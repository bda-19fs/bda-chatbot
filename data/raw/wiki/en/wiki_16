{"id": "3719867", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3719867", "title": "Boiled egg", "text": "Boiled egg\n\nBoiled eggs are eggs, typically from a chicken, cooked with their shells unbroken, usually by immersion in boiling water. Hard-boiled eggs are cooked so that the egg white and egg yolk both solidify, while soft-boiled eggs may leave the yolk, and sometimes the white, at least partially liquid and raw. Boiled eggs are a popular breakfast food around the world.\n\nBesides a boiling water immersion, there are a few different methods to make boiled eggs. Eggs can also be cooked below the boiling temperature, i.e. coddling, or they can be steamed. The egg timer was named for commonly being used to time the boiling of eggs.\n\nThere are variations both in degree of cooking and in the method of how eggs are boiled, and a variety of kitchen gadgets for eggs exist. These variations include:\n\nChef Heston Blumenthal, after \"relentless trials\", published a recipe for \"the perfect boiled egg\" suggesting cooking the egg in water that starts cold and covers the egg by no more than a millimeter, removing the pan from the heat as soon as the water starts to bubble. After six minutes, the egg will be ready.\n\nSoft-boiled eggs are not recommended for people who may be susceptible to salmonella, such as very young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. To avoid the issue of salmonella, eggs can be pasteurised in shell at 57 °C for an hour and 15 minutes. The eggs can then be soft-boiled as normal.\nSoft-boiled eggs are commonly served in egg cups, where the top of the egg is cut off with a knife, spoon, spring-loaded egg topper, or egg scissors, using a teaspoon to scoop the egg out. Other methods include breaking the eggshell by tapping gently around the top of the shell with a spoon. Soft-boiled eggs can be eaten with toast cut into strips, which are then dipped into the runny yolk. In the United Kingdom and Australia, these strips of toast are known as \"soldiers\".\n\nIn Southeast Asia, a variation of soft-boiled eggs known as half-boiled eggs are commonly eaten at breakfast. The major difference is that, instead of the egg being served in an egg cup, it is cracked into a bowl to which dark or light soy sauce or pepper are added. The egg is also cooked for a shorter period of time resulting in a runnier egg instead of the usual gelatin state and is commonly eaten with Kaya toast.\n\nBoiled eggs are also an ingredient in various Philippine dishes, such as embutido, pancit, relleno, galantina, and many others.\n\nIn Japan, soft-boiled eggs are commonly served alongside ramen. The eggs are typically steeped in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and water after being boiled and peeled. This provides the egg a brownish color that would otherwise be absent from boiling and peeling the eggs alone. Once the eggs have finished steeping, they are served either in the soup or on the side.\n\nHard-boiled eggs are boiled long enough for the yolk to solidify. They can be eaten warm or cold. Hard-boiled eggs are the basis for many dishes, such as egg salad, Cobb salad and Scotch eggs, and may be further prepared as deviled eggs.\n\nHard-boiled eggs are commonly sliced, particularly for use in sandwiches. For this purpose specialized egg slicers exist, to ease slicing and yield even slices.\n\nThere are several theories as to the proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is to bring water to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Another method is to bring the water to a boil, but then remove the pan from the heat and allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline. Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.\n\nHard-boiled eggs should be used within two hours if kept at room temperature or can be used for a week if kept refrigerated and in the shell.\n\nBoiled eggs can vary widely in how easy it is to peel away the shells. In general, the fresher an egg before boiling, the more difficult it is to separate the shell cleanly from the egg white. As a fresh egg ages, it gradually loses both moisture and carbon dioxide through pores in the shell; as a consequence, the contents of the egg shrink and the pH of the albumen becomes more basic. Albumen with higher pH (more basic) is less likely to stick to the egg shell, while pockets of air develop in eggs that have lost significant amounts of moisture, also making eggs easier to peel. Keeping the cooked eggs soaked in water helps keep the membrane under the egg shell moisturized for easy peeling. Peeling the egg under cold running water is an effective method of removing the shell. Starting the cooking in hot water also makes the egg easier to peel. It is often claimed that steaming eggs in a pressure cooker makes them easier to peel. However, double blind testing has failed to show any advantage of pressure cooking over steaming, and has further shown that starting boiling in cold water is counterproductive. Shocking the eggs by rapidly cooling them helped, and cooling them in ice water for 15 minutes or longer gave more successful peeling. Shocking was also found to remove the dimple in the base of the egg caused by the air space.\n\n\n"}

A traditional part of Kansas City barbecue, burnt ends are considered a delicacy in barbecue cooking. Either the entire brisket is cooked whole, then the point end removed and cooked further, or the point and flat are separated prior to cooking. Due to the higher fat content of the brisket point, it takes longer to fully cook to tender and render out fat and collagen. This longer cooking gave rise to the name \"burnt ends\". Sometimes when the flat is done, the point is returned to the smoker for further cooking. Some cooks re-season the point at this time. \n\nKansas City style burnt ends are usually served cubed with sauce either on top or on the side. A \"proper\" burnt end should display a modest amount of \"bark\" or char on at least one side. Burnt ends can be served alone (sometimes smothered in barbecue sauce) or in sandwiches, as well as in a variety of other dishes, including baked beans and French fries.\n\n"}
{"id": "3724690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3724690", "title": "Lake Worth Inlet", "text": "Lake Worth Inlet\n\nThe Palm Beach Inlet, also known as the Lake Worth Inlet is an artificial cut through a barrier island connecting the northern part of the Lake Worth Lagoon in Palm Beach County, Florida with the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered by the town of Palm Beach on the south, and by the town of Palm Beach Shores to the north. The inlet is also the entrance channel for the Port of Palm Beach. Its coordinates are .\n\nIn the mid-19th century the body of water that is now the Lake Worth Lagoon was a freshwater lake. This had been named \"Lake Worth\" in honor of William J. Worth, commander of the Eighth Infantry Regiment in the Second Seminole War. There were no rivers or streams flowing into the lake; all of the flow into the lake was by ground seepage from the Everglades to the west. The only outflow from the lake was through a swamp that became the Lake Worth Creek as it approached the Loxahatchee River and Jupiter Inlet.\n\nIn 1866 travelers reported that fresh water was pouring out of the lake into the ocean at a point about ten miles south of the Jupiter Inlet. One report is that a settler named Lang had dug the channel to open an inlet, and it was known as \"Lang's Inlet\" for a while. This cut drained the lake down to sea level. The limited inflow of ocean water through the inlet and continued seepage of fresh water from the Everglades kept the lake from becoming more than mildly brackish.\n\nThe inlet tended to silt up, and had to be dug out again every few months. In 1877 the settlers around the lake decided to dig a new inlet at a point about a mile north of Lang's Inlet where a rock formation called the \"Black Rocks\" would provide some protection for the inlet. The point chosen on the barrier island was only about 300 feet wide, but the beach dune ridge was 20 feet high and covered by heavy growth. All of the work was done with axes, shovels, hoes and wheelbarrows. It took 20 men several weeks to dig the new inlet.\n\nThe new inlet served its intended purpose well. The inlet tended to migrate south, however, with the current wearing away at the southern bank and depositing sand on the northern bank. By 1886 the inlet had migrated about a mile south of the Black Rocks, and closed up during a storm. An inlet was again dug through just south of the Black Rocks.\n\nIn 1893 Henry Flagler, who would complete construction of his Florida East Coast Railway to West Palm Beach in 1894, had the inlet enlarged. The federal government turned down a request to improve the inlet in 1912. In 1915 the Florida Legislature chartered the Lake Worth Inlet District (which later became the Port of Palm Beach District). The site of the original Lang's Inlet was chosen for the new inlet, which was completed in 1917.\n\nThe \"old\" inlet at the Black Rocks was still open. A community of fishermen from the Bahamas had settled on the barrier island just north of the Black Rocks, and they periodically cleared the channel when it silted up. A storm closed the inlet at the Black Rocks in 1919, and the fishermen, who were squatting on the island, were forced off by its owners and moved to Riviera (now Riviera Beach).\n\nThe \"new\" Lake Worth Inlet was improved several times over the next decade. The federal government assumed responsibility for the inlet in 1935, and continued to widen and deepen it and build up the jetties. In 1967 the inlet was dredged to a depth of 35 feet, which has been maintained since then. A sand transfer plant pumps sand from the north side of the inlet to the south side in order to maintain the natural flow of sand southward along the coast.\n\n\n"}

According to Spain's \"denominación de origen\" rules on food products, \"jamón ibérico\" may be made from black Iberian pigs, or cross-bred pigs so long as they are at least 50% \"ibérico\".\n\nThe black Iberian pig lives primarily in the central and southwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula, which includes both Portugal and Spain. In Spain, the black Iberian pig is typically found in the provinces of Huelva (protected denomination of origin \"Huelva\"), Córdoba (protected denomination of origin \"Valle de Los Pedroches\"), Cáceres, Badajoz (protected denomination of origin \"Dehesa de Extremadura\"), Salamanca, Ciudad Real, and Seville. In Portugal the central and southern regions have an abundance of this species, with a predilection for the Alentejo region. In Portugal, the black Iberian pig is commonly referred to as \"porco preto ibérico\" or \"porco alentejano\". The black Iberian pig is ingrained in the local Portuguese culture and tradition, with annual festivals in their honor, such as the Feira do Porco Preto, an annual festival in the region of Ourique. \n\nImmediately after weaning, the piglets are fattened on barley and maize for several weeks. The pigs are then allowed to roam in pasture and oak groves to feed naturally on grass, herbs, acorns, chestnuts, and roots, until the slaughtering time approaches. At that point, the diet may be strictly limited to olives, chestnuts or acorns for the best quality \"jamón ibérico\", or may be a mix of acorns and commercial feed for lesser qualities.\n\nThe hams from the slaughtered pigs are salted and left to begin drying for two weeks, after which they are rinsed and left to dry for another four to six weeks. The curing process then takes at least twelve months, although some producers cure their \"jamones ibéricos\" for up to 48 months.\n\nIn particular, the \"ibérico\" hams from the towns of Guijuelo in the Salamanca province and Jabugo in the Huelva province have their own \"denominación de origen\". Almost the entire town of Jabugo is devoted to the production of \"jamón ibérico\"; the biggest producer is 5J Sánchez Romero Carvajal. The town's main square is called \"La plaza del Jamón\".\n\nThe hams are labeled according to the pigs' diet and the percentage of the pigs' Iberian ancestry, with an acorn diet and pure-bred Iberians being most desirable. The current labeling system, based on a series of color-coded labels, was phased in starting in January 2014.\n\n\nAdditionally, the word \"puro\" (pure, referring to the breed) can be added to the previous qualities when both the father and mother of the slaughtered animal are of pure breed and duly registered on the pedigree books held by official breeders. Also, images of acorns and \"dehesas\" on product labels are restricted to hams that qualify as \"bellota\". The current labeling system also applies to \"paleta\" (front legs, with \"jamón\" coming from the hind leg) and \"caña de lomo\" (loin) cuts from Iberian pigs.\n\nAs of 2014, the term \"pata negra\" refers exclusively to the black label grade jamón ibérico de bellota' i.e. pure-bred Iberian pigs fed with an acorn only diet. The term refers to the color of the pigs' nails, which are white in most traditional pork (\"Sus domesticus\") breeds, but black for the Black Iberian breed. While as a general rule, a black nail should indicate an \"Ibérico\" ham, there are cases of counterfeits, with the nails being manually painted.\n\n\"Jamones de bellota\" are prized both for their smooth texture and rich, savory taste. A good \"ibérico\" ham has regular flecks of intramuscular fat (marbling).\n\nThe fat content is relatively high compared to \"jamón serrano\", thus giving a rich taste.\n\nThe denominations of origin recognized by the European Union of the Jamón ibérico are:\n\nAppellations of origin are legally protected by European Regulation (E.C.) No 510/2006 of the Council of the European Union; see Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union.\n\nCured meats have been specifically produced to be edible for a long time. The curing process was used for generations to preserve pork before the invention of refrigeration. During the curing process the meat is dried in salt, which helps to prevent the build-up of harmful organisms, and then is hung to be exposed to the elements, producing an exterior layer of mold which helps to protect the meat inside.\n\nNormally, jamón is sold either sliced and vacuum-packed or as a whole leg. Vacuum-packed jamón may last up to 100 days at room temperature due to the fact that the packaging seals out oxygen and slows down the aging process. A whole leg does not last as long. So long as the jamón is regularly cut and covered with clingfilm, or a cheese cloth, an opened leg may last for three months.\n\nFreezing is not recommended, since it damages the fibers in jamón and alters flavours.\n\nUntil 2007, \"jamón ibérico\" was not available in the United States (a fact referenced in the movie \"Perdita Durango\", where the ham of Jabugo is praised as \"illegal, but delicious\").\n\nPrior to 2005, only pigs raised and slaughtered outside Spain were allowed to be processed in Spain for export to the United States. In 2005, the first slaughterhouse in Spain, Embutidos y Jamones Fermín, S.L. (Salamanca), was approved by the United States Department of Agriculture to produce \"ibérico\" ham products for export to the United States.\n\nThe first \"jamones ibéricos\" were released for sale in the United States in December 2007, with the \"bellota\" hams following in July 2008. It is among the most expensive hams on the market.\n\n\n"}

It typically consists of pork and greens on a bed of rice noodles made from rice which has been soaked in lye water, giving them a characteristic texture and colour that sets the dish apart from other Vietnamese noodle dishes, including others from the same region, such as mì Quảng.\n\nThe main ingredients of cao lầu are rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The meat used is typically pork, either shredded or sliced char siu-style pork (\"xa xiu\"), but shrimp (\"tôm\") can also be used.\n\nThe rice noodles used in cao lầu are made from rice soaked in lye water, which gives them a chewy, springy texture and a grayish-brown or yellowish colour. Local legend suggests that the lye should be made by leaching the ashes of certain plants from the nearby Cham Islands, and that the water used in soaking the rice and boiling the noodles should be taken from the ancient Bá Lễ well in Hội An; for this reason, the legend states, cao lầu is rarely found outside the vicinity of Hội An. After soaking in the lye water, the rice is processed to make noodles at least 10cm long and 0.5cm wide, which are soaked in water for several hours, washed and boiled to taste. Some of the raw noodles are also cut into squares and deep-fried until crispy; these are used to top the dish when serving.\n\nThe meat used in cao lầu is typically pork which is marinated in five-spice powder, sugar, salt, pepper, crushed garlic, and soy sauce, to give a taste similar to char siu pork. Pork bones are also boiled to make the broth, along with onions or shallots.\n\nCao lầu is served with lettuce, bean sprouts and a number of fresh herbs (') such as mint, chives, perilla ('), lemon basil ('), Vietnamese coriander ('), cilantro (' or '), and water mint ('). A variety of other herbs may also be used in cao lầu, including mustard greens ('), chrysanthemum greens ('), common knotgrass ('), and heartleaf (\"\").\n\nA bowl of cao lầu is assembled by placing the noodles on a bed of fresh greens, bean sprouts and herbs. The marinated char siu pork is fried in a pan or wok until tender, made to cool, cut into thin slices (or, alternately, shredded), and placed on the noodles. Then, a small amount of broth (enough to wet the noodles) is poured over the contents of the bowl. Finally, the bowl is topped with the crispy squares and herbs, and served with lime and chili to taste. The dish is served at room temperature, and the contents of the bowl are mixed together before eating.\n\nThere are many variations of this dish in Hội An, some vary the way the pork is cooked (or omitted), using different greens (or absence of mint), sometimes topped with fried pork rind, peanuts, rice crackers, and/or scallions; and sometimes served with lime or chili jam. Other versions may add, or replace pork with, shrimp or chicken. Additional herbs may also be added. The pork broth is sometimes blended with dried shrimp/squid or chicken stock. When authentic cao lầu noodles are not available, other kinds of noodles can be used, such as linguine or soba noodles.\n\n\n"}

In top-loading machines, the ball accomplishes this with no user input, other than the initial loading, and filling of the ball.\n\nIn a top-loading washing machine, the ball floats on the surface of the water during the mild forces of the washing process, and remains sealed. The stronger forces of the later spin cycle causes the seal on the ball to be broken, releasing the liquid softener.\n\nThese balls can not be used in tumbling washers, because the tumbling releases the fabric softener before the rinse cycle.

In Western popular culture, its consumption is repeatedly portrayed and debated, often in the context of portraying exotic cultures as exceptionally cruel, callous, and/or strange.\n\nIt is unclear whether monkey brains have ever been served in a restaurant or whether the practice itself is an urban legend. Initial confusion over a translated term for the edible mushroom \"Hericium erinaceus\" may have played a part in the belief that monkey brains were used in Asian cuisine, as this mushroom is called hóu tóu gū (simplified: 猴头菇; traditional: 猴頭菇; lit. \"monkey head mushroom\") in Chinese.\n\nActual monkey brains were historically part of the Manchu Han Imperial banquet of the Qing Empire held during the 17th century, where they may have been eaten directly from the skull. Official Chinese policy on the procurement of certain wildlife species in the 21st century makes the serving of monkey brains illegal, with sentences of up to 10 years in prison for violators. \n\nBeyond Asia and into Africa, naturalist Angela Meder has described in \"Gorilla Journal\" a cultural practice of the Anaang people of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon whereby a new tribal chief would consume the brain of a hunted gorilla while another senior member of the tribe consumed the heart. According to this account, the practice occurred only in the specific instance of a new chiefdom, as the killing of gorillas would otherwise be forbidden. This tradition was reported as deprecated by the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nConsuming the brain and other nervous system tissues of some animals is considered hazardous to human health, possibly resulting in transmissible encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.\n\nA fictional depiction of the consumption of monkey brains is shown in the 1978 mondo film \"Faces of Death\", directed by John Alan Schwartz. The scene depicts an Eastern-themed restaurant with patrons seated around a table watching a belly dance. A narrator explains that these are tourists who have come to this location to consume \"the house specialty.\" The proprietor signals for a server to bring out a monkey, which is then secured inside a pen built into the table. The tourists are given hammers, and they proceed to hit the monkey on the head until it is killed. The server then cuts open the skull and removes the monkey's brains onto a plate for the patrons to sample. The film's director acknowledged that the scene, like much of the film, is fiction. The hammers were made of foam while the 'monkey's head' was a prop filled with gelatin, red food coloring, and cauliflower to simulate brain matter.\n\nAdditional depictions in the decade following the release of \"Faces of Death\" contain scenes which reference the practice of eating monkey brains, including one from the 1984 film \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\", as well as dialogue from the 1985 comedy \"Clue\". In addition to their shock value, what these scenes have in common are their representations of Orientalism, which according to author Sophia Rose Arjana, work as cinematic tropes used to \"conflate bizarre and vulgarized representations of the Far East\".\n"}

{"id": "3740426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3740426", "title": "Yogini", "text": "Yogini\n\nYogini (sometimes spelled jogan) is a Sanskrit term used to refer to a female master practitioner of yoga, as well as a formal term of respect for female Hindu or Buddhist spiritual teachers in Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Greater Tibet. The term is the feminine Sanskrit word of the masculine \"yogi\", while the term \"yogin\" is used in neutral, masculine or feminine sense. \n\nIn the Hindu tradition, the term \"yogini\" refers to women who are part of the Yoga school of Hindu traditions and to women who were part of the Gorakshanath-founded Nath Yogi tradition. A Yogini, in some contexts, refers to the sacred feminine force made incarnate, as an aspect of Parvati, and revered in yogini temples of India as the Eight Matrikas or the Sixty-four Yoginis. \n\nYogini also refers to women who are a part of Hindu and Buddhist tantra traditions. In Tantric Buddhism, Miranda Shaw states that a large number of women like Dombiyogini, Sahajayogicinta, Lakshminkara, Mekhala, Kankhala Gangadhara, Siddharajni, and others, were respected yoginis and advanced seekers on the path to enlightenment.\n\nIn the Tibetan Buddhism and Bön tradition, some ngagmas are comparable, in practice, to the Mahasidda yoginis of Indian Buddhism.\n\nYogini (jogan) is a term that finds reference in ancient and medieval texts in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, typically in the context of and as aspect of Devi. The \"Devi Sukta\" of the Rigveda 10.125.1 through 10.125.8, is among the most studied hymns declaring that the ultimate metaphysical reality (Brahman) is a Devi,\n\nThe Vedas include numerous goddesses including Ushas (dawn), Prithvi (earth), Aditi (cosmic moral order), Saraswati (river, knowledge), Vāc (sound), Nirṛti (destruction), Ratri (night), Aranyani (forest), and bounty goddesses such as Dinsana, Raka, Puramdhi, Parendi, Bharati, and Mahi among others are mentioned in the \"Rigveda\". However, the women are not discussed as frequently as men. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in the Vedic times, but in the post-Vedic texts, particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Universal Absolute, the Supreme power, Para Brahman.\nThe earliest evidence of Yogis and their spiritual tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Kesin hymn of the Vedas, where these yogins are praised. However, there is no mention that these Vedic era Yogi included women. Scholars note that some ancient Vedic sages (Rishis) were women. A female rishi is known as a \"rishika\".\n\nThe term \"yogini\" has been in use in medieval times to refer to a woman who belongs to the Gorakshanath-founded Nath Yogi tradition. They usually belong to Shaiva tradition, but some Natha belong to the Vaishnava tradition. In both cases, states David Lorenzen, they practice Yoga and their principal God tends to be \"Nirguna\", that is a God that is without form and semi-monistic, influenced in the medieval era by the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, Madhyamaka school of Buddhism, as well as Tantra and Yogic practices. Female yoginis were a large part of this tradition, and many 2nd-millennium paintings depict them and their Yoga practices. David Lorenzen states that the Nath yogis have been very popular with the rural population in South Asia, with medieval era tales and stories about Nath yogis continuing to be remembered in contemporary times, in the Deccan, western and northern states of India and in Nepal.\n\nIn medieval mythology such as Kathāsaritsāgara, \"yogini\" is also the name of a class of females with magical powers, fairies who are sorceresses sometimes enumerated as 8, 60, 64 or 65. The \"Hatha-Yoga-Pradipika\" text mentions Yogini.\n\nIn real life, historical evidence on \"Yogini Kaulas\" suggests that yogini tradition in Hinduism, who practiced Yoga philosophy and Tantra, were well established by the 10th century. This development was not limited to Hinduism, and included Yogini in Buddhist tantra traditions.\n\nThere are four major extant shrines of the Sixty-four Yogini (\"Chausathi jogan\"), among other spellings) in India (named for 64 legendary yogini), two in Odisha and two in Madhya Pradesh. One of the most impressive yogini temples in Odisha is the ninth century CE hypaethral Chausathi Jogini Temple located at Hirapur in Khurda district, 15 km south of Bhubaneshwar. Another hypaethral sixty-four yogini temple in Odisha is the Chausathi Yogini Pitha in Ranipur-Jharial, near Titilagarh in Balangir district. Two images of the Sixty-four Yogini are missing from this temple.\n\nTwo notable yogini temples in Madhya Pradesh are the ninth-century Chaunsath Yogini Temple to the southwest of the western group of temples in Khajuraho, near Chhatarpur in Chhatarpur District, and the 10th century CE Chaunsath Yogini Mandir in Bhedaghat, near Jabalpur in Jabalpur district.\n\nThe iconographies of the yogini images in four yogini temples are not uniform. In the Hirapur temple, all yogini images are with their \"vahanas\" (vehicles) and in standing posture. In Ranipur-Jharial temple the yogini images are in dancing posture. In Bhedaghat temple, yogini images are seated in \"Lalitasana\".\n\nThe Sixty-four yogini (Jogan) depicted in the complete Hirapur shrine are:\n\nOften the Matrikas are confused with the legendary yoginis, who may number sixty-four or eighty-one. In Sanskrit literature, the \"yoginis\" have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal yoginis are identified with the Matrikas. Other yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of 64 yogini from eight Matrikas became a tradition. By mid-11th century, the connection between yoginis and Matrikas had become common lore. The mandala (circle) and chakra of yoginis were used alternatively. The 81 yoginis evolve from a group of nine Matrikas, instead eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani (Aindri) and Chamundi) joined by Candika and Mahalakshmi form the nine-Matrika cluster. Each Matrika is considered to be a yogini and is associate with eight other yoginis resulting in the troupe of 81 (nine times nine). Some traditions have only seven Matrikas, and thus fewer yoginis.\n\n\n \n"}

Other flavor variations include passion fruit, mango, and berries such as raspberries, cranberries or blackberries. The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice, and zest, which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, flavorful spread. Some recipes also include egg whites or butter.\n\nIn late 19th- and early 20th-century England, homemade lemon curd was traditionally served with bread or scones at afternoon tea as an alternative to jam, and as a filling for cakes, small pastries, and tarts. Homemade lemon curd was usually made in relatively small amounts as it did not keep as well as jam. In more modern times, larger quantities became possible because of the use of refrigeration. Commercially manufactured curds often contain additional preservatives and thickening agents.\n\nContemporary commercially made curds remain a popular spread for bread, scones, toast, waffles, crumpets, pancakes, cheesecake, or muffins. They can also be used as a flavoring for desserts or yoghurt. Lemon-meringue pie, made with lemon curd and topped with meringue, has been a popular dessert in Britain and the United States since the nineteenth century. Lemon curd can also have whipped cream folded into it for such uses as filling cream puffs.\n\nCurds differ from pie fillings or custards in that they contain a higher proportion of juice and zest, which gives them a bolder, fruitier taste. Also, curds containing butter have a smoother and creamier texture than both pie fillings and custards, which contain little or no butter and use cornstarch or flour for thickening. Additionally, unlike custards, curds are not usually eaten on their own.\n\n"}

In the United States, the phrase \"Sicilian pizza\" is often synonymous with thick-crust pizza derived from the Sicilian \"sfincione\" .\n\nSicilian pizza is also known as \"sfincione\" or focaccia with toppings. This type of pizza became a popular dish in western Sicily by the mid-19th century and was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily until the 1860s. The version with tomatoes was not available prior to the 17th century. It eventually reached North America in a slightly altered form, with thicker crust and a rectangular shape.\n\nTraditional Sicilian pizza is often thick crusted and rectangular, but also round and similar to the Neapolitan pizza. It is often topped with onions, anchovies, tomatoes, herbs and strong cheese such as caciocavallo and toma. Other versions do not include cheese. \nThe Sicilian methods of making pizza are linked to local culture and country traditions, so there are differences in preparing pizza even among the Sicilian regions of Palermo, Catania, Siracusa and Messina.\n\nThe \"sfincione\" (or \"sfinciuni\" in Sicilian language) is a very common variety of pizza that originated in the province of Palermo. Unlike the more familiar Neapolitan pizza, it is typically rectangular, with more dough, sauce and cheese. An authentic recipe often calls for herbs, onion, tomato sauce, strong cheese and anchovies. The sauce is sometimes placed on top of the toppings to prevent it from soaking into the thick dough.\n\nIn the province of Siracusa, especially in Solarino and Sortino, the \"pizzòlu\" is a kind of round stuffed pizza.\n\nIn the province of Catania the traditional \"scacciata\" is made in two different ways: a first layer made of dough covered, within the city, by a local cheese (\"tuma\") and anchovies or, in the region around Catania, by potatoes, sausages, broccoli, and tomato sauce. In both cases a second layer of dough brushed with eggs covers everything. Also in the region of Catania, in Zafferana Etnea and in Viagrande a typical \"pizza siciliana\" is a fried calzone stuffed with cheese and anchovies.\n\nIn the province of Messina, the traditional \"piduni\" is a kind of calzone stuffed with endive, toma cheese, tomato and anchovies. There is also the \"focaccia alla messinese\", prepared with tomato sauce, toma cheese, vegetables and anchovies.\n\nIn the United States, \"Sicilian pizza\" is used to describe a typically square variety of cheese pizza with dough over an inch thick, a crunchy base, and an airy interior. It is derived from the \"sfinciuni\" and was introduced in the United States by the first Italian (Sicilian) immigrants. Sicilian-style pizza is popular in Italian-American enclaves throughout the northeastern United States, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Michigan, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey.\n"}

{"id": "3760018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3760018", "title": "Wahy", "text": "Wahy\n\nWaḥy (, ; also spelled wahi) is the Arabic word for revelation. In Islamic belief, revelations are God's Word delivered by his chosen individuals – known as Messenger prophets – to mankind. In Islam, the Quran is considered a wahy given to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The word \"awha\" ( \"\") occurs in a number of shades of meaning in the Quran, each of them indicating the main underlying idea of directing or guiding someone or something. For example, \"And inspired in each heaven its command,\" (Fussilat-12). \"And your lord inspired to the bee,\" (An Nahl-68). \"And we inspired to the mother of Mosses,\" (Al Qasas-7). Islamic scholars say that there is a clear difference between these kind of \"wahy \"and \"wahy\" to the Messenger Prophet. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. The word \"wahy\" (revelation) is derived from \"awha\".\n\nIn Islamic tradition, the verse of the Quran serves as the basis of understanding for \"wahy\". It says \"\"It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills\"\". Based on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in which God's revelation can reach His chosen individuals, especially prophets. An inspired message – not a word but an idea – can enter the heart of the chosen individuals either in the state of consciousness or in dream. The second mode, it is said, is the word heard by the person spoken to, like, from behind a veil. In the third mode, the revelation is sent from God through archangels like Gabriel and is delivered to the prophets. It is the highest form of revelation, and Muslims believe the whole Quran was revealed in this mode.\n\nAccording to Islamic scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani, God has created three media through which humans receive knowledge: men’s senses, the faculty of reason, and the divine revelation; and it is the third one that addresses the liturgical and eschatological issues, answers the questions regarding God's purpose behind creating mankind, and acts as a guidance for the mankind as to choosing the correct way. In Islamic belief, the sequence of divine revelation came to an end with Muhammad.\n\nAs regard to revelation received by Muhammad, Muslim sources mention various modes in which they believe revelation came to him. Muslim scholar Muhammad Shafi Usmani has summarized five modes of descent. The common mode was that Muhammad would hear sound like \"the ringing of a bell\" after which he found the message committed to his memory. Sometimes, the arch angel would come in human shape, most often of Dahya al-Kalbi. In two cases, Gabriel appeared in his real form. Once, on the night of Miraj, Muhammad is believed to have had a direct conversation with God. In the fifth mode, Gabriel would let the revelation enter into Muhammad’s heart.\n\nA number of Western historians have addressed the question of whether Muhammad was sincere when he reported receiving revelations. Around a hundred years ago, Thomas Carlyle in his lectures, \"On Heroes\", vigorously defended Muhammad arguing that one can only accuse him of insincerity if one fails to understand Islam and its worldwide success. Carlyle's view has been increasingly influential ever since and contemporary historians tend to say that as far as can be ascertained Muhammad did believe that he was hearing the word of God.\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt argues that only Muhammad's sincerity can explain his \"readiness to endure hardship and persecution during the Meccan period when from a secular point of view there was no prospect of success\". \"To carry on in the face of persecution and hostility would have been impossible for him unless he was fully persuaded that God had sent him\".\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt presents the following possibilities for the sources of Qur'an:\n\nSometimes he [Muhammad] may have heard the words being spoken to him, but for most part he seems simply to have \"found them in his heart\". Whatever the precise \"manner of revelation\"-and several different 'manners' were listed by Muslim scholars- the important point is that the message was not the product of Muhammad's conscious mind. He believed he could easily distinguish between his own thinking and these revelations. His sincerity in this belief must be accepted by the modern historian, for this alone makes credible the development of a great religion. The further question, however, whether the messages came from Muhammad's unconscious, or the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source, is beyond the competence of the historian.\n\nWatt notes, To say that Muhammad was sincere does not imply that he was correct in his beliefs. A man maybe sincere but mistaken. The modern Westerner has not difficulty in showing how Muhammad may have been mistaken. What seems to a man to come from 'outside himself' may actually come from his unconscious.\n\nAccording to historian Welch, \nThe really powerful factor in Muhammad's life and the essential clue to his extraordinary success was his unshakable belief from beginning to end that he had been called by God. A conviction such as this, which, once firmly established, does not admit of the slightest doubt, exercises an incalculable influence on others. The certainty with which he came forward as the executor of God's will gave his words and ordinances an authority that proved finally compelling.\n\nCritics point to various pre-existing sources to argue against the traditional narrative. Some scholars have calculated that one-third of the Quran has pre-Islamic Christian origins. Aside from the Bible, Quran relies on several Apocryphal and legendary sources, like the Protoevangelium of James, Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, and several infancy gospels. Several narratives rely on Jewish Midrash Tanhuma legends, like the narrative of Cain learning to bury the body of Abel in Surah 5:31. Surah 21, which tells of Abraham destroying the idols, after which he is delivered by God from being thrown into the fire, is a legend found in the Midrash Rabbah. Critics, like Norman Geisler argue that the dependence of the Quran on pre-existing sources is one evidence of a purely human origin. Richard Carrier regards this reliance on pre-Islamic Christian sources, as evidence that Islam derived from a heretical sect of Christianity.\n\n\n"}

The buns are filled with barbecue-flavored cha siu pork. They are served as a type of dim sum during \"yum cha\" and are sometimes sold in Chinese bakeries.\" Cha siu\" refers to the pork filling; the word \"bao\" means \"bun\".\n\nThere are two major kinds of cha siu bao, the traditional steamed version is called () or simply (), while the baked variety is usually called (). Steamed cha siu bao has a white exterior, while the baked variety is browned and glazed.\n\nAlthough visually similar to other types of steamed baozi, the dough of steamed \"cha siu bao\" is unique since it makes use of both yeast and baking powder as leavening. This unique mix of leavening gives the dough of \"cha siu bao\" the texture of a slightly dense, but fine soft bread.\n\nEncased in the center of the bun is tender, sweet, slow-roasted pork tenderloin. This \"cha siu\" is diced, and then mixed into a syrupy mixture of oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, roasted sesame seed oil, rice vinegar, shaoxing wine or dry sherry, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch.\n\nIn Hawaii, the item is called manapua. Its name is a shortening of the Hawaiian \"mea ono puaa\", meaning, \"delicious pork thing.\" In the U.S. mainland, the Chinese term is commonly used. The Chinese brought this \"dim sum\" item with them when they were brought over as plantation workers. In American Samoa and its surrounding islands, the item is referred to as keke pua'a, literally meaning \"pig cake\".\n\nThis food usually consists of a white bun with a dark pink-colored diced pork filling. The Hawaiian version of the cha siu bao tends to be larger than its Chinese cousin and can be either steamed or baked. In Hawaii starting in the plantation era, Manapua sellers were and still are a common oucurence. The Manapua seller figure has even become an iconic symbol of Hawaii. The red pork filling's dark pink color comes from marinating the pork with a very small amount of saltpeter prior to slow roasting.

The tradition has been far rarer historically than primogeniture (sole inheritance by the first-born) or partible inheritance (division of the estate among the children).\n\nUltimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of \"keeping the hearth\", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults.\n\nThere are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture. One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded.\n\nCoercion, assassination, fratricide, or even patricide can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped.\nTo clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist.\n\n\n\n"}

Notable dishes include gazpacho, fried fish (often called \"pescaíto frito\" in the local vernacular), the jamones of Jabugo, Valle de los Pedroches and Trevélez, and the wines of Jerez, particularly sherry.\n\nFrying in Andalucian cuisine is dominated by the use of olive oil that is produced in the provinces of Jaén, Córdoba, Seville, and Granada. Málaga, Almería, Cádiz and Huelva produces olive oil too, but in smaller amounts.\nThe foods are dredged in flour \"a la Andaluza\" (meaning only flour, without egg or other ingredients, but may include flour from the chickpea especially for use in batters). They are then fried in a large quantity of hot olive oil.\n\nWith five coastal provinces, the consumption of fish and shellfish is rather high: white shrimp from the Bay of Cádiz; prawns; murex; anchovies; baby squid; cuttlefish; \"bocas de la Isla\", a dish found in San Fernando that uses a local crab that can regenerate its claw; flounder; etc.\n\nAndalucian cuisine includes also some unusual seafood, like \"ortiguillas\", sea anemones in batter.\n\nAndalucian desserts are heavily influenced by Arabic medieval Andalucian cuisine. Notable dishes include pestiños (a deep-fried pastry bathed in honey), alfajores, amarguillos (a form of almond macaroons) from Medina Sidonia, the polvorones (almond cookies of Estepa), lard bread, wine doughnuts, torrijas and Calentitos.\n\nThe wines of Jerez (also known as sherry) are famous the world over, praised even by William Shakespeare.

{"id": "3779011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3779011", "title": "Neotantra", "text": "Neotantra\n\nNeotantra, navatantra (Sanskrit: नव, \"nava\" 'new') or tantric sex, is the modern, western variation of tantra often associated with new religious movements. This includes both New Age and modern Western interpretations of traditional Hindu and Buddhist tantra. Some of its proponents refer to ancient and traditional texts and principles, and many others use tantra as a catch-all phrase for \"sacred sexuality\", and may incorporate unorthodox practices. In addition, not all of the elements of Indian tantric practices are used in neotantra, in particular the reliance on a guru. As the interest in Tantra has grown in the West, its perception deviates remarkably from the Tantric traditions. It was seen as a \"cult of ecstasy,” combining sexuality and spirituality to change Western attitudes towards sex. Hence for many modern readers Tantra is now synonymous with \"spiritual sex\" or \"sacred sexuality,\" a belief that sex should be recognized as a sacred act capable of elevating its participants to a higher spiritual plane.\n\nAs tantric practice became known in western culture, which has escalated since the 1960s, it has become identified with its sexual methods in the West. Consequently, its essential nature as a spiritual practice is often overlooked. The roles of sexuality in tantra and in neotantra, while related, are actually quite different, reflecting substantial differences in their cultural contexts.\n\nSir John George Woodroffe, also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon, was a British Orientalist whose work helped to unleash in the West a deep and wide interest in Hindu philosophy and Yogic practices. Alongside his judicial duties he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy and was especially interested in Hindu Tantra. He translated some twenty original Sanskrit texts and published and lectured prolifically on Indian philosophy and a wide range of Yoga and Tantra topics. Woodroffe's \"The Serpent Power – The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga\", is a source for many modern Western adaptations of Kundalini yoga practice. It is a philosophically sophisticated commentary on, and translation of, the \"Satcakra-nirupana\" (\"Description of and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centres\") of Purnananda (dated around AD 1550) and the \"Paduka-Pancaka\" (\"Five-fold Footstool of the Guru\"). The term \"Serpent Power\" refers to the kundalini, an energy said to be released within an individual by meditation techniques.\n\nPierre Bernard was a pioneering American yogi, scholar, occultist, philosopher, mystic, and businessman. He claimed to have traveled to Kashmir and Bengal before founding the Tantrik Order of America in 1905. He eventually expanded to a chain of tantric clinics in places such as Cleveland, Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City. Bernard is widely credited with being the first American to introduce the philosophy and practices of yoga and tantra to the American people. He also played a critical role in establishing a greatly exaggerated association of tantra with the use of sex for mystical purposes in the American mindset.\n\nMany teachers of this version of tantra believe that sex and sexual experiences are sacred acts, which are capable of elevating their participants to a higher spiritual plane. They often talk about raising Kundalini energy, worshipping the divine feminine and the divine masculine, activating the chakras. In this context, the word \"tantra\", generally refers to the set of techniques for cultivating a more fulfilling sexual or loving relationship. On the other hand, there are also some truly dedicated scholars and teachers in the field of modern tantra.\n\nGuru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, later known as Osho, used his version of tantra in combination with breathing techniques, bio-energy, yoga, and massage in some of the groups at his ashram. He is the author of many books on meditation, taoism, buddhism, and mysticism, and at least six on tantra. One of them is \"Tantra, The Supreme Understanding\", in which he unpacks the verses of the \"Song of Mahamudra\", by Tilopa. In addition out of his discourses on the Vigyan Bhiarav (or Vijnaya-bhairava), the 112 practices for enlightenment resulted in the much longer \"The Book of Secrets\". His students continue to develop his concepts.\n\nOne of Osho's students, Margot Anand, founded a school called \"Skydancing\" tantra. She is the author of dozens of books including the \"Art of Everyday Ecstasy\", and the \"Art of Sexual Magic\". Currently, she is of the opinion that sex is a limitation...awakening or enlightenment means transcend of all which is fenomenal, temporary and transient. Another modern tantrika is Daniel Odier who believes that desire can be a valid pathway to transcendence. Sexologists, porn star and mother of Yoni massage Annie Sprinkle and Joseph Kramer and father of Lingham massage are two examples of practitioners who teach sacred erotic massage.\nJoseph Kramer is known to have developed Tao Erotic Massage. Andro Andreas Rothe (German Zen Monk) developed Tantra Massage and Tantra Erotic Massage.\n\nErotic, which is not necessarily sexual, refers to a massage that massages the primary erogenous zones of the body, that is penis, anus, vagina, or mouth. Shakti Verah Andro's direct student, and Sri Moojiji (Advaita master) direct disciple, take the view that herogenous zones are totally a-sexual organs. Verah works with the body through tantra massage and tantra erotic massage to point to the no body. She does not seem to pay any attention to sexual energy—in her words: \"sexuality is the highest state of duality. As such, unless we transcend sex, we cannot rise beyond our basic ordinary human condition which is marked by life, procreation, death. Oneness is sexless, gender is bodiless.\"\n\nIn 1997 Deborah Anapol convened a national Celebration of Eros, \"a Conference on Sacred Sexuality, bringing together for the first time, teachers from Tantric, Taoist, Sufi, Buddhist, Jewish, Pagan, Hindu, Shinto, Wiccan, Occult, Native American, and Afro-Caribbean traditions.\"\n\nGeorg Feuerstein, a German Indologist who also trained in tantra, writes in the epilogue of his book \"Tantra: Path of Ecstasy\":\n\"Many are attracted to Neo-Tantrism because it promises sexual excitement or fulfillment while clothing purely genital impulses or neurotic emotional needs in an aura of spirituality. If we knew more about the history of Tantra in India, we would no doubt find a comparable situation for every generation.\" He goes on to say, \"Today translations of several major Tantras are readily available in book form... This gives would-be Tantrics the opportunity to concoct their own idiosyncratic ceremonies and philosophies, which they can then promote as Tantra.\"\n\nResponding to criticism of modern Western Tantra, Geoffrey Samuel, a historian of Indian and Tibetan Tantra writes:\nAccording to author and critic of religion and politics Hugh Urban:\n\n\n"}

The great mountainous nature of the Basque Country has led to a difference between coastal cuisine dominated by fish and seafood, and inland cuisine with fresh and cured meats, many vegetables and legumes, and freshwater fish and salt cod. The French and Spanish influence is strong also, with a noted difference between the cuisine of either side of the modern border; even iconic Basque dishes and products, such as txakoli from the South, or Gâteau Basque (Biskotx) and Jambon de Bayonne from the North, are rarely seen on the other side.\n\nBasques have also been quick to absorb new ingredients and techniques from new settlers and from their own trade and exploration links. Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal created a chocolate and confectionery industry in Bayonne still well-known today, and part of a wider confectionery and pastry tradition across the Basque Country. Basques embraced the potato and the capsicum, used in hams, sausages and recipes, with pepper festivals around the area, notably Ezpeleta and Puente la Reina.\n\nOlive oil is more commonly used than vegetable oil in Basque cooking.\n\nCuisine and the kitchen are at the heart of Basque culture, and there is a Museum of Gastronomy in Llodio.\n\nOne of the staple cookbooks for traditional Basque dishes was initially published in 1933. \"La cocina de Nicolasa\" (the Kitchen of Nicolasa) by Nicolasa Pradera has gone into 20 editions.\n\nIn addition to the dishes and products of the Basque Country, there are features of the way of preparing and sharing food unique to the area.\n\nCider houses (sagardotegiak) are a feature of the hills around Donostia, especially near Astigarraga. These are usually large country restaurants with enormous barrels of cider. Cider is poured from a height straight into the glass for visitors, with a rustic menu invariably of salt cod omelette, grilled T-bone steak and ewes' milk cheese with walnuts and quince paste. The cider houses are only open for a few months of the year.\n\nThe \"txikiteo\" is the tapas crawl from bar to bar seen across Spain, but it reaches its pinnacle in Donostia, with hundreds of people on the streets of the old town wandering from bar to bar, each known for its specialty, whether it be croquettes, tortilla, toast, or seafood. The txikiteo is also popular in cities such as Pamplona and Bilbao.\n\n\"Gerezi beltza arno gorriakin\" is a cherry soup served warm or cold. The cherries are poached in wine, often with enough sugar added to make a light syrup. A cherry without pits is preferred for this dish. To release their flavor, the cherries are carefully pitted or cut in half. Usually the soup is prepared on the day it will be served, because 24 hours is enough time for the cherries to blanch noticeably in the liquid. The soup is often served with a dollop of sour cream, crème fraîche, or ice cream.\n\nGastronomic societies are organisations, almost always of men, who cook and eat together in a communal txoko. In large cities, the society's premises can be large and formally organised, but the \"txoko\" is frequently a small space owned by a group of friends in smaller towns and suburbs, where food and costs are shared. The first txoko was noted in Donostia in 1870. This unique feature of the Spanish Basque Country enables men to participate in the cooking process and spend time together away from the traditionally formidable matriarchs (\"etxekoandreak\"). In recent years, women have been allowed into some clubs.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s Basque chefs were influenced by the \"nouvelle cuisine\" of France and created the \"nouvelle cuisine basque\", radically original in its form but solidly Basque in substance, with lighter and less rustic versions of traditional dishes and flavours. The first Spanish restaurant to be awarded 3 stars in the Michelin Guide was, in fact, \"Zalacaín\", a Basque restaurant, although located in Madrid. Juan Mari Arzak in Donostia became the most famous exponent and one of the first three-star Michelin Guide restaurants in Spain.\nIn a few years the movement swept across Spain, becoming the state's default haute cuisine. Many tapas bars, especially in San Sebastián, serve modern-style \"pintxos\" employing novel techniques and ingredients. In more recent years, young chefs, such as Martin Berasategui, have given new impetus to Basque cuisine.\n\nBasque cuisine has continued to have an influence on international cuisine, particularly in Spain and France where it is highly regarded. Catalan chef Ferran Adrià has taken the techniques pioneered by Arzak and other Basque chefs to new heights. Karlos Arguiñano has popularised Basque cuisine in Spain through TV and books. Teresa Barrenechea was among the first people to bring traditional Basque cuisine to America with her first restaurant Marichu in Bronxville in 1991, where she hired Chef Joseba Encabo to set up, develop the menus and run the restaurant till soon later he was offered a position as faculty at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Teresa Barrenechea and husband Raynold von Samson continued to promote Basque cuisine in America by opening their second Marichu restaurant in Manhattan in 1994, which was close to the United Nations Headquarters. Teresa Barrenechea has written two books, \"The Basque Table\" (Harvard Common Press, Boston 1998) and \"The Cuisines of Spain\" (Ten Speed, Berkley 2005). Teresa Barrenechea is the holder of two awards: Premio Nacional de Gastronomía (National Prize of Gastronomy, the highest culinary award given by the Spanish Administration) and Best Regional Cuisine Book at the 5th World Cookbook Fair, Périgueux (France). At the other end of the scale, Basque-style pintxos bars are common in Barcelona and Madrid. In cities where large numbers of Basque people emigrated, such as Buenos Aires, Argentina; São Paulo, Brazil, Boise, Idaho; Fresno, California, and Bakersfield, California, there are several Basque restaurants and a noted Basque influence on the local cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Salterns include modern salt-making works, as well as hypersaline waters that usually contain high concentrations of halophilic microorganisms, primarily haloarchaea but also other halophiles including algae and bacteria.\n\nSalterns usually begin with seawater as the initial source of brine but may also use natural saltwater springs and streams. The water is evaporated, usually over a series of ponds, to the point where sodium chloride and other salts precipitate out of the saturated brine, allowing pure salts to be harvested. Where complete evaporation in this fashion was not routinely achievable due to weather, salt was produced from the concentrated brine by boiling the brine.\n\nEarliest examples of pans used in the solution mining of salt date back to prehistoric times and the pans were made of ceramics known as briquetage. Later examples were made from lead and then iron. The change from lead to iron coincided with a change from wood to coal for the purpose of heating the brine. Brine would be pumped into the pans, and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed these would be raked out and more brine added. In warmer climates no additional heat would be supplied, the sun's heat being sufficient to evaporate off the brine.\n\nOne of the earliest salterns for the harvesting of salt is argued to have taken place on Lake Yuncheng, Shanxi, China by 6000 BC. Strong archaeological evidence of salt making dating to 2000 BC is found in the ruins of Zhongba at Chongqing.\n\n"}

{"id": "3824661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3824661", "title": "High availability", "text": "High availability\n\nHigh availability (HA) is a characteristic of a system, which aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.\n\nModernization has resulted in an increased reliance on these systems. For example, hospitals and data centers require high availability of their systems to perform routine daily activities. Availability refers to the ability of the user community to obtain a service or good, access the system, whether to submit new work, update or alter existing work, or collect the results of previous work. If a user cannot access the system, it is – from the users point of view – \"unavailable\". Generally, the term \"downtime\" is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.\n\nThere are three principles of systems design in reliability engineering which can help achieve high availability.\n\n\nA distinction can be made between scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Typically, scheduled downtime is a result of maintenance that is disruptive to system operation and usually cannot be avoided with a currently installed system design. Scheduled downtime events might include patches to system software that require a reboot or system configuration changes that only take effect upon a reboot. In general, scheduled downtime is usually the result of some logical, management-initiated event. Unscheduled downtime events typically arise from some physical event, such as a hardware or software failure or environmental anomaly. Examples of unscheduled downtime events include power outages, failed CPU or RAM components (or possibly other failed hardware components), an over-temperature related shutdown, logically or physically severed network connections, security breaches, or various application, middleware, and operating system failures.\n\nIf users can be warned away from scheduled downtimes, then the distinction is useful. But if the requirement is for true high availability, then downtime is downtime whether or not it is scheduled.\n\nMany computing sites exclude scheduled downtime from availability calculations, assuming that it has little or no impact upon the computing user community. By doing this, they can claim to have phenomenally high availability, which might give the illusion of continuous availability. Systems that exhibit truly continuous availability are comparatively rare and higher priced, and most have carefully implemented specialty designs that eliminate any single point of failure and allow online hardware, network, operating system, middleware, and application upgrades, patches, and replacements. For certain systems, scheduled downtime does not matter, for example system downtime at an office building after everybody has gone home for the night.\n\nAvailability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year. The following table shows the downtime that will be allowed for a particular percentage of availability, presuming that the system is required to operate continuously. Service level agreements often refer to monthly downtime or availability in order to calculate service credits to match monthly billing cycles. The following table shows the translation from a given availability percentage to the corresponding amount of time a system would be unavailable.\n\nUptime and availability can be used synonymously as long as the items being discussed are kept consistent. That is, a system can be up, but its services are not available, as in the case of a network outage. This can also be viewed as a system that is available to be worked on, but its services are not up from a functional perspective (as opposed to software service/process perspective). The perspective is important here - whether the item being discussed is the server hardware, server OS, functional service, software service/process...etc. Keep the perspective consistent throughout a discussion, then uptime and availability can be used synonymously.\n\nPercentages of a particular order of magnitude are sometimes referred to by the number of nines or \"class of nines\" in the digits. For example, electricity that is delivered without interruptions (blackouts, brownouts or surges) 99.999% of the time would have 5 nines reliability, or class five. In particular, the term is used in connection with mainframes or enterprise computing, often as part of a service-level agreement.\n\nSimilarly, percentages ending in a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of nines, then \"five\", so 99.95% is \"three nines five\", abbreviated 3N5. This is casually referred to as \"three and a half nines\", but this is incorrect: a 5 is only a factor of 2, while a 9 is a factor of 10, so a 5 is 0.3 nines (per below formula: formula_1): 99.95% availability is 3.3 nines, not 3.5 nines. More simply, going from 99.9% availability to 99.95% availability is a factor of 2 (0.1% to 0.05% unavailability), but going from 99.95% to 99.99% availability is a factor of 5 (0.05% to 0.01% unavailability), over twice as much.\n\nA formulation of the \"class of 9s\" formula_2 based on a system's unavailability formula_3 would be\n\n(cf. Floor and ceiling functions).\n\nA similar measurement is sometimes used to describe the purity of substances.\n\nIn general, the number of nines is not often used by a network engineer when modeling and measuring availability because it is hard to apply in formula. More often, the unavailability expressed as a probability (like 0.00001), or a downtime per year is quoted. Availability specified as a number of nines is often seen in marketing documents. The use of the \"nines\" has been called into question, since it does not appropriately reflect that the impact of unavailability varies with its time of occurrence. For large amounts of 9s, the \"unavailability\" index (measure of downtime rather than uptime) is easier to handle. For example, this is why an \"unavailability\" rather than availability metric is used in hard disk or data link bit error rates.\n\nAvailability measurement is subject to some degree of interpretation. A system that has been up for 365 days in a non-leap year might have been eclipsed by a network failure that lasted for 9 hours during a peak usage period; the user community will see the system as unavailable, whereas the system administrator will claim 100% uptime. However, given the true definition of availability, the system will be approximately 99.9% available, or three nines (8751 hours of available time out of 8760 hours per non-leap year). Also, systems experiencing performance problems are often deemed partially or entirely unavailable by users, even when the systems are continuing to function. Similarly, unavailability of select application functions might go unnoticed by administrators yet be devastating to users — a true availability measure is holistic.\n\nAvailability must be measured to be determined, ideally with comprehensive monitoring tools (\"instrumentation\") that are themselves highly available. If there is a lack of instrumentation, systems supporting high volume transaction processing throughout the day and night, such as credit card processing systems or telephone switches, are often inherently better monitored, at least by the users themselves, than systems which experience periodic lulls in demand.\n\nAn alternative metric is mean time between failures (MTBF).\n\nRecovery time (or estimated time of repair (ETR), also known as recovery time objective (RTO) is closely related to availability, that is the total time required for a planned outage or the time required to fully recover from an unplanned outage. Another metric is mean time to recovery (MTTR). Recovery time could be infinite with certain system designs and failures, i.e. full recovery is impossible. One such example is a fire or flood that destroys a data center and its systems when there is no secondary disaster recovery data center.\n\nAnother related concept is data availability, that is the degree to which [database]]s and other information storage systems faithfully record and report system transactions. Information management often focuses separately on data availability in order to determine acceptable (or actual) data loss with various failure events. Some users can tolerate application service interruptions but cannot tolerate data loss.\n\nA service level agreement (\"SLA\") formalizes an organization's availability objectives and requirements.\n\nHigh availability is one of the primary requirements of the control systems in unmanned vehicles and autonomous maritime vessels. If the controlling system becomes unavailable, the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) or ASW Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) would be lost.\n\nAdding more components to an overall system design can undermine efforts to achieve high availability because complex systems inherently have more potential failure points and are more difficult to implement correctly. While some analysts would put forth the theory that the most highly available systems adhere to a simple architecture (a single, high quality, multi-purpose physical system with comprehensive internal hardware redundancy), this architecture suffers from the requirement that the entire system must be brought down for patching and operating system upgrades. More advanced system designs allow for systems to be patched and upgraded without compromising service availability (see load balancing and failover).\n\nHigh availability requires less human intervention to restore operation in complex systems; the reason for this being that the most common cause for outages is human error.\n\nRedundancy is used to create systems with high levels of availability (e.g. aircraft flight computers). In this case it is required to have high levels of failure detectability and avoidance of common cause failures. Two kinds of redundancy are passive redundancy and active redundancy.\n\nPassive redundancy is used to achieve high availability by including enough excess capacity in the design to accommodate a performance decline. The simplest example is a boat with two separate engines driving two separate propellers. The boat continues toward its destination despite failure of a single engine or propeller. A more complex example is multiple redundant power generation facilities within a large system involving electric power transmission. Malfunction of single components is not considered to be a failure unless the resulting performance decline exceeds the specification limits for the entire system.\n\nActive redundancy is used in complex systems to achieve high availability with no performance decline. Multiple items of the same kind are incorporated into a design that includes a method to detect failure and automatically reconfigure the system to bypass failed items using a voting scheme. This is used with complex computing systems that are linked. Internet routing is derived from early work by Birman and Joseph in this area. Active redundancy may introduce more complex failure modes into a system, such as continuous system reconfiguration due to faulty voting logic.\n\nZero downtime system design means that modeling and simulation indicates mean time between failures significantly exceeds the period of time between planned maintenance, upgrade events, or system lifetime. Zero downtime involves massive redundancy, which is needed for some types of aircraft and for most kinds of communications satellites. Global Positioning System is an example of a zero downtime system.\n\nFault instrumentation can be used in systems with limited redundancy to achieve high availability. Maintenance actions occur during brief periods of down-time only after a fault indicator activates. Failure is only significant if this occurs during a mission critical period.\n\nModeling and simulation is used to evaluate the theoretical reliability for large systems. The outcome of this kind of model is used to evaluate different design options. A model of the entire system is created, and the model is stressed by removing components. Redundancy simulation involves the N-x criteria. N represents the total number of components in the system. x is the number of components used to stress the system. N-1 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where one component is faulted. N-2 means the model is stressed by evaluating performance with all possible combinations where two component are faulted simultaneously.\n\nA survey among academic availability experts in 2010 ranked reasons for unavailability of enterprise IT systems. All reasons refer to not following best practice in each of the following areas (in order of importance):\n\n\nA book on the factors themselves was published in 2003.\n\nIn a 1998 report from IBM Global Services, unavailable systems were estimated to have cost American businesses $4.54 billion in 1996, due to lost productivity and revenues.\n\n"}

After an outer layer of thin skin is removed, most of the edible tissue on the feet consists of skin and tendons, with no muscle. This gives the feet a distinct texture different from the rest of the chicken's meat. Being mostly skin, chicken feet are very gelatinous.\n\nChicken feet are used in several regional Chinese cuisines; they can be served as a beer snack, cold dish, soup or main dish. They are interchangeably called \"Fèng zhuǎ\" (鳯爪, phoenix claws), \"Jī zhuǎ\" (鷄爪, chicken claws), and \"Jī jiǎo\" (雞脚, chicken feet).\n\nIn Guangdong and Hong Kong, they are typically deep fried and steamed first to make them puffy before being stewed and simmered in a sauce flavoured with black fermented beans, bean paste, and sugar; or in abalone sauce.\n\nIn mainland China, popular snack bars specializing in marinated food such as \"yabozi\" (duck's necks) also sell \"lu ji zhua\" (鹵雞爪, marinated chicken feet), which are simmered with soy sauce, Sichuanese peppercorn, clove, garlic, star anise, cinnamon and chili flakes. Today, packaged chicken feet are sold in most grocery stores and supermarkets in China as a snack, often seasoned with rice vinegar and chili. Another popular recipe is \"bai yun feng zhao\" (白雲鳯爪), which is marinated in a sauce of rice vinegar, rice wine flavored with sugar, salt, and minced ginger for an extended period of time and served as a cold dish. In southern China, they also cook chicken feet with raw peanuts to make a thin soup.\n\nThe huge demand in China raises the price of chicken feet, which are often used as fodder in other countries. As of June 2011, 1 kg of raw chicken feet costs around 12 to 16 yuan in China, compared to 11–12 yuan for 1 kg of frozen chicken breast. In 2000, Hong Kong, once the largest \"entrepôt\" for shipping chicken feet from over 30 countries, traded a total of 420,000 tons of chicken feet at the value of US$230 million. Two years after joining the WTO in 2001, China approved the direct import of American chicken feet, and since then China has been the major destination of chicken feet from around the globe.\n\nAside from chicken feet, duck feet are also popular. Duck feet with mustard, which is often served with vinegar, fresh green pepper and crushed garlic, is a popular salad/appetizer.\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova, chicken feet are cleaned, seasoned, and boiled, often with vegetables, and then cooled, to make an aspic called kholodets in Russian and Ukrainian, and piftie or \"răcitură\" in Romanian. The legs are not always eaten, however the chicken is cooked with its legs, as they contain a high amount of gelatin.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, chicken feet are known as \"ceker\", and it is a common popular delicacy in Indonesia, especially in Java. The most common way to serve chicken feet in Indonesia is in spicy traditional soup called \"soto\", nevertheless, the Chinese style dimsum chicken feet is also available in some Chinese restaurants in Indonesia. \"Soto ceker\" is chicken foot served in rather clear yellowish spicy \"soto\" broth soup, which uses spices including ground shallot, garlic, galangal, ginger, candlenut, bruised lemongrass, \"daun salam\" (Indonesian bayleaf) and turmeric that add the yellowish color, served with cabbage, celery, rice noodles, and garnished to taste with \"sambal\", lime and soy.\n\n\"Soto ceker\" is one of the popular street food in Jakarta, Bali, Surabaya, Bandung, and most of major cities in Indonesia. In street side \"warung\" or humble restaurants, \"soto ceker\" is usually offered as a variation of popular \"soto ayam\" (chicken soto), which employ the identical soup base with chicken soto. A popular \"soto ceker\" stall such as Soto Ceker Pak Ali in Gandaria street, South Jakarta, can use up to 40 kilograms of chicken feet every day, although the stall is only open from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m., and can reap Rp 5 million (US$360) in sales each day.\n\nAnother popular way to prepare chicken feet is serving it in simple soup (\"sop\" or \"sup\") called \"sop ceker\", which mainly contains chicken broth, chicken feet, vegetables especially potato and carrot, shallot, garlic and black pepper. The deep fried peeled chicken feet, which has been separated from its bones, might be served as a crispy snack treat as \"kripik ceker\" (chicken feet crackers).\n\nIn Indonesia, the soft peeled boneless chicken feet are a popular choice for baby food — given to babies between 6–12 months old. It often served as \"nasi tim\": steamed rice with boneless chicken feet, mashed liver and vegetable broth. Chicken feet which consists of tendons, skin and cartilage, is rich in gelatinous collagen, and is traditionally believed to be beneficial for infants' skin, nails, joints and bone development.\n\nIn Jamaican cuisine, chicken feet are mainly used to make chicken foot soup. The soup contains yams, potatoes, green/yellow banana, dumplings and special spices in addition to the chicken feet, and is slow cooked for a minimum of two hours. Chicken feet are also curried or stewed and served as a main part of a meal.\n\nIn Korea, chicken feet are known as \"dakbal\" (), and grilled or stir-fried with hot chili sauce. They are often eaten as \"anju\" (food served with alcohol).\n\nChicken feet are commonly used as a main or supplementary ingredient in chicken soup.\n\nChicken feet are also known as \"ceker\" in Malaysia and are traditionally popular mostly among Malays of Javanese, Chinese and Siamese descent. Many traditional Malay restaurants in the state of Johor offer chicken feet that are cooked together with Malay-style curry and eaten with roti canai. In the state of Selangor, chicken feet are either boiled in soup until the bones are soft with vegetables and spices or deep fried in palm oil. Chicken feet are also eaten by Malaysian Chinese in traditional Chinese cooking style.\n\nChicken feet are a popular ingredient across Mexico, particularly in stews and soups. They are often steamed to become part of a main dish with rice, vegetables and most likely another part of the chicken, such as the breast or thighs. The feet can be seasoned with mole sauce. On occasion, they are breaded and fried.\n\nMany people will also take the chicken feet in hand as a snack and chew the soft outer skin. The inner bone structure is left uneaten.\n\nIn the Philippines, chicken feet are marinated in a mixture of calamansi, spices and brown sugar before being grilled. A popular staple in Philippine street food, chicken feet are commonly known as \"adidas\" (named after the athletic shoe brand Adidas).Chicken feet is also an ingredient in Philippine adobo.\n\nIn South Africa, chicken feet are mainly eaten in townships in all nine provinces, where they are known as \"walkie talkies\" (together with the head, intestine, hearts and giblets), \"runaways\" and \"chicken dust\". The feet are submerged in hot water, so the outer layer of the skin can be removed by peeling it off, and then covered in seasonings and grilled. The name \"chicken dust\" derives from the dust chickens create when scratching the ground with their feet.They are often eaten as snack.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, the chicken feet are served in a variety of dishes, such as in a version of chicken green curry.\n\nIn Trinidad, the chicken feet are cleaned, seasoned, boiled in seasoned water, and left to soak with cucumbers, onions, peppers and green seasoning until cool. It is eaten as a party dish called chicken foot souse.\n\n"}
{"id": "3829401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3829401", "title": "Cynefin framework", "text": "Cynefin framework\n\nThe Cynefin framework ( ) is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making. Created in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services, it has been described as a \"sense-making device\". \"Cynefin\" is a Welsh word for \"habitat\".\n\nCynefin offers five decision-making contexts or \"domains\"—\"obvious\" (known until 2014 as \"simple\"), \"complicated\", \"complex\", \"chaotic\", and \"disorder\"—that help managers to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour. The framework draws on research into systems theory, complexity theory, network theory and learning theories. \n\nThe idea of the Cynefin framework is that it offers decision-makers a \"sense of place\" from which to view their perceptions. \"Cynefin\" is a Welsh word meaning \"habitat\", \"haunt\", \"acquainted\", \"familiar\". Snowden uses the term to refer to the idea that we all have connections, such as tribal, religious and geographical, of which we may not be aware. It has been compared to the Maori word \"turangawaewae\", meaning a place to stand. \n\nSnowden, then of IBM Global Services, began work on a Cynefin model in 1999 to help manage intellectual capital within the company. He continued developing it as European director of IBM's Institute of Knowledge Management, and later as founder and director of the IBM Cynefin Centre for Organizational Complexity, established in 2002. Snowden and Cynthia Kurtz, an IBM researcher, described the framework in detail the following year in a paper, \"The new dynamics of strategy: Sense-making in a complex and complicated world\", published in \"IBM Systems Journal\".\n\nThe Cynefin Centre—a network of members and partners from industry, government and academia—began operating independently of IBM in 2004. In 2007 Snowden and Mary E. Boone described the Cynefin framework in the \"Harvard Business Review\". Their paper, \"A Leader's Framework for Decision Making\", won them an \"Outstanding Practitioner-Oriented Publication in OB\" award from the Academy of Management's Organizational Behavior division.\n\nCynefin offers four decision-making contexts or \"domains\": \"simple, complicated, complex, chaotic\", and a centre of \"disorder\". The domain names have changed over the years. Kurtz and Snowden (2003) called them \"known, knowable, complex, and chaotic\". Snowden and Boone (2007) changed \"known\" and \"knowable\" to \"simple\" and \"complicated\". Since 2014 Snowden has used \"obvious\" in place of \"simple\".\n\nThe domains offer a \"sense of place\" from which to analyse behaviour and make decisions. The domains on the right, \"simple\"/\"obvious\" and \"complicated\", are \"ordered\": cause and effect are known or can be discovered. The domains on the left, \"complex\" and \"chaotic\", are \"unordered\": cause and effect can be deduced only with hindsight or not at all.\n\nThe \"simple\"/\"obvious\" domain represents the \"known knowns\". This means that there are rules in place (or best practice), the situation is stable, and the relationship between cause and effect is clear: if you do X, expect Y. The advice in such a situation is to \"sense–categorize–respond\": establish the facts (\"sense\"), categorize, then respond by following the rule or applying best practice. Snowden and Boone (2007) offer the example of loan-payment processing. An employee identifies the problem (for example, a borrower has paid less than required), categorizes it (reviews the loan documents), and responds (follows the terms of the loan). According to Thomas A. Stewart,\n\nThis is the domain of legal structures, standard operating procedures, practices that are proven to work. Never draw to an inside straight. Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income. Never end the meeting without asking for the sale. Here, decision-making lies squarely in the realm of reason: Find the proper rule and apply it.\n\nSnowden and Boone write that managers should beware of forcing situations into this domain by over-simplifying, by \"entrained thinking\" (being blind to new ways of thinking), or by becoming complacent. When success breeds complacency (\"best practice is, by definition, past practice\"), there can be a catastrophic clockwise shift into the chaotic domain. They recommend that leaders provide a communication channel, if necessary an anonymous one, so that dissenters (for example, within a workforce) can warn about complacency.\n\nThe \"complicated\" domain consists of the \"known unknowns\". The relationship between cause and effect requires analysis or expertise; there are a range of right answers. The framework recommends \"sense–analyze–respond\": assess the facts, analyze, and apply the appropriate good operating practice. According to Stewart: \"Here it is possible to work rationally toward a decision, but doing so requires refined judgment and expertise. ... This is the province of engineers, surgeons, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and other experts. Artificial intelligence copes well here: Deep Blue plays chess as if it were a complicated problem, looking at every possible sequence of moves.\"\n\nThe \"complex\" domain represents the \"unknown unknowns\". Cause and effect can only be deduced in retrospect, and there are no right answers. \"Instructive patterns ... can emerge,\" write Snowden and Boone, \"if the leader conducts experiments that are safe to fail.\" Cynefin calls this process \"probe–sense–respond\". Hard insurance cases are one example. \"Hard cases ... need human underwriters,\" Stewart writes, \"and the best all do the same thing: Dump the file and spread out the contents.\" Stewart identifies battlefields, markets, ecosystems and corporate cultures as complex systems that are \"impervious to a reductionist, take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works approach, because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways.\"\n\nIn the \"chaotic\" domain, cause and effect are unclear. Events in this domain are \"too confusing to wait for a knowledge-based response\", writes Patrick Lambe. \"Action—\"any\" action—is the first and only way to respond appropriately.\" In this context, managers \"act–sense–respond\": \"act\" to establish order; \"sense\" where stability lies; \"respond\" to turn the chaotic into the complex. Snowden and Boone write:\n\nIn the chaotic domain, a leader’s immediate job is not to discover patterns but to staunch the bleeding. A leader must first act to establish order, then sense where stability is present and from where it is absent, and then respond by working to transform the situation from chaos to complexity, where the identification of emerging patterns can both help prevent future crises and discern new opportunities. Communication of the most direct top-down or broadcast kind is imperative; there’s simply no time to ask for input.\n\nThe September 11 attacks were an example of the \"chaotic\" category. Stewart offers others: \"the firefighter whose gut makes him turn left or the trader who instinctively sells when the news about the stock seems too good to be true.\" One crisis executive said of the collapse of Enron: \"People were afraid. ... Decision-making was paralyzed. ... You've got to be quick and decisive—make little steps you know will succeed, so you can begin to tell a story that makes sense.\" \n\nSnowden and Boone give the example of the 1993 Brown's Chicken massacre in Palatine, Illinois—when robbers murdered seven employees in Brown's Chicken and Pasta restaurant—as a situation in which local police faced all the domains. Deputy Police Chief Walt Gasior had to act immediately to stem the early panic (\"chaotic\"), while keeping the department running (\"simple\"), calling in experts (\"complicated\"), and maintaining community confidence in the following weeks (\"complex\").\n\nThe dark \"disorder\" domain in the centre represents situations where there is no clarity about which of the other domains apply. By definition it is hard to see when this domain applies. \"Here, multiple perspectives jostle for prominence, factional leaders argue with one another, and cacophony rules\", write Snowden and Boone. \"The way out of this realm is to break down the situation into constituent parts and assign each to one of the other four realms. Leaders can then make decisions and intervene in contextually appropriate ways.\"\n\nAs knowledge increases, there is a \"clockwise drift\" from \"chaotic\" through \"complex\" and \"complicated\" to \"simple\". Similarly, a \"buildup of biases\", complacency or lack of maintenance can cause a \"catastrophic failure\": a clockwise movement from \"simple\" to \"chaotic\", represented by the \"fold\" between those domains. There can be counter-clockwise movement as people die and knowledge is forgotten, or as new generations question the rules; and a counter-clockwise push from \"chaotic\" to \"simple\" can occur when a lack of order causes rules to be imposed suddenly.\n\nCynefin was used by its IBM developers in policy-making, product development, market creation, supply chain management, branding and customer relations. Later uses include analysing the impact of religion on policymaking within the George W. Bush administration, emergency management, network science and the military, the management of food-chain risks, homeland security in the United States, agile software development, and policing the Occupy Movement in the United States.\n\nIt has also been used in health-care research, including to examine the complexity of care in the British National Health Service, the nature of knowledge in health care, and the fight against HIV/AIDs in South Africa. In 2017 the RAND Corporation used the Cynefin framework in a discussion of theories and models of decision making. \n\nCriticism of Cynefin includes that the framework is difficult and confusing, needs a more rigorous foundation, and covers too limited a selection of possible contexts. Another criticism is that terms such as \"known, knowable, sense,\" and \"categorize\" are ambiguous.\n"}

It is typically made of mangoes, vinegar, salt, mustard, turmeric, chili and fenugreek, similarly to savoury mango chutneys.\n\nMangoes being native to South Asia, the name \"amba\" seems to have been borrowed, via Arabic, from the Marathi word \"āmbā\" (आंबा), which is in turn derived from the Sanskrit word \"āmra\" (आम्र, \"mango\").\nAccording to the urban legend, amba was developed in the 19th century by members of the Sassoon family of Bombay, Iraqi Jews originally from Baghdad.Iraqi Jewish immigrants brought it to Israel in the 1950s as an accompaniment to their Shabbat morning meal. \nAmba is frequently used in Iraqi cuisine, especially as a spicy sauce to be added to fish dishes, falafel, kubbah, kebabs, and eggs.\n\nAmba is popular in the Arabian Peninsula, sold in sealed jars or by kilo.

It is often served as a dressing on sabikh and as an optional topping on falafel, meorav yerushalmi, kebab, salads and shawarma sandwiches.\n\nAmba is also used in Assyrian cuisine, especially with falafel.\n\nAmba is similar to the South Asian pickle \"achar\". Some differences are that amba tends to be sweet, often with large pieces of mango rather than small cubes, and that achar also contains oil.\n\nAmba is also mentioned in literary works, mainly memoirs. In his memoir \"Baghdad Yesterday\" Sasson Somekh dedicates a whole chapter to amba. He uses amba to tell the story of the Iraqi Jewish community that had satellite communities in India and Southeast Asia. In the same chapter Somekh references another Iraqi, who wrote a short story about amba (Abd al-Malik Noori, \"It happened on a Friday\").\n\nKhalid Qisthini, a columnist at Asharq al-Awsat, wrote a short article on remembering the foods of Baghdad of the past. His article is titled “Talking about the food of amba and samoon, which characterised Baghdad of the past.\" He remembers that in his youth, school children would rush out of school to get samoon with amba from the street vendor, who, if generous, would add a little more amba.\n\n"}

As of 2013, Activia is present in more than 70 countries and on 5 continents. Activia is classified as a functional food, designed to improve digestive health.\n\nIn the 1980s, Danone researchers took interest in bifidobacteria. They developed a specific strain that can survive in the acidic medium of yogurt. In addition to traditional yogurt bacteria, they decided to add a probiotic strain:Bifidus Actiregularis. Activia products thus contain \"Bifidobacterium animalis DN 173,010\", a proprietary strain of Bifidobacterium, a probiotic which is marketed by Dannon under the trade names \"Bifidus Regularis\", \"Bifidus Actiregularis\", \"Bifidus Digestivum\" and \"Bifidobacterium Lactis\". Danone launched Activia in France in 1987 under the \"Bio\" brand name.\n\nIn the 1980s, Danone researchers took interest in bifidobacteria.

In 2013, it was sold in more than 70 countries.\n\nActivia products are sold with different textures (set or firm, stirred, drinkable ... ) and in flavors adapted to local consumer preferences. The product line varies by country. Most Activia yogurts contain real fruit.\n\n\n\nIn Brazil, both yogurt and yogurt-drinks are available. In addition to the usual worldwide fruit flavors, honey with carrot is also available. The \"light\" line is marketed as \"0%\" fat.\n\nIn Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania the products include semi-solid yogurts (plain, cereal, strawberry, peach and prune) and yogurt drinks (plain, cereal, strawberry-kiwi and cherry-vanilla).\n\nIn Finland the Activia brand includes fruit and natural yogurt as well as yogurt drinks. Lactose free forms of the yogurt are also sold.\n\nIn France, semi-solid yogurt and yogurt with fruit layers are available. Unique flavors include coconut. The \"light\" series is marketed as \"0%\" fat.\n\nIn Spain there are over 56 different flavors. Following a European law which forbids non-organic food to be labeled \"Bio\", Danone changed Spanish \"Bio\"-branded products to the \"Activia\" brand in order to comply with the law.\n\nIn Russia, the products include yogurt, yogurt drinks and kefir, a drink traditionally popular in Commonwealth of Independent States countries. The fiber yogurt series includes three muesli flavors in addition to the oat cereal flavor found in the US and UK. Drinkable yogurt variations include pineapple and dried apricot, among others.\n\nIn Britain and Republic of Ireland, the Activia range includes : \n\nIn the Republic of South Africa, flavors include pear, mango, dried apricot, kiwi, fiber and prune.\n\n\nWith its launch in France in the 1980s, Activia pioneered the probiotic spoonable yogurt market.\n\nIn 2006, Activia sales reached $130 million, in the US alone. The following year, sales increased by 50% in the US market.\n\nIn 2009, sales of Activia reach €2.6 billion globally, with key markets in Europe and the United States. Activia's popularity in the United States is due to the growing public demand for natural products as well as the growing market of probiotics that came into vogue in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2010, Activia dominated the probiotic dairy sector.\nThe success of Activia has increased the health yogurt market.\n\nActivia, Actimel and Danonino account for more than half of the total worldwide yogurt sales. Activia is a more than 2 billion-dollar brand which owes its success to the health benefit claim.\n\nIn 2011, Activia is the largest global fresh dairy brand in the world (Nielsen data). The probiotic yogurt market is valued at €4 billion.\n\nActivia is present in more than 70 countries and is one of the major brands of the Danone Group.\n\nActivia products are considered as functional foods. These foods are enriched with probiotics and provide health benefits when consumed in\nadequate amounts. The positive effects depend on the specific strain, and its dose.\n\nIn 2003, the probiotics (also called functional foods) market was worth $9.9 billion. These products are also heavily marketed and more expensive than non-probiotic dairy products.\n\nIn 2009, in United Kingdom, 60% of households regularly bought probiotic drinks. The market there is currently worth £164m per year.\n\nConsumers are willing to pay for products that provide health benefits. Activia products, that are considered as functional foods, are priced about two dollars higher than other yogurts.\n\nSince Activia's launch, the Danone Group focused Activia communication on probiotics and health benefits. The WHO defines probiotics as \"\"live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\"\". Consumers bought Activia products mostly for its medicinal qualities.\n\nIn 2010, Dannon partnered with actress Jamie Lee Curtis to promote Activia products. On the screen, the audience could read \"scientifically proven\" to reduce irregularity. According to the brand, Activia \"\"helps regulate your digestive system\"\" when eaten on a daily basis. Danone used health claims as a marketing tool.\n\nBut Danone has been accused of deceptive advertising.\n\nFurther the US litigation and the EU health claims law, and just before the decision of the EFSA on Activia, Danone thus decided to change Activia communication and marketing. Advertising does not talk about health benefits any more, but about pleasure and taste. On Danone's website, one can read : \"\"Drinking and eating are, first and foremost, a source of pleasure, and while the initial purchase of a product may be motivated by a health benefit, in the majority of cases, a repeat purchase is motivated by the taste\"\".\n\nSome experts say that there is evidence that probiotic strains reduce diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and duration of colds. But others argue that their benefits are not certain.\n\nThe US FDA pressed charges for false advertising.\n\nAccording to Danone, Activia is based on 17 scientific studies. But according to CBS News, two of these studies were not statistically significant compared to the placebo groups and six others didn't show a statistically significant improvement in transit time.\n\nIn 2006, a European regulation demanded that health food companies come up with the scientific evidence to back their labeling and advertising. Member states were asked to submit health claims from manufacturers who had to wait for the approval of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA currently verifies all functional foods claims. Most of the time, EFSA rejects companies' claims due to the lack of scientific evidence.\n\nIn 2010, following a stream of negative opinions from EFSA for other health claims, Dannon decided to withdraw claims on Activia.\n\nIn its marketing for Activia, Danone claimed that \"Bifidobacterium animalis\" relieves irregularity.\n\nIn the 2010 Activia TV commercials, a voiceover explains : \"\"Activia eaten every day is clinically proven to help regulate your digestive system in two weeks\"\". Danone said it had scientific evidence to back up its assertions.\n\nBut according to the Federal Trade Commission, commercials and claims on Activia packages are deceptive and Danone exaggerates the yogurt's health benefits. In its 2010 charges against Danone, the FTC stated that \"\"Eating one serving of Activia daily is not clinically proven to relieve temporary irregularity and help with slow intestinal transit time\"\". In fact, consumers must eat three servings of Activia each day to obtain health benefits.\n\nIn December 2010, The Danone Company settled allegations of false advertising. In the settlement, Danone dropped its claims of the health benefits of its Activia yogurt. The company thus agreed to stop advertising that Activia yogurt improves motility, unless the ad conveys that three servings must be eaten per day to obtain these benefits. \nDanone therefore removed the words \"clinically\" and \"scientifically proven\" from Activia products.\n\nDanone agreed to pay 21 million to 39 states that had coordinated investigations with the FTC. In response to a similar lawsuit in Canada, Danone agreed to settle the suit by paying compensation and modifying its advertising.\n\nA class action lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court on 25 January 2008, argued that Danone's own studies failed to support its advertised claims. The class action suit accused Danone of mounting a massive false advertising campaign to convince consumers to buy Activia products because of their health benefits.\n\nIn a statement in response to the lawsuit, Danone stated that it \"\"strongly disagrees with the allegations in the lawsuit\"\" and that it makes all scientific studies about its products available to the public, following the established method of peer-review and publication. According to the group:\"\"All of Dannon's claims for Activia and DanActive are completely supported by peer-reviewed science and are in accordance with all laws and regulations\"\".\n\nIn 2009, as a part of the settlement, Danone agreed to create a $35 million fund to reimburse unsatisfied consumers who had bought its Activia and DanActive yogurts.\n\nDanone spokespeople deny the claims of the lawsuit and admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which was agreed to in order to \"avoid the distraction and expense of litigation.\" , this fund has only paid out about US$1 million in reimbursements to consumers.\n\nIn October 2009, Danone was sued in Quebec Superior Court over the nature of the health claims in its advertising. The company had asserted that Activia yogurt could improve digestion or prevent the common cold. In September 2012, the parties elected to settle the case; Danone agreed to modify its advertising claims, but was not forced to admit wrongdoing. Consumers who purchased Activia yogurt between 1 April 2009 and 6 Nov 2012 had 90 days to request compensation between C$15 to C$50, based on the quantity purchased.\n\n"}

Several varieties of chili sauce include sugar in their preparation, such as sweet chili sauce and Thai sweet chili sauce, which adds sweetness to their flavor profile. Sometimes, chili sauces are prepared with red tomato as primary ingredients. Chili sauce may have a thicker texture and viscosity when compared to that of hot sauces. \n\nChili paste usually refers to a paste where the main ingredient is chili pepper. Some are used as a cooking ingredient, while others are used to season a dish after preparation. Some are fermented with beans, as in Chinese doubanjiang, and some are prepared with powdered fermented beans, as in Korean gochujang. There are different regional varieties of chili paste and also within the same cuisine.\n\nChili sauces and pastes can be used as a dipping sauce, cooking glaze and marinade. Many commercial varieties of mass-produced chili sauce and paste exist.\n\nIngredients typically include puréed or chopped chili peppers, vinegar, sugar and salt that are cooked, which thickens the mixture. Additional ingredients may include, water, garlic, other foodstuffs, corn syrup, spices and seasonings. Some varieties use ripe red puréed tomato as the primary ingredient.\n\nChinese chili sauces usually come as a thick paste, and are used either as a dipping sauce or in stir frying.\n\n\"Dou ban\" sauce (\"là dòubànjiàng\" 辣豆瓣醬, \"là dòu jiàng\" là dòujiàng, \"dòubànjiàng\" 豆瓣醬), (\"là\" is \"spice\", \"dou\" is \"bean\", \"bàn\" is \"piece\", and \"jiàng\" is \"sauce\") originates from Szechuan cuisine in which chilis are used liberally. It is made from broad bean or soybean paste, and usually contain a fair amount of chili. Often referred to in English as chili bean sauce. \"Pao la jiao\" or \"yu la jiao\" (泡辣, 魚辣椒), dipped chili or fish chili, is made by pickling whole, fresh red chilis in a brine solution; this sauce is the key ingredient in the famous Sichuan dish Yúxiāng ròusī (魚香肉絲), julienned pork in fish fragrance sauce. The key to this pickle is to add a live crucian carp to the pickling pot along with the chilis, hence the name fish chili. The carp is supposed to lend its fragrance and \"umami\" to the pickle.\n\nChili oil, Làjiāoyóu or hóngyóu (辣椒油, 紅油), is another distinctive Sichuan flavoring found mainly in cold dishes, as well as a few hot dishes. Chili oil or Lahtt Sauce is made by pouring hot oil onto a bowl of dried chilies, to which some Sichuan pepper is usually added. After steeping in hot oil for at least a few hours, the oil takes on the taste and fragrance of chili. The finer the chili is ground, the stronger the flavor (regional preferences vary - ground chili is usually used in western China, while whole dried chili is more common in northern China.)\n\nGuilin (Kweilin) chili sauce (\"Guìlín làjiāojiàng\" 桂林辣椒醬) is made of fresh chili, garlic and fermented soybeans; it also is marketed as soy chili sauce (la jiao jiang and la dou ban jiang are not the same thing, though they look vaguely similar in the jar). Duò jiāo sauce (duò jiāo 剁椒) originates from Hunan cuisine, which is reputed to be even spicier than Sichuan cuisine. \"Duo\" means chopped, and \"jiao\" means chili. \"Duo jiao\" is made of chopped red chilis pickled in a brine solution, and has a salty and sour pickled taste; it is the key flavoring in the signature Hunan dish \"duòjiāo yútóu\" (剁椒魚頭), fish head steamed with chopped chili.\n\nXO sauce (XO醬) is spicy seafood sauce from Hong Kong. It is commonly used in southern Chinese regions like Guangdong province.\n\nRāyu or La Yu chili oil (辣油, Chinese 辣椒油), is the same as \"la jiao you\", and is often used for dishes such as \"gyoza\". Shichimi tōgarashi (七味唐辛子) is a seven in one ingredient spicy seasoning mixes, with chili, used for many soups and foods, such as udon. Ichimi tōgarashi (一味唐辛子) is cayenne pepper powder. Okinawa - Kōrēgūsu (コーレーグース, 高麗胡椒), made of chilis infused in awamori rice spirit, is a popular condiment to Okinawan dishes such as Okinawa soba. It refers to Goguryeo.\n\n\nGochujang (고추장), or red chili paste, is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented condiment made with chili powder, glutinous rice flour, \"meju\" (fermented soybean) powder, barley malt powder, and salt. The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process. Traditionally, it has been naturally fermented over years in \"jangdok\" (earthenware) on an elevated stone platform, called \"jangdokdae\", in the backyard.\n\n\nSambal is a generic term for many varieties of chili-based sauces popular in Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Most of sambals are traditionally made using stone pestle and mortar, according to each recipe. Nevertheless, there are some bottled mass-produced sambal brands today. \"Saus Cabai\" (Indonesia) or \"Sos Cili\" (Malaysia), a category of its own, uses tomato puree, chili juice, sugar, salt and some other spices or seasonings to give the spicy, but not too hot, taste. Some countryside commercial varieties use bird's eye chili (\"cili padi\", \"cabai rawit\" or \"burung\") together with its seeds to raise the level of heat (piquancy) of the sauce. Variants include the typical concoctions with ginger and garlic (for chicken rice) and variants that are made into gummy consistency as with ketchup/tomato sauce.\n\nIn Indonesia, the bottled commercially available chili sauce is known as bottled \"saus cabai\". They are also commonly known as bottled \"sambal\". However, unlike the coarse textured and richly flavored traditional \"sambal\", this bottled \"sambal\" or chili sauce has an even gloppy texture similar to those of tomato sauce, and rather simple hot flavor. Unlike traditional \"sambal\", enrichened with shrimp paste, the commercial sambal sauce usually uses finely blended red chili pepper and garlic, and sometimes a little bit of sugar, without any addition of shrimp paste.\n\nThais put raw chilies on a very wide variety of food, in lieu of chili sauces. Chili sauces are eaten as condiments but they can also be used as an ingredient.\n\n\"Nam phrik\" is the generic name for a Thai chili dip or paste. A Thai cookbook from 1974 lists over 100 different recipes. \"Nam phrik phao\" (roasted chili paste), \"nam phrik num\" (pounded grilled green chili paste) and \"nam phrik kapi\" (chili paste made with fermented shrimp paste) are some of the more well-known varieties. Many Thai dipping sauces (\"nam chim\") contain chili peppers. \"Nam chim chaeo\" uses ground dried chili peppers to achieve its spiciness. Available worldwide is \"nam chim kai\", also known as \"chili sauce for chicken\" or \"Thai sweet chili sauce\". \"Phrik nam pla\" is fish sauce (\"nam pla\") with chopped raw chilies, lime juice and sometimes garlic. Sriracha sauce is a Thai chili sauce, originally from the town of Si Racha, Thailand.\n\nSriracha sauce is a type of hot sauce or chili sauce made from a paste of chili peppers, distilled vinegar, garlic, sugar, and salt. It is named after the coastal city of Si Racha, in the Chonburi Province of Eastern Thailand, where it was possibly first produced for dishes served at local seafood restaurants.\n\nA type of chili sauce is Thai sweet chili sauce, which is used as a dipping sauce, a marinade, and for cooking, such as in stir fried dishes. The company Mae Ploy is a major manufacturer of Thai sweet chili sauce. Most major supermarket chain stores in North America carry Thai sweet chili sauce. Sweet chili sauce is used in Thai cuisine, and is also sometimes used in the preparation of sushi. \n\nSome versions of \"Nam phrik\", a range of chili-based, hot sauces typical of Thai cuisine, are sweetened with sugar.\n\nVietnamese hot sauce is made from sun-ripened chili peppers, vinegar, garlic, sugar and salt. It is very popular in Vietnamese cuisine, often used in a wide variety of foods.\n\nChili (Hindi: mirch), fresh, semi-dried or dried, is a crucial ingredient throughout South Asia, with multiple strains having arrived through Portuguese trade from the sixteenth century. Many varieties are now popular in different parts of the sub-continent such as Naga Chilli from Nagaland, Chamba Chukh from Himachal Pradesh, Guntur Chilli from Andhra Pradesh, Jwala Chilli from Gujarat among others. Hot sauces proper, however, were not common until recent decades, as varieties such as bhut jolokia and naga morich attained global fame.\n\n\nShatta (Arabic: شطة \"shaṭṭah\") is a popular hot sauce made from wholly grounded fresh chili peppers by mixing them with oil (usually olive). Vinegar, garlic, or other spices are commonly added. There are two varieties of Shatta: green and red. The red variety is made with tomatoes. It is made from piri piri, or similarly hot peppers. The degree of hotness varies according to the type of chili used and preference of the maker (homemade Shatta is usually hotter than commercial brands). Commonly used in falafel sandwiches, hummus dishes, or as a condiment. Muhammara ( \"muḥammarah\") is a hot pepper dip made from Aleppo pepper, ground walnuts, dried bread, and olive oil. Other spices and flavorings may be added. It is served as a dip or spread for bread or as a sauce for fish and meat. The dish is also known in Turkey, where it may be called \"acuka\".\n\nHarissa (Arabic: هريسة \"harīsah\") is a popular hot sauce used in Tunisia and elsewhere in the Maghreb (especially Algeria and Libya). It is usually made from ground red birdseye chili peppers with olive oil, garlic, cumin and coriander although caraway is sometimes used instead of cumin and recipes vary. The sauce is of a dark red grainy texture. It is sometimes spread on bread rolls but also used as a condiment with a variety of meals. Tunisian Harissa is much hotter than that found in neighboring countries. Cap Bon is a popular brand of Harissa. Harissa is often sold in tin cans. Harissa is also popular in Israel, on account of immigration of Maghrebi Jews.\n\n\nSahawiq ( \"saḥawaq\") is produced by grinding fresh peppers with garlic, coriander, and sometimes other ingredients. It is popular both in Yemen and in Israel, where it was brought by Yemenite Jews, and where it is called סחוג \"s'khug\".\n\n\"Erős Pista\" (lit. \"Strong Steve\") and \"Piros Arany\" (lit. \"Red Gold\") hot pepper paste, both made from minced hot paprika (Capsicum annuum L.); paprika is commonly grown in Hungary and both hot and mild paprika are in common usage there.\n\n\n"}

However, devotees have had good results by following the instructions for a malted fruit loaf but without the fruit or alcohol.\n\nAlthough a sweet bread, Veda is often eaten toasted with butter and cheese, although many prefer to add jam or marmalade.

It is commonly found in Southeast Asia and is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma. Next to the green jelly, additional toppings might be added, including diced jackfruit, sweetened red azuki beans, or durian.\n\nThe word \"cendol\" was first mentioned in 1932 as one of the foodstuffs available in Kuala Lumpur as recorded in the Malay Concordance Project that collects Malay writings. Dawet is claimed to be the origin of cendol; the Javanese name of \"dawet\" was recorded in early 19th century Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini, composed between 1814-1823 in Surakarta, Central Java. In Java, \"dawet\" refer to the whole concoction of \"cendol\" green jellies, usually made from \"aren\" sagoo or rice flour, coconut milk and liquid \"gula jawa\" (palm sugar syrup), sometimes sliced jackfruit might be added.\n\nThere is a popular belief that the name \"cendol\" is related to, or originated from, the word \"jendol\", in reference to the swollen green worm-like rice flour jelly; in Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian, and Malay, \"jendol\" means \"bump,\" \"bulge,\" or \"swollen.\" In most parts of Indonesia, \"cendol\" refer to the green rice flour jelly; while the concoction of that green rice flour jellies with coconut milk, shaved ice, areca palm sugar and sometimes diced jackfruit is called \"es cendol\" or \"dawet\" (in Central and East Java).\n\nIndonesian dictionary describes \"cendol\" as a snack made from rice flour and other ingredients that are formed by filters, then mixed with palm sugar and coconut milk (for beverage). The Malay dictionary \"Kamus Dewan\" similarly defines it as a porridge-like drink with long strands made of rice flour in coconut milk and sugar syrup.\n\nIn Vietnam, this worm-like rice flour concoction is called \"bánh lọt\" or \"fall through cake\". \"Bánh lọt\" is a common ingredient in a Vietnamese dessert drink called \"chè\", or more commonly \"chè ba màu\". In Thailand it is called \"lot chong\" (, ) which can be translated as \"gone through a hole\", indicating the way it is made by pressing the warm dough through a sieve into a container of cold water. In Burma, it is known as \"mont let saung\" or . In Cambodia, it is known as \"lot\" (លត /lɔːt/), \"bang-aem lot\" (បង្អែមលត /bɑŋʔaɛm lɔːt/), \"nom lot\" (នំលត /nɷm lɔːt/), and \"banh lot\" (បាញ់លត /baɲ lɔːt/).\n\nThe origin of cendol is not clear, and this sweet drink is widely spread across Southeast Asia. However, one suggestion is that cendol originated in Java, Indonesia as \"dawet\". The oldest record mentioned about \"dawet\" sweet drink is the Kresnayana manuscript, dated from Kediri Kingdom circa 12th century Java. Historian suggest that the use of sagoo or rice flour as sweet beverage ingredient might occurred early in the rice agriculture society of ancient Java. Indeed, cendol jellies and its variations are rural agricultural product, still traditionally produced in Javanese villages. In Banjarnegara, Central Java, \"dawet\" is traditionally served without ice. Today, however additional ice cubes or shaved ice is commonly added into this dessert drink. This might suggest that in tropical Java, \"dawet\" is a traditional sweet dessert drink that predates the adoption of refrigeration technology, as early as 12th century.\n\nCendol is typically served with ice, and developed when ice became readily available. It may have originated in Malayan port cities such as Malacca and Penang where British refrigerated ships' technology would provide the required ice.\n\nIn Javanese tradition, dawet or cendol is a part of traditional Javanese wedding ceremony. The \"dodol dawet\" (Javanese for \"selling dawet\") is performed during Midodareni ceremony, a day before the wedding. After the \"siraman\" bridal shower, the parents would sell dawet to the attending guests and relatives. The guest paid the dawet using terracotta coins that would be given to the bride as a symbol of family earnings. The symbolic meaning was as the parents' hope that the tomorrow wedding would be attended by a lot of guests, \"as plenty as the cendol jellies that being sold.\" In Dutch East Indies Java, dawet street hawkers using \"pikulan\" (baskets carried with balancing rod) are commonly found in Javanese cities, as can be seen in the old photograph dated from circa 1935.\n\nCendol has been declared a Malaysian heritage food by the Malaysian Department of National Heritage.\n\nThe ingredients of cendol relies heavily on \"aren\" (sugar palm) and coconut plants. The dessert's original or basic ingredients are coconut milk, jelly noodles made from rice flour with green food coloring (usually derived from the pandan leaf), shaved ice, and palm sugar. The cendol in Indonesia is usually served in a tall glass, assembled with liquid \"gula jawa\" or palm sugar syrup in the bottom, followed by green jellies, poured with coconut milk, and topped with shaved ice.\n\nThe Singaporean and Malaysian versions usually have sweetened red beans added, and are served in a bowl instead of a glass. The palm sugar, often added as a dark syrup, is referred to as \"gula melaka\".\n\nIn Sunda, Indonesia, cendol is a dark-green pulpy dish of rice (or sago) flour worms with coconut milk and syrup of areca sugar. In Javanese, \"cendol\" refers to the green jelly-like part of the beverage, while the combination of \"cendol\", palm sugar and coconut milk is called \"dawet\". Today, the green \"cendol\" jelly noodles are mainly made from rice flour, since rice is more readily available. However, in Java, a traditional \"cendol\" worm-like jelly noodles was made from \"sagu aren\", or sago starch extracted from the trunk of sugar palm (\"Arenga pinnata\").\n\nIn Indonesia, additional ingredients might include tapai (fermented sweet cassava), black grass jelly, and sweetened condensed milk. In Indonesia and Thailand, cendol usually served in tall glass, in Malaysia and Singapore however, they usually served in a bowl.\n\nIn Myanmar, \"mont let saung\" has 2 primary forms, \"htannyet mont let saung\" (ထန်းလျက်မုန့်လက်ဆောင်း), which is served in a caramel-colored jaggery syrup, and \"onno mont let saung\" (အုန်းနို့မုန့်လက်ဆောင်း), which is served with coconut milk. The snack is an iconic snack during Thingyan (Burmese New Year), where it is commonly served by \"satuditha\" donors to revelers. Vietnamese \"chè ba màu\" adds white black-eyed peas and red azuki beans together with green jellies. Thai \"lot chong\" is closer to the Javanese original, only consisting of green worm-like jellies, coconut milk, liquid palm sugar, and shaved ice.\n\nIn Indonesia, the most famous variant is Javanese \"es dawet ayu\" from Banjarnegara, Central Java. Another variant is a black cendol called \"es dawet ireng\" from Purworejo, Central Java. \"Ireng\" is Javanese word for \"black\". Instead of green pandan leaf, this black cendol acquired its color from \"merang\" or the ash of burned rice stalk mixed with water.\n\nOther than basic ingredients of green jelly noodles, palm sugar syrup, and coconut milk; iced cendol might be served with additional toppings. Additional topping includes diced jackfruit, tapai (fermented sweet cassava), durian flesh, and chocolate condensed milk are popular in Indonesia. While in Malaysia, additional topping such as red beans, glutinous rice, grass jelly, creamed corn, durian, glutinous rice tapai and even ice cream might also be included.\n\nThe influence of Singapore and the West has given rise to different variations of cendol, such as cendol with vanilla ice-cream or topped with durian.\n\nCendol has become a quintessential part of cuisine in Southeast Asia and is often sold by vendors at roadsides, hawker centres, and food courts. \"Cendol\" vendors are almost ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, especially Jakarta, Bandung, and Yogyakarta. Originally \"cendol\" or \"dawet\" in Java was served without ice, but after the introduction of refrigeration technology, the cold \"cendol\" with shaved ice (\"es serut\") was available and widely popular.\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, \"cendol\" is commonly sold on the roadside by vendors. It is even dessert fare in Singapore, found in dessert stalls, food centres, coffee shops, and food courts.\n\nIn colloquial Indonesian, the term \"cendol\" has become an online rating system. If an online items tweaks interest, a user punch in one or more green commas resembling a cendol.\n\nCendol is also one of the Indonesian food items made popular by Barack Obama during his Indonesian visit in 2017. Obama stated that during his visit he had a lot of Indonesian food including satay, bakso, tempeh, and nasi goreng, but he missed es cendol and es kelapa muda, thus he determined to have them in his last afternoon in Indonesia.\n\nIn December 2018, \"cendol\" became embroiled in a controversy after CNN listed the Singapore version as one of world's top 50 desserts triggering a furious response from Malaysians.\n\n"}

Examples are \"cat\", \"traffic light\", \"take care of\", \"by the way\", and \"it's raining cats and dogs\". Lexical items can be generally understood to convey a single meaning, much as a lexeme, but are not limited to single words. Lexical items are like semes in that they are \"natural units\" translating between languages, or in learning a new language. In this last sense, it is sometimes said that language consists of grammaticalized lexis, and not lexicalized grammar. The entire store of lexical items in a language is called its lexis.\n\nLexical items composed of more than one word are also sometimes called \"lexical chunks\", \"gambits\", \"lexical phrases\", \"lexical units\", \"lexicalized stems\", or \"speech formulae\". The term \"polyword listemes\" is also sometimes used.\n\nCommon types of lexical items/chunks include \n\n\nAn associated concept is that of noun-modifier semantic relations, wherein certain word pairings have a standard interpretation. For example, the phrase \"cold virus\" is generally understood to refer to the virus that causes a cold, rather than to a virus that is cold.\n\nMany lexical items are either a whole word or part of a word, whereas many other lexical items consist of parts of one or more words or of multiple words in their entirety. A basic question in this area concerns the form-meaning correspondence. Many multi-word lexical items cannot be construed as constituents in syntax in any sense. But if they are not constituents, then how does one classify them? A relatively recent development in the field of syntax envisages lexical items stored in the lexicon as catenae, whereby a given catena may or may not be a constituent. In syntax, a catena is any element or combination of elements (words or parts of words) that are continuous in the vertical dimension, that is, in the hierarchy of words. The elements form a catena insofar as they are linked together by dependencies. Some dependency grammar trees containing multiple-word lexical items that are catenae but not constituents are now produced. The following trees illustrate phrasal verbs:\n\nThe verb and particle (in red) in each case constitute a particle verb construction, which is a single lexical item. The two words remain a catena even as shifting changes their order of appearance. The following trees illustrate polywords:\n\nThe component words of the polywords (in red) are continuous in the vertical dimension and are therefore catenae. They cannot, however, be construed as constituents since they do not form complete subtrees. The following trees illustrate idioms:\n\nThe fixed words constituting the idiom (in red) build a catena each time. Note that \"your\" is not part of the idiom in the first tree (tree a) because the possessor is variable, e.g. \"He is pulling my/her/his/someone's/etc. leg\". An important caveat concerning idiom catenae is that they can be broken up in the syntax, e.g. \"Your leg is being pulled\". The claim, however, is that these lexical items are stored as catenae in the lexicon; they do not always appear as catenae in the actual syntax.\n\n\n"}

It is made by soaking fruit in Scotch whisky and then heating it to absorb the liquor.\n\nThere is much speculation about its origin and its rather curious name. Many culinary scholars think the name of the dish is a reference to the frequent invasions of Scots into Northern England before the new Stuart era united the two nations. These attacks began during Roman times, resulting in the building of Hadrian's Wall, and continued throughout the Middle Ages until James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, became King of England. The name is a pun on the similarity of 'Scotch' to 'Scot', the idea being that the Scotch has 'invaded' the natural juices of the fruit. \n\n\"Marauding Scot\" is made in a similar way to the Cockney dish \"peaches done in Brandy\", as mentioned in the 1959 film version of \"The 39 Steps\", namely by taking the fruit, piercing it, then pouring Scotch over it while it is gently heated. There is much debate about the sequence used. Some believe that it is better to pierce it after the heating has taken place, otherwise it would lose its natural flavour, whereas other chefs believe this misses the point slightly. Other chefs suggest that the heating is unnecessary and in fact dries the fruit, spoiling its taste.\n\nWarning: The flammable nature of Scotch means that this dish should be attempted with great caution. \n\nThe dish is traditionally served with shortbread, inkeeping with its Scottish reference.\n\nIn one of his famous printed sermons of 1549, Thomas, rector of Crawcrook mentions the \"Pillaging Scotte\" as an evil influence on the young people of the town, who had clearly been using the dish as an early form of hip flask.\n\nThe inclusion of Scotch into other recipes to be found throughout the UK is notable, such as a similar dish which is found in Norfolk.\n\n\n"}

It is a speciality of the city of Nagoya.\n\nA popular ingredient of Japanese \"bento\", is a common menu item at bentō shops.\n\nTraditionally \"Kuruma Ebi\" was used, but since a decline in its cultivation, many stores have started using \"black tiger shrimp\" and \"Ise Ebi\". It is thought that ebi furai was created around 1900 in response to the growing popularity of similar dishes such as Tonkatsu and minced meat cutlets in the Western food restaurants of Ginza and Tokyo.\n\nEach prawn is straightened out flat, and a small incision made along its back. The gritty tasting digestive tract is then pulled out of this incision. The prawn is then coated with flour, beaten egg and Japanese breadcrumbs Panko in that order, and deep-fried in hot cooking oil. The head is usually removed before cooking. However, if the prawn is fresh enough, it may be cooked and served whole. Some people prefer to eat the head, which becomes crispy. Fried prawns are often eaten with a choice of thick Worcester sauce, Hoisin sauce, lemon juice or tartare sauce.\n\n\n\"Ebi furai\" is acknowledged as one of Nagoya's specialty foods mainly due to a joke made by the popular Japanese \"tarento\" (celebrity) Tamori about \"ebi furai\" being called \"ebi furyaa\" in the Nagoya dialect. Whilst this term did not exist in the Nagoya dialect prior to his joke, as \"foreign loan words\" generally do not change in Japanese dialects, it led a large portion of his audiences to believe that this was an extant variant used in the Nagoya area.\n\nIn a lecture at Columbia University Kenneth Waltz famously delivered a one-hour monologue on the virtues of fried prawn.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, fried shrimp is known as \"saeu-twigim\" (). Along with \"ojingeo-twigim\" (fried squid) and other \"twigims\", it is a common street food and a \"bunsikjip\" (snack bar) item. It is also a common \"anju\" (food accompanying alcoholic drinks) for beer.\n\nFried shrimp dishes in Philippine cuisine include \"camaron rebosado\" (battered shrimp), \"okoy\" (battered shrimp pancakes), \"halabos na hipon\" (fried or boiled shrimp cooked in its own juices or carbonated soda), and \"nilasing na hipon\" (battered shrimp marinated in alcohol), among others.\n\n\"Camaron rebosado\" is a deep-fried battered shrimp typically served with sweet and sour sauce. It is made by peeling large shrimp and marinating it in a mixture of calamansi juice, salt, and black pepper. It is then coated with a batter made from egg, flour, and corn starch before deep frying.\n\n\"Okoy\" is another native Filipino deep-fried dish that typically use small unshelled shrimp. The batter is uniquely traditionally made from \"galapong\" (ground soaked glutinous rice), mixed with calabaza, sweet potatoes, or cassava and various vegetables like carrots, onions, and green papaya. It is deep-fried into flat crispy pancakes and traditionally served with a vinegar-based dipping sauce.\n"}

{"id": "3884262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3884262", "title": "Butterbrot", "text": "Butterbrot\n\nThe German word Butterbrot (literally: butter bread = bread with butter) describes a slice of bread topped with butter. The words in formal and colloquial German and the different dialects for \"butterbrot\" (different from \"belegtes Brot\" - with cheese, sausages etc.), simply \"Brot\" (\"bread\"), \"Butterstulle\", \"Stulle\", \"Schnitte\" (all three Low German/Berlinerisch dialect), \"Botteramm\" (Colognian dialect), \"Bütterken\" (Lower Rhine dialect) to \"Bemme\" (Upper Saxon German) or \"Knifte\" (Ruhrdeutsch). Although it is increasingly replaced by other foods, it remains a common staple food in Germany. Since 1999, the last Friday in the month of September was made the day of butterbrot by the Marketing Organization of German Agricultural Industries. Russian adopted the term \"buterbrod\" () from New High German (Butterbrot), perhaps as early as the 17th century during the reign of Peter the Great. In modern Russian the term has a more general meaning, whatever the ingredient on top of the slice of bread is. From Russian, the term \"buterbrod\" was adopted into Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Georgian, Kazakh, Ukrainian, and Lithuanian.\n\nA \"Butterbrot\" is commonly a single slice of bread and one \"ingredient\" on top of the butter or margarine. For breakfast, this ingredient tends to be sweet and can be marmalade, jam, honey, chocolate spread, hazelnut spread, or the less common peanut butter. For dinner (in Germany, during the working week people in general eat only one cooked meal per day, which is either lunch or dinner) or as boxed lunch, and often also for breakfast, the \"Butterbrot\" is eaten with something savoury on top, usually a large slice of cold meat or cheese or sliced German Wurst, or one of the countless cream cheese varieties, or even an entire Schnitzel or halved mince meat patty, or hard boiled egg slices or egg salad, or other spreadable creamy salads, or smoked salmon, or various savoury spreads like liverwurst, including also a wide range of vegetarian spreads. Boxed lunch \"Butterbrot\" can be folded for easier handling, and as such remotely resembles the sandwich. In Austria \"Butterbrot\" only refers to a slice of bread with butter. If a topping is added it is named after the topping (e.g. \"Käsebrot\" \"cheese bread\", \"Wurstbrot\" \"sausage bread\").\nThe derivatives of the British sandwich and the \"Butterbrot\" of the German-speaking countries differ in some ways: The \"Butterbrot\" is usually made from the typical bread types of German-speaking countries, which are much firmer, juicier and fuller in taste, and with a crispy crust, compared to English sandwich slices. One popular type is \"Vollkornbrot\" (wholegrain bread), which has a sourish full savoury taste, due to the use of sourdough as a leavening agent, and which often contains rye, albeit bread made from wheat flour is usually the most common variety. Vollkornbrot exists in dozens of varieties with respect to taste, shape, color, etc. However Germans also know a large variety of white or mixed bread kinds, baguette or ciabatta are so common they are sold in every supermarket, and many modern German families simply eat toast with topping for breakfast, as it's cheaper and faster. Another very popular bread type is \"Brötchen\" (bread rolls), of which countless varieties exist in any possible shape, size and made from any possible flour combination.\nThe frequent claims that Germans would constantly eat hard and tasteless \"Graubrot\" and \"Schwarzbrot\" are likely urban legends, or prejudice, possibly originating from soldier tales during World War II. Especially since those kinds of bread are usually the strongest in sourdough flavour.\n\nLikely even more important are differences with respect to what is eaten on top of a \"Butterbrot\" or in a sandwich. Although exceptions exist, a \"Butterbrot\" is commonly not expanded the way sandwiches are. One slice of cheese and one or (in case of thin slices) maybe two slices of cold meat are commonly considered sufficient; adding lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mustard, mayonnaise etc. happens only following individual preferences. Also the ratio of bread and \"topping\" is relatively constant, thick fancy sandwich fillings have almost no equivalent for the \"Butterbrot\".\n\nGerman speakers differentiate between the German-style \"Butterbrot\" and the British-style \"sandwich\" by using the English word \"sandwich\" for the latter.\n\nAs a conclusion one may say that the \"Butterbrot\" is a type of open faced sandwich, using well made savoury bread slices, and with simpler straightforward toppings. However one of the reasons why the Germans prefer just butter and simpler toppings is because they take such pride in the quality and taste of their breads.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, the \"butterbrot\" has been displaced gradually in the last 40 years by muesli, breakfast cereals or toast for breakfast and take-away bakery products during daytime.\n\nNonetheless, it remains a common staple food among many Germans. In addition it remains popular in the evening. It is also eaten a lot on hiking trips. In many parts of Germany the butterbrot is still very common for second breakfast at school or work (much more often eaten than, for example, fast food).\n\nUsually in September every year, the Central Marketing Society for German Agriculture (CMA, the agricultural industry's now-defunct lobby group) used to declare a \"day of the German Butterbrot\". The 8th Butterbrot day's motto in 2006 was: \"Re-Experience Enjoyment\". The celebration was one of many \"Days of...\" and not very well known in Germany.\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other former Soviet republics, \"buterbrod\" hasn't experienced any decline and remains a common staple of food. It is usually distinguished from sandwiches. In the Russian language, the term \"сэндвич\" (\"sandwich\") hasn't been russified to the same degree and hasn't been in use as long as \"buterbrod\", and usually \"sandwich\" is only used for two slices of bread with some ingredient in between, especially sandwiches made in fastfood chains and restaurants.\n\nButterbrots (correct German plural: Butterbrote) and their variants are said to always fall to the floor (and especially on a fuzzy carpet) with the buttered side downwards (see: Murphy's law). A common explanation is that the top side is usually heavier than the bottom side. This applies more to Nutella/jam breads than cheese/meat breads. Another is tied to the common height of tables. The subject has been researched by various sources, e.g. the famous children's series Die Sendung mit der Maus, and the scientific German TV series \"Quarks & Co\". It is often joked about what would happen if you tie a butterbrot to the back of a cat, in the same manner that hypothetical buttered toast attached to the back of a cat is sometimes joked about, with it being debated whether the feline would still honour the popular axiom, that a cat \"always lands on its feet\", or if the butterbrot would be \"stronger\", making the cat fall on its back — alternatively, it is sometimes humorously suggested that the cat would simply levitate, as it would be unable to satisfy both criteria for landing.\n\n\n"}

Another difference is that the vowel length distinctions of German do not exist in Standard Yiddish.\n\nThere are consonantal differences between German and Yiddish. Yiddish deaffricates the Middle High German voiceless labiodental affricate to initially (as in \"funt\"; though this pronunciation is also quasi-standard throughout northern and central Germany); /pf/ surfaces as an unshifted medially or finally (as in and ).

The purpose of such a test is to provide a quantitative statistical measure of \"humanness\", which may subsequently be used to optimize the performance of artificial intelligence systems intended to imitate human responses.\n\nMcKinstry gathered approximately 80,000 propositions that could be answered yes or no, e.g.:\n\n\nHe called these propositions Mindpixels.\n\nThese questions test both specific knowledge of aspects of culture, and basic facts about the meaning of various words and concepts. It could therefore be compared with the SAT, intelligence testing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program could be considered intelligent at all.\n\nAccording to McKinstry, a program able to do much better than chance on a large number of MIST questions would be judged to have some level of intelligence and understanding. For example, on a 20-question test, if a program were guessing the answers at random, it could be expected to score 10 correct on average. But the probability of a program scoring 20 out of 20 correct by guesswork is only one in 2, i.e. one in 1,048,576; so if a program were able to sustain this level of performance over several independent trials, with no prior access to the propositions, it should be considered intelligent.\n\nMcKinstry criticized existing approaches to artificial intelligence such as chatterbots, saying that his questions could \"kill\" AI programs by quickly exposing their weaknesses. He contrasted his approach, a series of direct questions assessing an AI's capabilities, to the Turing test and Loebner Prize method of engaging an AI in undirected typed conversation.\n\nCritics of the MIST have noted that it would be easy to \"kill\" a McKinstry-style AI too, due to the impossibility of supplying it with correct answers to all possible yes/no questions by ways of a finite set of human-generated Mindpixels: the fact that an AI can answer the question \"Is the sun bigger than my foot?\" correctly does not mean that it can answer variations like \"Is the sun bigger than (my hand | my liver | an egg yolk | Alpha Centauri A | ...)\" correctly, too.\n\nHowever, the late McKinstry might have replied that a truly intelligent, knowledgeable entity (on a par with humans) would be able to work out answers such as (yes | yes | yes | don't know | ...) by applying its knowledge of the relative sizes of the objects named. In other words, the MIST was intended as a test of AI, not as a suggestion for implementing AI.\n\nIt can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator's gullibility than of the machine's intelligence. According to this argument, a human's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the ELIZA effect, a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, anthropomorphizing the program. The response, suggested by Alan Turing's essay \"Can Machines Think?\", is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent. The dispute is thus over what it means for a program to have \"real\" intelligence, and by what signs it can be detected.\n\nA similar debate exists in the controversy over Great Ape language, in which nonhuman primates are said to have learned some aspects of sign languages but the significance of this learning is disputed.\n\n"}

The confection was known only as \"Chocodile\" prior to 2014. The package describes the snack cake as a \"chocolate coated sponge cake with creamy filling.\" The Chocodile is Twinkie-shaped and sold in packages of two.\n\nThe Chocodile mascot was formerly Chauncey Chocodile, but Hostess has removed him from packaging and their website in recent years. Since the late 1990s, Chocodiles have no longer been sold on the East Coast of the United States. Hostess had only a few West Coast factories making them, and to ensure the products' freshness, Chocodiles were sold only on the West Coast.\n\nThere has been debate over whether a Chocodile is a chocolate-covered Twinkie. The debate arose from the seeming \"texture difference\" between the Twinkie and the Chocodile. During a taste test and debate in Vacaville, California, opinions were split among those taking the test, as to whether the taste of the cake was the same. This issue was resolved during a show on the Food Network where it was confirmed by Hostess that the Chocodile was, in fact, a chocolate-covered Twinkie. This has caused consternation for some who continue to swear the cake is different. In actuality, it's the chocolate that makes the difference. Due to the chocolate coating, the cake tends to stay more moist, leading to the slightly different texture when compared to a normal Twinkie.\n\nIn 2014, Hostess Brands reintroduced the cake as \"Chocodile Twinkies\". The new cakes are 1.45 oz. each, and are labelled as \"Fun size\" as the original Chocodiles were 2 oz. each. They are also now available on the East Coast.\n\nIn 2017, Hostess reintroduced the \"full sized\" Chocodiles as \"Fudge Covered Twinkies\".\n\nIn the television series \"American Dad!\", as Roger the alien's favorite snack.

Etymologically, the word comes from Rabelais' \"Third Book of Pantagruel\" (Tiers livre, 1546), in which it is written as \"salmigondin\". It seems to appear in English for the first time in the 17th century as a dish of cooked meats, seafood, vegetables, fruit, leaves, nuts and flowers and dressed with oil, vinegar and spices. There is some debate over sense and origin of the word. The French word \"salmigondis\" has come to mean a hodgepodge or mix of widely disparate things.\n\nIn English culture the term does not refer to a single recipe, but describes the grand presentation of a large plated salad comprising many disparate ingredients. These can be arranged in layers or geometrical designs on a plate or mixed. The ingredients are then drizzled with a dressing. The dish aims to produce wide range of flavours and colours and textures on a single plate. Often recipes allow the cook to add various ingredients which may be available at hand, producing many variations of the dish. Flowers from broom and sweet violet were often used.\n\nIn Jamaica, Solomon gundy refers more specifically to a dish made of salt herring and spices.\n\nCut cold roast chicken or other meats into slices. Mix with minced tarragon and an onion. Mix all together with capers, olives, samphire, broombuds, mushrooms, oysters, lemon, orange, raisins, almonds, blue figs, Virginia potatoes, peas and red and white currants. Garnish with sliced oranges and lemons. Cover with oil and vinegar, beaten together. (From \"The Good Huswives Treasure\", Anon, 1588–1660)\n\n\nSalmagundi is also purportedly a meal served on pirate ships. It is a stew of anything the cook had on hand, usually consisting of chopped meat, anchovies, eggs, and onions, often arranged in rows on lettuce and served with vinegar and oil, and spiced with anything available. The following is taken from a reprint of \"Mrs. Hill's New Cook Book\", originally published in 1867 and republished by Applewood Books of Bedford, Massachusetts.\nBoil two calf's feet; take the feet out when done; reduce the broth to a quart. The feet may be fried and used, first removing the bones. Let the broth become cold in an earthen vessel; scrape off all the grease; wipe the top of the jelly with a coarse towel; put the cake of jelly into a kettle lined with tin or porcelain; season it with two lemons cut up (removing the seed), fine blades of mace, a stick of cinnamon, pepper (white pepper is best), and salt to taste. Beat to a froth the whites of six eggs; stir these to the jelly just as it melts; it must then be left to clarify and not stirred again. When it simmers long enough to look clear at the sides, strain it through a flannel bag before the fire; do not squeeze the bag. Suspend it by running a stick through a loop made by tying the bag; rest each end of the stick upon a chair, and throw a table-cloth over all to keep out the dust. If the jelly does not run through clear the first time, pour it through the jelly-bag again. Set this aside. Prepare the meat and seasoning for the pie. Put into a stew-pan slices of pickled pork, using a piece of pork four inches square; if it is very salt[y] lay it an hour in tepid water. Cut up two young, tender chickens—a terrapin, if it is convenient—two or three young squirrels, half a dozen birds or squabs. Stew them gently, cutting up and adding a few sprigs of parsley. Roll into half a pound of butter two tablespoonfuls of flour; add this to the stew until the meat is nearly done. Line a fire-proof dish, or two fire-proof dishes (this quantity of stew will fill two common-sized or quart dishes;) with good pastry; mix the different kinds of meats; put in Irish potato dumplings; season to taste; pour in the gravy and bake. When done, remove the upper crust when the pie is cold and pack in the jelly, heaping the jelly in the middle. Return the crust and serve cold or hot. The jelly will prevent them become too dry. They are good Christmas pies and will keep several days. Very little gravy should be used, and that rich. Should there be too much, leave the stew-pan open until reduced sufficiently. This kind of pie keeps well if made in deep plates, and by some is preferred to those baked in deep moulds.\n\nThe word salmagundi is derived from the French word \"salmigondis\" which means disparate assembly of things, ideas or people, forming an incoherent whole. Salmagundi is used figuratively in modern English to mean a mixture or assortment of things.\n\nThe name later evolved to \"Solomon Gundy\" in the eighteenth century. It seems likely that the name is connected with the children’s rhyme, Solomon Grundy. Solomon Gundy retains its food connotation today as the name given to a spicy Caribbean paste made of mashed, pickled herrings, peppers and onions.\n\n\n"}

Its origins date as far back as the Viking era and possibly even earlier to the time of the Picts.  \n\nCrowdie is a variety of lactic cheese. These rely primarily on the action of the bacteria converting the milk lactose to lactic acid to create curds. When the milk acidity becomes high enough, the milk will coagulate even without the use of rennet.\n\nCrowdie used to be made by letting raw skimmed milk warm on a windowsill or by the fire until it was thickened naturally by the lactic acid which formed as the milk soured. The thickened milk was then heated gently until curds were formed. The warm curds were hung up to drip in a muslin cloth to drain the whey, then mixed with salt and sometimes a little cream to make a soft, crumbly cheese with a high moisture content and short shelf life. The natural souring of the unpasteurised milk gave the cheese its fresh, slightly citric taste.\n\nFollowing WWII crowdie production on a domestic scale declined with the passing of crafting traditions. Its survival is credited to Susannah Stone, who continued to make it near the Ross-shire village of Tain. Apparently one day in 1962, after making too much, she offered the surplus to a local grocer. Her traditional crowdie became popular enough that she and her husband began to produce it commercially with their other traditional Scottish cheeses.\n\nCrowdie is now usually made from pasteurised milk in which most of the bacteria have been killed, so lactic acid is added to the milk to begin the souring process.\n\nThe cheese is often eaten with oatcakes and recommended before a ceilidh, as it is said to alleviate the effects of drinking whisky. There are several variations on the basic Crowdie: one variety known as \"Black Crowdie\" or \"Gruth Dubh\" is made by mixing crowdie with double cream and rolling it in a mixture of pinhead oatmeal and crushed black peppercorns. Hramsais is a crowdie mixed with wild garlic and white and red pepper. Galic Hramsa is rolled in crumbled flaked hazelnuts and almonds.\n\nOne of the most popular ways of eating the cheese is to turn it into a dessert called Cream Crowdie or Cranachan, traditionally eaten as part of a Burn's Supper. The recipe usually includes double cream, oats, whisky, honey and raspberries.\n\n"}
{"id": "3911635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3911635", "title": "Potnia", "text": "Potnia\n\nPotnia is an Ancient Greek word for \"Mistress, Lady\" and a title of a goddess. The word was inherited by Classical Greek from Mycenean Greek with the same meaning and it was applied to several goddesses. A similar word is the title Despoina, \"the mistress\", which was given to the nameless chthonic goddess of the mysteries of Arcadian cult. She was later conflated with Kore (Persephone), \"the maid\", the goddess of the Eleusinian mysteries, in a life-death rebirth cycle which leads the neophyte from death into life and immortality. Karl Kerenyi identifies Kore with the nameless \"Mistress of the labyrinth\", who probably presided over the palace of Knossos in Minoan Crete.\n\nPotnia (Greek: , \"mistress\") is a poetic title of honour, used chiefly in addressing females, whether goddesses or women; its masculine analogue is \"posis\" (). Its hypothetical Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form \"*\", \"mistress\", \"lady\", \"wife\", is the feminine counterpart to \"*pótis\", \"husband\"; cf. Latin \"ho\", \"host\", Sanskrit ', \"master\", \"husband\", fem. ', \"lady\", \"wife\". \"Potnia\" is attested in the Linear B script in Mycenean Greek: \"po-ti-ni-ja\". The word was inherited in classical Greek with the same meaning. A related Greek word is \"despoina\" (\"Des-potnia\" from PIE \"*dems-potnia\" meaning \"mistress of the house\"). An alternative etymology of the goddess Demeter comes through Potnia and Despoina (\"Dems-meter\", from PIE \"*dems-méh₂tēr\", meaning \"mother of the house\").\n\nThe figure of a goddess of nature, of birth and death was dominant during the Bronze Age, in both Minoan and Mycenean cults. In the Mycenean cult she was known by the title Potnia. The earliest references to the title are inscriptions in Linear B (Mycenean Greek) syllabic script found at Pylos and at Knossos, Crete, dated 1450-1300 BC. On a number of tablets from Pylos, we find \"po-ti-ni-ja\" (\"potnia\") without any accompanying word. Chadwick suggests that she was the mother-goddess of the Mycenaeans. It seems that she had an important shrine at the site \"Pakijanes\" near Pylos. Wanax (\"wa-na-ka\") was her male companion in the Mycenean cult, and this title was usually applied to the god Poseidon (\"po-se-da-o\") as king of the underworld. Another epithet of Poseidon was \"e-ne-si-da-o-ne\" (\"earth-shaker\") and in the cave of Amnisos (Crete) \"Enesidaon\" is related to the cult of Eileithyia. She was a goddess of nature concerned with the annual birth of the divine child. Potnia and her male companion (\"paredros\") survived in the Eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered : \"Mighty Potnia has born a strong son\".\n\nAn inscription from Knossos refers to the \"potnia of the labyrinth\", who probably presided over the palace of Knossos (\"da-pu-ri-to-jo,po-ti-ni-ja\"). A famous Minoan seal impression found by Arthur Evans shows a nameless goddess brandishing a spear and standing upon the representation of a mountain flanked by rampant lions, and the representation seems similar to the Homeric potnia theron (the mistress of the animals).\n\nSeveral tablets in Linear B script found at Knossos and Pylos refer to the \"potnia\". Potnia is almost always accompanied by an epithet characterizing a particular place or function of the mistress : \"po-ti-ni-ja,a-si-wi-ja\" (\"a-si-wi-ja\" = ethnic adjective, possibly \"Asian (Lydian) woman\"), \"si-to-po-ti-ni-ja\" (\"sitos\" = \"grain\", of wheat or barley; probably referring to Demeter or her predecessor), \"po-ti-ni-ja,i-qe-ja\" (\"Potnia Hippeia\", \"Horse Goddess\"). At Knossos a tablet refers to \"a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja\", \"potnia Athana\", a form similar to the later Homeric form.\n\nThis divine title could be the translation of a similar title of Pre-Greek origin, just as the title \"Our Lady\" in Christianity is translated in several languages. The Pre-Greek name may be related to \"a-sa-sa-ra \", a possible interpretation of inscriptions found in Linear A texts. Although Linear A is not yet deciphered, Palmer relates tentatively the inscription \"a-sa-sa-ra-me\" which seems to have accompanied goddesses, with the Hittite \"išhaššara\", which means \"lady or mistress\", and especially with \"išhaššaramis\" (my lady).\n\nIn classical Greece the title \"potnia\" is usually applied to the goddesses Demeter, Artemis, Athena, and Persephone. This title was also given to the earth goddess Gaia (Ge). A similar title \"Despoina\", \"the mistress\", was given to the nameless goddess of the mysteries of Arcadian cult, later conflated with Kore (Persephone), the goddess of the Eleusinian mysteries. Homer in the \"Iliad\" (xxi 470) mentions a \"potnia theron\" (\"mistress of the animals\") who is obviously Artemis. Karl Kerenyi identifies Persephone with the nameless \"mistress of the labyrinth\". Demeter and Persephone were the two great goddesses of the Arcadian cults. According to Pausanias at Olympia they were called \"Despoinai\" (\"mistresses\", plural of \"Despoina\"). Demeter and Persephone were also called \"Demeteres\" as duplicates of the earth goddess with a double function as chthonic and vegetation goddesses.\n\n"}

It is also used for comedy oriented shows that focus more on stand-up and skits, and quiz/trivia type shows featuring comic elements. It is not to be expected that a variety show will always follow the same format, and guests from Japanese music and talent pools are frequent.\n\nThe variety style shows generally divided into segments of games, features, and \"corners\", some very short and some shows focusing (for a special episode) solely on one game or feature.

Game shows without any famous characters playing the role of contestants are rare.\n\nOf these sections and games, many can be seen recurring on a variety of shows all across Japan. It may even be possible to classify Japanese variety shows (or at least the individual sections of the shows) according to the following formats:\n\nSome concepts of variety shows are consistent over most of Japanese television, though they may be considered quite different from those seen in the western world. Many shows are made up of what are called VTRs, or video segments, and are usually introduced with a hand gesture and the word \"dōzo\" (the implied meaning is \"let's have a look\"), though this procedure is usually made into a joke with strange gestures instead of the usual wave.\n\nA few popular variety/comedy shows of varying contents are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Home health care is a cost efficient way to deliver quality care in the convenience of the client's home. Home health nurses create care plans to achieve goals based on the client's diagnosis. These plans can include preventative, therapeutic, and rehabilitative actions. Home health nurses also supervise certified nursing assistants. The professional nursing organization for home health nurses is the Home Healthcare Nurses Association (HHNA). Home health care is intended for clients that are well enough to be discharged home, but still require skilled nursing personnel to assess, initiate and oversee nursing interventions.\n\nLillian Wald is recognized as the pioneer of public health nursing. She established the Henry Street Settlement which served underprivileged individuals and families. Nurses and social workers that worked at the Henry Street Settlement visited patients in their homes, assessed their health needs, and provided support with hygiene, nutrition, immunizations and more. Wald was able to convince Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to cover home care services. This allowed public health nursing to shift from charitable work to profitable work.\n\nThere is a wide range of services that are performed by many different professionals, services include wound care, disease management, medical equipment, therapy, medical social services, and patient education. Home health nurses have a wide range of duties and services provided, and in addition to services provided nurses also consult with doctors on the status of the patient and provide feedback on any potential changes that need to be made to the care plan.\n\nSome responsibilities that home health nurses take on include promoting health and disease prevention, medication administration, educating patients on their current diagnosis, providing emotional support, and providing basic care such as personal hygiene.\n\nNurses also step into the role of case managers, meaning that they coordinate services from different disciplines for the patient. This can include rehabilitation, pharmacy, community resources and more.\n\nProviding the most up-to-date and effective care for a patient is also a very important part of a home health nurse's job. They do this by continually keeping up to date on the latest research and Evidence-Based Practice.\n\nHome health nurses can have a nursing diploma, be a licensed practical nurse, have an associate of science in nursing, or a bachelor of science in nursing. They can then sit for a test through the American Nurses Credentialing Center that will allow them to become a certified home health care nurse.\n\nThe scope of home health nursing is directly related to the nursing process. This includes assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. The standards of home health nursing integrate research, education, proper use of resources, the quality of care provided, team collaboration, and ethical principles.\n\nHome health nursing is a unique field considering the obstacles faced by the healthcare professionals. When out visiting clients, the nurse is alone and is not able to rely on others most of the time. Nurses in home health care must learn to be autonomous.\n\nThe variety of home condition that a nurse will step into can also present problems. Cleanliness and safety play large roles in client care. Not all homes are equipped to provide a clean environment for the client. Environmental issues in the home include unsanitary conditions that allow for bacterial growth and conditions that may increase the risk of falling for the client, such as poor lighting and area rugs. Education regarding this is important for the nurse to share with the client.\n\nMedication adherence is also more complicated at home. Unlike in a hospital setting, the medication is scheduled around the clock and readily available. It is really dependent on the client's resources and financial situation. Also, client compliance, or client adherence to the plan of care, factors into client health outcomes.\n\nHome health care is generally less expensive and more convenient then in the hospital. When possible home health care helps regain independence, become more self-sufficient, and maintain current level of function. The primary payer for home health care is Medicare dependent on meeting certain eligibility criteria.\n\nHome health services are covered when all of the following criteria are met:\nEligibility for home health care is determined by intermittent skilled nursing care that is needed fewer than 7 days each week and daily less than 8 hours each day for up to 21 days. If skilled nursing care is needed more than this over extended period of time it would not qualify for home health benefits under Medicare guidelines.\n"}

While two relatively large states developed within the Holy Roman Empire, both—the Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia—were really multinational empires that included substantial non-German territories and lands outside the borders of the Holy Roman Empire, while excluding major parts of Germany proper.\n\nApart from these two states, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of hundreds of small, German-speaking principalities, most of which derived from successive dynastic splits (feudal fragmentation), sometimes reflected in compound names such as Saxe-Coburg; some of these were united through royal marriages, although the resulting entity was often not a contiguous territory. During the early modern period, these small states modernised their military, judicial, and economic administrations. These hardly existed at the imperial level, and the emperor was little more than a feudalistic confederal figurehead, without political or military clout. After the Reformation, the Empire's small states were divided along religious lines. Those headed by Roman Catholic dynasties faced those ruled by Protestant dynasties in the Thirty Years' War and other conflicts.\n\nAfter French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte forced the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, to dissolve the Empire in 1806, \"Kleinstaaterei\" was altered, but not eliminated. Through the elimination of territories ruled by prince-bishops (secularisation) and through the consolidation of neighbouring principalities, enclaves and exclaves, Napoleon reduced several hundred states into a relative concentration of a little over two dozen states in the Confederation of the Rhine. This confederation did not survive Napoleon's military defeat at the hands of the allies, but the previous principalities were not entirely restored. Prussia and the Austrian Empire—the successor state to the Habsburg Monarchy—were the only major German powers, and neither had been part of the Confederation of the Rhine. The victorious allies, including Prussia and Austria, decided at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15) on widespread dynastic restorations, although some of Napoleon's consolidations were maintained, and Austria and Prussia helped themselves to some formerly independent territories. The resulting territorial division resulted in a consolidated version—around 40 states—of the pre-Napoleonic \"Kleinstaaterei\".\n\nThe rise of nationalism across Europe brought movements striving for \"nation-states\", each governing an entire (ethno-cultural) people. German nationalists began to insist on a unified Germany. The call for a unified nation-state was one of the central demands of the Revolutions of 1848, but the ruling dynasties of the smaller German states and of multinational Austria and Prussia managed to resist nationalist efforts at unification. Also German writer and statesman Goethe had always opposed this, writing: \"Frankfurt, Bremen, Hamburg, Luebeck are large and brilliant, and their impact on the prosperity of Germany is incalculable. Yet, would they remain what they are if they were to lose their independence and be incorporated as provincial cities into one great German Empire? I have reason to doubt this.\"\n\nOnly after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck gradually built a unified German state under the Prussian royal house of Hohenzollern did \"Kleinstaaterei\" largely end in 1871 with the founding of the German Empire. (The only surviving petty states—Luxembourg and Liechtenstein—lie at the periphery of the German-speaking world.) The founding of the German Empire created a largely German nation-state. While the German Empire excluded the partly German but multinational Habsburg domains of Austria–Hungary, it included a substantial Polish minority in parts of eastern Prussia and other minorities along its northern and western borders. The unification of the German Empire put Germany on the map as a major European power, albeit too late to become a major colonial presence. Internally in the nation some of these fragmented boundaries and small political units continued to exist until the modern States of Germany were established in the Federal Republic after World War II.\n\nThe decentralised nature of \"Kleinstaaterei\" made it difficult for the German economy to live up to its potential. Varying systems of weights and measures, different currencies and numerous tariffs impeded trade and investment, although the creation of the German Customs Union had begun to lift these barriers. The startling rapidity of Germany's economic growth after unification under Bismarck provided further evidence that the \"Kleinstaaterei\" had been economically repressive. The system did contribute to cultural diversity within Germany, and the numerous rival courts—though usually politically insignificant—often gained some renown through patronage.\n\nToday, the term \"Kleinstaaterei\" is sometimes used in the German media and elsewhere in a figurative sense to describe the German political system of federalism in a critical way, especially referring to its seeming inefficiency to decide on reforms in political fields that are the responsibility of the \"Länder\" and thus are under the auspices of sixteen different administrations. As of 2010, \"Kleinstaaterei\" is most often invoked in matters of educational policy, such as the difficulties caused by the different school systems for children of families that move from one \"Land\" to another.\n\n"}
{"id": "3943884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3943884", "title": "High-motion", "text": "High-motion\n\nHigh motion is the characteristic of video or film footage displayed possessing a sufficiently high frame rate (or field rate) that moving images do not blur or strobe even when tracked closely by the eye. The most common forms of high motion are NTSC and PAL video (i.e., \"normal television\") at their native display rates. Movie film (at the standard 24 frame/s) does not portray high motion even when shown on television monitors.\n\nIn the early 20th century when 35 mm movie film was developed, producers found that 18–24 frames per second was adequate for portraying motion in a movie theater environment. Flicker was still a problem at these rates, but projectors solved this by projecting each frame twice, thus creating a refresh rate of 36–48 Hz without using excessive amounts of film. However when television was developed, there was no corresponding way to capture a video frame and project it twice. The solution to this was interlace, which had a side effect that 50 to 60 images per second were presented to the viewer.\n\nTelevision producers found that these higher image rates made certain shots possible that were unacceptable on film. Camera pans and text scrolls could be faster. Handheld camera work seemed less objectionable, and most importantly, sports action was much clearer — particularly when following a ball was critical.\n\nThere are no commonly used imaging systems that run at rates higher than 30 frame/s but lower than 48 Hz, so 48 Hz or higher is the de facto standard for high motion. The effects of high motion can be reduced or negated by converter lag when NTSC video is converted to PAL, or vice versa (a particular problem for coverage of international sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup, for example); however, more recent motion adaptive converters can minimize this. Showscan's research indicates that an average of 66.7 frames per second is the upper limit of what the human eye can perceive, and higher frame rates have no further effect, except in reducing flicker. (See refresh rate.)\n\nUntil the late 1990s, programs shot on video always possessed high motion, while programming shot on film never did. (The exceptions: Certain motion simulators and amusement park rides included film projected at 48–60 frames per second, and video recorded on kinescope film recorders lost its high motion characteristic.) This had the result of high motion being associated with news coverage and low-budget programming such as soap operas and some sitcoms. Higher-budget programming on television was usually shot on film. In the 1950s, when Hollywood experimented with higher frame rates for films (such as with the Todd AO process) some objected to the more video-like look (although the inability to convert such films for projection in regular theaters was a more serious problem).\n\nHigh motion is often criticized as interfering with the suspension of disbelief, and making it difficult to forget that the viewer is watching actors performing a scene. Some feel that this is an inherent advantage to lower frame rates, while others suggest that it is due to the historical availability of high motion only in programs that are least able to use the medium artistically, and the evolution of acting techniques based on lack of high motion. In areas where high-motion drama is more common, such as Britain, viewers tend to tolerate the look better.\n\nIn the mid and late 2000s, digital video technology had started to make it possible to shoot video at the \"film look\" rate of 24 frame/s at little or no additional cost. This had resulted in less high motion on television and on the internet on Video sharing applications such as YouTube in the early to mid 2010s.\n\nThe future presence of digital projectors in theaters opens up the possibility that Hollywood movies could someday include high motion—perhaps in action films intercut with 24 frame/s for non-action scenes. The MaxiVision48 3-perf film format promotes this use with its ability to switch from 24 frame/s to 48 frame/s on the fly during projection. However, 3-perf has not seen much adaptation as a projection format.\n\nDirector Peter Jackson's three-part \"Hobbit\" film series was shot at 48 fps, using the Red Digital Cinema Epic video camera system.\n\nMany action cameras of the 2010s take video at High-Motion frame rates. GoPro, Sony and other action camera competitors record video at 1080p and 2.7k at 120fps, 720p and 1080p at 240fps, and 4k at 60fps. Although the video formats were designed for slowing down in post-production, the cameras generally record very high frame rates in high definition with generally clear audio. \n\nAlong side action cameras, gaming monitors often display very high refresh rates as high as 240 Hz as of 2017, while generally the standard is 144hz. This means gaming displays can display videos shot at high motion and play them back at their proper frame rates in real time at up to 240fps, achieving basically an authentic high motion look.\nThe human eye can perceive anywhere from 480fps to 4000fps , and see it as looking completely realistic or immersive naturally. While 120fps looks 'realistic', the stroboscopic look can still be seen, which also happens on 60 Hz monitors playing 60fps video and sometimes excessive motion blur, depending on the camera and shutter speed that was used when the video was recorded. Otherwise, videos over 200fps are more preferred, since they look more fluid and realistic naturally or by simply changing the shutter speed with an ND filter at frame rates between 50fps and 120fps.. \n\nYouTube in October 2014 started to allow for the beginning of High-Motion content or High Frame Rate content, as well as videos before 2014 uploaded at over 30fps, up to 60fps.\n\nIn the context of digital video compression, \"high motion\" is sometimes used to describe footage in which frames change too rapidly for motion prediction techniques to be effective. This article describes only the high frame rate definition.\n\n"}

It is only a \"system\" if it is applied to a large group of such taxa (for example, all the flowering plants).\n\nThere are two main criteria for this list. A system must be taxonomic, that is deal with a large number of plants, by their botanical names. Secondly it must be a system, i.e. deal with the relationships of plants. Although thinking about relationships of plants had started much earlier (see history of plant systematics), such systems really only came into being in the 19th century, as a result of an ever-increasing influx from all over the world of newly discovered plant species. The 18th century saw some early systems, which are perhaps precursors rather than full taxonomic systems.\n\nA milestone event was the publication of \"Species Plantarum\" by Linnaeus which serves as the starting point of binomial nomenclature for plants. By its size this would qualify to be on this list, but it does not deal with relationships, beyond assigning plants into genera.\n\nNote that a system is not necessarily monolithic and often goes through several stages of development, resulting in several versions of the same system. When a system is widely adopted, many authors will adopt their own particular version of the system. The Cronquist system is well known for existing in many versions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Yams are peeled, sliced, cleaned, dried and then blended into a flour, also called \"elubo\". Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried; this gives àmàlà its colour. Àmàlà is from Western Africa and eaten mostly by the Yoruba people in Nigeria. It could be served with a variety of ọbẹ (soups), such as ẹfọ, ilá, ewédú, ogbono or gbegiri (black-eyed beans soup).\n\nThere are two types of àmàlà: \"àmàlà isu\" and \"àmàlà láfún\".\n\nThis is the most common type of àmàlà which is derived from yam. The particular yam specie best for preparing àmàlà is Dioscorea cayenensis because of its high starch content. Yam, the common name for species in the genus \"Dioscorea\", grows in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Latin America, but 95% of it is cultivated and harvested in West Africa. Yam can be barbecued, roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, smoked, and grated. Àmàlà isu is made of dried yam; this gives it a black/brownish colour when added to boiling water. Amala is high in carbohydrates and packs a lot of calories.\n\nThe second type is àmàlà láfún, made from cassava flour. Cassava is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae (spurge) family. Cassava and yam are the most important source of food carbohydrate in Nigeria; Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava. Cassava flour when used as a dry powder makes àmàlà láfún. Fermented and flaky, it is called Garri, another common dish, most often eaten by the Ijebu people.\n\nAnother type of Amala is \"elubo ogede\" (which is usually lighter in color). The low carbohydrate level in plantain flour makes it a good food for diabetics and others who need a low-carbohydrate food. Unripe plantain is peeled, dried, and grated into boiling water to become amala ogede, light brown in colour when cooked.\n\nThe only ingredient needed when making àmàlà is boiling water and one of the types of flour. Once the water has come to a boil, the heat is reduced. The flour is added and stirred until all the water is absorbed. More hot water is added, then the dough is left to simmer for approximately five minutes. Then the dough is kneaded until it has the desired texture. Kneading the dough into a smooth paste is the most difficult part of making àmàlà.\n\nÀmàlà can be eaten with various soups:\n\n\n"}

The original large size Mini-Wheats was renamed \"Big Bite\" by 2001 and discontinued entirely in 2015. In 1999, Kellogg's went into the line by introducing a non-frosted Mini-Wheats variety that contained raisin filling, replacing Raisin Squares. It was discontinued in 2 years. Frosted Wheats were available from the 1980s until the early 1990s in the United Kingdom under the Toppas name. They subsequently disappeared from shop shelves but were reissued several years later under the Frosted Wheats brand, similar to that used elsewhere in the world. The new cereal uses far smaller pieces of frosted wheat parcel than the original Toppas and contains beef gelatin. Initially Kellogg's Mini Wheats were available without the sugar frosting and with raisins or blueberries in the center. The Mini-Wheats recipe when produced in Canada or the United States was slightly different. Since January 2008, Canadian-produced (plant in Belleville, Ontario) Mini-Wheats are available in Canada and are imported into the US.\n\nFrosted Mini-Wheats are marketed variously. They tolerated a short stint on television advertisements with a series of commercials about one Frosted Mini-Wheat with \"split personalities;\" the sweet (frosted) side and wheat (shredded grain) side argued over who was more popular. When the new MyPyramid debuted, launching the whole grain craze, it enjoyed another short-lived advertising stint as a fiber-conscious cereal. These advertisements involved a man walking around, asking \"Have you had your fiber today?\", then handing unsuspecting, confused people a bowl of the cereal. However, these ads have discontinued. Meanwhile, in the early/mid-1990s, several ads aired showcasing conflict between children raving about the frosting and adults raving about the whole grain wheat. The best-known of these \"The Kid in You\" ads feature adults turning into children and kids turning into adults (actress Marcia Wallace appears in one of those \"Kid in Us\" spots, and one used the famous line from \"When Harry Met Sally...\", \"I'll have what she's having.\", which was said by an elderly woman sitting next to a young businesswoman who turned into a 13-year-old girl in front of her).\n\nCurrent advertising involves Frosted Mini-Wheats helping children in various childhood situations. In one, a girl in a spelling bee retracts a letter after speaking it and passes, despite the fact that it is against the rules in an actual Spelling Bee competition. Another has the Mini-Wheat helping a girl keep time to a dance in a school play. It promotes eating breakfast in general. The tagline says, \"Keeps 'em [your kids] full, and keeps 'em focused.\" The Federal Trade Commission found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%. The consumer protection agency said that Kellogg's had misrepresented a study and violated federal law.\n\nIn 2009, Kelloggs introduced a \"Little Bites\" spinoff of the Mini-Wheats brand. This version had smaller squares and came in three flavors: Original, Chocolate, and Honey Nut. Eventually, the Honey Nut flavor was taken off of shelves and replaced with Cinnamon Roll, which was also short-lived.\n\nIn 2011, Kelloggs introduced Frosted Mini-Wheats with Fruit in the Middle, which features strawberries and blueberries in the center. These are similar to the original Strawberry Mini-Wheats that Kellogg's sold in the 1990s which contained strawberry filling in the middle, as well as Raisin Squares and its successor Mini-Wheats Raisin, and Fruit Wheats, a variant of Nabisco Shredded Wheat made in the 1980s.\n\nAn ad for Mini-Wheats that aired in Canada in the early-1990s featured an animated \"Mr. Mini-Wheat\" (voiced by John Stocker) about to go on a blind date. After experiencing some pre-date anxiety, a disembodied voice convinces Mr. Mini-Wheat that between his wholesome wheatiness and his frosted side, he has much to offer. Now quite confident, Mr. Mini-Wheat sets off for his date, proclaiming that \"She'll be my love slave forever!\". This line was quickly changed to \"She'll be my true love forever!\" for later airings.\n\nMore recently, an advertisement for Vanilla flavoured Mini-Wheats featured an animated Mr Mini-Wheat singing and dancing to a tune based on \"Agadoo\" by Black Lace. The success of the commercial prompted several more in this series:\n\n\n\"Frosted Mini-Wheats\" currently come in the following varieties:\nThe following varieties have been discontinued\n\nFrosted Mini-Wheats contains whole grain wheat, sugar and gelatin. Since Frosted Mini-Wheats contains gelatin, it is not vegetarian (gelatin is made from collagen which comes from animal bones and fat). By 2012, brown rice sugar was added to the list of ingredients.\n\nThere was a voluntary recall of certain Frosted Mini-Wheats products in October 2012 due to possible presence of metal fragments from a faulty Kellogg's manufacturing plant.\n\n"}

The original packaging used the phrase \"Ayds Reducing Plan vitamin and mineral Candy\"; a later version used the phrase \"appetite suppressant candy\". The active ingredient was originally benzocaine, presumably to reduce the sense of taste to reduce eating, later changed in the candy (as reported by \"The New York Times\") to phenylpropanolamine. \n\nBy the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease. While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market.\n\nThe product was originally introduced by the Carlay Company of Chicago.

Supported by the local communities of Guam, it is primarily conducted from Andersen Air Force Base and Yokota Air Base, and targets Micronesia.\n\nThe operation was first conducted in 1952. Then, the aircrew of a WB-29 aircraft assigned to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, formerly assigned to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, was flying a mission to the south of Guam over the Micronesian atoll of Kapingamarangi. When they saw the islanders waving to them, the crew quickly gathered some items they had on the plane, placed them in a container with a parachute attached and dropped the cargo as they circled again. \n\nA witness to the first drop on the island of Agrigan said \"We saw these things come out of the back of the airplane and I was yelling: 'There are toys coming down'\". At the time the island had no electricity or running water, and the islands were periodically hit by typhoons. Some of the first containers failed to arrive where intended, and islanders swam out to retrieve some, while others were discovered months later some miles away.\n\nToday this unique Christmas tradition is continued with the donations from the residents and businesses of Guam.

The operation gives troops the chance to practice humanitarian aid drops, as the troops will later be expected to conduct drops over Iraq or Afghanistan after deployment.\n\nVolunteers from Andersen Air Force Base, including 734th Air Mobility Squadron, and both crew and aircraft from the 36th Airlift Squadron at Yokota Air Base, Japan, participate in the operation. Members of the Guam community also help the operation. Money is raised for the operation by sponsored activities such as golf tournaments and sponsored runs, as well as local businesses sponsoring individual boxes.\n\nThe 2006 operation saw 140 boxes dropped to 59 islands. The 2011 operation included dropping twenty five boxes of IV fluids to Fais Island in order to combat a local outbreak of dengue fever.

Around the 16th century, buckwheat began to be processed into thin noodles. This method was originally known as \"soba-kiri\" (lit. soba cutting) but it was later abbreviated into \"soba\". Note that soba was mainly consumed in eastern Japan. It was not popular in western Japan including Okinawa. Buckwheat noodles remain rare in Okinawa, where they are known as \"Nihon soba\" (Japanese soba) or \"kuroi soba\" (black soba).\n\nIn modern Japan, the meaning of \"soba\" was extended so that it could refer to other types of thin noodles. Yakisoba (stir-fried noodles) contain no buckwheat. \"Shina soba\", commonly known as \"Chūka soba\" or rāmen today, is also made from wheat flour. Okinawa soba falls into this category and is made entirely from wheat.\n\nUnder a fair competition regulation, soba was standardized as \"the noodles contain at least 30% of buckwheat.\" This definition caused a problem when Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. In 1976, the Fair Trade Commission tried to make Okinawa Prefecture drop the name \"soba\" because Okinawa's soba did not conform to the regulation. The Okinawa Noodle Manufacturing Co-op negotiated with the Fair Trade Commission and, as a result, it was accepted as one of several exceptions, under the name of \"Okinawa soba\".\n\nSome attempt to trace the origin of Okinawa soba back to the Ryūkyū Kingdom period. It is pointed out that Chinese delegates possibly brought wheat noodles to the royal court. However, they fail to establish a link to the modern Okinawan cuisine.\n\nThe first known documented reference to Okinawa soba is of 1902 or the late Meiji period. At that time, it was known as \"Shina soba\" (Chinese \"soba\") as in mainland Japan. Several soba restaurants are known to have run in Naha in the Taishō period. They used to have close links with the red-light district. Soba restaurants were destroyed by U.S. attacks during the Battle of Okinawa. Its revival began in U.S. internment camps where wheat rations were supplied. In the 1960s soba was popularized with the introduction of noodle making machines. The popularization was accompanied by the transformation from a restaurant meal to home cooking. The mainland Japanese custom of eating soba on New Year's Eve was introduced to Okinawa in 1968 but buckwheat noodles were replaced by wheat noodles. Today Okinawa soba is considered as a vital part of traditional Okinawan culture although folklorist Nishimura Hidemi argued that it was an invented tradition.\nCurrently, the soba has been adopted as a local tradition in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, due to the large Okinawan-descendent population in the 850,000 inhabitants city.\nIt’s usual to find specialized restaurants along the city, serving a local adaptation of the dish, due to the originally difficulty of finding sea fish in that western region of Brazil. Nowadays, it became a local version of the Soba.\n\n"}
{"id": "3969082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3969082", "title": "Lamian", "text": "Lamian\n\nLamian is a type of Chinese noodle. Lamian is made by twisting, stretching and folding the dough into strands, using the weight of the dough. The length and thickness of the strands depends on the number of times the dough is folded. This unique method of making noodles originated in China. The \"Songshi Yangsheng Bu\" (), which was written by Song Xu and dates back to 1504, has the earliest description of the method to make lamian.\n\nThe hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce many strands of thin, long noodle. Literally, \"lā,\" (拉) means to pull or stretch, while \"miàn\" (simplified: 面/traditional: 麵) means noodle.\n\nThere are several styles of twisting the dough but they all employ the same concept: a piece of dough is repeatedly stretched and folded onto itself in order to align the glutens and warm up the dough for stretching. Then it is rolled out to a workable thickness and cut into workable portions. The end pieces of the starting dough are never used because the glutens are not as aligned as the middle pieces.\n\nThis dough is then pulled to about an arm span's length. The puller then makes a loop with the dough, joining the two ends into one clump of dough, and inserts his fingers into the loop to keep the strand from sticking to itself. Doing this, the pull has doubled the length of the dough while fractioning its thickness. This process is repeated several times until the desired thickness and quantity is achieved. Some pullers dip the strands into flour between stretching phases to keep them separated. When flour is used, there generally is a final slap of noodles against the prep board to remove excess flour.\n\nIn the Lanzhou style, the dough is worked aggressively. It is pulled in straight, quick, tugs with no twisting or waving. Some pullers regularly slam the noodle against their prep boards to ensure even stretching and uniform thickness. Flour is sometimes used to dust the strands and prevent sticking.\n\nIn the Beijing style of preparation, the dough is twisted, stretched delicately by waving the arms and body, untwisted, looped to double the strands, and then repeated. When stretching, they coordinate waving their torso and arms to increase the potential length of the noodle beyond that of the puller's arm span. Flour dusting is more liberally employed in this style than in the Lanzhou style of preparation.\n\nThere is also another style, in which the noodle maker stretches one thick, flat strand of dough between two hands. This is usually done for show and involves the puller twirling and spinning much like Chinese ribbon dancing.\n\nDishes using lamian are usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup called \"tangmian\" ( literally 'soup noodles'). However, they are sometimes stir-fried and served with a sauce as a dish called \"chaomian\" (, literally 'fried noodles.' (This word is etymologically related to chow mein though the dish itself is different).\n\nSmall restaurants serving Lanzhou-style lamian are very common throughout western China where they have formed a staple diet for centuries, as well as eastern Chinese cities. They tend to serve a variety of low cost meals, with a choice of lamian, \"daoxiaomian\" () and perhaps Xi'an-style \"paomo\" (steamed bread dipped in soup). Noodles may be served with beef or mutton, either in soup or stir-fried. Lamian can also be served cold with salad ingredients such as shredded cucumber and tomato to make a refreshing summer dish.\n\nMany of the lamian restaurants are owned by Hui ethnic families from Northwestern China, and serve only halal food (thus no pork dishes). Lamian restaurants are the most common halal restaurants in eastern China.\n\nAnother typical variety of \"lamian\" is Shandong lamian, from the eastern province of Shandong.\n\nSingapore sports 'lamian' restaurants, however the taste may be alien to those accustomed to Chinese lanzhou lamian, as the ingredients are often altered to suit local tastes which are distinctly south-eastern Chinese. There are nevertheless lamian restaurants in Singapore serving tastes similar if not identical to lanzhou lamian, particularly if run by Chinese migrants.\n\nIn New York's Manhattan and Sunset Park Chinatowns, lamian restaurants are a common sight. Most are run by Fuzhounese, some featuring knife cut noodles, but most featuring only the hand-cut versions. Some call themselves \"Lanzhou Lamian\" restaurants, others are just called \"Lamian\" restaurants. In Manhattan Chinatown, most are located in the Fuzhounese area of Chinatown east of Bowery, while in Sunset Park, sometime referred to as Fuzhou Town, they are scattered along the 8th Avenue strip.\n\nLamian restaurants are increasingly found in Australia's chinatowns and beyond. Most are run by non-Hui, non-Muslim Chinese migrants from mainland China and therefore differ from the typical Muslim 'lamian' restaurants in China, as the meat will not be halal and ingredients such as pork are offered. Whilst in China lamian restaurants are typically cheap in comparison to other local food, in Australia the price of lamian restaurant meals is on par with other Chinese and local food varieties. Whilst in China lamian restaurants are advertised as 'Lanzhou' lamian, regardless of whether the recipes and staff are from Lanzhou, in Australia one finds non-Lanzhou lamian advertised, such as Xi'an lamian and Xinjiang lamian.\n\nManila, Cebu and Davao's Chinatowns have Chinese restaurants serving lamian. Additionally, the Filipino version of noodles, locally called Pancit Canton, is a popular Filipino dish.\nFrankfurt am Main has Chinese restaurants located near the main station that specialize in serving lamian.\n\n"}

Established on 17 April 1913, the oldest beer-producing factory in Iceland. Annually, it produces 45 million liters of beverages.\n\nThe company was established on 17 April 1913 by Tómas Tómasson, who began production of a (1% alc/vol) beverage, malt extract. Today it's the oldest beer-producing factory in Iceland; and now it's also a wholesaler of food and beverages. At first, the operations of Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson were based in two bedrooms in the basement of the Þórshamar house at Templarasund in Reykjavik, which Tómas had leased. Today, this house is owned by the Icelandic parliament (Althing). A year later, the company moved to the Thomsen house at Tryggvagata, and with this, the operating area grew significantly.\n\nThe scope of operations was not large at first. The brewing boiler was only 65 litres, and bottles were closed by pushing the cap onto the bottle with a flat palm and binding it with wire. During the first production year, Ölgerðin sold around 38 thousand litres, mostly malt extract and white beer. The light beer Egils Pilsner came to market in the same year, as the ban on alcohol was implemented in 1915, after which it was illegal to produce alcoholic beer with more than 2.25% alcohol content. Generally, brewmasters from Germany and Denmark were hired to oversee the beer production. The company also produces soft drinks (e.g. Egils Appelsín).\n\nTómas Tómasson went to Copenhagen in 1915 to learn brewing at the Bryggeriet Stjernen and then in Germany, where he spent the next two years. Returning home in 1917, he bought his first building on Njálsgata on the crossroads between Njálsgata, Frakkastigur and Grettisgata, which was later renamed \"Ölgerðartorfan\". The company was located there for much of the 20th century. In the years 1924–1928, both a brewery and a yeast cellar were in use there. He built up a comprehensive brewery, fermentation and bottling facility.\n\nIn 1926, Ölgerðin sold a million bottles in one year. In the same year, Danish King Christian X made an official visit to Iceland. Subsequently, Ölgerðin was given the right to call themselves the \"royal brewery\".\n\nThe production of Egils Pilsner began in 1916; while the company claimed 1917 on the bottle for years. The company was the first to receive an exemption for the production of alcoholic beer in Iceland during the war, when it produced the Polar Ale for the British occupation forces. From 1951, Ölgerðin produced the Polar Beer for the US military base in Keflavik and then Export Beer, which the general population called Egils strong. After the beer ban was lifted in 1989, the brewery’s main product was Egils Gull.\n\nThe production of soda drinks began in 1930, and Ölgerðin bought the soda drink factories Síríus and Kaldá. Ölgerðin was made into a corporation two years later and was merged with Ölgerðin Þór hf., which had been operating for two years. Þór had built a brewery at Rauðarárstígur, but it was closed during the merger. In 1955, Egils Appelsín (orange soda) was introduced. Sigurður Sveinsson, an employee of Ölgerðin created a recipe that was immediately appreciated by locals and has since then surpassed all other such drinks. \n\nAfter Tómas died in 1978, in his nineties, his sons, Jóhannes and Tómas Agnar ran Ölgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson for almost a quarter of a century. In 2000, they decided to sell the family’s share, and an agreement was reached at the end of the year with Íslandsbanki-FBA and the investment company Gilding. There was a change in ownership in April 2002, when Lind ehf., a subsidiary of Danól ehf., bought Ölgerðin. The operations of Lind and Ölgerðin were merged in the beginning of that year, and with this merger, the product availability of Ölgerðin increased substantially. In 2007, Októ Einarsson and Andri Þór Guðmundsson acquired Ölgerðin with Kaupthing bank, which later sold its shares to several bank executives.\n\nÖlgerðin Egill Skallagrímsson produces 45 million litres of beverages every year, of which 10 million litres are brewed in the brewing boiler.\n\nEgils Gull earned the \"World’s Best Standard Lager\" at the World Beer Awards 2011 and Bríó won the best German-style Pilsner at the 2012 World Beer Cup.\n\n\n"}

The class of deterministic pushdown automata accepts the deterministic context-free languages, a proper subset of context-free languages.\n\nMachine transitions are based on the current state and input symbol, and also the current topmost symbol of the stack. Symbols lower in the stack are not visible and have no immediate effect. Machine actions include pushing, popping, or replacing the stack top. A deterministic pushdown automaton has at most one legal transition for the same combination of input symbol, state, and top stack symbol. This is where it differs from the nondeterministic pushdown automaton.\n\nA (not necessarily deterministic) PDA formula_1 can be defined as a 7-tuple:\n\nwhere\n\n\n\"M\" is \"deterministic\" if it satisfies both the following conditions:\n\nThere are two possible acceptance criteria: acceptance by \"empty stack\" and acceptance by \"final state\". The two are not equivalent for the deterministic pushdown automaton (although they are for the non-deterministic pushdown automaton). The languages accepted by \"empty stack\" are those languages that are accepted by \"final state\" and are prefix-free: no word in the language is the prefix of another word in the language.\n\nThe usual acceptance criterion is \"final state\", and it is this acceptance criterion which is used to define the deterministic context-free languages.\n\nIf formula_25 is a language accepted by a PDA formula_9, it can also be accepted by a DPDA if and only if there is a single computation from the initial configuration until an accepting one for all strings belonging to formula_25. If formula_25 can be accepted by a PDA it is a context free language and if it can be accepted by a DPDA it is a deterministic context-free language.\n\nNot all context-free languages are deterministic. This makes the DPDA a strictly weaker device than the PDA. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.\n\nRestricting the DPDA to a single state reduces the class of languages accepted to the LL(1) languages. In the case of a PDA, this restriction has no effect on the class of languages accepted.\n\nClosure properties of deterministic context-free languages (accepted by deterministic PDA by final state) are drastically different from the context-free languages. As an example they are (effectively) closed under complementation, but not closed under union. To prove that the complement of a language accepted by a deterministic PDA is also accepted by a deterministic PDA is tricky. In principle one has to avoid infinite computations.\n\nAs a consequence of the complementation it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for emptiness. This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).\n\nGéraud Sénizergues (1997) proved that the equivalence problem for deterministic PDA (i.e. given two deterministic PDA A and B, is L(A)=L(B)?) is decidable, a proof that earned him the 2002 Gödel Prize. For nondeterministic PDA, equivalence is undecidable.\n\n\n \n"}

It can be drunk pure or as part of a mix. The colour is medium brown.\n\nPlantiac is a Dutch distilled drink based on molasses-alcohol, with added essences and extracts to produce its characteristic taste. The aromas used in the production of Plantiac are purchased from Quest International and IFF. The exact ingredients are kept secret - they are what make each Vieux unique. However, the essences and extracts used for Plantiac include fusel oil, amyl alcohols, vanilla, esters, prune extract and the concentrated liquids that can be obtained from the roots of the liquorice plant (\"Glycyrrhiza glabra\", Dutch \"zoethoutwortel\"). Whereas so-called eau-de-vie (or other grape-based extracts) is sometimes used during the production of Dutch Brandy, this does not happen when Plantiac is made.\n\nIt contains 35% alcohol. The brown colour of Plantiac is obtained using caramel.\n\nIt is not certain when Plantiac was first made. Although advertisements insist on a 100-year anniversary in 1970 this is not true. Plantiac was first produced as Plantinga Cognac by the Plantinga distillery in Bolsward, Netherlands, most likely in the 1930s or 1940s. The 100-year anniversary seems to refer, rather, to the Plantinga company as a whole.\n\nAlthough the Treaty of Versailles (1919) already forbade use of the name “Cognac” from being used for products produced outside of the French Cognac region, Dutch Brandy (including Plantinga Cognac) continued to be sold under the Cognac name until the 1960s. The packaging (including stars) was clearly derived from Cognac packaging. Pressure from the French government led to a law that then definitely no longer allowed for the name “Cognac” to be used. It was ratified by the Dutch Supreme Court in a Trade Treaty with France on 1 June 1956.\n\nDutch Brandy producers decided upon the name “Vieux”, which had already been used before - it is French for “old” and was often used to describe Old Dutch Brandy (“Cognac Vieux”) – and which did not provide any pronunciation difficulties. Around that time, Gerrit Herman Plantinga (born 1929, son of Louwrens Baltus Plantinga (1902-1993), who was son of Gerrit Herman Plantinga (1876-1962), who was in turn son of Klaas Plantinga, founder of the Plantinga distillery) thought up the Plantiac name. He and some of his colleagues working at Philips' Natlab constructed it from the family name (\"Planti-\") and the name 'cognac' (\"-ac\"). The Plantiac name was first seen used in a 1961 advertisement, although that year also saw advertisements still using the name \"Plantinga's Cognac Vieux\". Plantiac became an official registered trademark on 8 April 1971.\n\nUntil 1972, Plantiac (and before that, Plantinga Cognac) was produced in Bolsward. From 1972 to 2004, it was produced by the UTO company (since 2011 renamed to Herman Jansen) in Schiedam, also in the Netherlands. There, it was bottled about once per month. Since July 2004, Plantiac has been produced under exclusive licence from the Herman Jansen company by Boomsma in Leeuwarden, Netherlands.\n\nPlantiac has been made available in 40 cc, 50 cc, 200 cc, 500 cc and 1000 cc bottles. As of 2004, it is only bottled in 200 cc and 1000 cc quantities.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Plantiac enjoyed a brief period of Atari ST scene popularity.\n\n"}

The use of thanaka has also spread to neighbouring countries including Thailand. \n\nIt is not similar to the Bindi worn by the Indian women orTilaka worn by Indians of either gender.It is similar to Chandan.\n\nThe earliest literary reference to thanaka is in a 14th-century poem written by King Razadarit's Mon-speaking consort. Mentions of thanaka also exist in the 15th-century literary works of Burmese monk-poet Shin Maharatthasara (1486-1529).\n\nThe wood of several trees may be used to produce thanaka cream; these trees grow abundantly in central Myanmar. They include principally \"Murraya spp. (thanaka) \" but also \"Limonia acidissima\" (\"theethee\" or wood apple). The two most popular are \"Shwebo thanaka\" from Sagaing Region and \"Shinmadaung thanaka\" from Magway Region. A more recent contender sold as a paste is Taunggyi \"Maukme thanaka\" from southern Shan State. Thanaka trees are perennials, and a tree must be at least 35 years old before it is considered mature enough to yield good-quality cuttings. Thanaka in its natural state is sold as small logs individually or in bundles, but nowadays also available as a paste or in powder form.\n\nThanaka cream is made by grinding the bark, wood, or roots of a thanaka tree with a small amount of water on a circular slate slab called \"kyauk pyin\", which has a channel around the rim for the water to drain into.\n\nThanaka cream has been used by Burmese women for over 2000 years. It has a fragrant scent somewhat similar to sandalwood. The creamy paste is applied to the face in attractive designs, the most common form being a circular patch on each cheek, nose, sometimes made stripey with the fingers known as \"thanaka bè gya\", or patterned in the shape of a leaf, often also highlighting the bridge of the nose with it at the same time. It may be applied from head to toe (\"thanaka chi zoun gaung zoun\"). Apart from cosmetic beauty, thanaka also gives a cooling sensation and provides protection from sunburn. It is believed to help remove acne and promote smooth skin. It is also an anti-fungal. The active ingredients of thanaka are coumarin and marmesin.\n\n"}

They are designed as a high-end pogo stick, capable of jumping to extreme heights and enabling riders to perform a wide variety of tricks.\n\nThere are a variety of advantages in using an air-powered pogo stick, ranging from adjustable spring tensions to overall weight to power ratio.\n\nThe air spring within a Vurtego pogo stick allows riders to pump the pogo stick up to their own preferred air pressure in order to jump. The more air pressure that is pumped into the pogo stick, the stiffer the spring becomes. The same Vurtego pogo stick can be used by a 75 lb kid or a 300 lb fully grown adult, simply by adjusting the air pressure. Due to the air spring that is used in the Vurtego's pogo sticks, there is no maximum weight limit.\n\nAn air spring has advantages over other forms of pogo stick propulsion. An air spring weighs just about nothing compared to a traditional coil spring and is capable of far more power in relation to the overall weight of the spring. A metal spring capable of propelling a rider more than five feet in the air would need to weigh more than 30 pounds and is therefore infeasible. Elastomeric bands, which are used in a few pogo sticks available today, tend to degrade or break over time.\n\nVurtego pogo sticks weigh under 11 pounds (5 kg) and is capable of producing 1500 pounds-force (8,000 newtons) of thrust.\n\nIn January 2006 Vurtego released its first pogo stick, the V1. The V1 was the first air-powered extreme pogo stick ever sold and was capable of jumping more than seven feet high. The V1 utilized a custom extruded plastic cylinder body, billet aluminum footpegs, a non-rotating stainless steel shaft, and a nylon piston. \nIn 2008 Vurtego released a new version of the Vurtego, the 'V2.' The V2 is similar to the V1, except the shaft is rotated 45 degrees, adding strength. The pegs are larger and curved a bit at the bottom. There is a less expensive version of the V2, known as the 'power pogo', which boasts the same performance as the V2, but is made in China with cheaper material. Another version known as the V2 'Fit' is, as the name suggests, for exercise. The V2 comes in three sizes; Small [riders 5'0\"-5'6\"], Medium [5'4\"-6'0\"], and Large [5'10\"+].\n\nThe next edition to the Vurtego series, known as the V3, became available in late 2009. The V3 is similar to a V2 but has an aluminum tube and a new boltless air piston. There were two versions, the standard V3 [grey anodized aluminum] and a black version known as the 'V3 Stealth'. The stealth version features an all black anodized aluminum tube and footpegs with the same performance as the standard V3. The V3 comes in the three sizes.\n\nIn late 2015 Vurtego's latest pogo stick, the V4, was introduced. The V4 was the first major redesign since the V1. The entire design of the V4 was centered around the new Air Piston, which combined the spacer and piston designs from the V1-V3 in order to increase air volume by 10%. This additional air volume creates a smoother, softer bounce that feels very similar to a trampoline. The V4 jumps higher with less effort than its predecessors. In order to reduce friction during the bounce a smaller o-ring seal and new bushing were implemented. A much harder, 90a urethane donut with sound dampening nubs was integrated into the design, and four additional breather holes were added to the cylinder in order to increase the air flow. The stroke was extended by 1\" on the V4 and 3\" on the V4 Pro, allowing for riders to jump higher without bottoming out the stroke. The last major update was a round Grip Tip, which provides the same amount of surface area no matter what angle a rider lands at. The V4 is offered in white, and the V4 Pro is offered in a bright green.\n\nAll of Vurtego's pogo sticks are offered in three different sizes:\nSmall - 4'8\" - 5'3\" (147 cm - 161 cm) | 10 lbs (4.54 kg)\nMedium - 5'4\" - 5'11\" (162 cm - 181 cm) | 10.5 lbs (4.76 kg)\nLarge - 6' - 6'6\" (182 cm - 198 cm) | 11 lbs (5 kg)\n\nVurtego pogo sticks currently hold 8 world records.\n\n11 feet 1/2 inch - set by Biff Hutchison in 2016\n\n9 feet 1 inch - set by Michael Mena in 2014\n\n18 - set by Dmitry Arsenyev in 2015\n\n7:40 - set by Drew McQuiston in 2017 \n\n8 - set by Henry Cabelus in 2016\n\n15 - set by a bunch of people in 2015\n\n38 - set by Henry Cabelus in 2016\n\n266 - set by Tone Staubs in 2013\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3984833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3984833", "title": "Ripple (electrical)", "text": "Ripple (electrical)\n\nRipple (specifically ripple voltage) in electronics is the residual periodic variation of the DC voltage within a power supply which has been derived from an alternating current (AC) source. This ripple is due to incomplete suppression of the alternating waveform after rectification. Ripple voltage originates as the output of a rectifier or from generation and commutation of DC power.\n\nRipple (specifically ripple current or surge current) may also refer to the pulsed current consumption of non-linear devices like capacitor-input rectifiers.\n\nAs well as these time-varying phenomena, there is a frequency domain ripple that arises in some classes of filter and other signal processing networks. In this case the periodic variation is a variation in the insertion loss of the network against increasing frequency. The variation may not be strictly linearly periodic. In this meaning also, ripple is usually to be considered an incidental effect, its existence being a compromise between the amount of ripple and other design parameters.\n\nRipple is wasted power, and has many undesirable effects in a DC circuit: it heats components, causes noise and distortion, and may cause digital circuits to operate improperly. Ripple may be reduced by an electronic filter, and eliminated by a voltage regulator.\n\nA non-ideal DC voltage waveform can be viewed as a composite of a constant DC component (offset) with an alternating (AC) voltage—the ripple voltage—overlaid. The ripple component is often small in magnitude relative to the DC component, but in absolute terms, ripple (as in the case of HVDC transmission systems) may be thousands of volts. Ripple itself is a composite (non-sinusoidal) waveform consisting of harmonics of some fundamental frequency which is usually the AC line frequency of 50/60 Hz, but in the case of switched-mode power supplies, the fundamental frequency can be tens of kilohertz to megahertz. The characteristics and components of ripple depend on its source: there is single-phase half- and full-wave rectification, and three-phase half- and full-wave rectification. Rectification can be controlled (uses Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) or uncontrolled (uses diodes). There is in addition, active rectification which uses transistors.\n\nVarious properties of ripple voltage may be important depending on application: the equation of the ripple for Fourier analysis to determine the constituent harmonics; the peak (usually peak-to-peak) value of the voltage; the root mean square (RMS) value of the voltage which is a component of power transmitted; the ripple factor \"γ\", the ratio of RMS value to DC voltage output; the conversion ratio (also called the rectification ratio or \"efficiency\") \"η\", the ratio of DC output power to AC input power; and form-factor, the ratio of the RMS value of the output voltage to the average value of the output voltage. Analogous ratios for output ripple current may also be computed.\n\nAn electronic filter with high impedance at the ripple frequency may be used to reduce ripple voltage and increase or decrease DC output; such a filter is often called a smoothing filter.\n\nThe initial step in AC to DC conversion is to send the AC current through a rectifier. The ripple voltage output is very large in this situation; the peak-to-peak ripple voltage is equal to the peak AC voltage minus the forward voltage of the rectifier diodes. In the case of a SS silicon diode, the forward voltage is 0.7V; for vacuum tube rectifiers, forward voltage usually ranges between 25 and 67V (5R4). The output voltage is a sine wave with the negative half-cycles inverted. The equation is:\n\nThe Fourier expansion of the function is:\n\nSeveral relevant properties are apparent on inspection of the Fourier series:\n\nThe output voltages are:\n\nwhere\n\nThe ripple factor is:\n\nThe form factor is:\n\nThe peak factor is: \nThe conversion ratio is:\n\nThe transformer utilization factor is:\n\nReducing ripple is only one of several principal considerations in power supply filter design. The filtering of ripple voltage is analogous to filtering other kinds of signals. However, in AC/DC power conversion as well as DC power generation, high voltages and currents or both may be output as ripple. Therefore, large discrete components like high ripple-current rated electrolytic capacitors, large iron-core chokes and wire-wound power resistors are best suited to reduce ripple to manageable proportions before passing the current to an IC component like a voltage regulator, or on to the load. The kind of filtering required depends on the amplitude of the various harmonics of the ripple and the demands of the load. For example, a moving coil (MC) input circuit of a phono preamplifier may require that ripple be reduced to no more than a few hundred nanovolts (10V). In contrast, a battery charger, being a wholly resistive circuit, does not require any ripple filtering. Since the desired output is direct current (essentially 0 Hz), ripple filters are usually configured as low pass filters characterized by shunt capacitors and series chokes. Series resistors may replace chokes for reducing the output DC voltage, and shunt resistors may be used for voltage regulation.\n\nMost power supplies are now switched mode designs. The filtering requirements for such power supplies are much easier to meet owing to the high frequency of the ripple waveform. The ripple frequency in switch-mode power supplies is not related to the line frequency, but is instead a multiple of the frequency of the chopper circuit, which is usually in the range of 50 kHz - 1Mhz.\nA capacitor input filter (in which the first component is a shunt capacitor) and choke input filter (which has a series choke as the first component) can both reduce ripple, but have opposing effects on voltage and current, and the choice between them depends on the characteristics of the load. Capacitor input filters have poor voltage regulation, so are preferred for use in circuits with stable loads and low currents (because low currents reduce ripple here). Choke input filters are preferred for circuits with variable loads and high currents (since a choke outputs a stable voltage and higher current means less ripple in this case).\n\nThe number of reactive components in a filter is called its \"order\". Each reactive component reduces signal strength by 6db/octave above (or below for a high-pass filter) the corner frequency of the filter, so that a 2nd-order low-pass filter for example, reduces signal strength by 12db/octave above the corner frequency. Resistive components (including resistors and parasitic elements like DCR of chokes and ESR of capacitors) also reduce signal strength, but their effect is \"linear\", and does not vary with frequency.\n\nA common arrangement is to allow the rectifier to work into a large smoothing capacitor which acts as a reservoir. After a peak in output voltage the capacitor (C) supplies the current to the load (R) and continues to do so until the capacitor voltage has fallen to the value of the now rising next half-cycle of rectified voltage. At that point the rectifier conducts again and delivers current to the reservoir until peak voltage is again reached.\n\nIf the RC time constant is large in comparison to the period of the AC waveform, then a reasonably accurate approximation can be made by assuming that the capacitor voltage falls linearly. A further useful assumption can be made if the ripple is small compared to the DC voltage. In this case the phase angle through which the rectifier conducts will be small and it can be assumed that the capacitor is discharging all the way from one peak to the next with little loss of accuracy.\nWith the above assumptions the peak-to-peak ripple voltage can be calculated as:\n\nThe definition of capacitance formula_16and current formula_17are\n\nwhere formula_19is the amount of charge. The current and time formula_20is taken from start of capacitor discharge until the minimum voltage on a full wave rectified signal as shown on the figure to the right. The time formula_21would then be equal to half the period of the full wave input.\n\nCombining the three equations above to determine formula_23 gives,\n\nThus, for a full-wave rectifier:\n\nwhere\n\nFor the rms value of the ripple voltage, the calculation is more involved as the shape of the ripple waveform has a bearing on the result. Assuming a sawtooth waveform is a similar assumption to the ones above. The RMS value of a sawtooth wave is formula_29 where formula_30 is peak voltage. With the further approximation that formula_30 is formula_32, it yields the result:\n\nwhere\n\nAnother approach to reducing ripple is to use a series choke. A choke has a filtering action and consequently produces a smoother waveform with fewer high-order harmonics. Against this, the DC output is close to the average input voltage as opposed to the voltage with the reservoir capacitor which is close to the peak input voltage. Starting with the Fourier term for the second harmonic, and ignoring higher-order harmonics,\n\nthe ripple factor is given by:\n\nFor formula_40\nThis is a little less than 0.483 because higher-order harmonics were omitted from consideration. (See Inductance.)\n\nThere is a minimum inductance which is relative to the resistance of the load required in order for a series choke to continuously conduct current. If the inductance falls below that value, current will be intermittent and output DC voltage will rise from the average input voltage to the peak input voltage - in effect, the inductor will behave like a capacitor. That minimum inductance, called the \"critical inductance\" is formula_42 where R is the load resistance and f the line frequency. This gives values of L = R/1131 (often stated as R/1130) for 60 Hz mains rectification, and L = R/942 for 50 Hz mains rectification. Additionally, interrupting current to an inductor will cause its magnetic flux to collapse exponentially; as current falls, a voltage spike composed of very high harmonics results which can damage other components of the power supply or circuit. This phenomenon is called flyback voltage.\n\nThe complex impedance of a series choke is effectively part of the load impedance, so that lightly loaded circuits have increased ripple (just the opposite of a capacitor input filter). For that reason, a choke input filter is almost always part of an LC filter section, whose ripple reduction is independent of load current. The ripple factor is:\n\nwhere \n\nIn high voltage/low current circuits, a resistor may replace the series choke in an LC filter section (creating an RC filter section). This has the effect of reducing the DC output as well as ripple. The ripple factor is\n\nwhere \n\nSimilarly because of the independence of LC filter sections with respect to load, a reservoir capacitor is also commonly followed by one resulting in a low-pass Π-filter. A Π-filter results in a much lower ripple factor than a capacitor or choke input filter alone. It may be followed by additional LC or RC filter sections to further reduce ripple to a level tolerable by the load. However, use of chokes is deprecated in contemporary designs for economic reasons.\n\nA more common solution where good ripple rejection is required is to use a reservoir capacitor to reduce the ripple to something manageable and then pass the current through a voltage regulator circuit. The regulator circuit, as well as providing a stable output voltage, will incidentally filter out nearly all of the ripple as long as the minimum level of the ripple waveform does not go below the voltage being regulated to. Switched-mode power supplies usually include a voltage regulator as part of the circuit.\n\nVoltage regulation is based on a different principle than filtering: it relies on the peak inverse voltage of a diode or series of diodes to set a maximum output voltage; it may also use one or more voltage amplification devices like transistors to boost voltage during sags. Because of the non-linear characteristics of these devices, the output of a regulator is free of ripple. A simple voltage regulator may be made with a series resistor to drop voltage followed by a shunt zener diode whose Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) sets the maximum output voltage; if voltage rises, the diode shunts away current to maintain regulation.\n\nRipple is undesirable in many electronic applications for a variety of reasons:\n\nRipple current is a periodic non-sinusoidal waveform derived from an AC power source characterized by high amplitude narrow bandwidth pulses.\nThe pulses coincide with peak or near peak amplitude of an accompanying sinusoidal voltage waveform.\n\nRipple current results in increased dissipation in parasitic resistive portions of circuits like ESR of capacitors, DCR of transformers and inductors, internal resistance of storage batteries. The dissipation is proportional to the current squared times resistance ( IR ). The RMS value of ripple current can be many times the RMS of the load current.\n\nRipple in the context of the frequency domain refers to the periodic variation in insertion loss with frequency of a filter or some other two-port network. Not all filters exhibit ripple, some have monotonically increasing insertion loss with frequency such as the Butterworth filter. Common classes of filter which exhibit ripple are the Chebyshev filter, inverse Chebyshev filter and the Elliptical filter. The ripple is not usually strictly linearly periodic as can be seen from the example plot. Other examples of networks exhibiting ripple are impedance matching networks that have been designed using Chebyshev polynomials. The ripple of these networks, unlike regular filters, will never reach 0 dB at minimum loss if designed for optimum transmission across the passband as a whole.\n\nThe amount of ripple can be traded for other parameters in the filter design. For instance, the rate of roll-off from the passband to the stopband can be increased at the expense of increasing the ripple without increasing the order of the filter (that is, the number of components has stayed the same). On the other hand, the ripple can be reduced by increasing the order of the filter while at the same time maintaining the same rate of roll-off.\n\n\n"}

It more closely resembles a sloppy joe, without the tomato-based sauce.\n\nCarroll Dietz of Missoula, Montana, created the precursor to the tavern sandwich in 1920, referred to as a \"steamed hamburger.\" In 1926, Fred Angell began selling his version of the sandwich at the first Maid-Rite restaurant in Muscatine, Iowa, under the name \"loose meat sandwich.\" The name \"tavern\" for the sandwich is credited to David Heglin. Heglin sold the sandwiches at his Sioux City, Iowa, restaurant in 1924. After Heglin died, Abe Kaled bought the business in 1934 and renamed the restaurant Ye Olde Tavern after the sandwich. Kaled perfected the recipe for the ground beef, and the tavern sandwich spread to restaurants and bars across the Sioux City area.\n\nThe sandwich is now well known throughout the Midwestern United States, and is served not only in small, local establishments but also in franchise restaurant locations such as Dairy Queen and Maid-Rite. The Wichita, Kansas-based chain Nu Way Cafe serves a version of the tavern/loose meat sandwich called a \"Nu Way\". In Illinois, the sandwich is also known as a \"loose hamburger sandwich\". In Iowa, it is sometimes referred to as a Maid-Rite.\n\nIn later seasons of the American sitcom \"Roseanne\", Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Barr) co-owns a restaurant called the \"Lanford Lunch Box\" in the fictional town of Lanford, Illinois, which specializes in loose meat sandwiches. The inspiration for Lunch Box was a real-life restaurant called Canteen Lunch in the Alley in Ottumwa, Iowa. In 1993, Roseanne and then-husband Tom Arnold opened Roseanne and Tom's Big Food Diner (based on the fictional Lanford Lunchbox) in Eldon, Iowa (less than 20 miles southeast of Ottumwa's Canteen Lunch), also specializing in loose meat sandwiches.\n\nIowa's loose meat sandwich figures in \"The Good Wife\", season 7, episode 11, in which a presidential candidate completing the Full Grassley is forced to eat a loose meat sandwich at each stop.\n\n\n"}

Sliced boiled eggs or egg salad are popular options. In the latter case, it may be called an egg salad sandwich.\n\nBeyond the basic model of fried egg between slices of bread, many common sandwiches have variations that include a fried egg in addition to bacon, sausage, cheese, black pudding, cold cuts, or as another topping to a hamburger. A popular breakfast sandwich in New Jersey consists of a fried egg, pork roll, and American cheese on a roll. The Southern egg sandwich is an egg and cheese sandwich, with bacon and avocado as additions. \n\nA popular filling snack with British troops since at least World War I, the \"egg banjo\" is a sandwich of a runny fried egg between two thick slices of bread (if possible, buttered or with margarine), often accompanied by a mug of \"gunfire\". A popular account of the term's origins is the act of cleaning spilt egg off one's body, the sandwich held out to the side with one hand whilst the other wipes at the drips, giving the impression of playing an invisible banjo.\n\nA 1905 British cookbook describes an \"egg sandwich\" made with sliced hard-boiled eggs, marinated in oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and garnished with minced watercress. An \"egg and chutney sandwich\" is made from chutney and minced hard-boiled eggs; an \"egg cream\" sandwich from hard-boiled eggs pounded into a smooth paste and seasoned with anchovies and mustard. A common alternative is to mash the hard-boiled egg together with mayonnaise, salt and black pepper, usually called simply \"egg spread\", or an \"egg mayonnaise\" or \"egg mayo\". Cress is often seen as the typical accompaniment to an egg sandwich.\n\nIt is worth noting in passing that the term \"sandwich\" in British or Australian use always refers to a filling of any sort between two slices of bread: that is, bread slices from a loaf. An egg sandwich is thus egg between two bread slices. The same filling served in a cut roll, bagel, muffin or the like is not, ever, a \"sandwich\". It is an egg roll, egg bagel, egg muffin etc. \n\nIt is also common, in the United States, to use egg salad as a sandwich filling.\n\nPrompted by meat rationing during World War II, a manager for a White Castle at St. Louis introduced the first fast food egg dish with a fried egg sandwich. However, the dish was unpopular, and was abandoned as soon as wartime meat rationing was lifted. Fast food restaurants did not begin serving egg dishes again until the 1970s, starting with the McDonald's Egg McMuffin, invented in 1971 by a McDonald's franchisee in Santa Barbara, California.\n"}

{"id": "3996713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3996713", "title": "Tawassul", "text": "Tawassul\n\nTawassul is an Arabic word originated from wa-sa-la- wasilat (). The \"wasilah\" is a means by which a person, goal or objective is approached, attained or achieved. In another version of the meaning of tawassul in another text: Tawassul is an Arabic word that comes from a verbal noun, wasilah, which according to Ibn Manzur (d. 711/1311) in Lisān al-'Arab means \"a station of King, a rank, or act of devotion\".\nIn other words, it refers to a position of power due to one's proximity to the king or sovereign. While the \"tawassul\" or \"tawassulan\" is the use of wasilah for this purpose. In religious contexts, the \"tawassul\" is the use of a wasilah to arrive at or obtain favour of Allah.\n\nTawassul is an Arabic word that comes from a verbal noun, wasilah, which according to Ibn Manzur (d. 711/1311) in Lisān al-'Arab means \"a station with King, a rank, or act of devotion.\nThe word wasilat had been stated in the Quran two times ([5:35],[17:57]). It is translated as “a means that can be used to gain nearness to God”. Therefore, the typical meaning of tawassul or tawassulanis use of wasilat to obtain nearness to God. \n\nTawassul , as the main habitude of Supplications, has key role in to acceptation of them. \n\n\"O you who believe! be careful of (your duty to) Allah and seek means (wasilah) of nearness to Him and strive hard in His way that you may be successful\" (Q5:35)\n\nThe meaning of the term \"wasilah\" in the above verse according to Albani is a thing that is used to obtain closeness and favour of Allah. Some classical commentators, including the great Sufi exegetes, such as al-Qushayri (d. 465/1074) explain the use of \"al-wasilah\" in this verse to mean avoiding what is prohibited, fulfilling what is enjoined on us, and drawing near to God through good actions. Both Raghib al-Isfahani and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i opine that \"al-wasilah\" means to reach a certain goal through desire, inclination and willingness, and in fact wasilah towards God means observance of his path with knowledge and worship through adherence to the Sharia.It can be deduced from the verse above that intercession (tawassul) is only with the \"permission\" of Allah. Also, the practice of seeking intercession began during the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. An oft-cited Hadith in support of this is one narrated from Uthman ibn Hunaif regarding a blind man who Muslims believe was healed through the process.\n\nThe Hadith is as follows:\nVarious episodes from the life of Muhammad depict him interceding on behalf of his companions, mostly asking God to forgive their sins (Istighfar). For example, Aisha relates that he often slipped quietly from her side at night to go to the cemetery of Al-Baqi' to beseech forgiveness of God for the dead. Similarly, his istighfar is mentioned in the Salat al-Janazah and its efficacy explained.\n\nAnother early example of tawassul is represented by the idea of turning to God by means of Muhammad. This appears in an account concerning the story of a blind man who asked Muhammad to pray to God for his health because of his blindness. This hadith is quoted in some major collections of traditions, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal's musnad:\n\nThe Qur'an states: This verse raised the question as to whether or not Muhammad’s mediation was still possible after his death. A number of Islamic scholars including Al-Nawawi, Ibn Kathir and Ibn al-Athir in his exegesis relates the following episode, aiming to demonstrate its effectiveness:\n\n\"A Bedouin of the desert visited the Prophet’s tomb and greeted the Prophet, addressing him directly as if he were alive. “Peace upon you, Messenger of God!” Then he said, “I heard the word of God ‘If, when they had wronged themselves . . .,’ I came to you seeking pardon for my mistakes, longing for your intercession with our Lord!” The Bedouin then recited a poem in praise of the Prophet and departed. The person who witnessed the story says that he fell asleep, and in a dream he saw the Prophet saying to him, “O ‘Utbi, rejoin our brother the Bedouin and announce [to] him the good news that God has pardoned him!”\"\n\nThe Qur'an also states:The above verse lay emphasis on four things:\n\nAccording to the verse, the third regulation after faith in God and piety is \" seeking means (of approach to) His (presence and to His nearness and accessibility)\". Some of the religious scholars have interpreted \"wasilah\" (the means of approach) mentioned in the Quranic verse as faith and good deeds while others, who are majority have explained the word as the prophets, the righteous and favorites of Allah.\nAlso, the verse reveals that a person seeking means of approach to Allah will have in the first instance a believer and Muttaqeen (a person who fear Allah). Thus \"wasilah\" does not amount to associating partner with Allah but rather reaffirms the oneness of Allah, according to the opinion of Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri.\n\nThere is this agreement among Muslim theologians that a means (tawassul) is acceptable concepts to draw near to Allah but they can’t gain unanimity on what kind of means (Tawassul) is permissible. According to the main agreement people can draw near to Allah and invoke him by using of these permissible means such as their good act (their prayer, fasting and reciting the Quran) but there is the discussion on approach to Allah by means of the person of Muhammad and his dignity or other pious Muslims after the death.\n\nVarious episodes from the life of Muhammad depict him interceding on behalf of his companions, mostly asking God to forgive their sins (Istighfar). For example, Aisha relates that he often slipped quietly from her side at night to go to the cemetery of Al-Baqi' to beseech forgiveness of God for the dead...Similarly, his istighfar is mentioned in the Salat al-Janazah... and it's efficacy explained.\n\nAnother early example of tawassul is represented by the idea of turning to God by means of Muhammad. This appears in an account concerning the story of a blind man who asked Muhammad to pray to God for his health because of his blindness.This hadith is quoted in some major collections of traditions, such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal's musnad:\nAll jurists comprising Imami, Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanafi and Hanbali are unanimous on the permissibility of tawassul whether during the lifetime of Muhammad or after his demise. \nSyrian Islamic scholars Salih al-Nu`man, Abu Sulayman Suhayl al-Zabibi, and Mustafa ibn Ahmad al-Hasan al-Shatti al-Hanbali al-Athari al-Dimashqi have similarly released Fatwas in support of the practice.\n\nAl-Suyuti in his book \"History of the Caliphs\" also reports Caliph Umar’s prayer for rain after the death of Muhammad and specifies that on that occasion ‘Umar was wearing his mantle (al-burda), a detail confirming his \"tawassul\" through Muhammad at that occasion. Sahih al-Bukhari narrates similar situation as: \n\nSeeking Intercession (tawassul) is accepted and even advised in Shi'a Islam. Shia Scholars refer to Quranic verses such as 5:3, 12:97 and 12:98 and justify its permissibility. During the tawassul prayer Shia Muslims call on the names of Muhammad and the Ahl al-Bayt and use them as their intercessors/intermediaries to God. Shias always pray to and only to Allah, but as other Muslims, they accept tawassul as a means of seeking intercession.\n\nShia Muslims consider that Tawassul through prophets and Imams of Allah is the great justification of wasilah, because they had gain to the high degree of humanity and after death, they are alive and they are blessed by Allah.

Some recipes include Shaoxing wine. Some western Chinese restaurants also use soy sauce to flavor the rice, and add meat such as chicken.\n\nYangzhou fried rice is a perhaps the most well-known dish of the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. The recipe was invented by Qing China's Yi Bingshou (1754-1815) and the dish was named Yangzhou fried rice since Yi was once the regional magistrate of Yangzhou. It is often served with thousand fish soup. There are two ways of cooking the dish in terms of the preparation of the egg scrambled. The first variation is known as \"silver covered gold\", in which the egg is scrambled separately before mixing with the rice. The alternative \"gold covered silver\" method is described as pouring the liquid egg over the rice and vegetables mix and frying the two together. Various traditions call for a rice–egg ratio of 5:1 or 3:1.\n\nIn October 2015, as part of the 2500-year anniversary of the town of Yangzhou, an attempt was made in Yangzhou at beating the previous world record for fried rice set in 2014 by the Turkey culinary federation.

The organisers initially planned to send the end product to five companies for consumption by their staff. However, about of it ended up as pig swill as it had been cooked for four hours and was felt unsuitable for human consumption. As per organisers, the rest was sent to local canteens. However, due to a part of it being sent to feed animals, the world record attempt was disqualified, as a Guinness World Records spokesman said that it had become obvious that the dish was not fit for human consumption.\n\n\n \n"}

Established in 1890 by the original San Miguel Brewery (renamed San Miguel Corporation in 1964), it is the largest selling beer in the Philippines and Hong Kong. It is known in Chinese as 生力啤酒. San Miguel Beer was introduced in Spain by San Miguel Brewery in 1946. In 1953, its Spanish rights were spun-off by San Miguel Brewery and became an independent entity presently known as the Mahou-San Miguel Group.\n\n\n\nAs part of its overseas expansion, San Miguel moved into the Spanish market in 1953, setting up the company which would later become San Miguel Spain. Since 1946, there has been a company engaged in the production of malt for medicinal purposes known as La Segarra. In the early 1950s, its key shareholders Enrique Suárez Rezona, Ramón Vidal and Jaime Muñiz made contact with Andrés Soriano, then president of San Miguel Brewery, to allow them to produce beer under the San Miguel name in Spain. In 1953, San Miguel Brewery, Inc. signed the “Manila Agreement”, with the Philippine brewer setting up a new Spanish brewery, La Segarra, S.A. The company would later be renamed San Miguel Fabricas de Cerveza y Malta, S.A. in 1957, an affiliate of San Miguel Brewery, Inc. which initially held 20% equity share via its Hong Kong subsidiary.\n\nThe company was acquired by Mahou, S.A. from Groupe Danone in 2000, combining to form Spain’s largest brewer, the Mahou-San Miguel Group. On 26 February 2014, San Miguel and Mahou-San Miguel signed a co-operation agreement to promote jointly San Miguel Beer and expand its global footprint.\n\nThe history of San Miguel traces back to 1890, when a group of Spaniards decided to open the first brewery in Southeast Asia, specifically in Manila. The factory produced diverse types of beers and derivative products under the name “San Miguel”. In the colonial capital no one knew beer until then. For this reason the inauguration of the brewery was a historic event and became known as “The day of San Miguel”.\n\nIn February 1946 the corporation La Segarra S.A. was formed in Lleida, Catalonia, with the purpose of making beer, although the bureaucratic process caused production to be delayed until 1953. So, in 1954 the Group returned to Spain in a vessel stocked with Asian yeasts that made a 45-day journey across the ocean. In 1957 the Manila Agreement was signed with the president of the San Miguel Corporation, Andres Soriano, and San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory S.A. was established, independent from the Manila company. From that moment on, the two companies have followed different paths.\n\nIn 1965 San Miguel arrived to Africa, and by 1967 it spread to other capitals in Europe like London, Paris and Berlin. In 1970 it bought the Spanish- Dutch beer brand GULDER and its factory in Burgos. The three factories had a capacity of 600,000 hl, achieving a share of 7% of the national market. Thanks to the progressive opening in Spain and the work of the exports department, the 70s were a time of growth in exports of the beer both in Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, reaching an annual figure of 125,000 hl.\n\nThe formation of the Mahou-San Miguel Group traces its origin to Danone stocks. In 1994 the French multinational acquired 18% of San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory. In 1997 Danone grew its share to 82% and also owned a large part of Mahou. In the following years, Danone lost interest in the company and therefore the beer maker took advantage of the synergy with Mahou, merging the two and becoming Mahou-San Miguel. Later on it also absorbed the beer maker Alhambra of Granada.\n\nThe San Miguel \"escudo\" (seal) used as the brand logo of all San Miguel branded beer products is based on the original Spanish-era coat of arms of Manila. It is also the corporate logo of San Miguel Corporation and the San Miguel Brewery companies.\n\nThe Mahou-San Miguel Group does not use this logo for its San Miguel branded beers. Instead, it uses an image of a galleon as its brand logo.\n\nThe San Miguel Beermen are a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). The franchise is owned by the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) since 1975. It is one of three PBA ball clubs owned by the SMC group of companies along with the Magnolia Hotshots and Barangay Ginebra San Miguel. It is the only remaining original franchise in the PBA and leads the league with the most number of PBA titles - 23 to date. It is also the only team ever to have won at least one title in each of the five numerical decades of the PBA's existence so far.\n\n\n"}

It is \"usually a white flour or egg dough bread\". Aside from white flour, raisin bread is also made with other flours, such as all-purpose flour, oat flour, or whole wheat flour. Some recipes include honey, brown sugar, eggs, or butter. Variations of the recipe include the addition of walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans or, for a dessert, rum or whisky.\n\nRaisin bread is eaten in many different forms, including being served toasted for breakfast (\"raisin toast\") or made into sandwiches. Some restaurants serve raisin bread with their cheeseboards.\n\nIts invention has been popularly though incorrectly attributed to Henry David Thoreau in Concord, Massachusetts lore, but there have been published recipes for bread with raisins since 1671. Since the 15th century, breads made with raisins were made in Europe. In Germany stollen was a Christmas bread. Kulich was an Easter bread made in Russia and panettone was made in Italy. The earliest citation for \"raisin bread\" in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is dated to an 1845 article in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\". In England, raisin bread became a common element of high tea from the second half of the 19th century. In the 1920s, raisin bread was advertised as \"The Bread Of Iron\", due to the high iron content of the raisins. The bread became increasingly popular among English bakers in the 1960s.\n\nEuropean versions of raisin bread include the Estonian \"kringel\" and the Slovakian \"vianocka\". A similar food is raisin challah, a traditional Jewish food for Shabbat and holidays. It has been suggested that Garibaldi biscuits were based on a raisin bread that was eaten by the troops of Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\nThe United States Code of Federal Regulations specifies standards that raisin bread produced in the country must meet. This includes a requirement for the weight of the raisins to be equal to 50% of the weight of flour used. Raisin bread is one of five types of bread for which federal standards have been outlined.\n\nThe ways in which individual raisins move during rising and baking of the bread is often used as an analogy to explain the expansion of the universe.\n\n\n"}

The addition of a layer of raspberry jam is a common recipe variation. The colours used for the icing are usually some combination of brown, white, and pink. They are almost exclusively sized as individual servings, 60–80  mm in diameter. The tart was originally created in Australia and is mainly found there and in New Zealand.\n\nThe origin of the name \"neenish\" is unknown. A column in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" attributed the name to a woman named Ruby Neenish, however this was later revealed to be a prank. Alternative names such as \"nenische\" (recorded in 1929) and \"nienich\" (recorded in 1935) suggest a German origin, although \"neenish\" was known before the alternatives, suggesting these names were to give a \"continental\" flavour to the tart.\n\nWhile nenish cakes appear in Sydney newspaper advertisements as early as 1895, the earliest known published reference to neenish tarts is a recipe in the \"Sydney Mail\" (Sydney, New South Wales) in November 1901. The next known published recipe is very similar, published in the \"Daily Telegraph\" (Launceston, Tasmania) in January 1903. Both recipes used an almond-based pastry and a filling comprising a \"very thick custard of eggs and milk thickened with cornflour\". The top of the tart consisted of coffee and vanilla icing in equal halves. Another early printed recipe was in \"Miss Drake's Home Cookery\" published in 1929, calling for cream filling set with gelatine and pink christabelle and white icing on top. A 1932 recipe in \"Miranda's Cook Book\" calls for custard filling and chocolate and white icing.\n\nThe lemon-flavoured version of the tart most familiar to New Zealand residents is found in the \"Edmonds Cookery Book\". It includes a filling made from butter, icing sugar, sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice in a flour-based pastry base topped with half standard white icing and half chocolate (cocoa added) icing.\n\nIn Australia the term Pineapple tart often refers to a variation on the Neenish Tart, with pineapple jam below the filling, and passionfruit icing.\n"}

Originating from the town of Amatrice (in the mountainous Province of Rieti of Lazio region), the \"Amatriciana\" is one of the best known pasta sauces in present day Roman and Italian cuisine. The Italian government has named it a traditional agro-alimentary product of Lazio.\n\nAmatriciana originates from a recipe named \"gricia\". \"Grici\" were what Romans—modern dwellers of Rome, not the ancient ones—called the sellers of bread and comestibles. They were so called in that a number of them emigrated from the Swiss canton of Grisons. According to another hypothesis, the name originates from the hamlet of Grisciano, in the \"comune\" of Accumoli, near Amatrice. The sauce - nowadays named also \"Amatriciana bianca\" - was (and still is) prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek) and grated pecorino. At some point, a little olive oil was added to the recipe. In the 1960s, the Amatriciana sauce was still prepared in this way in Amatrice itself.\n\nThe invention of the first tomato sauces (and the likely earliest date for the introduction of tomato in the gricia, creating the Amatriciana) dates back to the late 18th century. The first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook \"L'Apicio Moderno\" by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi.\n\nThe Amatriciana recipe became increasingly famous in Rome over the 19th and early 20th centuries due to the pluricentennial connection between Rome and Amatrice. The recipe was extremely well received and rapidly went on to be considered a \"classic\" of the Roman Cuisine, even though it originated elsewhere. The name of the dish in the Romanesco dialect eventually became \"matriciana\" due to the apheresis typical of this dialect.\n\nWhile tomato-less \"gricia\" is still prepared in central Italy, it is the tomato-enriched \"amatriciana\" that is better known throughout Italy and exported everywhere. While in Amatrice the dish is prepared with spaghetti, the use of bucatini has become extremely common in Rome and is now prevalent. Other types of dry pasta (particularly rigatoni) are also used, whereas fresh pasta is generally avoided.\n\nThe recipe is known in several variants depending, among other things, on the local availability of certain ingredients. While everybody seems to agree about the use of guanciale and tomato, onion is not favored in Amatrice, but is shown in the classical handbooks of Roman cuisine. For frying, olive oil is most commonly used, but \"strutto\" (canned pork lard) is used as well.\n\nThe addition of garlic sauteed in olive oil, before adding the guanciale is also accepted , and for cheese either pecorino romano or Amatrice's pecorino (from the Monti Sibillini or Monti della Laga areas) can be used. The addition of black or chili pepper is common.\n\n\n\n"}

The French term for this style of loaf is \"pain de mie\", or, less commonly, \"pain anglais\". In the United States, many popular mass-produced sliced breads are actually pullman loaves; the slice of such breads is frequently square, with four straight crusts.\n\nThe name \"Pullman\" was derived from its use in the compact kitchens of the Pullman railway cars. Although the Pullman Company is credited with inventing the lidded baking pans used to create the square loaves, square tin pans existed long before the railroad company. European breadmakers began using the pans in the early 18th century to minimize crust. However, the loaves were selected by Pullman for use on his trains. Three Pullman loaves occupied the same space as two standard round-topped loaves, thus maximizing the use of space in the small Pullman kitchen.\n\n"}

In Cameroon it is a common favorite at ceremonies such as weddings, graduations and birthdays and is sometimes cooked with \"ndole\", a local vegetable.\nThere are several regional variations in name and ingredients. In Mali it is called \"zaamè\" in Bamanankan, and is a typical Sunday lunchtime favorite in urban, middle-class families. The name \"Jollof\" derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as \"ceebu jën\" or \"benachin\". In French-speaking areas, it is called \"riz au gras\". Despite the variations, the dish is \"mutually intelligible\" across the region, and has spread along with the diaspora to become the best known African dish outside the continent..\n\nBased on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire. Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in \"linguistic, historical or political patterns\". Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of \"blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy\" as well as the religion of Islam. Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Indochina. It may then have spread throughout the region through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue to thrive today, such as the Tijāniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.\n\nThe dish consists of rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, palm oil, onions, salt, spices (such as nutmeg, ginger, and cumin) and chili peppers (such as Scotch bonnet); optional ingredients can be added such as vegetables, meats, or fish. Due to the tomato paste and typically used red palm oil, the dish is mainly red in colour. The recipe differs from one region to another.\n\nThe main ingredients of jollof rice are rice and tomatoes; neither has any saturated fat or cholesterol. The addition of palm oil does add saturated fat. Jollof is primarily carbohydrates, as it is a rice dish. Since jollof is often served with chicken, beef, eggs and/or turkey, it is complemented by the protein from those accompanying dishes. Fish is sometimes used as an accompaniment, and can provide the dish with omega-3 fatty acids, as well as protein.\n\nOn the event of special occasions such as birthdays, weddings or baby showers, the dish can be presented and served made into shapes, overall a more formal presentation of the dish. As an option, fried plantain can also be placed on top, or beside the jollof rice, and then various meats are added around the rest of the dish.\n\nThere are multiple regions in Africa who debate over the geographical origins of jollof rice. However, one of the most vigorous jollof rivalries has been between Nigerians and Ghanaians. The main argument in this debate is currently centered on which country's version tastes better. The reason for the debate is due to the huge popularity of jollof, in regards to West African cuisine. Both Nigeria and Ghana have shown consistent competitiveness over the debate as to who can serve the dish the best. The debate has gone so far as to even having organized contest shows like the Jollof Festival in Washington, DC, in order for famous critics from all over the world to taste, examine the differences, and give their overall judgments on either forms of the dish. Recently, social media has also become a popular tool for people to share pictures, and opinions over who serves the dish the best.\n\nAlthough considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc.\n\nIn the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice and there are variations of the classic jollof rice; including coconut jollof rice, fisherman jollof rice (made with prawns, periwinkles, crayfish), mixed vegetables jollof rice, and rice and beans. More economical versions of jollof rice are popularly referred to among Nigerians as “concoction rice,” the preparation of which can involve as little as rice and pepper.\n\nGhanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or goat meat or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), jasmine or basmati rice and black pepper. The method of cooking jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well-cooked The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared. Ghanaian jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef, chicken, well-seasoned fried fish, or mixed vegetables.\n\nJollof in Ghana is also served alongside shito, a popular type of pepper which originates from Ghana, and salad during parties and other ceremonies.\n"}

Then they are ground or blended (using a blender) until a fine paste is achieved. Salt, bouillon cube, dried crayfish, vegetable oil (or any edible oil such as palm oil) and other seasonings are added to taste.

The most touted is Moin-Moin elemi meje, which translates to \"Moin-Moin with seven lives\".\n\nMoin-Moin usually comes in a slanted pyramid shape or a cylindrical shape, owing to the mold it is poured into prior to cooking. The pyramid shape comes from the traditional broad \"ewe eran\" (\"Thaumatococcus daniellii\") or banana leaves fashioned into a cone in one's palm, then the seasoned and garnished liquid is poured into the leaves, which is then folded.\n\nThe cylindrical shapes come from empty cans of milk or tomato sauce used in preparation of other dishes. Once placed in its mold, it is placed in a large pot about a tenth filled with water. The water is the source of steam that cooks the Moin-Moin. Moin-Moin is eaten alone or with bread as a snack, with rice as a meal or with ogi for breakfast or supper. it can also be taken with garri in the afternoon.\n\n\n"}

After serving in the Army during World War II, seeing action in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, he moved to Memphis.\n\nPhillips started his radio career in 1949 on WHBQ/560 in Memphis with a special studio at the Gayoso Hotel. In 1953 WHBQ moved to the mezzanine floor of the Chisca Hotel. Dewey Phillips was the city's leading radio personality for nine years and was the first to simulcast his \"Red, Hot & Blue\" show on radio and television. During the 1950s he had 100,000 listeners to his 9pm-midnight slot and he received 3,000 letters a week.\n\nPhillips' on-air persona was a speed-crazed hillbilly, with a frantic delivery and entertaining sense of humor. However, he also had a keen ear for music the listening public would enjoy, and he aired both black and white music, which was abundant in post-World War II Memphis, a booming river city which attracted large numbers of rural blacks and whites (along with their musical traditions). Dr.W. Herbert Brewster, pastor of East Trigg Baptist Church was a frequent guest on Dewey's program. He played a great deal of rhythm and blues, country music, boogie-woogie, and jazz as well as Sun Records artists. In 1950, Phillips and his friend Sam Phillips (no relation) decided to launch their own record label. Joe Hill Louis waxed an electric blues single, \"Boogie in the Park\" (recorded in July 1950 and released the following month). It was the only record released on the Phillips label before Sam founded Sun Records.\n\nOn 10 July 1954, he was the first DJ to broadcast the young Elvis Presley's debut record, \"That's All Right\" / \"Blue Moon Of Kentucky\" (Sun 209), and got Presley to reveal his race in an interview by asking which high school the 19-year-old singer attended (knowing that, because of segregation, his audience would readily know what race attended which schools).\n\nPhillips briefly hosted an afternoon program on WHBQ-TV/13 in the mid-1950s. It mostly consisted of Phillips playing records while he and others clowned around in front of the camera.\n\nThough Phillips was not involved in the payola scandals of the time (as was Freed), he was fired in late 1958 when the station adopted a Top 40 format, phasing out his freeform style. He spent the last decade of his life working at smaller radio stations, seldom lasting long. \nThe popular musical \"Memphis\" is said to be based loosely on Dewey Phillips' life and career, although elements crucial in the career of Phillips' contemporary Alan Freed appear to be intermixed as well.\n\nA heavy drinker and longtime drug user, mainly painkillers and amphetamines (which contributed to his manic on-air behavior), Phillips died of heart failure at age 42. He is buried in Hardin County, Tennessee, at Crump Cemetery.\n\n"}

She was responsible for coining the term \"chutney soca\" in 1987 with her first album, entitled \"Chutney Soca\", which included both English and Hindustani versions of the songs. She had her biggest hit the following year when her \"(Roll Up the Tassa) Mr. Bissessar\" was a Road March contender. She was instrumental in tassa and chutney soca finding its place in Carnival and her efforts later led to competitions such as Chutney Soca Monarch.\n\nDrupatee Ramgoonai was born on Sunrees Road in Charlo Village, Penal, Saint Patrick County, Penal-Debe, Trinidad and Tobago, on 2 March 1958. She started singing alongside her mother in the mandir at a young age, then went on to learn Indian classical singing from her trainer Ustad James Ramsewak, a veteran in the field. She also gained exposure on Mastana Bahar, the Indian Cultural Pageant, winning the local song category in 1983 and 1984. Her repertoire back then included Indian classical, Indian folk, bhajans, and film songs. She also had some formal vocal training in Indian classical music from classes under the acclaimed Professor H. S. Adesh.\n\nRamgoonai recorded her first crossover tune in 1987, entitled \"Chutney Soca\", and gained moderate success in the calypso tents. The term chutney soca was first coined by Drupatee Ramgoonai with that crossover tune \"Chutney Soca\" in 1987 and Ramgoonai is considered the mother of chutney soca. The following year she had her mega hit \"Mr Bissessar (Roll Up de Tassa)\", which brought her international acclaim and served as the nursery for this genre of music called chutney soca, resulting in a commercial market being created for this type of music as well. She was consistent for many years with hits such as \"Pepper\", \"Hotter Than a Chulha\", \"Careless Driver\", \"Motilal\", \"Tassawalley\", and \"Manzalina\" and even the monster hit \"Wuk Up D Ladki\" with Machel Montano. Her more recent contributions include \"Mohana bina Gowna\", \"Doh Beat Yuh Wife\", \"Parosin Maco-ing\", \"D Wedding Song\", \"Chutney Soca Wine\", and \"Violin\".\n\nShe has won Nafieta awards and various trophies plus other awards for her unmatched contribution to Chutney Soca music. She almost won the Road March title in Trinidad and Tobago in 1988, coming second. She is regarded as the Chutney Soca Queen for the blending of these musical styles in some of her songs like \"Chutney Soca\", \"Hotter than a Chulha\" and Special Brew. In recent years she has even started doing chutney parang at Christmas time with songs such as \"Chutney Parang\" and \"Fruit Cake\".\n\nShe created history as being the first woman of Indian descent to sing calypso and soca and has been one of the main targets of those who are scandalised by women and Indians singing chutney, chutney soca, calypso, and soca.\n\nShe is well known throughout the world for her hot and spicy Chutney soca performances. She has performed throughout the Caribbean, North America, Europe and even India alongside many internationally renowned stars. Up to this day she continues to release tasteful music and do various performances across the globe and is still a force to be reckoned with. In Kumar Mahabir's publication \"Portraits of Chutney Singers in Trinidad and Tobago\" (2012) she was hailed as the \"undisputed Chutney Queen\". In 2016 Drupatee signed an exclusive digital distribution agreement with Fox Fuse, making her entire music catalog available digitally worldwide for the first time.\n\n"}
{"id": "4042253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4042253", "title": "Oral medicine", "text": "Oral medicine\n\nOral medicine (sometimes termed dental medicine, oral and maxillofacial medicine or stomatology) is a specialty focused on the mouth and nearby structures. It lies at the interface between medicine and dentistry.\n\nThe specialty is defined within Europe under Directive 2001/19/EC.\n\nThe importance of the mouth in medicine has been recognized since the earliest known medical writings. For example, Hippocrates, Galen and others considered the tongue to be a \"barometer\" of health, and emphasized the diagnostic and prognostic importance of the tongue. However, oral medicine as a specialization is a relatively new subject area. It used to be termed \"stomatology\" (-\"stomato-\" + \"-ology\"). In some institutions, it is termed \"oral medicine and oral diagnosis\". American physician and dentist, Thomas E Bond authored the first book on oral and maxillofacial pathology in 1848, entitled \"A Practical Treatise on Dental Medicine\". The term \"oral medicine\" was not used again until 1868. Jonathan Hutchinson is also considered the father of oral medicine by some. Oral medicine grew from a group of New York dentists (primarily periodontists), who were interested in the interactions between medicine and dentistry in the 1940s. Before becoming its own specialty in the United States, oral medicine was historically once a subset of the specialty of periodontics, with many periodontists achieving board certification in oral medicine as well as periodontics. \n\nOral medicine is concerned with clinical diagnosis and non-surgical management of non-dental pathologies affecting the orofacial region (the mouth and the lower face).\n\nMany systemic diseases have signs or symptoms that manifest in the orofacial region. Pathologically, the mouth may be afflicted by many cutaneous and gastrointestinal conditions. There is also the unique situation of hard tissues penetrating the epithelial continuity (hair and nails are intra-epithelial tissues). The biofilm that covers teeth therefore causes unique pathologic entities known as plaque-induced diseases.\n\nExample conditions that oral medicine is concerned with are lichen planus, Behçet's disease and pemphigus vulgaris. Moreover, it involves the diagnosis and follow-up of pre-malignant lesions of the oral cavity, such as leukoplakias or erythroplakias and of chronic and acute pain conditions such as paroxysmal neuralgias, continuous neuralgias, myofascial pain, atypical facial pain, autonomic cephalalgias, headaches and migraines. Another aspect of the field is managing the dental and oral condition of medically compromised patients such as cancer patients suffering from related oral mucositis, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws or oral pathology related to radiation therapy. Additionally, it is involved in the diagnosis and management of dry mouth conditions (such as Sjögren's syndrome) and non-dental chronic orofacial pain, such as burning mouth syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia and temporomandibular joint disorder.\n\nIt is not uncommon for an individual to experience a lump/swelling in the oral environment. The overall presentation is highly variable and the progression of these lesions can also differ, for example: development of a lesion into a bulla or a malignant neoplasm. Lumps and swellings can occur due to a variety of conditions, both benign and malignant such as:\n\n\nSo as seen above the list is extensive and by no means is this a complete and comprehensive representation of all the possible lumps/swellings that can occur in the mouth as to the means of acquiring a swelling in the mouth. When considering what a lump might be caused by the site of which it has appeared can be of significance. Below are some examples of swellings/lumps which usually are present as specific locations in the oral cavity:\n\n\nIf there is any suspect or unknown reason as to why a lump has arisen In an individuals mouth it is important to establish when this first was noticed and the accompanied symptoms if any. On examination ensure that there is not an obvious cause to the swelling/lump via a thorough: medical, social, dental and family history, followed by an oral examination. Whilst examining the suspected lesion there are some diagnostic aids to note which can be used to formulate a provisional diagnosis. There are many factors taken into consideration in this diagnosis, such as:\n\n\nOnce the surrounding tissues and the immediate management of any lumps/swellings are taken care of, an Image of the full extent of the lesion is needed. This is done to establish what the lump/swelling is associated with and to ensure that any damaging probablitiy is kept to a minimum. There are a variety of imaging technique options which are chosen based on the lesion: size, location, growth pattern etc. Some examples of images used are: DPT, Scintigraphy, Sialography, Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ultrasound.\n\nAs described some lumps or swellings can be in close relation to anatomical structures. Commonly, Teeth are associated in a lesion which brings about the question – “are they still vital?” In order to clarify, any tooth that is associated with a lump or swelling is vitality tested, examined for any pathology or restorative deficiencies in order to determine the long term prognosis of this tooth and how this might affect treatment of the lump/swelling at hand.\n\nAlongside any radiographs wchih may be justified, Blood tests may be needed in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis if there is a suspicion of potential blood dyscrasias or any endocrinopathy involvement.\n\nFinally, a particularly vital means of diagnosis is a biopsy. These tend to be regularly done in the cases of singular, chronic lesions and are carried out in an urgent manner as lesions of this category have a significant malignant potential. The indications to carry out a biopsy include:\n\n\nOnce a small piece of tissue is removed for the biopsy, it is then microscopically histopathologically examined.\n\nAustralian programs are accredited by the Australian Dental Council (ADC). They are three years in length and culminate with either a master's degree (MDS) or a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry degree (DClinDent). Fellowship can then be obtained with the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, FRACDS (Oral Med) and or the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, FRCP.\n\nCanadian programs are accredited by the Canadian Commission on Dental Accreditation (CDAC). They are a minimum of three years in length and usually culminate with a master's (MSc) degree. Currently, only the University of Toronto, the University of Alberta, and the University of British Columbia offer programs leading to the specialty. Most residents combine oral medicine programs with oral and maxillofacial pathology programs leading to a dual specialty. Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Fellowship exams with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada (FRCD(C)).\n\nIndian programs are accredited by the Dental Council of India (DCI).Oral Medicine is in conjunction with oral radiology in India and it is taught in both graduate and post graduate levels as Oral Medicine and Radiology.They are three years in length and culminate with a master's degree (MDS) in Oral Medicine and Radiology.\n\nNew Zealand has traditionally followed the UK system of dual training (dentistry and medicine) as a requisite for specialty practice; the University of Otago Faculty of Dentistry currently offers a 5-year intercalated clinical doctorate/medical degree (DClinDent/MBChB) program. On 9 July 2013, the dental council of New Zealand proposed that the prescribed qualifications for oral medicine be changed to include the new DClinDent in addition to a medical degree, with no requirement for a standard dental degree.\n\nIn the UK, oral medicine is one of the 13 specialties of dentistry recognized by the General Dental Council (GDC). The GDC defines oral medicine as: \"[concerned with] oral health care of patients with chronic recurrent and medically related disorders of the mouth and with their diagnosis and non-surgical management.\" Unlike many other countries, oral medicine physicians in the UK do not usually partake in the dental management of their patients. Some UK oral medicine specialists have dual qualification with both medical and dental degrees. However, in 2010 the GDC approved a new curriculum for oral medicine, and a medical degree is no longer a prerequisite for entry into specialist training. Specialist training is normally 5 years, although this may be reduced to a minimum of 3 years in recognition of previous training, such as a medical degree. In the UK, oral medicine is one of the smallest dental specialties. According to the GDC, as of December 2014 there were 69 clinicians registered as specialists in oral medicine. As of 2012, there were 16 oral medicine units across the UK, mostly based in dental teaching hospitals, and around 40 practising consultants. The British Society for Oral Medicine has suggested that there are not enough oral medicine specialists, and that there should be one consultant per million population. Competition for the few training posts is keen, although new posts are being created and the number of trainees increased.\n\nThe American Dental Association (CODA) accredited programs are a minimum of two years in length. Oral medicine, however, is not an American Dental Association recognized specialty, but many oral medicine specialists fulfill a very important role by teaching at dental schools and graduate programs to ensure dentists and other dental specialists receive excellent training in medical topics pertinent to dental practice. The ADA has recently started a dental practice parameters for world class quality services.\n\n\n"}

It comes in the form of palm-sized (approx. 9.5 cm × 5.0 cm or 4\" × 2\") rounded rectangle-shaped biscuits. Variants include organic and Weetabix Minis (bite-sized) versions. The UK cereal is manufactured in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, and exported to over 80 countries. Weetabix for Canada and the United States is manufactured in Cobourg, Ontario, in both organic and conventional versions.\n\nWeetabix is made from whole grain wheat and the version sold in the United Kingdom has 3.8 g of fibre in a 37.5 g serving (2 biscuits) (10.1% by weight). The product sold in Canada and the U.S. has 4 grams of fibre in a 35 g serving (11.4% by weight).\n\nProduced in the UK since 1932, Weetabix is the British version of the original Australian Weet-Bix. Both Weet-Bix and Weetabix were invented by Bennison Osborne, an Australian. Weet-Bix was introduced in Australia through the company “Grain Products Limited” in the mid-1920s, with funding from businessman Arthur Shannon and marketing assistance from Osborne’s New Zealand friend Malcolm Macfarlane. To both Osborne’s and Macfarlane’s disappointment, Grain Products sold both its Australian company (in 1928) and then its New Zealand company (in 1930), to the Sanitarium Health Foods Company. Osborne and Macfarlane then went to South Africa where Arthur Shannon, the owner of Grain Products, funded another Weet-Bix factory. While in South Africa, Osborne modified his Weet-Bix recipe and with Macfarlane, obtained private funding and began the development of a new company, The British and African Cereal Company Limited, naming the new company's product, Weetabix. The company commenced business in England in 1932 in an unused gristmill at Burton Latimer, near Kettering. In 1936, the name of the company was changed to Weetabix Limited.\n\nWeet-Bix is currently marketed in Australasia by Sanitarium and South Africa by Bokomo. The product was introduced to Canada in 1967, when Weetabix Limited began exporting the product to Canada. The United States followed in 1968.\n\nOn May 3, 2012 Bright Food announced it was taking a 60% stake in Weetabix in a deal that values the company at £1.2bn. Baring Private Equity Asia acquired the remaining 40% from Lion Capital in 2015. On 18 April 2017, it was announced that Post Holding would buy the company from Bright Food.\n\nIn British advertising in the 1980s, Weetabix anthropomorphized the biscuits, representing a group of 'street-wise' young teens, beginning as 'skinheads'. Their appearances on the packaging and associated publicity featured catch phrases such as \"titchy breakfast cereals\" to describe rivals, with the response \"Neet Weet Mate\", \"OK!\". The lead Weetabix was voiced by Bob Hoskins.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the brand was advertised with the slogan \"Have you had your Weetabix?', based on the idea that someone who had eaten Weetabix would be filled with unbeatable strength and energy, causing those who oppose them to flee out of self-preservation. This was used to humorous effect in a variety of adverts re-imagining the outcome of fairy tales and historic events. In 2017, the campaign was reintroduced, with a reference to the English fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk.

Previously, they were known as Fruitibix, Bananabix and Chocobix (depending upon the additions), then as Minibix.\n\nOrganic versions of Weetabix are sold in various countries.\n\nWeetabix launched a chocolate-powder infused version of the original Weetabix in the UK in July 2010 in a 24 pack size.\n\nA smaller-sized Weetabix biscuit with cocoa and chocolate chips.\n\nA sweeter form of the Weetabix biscuit which is baked with golden syrup.\n\nA banana-flavoured version of Weetabix.\n\nA version with added wheat gluten protein granules was introduced in the UK in April 2016, available in three forms, the standard biscuit shapes, as well as regular and chocolate flavour \"Crunch\" pipe shapes.\n\nOatibix is a breakfast cereal that was introduced in the United Kingdom in August 2006. It was invented by Weetabix Limited. It is similar to Weetabix, but is based on whole grain oats instead of wheat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4050188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4050188", "title": "Red yeast rice", "text": "Red yeast rice\n\nRed yeast rice (), red rice \"koji\" (べにこうじ, lit. 'red \"koji\"'), red fermented rice, red kojic rice, red \"koji\" rice, anka, or angkak, is a bright reddish purple fermented rice, which acquires its colour from being cultivated with the mold \"Monascus purpureus\".\n\nRed yeast rice is what is referred to as a \"koji\" in Japanese, meaning \"grain or bean overgrown with a mold culture\", a food preparation tradition going back to ca. 300 BC. In both the scientific and popular literature in English that draws principally on Japanese, red yeast rice is most often referred to as \"red rice \"koji\"\". English language articles favoring Chinese literature sources prefer the translation \"red yeast rice.\"\n\nRed yeast rice is produced by cultivating the yeast species \"Monascus purpureus\" on rice. The rice is first soaked in water until the grains are fully saturated. The raw soaked rice can then either be directly inoculated or it can be steamed for the purpose of sterilizing and cooking the grains prior to inoculation. Inoculation is done by mixing either \"M. purpureus\" spores or powdered red yeast rice together with the rice that is being treated. The mix is then incubated in an environment around room temperature for 3–6 days. During this period of time, the rice should be fully cultured with \"M. purpureus\", with each rice grain turning bright red in its core and reddish purple on the outside. The fully cultured rice is then either sold as the dried grain, or cooked and pasteurized to be sold as a wet paste, or dried and pulverized to be sold as a fine powder. China is the world's largest producer of red yeast rice, but European companies have entered the market.\n\nRed yeast rice is used to color a wide variety of food products, including pickled tofu, red rice vinegar, \"char siu\", Peking Duck, and Chinese pastries that require red food coloring. It is also traditionally used in the production of several types of Chinese \"huangjiu\" (\"Shaoxing jiu\"), and Japanese \"sake\" (\"akaisake\"), imparting a reddish color to these wines. Although used mainly for its color in cuisine, red yeast rice imparts a subtle but pleasant taste to food and is commonly used in the cuisine of the Fujian province of China. Red yeast rice (\"angkak\" in Filipino) is also used widely in the Philippines to traditionally color and preserve certain dishes like fermented shrimp (\"bagoong alamang\"), \"burong isda\" (fermented rice and fish), and \"balao-balao\" (fermented rice and shrimp).\n\nIn addition to its culinary use, red yeast rice is also used in Chinese herbology and traditional Chinese medicine. Its use has been documented as far back as the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD. It is taken internally to invigorate the body, aid in digestion, and revitalize the blood. A more complete description is in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, \"Ben Cao Gang Mu-Dan Shi Bu Yi\", from the Ming Dynasty (1378–1644).\n\nIn the late 1970s, researchers in the United States and Japan were isolating lovastatin from \"Aspergillus\" and monacolins from \"Monascus\", respectively, the latter being the same fungus used to make red yeast rice but cultured under carefully controlled conditions. Chemical analysis soon showed that lovastatin and monacolin K are identical. The article \"The origin of statins\" summarizes how the two isolations, documentations and patent applications were just months apart. Lovastatin became the patented, prescription drug Mevacor. Red yeast rice went on to become a contentious, non-prescription dietary supplement in the United States and other countries.\n\nLovastatin and other prescription 'statin' drugs inhibit cholesterol synthesis by blocking action of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. As a consequence, circulating total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are lowered by 24-49% depending on the statin and dose. Different strains of \"Monascus\" fungus will produce different amounts of monacolins. The 'Went' strain of \"Monascus purpureus\" (purpureus = dark red in Latin), when properly fermented and processed, will yield a dried red yeast rice powder that is approximately 0.4% monacolins, of which roughly half will be monacolin K (identical to lovastatin). Monacolin content of a red yeast rice product is described in a 2008 clinical trial report.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) position is that red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K, i.e., lovastatin, are identical to a drug and, thus, subject to regulation as a drug. In 1998, the FDA initiated action to ban a product (Cholestin) containing red yeast rice extract. The U.S. District Court in Utah allowed the product to be sold without restriction. This decision was reversed on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. (Moore, 2001) (see External links: PDRhealth). Thereafter, the FDA sent Warning Letters to companies selling red yeast rice. The product disappeared from the market for a few years.\n\nIn 2003, red yeast rice products began to reappear in the U.S. market. In 2007, the FDA sent Warning Letters to two dietary supplement companies. One was making a monacolin content claim about its RYR product and the other was not, but the FDA noted that both products contained monacolins. Both products were withdrawn. In this press release the FDA stated that consumers should \"… not buy or eat red yeast rice products … may contain an unauthorized drug that could be harmful to health.\" The rationale for \"… harmful to health …\" was that consumers might not understand that the dangers of monacolin-containing red yeast rice might be the same as those of prescription statin drugs.\n\nA products analysis report from 2010 tested 12 products commercially available in the US and reported that per 600 mg capsule, total monacolins content ranged from 0.31 to 11.15 mg. A 2017 study tested 28 brands of red yeast rice supplements purchased from US retailers, stating \"the quantity of monacolin K varied from none to prescription strength [...]\" Many of these avoid FDA regulation by not having any appreciable monacolin content. Their labels and websites say no more than \"fermented according to traditional Asian methods\" or \"similar to that used in culinary applications.\" The labeling on these products often says nothing about cholesterol. If they do not contain lovastatin, do not claim to contain lovastatin, and do not make a claim to lower cholesterol, they are not subject to FDA action. Two reviews confirm that the monacolin content of red yeast rice dietary supplements can vary over a wide range, with some containing negligible monacolins.\n\nThe amount typically used in clinical trials is 1200–2400 mg/day of red yeast rice containing approximately 10 mg total monacolins, of which half are monacolin K. This does raise a question about the function of the other monacolins and non-monacolin compounds in the products, as the monacolin K content is lower than what is usually considered effective for lovastatin (20–80 mg/day). A meta-analysis reported LDL-cholesterol lowered by 1.02 mmol/L (39.4 mg/dL) compared to placebo. The incidence of reported adverse effects ranged from 0% to 5% and was not different from controls. A second meta-analysis incorporating more recent clinical trials reported significant lowering of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.\n\nWithin the first review, the largest and longest duration trial was conducted in China: the China Coronary Secondary Prevention Study (CCSPS). Close to 5,000 post-heart attack patients were enrolled for an average of 4.5 years to receive either a placebo or a RYR product named Xuezhikang (血脂康). The test product was an ethanol extract of red yeast rice, with a monacolin K content of 11.6 mg/day. Key CCSPS results: In the treated group, risk of subsequent heart attacks was reduced by 45%, cardio deaths by 31%, and all-cause deaths by 33%.\n\nThe CCSPS heart attack and cardiovascular death outcomes appear to be better than what has been reported for prescription statin drugs. A 2008 review pointed out that the cardioprotective effects of statins in Japanese populations occur at lower doses than are needed in Western populations, and theorized that the low amount of monacolins found in Xuezhikang might have been more effectively athero-protective than expected in the Chinese population in the CCSPS study for the same reason.\n\nThe safety of red yeast rice products has not been established, and some commercial supplements have been found to contain high levels of the toxin citrinin. As commercial products will have highly variable amounts of monacolins, and rarely declare this content on the label, defining risk is difficult. Ingredient suppliers have also been suspected of \"spiking\" red yeast rice preparations with purified lovastatin. As evidence, one published analysis reported several commercial products as being almost entirely monacolin K - which would occur if the drug lovastatin was added - rather than the expected composition of many monacolin compounds. Statin drugs are known to cause muscle and liver damage. Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and possibly kidney failure (renal failure). This is why they are prescription drugs rather than over-the-counter, and with recommendations that the patients' physicians schedule liver function tests on a regular basis. There are reports in the literature of muscle myopathy and liver damage resulting from red yeast rice usage. From a placebo-controlled trial in patients with known statin-associated myalgias, in the treated group, two patients dropped out because of myalgia, 1 for diarrhea, and 1 for dizziness. In the placebo group, one dropped out for myalgia. Creatine phosphokinase increased slightly in the treated group (from 122 to 128 IU/L) versus decreasing with placebo (117 to 101 IU/L), but the shifts were not statistically significant. Subjective muscle pain scores were similar for the two groups. \"The potential safety signals of myopathies and liver injury raise the hypothesis that the safety profile of RYR is similar to that of statins. Continuous monitoring of dietary supplements should be promoted to finally characterize their risk profile, thus supporting regulatory bodies for appropriate actions.\" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food concluded that when red yeast rice preparations contained monacolins, the Panel was unable to identify an intake that it could consider as safe. The reason given was case study reports of severe adverse reactions to products containing monacolins at amounts as low as 3 mg/day.\n\nRed yeast rice is not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding.\n\n\n"}

Only types 2, 5 and 6 have their own independent meaning and rules of usage; the other types are either \"lightened\" or \"weighted\" versions of these three \"basic\" versions.\n\nStrict rules exist as to which type of a bow should be used at any particular time. The rules are very complicated, and are not always carried out in most parishes. Old Believers are generally much more punctillious about bows in comparison with the official Orthodoxy.\n\n\nIt is also important to note that traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox service has no kneeling in the Western sense of standing on one's knees. While kneeling for prayer was customary in the primitive church, the Byzantine tradition did not maintain it, and the people stood traditionally. In the 20th century in some western countries, some Eastern Orthodox churches have begun to use pews and kneelers and so have begun kneeling in some parts of the service.\n\nOrthodox tradition specifies that the faithful are to stand rather than kneel in prayer from Pascha (Easter) until Pentecost, and on all Sundays throughout the year, in honour of the Resurrection. That dates from the time when kneeling was more prevalent than it is today. There is some variation in interpretation, with some traditions, notably in the Greek church, extending this prohibition on kneeling to also preclude prostrations. Within the Slavic churches, there is regional variation in practice, with some places avoiding prostrations on Sundays and others making the usual prostrations regardless of the day of the week.\n\nThe Russian Old Rite, which reflects the praxis of the Russian church prior to the 17th-century reforms, which brought it in line with Greek practice as it stood at the time, itself the result of revision over the centuries, explicitly requires prostrations to be made at certain points during the services regardless of whether it is a Sunday, including at the end of \"Shine, Shine\" throughout the paschal season. That would seem to suggest that the canons forbidding kneeling on Sundays were not anciently understood to also prohibit prostrations. Indeed, the rubrics of the services require the faithful to prostrate before the Cross on the Third Sunday of Great Lent and also on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, even if it falls on a Sunday.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4053139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4053139", "title": "Duppy", "text": "Duppy\n\nDuppy is a word of African origin commonly used in Jamaica meaning ghost or spirit. The word is sometimes spelled duffy.\n\nIt is both singular and plural. Much of Caribbean folklore revolves around duppy. Duppy are generally regarded as malevolent spirits. They are said to mostly come out and haunt people at night, and people from around the islands claim to have seen them. The \"Rolling Calf\" (a scary creature said to have chains around its body), \"Three footed horse\", and \"Old Higue\" are examples of the more malicious spirits.\n\nIn many of the islands of the Lesser Antilles, duppy are known as \"jumbies\". Barbados also uses the word duppy and it holds the same meaning as it does in Jamaica.\n\nOriginating in Central Africa, the duppy is part of Bantu folklore. A duppy can be either the manifestation (in human or animal form) of the soul of a dead person, or a malevolent supernatural being. But the word duppy more likely originates from the Ga language as most of the African folklore and culture in Jamaica comes from the Ashanti people(a similar Kwa speaking people also from Ghana). In the Ga language of Ghana, \"Adope\" literally means dwarf but in Ghanaian folklore spirits are dwarves. In Obeah, a person is believed to possess two souls — a good soul and an earthly soul. In death, the good soul goes to heaven to be judged by God, while the earthly spirit remains for three days in the coffin with the body, where it may escape if proper precautions are not taken, and appear as a duppy.\n\nThe term \"duppy\" has been featured in various musical works from the Caribbean. According to Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, after Bob Marley wrote the song \"My Cup\", Marley was complaining to Lee that he was too \"successful\" and was being plagued by hangers-on and leeches, referring to them as duppy in the context of \"human vampires\" (or scroungers). Lee apparently consoled him by saying, \"Look, we'll sort this out — we are duppy conquerors.\" Marley then wrote \"Duppy Conqueror\". The term \"duppy\" is also referenced in the song \"Mr. Brown\".\n\nSeveral other Jamaican artists have recorded songs that refer to duppy, including Bunny Wailer's \"Duppy Gun\", and Ernie Smith's \"Duppy Gun-Man\". Yellowman released an album titled \"Duppy or Gunman\". There was also a drum & bass single written by the duo Chase & Status called \"Duppy Man\" featuring Capleton's vocals from his track \"Slew Dem\". In 2008, Jamaican dancehall artist Demarco had a hit with the single \"Duppy Know Who Fi Frighten\" on the well-known \"Shoot Out\" riddim. Most recently, dancehall phenomenon Vybz Kartel released \"Touch a Button Nuh\" which mentions a duppy in the interlude. Collie Buddz sings about \"duppy\" in his song \"Sensimillia\". Roots Manuva refers to a duppy possessing him in \"Witness (One Hope)\", and released an album entitled \"Duppy Writer\" in 2010. Drake, a prominent hip-hop figure, made the song “Duppy Freestyle” in 2018.\n\nA High Wind in Jamaica (1929) by Richard Hughes makes several references to duppy.\n\nIn Avram Davidson's 1961 short story \"Where Do You Live, Queen Esther\", an old Caribbean domestic worker in New York (the \"Queen Esther\" of the title) keeps a tiny dried frog tied with a scarlet ribbon in a cigarette tin. The frog turns out to be a duppy, which comes to terrifying life when an unpleasant employer takes the liberty of looking uninvited through the servant's possessions.\n\nThe James Bond novel \"Live and Let Die\" by Ian Fleming mentions duppy and the rolling calf in the chapter \"The Undertaker's Wind\".\n\nThe protagonist of the novel \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" by Nalo Hopkinson is an Obeah-woman in training, learning from her grandmother. She uses her abilities to defeat an evil Obeah-man and his duppy.\n\nIn another Nalo Hopkinson book, \"Midnight Robber,\" \"Duppy Dead Town is where people go when life boof them, when hope left them and happiness cut she eye 'pon them and strut away.\"\n\nThe term \"duppy\" is used in Neil Gaiman's 2005 novel, \"Anansi Boys\", in which it appears to refer to any ghost.\n\nIn Sherwood Smith's novel \"Revenant Eve\", the main character is sent back in time as a duppy, here regarded as a sort of guardian spirit, to a distant ancestor.\n\nIn Peter Matthiessen's novel \"Far Tortuga\", the character, Wodie, tells his fellow turtle hunters that he has never seen a duppy, which is odd because, he tells them, \"...I born with a caul...\" - a membrane covering a newborn's head and face, a condition occurring in fewer than one in 80,00 births.\n\nThe term \"duppy\" was featured on the television show \"Amazing Stories\" in episode 13, entitled \"The Sitter\". In this episode, a duppy is discussed between a Caribbean woman and the two boys she has been hired to babysit. She tells the boys about the duppy in order to prevent them from acting mischievously.\n\nIn the television film \"The Stone Tape\", the interior of a room in an old mansion inexplicably records the final moments of people who died there, replaying their last sounds and images and leading many people to believe it haunted. During World War II, the house is used by American soldiers. Years later, a woman who lived near the house recalls being told by an African American soldier that the house had \"duppy\". Not having heard the term before or knowing what it meant, she thinks he might have said \"guppies\".\n\nIn the Syfy television series, \"Lost Girl\", the episode \"Adventures in Fae-bysitting\" features a babysitter named Lisa who is a duppy. She is a ghost that can only be invoked every 100 years, using a special necklace. When invoked, she is essentially an empty vessel alive only through her invoker's life energy to carry out murders for them.\n\nIn Episode 4 of Season 4 of the HBO series \"Boardwalk Empire\", Doctor Valentin Narcisse talks to Dunn Purnsley about how \"duppy\" is used in the Caribbean to refer to a person of African descent \"who sucks his blood from his people.\"\n\nCommon enemies in the Acclaim video game \"Shadow Man\" (available for Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast, and PC) are called duppy. They appear as cadaverous humanoid creatures that attack at close range with their claws and from a distance by vomiting projectiles of green goo.\n\n"}

In December of that year, some alicantese vine growers popularized this custom to better sell huge amounts of grapes from an excellent harvest.\n\nThe tradition consists of eating a grape with each bell strike at midnight of December 31. According to the tradition, that leads to a year of prosperity. In some areas, it is believed that the tradition wards away witches and general evil, although this \"magic\" is treated like an old heritage, and in modern days it's viewed as a cultural tradition to welcome the new year.\n\nThere are two main places where people gather to eat the grapes: with family after the dinner or in the main squares around the country, the Puerta del Sol in Madrid being the most famous place to do it.\n\nThe twelve grapes are linked to the Puerta del Sol tower clock, where this tradition started and from where the change of year is always broadcast on major networks including Televisión Española since 1962.\n\nThis tradition was also adopted in places with a broad cultural relation with Spain and Latin American countries, as well as Hispanic communities in the United States.

First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more bitter taste. The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.\n\nFES is the Guinness variant that is most commonly found in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and it accounts for almost half of Guinness sales worldwide. Over four million hectolitres of the beer were sold in Africa in 2011, where Diageo intend to grow the product into the continent's highest selling beer.\n\nGuinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, hopped wort extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, is used for overseas production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. In most overseas markets, Guinness Flavour Extract (GFE) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES.\n\nFES was marketed in Nigeria as \"gives you power\" in the 1960s. This was updated for 1999–2006 with the Michael Power campaign, which aired across Africa. The beer is ranked highly on beer rating websites, while beer critics have varying opinions.\n\nGuinness West India Porter, the direct predecessor of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate Brewery in Dublin in 1801. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant workers in the Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats for up to two years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.\n\nThe first recorded shipment of the beer to the United States was in 1817. In 1827, the first official shipment of Guinness on the African continent arrived in Sierra Leone. The beer was renamed Foreign Extra Stout from around 1849 onwards. The first recorded exports to South East Asia began in the 1860s.\n\nFES accounted for around five per cent of all Guinness production at the turn of the twentieth century, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, retailing for double the price of domestic stouts. Total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads by 1912.\n\nThe American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was to prove unsuccessful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.\n\nGuinness export sales were mostly to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts prior to 1920. This changed from the 1920s onwards, and among the first natives to develop a taste for the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the Malay Peninsula. A global Guinness salesman was appointed by the company in 1924, and sales began to be pursued among native populations.\n\nIn 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the British War Office purchased 500,000 half-pint bottles of FES for distribution to hospitals.\n\nIn 1951, exports totalled 90,000 barrels, but by 1964 had grown to 300,000 barrels. By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to establish a joint venture in the country with the United Africa Company. By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 barrels exported to the country every year. This led the company to build a brewery in Ikeja in western Nigeria to supply the demand; it was only the third brewery in the company's history. The brewery cost over £2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the West Indies. Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.\n\nA new bottle design was debuted in Malaysia in 2005, and later rolled out worldwide. In 2013, FES received a packaging redesign in Africa and other selected markets, with a gold foil top and a new label.\n\nThe Irish version of FES is brewed with pale malt, 25 per cent flaked barley (for head retention and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, the latter being what gives the beer its dark hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. The beer contains about a third more hops, and nearly double the amount of roasted barley than Guinness Draught. The beer is force carbonated. The beer has 47 Bitterness Units.\n\nGuinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, hopped wort extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, is used for overseas production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley. Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.\n\nFES is produced at Diageo owned breweries in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Seychelles, Malaysia and Jamaica. In addition, it is produced under licence in 39 other countries. Diageo has brewing arrangements with the Castel Group to license brew and distribute Guinness in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Guinea.\n\nFES is the oldest variant of Guinness that is still available, although its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued to be added to the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.\n\nOriginally a bottle conditioned beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, in an attempt to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.\n\nForeign Extra Stout constitutes 45 per cent of total Guinness sales globally. Originally exported to British and Irish expatriates, from the 1920s the beer began to be drank by local populations. A 7.5% ABV version is sold throughout most of the world, although lower strength variants are found in some locations.\n\nThe beer is available in bottles and cans.\n\nIn Africa, the product retails at a premium price, with an up to 100 per cent higher cost than rival beers. 13 breweries in Africa brew FES. It is brewed and distributed by Guinness Nigeria, which is 58 per cent owned by Diageo, with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. As of 2012-13, Nigeria has been the largest market for Guinness by sales.\n\nFES was initially introduced into the Nigerian market through importation in the 1940s. Guinness in Nigeria is made from locally sourced sorghum or maize that has been heavily roasted. Some Nigerian versions also contain wheat. The switch from malted barley was made in 1986 when the Nigerian government briefly banned imports of the grain. The use of sorghum and maize continues as it is a cheaper alternative than barley, which has to be imported, and it is less vulnerable to local currency fluctuations. The Nigerian breweries use high gravity brewing techniques to ferment sorghum and pale malt to 1090 OG. Beer writer Roger Protz describes the Nigerian product as \"strikingly different\" from the Irish brewed version.\n\nThe brewing of FES has taken place at Sierra Leone Brewery Limited since October 1967.\n\nIn Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, which is 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE is mixed with a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it contains no wheat and has a higher proportion of roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.\n\nIn 2003, a 5.5% ABV, lightly-nitrogenated variant of FES was introduced in Ghana called Guinness Extra Smooth. It was released in Nigeria in 2005, where it constitutes 5-10 per cent of Guinness sales in the country.\n\nIn the year 2012 - 2013, sales of Guinness in South East Asia were over £100 million. \"FES\" (6.8% ABV) is brewed and distributed in Malaysia by Heineken Malaysia Berhad. The Malaysian variant is distributed throughout most of South East Asia. The brew was reduced in ABV from 8 to 6.8% in 2008. Malaysia is the largest Asian market for Guinness, where, in 2012, the brand grew by between 10 and 15 per cent. In Singapore, FES is brewed and distributed by Asia Pacific Breweries. In Indonesia, Guinness is brewed to 4.9% ABV by PT Multi Bintang (a subsidiary of Asia Pacific Breweries), and is distributed by PT Dima Indonesia. In China, small amounts of FES are sold, where it is positioned as a premium priced import in upmarket bars.\n\nFES was sold and then withdrawn in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout; it returned in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased. The beer was again withdrawn from the UK market, returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora. The British market is supplied with both the Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of the beer, the latter of which has annual sales of £2 million. Official imports of FES into the US were resumed in 2010, following a resurgent interest in craft beer; this was after a period of grey imports, predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates.\n\nIn the 1960s, FES was marketed in Nigeria as \"gives you power\" and its consumption was linked with an increase in sexual potency. This was updated for 1999-2006 with the Michael Power campaign, which aired all over the continent. Guinness credits the campaign with allowing the company to lead the Africa beer market by 50 per cent in 2000, experience volume growth of up to 50 per cent in some markets, achieve brand recognition of a reported 95 per cent, and by doubling Guinness sales in Africa by 2003. In 1999, Saatchi & Saatchi was given worldwide responsibility for marketing the FES brand. In October 2013, BBDO was awarded responsibility for marketing Guinness in Africa. Saatchi continues to market FES in the rest of the world. Since 2008, FES has been the largest sponsor of the Nigerian national football team.\n\nThe beer is ranked highly on beer rating websites. Garrett Oliver notes its refreshing qualities and \"distinctive acidic edge\". On the other hand, it has been criticised by British journalist Tony Naylor as being \"more about treacly, boozy warmth\" than \"complex flavour\".\n"}

The device facilitates the removal of lint or other small fibers from most materials such as clothing, upholstery and linen. Once expended, the roll can typically be replaced with a \"refill\" roll. Invented in 1956 by Nicholas McKay, Sr., his most well-known (and first commercial) product was the Lint Pic-Up, the world's first lint roller.\n\nReusable lint rollers use elastomers, including silicones and polystyrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene as a reusable tacky surface. \nThe material is similar to polymers used in walking toys such as Wacky WallWalker.\n\nA lint roller's design enables fast 360 degree rotation, which facilitates the easy removal of unsightly fiber (often animal hair). Lint rollers can be purchased in many sizes, from pet stores, supermarkets and online.\n\nThe product is popular among dog and cat owners, as it will also remove dog and cat hair from fabrics, carpets etc.\n\nA similar device, the lint brush uses a fabric cushion mounted to a handle, that when rubbed one way across the fabric to be cleaned, picks up the small fibers. By reversing the direction of movement across the fabric or by picking off the excess lint, it is possible to clean the lint brush. Some lint brushes are double sided in order to allow the brush to be used in both directions and to extend the use of the brush by limiting wear.\n"}

Dibbers come in a variety of designs including the straight dibber, T-handled dibber, trowel dibber, and L-shaped dibber.\n\nThe dibber was first recorded in Roman times and has remained mostly unchanged since. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, farmers would use long-handled dibbers of metal or wood to plant crops. One person would walk with a dibber making holes, and a second person would plant seeds in each hole and fill it in. It was not until the Renaissance that dibbers became a manufactured item, some made of iron for penetrating harder soils and clay.\n\nThis is the classic dibber. It is anything from a sharpened stick to a more complicated model incorporating a curved handle and pointed steel end. It may be made of wood, steel or plastic.\n\nThis dibber is much like the classic dibber, but with a T-grip that fits in the palm to make it easier to apply torque. This allows the user to exert even pressure creating consistent hole depth.\n\nThis dibber combines the features of a dibber and a trowel. It is usually forged from aluminum or other lightweight material. One end is for dibbing, and the other end is shaped like a trowel.\nBritish comedian Lee Mack donated a T-handled dibber to the British Lawnmower Museum, Southport, and spoke about it on the panel game show Would I Lie to You? (Series six, Episode three, first broadcast 27 April 2012 ).\n\nIn military parlance an aircraft-dropped 'dibber bomb' is an anti-runway penetration bomb which destroys runways by first penetrating below the tarmac before exploding, cratering, and displacing the surface making repairs difficult and time consuming during which conventional airplanes can neither land nor takeoff.\n\n\n"}

These parts are sometimes, but not always, morphemes.\n\nBlends abridge then combine lexemes to form a new word. Defining a true blend is complicated by the difficulty of determining which parts of the new word are \"recoverable\" (have roots which can be distinguished).\n\nBlends can be divided into three groups:\n\nMost blends are formed by one of the following methods:\n\nA blended word may undergo further modification in form or meaning over time, and the meanings of its parts can become obsolete. \"Malinger\" may have developed from a blend in old French of \"malade\" (ill), \"maigre\" (meager) and \"haingre\" (haggard).\nWhen two words are combined in their entirety, the result is considered a compound word rather than a blend. For example, bagpipe is a compound, not a blend, of \"bag\" and \"pipe.\"\n\nBlending can also apply to roots rather than words, for instance in Israeli Hebrew:\n\n\"There are two possible etymological analyses for Israeli Hebrew כספר \"kaspár\" 'bank clerk, teller'. The first is that it consists of (Hebrew>)Israeli כסף \"késef\" 'money' and the (International/Hebrew>)Israeli agentive suffix ר- \"-ár\". The second is that it is a quasi-portmanteau word which blends כסף \"késef\" 'money' and (Hebrew>)Israeli ספר √spr 'count'. Israeli Hebrew כספר \"kaspár\" started as a brand name but soon entered the common language. Even if the second analysis is the correct one, the final syllable ר- \"-ár\" apparently facilitated nativization since it was regarded as the Hebrew suffix ר- \"-år\" (probably of Persian pedigree), which usually refers to craftsmen and professionals, for instance as in Mendele Mocher Sforim's coinage סמרטוטר \"smartutár\" 'rag-dealer'.\"\n\nBlending may occur with an error in \"lexical selection\", the process by which a speaker uses his semantic knowledge to choose words. Lewis Carroll's explanation, which gave rise to the use of 'portmanteau' for such combinations, was:\n\nHumpty Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. For instance, take the two words \"fuming\" and \"furious.\" Make up your mind that you will say both words ... you will say \"frumious.\"\n\nThe errors are based on similarity of meanings, rather than phonological similarities, and the morphemes or phonemes stay in the same position within the syllable.\n\nSome languages, like Japanese, encourage the shortening and merging of borrowed foreign words (as in gairaigo), because they are long or difficult to pronounce in the target language. For example, \"karaoke\", a combination of the Japanese word \"kara\" (meaning \"empty\") and the clipped form \"oke\" of the English loanword \"orchestra\" (J. \"ōkesutora\" オーケストラ), is a Japanese blend that has entered the English language. The Vietnamese language also encourages blend words formed from Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. For example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of \"Việt Nam\" (Vietnam) and \"Cộng sản\" (communist).\n\nMany corporate brand names, trademarks, and initiatives, as well as names of corporations and organizations themselves, are blends. For example, Wiktionary, one of Wikipedia's sister projects, is a blend of \"wiki\" and \"dictionary\".\n\n\n\n"}

According to this story, they asked their cooks to recreate the sumptuous \"English trifle\" they had enjoyed in England at the Elizabethan court, where they were frequent visitors.\n\nTo make Zuppa Inglese, sponge cake or ladyfingers are dipped in Alchermes, a bright red, extremely aromatic Italian herb liqueur. They are then alternated with layers of \"crema pasticciera\", a thick egg custard cooked with a large piece of lemon zest (removed afterwards). Often there is also a layer of \"crema alla cioccolata\" made by dissolving dark chocolate in a plain crema pasticcera. In Italy it is occasionally topped with cream, meringue or almonds.\n\nZuppa Inglese is also a popular gelato flavour.\n\nThe word \"zuppa\" (soup) in Italian cuisine refers to both sweet and savoury dishes. It comes from the verb \"inzuppare\" which means \"to dunk\". As the sponge cake or Ladyfingers are dipped in liqueur the dish is called Zuppa.

{"id": "4074162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4074162", "title": "Grapette", "text": "Grapette\n\nGrapette is a [grape]]-flavored soft drink that was first produced and marketed in 1939 by Benjamin \"Tyndle\" Fooks. Grapette is now produced by Grapette International, and is marketed in the United States by Walmart as part of its Sam's Choice line of soft drinks.\n\nGrapette was developed by Benjamin \"Tyndle\" Fooks when, while working as a traveling salesman selling a product known as \"Fooks Flavors\", he noticed the popularity of his grape flavor. From this, Fooks, dissatisfied with existing grape sodas on the market, sought to develop a grape soda that tasted the way he believed that a grape soda should taste. Over the course of two years and tens of thousands of taste tests, by 1939, he had developed a flavor that he believed was superior to all other grape sodas available at the time.\n\nTo name the drink, Fooks turned to Hubert Owen. Owen and an assistant ran a local contest to come up with a name, but this failed to produce a suitable name. Owen then traveled to Washington, D.C. in 1939 to search the trademark files of the United States Patent Office for a suitable name. Here, it was found that a man named Rube Goldstein owned a trademark for the name \"Grapette\", \"Orangette\", and \"Lemonette\". Further research determined that Goldstein owned a small bottling firm that produced a drink that used one of Fooks' grape flavors, called \"Tiny\", which it distributed in Virginia and North Carolina, marketed in a six-ounce bottle. Goldstein, however, had never used the Grapette, Orangette, or Lemonette names. In March 1940, Fooks and Owen traveled to Chicago, Illinois to meet with Goldstein. There, they purchased the Grapette, Orangette, and Lemonette names for $500.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, Fooks began marketing his soda in Camden, Arkansas under the name \"Grapette\".\nGrapette's first-year sales were quite promising. This was due to Grapette's flavor, as well as Grapette's unique packaging. Most soft drinks at the time were sold in twelve-ounce bottles. Grapette was sold in a six-ounce clear glass bottle, which served to show off the beverage's purple color. With the success in sales, marketing of Grapette was expanded to much of the United States, and the slogan \"Thirsty or Not\" was developed for use in advertising. In addition, other flavors were developed, such as Orangette, an orange-flavored soda that used a considerable amount of real orange juice, and Lemonette, which contained a large amount of real lemon juice.\nWhen World War II began, Fooks dropped many of his other brands, such as Botl-O and Sunburst, in order to focus on Grapette. Sales of Grapette continued to soar during the war, despite restrictions and material shortages. Sugar, which was subject to wartime rationing, was obtained by adding water to granulated sugar, thus liquefying it, enabling it to be sold as syrup, which was not subject to rationing.\n\nIn 1942, R. Paul May, an Arkansas oil tycoon, persuaded Fooks to allow him to market Grapette in Latin America, citing a lack of soft drink options in the area. May was able to build a good reputation for Grapette in Guatemala, selling not only Grapette, but also Orangette and Lemonette. These brands soon became market leaders. In 1962, the export division of Grapette was reorganized into a separate company, known as Grapette International.\nIn 1962, Grapette introduced a line of cola drinks to compete with Coca-Cola under the name of \"Mr. Cola\". The drink was popular in large part because of its sixteen-ounce bottle. Mr. Cola was also available in ten and twelve-ounce sizes. In 1963, \"Lymette\" was added to Grapette's family of brands. Lymette, however, never achieved the commercial success of the other brands.\nBy the 1960s, Fooks believed that he had reached his limit with Grapette, and was ready to move on. By the end of the decade, Fooks had begun talks with groups interested in purchasing Grapette. Fooks ultimately sold Grapette to the Rheingold Corporation in 1970, which marketed the Rheingold, Ruppert-Knickerbocker, and Gablinger's lines of beers, as well as several regional brands of soft drinks in California, New Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Rheingold changed the name of the company from Grapette to Flavette, and relocated the company headquarters to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Grapette's bottle was changed to one with smooth sides and colored dots. The slogan became \"The Juicy Soda\". Grapette's advertising model also changed. Previously, advertising was funded by a surcharge on sugar, which was to be spent by the distributor for advertising only. This plan was dropped by Rheingold, placing advertising solely in the hands of Grapette's distributors, resulting in an immediate drop in sales. During this period, Flavette purchased the Dr. Wells soda pop brand and Mason & Mason, Inc., the makers of Mason's Root Beer.\n\nIn 1975, Rheingold was purchased by PepsiCo, Inc. in a hostile takeover, acquiring 80% of the company's stock. However, the Federal Trade Commission determined that PepsiCo controlled too many soft drink companies, and thus ordered that PepsiCo divest several prominent brands. When the divestiture was complete in 1977, Grapette was in the hands of The Monarch Beverage Company, which manufactured NuGrape. As Monarch already manufactured a grape soda, it was determined that they did not need a second. Representatives from Monarch flew to Grapette's headquarters and essentially fired the Grapette team. As such, the Grapette name was shelved, and the flavor was retired in the United States.\n\nDespite the brand's retirement in the United States, May retained ownership of Grapette International, and Grapette was still produced internationally, remaining a popular drink. When May died in the early 1970s, control of Grapette International was passed on to May's son-in-law, Brooks Rice.\n\nIn the United States, Grapette may have been gone, but it certainly had not been forgotten. Rice had made many offers to buy the American rights to Grapette back from Monarch, but regardless of the amount of money offered, Monarch refused to sell the name. Despite this setback, Rice continued to grow Grapette's market share elsewhere in the world, with sales in the tens of millions in countries in South America and the Pacific Rim.\n\nRice had profited by becoming an early investor in a business called Walmart, founded by Sam Walton. Over time, as Walmart grew into a household name, Rice began thinking of ways to partner with Walmart. In 1986, Rice was able to meet with Sam Walton, in order to discuss creating a line of private label soft drinks for Walmart. He was specifically interested in making a grape soda for Walmart. Walton did not waste words in telling Rice what he wanted: \"I want Grapette in my stores.\" While Rice did not have the American rights to the Grapette name, he was able to offer Grapette's flavor, and also promised that if he was able to reacquire the rights for the Grapette name, Walmart could have it.\n\nIn 1989, nearly three years after the initial meeting, Grapette International began producing a line of soft drinks for Walmart under the \"Ozark Farms\" name. The flavors available were cola, lemon-lime, grape, and orange. Each flavor used Fooks' original formulas. Thus Grapette returned to American shelves, albeit under a new name. However, sales were disappointing, and the Ozark Farms line of soft drinks was discontinued.\n\nWhen Sam Walton died in 1992, Walmart CEO David Glass felt it would be a fitting tribute to Walton to rename Walmart's private label as \"Sam's Choice\". In 1993, Rice again began manufacturing soft drinks for Walmart, this time under the Sam's Choice brand. Walmart was given exclusive rights to the flavors in the United States. Grapette was relaunched at this time as well, under the name \"Sam's Choice Grape\". Sam's Choice Grape soon became one of the best-selling grape sodas in the nation, seemingly proving Rice's claim that the flavor was what had made Grapette so popular, and not the drink's famous name.\n\nIn 2000, Rice walked into the Walmart Home Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, in order to personally deliver the news to David Glass: Monarch was finally selling the Grapette name. Rice told Glass, \"This is a tribute to you and Sam for having the vision on this product.\"\n\nBy late 2004, the Grapette and Orangette names (and original logotypes) had been incorporated into the Sam's Choice line of soft drinks, and had completely replaced the Sam's Choice Grape and Sam's Choice Orange brands in Walmart stores.\n\n\n\n"}

His good friend and teammate, Gustav Jaenecke, refused to play unless Ball was included. Ball also believed a deal could be struck to save his family in Germany if he returned to play in the games. The German selectors also realized that without Ball and Jaenecke the team would not stand a chance of winning. Another factor was that the Nazi party could not overlook the fact that Ball was without doubt one of the leading athletes in his sport. With much controversy Ball was included in the German team to play at the 1936 Olympic games. One report of the time proposed that Ball was playing against his will. The deal for Ball's family to leave Germany was also agreed. After Ball was injured, the Germans took 5th place in the Olympic tournament.

It was served with ortolans at a dinner given by Charles-Henri, Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre and Lieutenant-general of the Dauphiné, for the municipal officials of the town of Gap, now in the département of Hautes-Alpes.\n\nThe gratin dauphinois is made with raw potatoes, thinly sliced, and milk and/or cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic; for 1 kg of potatoes, about 600 ml of milk, 25 g of butter and a clove of garlic are needed. The potatoes are peeled and sliced to the thickness of a coin, preferably with a mandoline; they are layered in a shallow earthenware dish and cooked in a slow oven, at about 150 °C (300 °F), for more than an hour; the heat is raised for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.\n\nRecipes given by many authorities including Auguste Escoffier and Austin de Croze call for the addition of cheese and eggs to the dish; Robert Carrier and Constance Spry give recipes including these additions.\n\nThe dish is distinguished from \"gratin savoyard\" by not including cheese, and from ordinary gratin potatoes by the use of raw rather than boiled potatoes.

White Mountain was often called a wine cooler but was more accurately labeled a \"beer cooler\" by many as its base was an alcoholic malt beverage rather than wine. The beverage was very sweet and came in strong fruit flavors such as Wild Raspberry, Original Citrus, and Cranberry Splash that obscured the taste of its alcoholic base. It was considered a popular alternative to beer, and was often targeted toward women and younger audiences.\n\nWhite Mountain was sold in 12 oz. bottles, with an alcohol content similar to that of beer (approximately 5% ABV). It was also available on draft (draught) and in 32 and 40 oz. bottles in select markets.\n\nStrohs changed the formulation to a wine base shortly before discontinuing the product line. With Miller and Anheuser-Busch, Inc. exiting the cooler market in 1989 and 1987 respectively, White Mountain Cooler remained as the only brewery-produced wine cooler.\n\nIn March 1988, Stroh's began using the slogan, WHITE MOUNTAIN COOLER CRISP AND REFRESHING COLORADO PREMIUM COOLER COMPANY\nStroh's filed a U.S. federal trademark registration for it later that year in July 1988. It was registered in 1990, and canceled in 1996.\n\nRadio ads for White Mountain Cooler were mostly unscripted. An associate creative director at Grey Advertising assisted with the creation of the White Mountain Cooler Comedy Tour In 1990, Stroh's announced it would no longer be using Grey's for White Mountain Cooler advertising.\n\nCompetitors to White Mountain included Gallo's Bartles and Jaymes wine coolers, Seagrams Coolers, Brown Forman's California Cooler, Canandaigua Wine Company's Sun Country Wine Cooler, Miller Brewing Company's Matilda Bay Coolers and Anheuser-Busch's Dewey Stevens coolers and malt based beverages like G.Hielmans Champale and Malt Duck. Wine Cooler sales started to fall sharply by the end of the decade, and White Mountain along with the entire industry virtually disappeared in the early 1990s. The emergence of Zima as the new malternative marked the end of White Mountain. Miller and Anheuser Busch exited the wine cooler market. California Cooler and Sun Country ceased production. Gallo and Seagrams switched their Coolers to Malt based in the late 1980s.\n\nA renaissance in the malternative industry that began with Zima and continued through the late 1990s introducing brands such as Mike's Hard Lemonade and Smirnoff Ice has been marked by better advertising and crisper tasting products than the White Mountain Cooler. However, for many members of Generation X, White Mountain marked the genesis of beer-based beverages for people who did not like to drink beer.\n\n"}

{"id": "4142376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4142376", "title": "Springerle", "text": "Springerle\n\nSpringerle is a type of German biscuit with an embossed design made by pressing a mold onto rolled dough and allowing the impression to dry before baking. This preserves the detail of the surface pattern. While historical molds show that springerle were baked for religious holidays and secular occasions throughout the year, they are now most commonly associated with the Christmas season.\n\nThe name \"springerle\" translates literally as \"little jumper\" or \"little knight\", but its exact origin is unknown. It may refer the popular motif of a jumping horse in the mold, or just to the rising or \"springing up\" of the dough as it bakes. The origin of the cookie can be traced back to at least the 14th century in southwestern Germany and surrounding areas, mostly in Swabia.\n\nThe major ingredients of springerle are eggs, white (wheat) flour, and very fine or powdered sugar. The biscuits are traditionally anise-flavored, although the anise is not usually mixed into the dough; instead it is dusted onto the baking sheets so that the biscuit sits on top of the crushed anise seeds.\n\nTraditional springerle recipes use hartshorn salt (ammonium carbonate, or baker's ammonia) as a leavening agent. Since hartshorn salt can be difficult to find, many modern recipes use baking powder as the leavening agent. Springerle made with hartshorn salt are lighter and softer than those made with baking powder. The hartshorn salt also imparts a crisper design and longer shelf-life to the springerle. The leavening causes the biscuit to at least double in height during baking.\n\nTo make springerle, very cold, stiff dough is rolled thin and pressed into a mold, or impressed by a specialized, carved rolling pin. The dough is unmolded and then left to dry for about 24 hours before being baked at a low temperature on greased, anise-dusted baking sheets. The drying period allows time for the pattern in the top of the cookie to set, so that the cookie has a \"pop-up\" effect from leavening, producing the characteristic \"foot\" along the edges, below the molded surface.\n\nThe baked biscuits are hard, and are packed away to ripen for two or four weeks. During this time, they become tender.\n\nAnother method of making springerle is to not chill the dough at all. Commonly, after mixing all the ingredients together, one would cover a surface with flour, and use a regular rolling pin (also covered in flour) to roll out the dough to about half-an-inch of thickness. Flour would be spread over the top surface of the rolled-out dough, and also on the specialized Springerle rolling pin. One would whack the Springerle rolling pin against one's hand a few times, to dislodge any flour caked into the designs on it, and then proceed to carefully but firmly roll out the molds. One uses a knife to cut out the small, rectangular cookies (often 2x1 inches), and place them on a wooden board to dry overnight (or for at least twelve hours). As this process is repeated, the dough gets more brittle due to the added flour and doesn't hold the molds as well. Therefore, it is important to roll the dough out in small batches (instead of all at once), to keep the moisture in so the cookies hold together. Anise seed is sprinkled on the baking sheets just before putting them in the oven (about ten minutes is usually sufficient, but the cooking time also depends on thickness). 1-2 teaspoons of anise extract can also be added to the dough to increase the taste (which is rather like licorice), and the amount of cookies varies on the thickness. The usual recipe with 4 eggs and 3-4 cups of flour can yield anywhere from 60-144 cookies, depending on thickness and the experience of the maker.\n\nMolds are traditionally carved from wood, although plastic and pottery molds are also available. Pear wood is prized for its density and durability. Older handmade molds are folk art, are typically unsigned, and undated.\n\nThe stamping technique may be derived from the molds used in some Christian traditions to mark sacramental bread, and the earliest molds featured religious motifs, including scenes from Bible stories and Christian symbols. Later, in the 17th and 18th century, heraldic themes of knights and fashionably dressed ladies became popular. Themes of happiness, love, weddings, and fertility remained popular through the 19th century.\n\n"}

The dough is rolled and then pulled into small, tight overhand knots, and pre-baked in a pizza oven (temperatures of 700 °F or higher). The knots are then dipped in or generously brushed with a mix of oil, Parmesan cheese, and crushed garlic; variations can include finely chopped parsley, dried oregano, or black pepper. Before serving, garlic knots are baked a second time, and may be accompanied by marinara sauce.\n"}

Salads prepared with this method should be used within a year for best quality. \n\nCultures around the world have their own version of bean salad. Balela is a Middle Eastern salad that typically uses chickpeas and black beans with tomatoes, herbs, and lemon juice. South American bean salad features poroto beans with tomatoes, parsley, oil and vinegar, and is served with grilled steak. \n\nIt is common in some parts of the United States to refer to this sort of salad by the number of different beans it contains, e.g. \"three bean salad\" or \"four bean salad.\" The generic term \"bean salad\" can also be used to refer to related dishes, like variants containing starches such as barley, pasta, or rice.\n\nSince at least the 19th century, salads using cooked beans have been commonly used for picnics and outings. \n\nThe principal ingredients, the beans, have already been cooked and the vinaigrette helps to temporarily preserve the dish without refrigeration.

Several early recipes also include anchovies. A variety of dressings may be used with this salad.\n\nFood historians do not agree on the history and composition of chef salad, much less who assembled the first one. Some trace this salad's roots to Salmagundi, a popular meat and salad dish originating in 17th century England and popular in colonial America. Others contend chef's salad is a product of early twentieth century, originating in either New York or California. The person most often connected with the history of this salad is Louis Diat, chef of the Ritz-Carlton in New York City during the 1940s. While food historians acknowledge his recipe, they do not appear to be convinced he originated the dish, which is more popularly attributed to either chef Victor Seydoux at the Hotel Buffalo, a Statler Hotel in Buffalo, New York or to chef Jacques Roser at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City. Roser worked in various culinary positions in Paris before being invited to become head chef at the prestigious 1920s Hotel Pennsylvania, where he worked for over fifteen years. Seydoux first learned his craft in Montreux, Switzerland, and continued his studies in France and England before coming to work in the United States.\n\nSeydoux's first experiences in the U.S. included positions at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and the Ritz-Carlton. Although the origin of the salad is not generally known, as reported by Alice Rose Seydoux, widow of Victor, the salad was officially launched at the Hotel Buffalo. When the customers started requesting the off-menu salad made with cuts of meat, cheese and hard boiled eggs, the hotel decided to add it to the menu. Giving chef Seydoux the honor of naming the salad he is purported to have said \"Well, it's really a chef's salad.\"\n\nThe chef salad probably owes much of its popularity, according to Evan Jones in \"American Food: The Gastronomic Story\" (1975), to Louis Diat, chef at the Ritz-Carlton. \"Cooking a la Ritz\" includes Diat's recipe: \"Chef's salad. Place separately in a salad bowl equal amounts of chopped lettuce (place on the bottom of the bowl), boiled chicken, smoked ox tongue and smoked ham, all cut in julienne style. Add 1/2 hard-cooked egg for each portion. Place some watercress in the center and serve with French Dressing.\" Diat did not invent the salad (older recipes exist), but its inclusion on the menu at the Ritz-Carlton would have introduced the salad to more of the public. It is possible that the inclusion of Thousand Island dressing is also linked to the Ritz, since the hotel also introduced the dressing to New York City. This recipe, while containing smoked ox tongue, still contains the primary chef salad ingredients: meat, eggs, greens, as well as its presentation: julienne sliced meat and sliced eggs. Several other early chef salad recipes mention crumbling Roquefort cheese over the salad.\n\nThe 1936 2nd printing of \"The Joy of Cooking\" is the first known printed recipe for a \"Chef Salad\" and cites many ingredients found in later Chef Salad recipes (but no meat). On page 51 of his 1926 book “The Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book” author Arnold Shircliffe gives a recipe for the “Cook’s Salad” which employs many ingredients of later Chef Salads, including the garlic-rubbed salad bowl. In a note following the 1926 recipe, Shircliffe shares a story on the origin of the \"Cook’s Salad\" in which he also references the “chef’s salad bowl,” though no biographical data is given: \n\n“\"While passing through a kitchen one day, I found the above mixture in huge bowl in the center of the chef’s table, and being friendly to salads as well as cooks, I requested a sample and was served very liberally. The salad was delicious ; in fact it was a sort of master composition and deserving of an appropriate name. As nothing but the best of everything enters into the food materials supplied to chef's table, the salad was born and named “Cook’s Salad.’’ I have been more or less successful in ordering this particular salad; but if I wish to get this salmagundy right I order it from the chef’s table and not the salad pantry. The chef’s salad bowl is generally rubbed with garlic.\"”\n\n\n"}

The flavor and aroma of Budu are produced by the action of proteolytic microorganisms surviving during the fermentation process. Palm sugar and tamarind are usually added to promote a browning reaction, resulting in a dark brown hue. The ratio of fish to salt is key to the final desired product. Different concentrations of salt influences the microbial and enzymatic activity, resulting in different flavours. The microorganisms found during Budu production are generally classified as halophilic. The microorganisms play important roles in protein degradation and flavour and aroma development.\n\nBudu is a traditional condiment among the ethnic Popnips of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the state of Kelantan and Terengganu. Budu has been declared a Malaysian heritage food by the Malaysian Department of National Heritage. Even ethnic Chinese in Kelantan are involved in Budu production. Anchovy and its products like budu are high in protein and uric acid, thus not recommended for people with gout. The uric acid content in anchovies, however, is lower than that in tuna.\n\nBudu made from anchovy sauce has shown potential as an anti-cancer agent.\n\nBudu also as a food sourced from fish have potential as brain food.\n\nA new form of budu in powder form has been developed by a Politeknik Kota Bharu (PKB) student.

It is also considered to be traditional food in Czech, Slovak and Croatian cuisine and is also very common in Poland, Austria, and Israel.\n\nMost Hungarian recipes recommend the mildest variant of Hungarian wax pepper, which are in season August–October which is also when field tomatoes are at their best. Other recipes suggest using both bell pepper and banana pepper as alternatives.\n\nThere is a large variety of lecsós, the base of all being a mixture of tomatoes and peppers (both sweet and hot), onions, spiced with salt, some variants also sugar, a fair amount of red paprika powder and often garlic. Some recipes may also use bay leaf, ground black pepper or thyme. To make the perfect lecsó base, one must render the lard from the smoked bacon (if that is used instead of oil, which is also common), and fry the onion slices until the edges become slightly brownish. Next the pepper slices must be added and fried until crisp. The tomatoes come last because, if added at the beginning, they would soak the onions and the peppers.\n\nLecsó may be made with potatoes, cooked rice or egg barley (called tarhonya). Another accompaniment which is quite common is nokedli (similar to spaetzle). It is possible to make lecsó with green tomatoes, cold lecsó in aspic, and to serve the warm dish with sour cream or in a pancake, as a filling. Some recipes are with meat, sausage (called \"kolbász\" such as lecsókolbász, made specifically for this purpose, or Debrecener sausage) bacon or smoked pork chops, liver and sliced hot dog sausages. Some are decorated with slices of hard-boiled egg or thickened with beaten eggs. Even cabbage and pumpkin may be added at times. If meat is added, it may be added first, and fried with the onions and pepper slices.\nLecsó, like its French semi-counterpart ratatouille, often stands alone as a lunch dish, in which case it is often consumed with bread.

The family takes its alternative name (Cruciferae, New Latin for \"cross-bearing\") from the shape of their flowers, whose four petals resemble a cross.\n\nTen of the most common cruciferous vegetables eaten by people, known colloquially in North America as cole crops and in Britain and Ireland as \"brassicas\", are in a single species (\"Brassica oleracea\"); they are not distinguished from one another taxonomically, only by horticultural category of cultivar groups. Numerous other genera and species in the family are also edible. Cruciferous vegetables are one of the dominant food crops worldwide. They are high in vitamin C and soluble fiber and contain multiple nutrients and phytochemicals.\n\nExtensive selective breeding has produced a large variety of cultivars, especially within the genus \"Brassica\". One description of genetic factors involved in the breeding of \"Brassica\" species is the Triangle of U.\n\nCruciferous vegetables contain glucosinolates which are under basic research for their potential properties of affecting some types of cancer. Glucosinolates are hydrolyzed to isothiocyanates (ITCs) by the action of myrosinase. ITCs, possibly a bioactive component in cruciferous vegetables, are being investigated for their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects. As one example in laboratory research, ITCs such as phenethyl isothiocyanate reduced levels of the oncoprotein MCL1. Other in vitro research indicates ITCs may affect levels of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, the oncoprotein affecting mechanisms of leukemia.\n\nChemicals contained in cruciferous vegetables induce the expression of the liver enzyme CYP1A2. Furthermore, some drugs such as haloperidol and theophylline are metabolized by CYP1A2. Consequently, consumption of cruciferous vegetables may decrease bioavailability and half-life of these drugs.\n\nAlliaceous and cruciferous vegetable consumption may induce glutathione S-transferases, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferases, and s all of which are potentially involved in detoxification of carcinogens such as aflatoxin. High consumption of cruciferous vegetables has potential risk from allergies, interference with drugs like warfarin and genotoxicity.\n\nPeople who can taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), which is either bitter or tasteless, are less likely to eat cruciferous vegetables, due to the resemblance between isothiocyanates and PTC.\n\nAlthough cruciferous vegetables are generally safe for human consumption, individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivities to a certain \"Brassica\" vegetable, or those taking anticoagulant therapy, require caution before consuming such vegetables.\n\n"}

Bougatsa is also popular in Veria and Halkidiki (also in northern Greece) and Chania and Iraklion in the island of Crete. In Chania, it is called \"bougatsa Chanion\" and is made by special pastry shops usually open from early morning until noon. The most common filling is a sweet semolina custard. Common savory fillings include mizithra cheese or minced meat. In Iraklion, the most famous is made by shops on Morosini Square, by the descendants of Armenian refugees from Asia Minor.\n\nThe taste of bougatsa varies between regions of Greece. For example, bougatsa in Veria is very sweet and full of cream, while in Thessaloniki it is crunchy and not that sweet.\n\nThe name comes from the Byzantine Greek πογάτσα (pogátsa), from the ancient Roman \"panis focacius\"; \"c.f.\" Italian \"focaccia,\" Turkish \"poğaça,\" \"etc.\"\n\nGreek bougatsa is prepared from phyllo dough wrapped around a filling.

In Spain the term refers to blancmange, a European delicacy found in various parts of the continent as well as the United Kingdom. In the Americas (South America primarily) it refers to a sweet, white spread or pastry filling made with milk. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with \"dulce de leche\" or \"cajeta\" in Latin America but these terms generally refer to delicacies prepared differently from those just described. Related dishes exist by other names in other countries, such as tembleque in Puerto Rico. In Portuguese-speaking countries the dish is known as \"manjar branco\".\n\nManjar blanco in Spain and in other parts of Europe refers to a dessert (\"blancmange\" in English), traditionally light brown in color (although often colored by added ingredients), made with a mould with a consistency like gelatin (in fact modern varieties are often made with gelatin). In the Middle Ages, the dish was prepared with chicken or fish, rice, sugar, and almond milk or milk and other ingredients (the dish was probably influenced by the Arab cuisine of Muslim Spain). Today the primary ingredients in Spain tend to be milk, almonds, corn starch or gelatin, and sugar. The variants in Spain are often somewhat different from those in France or the United Kingdom.\n\nThis term is used in Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina (not to be confused with \"natillas\" which is a similar but separate dish). It refers to a set of similar dishes traditionally made by slowly and gently cooking pure (normally non-homogenized) milk to thicken and reduce the volume, and gradually adding sugar. In some regions other ingredients such as vanilla, citrus juices, cinnamon, and even rice may also be added. Usually a double boiler of some sort is employed so as to prevent browning of the mixture (which would give it a different flavor). The result is a white or cream-colored, thick spread with a consistency much like that of a thick cake frosting although the flavor is more like that of sweetened cream (with accents of whatever additional ingredients may have been added). The cooking process is largely the same as for creating sweetened condensed milk except that the result is normally thicker.\n\nAlthough manjar blanco can be used as spread much like jelly or jam is used in the U.S., it is also commonly used as a filling for pastries and cookies such as \"alfajores\" and tejas.\n\nIn Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries in Central America \"manjar de leche\" is a pudding or custard made with milk, cornstarch (to thicken), sugar, and often other ingredients such as vanilla, cinnamon or other flavorings. This white-colored confection may be eaten by itself or used as a pastry filling. In Costa Rica, the term \"natilla\" refers to a cultured buttermilk-like product with a butterfat content ranging from 12% (\"liviana\") to 14%, sold in stores in plastic pouches. It is used as a condiment on such dishes as gallo pinto, baked potatoes, steamed vegetables and the like.\n\nManjar blanco is a traditional Christmas dish in Colombia, along with natilla. It is made out of ingredients like milk, rice, and sugar; which are heated for a long period of time until the right texture is achieved. Manjar blanco is usually eaten with a slice of natilla, buñuelos, and hojuelas, creating a very good combination from the salty buñuelos with the two sweet desserts. Manjar blanco can be found in stores during Christmas time, but is also found in stores throughout the year...\n\nManjar blanco in Puerto Rico is known as \"natilla\" (pronounced nah-tee’-ya) and is classified as a cold custard dessert. Natilla is made with cornstarch, vanilla, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, cinnamon, milk, and evaporated milk. It is typically served on Christmas in small cups with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Natilla can be bought all year around in supermarkets and convenience stores as a prepackaged powder that can be prepared by simply heating with milk. A less sweet version made with honey and more milk is enjoyed for breakfast in Puerto Rico, and served topped with fruit and cinnamon.\n\nA local adaptation of this dessert is called \"maja blanca\", and uses coconut milk instead of milk. It also contains corn kernels, and this variation is known as \"maja blanca con maiz\"\n\n\n"}

The inner center of each gusher is a thick, sweet liquid surrounded by a chewy gummy-like colored sugared covering. When one bites into the snack, the liquid inside \"gushes\" out, hence the name \"gushers\". Fruit Gushers was the major sponsor for the YTV game show \"Uh Oh!\" from 2001 until the series ended in 2003.\n\nIngredients for the \"Strawberry Splash\" flavor are: pears from concentrate, sugar, dried corn syrup, corn syrup, modified corn starch, fructose, grape juice from concentrate. Ingredients making up less than 2% of the product are: partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, maltodextrin, cottonseed oil, carrageenan, citric acid, glycerin, monoglycerides, sodium citrate, malic acid, ascorbic acid, natural flavor, potassium citrate, agar-agar, Red 40, xanthan gum.\n\nGushers originally came in two flavors: \"Gushin' Grape\" and \"Strawberry Splash\"; grape was discontinued in 2017.\n\nA variety of the snack is \"Gushers Mood Morphers\", which come in a \"Fruit Punch\" flavor with differently colored fruit-flavored fillings.\n\nAnother variety that was developed is \"Hawaiian Punch\". These Gushers are the same shape as the original Fruit Gushers and contain three fruit flavored candy snacks: \"Pineapple Paradise\", \"Watermelon Luau\", and \"Maui Mango\". They are not currently for sale in all states and regions of the US.\n\nThe case was \"Annie Lam v. General Mills, Inc.\", Case No. 11-cv-5056, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California.[https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/1419-general-mills-fruit-snack-class-action-lawsuit/ ]\n\nThe class action lawsuit took aim at General Mills’ misleading marketing claims that its sugary fruit snacks were healthy. Marketing phrases like “a good source of vitamin C,” “low-fat” and “gluten-free” on the packaging for Fruit By The Foot, Fruit Roll-Ups and Fruit Gushers implies that the snacks promote good health, when they’re actually chock full of high-fructose corn syrup, preservatives and trans fats, the lawsuit says. [https://cspinet.org/news/general-mills-facing-class-action-lawsuit-over-fruit-snacks-full-sugars-partially-hydrogenated ] Obscured on labels is the fact that the so-called fruit snacks are mostly sugars (some from fruit concentrate and some from corn syrup), artificial additives, and potentially harmful artificial dyes.\n\nThe lawsuit citied the ingredient lists of the fruit candies using Strawberry Fruit Roll-Ups as an example. Strawberry Fruit Roll-Ups are made from pears from concentrate, corn syrup, dried corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, citric acid, acetylated monoglycerides, fruit pectin, dextrose, malic acid, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), unspecified “natural flavor,” and Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 1. Even with the pear ingredient, the product provides little of the beneficial fiber or nutrients associated with real strawberries. While labels tout the naturalness of the added flavorings, CSPI says that many of the ingredients are artificial by anyone’s definition, including the partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil and the acetylated monoglycerides. The side panels on some General Mills \"fruit\" candies read \"Made With Real Fruit.\" At least one variety of Fruit Roll-Ups has pictures of strawberries and oranges on the box. But despite the names of the products, there are no strawberries in Strawberry Fruit Roll-Ups, nor watermelon in Fruit Gushers Watermelon Blast. The bright colors of those products come from synthetic, petroleum-based dyes that can impair some children’s behavior.\n\n“Unfortunately for consumers and their children, all of [General Mills’] claims of healthfulness are false and misleading,” the General Mills fruit snacks lawsuit states.\n\n“General Mills is basically dressing up a very cheap candy as if it were fruit and charging a premium for it,” said CSPI litigation director Steve Gardner. “General Mills is giving consumers the false impression that these products are somehow more wholesome, and charging more. It’s an elaborate hoax on parents who are trying to do right by their kids.”\n\nAccording to the complaint, filed in United States District Court in the Northern District of California, the presence of partially hydrogenated oil in “fruit” snacks marketed as healthy and wholesome is deceptive. The artificial trans fat in partially hydrogenated oil lowers HDL, or “good” cholesterol, raises LDL, or “bad” cholesterol. CSPI states that the amounts of trans fat are small, but that they have no place in a product marketed as if it were healthful and a source of fruit.\n\nThe General Mills fruit snacks class action lawsuit is filed by the Center for Science and Public Interest (CSPI) on behalf of all U.S. consumers who purchased General Mills fruit snacks and other related products between October 15, 2005 and 2011. It is seeking restitution and damages for Class Members, injunctive relief and more for Unfair, Deceptive and Fraudulent Acts and Practices; Misleading and Deceptive Advertising; Breach of Express Warranty and Unjust Enrichment.\n\nThe complaint contends that the labeling of fruit-flavored snacks violates various state laws, including Minnesota’s Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, and several California laws governing misleading and deceptive advertising and fraudulent business practices. General Mills is based in Golden Valley, Minnesota.\n\nGeneral Mills has a habit of skirting the truth with its marketing and advertising, according to CSPI. In 2009, the Food and Drug Administration took enforcement action against the company for making misleading cholesterol-lowering and cancer-prevention claims on Cheerios packages. Before resorting to litigation, CSPI had privately urged General Mills to change its “fruit” snacks labels, but without success.\n\n4. ^ “General Mills Fruit Class Action Lawsuit” \"Topclassactions.com\". 18 October 2011\n\n5. ^ “General Mills facing class action over ‘fruit snacks’ full of sugars, partially hydrogenated oil, & dyes” \"CSPINET.org\". 14 October 2011\n\n6. ^ “Food Dyes” \"CSPINET.org.\"\n\n"}

Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the National Brewing Company and its brands (including Colt 45) are today owned by the Pabst Brewing Company.\n\nColt 45 is available today in a multitude of packages and sizes. Bobby Brooks was the first sales representative to introduce the 22 oz Colt 45 Bottle, known as Double Deuce 22. He introduced the 22 oz bottle in the State of Georgia. Cans are available in 12-, 16- and 24-ounce packages and bottles are available in 7-, 12-, 16-, 18-, 22-, 32-, and 40-ounce packages. Cans are available in multi-packs including: 6-, 12-, 15-, 18-, 24-, 30-, 36-, and 42-packs of 12-ounce cans.\n\nNational Brewing Company introduced Colt 45 in 1963. Previously, the only major national brand of malt liquor was Country Club. The label was designed with a kicking horse and horseshoe, a reference to its \"extra kick\" compared to competing brands. \nListed on the Pabst website as a \"Fun Fact\", Colt 45 was named after running back #45 Jerry Hill of the 1963 Baltimore Colts and not the .45 caliber handgun ammunition round.\n\nThroughout most of the 60s and 70s, Colt 45 was marketed towards the suburban white-collar middle class demographic. To this end, in a memorable ad campaign that lasted over 15 years, Billy Van portrayed a gentleman in suit and tie patiently sitting at a table, unfazed by all the chaos around him, until a waiter showed up with a schooner glass and a can of Colt 45. Music resembling \"Song of the Nairobi Trio\" played in the background while a voice-over announcer intoned:\n\nIn subsequent commercials, the scenarios became more and more outlandish and amplified the chaos, including a busy beach, an airport runway, a bullfighting ring (during a bullfight), and the bottom of a ski jump, the latter featuring a cameo by Redd Foxx; the one constant in each commercial was Van who remained unperturbed while sitting at the table. Van won a 1975 Clio Award for one of these commercials.\n\nBy 1978, the \"waiting man\" commercials were briefly replaced with more contemporary ads and the slogan \"That Dynamite Taste\", and featured a then-unknown Ted Danson in one of the commercials. Beginning in 1980, Colt 45 began a long association with actor Billy Dee Williams, who also appeared in their print and billboard ads as well as on television. The product's slogan during that era, as stated by Williams in his television commercials, was, \"It works every time.\" Williams responded indifferently to criticism of his appearances in the liquor commercials.\n\nColt 45 makers experimented briefly with a mint-flavored derivative, marketed under the name Cool Colt, in the early 1990s. Available in limited quantities, it was largely met with puzzlement from loyal customers. While it was in production, the slogan for Cool Colt was \"Taste the Cool.\"\n\nA double malt version—titled Colt 45 Double Malt—is also produced; and in certain regions, such as Montana, has 8.5% abv. Sold in only certain regions, the label is distinguishable by two horseshoes rather than the standard single one.\n\nIn 2011, Pabst Brewing introduced Blast by Colt 45. Snoop Dogg signed on to promote the beverage as Blast's \"brand ambassador\". The 12% ABV fruit-flavored malt beverage has been criticized for targeting underage drinkers. In order to cooperate with FDA regulations, Blast by Colt does not contain caffeine, taurine, or guarana.\n"}

{"id": "4224582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4224582", "title": "Japanese whisky", "text": "Japanese whisky\n\nJapanese whisky is a style of whisky developed and produced in Japan. Whisky production in Japan began around 1870, but the first commercial production was in 1924 upon the opening of the country's first distillery, Yamazaki. Broadly speaking the style of Japanese whisky is more similar to that of Scotch whisky than other major styles of whisky.\n\nThere are several companies producing whisky in Japan, but the two best-known and most widely available are Suntory and Nikka. Both of these produce blended as well as single malt whiskies and blended malt whiskies, with their main blended whiskies being Suntory , and Black Nikka Clear. There are also a large number of special bottlings and limited editions.\n\nTwo of the most influential figures in the history of Japanese whisky are Shinjiro Torii and Masataka Taketsuru. Torii was a pharmaceutical wholesaler and the founder of Kotobukiya (later to become Suntory). He started importing western liquor and he later created a brand called \"Akadama Port Wine\", based on a Portuguese wine which made him a successful merchant. However, he was not satisfied with this success and so he embarked on a new venture which was to become his life's work: making Japanese whisky for Japanese people. Despite the strong opposition from the company's executives, Torii decided to build the first Japanese whisky distillery in Yamazaki, a suburb of Kyoto, an area so famous for its excellent water that the legendary tea master Sen no Rikyū built his tearoom there.\n\nTorii hired Masataka Taketsuru as a distillery executive. Taketsuru had studied the art of distilling in Scotland, and brought this knowledge back to Japan in the early 1920s. Whilst working for Kotobukiya he played a key part in helping Torii establish the Yamazaki Distillery. In 1934 he left Kotobukiya to form his own company—Dainipponkaju—which would later change its name to Nikka. In this new venture he established the Yoichi distillery in Hokkaidō.\n\nThe first westerners to taste Japanese whisky were soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force Siberia who took shore leave in Hakodate in September 1918. A brand called Queen George, described by one American as a \"Scotch whiskey made in Japan\", was widely available. Exactly what it was is unknown, but it was quite potent and probably quite unlike Scotch whisky.\n\nAs of 2011, when the Shinshu distillery reopened, there are around nine active whisky distilleries in Japan. These include:\n\n\n\nFor some time it was believed by many that whisky made in the Scottish style, but not produced in Scotland, could not possibly measure up to the standards of the traditional Scotch whisky distilleries. Before 2000, the market for Japanese whiskies was almost entirely domestic, though this changed in 2001 when Nikka's 10-year Yoichi single malt won \"Best of the Best\" at \"Whisky Magazine\"s awards.\n\nIn the blind tasting organized by \"Whisky Magazine\" in 2003, the results of which are published in WM #30, the winners of the category \"Japanese Whiskies\" were:\nIn the main ranking (covering all categories of whisky) Hibiki 21 YO made it to rank 9 and Nikka Yoichi 10 to rank 14.\nIn 2004, the 18-year-old Yamazaki was introduced to the US. \nJapanese whiskies have been winning top honors in international competitions, notably Suntory. At the 2003 International Spirits Challenge, Suntory Yamazaki won a gold medal, and Suntory whiskies continued to win gold medals every year through 2013, with all three malt whiskies winning a trophy (the top prize) in either 2012 (Yamazaki 18 years old and Hakushu 25 years old) or 2013 (Hibiki 21 years old), and Suntory itself winning distiller of the year in 2010, 2012, and 2013. The resultant acclaim nudged Japan's distilleries to market overseas.\n\nFurther, in recent years (as of 22 March 2014) a number of blind tastings have been organized by \"Whisky Magazine\", which have included Japanese single malts in the lineup, along with malts from distilleries considered to be among the best in Scotland. On more than one occasion, the results have had Japanese single malts (particularly those of Nikka's Yoichi and Suntory's Yamazaki) scoring higher than their Scottish counterparts.\n\nThe production of Japanese whisky began as a conscious effort to recreate the style of Scotch whisky. Pioneers like Taketsuru carefully studied the process of making Scotch whisky, and went to great lengths in an attempt to recreate that process in Japan. The location of Yoichi in Hokkaidō was chosen particularly for its terrain and climate, which were in many ways reminiscent of Scotland (although financial constraints resulted in the first distillery actually being built in the more convenient location of Yamazaki on the main island).\n\nOne facet of the style of Japanese whisky comes from the way in which blended whisky is produced, and the differing nature of the industry in Japan. Despite the recent rise of interest in single malt whiskies, the vast majority of whisky sold in the world is still blended. In Scotland, while a particular brand of blended whisky may be owned by a company that also owns one or more distilleries, it is common for blended whisky bottlers to trade single malt whiskies. The components of a blend may involve malt whisky from a number of distilleries, which may be owned by different companies. In Japan, however, the industry is vertically integrated, meaning whisky companies own both the distilleries and the brands of blended whiskies, and do not trade with their competitors. So a blended whisky in Japan will generally only contain malt whisky from the distilleries owned by that same company.\n\nJapanese whisky is consumed either like Scottish whisky or like Japanese shōchū. The bulk of Japanese blended whisky is consumed in cocktails, notably as whisky (similar to shōchū highballs, known as chūhai), while fine whisky is primarily drunk neat or on the rocks, as with Scotch whisky. Advertising for blended whisky generally features it consumed in a highball, and highballs made with Suntory's Kakubin are branded .\n\nIn addition to soda (in a highball), Japanese whisky is often drunk mixed with hot water , particularly in winter, or cold water , particularly in summer, as is done with shōchū. Whisky is also commonly drunk with food, particularly in mixed drinks, especially highballs. The prevalence of mixing whisky with soda or water is particularly attributed to the hot, muggy Japanese summer, hence the popularity of long drinks.\n\n\n"}

For hundreds of years, Kazakhs were herders who raised fat-tailed sheep, Bactrian camels, and horses, relying on these animals for transportation, clothing, and food. The cooking techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's nomadic way of life. For example, most cooking techniques are aimed at long-term preservation of food. There is a large practice of salting and drying meat so that it will last, and there is a preference for sour milk, as it is easier to save in a nomadic lifestyle.\n\nMeat in various forms has always been the primary ingredient of Kazakh cuisine, and traditional Kazakh cooking is based on boiling. Horse and mutton are the most popular forms of meat and are most often served in large uncut pieces, which have been boiled. Kazakhs cared especially for horses which they intended to slaughter—keeping them separate from other animals and feeding them so much that they often became so fat they had difficulty moving.\n\nThe base of Kazakh cuisine is () – four kinds of cattle (i.e. four kinds of meat): horses, camels, cows, and sheep. Horse meat is the main festive meat, while sheep's meat is used as common meat. Camel meat is also a kind of festive meat, but not the main (as camels in Kazakhstan are not as common as horses). Cow's meat is also a kind of common meat.\n\n, a dish consisting of boiled horse or mutton meat, is the most popular Kazakh dish. It is also called \"five fingers\" because of the way it is eaten. The chunks of boiled meat are cut and served by the host in order of the guests’ importance. is usually eaten with a boiled pasta sheet, and a meat broth called , and is traditionally served in Kazakh bowls called . is another Kazakh's national dish. \n\nOther popular meat dishes are (which is a horse meat sausage that only the wealthy could afford), (horse meat sausages), (also spelled , a dish made from roasted horse, sheep, or cow offal, with the heart, liver, kidneys, and other organs, diced and served with onions and peppers), and various horse delicacies, such as (smoked lard from horse's neck) and (salted and smoked meat from horse's hip and hind leg). Another popular dish is pilaf (), which is made from meat fried with carrots, onions or garlic, then cooked with rice.\n\n, also known as crackler, is melted fat in a large bowl with sugar, eaten by dipping it with bread and is often served with tea. is a sausage made during fall and winter slaughtering and is made by stuffing intestines with pieces of ground meat, fat, blood, garlic, salt, and black pepper. , also known as kebab, is popular among hunters and travelers and is a dish in which small pieces of meat are roasted over a fire. is a dish made from the heart, aorta, and fat of a horse, prepared in a kettle, and is often shared between sisters-in-law as a sign of unity. is a sausage eaten in the spring when a cow has a new calf; it is a giant sausage sometimes served with rice or . is a dish made from sheep's brain, made by putting the brain in a wooden bowl, adding marrow, pieces of meat, salted fat in broth, and garlic, and this dish is then often served to honored guests. is a large camel bone distributed to children after slaughtering and cooking meat from a camel.\n\nTraditional milk products include , which is boiled milk. is sour cream made from boiled milk, and is sometimes served with tea. is butter made from old milk, often in a leather bag. is prepared by pressing thick sour cream, and is dried until white and salty. \"Irimzhik\" is a cottage cheese processed in the spring, made from boiled, unskimmed milk and added sour cream. and are strained and thickened sour milk. is a herdsman’s food, which is thickened milk made out on the steppe. is made from the scum on the sides of a metal pot and is used as medicine. is sour milk used in winter and summer. , which is radish salad, and finally, and (fermented camel’s milk and fermented mare’s milk) are seen as good for one’s health and are imbibed often.\nThe introduction of flour to Kazakh cuisine brought about dishes such as , , , and . is made by frying dough balls, and is a flat cake made in a similar fashion. , a very popular Kazakh dish, is a spiced mixture of ground lamb (or beef) spiced with black pepper, enclosed in a dough wrapper. are cooked in a multi-level steamer and served topped with butter, sour cream, or onion sauce. is a type of traditional bread made in the tandoor oven, popular in cities along the Silk Way. , , and are flat puff cakes fried in oil then covered in cream.

These drinks were traditionally consumed with the main course. However, meals often end with and then tea. In the summer, is one of the staple drinks of the Adai Kazakhs. Black tea was introduced from China after the foundation of the Silk Way and was traditionally consumed with sweets after the main course. Nowadays it has virtually replaced other traditional drinks and every meal is accompanied with tea. The tea ceremony, taking its roots from the nomads many centuries ago, is a special dastarkhan ritual in Kazakhstan. Kazakh tea represents strong black tea with milk or cream. Consumption of tea in Kazakhstan is one of the highest in the world - 1,2 kilograms a year per person. In comparison, tea consumption in India is 650 grams per person.\n\nThe most common traditional sweets are , , (also known by the Tatar name ), and .\nThey are easy to prepare in nomadic conditions - in a cauldron, and today are traditionally prepared for any celebration undoubtedly being an additional decoration of the festive table.\n\nIn addition to traditional nomadic practices and the internal development of Kazakh food and cuisine, other countries and ethnic groups have had a large influence on the food and food culture of Kazakhstan. These ethnic groups included Russians, Tatars, Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Germans, Uyghurs, Koreans, and many more. Although traditional Kazakh cuisine is based on meat and milk products, more recently, vegetables, fish and seafood, baked dishes, and sweets have been added to Kazakh cuisine.\n\nIn nomadic cookery, the amount of equipment is minimal because it must be transported from location to location to follow the grazing herds. In addition, there are no luxuries such as electricity or running water. The iron kazan is the most indispensable piece of cookware—it is used for cooking pilaf, soups, and even bread—if the kazan is shallow, it can be turned over to cook flatbread on the back. Many parts of the sheep and goat are used for holding milk products or for making cheese.\n\nThe host of the meal cuts the meat himself (or herself) and gives the best cuts to more honored people or to children. This meat is most often eaten with thin boiled pieces of pastry. Sometimes the most honored guest at a meal will receive a cooked head of a ram, which is passed around in ceremonial or ritual practice. A guest is always given the place of honor and a special welcome in Kazakh practice.\n\nKazakhs traditionally eat at a low table called a Dastarkhān. Kazakhs also maintain a tradition of using beautiful dishware when possible. is served in wide bowls decorated with silver or in painted cups, and meat is often served on wide platters. Tea is steeped in ornate teapots and served in lovely cups. Unusual ingredients such as dried melon and small intestines were regularly woven into interesting patterns, and the breads boasted floral designs painted with berry juice. Bigger and deeper bowls are used to serve dairy products, and small wooden basins are used for making dough. Further more, each family has their own wooden spoons, which are cared for and transported in felt and wooden cases, showing their importance in food culture in Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakhs like other Central Asian nations have some special rules of \"tea ceremony\". Traditionally it is not allowed to pour tea to the brim of the cup called . The less tea is poured the more respect is given to the guest. It is explained by saying that if the host pours too much tea, it looks like he wants the guest to leave sooner. The less tea is poured, the more the host has to pour it over and over again, so that the guest always has hot tea, which shows care for the guest. However, different regions may have different understandings of the amount of \"tea with respect\".\n\n\n"}

The sport of archery declined gradually until the reign of Mahmud II who made great efforts to revive it. He also ordered his archery student, Mustafa Kani, to write a book about the history, construction, and use of these bows, from which comes most of what is now known of Turkish bowyery.\nIn 1794, in a field outside London, the Turkish ambassador’s secretary used a Turkish bow and arrow to shoot 415 yards, partially against the wind, and 482 yards with the wind. He said on a plain near Constantinople pillars were located that commemorate distances of 800 yards achieved with Turkish bows and arrows in ancient times.\nAfter the death of Mahmud II in 1839, archery resumed its decline. The living art of Turkish bowyery was lost in the 1930s with the death of the last bowyer and famous calligrapher, Neçmeddin Okyay; it has since been revived.\n\nFor many years the excellence of Turkish bows could be seen from historical records. In 1910 an archery contest was held on the beach at Le Touquet, France, where Ingo Simon was able to shoot an arrow 434 m using an old Turkish composite bow requiring a force of 440N or 99 lb.\n\nThe Turkish bow is a recurved composite bow used in the Ottoman Empire. The construction is similar to that of other classic Asiatic composite bows, with a wooden core (maple was most desirable), animal horn on the belly (the side facing the archer), and sinew on the front, with the layers secured together with Animal glue. However, several features of the Turkish bow are distinct. The curvature tends to be more extreme when the bow is unstrung, with the limbs curling forward into the shape of the letter \"C\". With some bows, the rigid tips of the limbs (\"kasan\") even touch. The grip area is not recessed like other Asianic bows and is fairly flat on the belly, while the front of the grip bulges outwards.\n\nThe dramatic curvature of the bows makes stringing them very different from straighter bows found in Europe. There is an old saying in Turkey that there are \"120 ways to string a bow,\" though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip. Heavier bows usually require the use of a long, looped strap called a \"kemend\" to pull the limbs back and hold them while the string is seated.\n\n\"Zihgir\" is the Turkish word for the thumb ring used to draw the bow in the Ottoman Empire. Turkish thumb rings were made of wood, metal, ivory, bone, horn or leather. These rings signified that the person wearing them was a warrior. In time they became a symbol of prestige in Ottoman society, and some later examples have so much ornamentation on the surface from which the bowstring slides that they could not be used to shoot with. Surviving examples are often made of precious metals and richly decorated. Some are carved from precious stones.\n\nThe \"siper\" and \"majra\" are devices used to draw arrows past the bow's front limb where the arrow would normally rest. The siper is a type of shelf strapped to the archer's bow hand, which allows the archer to use arrows several inches shorter(and therefore lighter) in order to get the maximum amount of force behind the arrow. They are most commonly used for Flight Archery, to achieve the greatest distance. The Majra is a thin piece of wood with a channel cut in it and small loop for the archer's draw hand. The device allows the archer to pull back arrows that are much shorter than were intended for the bow. There is some debate among historians if this device was designed to shoot arrows that were too short for the enemy to pick up and shoot back, or if it was a way to reuse bolts fired by Chinese crossbowmen. In modern times they are primarily used in Flight Archery to shoot shorter arrows to cut down on weight.\n\nLike many other Eastern archery styles, Turkish archery uses a \"thumb draw,\" employing a type of grip called \"mandal.\" This grip prevents the arrow from moving if the archer is on a horse and/or firing at an unusual angle. The draw itself is relatively short, usually under the chin or by the cheek, compared to archery styles in China or Japan where the nock is pulled past the head. When the arrow is released, the draw arm is kept relatively steady rather than allowing the arm to swing backwards.\n\nTurkish archers developed several unique techniques to aid in combat. One was the practice of holding several arrows in between the fingers of the draw hand, allowing fast repeat shots. Another was \"Jarmakee\" which involves drawing the bow with the draw arm going behind the head so as the fire at a steep downward angle. This was used to fire from atop walls down at enemy troops.\n\n\n"}

It is part of a variety of culinary traditions, including soul food and Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, and is served in certain specialty restaurants in the United States.\n\nThe most common chicken and waffle pairing comes from the American soul food tradition and uses fried chicken. The waffle is served as it would be for breakfast, with condiments such as butter and syrup. This combination of foods is beloved by many people who are influenced by traditions of soul food passed down from past generations of their families. This version of the dish is popular in Baltimore, Maryland, enough to become a local custom.\n\nThe traditional Pennsylvania Dutch version consists of a plain waffle with pulled, stewed chicken on top, covered in gravy. It is generally found in the Northeastern United States.\n\nThe exact origins of this dish are unknown, although several theories about its origin exist. Waffles entered American cuisine in the 1600s with European colonists. The food's popularity saw a notable boost after 1789 with Thomas Jefferson's purchase of a waffle iron in France.\n\nIn the early 1800s, hotels and resorts outside Philadelphia served waffles with fried catfish. Such establishments also served other dishes like fried chicken, which gradually became the meat of choice due to catfish's limited, seasonal availability. Waffles served with chicken and gravy were noted as a common Sunday dish among the Pennsylvania Dutch by the 1860s. A 1901 memoir recalled a tavern in East Liberty, Pennsylvania, well known for \"suppers of spring chickens and waffles.\" By the end of the 19th century, the dish was a symbol of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, brought on in part by its association with tourism.\n\nIn 1909, a Griswold's waffle iron advertisement promised, \"You can attend a chicken and waffle supper right at home any time you have the notion if you are the owner of a Griswold's American Waffle Iron.\"\n\nThe traditional origin of the dish states that because African Americans in the South rarely had the opportunity to eat chicken and were more familiar with flapjacks or pancakes than with waffles, they considered the dish a delicacy. For decades, it remained \"a special-occasion meal in African American families.\" Other historians, however, cite a scarcity of early evidence of the dish's existence in the South; they place the origin later, after the post-Civil War migration of Southern African-Americans to the North during the Reconstruction Era. The combination of chicken and waffles does not appear in early Southern cookbooks such as \"Mrs. Porter’s Southern Cookery Book\", published in 1871, or in \"What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking\", published in 1881 by former slave Abby Fisher. Fisher's cookbook is generally considered the first cookbook written by an African American. The lack of a recipe for the combination of chicken and waffles in Southern cookbooks from the era may suggest a later origin for the dish. Popular culture may have associated the dish with the South by 1917, when Edna Ferber's \"Fanny Herself\" mentioned a Chicago restaurant falsely advertising \"Southern chicken dinner with waffles and real maple syrup, 35 cents each.\"\n\nFried chicken and waffles came to Los Angeles by 1931, when they were served at The Maryland, a restaurant that marketed the dish as a Southern specialty.

Cain's 1941 novel \"Mildred Pierce\" concerns a woman who finds success serving \"chicken-and-waffle dinner\" at her Glendale restaurant.\n\nIn New York, the dish was served in the African-American community in Harlem as early as the 1930s in such locations as Tillie's Chicken Shack, Dickie Wells' jazz nightclub, and particularly the Wells Supper Club. In 1935 Bunny Berigan composed a jazz instrumental titled \"Chicken and Waffles\".\n\nSince the 1970s, chicken and waffles have regained popularity in Los Angeles due to the fame of former Harlem resident Herb Hudson's restaurant Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles, which has become known as a favorite of some Hollywood celebrities and been referenced in several movies.\n\n<br>\n"}

Traditional forms are \"aku\" (an oily tuna) and \"heʻe\" (octopus). Heʻe (octopus) poke is usually called by its Japanese name Tako Poke, except in places like the island of Niʻihau where the Hawaiian language is spoken. Increasingly popular ahi poke is generally made with yellowfin tuna. Adaptations may feature raw salmon or various shellfish as a main ingredient served raw with the common poke seasonings.\n\nThe traditional Hawaiian poke consists of fish that has been gutted, skinned, and deboned. It is served with traditional condiments such as sea salt, candlenut, seaweed, and limu.\n\nAccording to the food historian Rachel Laudan, the present form of poke became popular around the 1970s. It used skinned, deboned, and filleted raw fish served with Hawaiian salt, seaweed, and roasted, ground kukui nut meat. This form of poke is still common in the Hawaiian islands.\n\nBeginning around 2012, poke became increasingly popular in the mainland United States. A number of poke restaurants—mostly but not exclusively fast casual restaurants—became popular.\n\nPoke began with fishermen seasoning the cut-offs from their catch to serve as a snack. Traditional poke seasonings have been heavily influenced by Japanese and other Asian cuisines. These include soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil. Others include furikake (mix of dried fish, sesame seeds, and dried seaweed), chopped dried or fresh chili pepper, limu (seaweed), sea salt, inamona (roasted crushed candlenut), fish eggs, wasabi, and Maui onions. Other variations of poke may include cured \"hee\" (octopus), other types of raw tuna, raw salmon and various kinds of shellfish.\n\nTraditional Hawaiian poke may consist of cubed raw fish, maui onions, Inamona (a condiment made of roasted, salted candlenut), Limu (algae), soy sauce, green onions, or sesame oil. \n\nPoke comes from the same culinary and linguistic origins as other Polynesian fish salads such as oka in Samoa, ika mata in the Cook Islands, and kokoda in Fiji .\n\nRaw fish dishes similar to poke that are often served in Europe are fish carpaccio and fish tartare. Also similar to poke are Korean hoedeopbap, marinated raw tuna served over rice, and Peruvian ceviche. Japanese sashimi also consists of raw seafood; other similar Japanese dishes are zuke don, a donburi dish topped with cured fish (usually tuna or salmon) along with avocado topped with furikake, and kaisendon, a more elaborate version served with additional non-fish toppings.\n\n"}

While dish varies from region to region it is most commonly made using cannellini beans, Great Northern beans or borlotti beans and a small variety of pasta such as elbow macaroni or ditalini. The base typically includes olive oil, garlic, minced onion, celery, carrots and often stewed tomatoes or tomato paste. Some variations omit tomatoes and instead use a broth base. Preparation may be vegetarian, or contain meat (often bacon or pancetta) or a meat-based stock.\n\nThe recipe varies greatly based on the region or town in which it is prepared, depending on available ingredients. The consistency of the dish can vary, with some being soupy, while others are much thicker. For instance, in Bari the dish is thicker in consistency and uses mixed pasta shapes. It also uses pancetta in the base of the sauce. Other varieties call for the beans to be passed through a food mill, giving it a stew-like consistency.\n\nThe word for \"beans\" varies in different Italian languages, e.g. in standard Italian, in Neapolitan, and in Sicilian. \"Pastafazoola\", a 1927 novelty song by Van and Schenck, capitalizes on the Neapolitan pronunciation in the rhyme, \"Don't be a fool, eat pasta fazool\"; and the song \"That's Amore\", by Warren and Brooks (popularized by Dean Martin), includes the rhyme \"When the stars make you drool, just like pasta fazool, that's amore\". A potential contestant of U.S. Masterchef Season 1 served pasta e fagioli to judges Gordon Ramsay, Joe Bastianich, and Graham Elliot. He did not pass, with Ramsay calling the dish \"dreadful\".\n\n"}

It has been making leather goods since 1866, when it was founded in Hockley, Birmingham. In the 1880s, the production of bicycle saddles began, the first saddle patent having been filed in 1882. In a 2014 interview with Feel Desain, a Brooks spokesperson stated that according to family legend, the company began when founder John Boultbee Brooks, a horse saddle manufacturer, tried to use a bicycle after his horse died but found the wooden seat very uncomfortable. As a result, he vowed to set about solving this problem and Brooks was born.\n\nRaleigh Bicycle Company bought Brooks in 1962. When Raleigh collapsed in 1999, Brooks was sold and subsequently went into liquidation. John Godfrey Macnaughtan and Adrien Williams were able to buy the company and keep production in England. In 2002, they sold Brooks to Selle Royal of Italy.\nThe fundamental design of a Brooks saddle is a leather top stretched between a metal \"cantle plate\" at the rear and a nose piece, to which it is attached with steel or copper rivets. Using a threaded bolt, the nose piece can be moved forward independently of the rails, tensioning the leather. It is important not to over-tension the leather or it may tear, especially at the rivets. Normally the nose bolt should not be adjusted unless the saddle becomes noticeably sagged, in which case it should only be adjusted in fractions of a turn until the top is comfortable again.\n\nAfter a certain period of use, which can be from 100 miles to 1,000 miles depending on the leather used to make the top, the saddle visibly moulds itself to the rider and \"dimples\" appear where the \"sit bones\" normally rest. This is caused by fibres in the leather breaking down under the weight of the rider. The saddle is normally more comfortable by this stage, although some riders find that no break-in period is necessary for comfort and other riders never find a Brooks saddle comfortable, even after many thousands of miles.\n\nLeather saddles are not waterproof (although this does mean they are able to absorb and dissipate sweat by \"breathing\"). Brooks produce a dressing, Proofide, which should be applied occasionally. The composition of Proofide is mainly tallow, the current blend also includes some citronella oil, identifiable by its sharp odour.\n\nLeather saddles are two or three times heavier than modern plastic or carbon-fibre designs (although the titanium versions of the Team Pro, Swift and Swallow race saddles are an exception to this heaviness) but, for some riders, the traditional appearance and long-distance comfort make this a worthwhile trade-off.\n\nThe saddle companies Lycett and The Leatheries were taken over by Brooks. Also, Brooks were amalgamated with Wrights Saddle Co. who they eventually absorbed.\n\n"}

{"id": "4287100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4287100", "title": "Silsila", "text": "Silsila\n\nSilsila () is an Arabic word meaning \"chain\", \"link\", \"connection\" often used in various senses of lineage. In particular, it may be translated as \"(religious) order\" or \"spiritual genealogy\" where one Sufi Master transfers his khilfat to his spiritual descendant.\n\nEvery tariqa has a silsila. Silsilas originated with the initiation of Sufi orders which dates back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Most silsilas trace their lineage back to his cousin and son-in-law Ali bin Abi Talib such as the Qadiriyyah, the Chishtiyya, the Noorbakhshia and the Suhrawardiyyah orders. However, other silsilas owe their ancestry to other caliphs such as the Naqshbandiyyah order of South Asia is through the Caliph Abu Bakr.\n\nCenturies ago, Arabia did not have schools for formal education. Students went to masters who taught them. Upon completion of their study, they received ijazah (permission) which acted as the certification of their education. A graduate then acted as a master having his own students or disciples. This chain of masters was known as Silsila or lineage. Somewhat analogous to the modern situation where degrees are only accepted from recognized universities, the certification of a master having a verifiable chain of masters was the only criteria which accorded legitimacy:\n\n\"Theoretically one can only receive instruction in these practices (talqîn) from an authorised teacher of the tariqa, and only after pledging a vow of obedience (bay'ah) to this shaikh. The shaikh gives his disciples permission (ijâza) to practice the tariqa: he may also authorise one or more of them to teach it to others, i.e. appoint them as his khalîfa. In this way a hierarchically ordered network of teachers may emerge. Each shaikh can show a chain of authorities for the tarekat he teaches, his silsila or spiritual genealogy. Usually the silsila reaches back from one's own teacher up to the Prophet, with whom all tarekats claim to have originated although there have been modifications along the way. A Sufi's silsila is his badge of identity and source of legitimation; it provides him with a list of illustrious predecessors and shows how he is related to other Sufis.\"\n\nSilsila can be of a partial knowledge or a book as well. All Hafiz (memorizers of Quran), Muhaddiths (narrators of Hadiths), Qaries (reciters of Quran with correct accent and pronunciation) are given a chain of credible narrators linking to the Islamic prophet Mohammad.\n\nFor Muslims, the Chain of Authenticity is an important way to ascertain the validity of a saying of Mohammad (also known as a Hadith). The Chain of Authenticity relates the chain of people who have heard and repeated the saying of Mohammad through the generations, until that particular Hadith was written down (Ali bin Abi Talib said that 'Aisha said that the Prophet Mohammad said…). A similar idea appears in Sufism in regards to the lineage and teachings of Sufi masters and students. This string of master to student is called a silsila, literally meaning “chain”. The focus of the silsila like the Chain of Authenticity is to trace the lineage of a Sufi order to Mohammad through his Companions: Ali bin Abi Talib (the primary link between Sufi orders and Mohammad), Abu Bakr, and Umar (three of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs). When a Sufi order can be traced back to Mohammad through one of the three aforementioned Companions the lineage is called the Silsilat al-Dhahab (dhahab meaning gold) or the “Chain of Gold” (Golden Chain). In early Islamic history, gold was an extremely desired prize and was used for currency, to show wealth and power, and for scientific purposes including medicine. Thus, gold was the most desired commodity in the material world, just as the Golden Chain is the most desired commodity of Sufi orders.\n\nWhen Sufism began in the second century of Islam, according to some experts, it was an individual choice; many Sufis aimed to be more like Muhammad by becoming ascetic and focusing their lives fully on God; more so than the Five Daily Prayers and usual prescripted religious practices. This often included removing oneself from society and other people in general. As Sufism became a greater movement in Islam, individual Sufis began to group together. These groups (also known as orders) were based on a common master. This common master then began spiritual lineage, which is a connection between a Sufi order in which there is a common spiritual heritage based on the master’s teachings (i.e., ‘path’ or ‘method’) called tariq or tariqah. As the number of Sufi orders grew, there arose a need for legitimacy of the orders to establish each order was following the teachings of Mohammad directly; thus the idea of the Silsilat al-Dhahab. If a Sufi order is able to trace its student to master lineage back to one of the three major caliphs (and in particular Ali bin Abi Talib) who provide a straight link to Mohammad (because of their Companion status with him) then the order is considered righteous and directly following the teachings of Mohammad. In possessing the Golden Chain, a Sufi order is able to establish their order prominently in the mystical world.\n\nShias use it idiomatically to mean a lineage of authentic Masters.\n\nAmong Chinese Muslims, the concept of \"silsilah\" has developed into that of a \"menhuan\" (门宦): a Chinese-style Sufi order whose leaders trace a lineage chain going back to the order's founder in China (e.g., Ma Laichi or Ma Mingxin), and beyond, toward his teachers in Arabia.\n\nThe term is used as the title of royal family trees and family records of the rulers in the palaces of Java.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4297226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4297226", "title": "Twisted K-theory", "text": "Twisted K-theory\n\nIn mathematics, twisted K-theory (also called K-theory with local coefficients) is a variation on K-theory, a mathematical theory from the 1950s that spans algebraic topology, abstract algebra and operator theory.\n\nMore specifically, twisted K-theory with twist \"H\" is a particular variant of K-theory, in which the twist is given by an integral 3-dimensional cohomology class. It is special among the various twists that K-theory admits for two reasons. First, it admits a geometric formulation. This was provided in two steps; the first one was done in 1970 (Publ. Math. de l'IHÉS) by Peter Donovan and Max Karoubi; the second one in 1988 by Jonathan Rosenberg in Continuous-Trace Algebras from the Bundle Theoretic Point of View.\n\nIn physics, it has been conjectured to classify D-branes, Ramond-Ramond field strengths and in some cases even spinors in type II string theory. For more information on twisted K-theory in string theory, see K-theory (physics).\n\nIn the broader context of K-theory, in each subject it has numerous isomorphic formulations and, in many cases, isomorphisms relating definitions in various subjects have been proven. It also has numerous deformations, for example, in abstract algebra K-theory may be twisted by any integral cohomology class.\n\nTo motivate Rosenberg's geometric formulation of twisted K-theory, start from the Atiyah-Jänich theorem, stating that\n\nthe Fredholm operators on Hilbert space formula_2, is a classifying space for ordinary, untwisted K-theory. This means that the K-theory of the space formula_3 consists of the homotopy classes of maps\n\nfrom formula_3 to formula_6\n\nA slightly more complicated way of saying the same thing is as follows. Consider the trivial bundle of formula_7 over formula_3, that is, the Cartesian product of formula_3 and formula_7. Then the K-theory of formula_3 consists of the homotopy classes of sections of this bundle.\n\nWe can make this yet more complicated by introducing a trivial\n\nbundle formula_13 over formula_3, where formula_12 is the group of projective unitary operators on the Hilbert space formula_2. Then the group of maps\n\nfrom formula_13 to formula_7 which are equivariant under an action of formula_12 is equivalent to the original groups of maps\n\nThis more complicated construction of ordinary K-theory is naturally generalized to the twisted case. To see this, note that formula_12 bundles on formula_3 are classified by elements formula_24 of the third integral cohomology group of formula_3. This is a consequence of the fact that formula_12 topologically is a representative Eilenberg-MacLane space\n\nThe generalization is then straightforward. Rosenberg has defined\n\nthe twisted K-theory of formula_3 with twist given by the 3-class formula_24, to be the space of homotopy classes of sections of the trivial formula_7 bundle over formula_3 that are covariant with respect to a formula_12 bundle formula_34 fibered over formula_3 with 3-class formula_24, that is\n\nEquivalently, it is the space of homotopy classes of sections of the formula_7 bundles associated to a formula_12 bundle with class formula_24.\n\nWhen formula_24 is the trivial class, twisted K-theory is just untwisted K-theory, which is a ring. However, when formula_24 is nontrivial this theory is no longer a ring. It has an addition, but it is no longer closed under multiplication.\n\nHowever, the direct sum of the twisted K-theories of formula_3 with all possible twists is a ring. In particular, the product of an element of K-theory with twist formula_24 with an element of K-theory with twist formula_45 is an element of K-theory twisted by formula_46. This element can be constructed directly from the above definition by using adjoints of Fredholm operators and construct a specific 2 x 2 matrix out of them (see the reference 1, where a more natural and general Z/2-graded version is also presented). In particular twisted K-theory is a module over classical K-theory.\n\nPhysicist typically want to calculate twisted K-theory using the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence. The idea is that one begins with all of the even or all of the odd integral cohomology, depending on whether one wishes to calculate the twisted formula_47 or the twisted formula_48, and then one takes the cohomology with respect to a series of differential operators. The first operator, formula_49, for example, is the sum of the three-class formula_24, which in string theory corresponds to the Neveu-Schwarz 3-form, and the third Steenrod square. No elementary form for the next operator, formula_51, has been found, although several conjectured forms exist. Higher operators do not contribute to the formula_52-theory of a 10-manifold, which is the dimension of interest in critical superstring theory. Over the rationals Michael Atiyah and Graeme Segal have shown that all of the differentials reduce to Massey products of formula_3.\n\nAfter taking the cohomology with respect to the full series of differentials one obtains twisted formula_52-theory as a set, but to obtain the full group structure one in general needs to solve an extension problem.\n\nThe three-sphere, formula_55, has trivial cohomology except for formula_56 and formula_57 which are both isomorphic to the integers. Thus the even and odd cohomologies are both isomorphic to the integers. Because the three-sphere is of dimension three, which is less than five, the third Steenrod square is trivial on its cohomology and so the first nontrivial differential is just formula_58. The later differentials increase the degree of a cohomology class by more than three and so are again trivial; thus the twisted formula_52-theory is just the cohomology of the operator formula_49 which acts on a class by cupping it with the 3-class formula_24.\n\nImagine that formula_24 is the trivial class, zero. Then formula_49 is also trivial. Thus its entire domain is its kernel, and nothing is in its image. Thus formula_64 is the kernel of formula_49 in the even cohomology, which is the full even cohomology, which consists of the integers. Similarly formula_66 consists of the odd cohomology quotiented by the image of formula_49, in other words quotiented by the trivial group. This leaves the original odd cohomology, which is again the integers. In conclusion, formula_48 and formula_69 of the three-sphere with trivial twist are both isomorphic to the integers. As expected, this agrees with the untwisted formula_52-theory.\n\nNow consider the case in which formula_24 is nontrivial. formula_24 is defined to be an element of the third integral cohomology, which is isomorphic to the integers. Thus formula_24 corresponds to a number, which we will call formula_74. formula_49 now takes an element formula_76 of formula_77 and yields the element formula_78 of formula_79. As formula_74 is not equal to zero by assumption, the only element of the kernel of formula_49 is the zero element, and so formula_82. The image of formula_49 consists of all elements of the integers that are multiples of formula_74. Therefore, the odd cohomology, formula_85, quotiented by the image of formula_49, formula_87, is the cyclic group of order formula_74, formula_89. In conclusion\n\nIn string theory this result reproduces the classification of D-branes on the 3-sphere with formula_74 units of formula_24-flux, which corresponds to the set of symmetric boundary conditions in the supersymmetric formula_93 WZW model at level formula_94.\n\nThere is an extension of this calculation to the group manifold of SU(3). In this case the Steenrod square term in formula_49, the operator formula_51, and the extension problem are nontrivial.\n\n\n\n"}

When a Homeric hero is under emotional stress, he may externalize his \"thumos\" and converse with or scold it.\n\nPlato's \"Phaedrus\" and his later work \"The Republic\" discuss \"thumos\" as one of the three constituent parts of the human psyche. In the \"Phaedrus\", Plato depicts \"logos\" as a charioteer driving the two horses \"eros\" and \"thumos\" (erotic love and spiritedness are to be guided by logos). In the \"Republic\" (Book IV) soul becomes divided into (See Plato's tripartite theory of soul):.\n\nHowever, the term \"emotion\" is relatively modern. It was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections.\n\nDemocritus used \"euthymia\" (i.e. \"good thumos\") to refer to a condition in which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, superstition, or other passions.

He relates Socrates' ideas about \"Thymos\" and desire to how people want to be recognized within their government. Problems emerge when other people do not recognize another's \"Thymos\", and therefore do not provide the justice that it requires. In order for people to exist in harmony, Fukuyama argues, \"isothymia\" rather than \"megalothymia\" must be used to satisfy the human need for recognition.

They are hard, tablet-shaped sweets in a variety of fruit flavours featuring a short, love-related message on one side of the sweet. They are an updated version of Victorian-era Conversation Lozenges.\nThe sweets are suitable for either chewing or sucking. On chewing the sweet quickly disintegrates into a powdery, starchy consistency.\n\nLove Hearts currently come in six flavours, each associated with a colour (listed from weakest to strongest flavour):\n\n\nThe sweets are small and circular, approximately in diameter, and in height (including the embossed decorations). Both sides are embossed with a decoration, the rear with a large outline of a heart and the front with the message within an outline of a heart. On the front of the sweet the embossing is highlighted with a red colouring.\n\nThe main body of the sweet is coloured in one of the 6 colours: white, yellow, orange, green, purple or red. Especially for the darker red and purple colourings this colouring is somewhat blotchy.\n\nThere are many different messages which can be found on the front of the sweet, most of which are love-related. The message is written in capitals in a sans serif font of varying size. The font is scaled and sometimes stretched out of proportion to fit the available space.\n\nThere are many messages (it is uncommon to find more than 3 repeats in a packet of 20). These include:\n\nThe messages have been updated many times, for example:\n\nMost messages are written in simple horizontal, centrally aligned, lines. There are some exceptions to this rule, including the phrase \"I Surrender\", where the word surrender has been written in an arc around the lower inside edge of the heart outline.\nThe \"Just Say No\" message has an unclear layout, appearing to read \"Justsay No\".\n\nWayne and Coleen Rooney had personalised sweets made for their wedding in the summer of 2008 which read \"Wayne and Coleen\".

The packaging is a clear plastic wrap (twisted at both ends) wrapped in a paper label. Alternative package sizes are available under special circumstances, such as the 2006 \"silver love heart\" competition, where the packet size was temporarily increased. Different sizes have also been released, including giant and small Love Hearts.\n\nThe label depicts the phrase \"Love Hearts\" bordered by two rows of stylised love hearts.

The carcass measured 55 ft (16.8 m) in length, but as part of the tail was apparently missing, it was estimated the animal was longer than that. The Natural History Society (Wernerian Society) of Edinburgh could not identify the carcass and decided it was a new species, probably a sea serpent. The Scottish anatomist John Barclay gave it the scientific name \"Halsydrus pontoppidani\" (Pontoppidan's sea-snake) in honor of Erik Pontoppidan, who described sea serpents in a work published half a century before. Later, the anatomist Sir Everard Home in London dismissed the measurement, declaring it must have been around 36 ft (11 m), and deemed it to be a decayed basking shark (basking sharks can take on a 'pseudo plesiosaur' appearance during decomposition). In 1849, Scottish professor John Goodsir in Edinburgh came to the same conclusion.\n\nThe Stronsay Beast (known locally as the Stronsay monster) was measured by three witnesses (one was a carpenter and the other two were farmers). It was 4 ft (1.2 m) wide and had a circumference of about 10 ft (3.1 m). It had three pairs of 'paws' or 'wings'. Its skin was smooth when stroked head to tail and rough when stroked tail to head. Its fins were edged with bristles and it had a 'mane' of bristles all down its back. The bristles glowed in the dark when wet. Its stomach contents were red.\n\nBernard Heuvelmans, a founding figure of cryptozoology, suggested that it may indeed have been an unusually large basking shark. The drawings of the Stronsay beast's decayed carcass are similar in shape and size to the popular image of the Loch Ness Monster, although it was criticized by the eyewitnesses as not matching their description in all regards (Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society, Vol L 1808–10). The third pair of appendages could be a male shark's \"claspers\", but male sharks are generally smaller than the females of the same species. The creature's remains were cartilage, not bone, so it could not have been an oarfish nor any other animal with a bone skeleton (Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History Society, Vol L 1808–10).\n\n\n"}

It is used as a vegetable. It is popular in Middle East, East African and North African countries. \"Mulukhiyah\" is rather bitter, and when boiled, the resulting liquid is a thick, highly mucilaginous broth; it is often described as \"slimy\", rather like cooked okra. \"Mulukhiyah\" is generally eaten cooked, not raw, and is most frequently turned into a kind of soup or stew, typically bearing the same name as the vegetable in the local language. Traditionally mulukhiyah is cooked with chicken or at least chicken stock for flavor and is served with white rice, accompanied with lemon or lime.\n\nWhile most scholars are of the opinion that mulukhiya's origins lie in Ancient Egypt, there is evidence that India is the source of the related species \"Corchorus capsularis\", which is also used for food as well as fiber.\n\nAs used in Egyptian cuisine, \", () is prepared by removing the central spine from the leaves, and then chopping the leaves finely with garlic and coriander. The dish generally includes some sort of meat; in Egypt this is usually poultry such as chicken, or rabbit, but lamb is preferred when available, particularly in Cairo. Cooks in Alexandria often opt to use shrimp in the soup, while Port Said is famous for using fish.\n\n\" was consumed in ancient Egyptian cuisine, where the name \"\" is thought to have originated from.\n\nMany Egyptians consider to be the national dish of Egypt, along with \"ful medames\" and \"kushari\".\n\nThe Egyptian version differs in texture and preparation from the Syrian/Lebanese version. The molokhiya leaves are picked off the stem, with tall stemmed branches, and the leaves placed on a large sheet (cloth material) to be left to completely dry for later use.\n\nThe leaves are chopped fine, often with a mezzaluna. The leaves are then boiled in broth with large chunks of meat, such as boneless chicken, rabbit, beef or lamb (with bone). Coriander and garlic are fried separately in ghee to make the \"takleya\", and then added to the soup at the end while the takleya is still sizzling, to create a characteristic sound which people traditionally respond to with the \"shahka\" (Arabic: grasp for breath in fear or surprise).\n\nThe soup is served on white rice or with a side of Egyptian flatbread (\"ʿeish baladi\"). The dish is often accompanied with an assortment of pickled vegetables, known as \"torshi\" or \"mekhalel\" in Egypt.\n\nThe standard molokhia dish in the Levant is prepared by cooking a meat of some sort in a separate pot by boiling. Later onions and garlic are cooked to a simmer, then water and chicken stock cubes are added to form a broth. After boiling, the cooked chicken or meat and molokhia leaves are added and further cooked another 15 minutes. Also, in northern Lebanon, a dish called \"mloukhiye b zeit\" is made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked in olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers; it is a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts.\n\nBedouins have an old tradition of cooking a different version of the dish. A whole chicken is cut open, the intestines removed, and the innards stuffed with herbs, spices and raw rice then sewn shut with thick thread. The chicken is then boiled to create the broth for the molokhia soup which, after preparation, is served as five separate components: The molokhia soup, Arabic flat bread, the chicken (stuffed with flavored rice), additional plain rice, and a small bowl with a mixture of lemon juice and sliced chilli. The soup is mixed with rice and lemon juice according to taste, while the chicken is eaten on a separate plate.\n\nIn Kenya, the dish is known as \"mutere\" (Luragoli), \"murere\" (Luhya), \"apoth\" (Luo), \"mrenda\" (Gikuyu, Embu, Meru), and several other native language names. It is a very popular vegetable dish among communities in the Western region (Vihiga, Kakamega, Busia, Trans Nzoia and Bungoma Counties) and in Nyanza region (Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Kisii, Migori and Nyamira Counties). Both regions are in the area around Lake Victoria. The jute leaves are separated from the stems, washed, and then boiled in lightly salted water with \"ligadi\" (a raw form of soda (bicarbonate of soda), or \"munyu\" (traditional plant-based salt). The leaves are boiled with other leafy vegetables such as \"likuvi\" (Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) leaves) or \"mito\" (Chipilín) to reduce their sliminess and help soften the other vegetable leaves. In some cases, after boiling for about thirty minutes, the vegetables are stewed with tomatoes and onions in oil. (There are several general ways to prepare the mutere and more ways in which it is served). Spices such as curry, pepper, masala, or coriander are optional. Mutere is served with ugali (a staple stuff, cooked cereal meal) and can be accompanied with meat or chicken.\n\nIn Tunisia, the dish is generally prepared quite differently from the Egyptian method. The leaves, already separated from the stems, are dried then ground to produce a very fine powder and stored in jars or other tightly closed containers. In Tunisian cooking, mulukhya, or mloukhiya, takes 5 to 7 hours to prepare, which is often done to halfway in the evening and completed in the morning. The powder is prepared with olive oil and some tomato paste into a sauce, not soup, and big chunks of chuck beef are often added halfway through cooking. The dark green sauce simmers on low heat and is left to thicken to the consistency of tomato sauce. The sauce is served in small deep plates with a piece of beef and eaten with preferably white hardy French or Italian bread. In certain regions where beef is not common, lamb is used but cooks for a much shorter time.\n\nIn Cyprus the dish is known as \"molohiya\". It is popular among the Turkish Cypriots. The Jute leaves are cultivated and grown in the spring months leading up to the summer, whereupon they are harvested and the leaves are separated from the stem and dried whole. They are cooked in a tomato based broth with onions and garlic. Lamb on the bone or Chicken with bone may also be added. For optimal results, lemon and potato are also used to help keep the consistency from becoming too mucilaginous or slimy. It is served with a nice broth consistency with sour dough bread.\n\nThe leaf is a common food in many tropical West African countries. It is believed that the \"drip tips\" on the leaves serve to shed excess water from the leaf from the heavy rains in the tropics. \nIn Sierra Leone it is called \"kren-kre\" (krain krain or crain crain), and is eaten in a palm oil sauce served with rice or cassava fufu (a traditional food made from cassava), or else is steamed and mixed into rice just before eating a non-palm oil sauce.\nAmong the Yorubas in south-west Nigeria, it is called \"ewedu\" and served with cooked yam flour (\"amala\"). \nIn Liberia it is called \"palaver sauce\", and is served with rice or fufu. In The Gambia it is referred to as \"kereng-kereng\" and is typically used to make \"supakanja\" (a dish mostly served on Saturdays and made with okra, red palm oil, fish and meat).\n\nIn Haiti, the leafy green dish is commonly known as \"lalo\" and is traditionally cooked with or without meat. When considering meat, Haitians utilize beef or pork shoulder. Seafood such as blue crabs, shrimp or snow crab legs are also options. It is traditionally served with white rice.\n\nThe leaves are rich in Folic acid, beta-Carotene, Iron, Calcium, Vitamin C and more than 32 vitamins, minerals and trace elements. The plant has a potent antioxidant activity with a significant α-tocopherol equivalent Vitamin E.\n\nThe word for the plant is found in ancient Mediterranean languages such as Arabic and Greek. Cognates of the word include Ancient Greek μαλάχη (\"malákhē\") or μολόχη (\"molókhē\"), Modern Greek μολόχα (\"molóha\"), modern (\"mulukhiyah\") and modern (\"malukhia\").\n\nAl-Hakim bi-Amr Allah banned mulukhiyah sometime during his reign (996–1021 CE). It is claimed he thought that the dish would lead women to debauchery. While the ban was eventually lifted after the end of his reign, the Druze, who hold Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in high regard, continue to respect the ban, and do not eat mulukhiyah of any kind to this day.\n\n\n"}

Before drying, the meat is treated with white wine and seasonings such as salt, onion and assorted herbs. The initial curing process, lasting 3 – 5 weeks, takes place in sealed containers stored at a temperature close to freezing point. The meat is regularly rearranged during this stage, in order to ensure that the salt and seasonings will be evenly distributed and absorbed. During a second drying phase the meat is then hung in free-flowing air at a temperature of between 9 and 14 °C. It is also periodically pressed in order to separate out residual moisture: from this pressing Bündnerfleisch acquires its characteristic rectangular shape. Traditionally Bündnerfleisch was not a smoked meat. \n\nThe extent of water loss during the salting and drying processes, whereby the product loses approximately half of its initial weight, is sufficient to confer excellent keeping qualities and a high nutritional value, without the need for any additional preservatives.\n\nBündnerfleisch is served with bread, sliced very thinly. It is often part of the traditional dish raclette, served to accompany the cheese of the same name alongside ham and vegetables. It can also be served in soup, cut into strips or little cubes.\n\nMost Bündnerfleisch is consumed inside Switzerland, but some is exported within Europe, to Canada and the United States and to Japan.\n\nBündnerfleisch appears to be related to the dried meat product from the Besançon region of France known as 'brési'.\nIt is also very similar to bresaola, which is produced in the neighbouring Italian province of Valtellina; unlike Bündnerfleisch, bresaola is not pressed, though.\n\nOn September 25, 2010, Switzerland's finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz, reading in parliament a nearly incomprehensible text which had been prepared by bureaucrats, started giggling uncontrollably when he reached a mention of Bündnerfleisch.\n\n\n"}

The dish exists in some cultures and is viewed as a luxury or delicacy. \n\nThe soft-shelled turtle was commonly used for turtle soup in Singapore while the snapping turtle, found mainly in the United States, was typically used there; and is still found in certain regional cuisines, particularly in Philadelphia cuisine and some Southern United States cuisines. Chinese and other East Asian cuisines use primarily soft-shelled turtles for turtle soup. An alternative form of this dish without actual turtle meat is the mock turtle soup.\n\nIn several countries such as Singapore with large Chinese populations, turtle soup is a Chinese delicacy. The meat, skin and innards of the turtle are used in the soup. Soft-shelled turtles (鱉) such as \"Pelodiscus sinensis\" are commonly consumed in this manner in Chinese cuisine, while consumption of hard-shelled turtles (龜) is often avoided due to their mythical connotations. However, the hard shells of certain turtles are used in the preparation of so-called \"turtle jelly\", or \"Guilinggao\".\n\n19th-century American cookbooks advised homemakers that for the best turtle soup one should choose a turtle about in weight, as a smaller one would not have enough fat, and a bigger one would have too strong a flavor.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, turtle soup is illegal because many species of turtle are listed as threatened or endangered, and cannot legally be captured, let alone killed. Generally speaking, turtle populations cannot quickly recover from the loss of a breeding adult; thus, killing these turtles to make soup can rapidly depress populations below sustainable levels for many years.\n\nThe common snapping turtle has also long been used in the United States, especially in the South. In this case the soup is commonly referred to as \"snapper turtle soup\", or simply \"snapper soup\" (not to be confused with \"red snapper soup\", which is made from the fish called a red snapper).\n\nIn Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley, snapper soup is available at many area diners and is an established part of Philadelphia cuisine. It is a heavy, brown soup with a flavor similar to thick meat gravy. The Philadelphia restaurant Old Original Bookbinder's served Snapper Soup which can also be purchased in cans at supermarkets.\n\nAs of 2016, turtle soup (and other dishes from turtle meat) are still served by a few restaurants in Minnesota, mostly on Fridays during Lent. It is said that it is primarily older customers who have previously eaten turtle whom order the turtle dishes; younger diners are much less interested.\n\nAmong Creole communities, Turtle soup is known as Caouane. In New Orleans, it is a specialty of several neighborhood and classic Creole restaurants such as Commander's Palace, Brennan's, and Galatoire's.\n\nTurtle soup was the 27th U.S. President William Howard Taft's favorite food. He brought a chef who specialized in the dish with him into the White House for the specific purpose of preparing this soup.\n\nEating the flesh of some marine turtles can cause a type of rare, but possibly lethal food poisoning called chelonitoxism.\n\n"}

It is named after the historic county of Glamorgan in Wales.\n\nThe earliest published mention of the dish is from the 1850s in the book \"Wild Wales\" by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.\n\nThe origins of Glamorgan sausages are unknown. Research conducted at the Glamorgan Archives in Leckwith discovered that there is at least one traditional recipe which used meat. In a notebook dated between 1795 and 1813, John Perkins, of Ty-draw, Llantrithyd, included each of lean pork and fat in his recipe for Glamorgan sausage. The spicing was also different from modern versions, calling for the use of cloves, sage and ginger.\n\nThe first published mention of them was by George Borrow in his book \"Wild Wales\", written in the 1850s and published in the next decade. He described them as \"not a whit inferior to those of Epping\"; Epping sausages were skinless meat-based sausages. Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow ate his sausages. Newspaper advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by pork butcher Henry S. Hammond of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the \"Western Mail\" on 15 December. Hammond continued to advertise over the next several years, and by 1873 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from \"choice dairy-fed pork\".\n\nGlamorgan sausages are thought to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used.\n\nIn 2005, a campaign began to register the Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This would have resulted in only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law.\n\nIn modern versions, Caerphilly cheese is used, which is a descendant of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture so that it does not fall apart during the cooking process.\n\nIn various recipes, other substitutions and additions are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as an alternative to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese as an alternative ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for the coating of the sausage.\n\nCooking techniques for the leeks vary, as some recipes call for them to be mixed in raw, while others suggest browning them first in a frying pan. If left raw, they can lend a crunchier texture to the sausage. Both the Hairy Bikers and Canteen opt for cooking the leeks first. A variety of herbs are used, with Canteen using sage as seen in the Perkins recipe, in addition to nutmeg. The Welsh Gas Board recipe simply called for \"mixed herbs\", while Felicity Cloake in \"The Guardian\" suggested the addition of thyme.

Later the redundant parts are removed, so that the remaining meat is protected by hide or the skin that surrounds the muscle tissue. After the legs are shaped, they are well salted and put at the bottom of a \"postav\", a special type of barrel designed for the occasion. The delicacy traditionally remains in salt for 40 days, then is taken out and left to dry.\n\nThere are various preservation technologies used to prepare elenski but these typically vary considerably from family to family, as opposed to regionally. In the past, the rounds were put in well trampled upon maize meal or processed with lime milk. The meat could also be stored in specially sewn bags of cheesecloth or wooden containers with thick nets instead of walls (\"muharnik\"), but as a rule were placed somewhere airy, where the clear mountain air could aid the drying and conservation, and also in order to prevent houseflies laying eggs on the rounds.\n\nIn many of the small towns around Elena, the rounds were in the past left in conservation in the rooms where the daily house fire was lit, so that a certain amount of smoking could be achieved in order to add smoked flavour.\n\n\n"}

A thin sliver of rock is cut from the sample with a diamond saw and ground optically flat. It is then mounted on a glass slide and then ground smooth using progressively finer abrasive grit until the sample is only 30 μm thick. The method involved using the Michel-Lévy interference colour chart. Typically quartz is used as the gauge to determine thickness as it is one of the most abundant minerals.\n\nWhen placed between two polarizing filters set at right angles to each other, the optical properties of the minerals in the thin section alter the colour and intensity of the light as seen by the viewer. As different minerals have different optical properties, most rock forming minerals can be easily identified. Plagioclase for example can be seen in the photo on the right as a clear mineral with multiple parallel twinning planes. The large blue-green minerals are clinopyroxene with some exsolution of orthopyroxene.\n\nThin sections are prepared in order to investigate the optical properties of the minerals in the rock. This work is a part of petrology and helps to reveal the origin and evolution of the parent rock.\n\nA photograph of a rock in thin section is often referred to as a photomicrograph.\n\nUnder thin section, in plane polarized light (PPL), quartz is colorless with low relief and no cleavage. Its habit is either fairly equant or anhedral if it infills around other minerals as a cement. Under cross polarized light (XPL) quartz displays low interference colors and is usually the defining mineral used to determine if the thin section is at standardized thickness of 30 microns as quartz will only display up to a very pale yellow interference color and no further at that thickness, and it is very common in most rocks so it will likely be available to judge the thickness.\n\nIn thin section, quartz grain provenance in a sedimentary rock can be estimated. In crossed polarized light, the quartz grain can go extinct all at once, called monocrystalline quartz, or in waves, called polycrystalline quartz. The extinction in waves is called undulose extinction and indicates dislocation walls in mineral grains. Dislocation walls are where dislocations, intracrystalline deformation via movement of a dislocation front within a plane, organize themselves into planes of sufficient quantity. They change the crystallographic orientation across the walls, so for example in quartz, the two sides of the wall will have slightly different extinction angles and thus result in undulose extinction. Since undulose extinction requires dislocation walls to have developed, and these occur more easily at higher pressures and temperatures, quartz grains with undulose extinction indicate metamorphic rock provenance for that grain. Those grains that are monocrystalline quartz are more likely to have been formed by igneous processes. Differing sources suggest the extent to which this proxy for provenance can be used. Some note the trend for immature sandstones to have less polycrystalline quartz grains compared to mature sandstones, which have grains that have passed through many sedimentary cycles. Quartz grains derived from previous sedimentary sources are determined by looking for authigenic, or grown in place, overgrowths of silica cement over the grain.\n\nThe above descriptions of quartz in thin section is usually enough to identify it. Minerals with similar appearance may include plagioclase, although it can be distinguished by the distinctive twinning in crossed polarized light and cleavage in plane polarized light, and cordierite, although it can be distinguished by twinning or inclusions in the grain. However, for certainty, other distinguishing features of quartz include the fact that it is uniaxial, it has a positive optic sign, length-slow sign of elongation, and zero degree extinction angle.\n\nFine-grained rocks, particularly those containing minerals of high birefringence, such as calcite, are sometimes prepared as ultra-thin sections. An ordinary 30 μm thin section is prepared as described above but the slice of rock is attached to the glass slide using a soluble cement such as Canada balsam (soluble in ethanol) to allow both sides to be worked on. The section is then polished on both sides using a fine diamond paste until it has a thickness in the range of 2-12 μm. This technique has been used to study the microstructure of fine-grained carbonates such as the Lochseitenkalk mylonite in which the matrix grains are less than 5 μm in size. This method is also sometimes used in the preparation of mineral and rock specimens for transmission electron microscopy and allows greater accuracy in comparing features using both optical and electron imaging.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4361880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4361880", "title": "Diauxie", "text": "Diauxie\n\nDiauxie is a Greek word coined by Jacques Monod to mean two growth phases. The word is used in English in cell biology to describe the growth phases of a microorganism in batch culture as it metabolizes a mixture of two sugars. Rather than metabolizing the two available sugars simultaneously, microbial cells commonly consume them in a sequential pattern, resulting in two separate growth phases.\n\nJacques Monod discovered diauxic growth in 1941 during his experiments with \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Bacillus subtilis\". While growing these bacteria on various combination of sugars during his doctoral thesis research, Monod observed that often two distinct growth phases are clearly visible in batch culture, as seen in Figure 1.\n\nDuring the first phase, cells preferentially metabolize the sugar on which it can grow faster (often glucose but not always). Only after the first sugar has been exhausted do the cells switch to the second. At the time of the \"diauxic shift\", there is often a lag period during which cells produce the enzymes needed to metabolize the second sugar.\n\nMonod later put aside his work on diauxic growth and focused on the \"lac\" operon model of gene expression, which led to a Nobel prize.\n\nDiauxie occurs because organisms use operons or multiple sets of genes to control differently the expression of enzymes needed to metabolize the different nutrients or sugars they encounter. If an organism allocates its energy and other resources (e.g. amino acids) to synthesize enzymes needed to metabolize a sugar that can only support a slower growth rate and not use all or most of its available resources to synthesize the enzymes that metabolize a different sugar providing a faster growth rate, such an organism will be at a reproductive disadvantage compared to those that choose to grow on the faster growth supporting sugar. Through evolution, organisms have developed the ability to regulate their genetic control mechanisms so as to only express those genes resulting in the fastest growth rate. For example, when grown in the presence of both glucose and maltose, \"Lactococcus lactis\" will produce enzymes to metabolize glucose first, altering its gene expression to use maltose only after the supply of glucose has been exhausted.\n\nIn the case of the baker's or brewer's yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" growing on glucose with plenty of aeration, the diauxic growth pattern is commonly observed in batch culture. During the first growth phase, when there is plenty of glucose and oxygen available, the yeast cells prefer glucose fermentation to aerobic respiration even though aerobic respiration is the more efficient pathway to grow on glucose. Contrary to the more commonly invoked Pasteur effect, this phenomenon of preferring the faster growth supporting fermentation is closer to the Warburg effect observed in faster growing tumors. The intracellular genetic regulatory mechanisms have evolved to enforce this choice, as fermentation provides a faster growth rate for the yeast cells than the aerobic respiration of glucose. After glucose is depleted, the fermentative product ethanol is oxidised in a noticeably slower second growth phase, if oxygen is available.\n\nIn the 1940s, Monod hypothesized that a single enzyme could adapt to metabolize different sugars. It took 15 years of further work to show that this was incorrect. During his work on the lac operon of \"E. coli\", Joshua Lederberg isolated β-galactosidase and found it in greater quantities in colonies grown on lactose compared to other sugars. Melvin Cohn in Monod's lab at the Pasteur Institute then found that β-galactosides induced enzyme activity. The idea of enzyme adaptation was thus replaced with the concept of enzyme induction, in which a molecule induces expression of a gene or operon, often by binding to a repressor protein and preventing it from attaching to the operator.\n\nIn the case of the bacterial diauxic shift from glucose to lactose metabolism, a proposed mechanism suggested that glucose initially inhibits the ability of the enzyme adenylate cyclase to synthesize cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP, in turn, is required for the catabolite activator protein (CAP) to bind to DNA and activate the transcription of the lac operon, which includes genes necessary for lactose metabolism. The presence of allolactose, a metabolic product of lactose, is sensed through the activity of the lac repressor, which inhibits transcription of the lac operon until lactose is present. Thus, if glucose is present, cAMP levels remain low, so CAP is unable to activate transcription of the lac operon, regardless of the presence or absence of lactose. Upon the exhaustion of the glucose supply, cAMP levels rise, allowing CAP to activate the genes necessary for the metabolism of other food sources, including lactose if it is present.\n\nMore recent research however suggests that the cAMP model is not correct in this instance since cAMP levels remain identical under glucose and lactose growth conditions, and a different model has been proposed and it suggests that the lactose-glucose diauxie in \"E. coli\" may be caused mainly by inducer exclusion. In this model, glucose transport via the EIIA shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell, so lactose is not transported into cell and used. While the cAMP/CAP mechanism may not play a role in the glucose/lactose diauxie, it is a suggested mechanism for other diauxie .\n"}

{"id": "4372011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4372011", "title": "Rill", "text": "Rill\n\nIn hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies.\n\nArtificial rills are channels constructed to carry a water supply from a distant water source. In landscape or garden design, constructed rills are an aesthetic water feature.\n\nRills are narrow and shallow channels which are eroded into unprotected soil by hillslope runoff. Since soil is regularly left bare during agricultural operations, rills may form on farmland during these vulnerable periods. Rills may also form when bare soil is left exposed following deforestation, or during construction activities. \n\nRills are fairly easily visible when first incised, so they are often the first indication of an ongoing erosion problem. Unless soil conservation measures are put into place, rills on regularly eroding areas may eventually develop into larger erosional features such as gullies or even (in semi-arid regions) into badlands.\n\nRills are created when water erodes the topsoil on hillsides, and so are significantly affected by seasonal weather patterns. They tend to appear more often in rainier months. Rills begin to form when the runoff shear stress, the ability of surface runoff to detach soil particles, overcomes the soil’s shear strength, the ability of soil to resist force working parallel to the soil’s surface. This begins the erosion process as water breaks soil particles free and carries them down the slope. These forces explain why sandy, loamy soils are especially susceptible to the formation of rills, whereas dense clays tend to resist rill formation.\n\nRills cannot form on every surface, and their formation is intrinsically connected to the steepness of the hillside slope. Gravity determines the force of the water, which provides the power required to start the erosional environment necessary to create rills. Therefore, the formation of rills is primarily controlled by the slope of the hillside. Slope controls the depth of the rills, while the length of the slope and the soil’s permeability control the number of incisions in an area. Each type of soil has a threshold value, a slope angle below which water velocity cannot produce sufficient force to dislodge enough soil particles for rills to form. For instance, on many non-cohesive slopes, this threshold value hovers around an angle of 2 degrees with a shear velocity between 3 and 3.5 cm/s.\n\nAfter rills begin forming, they are subjected to variety of other erosional forces which may increase their size and output volume. Up to 37% of erosion in a rill-ridden area may derive from mass movement, or collapse, of rill sidewalls. As water flows through a rill, it will undercut into the walls, triggering collapse. Also, as water seeps into the soil of the walls, they weaken, amplifying the chance of wall collapse. The erosion created by these forces increases the size of the rill while also swelling its output volume.\n\nLess commonly, dissolution of limestone and other soluble rocks by slightly acidic rainfall and runoff also results in the formation of rill-like features on the surface of the rock.\n\nAlthough rills are small, they transport significant amounts of soil each year. Some estimates claim rill flow has a carrying capacity of nearly ten times that of non-rill, or interrill, areas. In a moderate rainfall, rill flow can carry rock fragments up to 9 cm in diameter downslope. In 1987, scientist J. Poesen conducted an experiment on the Huldenberg field in Belgium which revealed that during a moderate rainfall, rill erosion removed as much as 200 kg (in submerged weight) of rock.\n\nUnfortunately, the considerable effect rills have on landscapes often negatively impact human activity. Rills have been observed washing away archaeological sites. They are also very common in agricultural areas because sustained agriculture depletes the soil of much of its organic content, increasing the erodibility of the soil. Agricultural machines, such as tractors, compact the soil to the point where water flows over the surface rather than seeping into the soil. Tractor wheel impressions often channel water, providing a perfect environment for the generation of rills. If left alone, these rills may erode considerable amounts of arable soil.\n\nUnder proper field management rills are small and are easily repaired by contour tilling the soil. This will prevent, for a time at least, the rills from growing and eroding the landscape more rapidly with time.\n\n"}

When the bricks are fired, they become creamy-yellow in color.\n\nAlthough light-colored when first made, Cream City bricks are porous, causing them to absorb dirt and other pollutants; this tends to make structures constructed out of them dark-colored as time passes. Once Cream City bricks absorb pollutants, they are difficult to clean, a problem which restoration experts in Milwaukee have been facing since the 1970s. Initially, sandblasting was attempted; however, it not only proved to be ineffective, but damaged the bricks. Currently, chemical washes are accepted as the most effective method of cleaning Cream City bricks. The historic Trimborn Farmhouse in Greendale, Wisconsin is an example of brick that has been cleaned to reveal its original color.\n\nCream City bricks are well known for their durability; many buildings constructed with them in the 19th century still stand today. An example of the durability of Cream City brick is Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church, which was built more than 125 years ago. However, since there were numerous brickmakers in the area, brick quality varied and some of the bricks were not manufactured properly: the Big Sable Point Lighthouse was constructed of Cream City brick, but it had degraded so much in 35 years that it had to be encased in iron plating.

It comes into two size categories: \"dinner plate\" with eight wedge marks on the surface and \"ha'penny staver\", an individual sized bun.\n\nThe Colston Bun is traditionally distributed to children on Colston Day (13 November), which celebrates the granting of a Royal Charter to the Society of Merchant Venturers by Charles I in 1639. The custom originated from the Colston's School, which was established for poor children in the early 18th century. Originally, the child would receive a large \"dinner plate\" bun with eight wedge marks so that individual portions could be broken off and shared with their family, plus a \"staver\" which could be eaten immediately to \"stave off\" hunger, and a gift of 2 shillings (now 10p) from the wives of the Merchant Venturers. The gifts of buns and money are still distributed to some school children in Bristol on Colston Day by the Colston Society.\n\nColston Buns are not widely known outside of Bristol, and are generally only available for sale on occasion in independent bakers around the city. In the 21st century, the name has become controversial as Edward Colston was known to have strong ties to the slave trade despite contributing to the welfare of those in Bristol, which conflicts with modern values.\n\n\n"}

The main ingredients are plain flour, butter, yeast, caster sugar, currants and sultanas. Larger versions baked in a loaf tin are known as saffron cake.\n\nIn parts of Britain, the buns were traditionally baked on sycamore leaves and dusted with powdered sugar. \n\nThe \"revel bun\" from Cornwall is baked for special occasions, such as anniversary feasts (revels), or the dedication of a church. In the West of Cornwall large saffron buns are also known as \"tea treat buns\" and are associated with Methodist Sunday school outings or activities.\nIn Sweden and Norway no cinnamon or nutmeg is used in the bun, and raisins are used instead of currants. The buns are baked into many traditional shapes, of which the simplest is a reversed S-shape. They are traditionally eaten during Advent, and especially on Saint Lucy's Day, December 13. In addition to Sweden, they are also prepared and eaten in much the same way in Finland, above all in Swedish-speaking areas and by Swedish-speaking Finns, as well as in Norway and more rarely in Denmark.\n\nMost commercially available saffron buns and cakes today contain food dyes that enhance the natural yellow provided by saffron. The very high cost of saffron - the world's most expensive spice by weight - makes the inclusion of sufficient saffron to produce a rich colour an uneconomical option. The addition of food colouring in Cornish saffron buns was already common by the end of the First World War when the scarcity of saffron tempted bakers to find other ways to colour their products.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the flagship product of and the most successful drink offered by Parle Agro India Pvt. Ltd. in India and Parle Agro Nepal Pvt. Ltd. in Nepal. Frooti was launched in 1985 in TetraPak packages. It is also now available in PET bottles and rectangular shaped packs. Frooti is exported to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Maldives, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, Mozambique, Ghana, Malawi, Zambia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Japan, Ireland, etc. Frooti is currently endorsed by Allu Arjun and \nAlia Bhatt in India.\n\nThe drink contains mango pulp, water, sugar, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salt, and approved colouring and flavouring.\n\nFrooti was launched in a green rectangular Tetra Pak as a ready-to-serve mango drink. Although it wasn't the first mango drink, Frooti quickly acquired a large market share. The packaging played a major role behind its success, since it could be carried easily and conveniently. Frooti also provided a refreshing mango taste that translated into a huge demand for itself.\n\nThe tagline \"Mango Frooti, Fresh and Juicy\", was created by the marketing duo-team of Arun Lahori & GM Menon. In a crisp brief to the then communications agency on the brand, to: \"make mango Frooti synonymous with freshness and juiciness\". Coined in a flash by creative honcho Bharat Dhabolkar. \"Fresh and juicy got to be Frooti\". The slogan revitalized the company, helping the brand strengthen and consolidate its position as the undisputed country wide leader of packaged juice drinks. \n\nOver the years the brand has experienced a series of repositioning. From the original tagline \"Mango Frooti, Fresh and Juicy\" to \"Juice Up your Life\". Eventually, the original tagline- \"Mango Frooti, Fresh and Juicy\" was reinstalled. The present ad campaigns focus on reaffirming Frooti's leading position across India in a confident manner.\n\nHistorically, Frooti did not have a brand ambassador, but Bollywood 'king' Shah Rukh Khan currently endorses Frooti. He has shot a TV commercial for the brand with children, which had a Twitter hashtag \"#SRKLovesFrooti\". The advertisement promotes PET bottles in the ad rather than a Tetra pack which they used to normally show in all their ads till now.\n\nAlong with the brand film, the marketing plan includes outdoors, BTL, mall activation, visibility at retail outlets (POP) and a strong digital presence. The first leg of this campaign was launched on social media and as per Kurup in less than a week, its total timeline deliveries amounted to 52 million. It managed to garner over 8 million Twitter handles and a count of 80,000 tweets. Frooti's YouTube channel views increased by 2.5 million and subscribers increased by 600%.The brand has spent 40% more on its marketing this year.\n\nFrooti is offered in size variants: , and and Tetra Pak. A consumer study revealed that the consumers needed a recap bottle that didn't exist in the mango drink segment. Parle Agro considered the consumer requirement strongly and launched Frooti in a new hygienic hotfill PET bottle, making it the first mango drink to be offered in the PET bottles. Frooti is now available in various sizes of PET bottles, including 200 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, 600 ml, 1.2 l and 2 l. The 2-litre packaging is only done by ParleAgro for Frooti across India.

{"id": "4379520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4379520", "title": "Sprezzatura", "text": "Sprezzatura\n\nSprezzatura is an Italian word that first appears in Baldassare Castiglione's \"The Book of the Courtier\", where it is defined by the author as \"a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it\". It is the ability of the courtier to display \"an easy facility in accomplishing difficult actions which hides the conscious effort that went into them\". \"Sprezzatura\" has also been described \"as a form of defensive irony: the ability to disguise what one really desires, feels, thinks, and means or intends behind a mask of apparent reticence and nonchalance\".\n\nThe word has entered the English language; the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \"studied carelessness\", especially as a characteristic quality or style of art or literature.\n\nCastiglione wrote \"The Book of the Courtier\" as a portrayal of an idealized courtier—one who could successfully keep the support of his ruler. The ideal courtier was supposed to be skilled in arms and in athletic events but be equally skilled in music and dancing. However, the courtier who had sprezzatura managed to make these difficult tasks look easy – and, more to the point, not appear calculating, a not-to-be-discounted asset in a milieu commonly informed by ambition, intrigue, etc. Concerning \"sprezzatura\", Castiglione said:\n\nThus, \"sprezzatura\" was essential to becoming the ideal courtier.\n\n\"Sprezzatura\" was a vital quality for a courtier to have. Courtiers essentially had to put on a performance for their peers and those who employed \"sprezzatura\" created the impression that they completely mastered the roles they played. A courtier's \"sprezzatura\" made him seem to be fully at ease in court and like someone who was \"the total master of self, society's rules, and even physical laws, and [his \"sprezzatura\" created] the distinct impression that he [was] unable to err\".\n\nHowever, while the quality of \"sprezzatura\" did have its benefits, this quality also had its drawbacks. Since \"sprezzatura\" made difficult tasks seem effortless, those who possessed \"sprezzatura\" needed to be able to trick people convincingly. In a way, \"sprezzatura\" was \"the art of acting deviously\". This \"art\" created a \"self-fulfilling culture of suspicion\" because courtiers had to be diligent in maintaining their façades. \"The by-product of the courtier's performance is that the achievement of \"sprezzatura\" may require him to deny or disparage his nature\". Consequently, \"sprezzatura\" also had its downsides, since courtiers who excelled at \"sprezzatura\" risked losing themselves to the façade they put on for their peers.\n\nRaphael as an artist exemplified \"sprezzatura\" from the beginning of his career, starting with his first signed work \"The Marriage of the Virgin\". \"Inspired by his teacher Perugino's rendering of the same subject, Raphael's painting can be found to differ primarily from its model by its unique awareness of the importance of \"sprezzatura\".\"\n\nRaphael's painting reveals its awareness of the importance of \"sprezzatura\" through his representation of Joseph. Compared to Raphael's more youthful representation of Joseph, Perugino's version of Joseph is considerably more idealized and older. Perugino's Joseph, despite his almost cloying sweetness in contrast to earlier depictions by other artists, retains a certain hardness of profile and angularity which Raphael has avoided by softening the anatomy of facial features and breaking the rigid profile ever so slightly.\nAdditionally, \"the poses and garments of the two also reveal a subtle transformation which reflects the same deliberate alteration of attitude.\" For instance, the gracefulness of Perugino's Joseph is \"emphasized by the highlighting of drapery and body. The easy S-like movement from ear to right toe is inescapably obvious.\" On the other hand, the grace displayed by Raphael's Joseph \"is equally great but perhaps more affecting since the manner of its expression is less obvious.\"\n\nJoseph's posture demonstrates an understated grace, since his slight turn toward the viewer tends to conceal the easy flow of line which characterizes the figure overall while he introduces any number of linear rhythms in the garment subordinate to the main movement of the figure. These variations, in addition to the deliberate avoidance of any dramatic highlights, help to explain why it is that we feel the \"nonchalance\" of Raphael's Joseph in contrast to the almost hieratic frozen grace of Perugino's. In the former we can detect that quality which Castiglione had in mind when he wrote: \"Therefore we may call that art true at which does not seem to be art.\"\n\nSprezzatura is a major feature of Mannerist art and sculpture, particularly, the bella maniera school in which the artist synthesized the best attributes from various sources into a new design. Sprezzatura emphasized virtuosic effects that were displayed with apparent ease and facility. Cellini's Perseus would be an excellent example.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4383270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4383270", "title": "Jameson Irish Whiskey", "text": "Jameson Irish Whiskey\n\nJameson () is a blended Irish whiskey produced by the Irish Distillers subsidiary of Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe John Jameson and Son Irish Whiskey company was formally established in 1810 when John Jameson and his son (also John Jameson) took ownership of the Bow Street Distillery in Dublin which had originally been built by his wife's cousins the Steins in 1780. Jameson was a Scottish lawyer from Alloa in Clackmannanshire who had married Margaret Haig, a sister of the Haig brothers who owned the Haig distilleries. Margaret Haig was a first cousin of the Steins, a Scottish distilling family, also from Clackmannanshire, with significant distilling interests in Scotland and Dublin. On his marriage to Margaret Haig in 1786, John Jameson moved with his new wife to Dublin to manage the Stein's Bow Street Distillery (which had been established in 1780) for Margaret's Stein uncle. This explains the use of the year 1780 in Jameson marketing as the Bow Street Distillery was where Jameson Irish Whiskey was born. Portraits of John and Margaret Jameson by Sir Henry Raeburn are in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nOriginally one of the six main Dublin Whiskeys, Jameson is now distilled in Cork. In 2013, annual sales topped 4.7 million cases (56.4 million bottles). Jameson is by far the best selling Irish whiskey in the world, as it has been sold internationally since the early 19th century. The United States is the largest market for Jameson Whiskey, with consumption during 2013 up by 12%.\n\nWhen John Jameson, a Scottish businessman, became manager of the Stein family Bow Street Distillery in 1786, it was producing about 30,000 gallons annually. By the turn of the 19th century, it was the second largest producer in Ireland and one of the largest in the world, producing 1,000,000 gallons annually. Dublin at the time was the centre of world whiskey production. It was the second most popular spirit in the world after rum and internationally Jameson had by 1805 become the world's number one whiskey. Today, Jameson is the world's third largest single-distillery whiskey.\n\nHistorical events, for a time, set the company back. The temperance movement in Ireland had an enormous impact domestically but the two key events that affected Jameson were the Irish War of Independence and subsequent trade war with the British which denied Jameson the export markets of the Commonwealth, and shortly thereafter, the introduction of prohibition in the United States. While Scottish brands could easily slip across the Canada–US border, Jameson was excluded from its biggest market for many years.\nThe introduction of column stills by the Scottish blenders in the mid-19th-century enabled increased production that the Irish, still making labour-intensive single pot still whiskey, could not compete with. There was a legal enquiry somewhere in 1908 to deal with the trade definition of whiskey. The Scottish producers won within some jurisdictions, and blends became recognised in the law of that jurisdiction as whiskey. The Irish in general, and Jameson in particular, continued with the traditional pot still production process for many years.\n\nIn 1966 John Jameson merged with Cork Distillers and John Powers to form the Irish Distillers Group. In 1976, the Dublin whiskey distilleries of Jameson in Bow Street and in John's Lane were closed following the opening of a New Midleton Distillery by Irish Distillers outside Cork. The Midleton Distillery now produces much of the Irish whiskey sold in Ireland under the Jameson, Midleton, Powers, Redbreast, Spot and Paddy labels. The new facility adjoins the Old Midleton Distillery, the original home of the Paddy label, which is now home to the Jameson Experience Visitor Centre and the Irish Whiskey Academy. The Jameson brand was acquired by the French drinks conglomerate Pernod Ricard in 1988, when it bought Irish Distillers. The old Jameson Distillery in Bow Street near Smithfield in Dublin now serves as a museum which offers tours and tastings. The distillery went through a $12.6 million renovation that was concluded in March 2016, and is now a focal part of Ireland's strategy to raise the number of whiskey tourists, which stood at 600,000 in 2017. \n\nIn 2008, The Local, an Irish pub in Minneapolis, sold 671 cases of Jameson (22 bottles a day), making it the largest server of Jameson's in the world – a title it maintained for four consecutive years.\n\nAs well as Jameson Original, other Jameson expressions include:\n\n\nJameson is produced from a blend of grain whiskey and single pot still whiskey, which uses a mixture of malted and unmalted or \"green\" Irish barley, all sourced from within a fifty-mile radius around the distillery in Cork. The barley is dried in a closed kiln fired by natural gas (formerly anthracite coal). This is in contrast to the traditional method used in some Scotch whisky distilleries, which fire the kiln with peat, adding a distinctive peat flavour.\n\nJameson products – in particular its 18-Year and its Rarest Reserve – have rated very highly at international spirit ratings competitions. The 18-Year received a series of gold and double gold medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2005 and 2010. The Rarest Reserve has won gold and double gold medals there as well. Rarest Reserve is rated as one of the Top 20 whiskies in the world by Proof66.\n\nJohn Jameson was also the great grandfather of inventor Guglielmo Marconi.\n\n"}

The German language includes several different kinds of adverbial phrases.\n\nMany adverbs are not derived from an adjective. Often they have very important meanings. For example, \"nicht\", \"leider\" or \"gerne\" (\"not\", \"unfortunately\", \"gladly\").\n\nThe duration or the spatial extent of a verb's action can be expressed by a nominal expression in the accusative case.\n\n\"Das Kind malte die ganze Zeit Bilder\" (\"The child was painting pictures all the time\")\n\nAdverb formation is simpler in German than in most other languages. An adverb is simply the uninflected form of the adjective (or participle). This holds for the positive and comparative forms. The superlative is formed with the preposition \"am\" and the ending \"-en\", e.g. am schönsten \"most beautifully\". Only a limited number of adverbs have a special elative form ending in \"-stens\", e.g. \"schnellstens\" ('as fast as possible'), \"bestens\" ('very well').\n\nThe adverb can be used to describe actions, adjectives or other adverbs. Comparative and superlative forms are unusual in the last two situations.\n\nIn English, adverbs are usually distinguished from adjectives by the ending \"-ly\". In German, they may be distinguished by their lack of declension, because adjectives in attributive position must be declined. Compare:\n\n\nUnlike English, the German language distinguishes adverbs which qualify verbs or adjectives from those which qualify whole sentences. For the latter case, many German adjectives form a special adverb form ending in \"-erweise\", e.g. \"glücklicherweise\" \"luckily\", \"traurigerweise\" \"sadly\" (from \"Weise\" = way, manner).\n\nIn the following two example sentences, the adverb \"lustig\" \"funnily\" qualifies the verb, while \"lustigerweise\" \"funnily\" qualifies the whole sentence:\n\n\nAs in the above example, English usually expresses the difference by placing the adverb which qualifies a sentence, in the beginning. In German, it can be placed in the beginning or elsewhere in the sentence.\n\nA prepositional phrase consists of a nominal phrase and an adposition (a preposition, postposition, or circumposition). The case of the nominal phrase can be accusative or dative. Some prepositions always take the accusative case and some always take the dative case. Students usually memorize these because the difference may not be intuitive. A third group of prepositions, called \"two way prepositions\", take either the accusative case or the dative case depending on the phrase's exact meaning. If the statement describes movement across a boundary then the phrase is accusative. Other situations, including movement within a confined area, take the dative case. For example:\n\nNote that prepositions do not always have a locative meaning; they can also be modal or temporal adverbs, for example.\n\nPrepositional phrases, being adverbial, may be used to describe actions and adjectives. They can also be attributes of a nominal phrase.\n\nIn some cases, the preposition and the article of the nominal phrase may or must elide together. This is similar to Italian.\n\nA real position can be substituted by a pronominal adverb.\n\nPronominal adverbs may be preceded by an adverbial clause. See below.\n\nBesides prepositional phrases and pronominal adverbs, there are also adverbial clauses. They can be applied to actions as well as to nominal phrases and pronominal adverbs.\n\nSuch a sentence can also completely replace a position or pronominal adverb.\n"}

Several different recipes for making peanut sauces exist, resulting in a variety of flavours, textures and consistency. A typical recipe usually contains ground roasted peanuts or peanut butter (smooth or crunchy), coconut milk, soy sauce, tamarind, galangal, garlic, and spices (such as coriander seed or cumin). Other possible ingredients are chili peppers, sugar, fried onion, and lemongrass. The texture and consistency (thin or thick) of a peanut sauce corresponds to the amount of water being mixed in it.\n\nIn Western countries, the readily and widely available peanut butter is often used as a substitute ingredient to make peanut sauce. To achieve authenticity, some recipes might insist on making roasted ground peanuts from scratch, using traditional stone mortar and pestle for grinding to achieve desired texture, graininess and earthy flavour of peanut sauce.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of Indonesian cuisine is the wide applications of \"bumbu kacang\" (peanut sauce) in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as satay, \"gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, rujak\" and \"pecel\". It is usually added to main ingredients (meat or vegetable) to add taste, used as dipping sauce such as \"sambal kacang\" (a mixture of ground chilli and fried peanuts) for \"otak-otak\" or \"ketan\" or as a dressing on vegetables. Introduced from Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish merchants in the 16th century, peanuts found a place within Indonesian cuisine as a popular sauce. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia, and today, they can be found roasted and chopped finely, topping a variety of dishes and in marinades and dipping sauces. Peanut sauce reached its sophistication in Indonesia, with the delicate balance of taste acquired from various ingredients according to each recipe of peanut sauce; fried peanuts, \"gula jawa\" (palm sugar), garlic, shallot, ginger, tamarind, lemon juice, lemongrass, salt, chilli, pepper, sweet soy sauce, ground together and mixed with water to acquire right texture. The secret to good peanut sauce is \"not too thick and not too watery.\" Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than the Thai one (which is a hybrid adaptation). Gado-gado is eaten with peanut sauce throughout Indonesia showcasing the delicate balance of sweet, spicy and sour.\n\nThe Netherlands adopted peanut sauce as a common side dish through its former possessions in South East Asia. Besides being used in certain traditional Indonesian and Dutch-Indonesian dishes, it has found its way in to a purely Dutch context when it is eaten during, for instance, a (non Asian style) barbecue or with French fries. A popular combination at Dutch fast food outlets is French fries with mayonnaise and peanut sauce (often with raw chopped onions), called a \"Patat Oorlog\" (lit. \"French fries War\"). Peanut sauce is also eaten with baguette, bread, cucumber or potatoes. It is also used as an ingredient in the deep-fried snack food called \"Satékroket\", a croquette made with a flour-thickened ragout based on Indonesian satay.\n\nIn Chinese cooking, the sauce is often used on grilled meat. Other uses include hot pot and Dan dan noodles. In Singapore, peanut sauce is not only used as dipping sauce for satay. It is also eaten with rice vermicelli known as Satay bee hoon. In Vietnam, it is called \"tương đậu phộng\" and is used in \"cuốn diếp\" dish.\n\nIn South India, \"\"groundnut chutney\"\" (spicy peanut sauce) is served along with breakfast, such as idli and dosa. Variations include \"\"Palli chutney\"\" (spiced whole peanut chutney) in Andhra Pradesh and \"\"Kadalai chutney\"\" in Tamil Nadu, as well as \"\"Coconut & Peanut Chutney\"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "4404443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4404443", "title": "Coin board", "text": "Coin board\n\nTwo kinds of coin board exist.\n\nThe first kind, also known as a merchandise board, is a variation on pull-tab games. A game board of this type typically comes with a registered package of pull-tab tickets, a signers card, and a pay-out slip.\n\nWhen a ticket is sold, the player opens the ticket to reveal its hidden numbers. If a number on the ticket matches a number on the game board, the player wins a prize and/or a chance at one or more seal prizes, which are revealed at the end of the game.\n\nThe game board displays the winning numbers along with the prizes. Some of the winners receive instant cash only, while some of the winning numbers match numbers on coins, wallets, or small panels that are built into the board. When a player opens a ticket containing one of these numbers, the game manager removes the coin or panel and gives it to the player. When the coin or panel is removed, a prize is revealed that may consist of instant cash, merchandise, and/or a chance at a seal prize. Instant cash or merchandise winnings are given to the player immediately by the manager.\n\nIf a player wins a chance at a seal prize, that player's name is added to the signers card. When the game ends—all the tickets sell out, or all the prizes are won—the manager opens the seals on the game board (or, in some versions, scratches off an opaque substance) to reveal the winning numbers. The players whose names appear next to the winning numbers on the signers card win a seal prize. The seal prizes are usually the most valuable prizes.\n\nUnited States collector coins are embedded in most coin boards sold in the US. Sometimes they are visible, and sometimes they are hidden behind panels. \"Coin boards\" contain only coin and cash prizes. \"Merchandise boards\" also contain coins, but some or all of the prizes consist of merchandise rather than cash.\n\nThe \"pay-out slip\" that is typically provided with each board lists the number of winners and values of all prizes. This information may be used for accounting purposes and to verify that the game complies with local gaming regulations.\n\nThe second kind of coin board, also known as a coin collecting board, is intended for coin collectors to assemble a complete set of dates and mints for a particular coin series. It consists of a strip of cardboard, typically measuring 11 inches wide by 14 inches tall, with holes punched into it the size of the particular coins. A face paper having the same hole pattern carries the appropriate text and graphics. This typically consists of dates and mintmarks printed beneath each opening, sometimes with the addition of the number of pieces coined for that issue. A bold title for the coin series will appear at the top of the board, and the bottom of the face will have publication and copyright information. On some coin boards the bottom of the face will also provide some historical and technical information about the coin series, as well as misguided instructions for cleaning coins. On the most common coin boards, those published by Whitman, this information was later moved to the back of the board, and this is more typical for other publishers, too.\n\nThe coin collecting board was invented in 1934 by Joseph Kent Post, an engineer with Kimberly-Clark in Neenah, Wisconsin. His knowledge of paper products and their manufacture, combined with his interest in coin collecting, prompted him to devise this inexpensive means to collect coins. Debuting early in 1935, his first coin boards—one for Indian Head nickels and another for Lincoln cents—were priced at 25 cents retail, and these quickly proved successful. Sold at newsstands, stationery stores, variety stores, and similar retail outlets, coin boards were the point of entry for thousands of new coin collectors between 1935 and 1942, after which most publishers discontinued them in favor of the more convenient coin folders still used today. \n\nPost marketed his coin boards under the Kent Co. Coin Card brand. Later in 1935, Post sold his invention to Whitman Publishing of Racine, Wisconsin, which was already a leading producer of puzzles, games and other paper novelties. Whitman became the most prolific of coin board producers and had the most extensive list of coin series titles.\n\nOther publishers of coin boards included Colonial Coin & Stamp Company and Gramercy Stamp Company, both located in New York City, J. Oberwise & Company and Lincoln Printing Company, both located in Los Angeles, California, and Earl & Koehler of Portland, Oregon. Whitman and Oberwise boards are seen with some frequency, but the other companies' boards are fairly scarce, those of Gramercy and E & K being genuinely rare. Coin collecting boards have been retired from their original usage for the most part, and all are now considered quite collectable. Their collector value varies with their relative rarity and condition.\n"}

{"id": "4417843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4417843", "title": "Karate kata", "text": "Karate kata\n\nKata (, or more traditionally, 型; lit. \"form\") is a Japanese word describing detailed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. Karate kata are executed as a specified series of a variety of moves, with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. The kata is not intended as a literal depiction of a mock fight, but as a display of transition and flow from one posture and movement to another, teaching the student proper form and position, and encouraging them to visualise different scenarios for the use of each motion and technique. Karateka \"read\" a kata in order to explain the imagined events, a practice known as \"bunkai\". There are various kata, each with many minor variations.It will finally gain larger recognition with the addition of Kata to the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nTraditionally, kata are taught in stages. Previously learned kata are repeated to show better technique or power as a student acquires knowledge and experience. It is common for students testing to repeat every kata they have learned but at an improved level of quality.\n\nThe various styles of karate study different kata, or variations of a common core. Some kata may therefore be known by two names, one in Japanese, the other in Okinawan or Chinese. This is because Gichin Funakoshi, and others, renamed many kata to help Karate spread throughout Japan.\n\nKata originated from the practice of paired attack and defence drills by ancient Chinese martial artists. However, as the numbers of attacks and defences being practised increased the difficulty of remembering all of the drills also increased. An additional problem with the drills was the requirement for a partner to be present for all practice. Kata/forms were created as solo forms containing the concatenated sequences of movements of the defensive portions of the drills. The initial forms being simply strings of movements, sets of rules were created to allow the creation of kata which could fit comfortably within training spaces.\n\nThe number 108 has mythological significance in Dharmic religions. This number also figures prominently in the symbolism associated with Karate, particularly the Goju-ryū discipline. The ultimate Gōjū-ryū kata, \"Suparinpei\", literally translates to 108. \"Suparinpei\" is the Chinese pronunciation of the number 108, while \"gojushi\" of Gojūshiho is the Japanese pronunciation of the number 54. The other Gōjū-ryū kata, \"Sanseru\" (meaning \"36\") and \"Seipai\" (\"18\") are factors of the number 108.\n\nOther Buddhist symbols within Karate include the term karate itself, the character kara can also be read as ku, which originates from sunya, positioning at the beginning of kata resembles the hand position of zazen, and custom of the bow upon entering and leaving the dojo and meeting the sensei, as is done in Buddhist temples and Zen dojo.\n\nSome kata and/or styles are not included here, due but not limited to popularity and common usage for kata, and recognition (or not) of styles by the various governing bodies.\n\n"}

Introduced in the 1930s, and long produced by Chicago's Carl Jeppson Company – in 2018, as its last employee was retiring, the brand was sold to C.H. Distillery of Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood. Jeppson's Malört is named after Carl Jeppson, the Swedish immigrant who first distilled and popularized the liquor in Chicago. \"Malört\" is the Swedish word for wormwood, which is the key ingredient in a bäsk, a bitter-flavored type of Swedish brännvin.\n\nMalört is known for its bitter taste. It can be found in some Chicago-area taverns and liquor stores, and is growing in popularity there, but was seldom seen elsewhere in the United States. Malort spread to Denver, Colorado via a former Chicago bartender in the mid-2000s and some bars in Washington, D.C. began serving it in 2014.\n\nIn the 1930s Carl Jeppson, a Swedish immigrant to Chicago, began marketing his home-made brew. Attorney George Brode purchased the original recipe from Carl Jeppson and created the famous Jeppson's Malört testimonial that once appeared on every bottle. Patricia Gabelick was hired by Brode as his secretary in 1966, and took over the business after Brode's death in 1999, running it out of her Lakeview apartment. \n\nIt was made in Chicago until the mid-'70s, when the Mar-Salle distillery that produced it for the Carl Jeppson Company closed. It was made in Kentucky briefly, after which it was produced in Florida for many years. In 2018, Jeppson's Malört was acquired by Chicago-based CH Distillery, and in 2019 production was moved back to Chicago.\n\nFor many years the label on the back of the bottle said:\n\nThe label was changed and now it says:\n\nWhile Gabelick acknowledges that the drink is a \"niche liquor,\" selling a comparatively small number of cases annually, it has gained increased relevance among bartenders, bikers, and Chicago's Hispanic community, where Gabelick notes that it has become \"a rite of passage.\" The satirist John Hodgman has also adopted the drink in his stage show, offering shots to his audience. In an interview with Gothamist blog \"Chicagoist\", John Hodgman said Jeppson's Malört \"tastes like pencil shavings and heartbreak.\" \n\nFor many years, it was only sold in the Chicago area. In summer 2013, Chicago bar Red Door featured Malört–infused snow cones (it has a summer tradition of serving snow cones doused with alcohol). The liquor is mixed with Benedictine and Angostura orange. West Town's Hoosier Mama Pie Co. used Jeppson's in 2017 for \"a meringue-style pie\", called the “Chicago Sunrise”.\n\nIn Joe Swanberg's 2013 film \"Drinking Buddies\", drinking a shot of Malört is mentioned as a Chicago tradition for erasing past mistakes. In it actor Jason Sudeikis riffs that Malört is like swallowing a burnt condom filled with gasoline. In a similar vein, Tremaine Atkinson, founder of CH Distillery, was introduced to Malört when he first moved to Chicago, he compared it, \"to taking a bite out of a grapefruit and then drinking a shot of gasoline\". Malört makes up half of the beer cocktail called the \"Chicago Handshake\"; the other half is an Old Style beer. \n\nIn August 2015, the High-Hat Club was voted \"Best Malört Bar in Chicago\" and was awarded the Carl Cup, a perpetual trophy that is passed from past to future champions in a manner similar to the Stanley Cup.\n\nWhile \"Malört\" is sometimes seen as the common name for the style of liquor, Malört is in fact, a trademarked brand name owned by Carl Jeppson Company. The company secured the trademark on November 3, 2015. Other distillers that produced a similar spirit renamed theirs beforehand. Letherbee reverted to the generic \"Bäsk\", while FEW Spirits dubbed theirs \"Anguish and Regret\".\n\n\n"}

Essentially, in the Kantō region style, the eel is steamed before being grilled with sauce, which makes the eel more tender. The other is the Kansai region style, which is grilled without steaming.\n\nUna-don was the first type of \"donburi\" rice dish, invented in the late Edo period, during Bunka era (1804–1818) by a man named of Sakai-machi (in present-day Nihonbashi Ningyōchō, Chūo-ku, Tokyo), and became a hit in the neighborhood, where the Nakamura-za and Ichimura-za once stood.\n\nThe first eatery to sell it as a business is claimed to be , in (adjacent to Sakai-chō) at some indeterminate time, but presumably before the theaters burnt down in 1841 and moved off.

According to this version the \"unajū\" was already around by late Edo period, but there are detractors to this view.

The dough is sweeter than sandwich bread, but not as rich as cake, and the sultanas and raisins add flavour and texture to the final product. In Ireland it is sometimes called Bairín Breac, and the term is also used as two words in its more common version. This may be from the Irish word \"bairín\" - a loaf - and \"breac\" - speckled (due to the raisins in it), hence it literally means a speckled loaf (a similar etymology to the Welsh bara brith).\n\nBarmbrack is the centre of an Irish Halloween custom. The Halloween Brack traditionally contained various objects baked into the bread and was used as a sort of fortune-telling game. In the barmbrack were: a pea, a stick, a piece of cloth, a small coin (originally a silver sixpence) and a ring. Each item, when received in the slice, was supposed to carry a meaning to the person concerned: the pea, the person would not marry that year; the stick, would have an unhappy marriage or continually be in disputes; the cloth or rag, would have bad luck or be poor; the coin, would enjoy good fortune or be rich; and the ring, would be wed within the year.

It is usually made with cottage cheese and eggs. Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate multi-layered cakes.\n\nA derivative of the South Slavic verb \"gibati/гибати\" meaning \"to fold; sway, swing, rock\", the pastry was mentioned in Serbian linguist Vuk Stefanović Karadžić's \"Serbian Dictionary\" in (1818) and by a Slovenian priest Jožef Kosič in 1828, where it was described as a special Slovenian cake which is \"\"a must at wedding festivities and is also served to workers after finishing a big project\"\". It is a type of layered strudel, a combination of Turkish and Austrian influences in different cuisines of the former Yugoslavia - the strudel is most often associated with Austrian cuisine, but it was actually the Turkish baklava pastry, introduced into Austria in 1453, that laid the foundation for strudel. Today the versions of this cake can be found in Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, and other regions of the former Yugoslavia. Variants of this rich layered strudel are found in Hungary, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and Syria.\n\nIn the vocabulary of the Yugoslav Academy, as well as in the etymological dictionary of Slavic languages, the word \"gibanica\" is a derivative of the Croatian verb gíbati and Serbian verb гибати, which means \"to fold; sway, swing, rock\". There are also derivatives like the word / – one who makes gibanica, one who loves to eat gibanica, and one who always imposes as a guest and at someone else's expense. Some believe that the word \"gibanica\" actually comes from the Egyptian Arabic \"gebna\" (جبنة), a type of soft white salty cheese used in making gibanica.\nThe original recipe for Gibanica included traditionally homemade phyllo dough and cow's milk cheese. Homemade cheese can be feta or sirene. The pie is usually made as \"gužvara\" (crumpled pie), so the phyllo dough in the middle is crumpled and filled. Besides cheese, the fill contains eggs, milk, kaymak, lard, salt and water. Also, stuffing may include spinach, meat, nettle, potato and onion. In order to speed up preparation, phyllo dough from a store can be used and sunflower oil or olive oil can be used instead of lard.\n\nMany varieties of Gibanica and related dishes can be found throughout the Balkans; different gibanica are known as part of the national cuisines of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (Italy, where it is called \"ghibanizza\"), Greece, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, where it is usually called \"Banitsa\". Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate multi-layered cakes. The so-called \"Chetnik Gibanica\" is the fatter, greasier version; it received the name after World War II.\n\nFrom the basic recipe, many local specialties have evolved. Prekmurska gibanica, for example, is a \"fancy\" multi-layered cake from Prekmurje in Slovenia, served as a dessert course on festive occasions. Međimurska gibanica, from the neighbouring Međimurje region of Croatia, is a closely related but simpler and less \"formal\" dish consisting of four layers of fillings (prepared fresh cheese (quark), poppyseed, apple and walnut). Another gibanica variety, called Prleška gibanica, is known from Prlekija to the west of the Mur River.\n\nThe basic concept of Gibanica, a cake or pie involving a combination of pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, Anatolia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. For example, a similar dish known as Shabiyat (Sh'abiyat, Shaabiyat) is part of the cuisine of Syria and Lebanon. Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese strudel, with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires.\n\nGibanica is one of the most popular and recognizable pastry dishes from the Balkans, whether served on festive occasions, or as a comforting family snack. In Serbia, the dish is eaten as breakfast, dinner, appetizer and snack, and is often consumed at traditional events such as Christmas, Easter and Slava. The largest Gibanica ever made was in the town of Mionica in 2007. It weighed over 1,000 kg, and was applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records. Around 330 kg of phyllo dough, 330 kg of cheese, 3,300 eggs, 30 l of oil, 110 l of mineral water, 50 kg of lard and 500 packets of baking powder went into its creation. In Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia there are festivals dedicated to gibanica. One of them, called the Gibanica festival or Days of Banitsa, is held each year in Bela Palanka. It first took place in 2005. The Slovenian festival of Prekmurska gibanica and ham is held in the Slovenian region of Prekmurje , and the Croatian festival of gibanica is held in Igrišće in the Croatian region of Hrvatsko Zagorje. \n\n\n\n"}

After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly ferment) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of milk fat, typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact due to milk protein fibers) and a rich taste.\n\nThe word kaymak has Central Asian Turkic origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in Turkic. The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of Mahmud al-Kashgari, \"Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk\". The word remains as \"kaylgmak\" in Mongolian, and with small variations in Turkic languages as \"qaymaq\" in Azerbaijani, \"qaymoq\" in Uzbek, қаймақ in Kazakh and Shor, каймак in Kyrgyz, \"kaymak\" in Turkish, gaýmak in Turkmen, კაიმაღი (\"kaimaghi\") in Georgian, and καϊμάκι (\"kaïmáki\") in Greek.\n\nShops in Turkey have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional Turkish breakfast. One type of kaymak is found in the Afyonkarahiskar region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with baklava and other Turkish desserts, fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in pancakes.\n\nKnown as \"kajmak\", it is almost always produced in the traditional way, in private households; commercial production is also gaining in popularity, but the best kajmak is sold at markets in some countries on the Balkans. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest—only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but it becomes hardened and not as tasty as the fresh kajmak. Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks, and this variation is called \"skorup\". The word \"kajmak\" can also describe the creamy foam in the traditional \"black\" Turkish coffee in the Balkans.\n\nIt is usually enjoyed as an appetizer or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are considered open-air market days where best kajmak is found, but also as a condiment. The simplest recipe is \"lepinja sa kajmakom\" (bun bread filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as fast food. Bosnians, Montenegrins, Serbs, and Macedonians consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include \"pljeskavica sa kajmakom\" (the Balkan version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as \"ribić u kajmaku\" (beef shank, simmered with kajmak).\n\nIn Iraq, it is called Gaimar, Geymar or Qaimar and is very popular. Possibly derived from the ancient Sumerian word \"Gamur\" or Ga'ar which means cheese. Iraqi Gaimar is usually made from the rich, fatty milk of water buffaloes which are prevalent in the marshes of Southern Iraq. \nIt is available both factory produced and from local vendors (farmers) commonly known as Arab, Arbans or Madan, thus the product is sometimes referred to as Gaimar Arab, Gaimar Maadan, or farmer's Gaimar. \n\nIraqis like to serve Gaimar for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam. However the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \"Kahi\", smother it with date honey and then wash it down with hot tea. Gaimar on kahi with date syrup is a long-standing traditional breakfast all over Baghdad and throughout the whole of Southern Iraq.\n\nIn Iran, \"sarshir\" is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word \"kaymak\" (\"qaymaq\") is also used for the boiled method. \"Qaymaq\" is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran.\n\nIn Afghanistan, \"kaymak\" (\"qaymaq\") has a much thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread.\n\nIn the Adjara region of Georgia, bordering Turkey, კაიმაღი or \"kaimaghi\" is made from cow milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of Keda, Shuakhevi, and Khulo. It is typically eaten with Georgian cheese and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.\n\n\"Kaimaki\" in Greece refers to mastic-flavored ice cream that is widely available and often served alongside traditional desserts.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4444306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444306", "title": "Marbled meat", "text": "Marbled meat\n\nMarbled meat is meat, especially red meat, that contains various amounts of intramuscular fat, giving it an appearance similar to a marble pattern. \n\nMarbling can be influenced by selective breeding. Cattle breeds such as Angus, Herefords, Murray Grey, Shorthorns, and Wagyu, also British White cattle and dairy breeds, such as the Jersey, Holstein-Friesian, and \"Braunvieh\" have higher marbling scores on average versus other cattle such as Simmentals, Charolais, or Chianina. \n\nMarbling can also be influenced by time on feed, and type of feed, and relative feed value of feedstuffs. The longer cattle are fed a high-energy diet, the better chance they will grade higher on quality scores, but will have much lower yield grades (percentage of carcass lean to fat ratio). Feeding a high amount of cereal grains, such as corn or barley, will change the color of the carcass fat from a yellowish to a white and increase the chance of obtaining a higher quality grade, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nVeal has little to no marbling since young cattle develop subcutaneous fat first, kidney, pelvic and heart (KPH) fat second, intermuscular (between the muscle, or \"seam fat\") third and then intramuscular fat - \"marbling\" - last.\n\nBeef quality grades - A quality grade is a composite evaluation of factors that affect palatability of meat (tenderness, juiciness, and flavor). These factors include carcass maturity, firmness, texture, and color of lean, and the amount and distribution of marbling within the lean. Beef carcass quality grading is based on (1) degree of marbling and (2) degree of maturity.\n\nMarbling - (intramuscular fat) is the intermingling or dispersion of fat within the lean. Graders evaluate the amount and distribution of marbling in the ribeye muscle at the cut surface after the carcass has been ribbed between the 12th and 13th ribs. Degree of marbling is the primary determination of quality grade.\n\nMaturity refers to the physiological age of the animal rather than the chronological age. Because the chronological age is virtually never known, physiological maturity is used; and the indicators are bone characteristics, ossification of cartilage, color and texture of ribeye muscle. Cartilage becomes bone, lean color darkens and texture becomes coarser with increasing age. Cartilage and bone maturity receives more emphasis because lean color and texture can be affected by other postmortem factors.\n\nBeef yield grades - In beef, yield grades estimate the amount of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts from the high-value parts of the carcass–the round, loin, rib, and chuck. However, they also show differences in the total yield of retail cuts. We expect a YG 1 carcass to have the highest percentage of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts, or higher cutability, while a YG 5 carcass would have the lowest percentage of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts, or the lowest cutability. The USDA Yield Grades are rated numerically and are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Yield Grade 1 denotes the highest yielding carcass and Yield Grade 5, the lowest.\n\nThe USDA's grading system, which has been designed to reward marbling, has eight different grades; Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner. Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at restaurants and supermarkets. Choice is the grade most commonly sold in retail outlets, and Select is sold as a cheaper, but still nutritious, option in many stores. Prime, Choice, Select and Standard are commonly used in the younger cattle (under 42 months of age), and Commercial, Utility, Canner and Cutter are used in older cattle carcasses which are not marketed as wholesale beef \"block\" meat, but as material used in ground products and cheaper steaks for family restaurants.\n\n"}
{"id": "4445491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4445491", "title": "Serbianisation", "text": "Serbianisation\n\nSerbianisation or Serbianization, also known as Serbification, and Serbisation or Serbization (\"/srbizacija\" or посрбљавање\"/posrbljavanje\"; ; , \"sərbizacija\" or посръбчване, \"posrəbčvane\"; ; ; ) is the spread of Serbian culture, people, and language, either by integration or assimilation.\n\nJohn Uglješa, a fourteenth century Serbian despot who ruled much of Macedonia on behalf of Serb Emperor Stefan Uroš V attempted to Serbianise the monastic community of Mount Athos.\n\nSerbian historians in their historiography to demonstrate the Serb character of Bosnia and Hercegovina have cited that the region upon its submission to the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Patriarchate led to the Serbianisation of most of the territory.\n\nThe historical sources demonstrate that before the 19th century and the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire the majority of the ordinary Orthodox Christians on the Balkans had only a vague idea of their \"ethnic identity\". The local South Slavic-speaking peasants were accustomed to define itself in terms of their religion, locality and occupation. After the national states were established, peasantry was indoctrinated through the schools and military conscription, the official Church, and the governmental press. It was through these instruments of the state administration, that a national identity came into real and rapid development. \n\nThe Serbian Revolts between 1804 and 1815 gained autonomy from the Ottoman Empire that eventually evolved towards de facto independence between 1835 and 1867. In this period a two transitional ethno-linguistic territories between Serbs and Bulgarians existed. The first one of \"transitional Bulgarians\", between Niš and Sofia, and a second one of \"transitional Serbs\", between Niš and Belgrade. At the time the areas west of Belgrade were considered free of Bulgarian ethno-linguistic influence and as such motivated the Serb linguistic reformer Vuk Karadžić to use the Hercegovina dialects for his standardisation of Serbian. \n\nNational revival and statehood among the Serbs preceded the Bulgarian struggles (1860-1885) by some decades, which led to the full Serbianisation of the \"transitional\" Serbs between Belgrade and Niš in the first half of the 19th century. Nevertheless, Serbian sources from the mid 19th century, continued to claim, the areas southeast of Nis, including Macedonia, were mainly Bulgarian populated. Per Serbian newspaper, Vidovdan (No. 38, March 29, 1862), the future Bulgarian-Serbian frontier would extend from the Danube in North, along the Timok and [sic] \"\"Bulgarian Morava\"\", and then on the ridge of Shar Mountain towards the Black Drin River to the Lake of Ohrid in South. \nIn 1867, a Bulgarian society, active in Bucharest approached the Serbian state with a draft-agreement. The Bulgarian side proposed the founding of a common Serbo-Bulgarian (Bulgaro-Serbian) dual state, headed by the Serbian Prince. This state was to be named \"South Slav Tsardom\" and defined the territories that would constitute Bulgaria as follows: Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia. Serbian Premier Garašanin accepted the Bulgarian proposal in a letter from June 1867, but he diplomatically refused to sign the document, fearing how representative this organisation had been. On the other hand, the establishment of this common state concerned other Bulgarian organisations, which perceived it as an implementation of Garašanin's expansionist plan called \"Načertanije\".\n\nHowever, afterwards influenced by Načertanije's ideas, Serbian elites began to claim the \"transitional\" Bulgarians located south-east of Niš calling them Old Serbians. After the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire (1877-1878), Principality of Bulgaria was created, but the lands in the regions of Niš, Pirot and Vranje became a part of Serbia. It had successfully homogenized and modernized these new territories and in this way it assimilated the \"\"transitional Bulgarians\"\" of the Timok and Morava river valleys toward the end of the nineteenth century. Afterwards Serbia turned its attention to the region of Macedonia.\n\nIn 1878 Serbia became independent and pressure developed in the state for people from different ethnic groups to Serbianise religious denominations and their personal names. Serbianisation of identity along with ideological and cultural Serbianisation followed. Belgrade was reconstructed as a new capital by the Serb elite that removed elements of the Ottoman era. While Serb commonfolk looked for ways to aid the Serb cause and assist other Serbs still residing in areas ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Austro-Hungarian Serbs who had integrated within Serbia and promoted Serbianisation opened the country up to cultural and economic influences of Austria-Hungary in the 1880s.\n\nIn the late Ottoman period, representatives from Serbia such as the statesmen, diplomat and historian Stojan Novaković encouraged a separate Slavic Macedonian identity through Macedonianism to counter Bulgarian influence and the \"Bulgarian idea\" to separate the local population from Bulgarians and instill the \"Serbian idea\". Serbianising directly the local Slavic population through propaganda and education was difficult due to strong Bulgarian sentiments at the time in the region. The spread and promotion of Serbian Macedonianism was seen by Serbs as the first move toward eventually Serbianing the Macedonians.\n\nFollowing the First World War, the new Kingdom was reliant on patronage from the Serb monarchy that resulted in tendencies of centralisation and Serbianisation that other ethnic communities in the country opposed. In Belgrade a new government was formed after the war that quickly Serbianised the gendarmerie and made non-Serbs in the country view the new Kingdom as a extension of the old Kingdom of Serbia. \n\nPrior to 1918 most pro-Yugoslav Croat linguists supported the linguistic ideas of Serb linguist Vuk Karadžić. After the creation of the Kingdom and the official adoption of the concept of a Yugoslav nation composed of three \"tribes\", increasing numbers of Croats came to view Karadžić's ideas a disguised attempt at Serbianisation of non-Serbs.\n\nThe region of present-day North Macedonia until 1912 was part of the Ottoman Empire. According to Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 Edition, at the beginning of the 20th century the Slavs constituted the majority of the population in Macedonia. Per Britannica itself the bulk of the Slavs there was regarded by almost all independent sources as \"Bulgarians\". Immediately after annexation of Vardar Macedonia to the Kingdom of Serbia, the Macedonian Slavs were faced with the policy of forced serbianisation.\n\nThose who declare as the Bulgarians were, harassed or deported to Bulgaria. The high clergymen of Bulgarian Orthodox Church were also deported. Bulgarian schools were closed and teachers expelled. The population of Macedonia was forced to declare as Serbs. Those who refused were beaten and tortured. Prominent people and teachers from Skopje who refused to declare as Serbs were deported to Bulgaria. International Commission concluded that the Serbian state started in Macedonia wide sociological experiment of \"assimilation through terror.\" All Bulgarian books gave way to Serbian. The government Serbianized personal names and surnames for all official uses. Between 1913-1915 all people who spoke a Slavic language in Vardar Macedonia were presented by Serbia as Serbs.\nDuring the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the government of the Kingdom pursued a linguistic Serbisation policy towards population of the Macedonia, then called \"Southern Serbia\" (unofficially) or \"Vardar Banovina\" (officially). The dialects spoken in this region were referred to as dialects of Serbo-Croatian. Either way, those southern dialects were suppressed with regards education, military and other national activities, and their usage was punishable. Following the First World War Serbian rule was reinstated over Vardar Macedonia, the local Bulgarian or Macedonian population was not recognised and an attempted Serbianisation occurred. During 1920 the Orthodox community of Vardar Macedonia was placed under the Serbian Orthodox Church after payment was made to the Constantinople Patriarchate who sold its control for 800,000 francs in 1919. In Vardar Macedonia, Bulgarian signage and literature was removed, societies were shutdown along with the expulsion of Bulgarian teachers and clergy who had returned during the war. Names of people were forcefully Serbianised such as Atanasov becoming Atanasović and Stankov as Stanković along with a spate of repression that followed through arrests, internment and detention. \nThe Kingdom was also interested to change the ethnic composition of the population in Vardar Macedonia. Yugoslavia commenced a policy of forced Serbianisation through such measures as the Agrarian Reform which was a settlement plan. In 1919 there were announced the orders for preparing for colonization of Southern Serbia. The Serbian colonization was maintained through \"agricultural\" and \"administrative\" actions. In the Interbellum, the Kingdom has settled 3,670 families (18,384 persons). The colonists were given properties. Also, in the same time almost all clerks in the area were Serbs. This means that in the period between the two World wars the Kingdom succeeded through the agricultural and the administrative colonizations to create significant Serbian ethnic minority in Vardar Macedonia. Total numbers were 4,200 Serb families with 50,000 Serb gendermes and troops relocated from Serbia to Vardar Macedonia to advance the Serbianisation of the region and population. \n\nThe initiation of an educational campaign made children to learn that \"I am a true Serb like my father and my mother\" while their parents were not receptive of the Yugoslav state. Government authorities due to maladministration had difficulties in Serbianising the local population as they were strongly attached to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Exarchate) and Bulgarian nationalism. In Vardar Macedonia Bulgarian newspapers were banned in many areas and mail from Bulgaria remained undelivered within the region due to \"a technicality\".\nAs a counteraction to Serb efforts the paramilitary IMRO began sending armed bands into Yugoslav Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the locals. After 1923 the IMRO had \"de facto\" full control of Bulgarian Macedonia and acted as a \"state within a state\". It used Bulgaria as a base for terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial agreement of the right-wing governments. Because of this, contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border as the most fortified in Europe. Meanwhile several hundred political assassinations were organized by the Yugoslav security police led by Dobrica Matković. Following regular attacks by pro-Bulgarian IMRO komitadjis on Serbian colonists and gendarmes, the government appealed to Association against Bulgarian Bandits, responsible for the massacre of 53 inhabitants of the village of Garvan in 1923. Regions with pro-Bulgarian sentiments such as Tikveš and Bregalnica were violently Serbianised by Serb četniks that resulted in the population gathered up for forced labour and local leaders being killed. \n\nIn 1930s a more homogeneous generation was growing up in Vardar Macedonia, which resisted Serbianisation and increasingly identified itself as \"Macedonian\", but which also made it clear that Bulgarian idea was no more the only option for them. A sizable part of the local population nonetheless had undergone a transformation as Serbianised Slavs. The government and its widespread massive Serbianisation campaign was unsuccessful in trying to eliminate the traces of an emerging Macedonian national consciousness among the local population. During the interwar period Bulgaria resented the Serbianisation policy in Vardar Macedonia. In World War Two, the Bulgarian Army occupied southern Yugoslavia and their troops were welcomed as heroes who liberated the local Macedonian Slavs from Serbianisation.\n\nThe Serbian attempt at the Serbianisation of Kosovo and Albanian reaction toward resisting those efforts has been a factor contributing to conflict among Albanians and the Serbs. The region was strategically important for the state and its security with the local Albanian population deemed as \"unreliable\". Kosovo from the early twentieth century was exposed to the politics of Serbianisation through violence and administrative measures such as replacing Albanians with another population. In the aftermath of the First World War Serbian control over Kosovo was restored and the Kingdom attempting to counteract Albanian separatism pursued a policy to alter the national and religious demographics of Kosovo and to Serbianise the area. The government implemented policies such as the Agrarian Reform. It was a settlement plan to encourage Serb and Montenegrin settlers from other parts of Yugoslavia to resettle in Kosovo through preferential treatment of financial and land incentives to strengthen the Slavic element. Albanian land was illegally confiscated, often through expropriations and Albanians were encouraged to leave the region. Between 1918 to 1923, as a result of state policies 30,000 and 40,000 mainly Muslim Albanians migrated to the Turkish regions of Izmir and Anatolia. Albanian historians state that during the whole interwar period 300,000 Albanians left Yugoslavia due to duress. By 1931 the Serbianisation efforts had failed as Albanians still composed 63% of the Kosovan population. Other parts of the Serbianisation policy in Kosovo included establishing an effective government administration and refusing autonomous Albanian cultural development in the region.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the government through its policy subjected ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina to Serbianisation.\n\nAfter WWII Marshal Tito formed out SR Macedonia of a part of 1929–1941 Vardar Banovina, and encouraged the development of Macedonian identity and Macedonian as a separate South Slavic language. The Macedonian national feelings were already ripe, but some researchers argue that even then, it was questionable whether the Macedonian Slavs considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians. Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a separate Macedonian nation to quiet the fears of the Slavic population that a new Yugoslavia would continue to follow the policies of forced serbianization. For the Yugoslav authorities to recognize the local Slavs as Bulgarians would be to admit, they should be part of Bulgaria. In fact the recognition of the Macedonian language and nation aimed to de-bulgarize the local population and to create a national consciousness that would support the identification with Yugoslavia. As result persons continuing to declare Bulgarian identity were again imprisoned or went into exile, and so Vardar Macedonia was finally de-bulgarised.\n\nToday some researchers have described the process of codifying the Macedonian language during 1945 - 1950 as 'Serbianization'. Within the period of Macedonian language codification two tendencies emerged: one language majority, that was pro-Macedonian, with some pro-Bulgarian biases, and one language minority openly pro-Serbian. The language minority, with the help of the Yugoslav political establishment defeated the language majority. Macedonian became a “first” official language in the newly proclaimed SR Macedonia, where Serbian was declared as “second” language, while Bulgarian was prohibited. The irreversible turning point of Serbianisation of the Macedonian standard took place in the late 1950s. On the other hand during the time of federation in Socialist Yugoslavia, Yugoslav citizens learned Serbo-Croatian at school. This bilingualism was stimulated by the subordinated pro-Serbian elites in Yugoslav Macedonia. In this way the influence of Serbo-Croatian arrose so much, that the colloquial speech of the capital Skopje has been described as a \"creolized form of Serbian\". For Bulgarians, Macedonian nationalism represents the result of the Serbification process in the region. Bulgarian scholars and politicians maintain that the Macedonian language was Serbified as it adopted words from the Serbian language in the postwar codification process under Yugoslavia that the Bulgarian government has denounced.\n\nThe territories called Western Outlands were ceded by Bulgaria to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1920 as a result of the Treaty of Neuilly, following the First World War. All Bulgarian schools and churches there were closed. Serbian primary schools were opened, teaching and learning in Serbian, while Bulgarian was prohibited. In 1920 a Law on the Protection of the State was adopted, which forced the Bulgarians there to accept Serbian names and surnames. A large part of the population emigrated to Bulgaria. An armed conflict started in 1922 when pro-Bulgarian separatist IWORO carried out numerous assaults on the Tzaribrod–Belgrade railway. Bulgarians have received the status of a national minority after WWII. They live in the Caribrod and Bosilegrad municipalities and in some villages in Pirot, Babušnica and Surdulica municipalities. However in 1948 there was a sharp deterioration for several decades of the Bulgarian-Yugoslav relations, due to the Tito-Stalin split. The Bulgarian teachers there were expelled again. The population was subjected to humiliation, and systematic psychological terror. Bulgarians made the highest percentage among the minorities detained on Goli Otok labour camp after the WWII. This fact is one of the main causes of this community’s behaviour to convert into Yugoslavs and Serbs, but even to Shopi and Torlaks. The decades of geographic isolation of other Bulgarians, and the repressions additionally led this community to inability to build its own minority space for many years.\n\nDuring the 1980s, some Serb intellectuals criticised and the League of Communists and held them responsible for Yugoslavia's political and economic troubles while offering solutions to the \"Serbian question\" through discussions and explanations of the Serb predicament. One of the narratives that emerged claimed that under communism Serbs had abandoned their old traditions resulting in a loss of Serbian identity and unawareness of Serb interests with looming historical defeat in a process called \"de-Serbisation\".\n\nThe Yugoslav army (JNA) prior to the 1990s was a multi-ethnic force consisting of conscripts, regulars, commissioned and non-commissioned officers that for the highest ranks was determined though a ethnic principle of representative proportionality reflected in Yugoslavia's multi-ethnic composition. Serbs overall held most senior, middle and junior ranks. Following 1990-1991 during the later stages of the breakup of Yugoslav federation that descended into war the JNA underwent a process of Serbianisation. It transformed from being multi-ethnic into a mainly Serb organisation under the Serbian republic's President Slobodan Milošević who held control and command over the force. During the period non-Serb personnel defected to the new armies of the new post-Yugoslav republics and others who felt disillusioned yet were unable to defect resigned. Slovene, Croat, Macedonian and Muslim (Bosniak) officers left the ranks of the Yugoslav army. As the army became dominated more by Serbs a program has instituted to retire non-Serb personnel that resulted in 24 generals remaining out of 150 on the eve of when the JNA was formally disbanded on 19 May 1992. In that time 42 of those generals had been removed by General Božidar Stevanović during his campaign of Serbianisation. He belonged to a clandestine network called \"Vojna Linija\" (Military Line) that backed the Serbianisation of the JNA and Milošević placed Stevanović as head of the air force to accelerate the removal of military personnel deemed unreliable and non-Serb. Following these processes the JNA was impacted due to the realisation that Yugoslavia no longer existed and its priority shifted toward creating the frontiers of a new Serbian state. A campaign to shift the political orientation of the JNA to a Serbian character also occurred. \nAt the end of May 1992, over 90% of the JNA was composed of Serbs. The Serbianisation of the Yugoslav army created the conditions for their support of Serbs in the Krajina region of Croatia and Bosnia. Following the independence of Bosnia and formation of a new Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, the old Yugoslav army was divided into two new armed forces due to UN sanctions imposed on the federation. Several months prior to May 1992 a division of armies and its assets was planned as authorities in Belgrade assessed its involvement in Bosnia would receive a hostile international reaction along with being accused of aggression. JNA General Veljko Kadijević was appointed to carry out the task by redeploying all Serbs from Bosnia to local Bosnian army units and removing any Serbs not from the area. As such Belgrade later claimed to be uninvolved in the Bosnian War while Bosnian Serb military forces remained under its control. Seen as reliable by Belgrade, Ratko Mladić was promoted to general and given command over the Serbian armed forces in Bosnia while maintaining the fiction of a separate armed force as the old Yugoslav chain of command remained. Mladić and Serb Bosnian forces under his command followed Belgrade's Serbian nationalist aims and objectives. Serb military forces in Croatia were also under the control of Belgrade. \n\nOn 25-26 August 1993 at a gathering the Supreme Defense Council of retired generals, Milošević's full control over the Yugoslav army was complete as the few remaining traces of the JNA were done away with. It was succeeded by the Army of Yugoslavia (Vojska Jugoslavije -VJ). Serbianisation continued during the first few years of the new military force through purges of personnel arising out of a need to ensure the loyalty of the armed forces to Milošević. During the Yugoslav Wars, the Serbianised Yugoslav National Army was involved in the destruction of urban centres such as Sarajevo, Mostar and Vukovar. Territories within Bosnia conquered during the war by Bosnian Serbs were subjected to homogenisation and assimilation through Serbianisation. The processes of Serbianisation of the Yugoslav army resulted in the creation of three Serbian armies under the control of Milošević. Following the conclusion of the Yugoslav Wars of the early 1990s, the Serbianisation process of the Yugoslav army (JNA) was confirmed at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) by witnesses.\n\nIn the late 1980s Milošević promoted a Serbian nationalist platform that entailed the re-Serbianisation of two autonomous Yugoslav provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina. On 23 March 1989, the autonomy of Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation was revoked by the government of the Serb Republic and Serbianisation of the province followed. During the 1990s under the government of Milošević the Serbianisation of Kosovo occurred. Laws were passed by the parliament of Serbia that sought to change the power balance in Kosovo relating to the economy, demography and politics. Various measures included prohibiting the official use of Albanian, prevention of Albanian involvement in education, severely limiting the usage of Albanian symbols and efforts to deal with the imbalances of demography between Albanians and Serbs. In the education sector Serbian authorities pressed Albanian schools to follow the Serbian language curriculum and to achieve those aims Albanian teachers in the thousands were replaced with Serbs. Official reasons for mass dismissal of Albanian teachers were incompetence in the Serbian language and that Kosovo educational institutions were centres of resistance and counterrevolution that indoctrinated Albanian students. \n\nOther reforms of the Kosovo education system segregated Albanian and Serb students within schools while funding, teaching staff and educational facilities were allocated for Serbian students and Albanian students received little. An entrance exam in Serbian literature and language became compulsory for students to pass in secondary schools. The Kosovo police force underwent Serbianisation after accusations of maltreatment toward Serb and Montenegrin civilians were made by Serbian authorities against Albanian police that resulted in their dismissal. The Kosovo Albanian police force was replaced with Serb special police units of the Serbian Interior Ministry. Albanians were against the measures and as such riot police and troops prevented them through force from going to school with some educational facilities being surrounded by tanks to stop attendance by students. The Kosovo police force that was newly Serbianised maltreated the Albanian population.\n\nAt the University of Pristina similar reforms occurred and lecturers that were not sacked were told to teach in Serbian with the level of Albanians at the university declining to a small few toward the conclusion of 1991. Pristina University along with its students became an important centre of Albanian resistance to Serbianisation. The parliament of Kosovo repudiated Serbianisation and made a declaration of the province's independence, established an alternative government and ministry of education. Demonstrations by Albanians were followed by more dismissals and reprisals in the education sector which led to the establishment of an Albanian parallel education system consisting of sacked teachers giving lessons in private homes. Kosovan Albanian school textbooks of the interwar period of the 1990s referred to the Serbianisation of Kosovo through attempted colonisation and mass expulsion of Albanians by Serbs for a prolonged period of Kosovo's history in the twentieth century. Hospitals had their Albanian nurses and physicians dismissed. \n\nAnother aspect of Serbianisation in Kosovo was the implementation of a discriminatory language policy. In 1991 public discourse was Serbianised through a campaign by the government such as targeting signs and government organs that became unfamiliar to many monolingual Albanians. Kosovo media was Serbianised as 1,300 employees of Radio & TV Pristina were dismissed with television coming under Belgrade control and a propaganda tool for the government. Albanian newspapers were shutdown and the most popular newspapers placed under the control of the government while other independent papers allowed to exist were under constant pressure from the state. Cultural institutions of Kosovo only showed Serbian productions. Albanian municipal officials and industrial workers were also dismissed from their employment. State sanctioned Serbianisation overall resulted in more then 100,000 Kosovo Albanians losing employment with many made to leave their apartments while their jobs were given to Serbs that migrated into the region.\n\nSerbianisation entailed for Serb nationalists the resettlement of Serbs to Kosovo and limiting the favorable demographic position Albanians held. in Serbia during the 1990s the works of Vaso Čubrilović, a Serb nationalist writer became popular and its content dating from 1930s called for the dislocation of Albanians through mass resettlement. In 1995 a Serbian leader Vojislav Šešelj outlined in a Serb publication \"Velika Srbija\" (Greater Serbia) a memorandum similar to that of Čubrilović that called for the Serbianisation of Kosovo through violence against Albanians and their leadership aimed toward discrediting them within Western public opinion. Following similar themes the parliament of Serbia on 11 January 1995 passed the \"Decree for Colonisation of Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\". It outlined government benefits for Serbs who desired to go and live in Kosovo with loans to build homes or purchase other dwellings and offered free plots of land. Few Serbs took up the offer due to the worsening situation in Kosovo at the time. \n\nThe government in 1995 resorted to forcefully resettling in Kosovo the Serb refugees that fled from Croatia, with most leaving thereafter and few remaining that increased tensions in the area. Serbs selling property to Albanians was made illegal by the government, fines existed for Albanians that did not undertake their military service in Bosnia and Croatia. The government also made if difficult for Albanians living oversees to return and penalties existed for Albanian families that had more then a child while Kosovo Serbs were rewarded for having multiple children. Serbianisation of the Kosovo economy also occurred with areas inhabited by Serbs receiving investment, new infrastructure and employment opportunities, while Albanians overall were either excluded or had limited economic participation. In January 1999, the Serb police and army initiated a planned offensive against Kosovo Albanians that involved the violent liquidation of assets aimed at their displacement and Serbianisation of the region.\n\nFollowing the breakup of Yugoslavia, the official language Serbo-Croatian broke up into separate official languages and the process in relation to Serbian involved the Serbianisation of its lexicon.\n\nAfter Republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991 this process has continued. Under the leadership of Nikola Gruevski (2006-2016) the leading VMRO-DPMNE party has promoted pro-Serbian policy. In 2015 the former prime minister and leader of the VMRO-NP, Ljubčo Georgievski has claimed in an interview to Radio Free Europe that then authorities have a clear goal, to keep the country closer to Serbia, and at some future stage to join it the northern neighbor. According to him a classical pro-Yugoslav policy was being conducted, where confrontation with all the other neighbors was taking place, but the border between Macedonian and Serbian national identity has been erased. \"Stop the Serbian assimilation of the Macedonian nation\" was the motto of the billboards that were placed then on Skopje streets, through which the Party launched a campaign for preserving the Macedonian national identity. The pro-governmental press claimed that the \"Bulgarian\" Georgievski organised a new provocation. As result the billboards were removed quickly by the authorities.\n\nThe historical event that created the Yugoslav Macedonian republic on 2 August 1944 is viewed differently through political party rivalries. The Social Democrats (SDSM) celebrate it and the VMRO-DPMNE condemn it as part of a Serbification project.\n\nVoluntarily Serbianisation has been attributed to Romanians and Vlachs, since the 19th century.\nThe Hungarian minority in north Serbia (Vojvodina) has also been affected by Serbianisation since the aftermath of World War II.\n\n\n"}

It is a bitter with a straw-golden hue. Stones Bitter was first brewed in 1948 by William Stones Ltd at the Cannon Brewery in Sheffield. It was designed for the local steelworkers and became successful in its local area, becoming one of Sheffield's best known products.\n\nThe brewing giant Bass acquired William Stones in the 1960s, and began to heavily promote the keg variant of Stones Bitter, which eventually became the highest selling bitter in the country. However the keg version was promoted at the expense of the traditional unpasteurised and unfiltered cask conditioned version. In the 1990s, the ABV of Stones was gradually reduced, and, as ale sales declined, Stones reverted from a national into a regional brand. Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery, Stones has been brewed at a number of different breweries. When Bass exited its brewing business, Stones became a Coors brand (later Molson Coors).\n\nStones was promoted through a series of television advertisements in the 1980s that starred Michael Angelis and Tony Barton. It eventually became the United Kingdom's longest ever running bitter campaign. Stones sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship and its successor the Rugby Super League throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe head brewer Edward \"Ted\" Collins first produced Stones Bitter at the Cannon Brewery in 1948. It was designed for the steelworkers of Sheffield's Lower Don Valley. The product was formulated as the working classes began to favour bitter over the dark mild style of beer. The beer's straw colour made it reasonably unusual for the time, and its individuality helped it to become an immediate success. By the 1960s its local reputation was \"colossal\", and it accounted for 80 per cent of William Stones' sales. Stones had such a strong local following that it was described as being \"more of a religion than a beer.\"\n\nFrom 1979, keg Stones began to be promoted heavily nationwide, and the beer was introduced to the South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s Stones Bitter was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this ceased after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.\n\nStones Bitter became the highest selling beer for Bass Breweries from 1981, when it overtook Worthington E in sales. Stones was the ninth most popular beer in the United Kingdom in 1989, with two per cent of all beer sales. Demand was such that the Cannon Brewery was paying up to £1.5 million per month in duty by 1991. Cask conditioned Stones won silver in the Bitter category in the CAMRA Champion Beer of Britain in 1991. Stones was the highest selling bitter in the UK by 1992, a million barrel a year brand, described by Bass as \"a tremendously important brand with untapped potential\". That same year, Bass were criticised for reducing the ABV of Stones from 4.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent ABV in order to reduce the impact of beer duty. The current packaging was introduced in 1994, and evokes Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and blacksmiths, and protector of craftsmen.\n\nIn 1997, the \"Yorkshire Post\" described the beer as \"one of Sheffield's most famous exports\", and \"a name which carries as much pride as the Made in Sheffield stamp.\" In 1997, Bass decided to deprioritise Stones in order to concentrate on promoting Worthington as their national ale brand. Stones' ABV was further reduced to 3.8 per cent in August 1998, and then to 3.7 per cent a few months later leading to its derision in the \"Yorkshire Evening Post\". Following the closure of the Cannon Brewery in 1999, canned Stones has been brewed in Burton upon Trent and keg Stones in Tadcaster.\n\nThe cask conditioned variant was brewed by Highgate Brewery of Walsall, Thwaites Brewery of Blackburn and finally Everards of Leicester. It was restored to 4.1 per cent ABV and its original recipe in August 2006, with Coors claiming that it would be \"like [how] Stones used to taste.\" The product was discontinued in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, \"Off Licence News\" identified the canned variant as \"continuing a slow but sure decline that has seen its status redefined from national brand to Yorkshire regional over the last decade.\" As of 2012, Stones Bitter is among the twenty highest selling ales in the United Kingdom, with estimated annual volumes at over 100,000 hectolitres.\n\nThe recipes for brewery conditioned and cask conditioned Stones differed:\n\nBrewery conditioned Stones is brewed with a blend of hops from America (Columbus and Zeus) and Europe (Magnum and Admiral). The barley variety used is Pearl. The beer comes in kegs and 440ml cans, and is described as having a \"fragrant grapefruit-citrus hop aroma, [which] cuts through a characteristically sulphury background with a fruity edge. The unusual salts balance ensures that the bitterness isn’t dry.\"\n\nCask conditioned Stones used Challenger hops, and was dry hopped with English Goldings. It was described as having an aroma of hops, sulphur and grapefruit, with a salty, moreish and zesty taste.\n\nA major television campaign ran nationally from 1983 until 1991 with the tagline (coined by playwright Peter Whelan): \"(Wherever you may wander) there's no taste like Stones\". The series initially starred Bernard Hill and Tony Barton, although Hill was replaced by Michael Angelis from 1984 onwards. The advertisements followed the characters of Jeff and Dave as they got into scrapes in various overseas locations, with humorous results. By 1987 it had become the UK's longest running bitter campaign of all time.\n\nFrom 1993 Stones was only advertised in the north of England. The 1994-96 \"Sheffield Gold\" campaign was set in a steel foundry: a nod to the city's heritage, although it was filmed in the Czech Republic because Sheffield's own foundries were considered to be too clean and automated for the desired gritty and industrial effect. A spokesman for Bass explained: \"We wanted sparks and goggles.\" It was to be the final major marketing push for Stones, and as of 2012 the only marketing support for the brand is the provision of Stones branded glassware and bar merchandise for regular stockists.\n\nStones Bitter sponsored the Rugby Football League Championship from 1986 to 1995, and then its successor the Rugby Super League from 1996–7. A 1986–8 set of poster advertisements with the tagline \"Stones, sheer poetry\" supported the sponsorship. In 1995 and 1996, Stones sponsored the Doncaster Handicap and the Park Hill Stakes horse racing events. Stones Bitter are also proud sponsors of the most successful British Ice Hockey team the Sheffield Steelers, they have a sponsor on the bottom of their jersey.\n"}

It is a stylistic designation rather than one based on the laws of kashrut. Generally, kosher style food does not include meat from forbidden animals, such as pigs and shellfish, and does not contain both meat and milk. In some U.S. states, the use of this term in advertising is illegal as a misleading term under consumer protection laws.\n\nJews who do not keep kosher, but wish to restrict themselves to eating \"traditional style\" foods, usually not eating forbidden animals or mixing milk and meat, may consider themselves to keep kosher style.\n\nSome dining establishments, notably delicatessens, serve kosher style food. This usually means that they serve traditional Ashkenazic Jewish foods, such as bagels with lox, knishes, blintzes, matzo ball soup, and cold cut sandwiches. Almost always, when a restaurant calls itself kosher style, the food is not actually kosher according to traditional halakhic standards. Several notable restaurants in Lower Manhattan fit into this genre, including Katz's Delicatessen and Russ & Daughters. Canter's restaurant in Los Angeles and Montreal's Schwartz's deli also fall into this category.\n\nJews who adhere strictly to the laws of kashrut will not eat at kosher style establishments. Furthermore, the fact that such establishments appear to be kosher can be deceptive to Jews who are visiting an unfamiliar city and are looking for kosher food. Some of these establishments are also open on the Jewish sabbath for business when this is forbidden by Jewish Law. Others may choose to eat at such restaurants, but not consume meat or cheese at these restaurants.\n\nIn Toronto, several kosher-style restaurants (e.g., Meyers, Shopsy's, Colemans) now serve pork products, such as bacon, ham, ribs, and sausage in order to serve a larger number of customers. Some kosher-style hotdog restaurants, such as Max's Famous Hotdogs and The Windmill, use pork as well as beef hot dogs.\n\n"}

They are also popular in former Portuguese colonies and in other countries with Portuguese populations.\n\n\"Pastéis de nata\" were created before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the Jerónimos Monastery () in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Belém, in Lisbon. These monks were originally based in France where these pastries could be found in local bakeries. At the time, convents and monasteries used large quantities of egg-whites for starching clothes, such as nuns' habits. It was quite common for monasteries and convents to use the leftover egg yolks to make cakes and pastries, resulting in the proliferation of sweet pastry recipes throughout the country.\n\nFollowing the extinction of the religious orders and in the face of the impending closure of many of the convents and monasteries in the aftermath of the Liberal Revolution of 1820, the monks started selling \"pastéis de nata\" at a nearby sugar refinery to bring in some revenue. In 1834, the monastery was closed and the recipe was sold to the sugar refinery, whose owners in 1837 opened the Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém. The descendants own the business to this day.\n\nThe Pastéis de Belém were mentioned by \"The Guardian\" as the 15th most tasty delicacy in the world.\n\nThe cuisine of Japan was heavily influenced by Portuguese traders during the 16th century. Many iconic Japanese baked goods including \"pan\" (), called \"pão\" in Portuguese, and castella have their origins in this period. \"Pastel de nata\" is one of these. In additional to the traditional form of the pastry, some variations have been developed especially for the Japanese market by adding green tea flavoring. This green tea \"pastel de nata\" was eventually exported to South Korea and other Asian markets.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4461490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4461490", "title": "Microwave popcorn", "text": "Microwave popcorn\n\nMicrowave popcorn is a convenience food consisting of unpopped popcorn in an enhanced, sealed paper bag intended to be heated in a microwave oven. In addition to the dried corn, the bags typically contain cooking oil with sufficient saturated fat to solidify at room temperature, one or more seasonings (often salt), and natural or artificial flavorings or both. With the many different flavors, there are many different providers.\n\nThe bag is typically partially folded when it is placed in a microwave, and inflates as a result of steam pressure from the heated kernels.\n\nThe design of a microwave popcorn bag is specifically keyed to avoid popped kernel scorching, an undesirable effect that takes place when popped kernels are heated above .\n\nA susceptor, usually a metalized film laminated onto the paper of the bag, absorbs microwaves and concentrates heat at the film interface, thus ensuring a heat distribution focused on the hard-to-heat flavor coating so that the unpopped kernels are evenly coated prior to popping, thereby ensuring even flavor throughout the product. Additionally, some popcorn is flawed and will not pop because of possible damage to the shell, which allows the steam to escape. These unpopped kernels are known as \"old maids\" or \"spinsters\".\n\nAn early susceptor popcorn bag design was patented by the American company General Mills in 1981 (US Patent #4,267,420).\n\nCare in package design is needed for food safety.\n\nA safety issue is that the cooking time given on the packaging does not apply to all microwave ovens. Setting the timer and coming back later, after the timer's alarm has sounded, could result in the popcorn being burnt and smoking badly. Microwave popcorn makers suggest that the person cooking the popcorn stay near the oven to observe the popcorn as it cooks, and take the popcorn out when the time between pops is more than a few seconds.\n\nThe concern about microwave popcorn bag has increased in the last few years in terms of the waste and their harmful impacts on the environment. A study shows that food packaging accounts for almost two-thirds of the total volume of packaging waste. In addition, the coating materials used in microwave popcorn bags can have negative effects on the environment. Researchers have detected toxic chemicals in the bags, such as perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and their potential precursors. PFCs are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative, and potentially harmful. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been reported to be toxic. Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) precursors are proved even more toxic than PFCAs themselves. In addition, due to the persistence and mobility properties of PFOA, it has been detected in water, soil, air, and wildlife. To minimize the harmful impacts of PFCs on the environment, people have developed many treatment methods to remove them from aqueous solutions.\n\nResearchers have detected many PFCs in microwave popcorn bags used as coating materials for oil and moisture resistance. The most commonly studied PFCs are PFOA and PFOS. The amount of PFOA in some microwave popcorn bags is determined as high as 300 μg kg. Besides PFOA and PFOS, Moral et al. also determined other perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in popcorn packaging, including perfluoroheptanoic (PFHpA), perfluorononanoic (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic (PFDoA) acids.\n\nPFCs are toxic, non-biodegradable and stay in the environment persistently. Accumulation of PFCs in living organism can exert adverse effects in lab animals, aquatic life and humans. A study in rats has found that PFOA can induce liver, testes, and pancreatic tumors. The exposure of PFOS to rats may also results in abnormal glucose and lipid homeostasis in the gestational and lactational adulthood. PFCs have been found to inhibit the communication system and the gene transcription in rats. In addition, a study also suggested that PFOA exposure was associated with kidney and testicular cancer in people living near chemical plants. PFOA and PFOS can also cause membranous damage associated with apoptosis and DNA damage in aquatic organisms (particularly in fish) and negative effect on population growth rate of rotifer.\n\nDue to the toxicity of PFOA, major U.S. manufacturers volunteered to phase out production of PFOA by the end of 2015. In addition, the use of perfluoroalkyl ethyl-containing food-contact substances are no longer allowed by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in January 2016. However, although the production of PFOA and PFOS was reduced, the production of fluorotelomer-based chemicals applied to food contact papers is still increasing. Some compounds, such as polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants (PAPs) or fluorotelomers (FTOH), have been used in some brands of microwave popcorn bags. Those compounds are precursors of PFCAs, and evidence shows that they are more toxic than PFCAs themselves. Furthermore, they may also be degraded to PFCAs, and therefore leading to the increase of PFCAs concentrations in the environment and generating adverse effects.\n\nDue to the high energy of C-F bond (531.5kJ/mol) in PFCs, PFCs are extremely resistant to natural biodegradation. Once PFCs are released into the environment, they become contaminants. Evidence shows that water, air, soil, and wildlife have been contaminated by PFCs. For example, PFOA concentrations was up to 0.9 micrograms per liter (µg/L) in some wells in Minnesota between 2004 and 2008, and 0.4 µg/L is the provisional Health Advisory for PFOA in drinking water developed by EPA in 2009. Besides, Giesy and Kannan detected PFCs in fish, birds, and marine mammals around the world. People also detected PFOA in the arctic media and biota.\n\nBecause of the large amount of production of microwave popcorn bags, they have also become a significant contaminant source (PFCs) to the environment. Due to the disposal of coated paper and manufacturing activities, PFOA has also been detected in wastewater and biosolids. Soil near disposal sites are contaminated by PFOA as well.\n\nTo reduce the destructive impacts of PFCs on the environment, people have developed many technologies to remove PFCs from aqueous solutions, including adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation, photochemical oxidation, ultrasonication, bioremediation, plasma oxidation, and other techniques. These technologies require harsh treatment conditions, cause high energy consumption, and cannot be applied in large scale. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising technique to remove PFCs from contaminated wastewater. It has many advantages, such as relatively lower energy consumption, milder conditions, and higher removal efficiency.\n\nThe EO mechanism and the pathways of both PFCAs and PFSAs are stated below. At the beginning, the carboxyl or sulfonic acid group of PFCs transfer an electron to the anode, and the PFCs radical (CFCOO· or CFSO·) are formed. PFCs radicals are unstable, and perfluoroalkyl radicals (CF·) are produced. Then, the CF· radicals react with OH, O, and HO in four possible routes as shown in Cycle A, Cycle B, Cycle C and Cycle D. The detailed reaction processes are as follows:\n\nCFCOO→CFCOO⋅+e\n\nCFCOO⋅→CF⋅+CO\n\nCFSO→CFSO⋅+e\n\nCFSO⋅+HO→CF⋅+SO+2H\n\nIn Cycle A:\n\nCF· + ·OH → CFOH\n\nCFOH + ·OH → CFO· + HO\n\nCFO·→ CF· + CFO\n\nIn Cycle B:\n\nCFOH → CFCFO + HF\n\nCFCFO + HO → CFCOO + HF + H\n\nCFCFO +·OH → CFOH·\n\nCFOH· → CFCOO· + HF\n\nIn Cycle C:\n\nCF· + O → CFOO·\n\nCFOO· + RCOO· → CFO· + RCO· + O\n\nCFO· → CF· + CFO\n\nCOF + HO → CO + 2HF\n\nIn cycle D, volatile fluorinated organic contaminants are released.\n\nEO technique also has some disadvantages, such as high cost and complexity of setting up and operating an electrochemical cell. Due to these disadvantages, EO has not yet been commercialized.\nSome microwave ovens have a specific mode designed for cooking popcorn, which either uses factory-calibrated time and power level settings, or which uses humidity or sound sensors to detect when popping has finished.\n\n\n"}

The meat ranges in animal and cut and often comes from local butchers.\n\nIn the UK, a typical meat raffle would have approximately 25-30 tickets sold at £1 each, though there is considerable variation and some raffles are much larger. Depending on the specific raffle, when a winning number is called the winner can either pick their cut of meat or opt for a gift certificate. All proceeds typically go to a charity.\n\nAlso simply known as a meat tray, the tradition is well known in Australian and New Zealand pubs. The trays of meat raffled vary in content: a barbecue style mix of steaks, lamb chops, sausages etc. is the most common, however \"breakfast trays\" (bacon, eggs, sausages) and \"seafood trays\" (prawns, oysters, mussels) are also common. Meat trays are usually raffled to raise money for local sporting teams, often those associated with the particular pub the raffle occurs in. The proceeds often help fund the team's end of season trip.\nCare must be taken with seafood trays given the propensity for the contents to spoil in the heat as the lucky winner continues drinking; often a friendly publican will store the tray in the fridge until the winner is sufficiently refreshed and ready to head home. \n\nAn Australian variant of the meat raffle is the chook raffle, where a chicken is raffled off. A Canadian variant popular primarily in the Sudbury area is \"Porketta Bingo\", in which a traditional Italian porchetta is given as a prize in a card game as a fundraiser for local minor hockey leagues.\n\nPart of the interval at the BDO World Darts Championship includes a meat raffle to raise funds for youth teams.\n\nThe Dave TV comedy show \"Compete for the Meat\", hosted by Al Murray, is loosely based on the concept of a meat raffle.\n\n"}

Such large loaves would feed a family for days or weeks, until the next baking day.\n\nBefore the advent of roller milling, virtually all wheat was milled by stone grinding. In order to produce a lighter, less chewy bread, the whole wheat flour was sifted or bolted using mesh or cloth. This resulted in a whiter flour that still retained some of the bran and germ. The addition of rye flour in some recipes probably originates from the presence of rye growing among the wheat. All the grain was harvested together, and as much as 10 percent of it would be rye. Rye flour ferments more quickly than wheat flour, and it imparts a distinctive flavor to traditional pains de campagne.\n\nWith the rise of commercial yeast at the turn of the 20th century, pain de campagne fell out of favor in French cities, where it was replaced by the baguette. However, with the rise of artisan breads in the 1970s, pain de campagne has been growing in popularity, both in Europe and the US.\n\nToday pain de campagne is still made in France, and is enjoying a growing appreciation in the United States and the UK. When made traditionally, the dough is allowed to ferment for several hours, allowing the yeasts to grow and develop the flavors. The dough is then rounded and placed in linen-lined baskets called \"bannetons\". After the dough has risen, it is dumped out of the basket and onto peel, and slid into the oven where it bakes at around 240 °C (450 °F) for about one hour.\n\n"}

The \"petals\" are formed around a disk, when removed, it creates a hollow center giving the impression of the center of the flower. The cheese is also available in a 'petit' version, weighing 200g (or 500g in England and 180 g in Germany) with a solid center.\n\nIt is not obvious why a name with a religious reference has been chosen.

Its popularity and common use is implied in the following witticism from the 19th century: \"\"Žganci\" are the pedestal of Carniola.\" This attitude implies its crucial meaning for the survival of the population. Freshly boiled \"žganci\" could be served as breakfast or lunch, or warmed-up or toasted for dinner or breakfast the following day. Belsazar Hacquet (1739–1815) mentions that \"žganci\" was served with sauerkraut in Upper Carniola. The oldest preparation method explains the word \"žganci\".

Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places which human beings might colonize; as resources for extracting minerals; as a hazard encountered by spaceships traveling between two other points; and as a threat to life on Earth due to potential impacts\n\nWhen the theme of interplanetary colonization first entered science fiction, the Asteroid Belt was quite low on the list of desirable real estate, far behind such planets as Mars and Venus (often conceived as a kind of paradise planet, until probes in the 1960s revealed the appalling temperatures and conditions under its clouds). Thus, in many stories and books the Asteroid Belt, if not a positive hazard, is still a rarely visited backwater in a colonized Solar System.\n\nThe prospects of colonizing the Solar System planets dimmed as they became known to be not very hospitable to life. However, the asteroids came to be imagined as a vast accumulation of mineral wealth, accessible in conditions of minimal gravity, and supplementing Earth's presumably dwindling resources—though the value of such minerals would have to be very high indeed to make such enterprises economically viable. Stories of asteroid mining multiplied after the late 1940s, accompanied by descriptions of a society living in caves or domes on asteroids, or (unscientifically) providing the asteroid with an atmosphere held in place by an \"artificial gravity\".\n\nThe idea of such isolated settlements, coupled with existing stereotypes of American mineral prospectors in the 19th century \"Wild West\", gave rise to the stock character of a \"Belter\" or \"Rock Rat\" – a rugged and independent-minded individual, resentful of state or corporate authority. Among such works is Ben Bova's \"Asteroid Wars\" series.\n\nAnother way in which asteroids could be considered a source of danger is by depicting them as a hazard to navigation, especially threatening to ships traveling from Earth to the outer parts of the Solar System and thus needing to pass the Asteroid Belt (or make a time- and fuel-consuming detour around it). In this context, asteroids serve the same role in space travel stories as reefs and underwater rocks in the older genre of seafaring adventure stories. And like such hazards, asteroids could also be used by bold outlaws to avoid pursuit. Representations of the Asteroid Belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks, so dense that adventurous measures must be taken to avoid an impact, giving dramatic visual images which the true nearly empty space would not provide. One of the best-known examples of this is the Hoth system in \"The Empire Strikes Back\".\n\nIn reality asteroids, even in the asteroid belt, are spaced extremely far apart. Proto-planets in the process of formation and planetary rings may look like that, but the Sun's asteroid belt does not. (The asteroid belt in the HD 69830 system may, however.) The asteroids are spread over such a high volume that it would be highly improbable even to pass close to a random asteroid. For example, the numerous space probes sent to the outer solar system, just across the main asteroid belt, have never had any problems, and asteroid rendezvous missions have elaborate targeting procedures. The movie \"\" is unusual in that it does portray realistically the ship's \"encounter\" with a lone asteroid pair.\n\nA common depiction of asteroids and comets in fiction is as a threat, whose impact on Earth could result with incalculable damage and loss of life. This has a basis in scientific hypotheses regarding such impacts in the distant past as responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs and other past catastrophes —though, as they seem to occur within tens of millions of years of each other, there is no special reason (other than creating a dramatic story line) to expect a new such impact at any close millennium.\n\nIn earlier works, asteroids provided grist for theories as to their origin – specifically, the theory that the asteroids are remnants of an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot-lines dealing with the possibility that the planet had been inhabited, and if so – that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from the past of the existing asteroids to the possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids.\n\nThe earliest explicit references to asteroids date from the late nineteenth century:\n\nAlthough the asteroids are commonly dealt with \"en masse\", a few belt asteroids have become known well enough to be mentioned in fictional treatments.\n\nDwarf planet Ceres is the largest and first discovered planetoid of the main-belt asteroids.\n\nAfter Ceres, Asteroid 433 Eros is perhaps the most-commonly mentioned asteroid, probably because it is one of the largest near-Earth asteroids.\n\nAsteroid 1566 Icarus, best known for its close approach to Earth and the Sun, has been the subject of multiple fictional works, such as:\n\nAsteroid 3 Juno is one of the largest belt asteroids, the second-most-massive stony S-type.\n\nAsteroid 2 Pallas is the third-largest belt asteroid.\n\n\nAsteroid 4 Vesta is the second largest of the asteroids.\n\n\nA common depiction of asteroids (and less often, of comets) in fiction is as a threat, whose impact on Earth could result with incalculable damage and loss of life. This scenario is based on such past events as the impact event responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. Such events are, however, sufficiently rare that there is no special reason to expect such an impact in the near future.\n\n\nWhen the theme of interplanetary colonization first entered SF, the Asteroid Belt was quite low on the list of desirable real estate, far behind such planets as Mars and Venus (often conceived as a kind of paradise planet, until probes in the 1960s revealed uninhabitable temperatures with a deadly carbon dioxide and sulfur atmosphere under its clouds). Thus, in many stories and books the Asteroid Belt, if not a positive hazard, is still a rarely visited backwater in a colonized Solar System.\n\n\nBefore colonization of the asteroids became an attractive possibility, a main interest in them was theories as to their origin – specifically, the theory that the asteroids are remnants of an exploded planet. This naturally leads to SF plot lines dealing with the possibility that the planet had been inhabited, and if so – that the inhabitants caused its destruction themselves, by war or gross environmental mismanagement. A further extension is from the past of the existing asteroids to the possible future destruction of Earth or other planets and their rendering into new asteroids.\n\nFor a list of \"fifth planets\" in fiction, see \"Fictional planets of the Solar System\"\n\nThe prospects of colonizing the Solar System planets became more dim with increasing discoveries about conditions on them. Conversely, the potential value of the asteroids increased, as a vast accumulation of mineral wealth, accessible in conditions of minimal gravity, and supplementing Earth's dwindling resources. Stories of asteroid mining became more and more numerous since the late 1940s, with the next logical step being depictions of a society on terraformed asteroids — in some cases dug under the surface, in others having dome colonies and in still others provided with an atmosphere which is kept in place by an artificial gravity.\n\nAn image developed and was carried from writer to writer, of \"Belters\" or \"Rock Rats\" as rugged and independent-minded individuals, resentful of all authority (in some books and stories of the military and political power of Earth-bound nation states, in others of the corporate power of huge companies). As such, this subgenre proved naturally attractive to writers with Libertarian tendencies. Moreover, depictions of the Asteroid Belt as The New Frontier clearly draw (sometimes explicitly) on the considerable literature of the Nineteenth-Century Frontier and the Wild West. And since (in nearly all stories) the asteroids are completely lifeless until the arrival of the humans, it is a New Frontier completely free of the moral taint of the brutal dispossession of the Native Americans in the original.\n\n\nAnother way in which asteroids could be considered a source of danger is by depicting them as a hazard to navigation, especially threatening to ships travelling from Earth to the outer parts of the Solar System and thus needing to pass the Asteroid Belt (or make a time- and fuel-consuming detour around it). Asteroids in this context provide to space travel stories a space equivalent of reefs and underwater rocks in the older genre of seafaring adventures stories. And like reefs and rocks in the ocean, asteroids as navigation hazards can also be used by bold outlaws to avoid pursuit.\n\nRepresentations of the Asteroid Belt in film tend to make it unrealistically cluttered with dangerous rocks. In reality, even in the asteroid belt, asteroids are spaced extremely far apart (even so, they can still be a risk to ships travelling at high speeds).\n\n\nA theme related to that of the Fifth Planet is the generation of a new asteroid belt, via the demolition of a planet, sometimes the Earth. It should be noted that the energy required to reduce a planet such as Earth to loose rubble is truly enormous: about 2 J, equivalent to the Sun's entire luminous energy output for about a week!\n\n\n\nSome works of fiction take place on, or in, asteroid-like bodies or fields outside the Solar System:\n\n\n"}

The Talmud states that it is forbidden to have any other food after the afikoman, so that the taste of the matzo that was eaten after the meal remains in the participants' mouths. Since the destruction of the Temple and the discontinuation of the \"Korban Pesach\", Jews eat a piece of matzo now known as \"afikomen\" to finish the Passover Seder meal.\n\nCustoms around the \"afikoman\" vary, though they often share the common purpose of keeping children awake and alert during the Seder until the \"afikoman\" is eaten. Following Ashkenazi customs, the head of household may hide the \"afikoman\" for the children to find, or alternatively, the children may steal the \"afikoman\" and ransom it back. Chabad tradition discourages stealing the \"afikoman\" lest it lead to bad habits.\nFollowing Mizrahi customs, the \"afikoman\" may be tied in a sling to a child's back for the duration of the Seder.\n\nThe \"afikoman\" is prepared during the fourth part of the Seder, \"Yachatz\". During this ritual, the leader of the Seder takes the middle piece of matzo out from the stack of three whole matzot on the Seder table. He breaks the matzo in two, returning the smaller piece to the stack and putting aside the larger piece to be eaten later during \"Tzafun\" (\"Hidden\", the twelfth part of the Seder, which immediately follows the main meal). This is the \"afikoman\", which is wrapped in a napkin before being hidden.\n\nThe custom of hiding the \"afikoman\" so that the children at the Seder will \"steal\" it and demand a reward for it is based on the following Gemara: Rabbi Eliezer says that one should \"grab the matzos\" so that the children won't fall asleep.\n\nThe Haggadah \"Otzar Divrei HaMeforshim\" cites several other reasons for the custom of stealing the \"afikoman\". According to Mekor Chaim - Chavos Yair, this custom demonstrates love for the mitzvah of \"afikoman\". Rabbi Menashe Klein, the Ungvar Rebbe, says that this custom is a re-enactment of the biblical account of Jacob stealing the blessings that were supposed to go to his brother Esau. \"Midrash Pliah\" says that Isaac told Esau, \"Your brother came with trickery\" (Genesis 27:35), adding, \"and he took out the \"afikoman\".\" According to the Midrash, this account took place on Passover. Therefore, the children steal the \"afikoman\" to get the blessings, which are the present that they ask their fathers to buy for them.\n\nAfter the meal and customary desserts, the leader of the Seder distributes pieces of the \"afikoman\" to each guest. If there is not enough to go around, additional pieces of matzo may be added to each person's portion of \"afikoman\".\n\nJewish law prescribes that an olive-sized piece of matzo be eaten to fulfill the mitzvah of eating the \"afikoman\". Many people eat an additional, olive-sized piece of matzo together with it. The first piece of matzo commemorates the \"Korban Pesach\" (Paschal lamb), whose meat was eaten at the very end of the festive Seder meal in the days that the Temple stood. The second piece commemorates the matzo that was eaten together with the meat of the Paschal Lamb in the days of the Temple, in fulfillment of the Torah commandment, \"They shall eat [the Passover lamb] together with matzo and maror\" (Exodus 12:8). Like the eating of the matzo earlier in the Seder, the \"afikoman\" is eaten while reclining to the left (in some Orthodox Jewish circles, women and girls do not lean).\n\nAccording to Jewish law, the \"afikoman\" must be consumed before midnight, just as the \"Korban Pesach\" was eaten before midnight during the days of the Temple in Jerusalem. Thus, if the Seder is running late with much singing and discussion of the themes of the Exodus from Egypt, families may have to shorten the meal segment of the Seder and proceed quickly to the \"afikoman\".\n\nAfter the eating of the \"afikoman\", no other food may be eaten for the rest of the night, other than the last two cups of wine at the Seder and coffee, tea, or water.\n\nThe Greek word on which \"afikoman\" is based has two meanings, according to the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud. Both Talmuds agree on the \"halakha\" (stated in the Passover Haggadah under the answer given to the Wise Son) that no other food should be eaten for the rest of the night after the \"afikoman\" is consumed. The Babylonian Talmud explains that the word \"\"afikoman\"\" derives from the Greek word for \"dessert\", the last thing eaten at a meal. The Jerusalem Talmud, however, derives the word \"afikoman\" from \"epikomion\", meaning \"after-dinner revelry\" or \"entertainment\". It was the custom of Romans and Greeks to move from one party or banquet to another. The \"halakha\" prohibiting anything else being eaten after the \"afikoman\" therefore enjoins Jews to distinguish their Passover Seder from the pagan rituals of other nations.\n\n\n"}

It is also a traditional Chinese sweet similar to floss halva or cotton candy, which can be found in many Chinese communities. Dragon's Beard Candy was initially created in China, but soon spread in popularity and became a regional delicacy in other parts of East Asia, as well as (and more recently) Canada, Singapore, the United States, Taiwan, Macau, and Japan.\n\nIt has a high sugar content (19%), and 2% saturated fat content. By comparison, cotton candy is fat free with a very high sugar content (94%). Dragon's beard candy has a very short shelf life. It is highly sensitive to moisture, and tends to melt when exposed to higher temperatures, notably during warm weather.\n\nThe following table presents the nutritional information of dragon's beard candy per serving (37g).\n\nThe legend of Dragon's Beard Candy was first notably practiced during the Chinese Han Dynasty. As the story recounts, an imperial court chef entertained the Emperor one day by performing steps involved in making a new confection. The process of making the candy involved stretching a dough-like mixture composed from rice flour into small, thin strands. These strands reminded the Emperor of a dragon's beard, and were sticky enough to adhere to one's face quite easily, so thus the concoction was there-forth named as Dragon's Beard Candy. The name may also be attributed to the status of the mythical dragon as a symbol of the Chinese Emperor, so presenting the confection as Dragon's Beard Candy was deemed acceptable due to the social nature of the candy, as it was reserved only for the ruling class, likely due additionally to the complexity of the preparation process. Dragon's Beard Candy provided a source of conflict several centuries later, however, as during the Chinese Cultural Revolution the Red Guard, acting in accordance to the orders of the Communist Party of China, forbade the Chinese populace to hold activities that could be attributed to the Han Dynasty. Because the initially rare nature of the candy was at this point combined with government enforcement of disdaining this art, the craft of making Dragon's Beard Candy became even more isolated and sparsely practiced. Nevertheless, in recent years, the art has resurfaced in tourist destinations such as various street festivals, and has even spread to farther reaches of the globe through dedicated masters of the task.\n\nTraditionally, Dragon's Beard Candy is made from sugar and maltose syrup, although recipes based on corn syrup are now used in the United States. The main ingredients of Dragon's Beard Candy include approximately 75 grams of fine white sugar, 75 grams of peanuts, 75 grams of desiccated coconut, 38 grams of white sesame seeds, 150 grams of corn syrup, and 1 bowl of glutinous rice flour. Due to the presence of large amounts of syrup, the candy has a very high sugar content.\n\nFor preparation of Dragon's Beard Candy, the preparer must initially boil and melt the saturated maltose solution (which may include sugar or corn syrup) for 5 minutes until thickened, followed by leaving the mixture to chill for 10 minutes until a solid state is reached. This resulting solid, which is somewhat flexible or elastic, is then formed into a torus. Next, the preparer must take the gooey sugar, corn syrup, or sugar cane based gel and dip it into the sugar dough. Thirdly, the gooey chunk must be shaped into a ring resembling a doughnut, the key feature being the large hole. This step must by followed by repeatedly pulling, twisting, stretching, and folding the dough over on itself, doubling the number of strands created after each repetition. While the candy is being folded, it is recommended to keep the dough covered in toasted glutinous flour to prevent it from sticking to surfaces. The dough must then be stretched into paper-thin strands, where each strand should be three to four inches long. Then, the strands should be tangled into a circular shape, and dipped into corn flour to keep the strands from sticking together. Finally, the ring should be cut into small pieces and wrapped around crushed peanuts, sesame seeds, crunched chocolate, or coconut inside. Specific Dragon's Beard Candy filling depends on several factors, such as region, purpose, and respective chef.\n\nThe candy is recommended to be consumed immediately after its preparation is complete, but it should remain fresh for up to six minutes in proper conditions.\n\nBoth cotton candy and Dragon's Beard Candy are made of sugar and share the characteristic of notable stickiness and a high sensitivity to moisture. Both substances will clump together when exposed to the air for a certain amount of time. However, cotton candy has a larger surface area, thus allowing a small amount of sugar to generate into a greater volume of product. Its serving on each stick is 37 grams, including food dyes and flavor, containing around 110 calories per serving. While Dragon's Beard Candy contain a lower content of sugar (7.2 grams), it contains a slightly higher caloric content of 141.2, as well as a higher fat content (6.1 grams), compared to Western-style cotton candy, typically containing 0g of fat. This is due to the fact that in addition to sugar, Dragon's Beard is composed of peanuts, sesame seeds and other ingredients, while cotton candy is close to 100% sugars. The nutritional value of the wrapping alone is essentially identical to cotton candy's.\n\nIt is common for street vendors of Dragon's Beard Candy to carry out the folding process involved in preparation of the confection at their stall, which can attract customers fascinated by the process as much as by a desire to purchase the candy. However, customers can purchase Dragon's Beard Candies through online stores.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4519063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4519063", "title": "Sujeonggwa", "text": "Sujeonggwa\n\nSujeonggwa is a Korean traditional cinnamon punch. Dark reddish brown in color, it is made from \"gotgam\" (dried persimmon) and ginger and is often garnished with pine nuts. The punch is made by brewing first the cinnamon and ginger at a slow boil. The solids are then removed for clarification and the remaining liquid is boiled again after adding either honey or brown sugar. The dried persimmons are cut into portions and are added to soak and soften after the brew has completely cooled. This is usually done several hours before serving, as extensive soaking of the fruit may thicken the clear liquid to a murky appearance. \nSujeonggwa is served cold and commonly as a dessert, much like \"sikhye\", due to its sweet taste. It is also widely available in canned form.\n\nThe earliest mention of sujeonggwa dates back to 1849 in the book \"Dongguksesigi\" (동국세시기, 東國歲時記), a book of seasonal customs written by scholar Hong Seok Mo (홍석모). The sujeonggwa recipe mentioned in the book is a dried persimmon brew with added ginger and pine nuts.\n\nIn the book \"Haedongjukji\" (해동죽지, 海東竹枝) written in 1921, sujeonggwa is known to have been prepared in the Goryeo era by palace women on New Year's Day. Then they were boiling ginger and adding persimmons to the brew. Its former name was \"baekjeho\" (백제호), literally meaning \"white milky beverage\", and was named after the white appearance of sugar-coated persimmons. Nowadays sujeonggwa is a popular traditional beverage drank year-round.\n\nThe recipe of sujeonggwa has changed by time, as seen in records. The recipe of sujeonggwa is first mentioned in \"Sujaguigwe\" (수작의궤,受爵儀軌). Ginger was not used in \"Gunhakoedeung\" (군학회등, 群學會騰), and cinnamon was first used in \"The Recipes of Joseon\" (조선요리법, 朝鮮料理法). Pear was used in \"The New Making of Joseon Food\" (조선무쌍신식요리제법, 朝鮮無雙新式料理製法) and liquorice, mandarin peels, whole black pepper was also sometimes added. Honey was originally used for sweetening but it was replaced with sugar after \"The Recipes of Joseon\".\n\nGeonsisujeonggwa is an original kind of sujeonggwa. It uses ginger and cinnamon as its main ingredients, and usually adds honey or sugar to taste sweet. Garnish with pine nut or \"gotgam\" (dried persimmon) on last.\n\nGalyeonsujeonggwa uses \"schisandra\" as its main ingredients, and adds honey or sugar to keep it sweet and the inside flower petal of lotus in the water. The leaves must be boiled and coated by starch powder.\n\nJabgwasujeonggwa adds chopped citron or pear in the sweet water. It is very similar to \"Hwachae\".\n\nThis variant uses pear instead of dried persimmon. In the past, people ate boiled pears (another name of Cinnamon Punch with Pear, in Korean, is \"Insug\") because most high quality pears are so stiff to eat. In order to make it easier to eat pears, they made them into a kind of cinnamon punch.\n\nThis variant adds pumpkin to the original. It is usually enjoyed in Gangwon-do.\n\nGinger, whole cinnamon, brown sugar, white sugar, dried persimmon (gotgam), walnut, pine nut\n\nGinger and cinnamon, the main ingredients of Korean cinnamon punch, are spicy but sweet; they makes the drinker feel warm, protects the intestines; and aids digestion if taken after a meal. Gotgam (dried persimmon) is rich in iron and vitamin C; it prevents colds and anemia. Some people put \"jat\"(pine nut), which is rich in unsaturated fat such as oleic acid, linoleic acid; it is good for the skin and it is effective for declining cholesterol and preventing hypertension. Additionally, it is rich in minerals like calcium and magnesium; it stabilizes the nerves and prevents various heart disease. Also, they are rich in vitamin A and beta-carotene.\n\nThe genus \"Cinnamomum\" comprises about 300 species, of which four species are used to obtain the spice 'cinnamon'. 'Ceylon/True' cinnamon (\"Cinnamomum zeylancium\") and Chinese Cassia cinnamon (\"Cinnamomum aromaticum\") are the most widely available varieties. Studies have demonstrated many beneficial health effects of cinnamon, such as anti-inflammatory properties, anti-microbial activity, blood glucose control, reducing cardiovascular disease, boosting cognitive function and reducing risk of colonic cancer. Also, there is a study about cinnamon can be a pharmaceutical agent in diabetes.\n\nGinger has been used for medicinal purposes since antiquity. In particular, it has been an important plant for the traditional Chinese and Korean pharmacopoeia. One of its indications has always been the treatment of nausea and vomiting. The aromatic, spasmolytic carminative and absorbent properties of ginger suggest that it has direct effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Ginger may be effective for nausea and vomiting. Animal experiments suggest that ginger has antiemetic activity when nausea is induced by cisplatin or cyclophosphamide. Studies in healthy human volunteers suggest that ginger reduces experimentally induced nausea.\n\n\n"}

Ghanaian main dishes are organized around a starchy staple food, with which goes a sauce or soup containing a protein sauce. The main ingredient for the vast majority of soups and stews are tomatoes- canned or fresh tomatoes can be used. As a result, nearly all Ghanaian soups and stews are red or orange in appearance.\n\nThe typical staple foods in the southern part of Ghana include cassava and plantain. In the northern part, the main staple foods include millet and sorghum. Yam, maize and beans are used across Ghana as staple foods. Sweet potatoes and cocoyam are also important in the Ghanaian diet and cuisine. With the advent of globalization, crops such as rice and wheat have been increasingly incorporated into Ghanaian cuisine. The foods below represent Ghanaian dishes made out of these staple foods.\n\n\n\n\nA deviation to the starch and stew combination are \"\"Red Red\"\" and \"\"tubaani\"\". These are primarily based on vegetable protein (beans). *\"Red Red\" is a popular Ghanaian bean and fish stew served with fried ripe plantain and often accompanied with gari, fish and pulses. It earns its name from the palm oil that tints the bean stew and the bright orange color of the fried ripe plantain.\n\n\nMost Ghanaian side dishes are served with a stew, soup or Mako (a spicy condiment made from raw red and green chilies, onions and tomatoes (pepper sauce). Ghanaian stews and soups are quite sophisticated, with liberal and delicate use of exotic ingredients, a wide variety of flavours, spices and textures.\n\nVegetables such as palm nuts, peanuts, cocoyam leaves, ayoyo, spinach, wild mushroom, okra, garden eggs (eggplant), tomatoes and various types of pulses are the main ingredients in Ghanaian soups and stews and in the case of pulses, may double as the main protein ingredient.\n\nBeef, pork, goat, lamb, chicken, smoked turkey, tripe, dried snails, and fried fish are common sources of protein in Ghanaian soups and stews, sometimes mixing different types of meat and occasionally fish into one soup. Soups are served as a main course rather than a starter. It is also common to find smoked meat, fish and seafood in Ghanaian soups and stews.\n\nMeat, mushrooms and seafood may be smoked, salted or dried for flavour enhancement and preservation. Salt fish is widely used to flavour fish based stews. Spices such as thyme, garlic, onions, ginger, peppers, curry, basil, nutmeg, sumbala, Tetrapleura tetraptera (prekese) and bay leaf are delicately used to achieve the exotic and spicy flavours that characterizes Ghanaian cuisine.\n\nPalm oil, coconut oil, shea butter, palm kernel oil and peanut oil are important Ghanaian oils used for cooking or frying and may sometime not be substituted in certain Ghanaian dishes. For example, using palm oil in okro stew, eto, \"fante fante\", \"red red\", egusi stew and \"mpihu/mpotompoto\" (similar to Poi). Coconut oil, palm kernel oil and shea butter have lost their popularity for cooking in Ghana due to the introduction of refined oils and negative Ghanaian media adverts targeted at those oils. They are now mostly used in few traditional homes, for soap making and by commercial (street food) food vendors as a cheaper substitute to refined cooking oils.\n\nCommon Ghanaian soups are groundnut soup, light (tomato) soup, \"kontomire\" (taro leaves) soup, Palm Nut Soup, ayoyo soup and okra soup.\n\nGhanaian tomato stew or gravy is a stew that is often served with rice or waakye. Other vegetable stews are made with \"kontomire\", garden eggs, egusi (pumpkin seeds), spinach, okra, etc.\nMost of the dishes mentioned above are served during lunch and supper in modern Ghana. However, those engaged in manual labour and a large number of urban dwellers still eat these foods for breakfast and will usually buy them from the streets.\n\nIn large Ghanaian cities, working-class people would often take fruit, tea, chocolate drink, oats, rice porridge (locally called rice water) or \"kooko\" (fermented maize porridge) and \"koose/akara\" or \"maasa\" (rice, ripe plantain and maize meal fritters). Other breakfast foods include grits, \"tombrown\" (roasted maize porridge), and millet porridge.\n\nBread is an important feature in Ghanaian breakfast and baked foods. Ghanaian bread, which is known for its good quality, is baked with wheat flour and sometimes cassava flour is added for an improved texture. There are four major types of bread in Ghana. They are tea bread (similar to the baguette), sugar bread (which is a sweet bread), brown (whole wheat) bread, and butter bread. Rye bread, oat bread and malt bread are also quite common.\n\nThere are many sweet local foods which have been marginalized due to their low demand and long preparation process. Ghanaian sweet foods (or confectionery) may be fried, barbecued, boiled, roasted, baked or steamed.\n\nFried sweet foods include cubed and spiced ripe plantain (kelewele) sometimes served with peanuts. Koose made from peeled beans (and its close twin Acarajé or akara made from beans which is not peeled), \"maasa\", \"pinkaaso\", and \"bofrot\"/puff-puff (made from wheat flour); kuli-kuli, \"dzowey\" and \"nkate\" cake (made from peanuts); \"kaklo\" and \"tatale\" (ripe plantain fritters); \"kube\" cake and \"kube\" toffee (made from coconut); \"bankye krakro\", \"gari\" biscuit, and \"krakye ayuosu\" (made from cassava); condensed milk, toffee, plantain chips (or fried plantain) and \"wagashi\" (fried farmer's cheese) are fried Ghanaian savory foods (confectionery).\n\nKebabs are popular barbecues and can be made from beef, goat, pork, soy flour, sausages and guinea fowl. Other roasted savoury foods include roasted plantain, maize, yam and cocoyam.\n\nSteamed fresh maize, \"Yakeyake\", \"Kafa\", \"Akyeke\", \"tubani, moimoi\" (bean cake), \"emo dokonu\" (rice cake) and \"esikyire dokonu\" (sweetened kenkey) are all examples of steamed and boiled foods whilst sweet bread, (plantain cake), and meat pie similar to Jamaican patties and empanadas are baked savoury foods. \"Aprapransa\", \"eto\" (mashed yam) and \"atadwe\" milk (tiger nut juice) are other savory foods. Gari soakings is a modern favorite. It is a blend of gari (dried, roasted cassava), sugar, groundnut (peanut) and milk.\n\nIn south Ghana, Ghanaian drinks such as \"asaana\" (made from fermented maize) are common. Along the Lake Volta and south Ghana, palm wine extracted from the palm tree can be found, but it ferments quickly and then it is used to distil akpeteshie (a local gin).Akpeteshie can be distilled from molasses too. In addition, a beverage can be made from kenkey and refrigerated into what is in Ghana known as \"iced kenkey\". Along north Ghana, bisaab/sorrel, \"toose\" and \"lamujee\" (a spicy sweetened drink) are common non-alcoholic beverages whereas \"pitoo\" (a local beer made of fermented millet) is an alcoholic beverage.\n\nIn urban areas of Ghana drinks may include fruit juice, cocoa drinks, fresh coconut water, yogurt, ice cream, carbonated drinks, malt drinks and soy milk. In addition, Ghanaian distilleries produce alcoholic beverages from cocoa, malt, sugar cane, local medicinal herbs and tree barks. They include bitters, liqueur, dry gins, beer, and aperitifs.\n\nStreet food is very popular in both rural and urban areas of Ghana. Most Ghanaian families eat at least three times a week from street food vendors, from whom all kinds of foods can be bought, including staple foods such as kenkey, red red and waakye. Other savoury foods such as kebab, boiled corn cob, ballfloat (bo-float) and roasted plantain are sold mainly by street food vendors.\n\n\n"}

This 'log' is either left long and straight or is often bent into a horseshoe shape, egg washed, baked, and then sliced crosswise. Nut rolls resemble a jelly roll (Swiss roll) but usually with more layers of dough and filling, and resemble strudels but with fewer and less delicate dough layers. Fillings commonly have as their main ingredient ground walnuts or poppy seeds.\n\nNut rolls can be found in the United States and in Central European cuisines. In the United States, \"nut roll\" is a more or less generic name for pastries of this type, no matter where they originate. Nut rolls are known also by many specific regional names, including: \"orechovník\" in Slovak; \"makowiec\" in Polish; \" potica \", \"povitica\", \"gibanica\", \"orahnjača/orehnjača\" in Slovenian, Croatian and Serbian (walnut variant, \"makovnjača\" for variant with poppy seed, in Croatia can also be made with \"carob\"); \"kalács\" and \"bejgli\" in Hungarian; and \"pastiç\" (pastiche) or \"nokul\" in Turkish.\n\nRegional variations on nut rolls are part of weddings, for Easter and Christmas, as well as other celebrations and holidays.\n\nA sweet yeast dough is rolled flat, about 0.2 inches (5 millimeters) thick, and a filling is spread on it. The filled dough is rolled up, forming a log or loaf shape, then baked. When sliced, the cross-section shows a swirl of filling.\n\nTypes or forms of nut roll are: rolled log, loaf made via a bread pan, and a \"crazy loaf\" style with a unique texture. Similar ground walnut filling is used in Buchteln, a bun-shaped pastry, also with yeast dough.\n\nTraditional nut rolls in Central and Eastern Europe, like makowiec and bejgli, are a special type of rolled log shape. These are generally made with either of two types of filling: walnut and poppy seed. In addition to ground nut fillings, cinnamon, raisins or currants, bread crumbs, lemon zest, rum and heavy cream or sour cream are used. The poppyseed versions are still popular in Russian-American neighborhoods in the USA.\nThe povitica, a traditional Croatian and partly Slovenian pastry, is made from buttery pastry dough rolled into very thin layers and covered with a layer of brown sugar, spices, and walnuts. The log-shaped loaf is then baked.\nPovitica was featured as the technical challenge recipe on the \"Advanced Dough\" episode of The Great British Baking Show in 2014.\nOther roll-shaped European pastries are filled with thick jam (called lekvar, usually apricot or cherry) called lekvarostekercs or Swiss roll.\n\nSlovenian potica is traditional walnut roll cake in Slovenia.\n\nNut roll is also typical for northern Serbia (Vojvodina), where it is named \"štrudla/штрудла\" or \"savijača/савијача\". Serbian nut roll is usually covered with a layer of poppy, walnut or cherry, but sometimes can be with a layer of carob or cocoa.\n\nNut rolls are popular across the United States, often made with some combination of walnut, poppy seed, apricot, and coffee, with more traditional varieties and preparations made in areas with large Central European settlements. They were introduced there by Central European immigrants and widely adopted by other ethnic groups in those regions. Nut rolls are an essential part of Christmas celebrations and popular other times in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania, Joliet, Illinois, Pueblo, Colorado, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Youngstown, Ohio, northeastern Ohio (where it is known as \"kolachi\"), the Iron Range of Minnesota, Kansas City and Butte, Montana. As such, povitica, as well as Cornish pasties, are considered one of the traditional state foods of Montana, regardless of ethnic group.\n\n"}

They are then seasoned with salt and pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat for a few minutes each side, or until golden brown. Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato.\n\nAlternatives include using breadcrumbs or flour instead of cornmeal and frying in vegetable oil or other fat.\n\nThe sliced tomatoes may be dipped in a liquid before the cornmeal is added. This liquid is usually buttermilk or beaten egg; egg results in a slightly firmer texture than buttermilk. Liquids are used because cornmeal does not readily stick to tomato slices. Adding the liquid helps the cornmeal stay in place during the cooking process. It also results in the coating on the tomato becoming thicker and less crunchy when compared to tomatoes cooked without a liquid wash.\n\nWhile fried green tomatoes are usually considered a southern dish they can be found in northern Pennsylvania Dutch homes as well. The northern version is more likely to be made with white flour rather than corn meal. Also, green tomatoes tend to be prepared at the end of the season in the north when the remaining fruit is harvested before the first frosts, whereas green tomatoes are picked throughout the season in the south.\n\nFried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade is a southern and Creole combination served at many restaurants in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nWhile fried green tomatoes have traditionally been a side dish, they are sometimes used in main dishes:\n\n"}

It is also sometimes called Armenian Easter bread.\n\nIt is eaten in Europe, Armenia, Turkey, and other Central Asian countries.\n\nThe Greek word \"tsoureki\" is borrowed from Turkish \"çörek\". Some dictionaries claim that this is derived from the Old Turkish root \"çevir-\" 'turn';\n\nThere are different variations of the Greek \"tsoureki\" holiday breads including a round Christmas loaf with a cross decoration called \"Christopsomo\", a braided easter bread with whole dyed eggs pressed into the dough called \"lampropsomo\", and a loaf with a coin hidden inside for good luck called \"vasilopita\" that is baked for St. Basil's Day (New Year's Day).\n\n\"Tsoureki\" is a Greek holiday bread that is made by Greeks during Easter, not only in Greece, but also in other countries with Greek communities. It is made from a sweet yeast dough of flour, sugar, butter and milk, with dyed red Easter eggs pressed into the dough. The dough is brushed with egg wash before baking, and sometimes flavored with \"mahlep\", mastic resin or orange zest. Other flavorings might include almond extract, cinnamon, sultanas or fennel seed.\n\nThis bread is sometimes called \"Armenian Easter bread\". Traditional Armenian \"cheoreg\" omits the dyed Easter eggs and may be made in smaller sizes, dividing the dough into 10 or 12 portions rather than baking as one whole braided loaf.\n\nThe Turkish language name for this bread is \"paskalya çöreği\" (\"paskalya\" is the Turkish word for Easter). Turkish recipes include egg in the dough, rather than pressed into the dough as decoration. Some recipes substitute a neutral-flavored oil, such as sunflower oil, and margarine in place of milk and butter. The dough may be seasoned with orange zest, vanilla, mahlep and slivered almonds.\n\nSometime tsoureki is used as a gift for special occasion, for instance, it can be given as an Easter gift from children to their godparents.\n\nChristopsomo (Χριστόψωμο), which translates as \"Christ's bread\", is a traditional Greek holiday bread that is sometimes decorated with whole walnuts, sesame seeds and slivered almonds. Also called Christmas fruit bread, the \"tsoureki\" dough may include a combination of raisins, dried apricots, dried figs, orange zest, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cardamom, mastic resin and \"mahleb\". (Some recipes suggest marinating the raisins and dried figs overnight in wines like \"retsina\" or \"mavrodaphne\"). Some of the dough is set aside for the loaf's cross-shaped decoration.\n\nThe bread may be glazed with a syrup made from honey, orange juice and slivered almonds.\n\nThe traditional New Year's cake, Vasilopita (Βασιλόπιτα) is sometimes a tsoureki.\n\n"}
{"id": "4554427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4554427", "title": "Kangaroo meat", "text": "Kangaroo meat\n\nKangaroo meat is mostly produced in Australia from wild animals and in 2010 was exported to over 55 countries worldwide.\n\nCurrently most kangaroo meat is sourced from wild animals as a byproduct of population control programmes. Both the meat and the hides are sold. Although most species of macropod are protected from non-Aboriginal hunting by law, a small number of the large-sized species which exist in high numbers can be hunted by commercial hunters. This policy has been criticised by some animal rights activists. On the other hand, the kangaroo harvest is supported by a wide range of professional ecologists in Australia. Groups such as the Ecological Society of Australia, the Australasian Wildlife Management Society and the Australian Mammal Society have stated their support for kangaroo harvesting. Such groups argue that basing agricultural production systems on native animals rather than introduced livestock like sheep offers considerable ecological advantages to the fragile Australian rangelands and could save greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThough it is impossible to determine the exact number, government conservation agencies in each state calculate population estimates each year. Nearly 40 years of refinement has led to the development of sophisticated aerial survey techniques which enable overall populations estimates to be constructed. Current estimates indicate that there may be between 35 and 50 million kangaroos in Australia. In 2002, the number of kangaroos allowed to be shot by commercial hunters was increased from 5.5 million to 7 million per year. While animal rights activists protested the move, Australian farmers said that kangaroos were a plague after a huge increase in their numbers. A 2002 report studying the grazing pressure caused by kangaroos indicated that scientific evidence is lacking that kangaroos reduce wool production or sheep carrying capacity. In 2007, the national kangaroo culling quota was more than 3.5 million (but significantly down on the figures earlier in the decade).\n\nKangaroos are protected by legislation in Australia, both state and federal. Kangaroos are harvested by licensed shooters in accordance with a strict code of practice. Meat that is exported is inspected by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).\n\nThe quotas created in Australia are the responsibility of each state or territory government. For example, in Queensland, only the following breeds (up to 2017) were included in the quota: red kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, common wallaroo. \"Sustainable use quotas\" are typically between 10–20% of the kangaroo estimated population. Culling is only allowed in certain state areas by approved shooters. Total populations are estimated by aerial surveys and a decade of previous data. Quota numbers calculated by government and science organisations to ensure sustainability. Even though quotas are established by each state, very rarely does actual culling reach 35% of the total quotas allowed. For instance, \"[i]n the 2015 harvest period, 25.9% of the commercial harvest quota (for Queensland) was utilised\". In NSW, private cullers had to \"shoot and let lie\" the carcasses of kangaroos. Drought relief laws have changed this, allowing farmers to produce kangaroo meat.\n\nThe kangaroo has been historically a staple source of protein for indigenous Australians. Kangaroo meat is high in protein and low in fat (about 2%). Kangaroo meat has a very high concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) when compared with other foods. CLA has been attributed with a wide range of health benefits including anti-carcinogenic and anti-diabetes properties, in addition to reducing obesity and atherosclerosis.\n\nWhile Kangaroo meat has enjoyed popularity for its organic nature, little information has been available about its nutrition benefits besides articles dedicated to the value of CLA's. While basic nutritional data (total protein, fats etc.) are published worldwide, little research has been provided about the nature of the kangaroo protein and its composite amino acid profile. Of the 22 amino acids within protein, ten are vital to human and animal well-being because they can't be manufactured in the body. These are called 'essential amino acids' and the primary research on Kangaroo muscle meat nutrition is from a seminal research paper by the primary Australian Government Science organisation CSIRO in 1970.\n\nUsing this research paper as a primary data source Essential Amino acids have been calculated for dried Kangaroo muscle meat (DM) and compared to various other farmed meat sources such as chicken, pork, beef and lamb. By comparison to these farmed meats, Kangaroo meat is higher in Threonine, Isoleucine and Valine and lower in Arginine and Methionine-cystine amino acids. This information is invaluable in calculating balanced diets or when a subject requires an extra natural source of a specific essential amino acid.\n\nKangaroo meat is stronger in flavour than the meat from commercially raised food animals. It is considered to be tender. Minced (or ground) kangaroo meat may be substituted in dishes where minced beef would normally be used.\n\nKangaroo meat was legalised for human consumption in South Australia in 1980, and in all other Australian states in 1993. Kangaroo was once limited in availability, although consumption in Australia is becoming more widespread. However, only 14.5% of Australians were reported in 2008 as eating kangaroo meat at least four times per year. Many Australian supermarkets now stock various cuts of kangaroo including fillets, steaks, minced meat and 'Kanga Bangas' (kangaroo sausages). Many Australian restaurants serve kangaroo meat.\n\nKangaroo meat has been exported since 1959. Seventy percent of kangaroo meat is exported, particularly to the European market: Germany and France. It is sold in two supermarkets in the United Kingdom and before a suspension on imports of kangaroo meat to Russia in 2009 it was widely used in Russian smallgoods. In 2008, the industry is worth around A$250-270 million a year and provides around 4,000 jobs in Australia.\n\nThe meat is also processed into dog food. The small kangaroo farming community is a more environmentally friendly meat industry than sheep or cattle farming since kangaroos require no processed feed, are well-adapted to drought, and do not destroy the root systems of native grasses. However kangaroo farming is economically unattractive due to the start up costs and inability of the farmed product to compete financially against animals that have been killed by hunters under the government quota system.\n\nThe kangaroo meat industry has attracted critical attention in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States from animal welfare organisations. \nThese concerns have centred on the hunting process, in which all kangaroo meat for the global market comes from kangaroos hunted in the wild. Australia's kangaroo hunting programme is the largest annual wildlife hunting programme in the world. A 2009 report from wildlife ecologist Dr Dror Ben-Ami for a University of Technology Sydney think-tank estimated that 440,000 \"dependent young kangaroos\" are bludgeoned or starved to death each year after their mother has been shot. The report also raised serious public health and sustainability concerns.\nDuring the 1990s all British supermarkets agreed to stop selling kangaroo meat, however German retailer Lidl and British supermarket chain Iceland have since introduced kangaroo meat once more.\n\nKangatarianism is a recent practice of following a diet which excludes meat except kangaroo on environmental and ethical grounds. Several Australian newspapers wrote about the neologism \"kangatarianism\" in February 2010, describing eating a vegetarian diet with the addition of kangaroo meat as a choice with environmental benefits because indigenous wild kangaroos require no extra land or water for farming and produce little methane (a greenhouse gas), unlike cattle or other farm animals. Advocates of kangatarianism also choose it because Australian kangaroos live natural lives, eat organic food, and are killed \"humanely\". For similar reasons, Australians have discussed eating only the meat of Australian feral camels (\"cameltarianism\").\n\nThere has been recent discussion from the kangaroo meat industry about attempting to introduce a specific culinary name for kangaroo meat, similar to the reference to pig meat as ham and pork, and calling deer meat venison. The motivation is to have diners thinking of the meat rather than the animal and avoiding adverse reactions to the eating of an animal considered to be cute.\nIn 2005 the \"Food Companion International\" magazine, with support from the Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, ran a competition hoping to find a name that would not put diners off when they saw it on a menu.\nThe three-month competition attracted over 2700 entries from 41 nations, and the name \"australus\" was decided in December 2005. The name was penned by university professor Steven West, an American about to be naturalised as an Australian citizen. Other finalists for the name included kangarly, maroo, krou, maleen, kuja, roujoe, rooviande, jurru, ozru, marsu, kep, kangasaurus, marsupan, jumpmeat, and MOM (meat of marsupials).\n\nThe competition is not binding on the Kangaroo Industry Association, which has not moved to adopt the new name in any official capacity.\n\nKangaroo formed an important part of many traditional Aboriginal diets.\n\nKangaroo is called \"Kere aherre\" by the Arrernte people of Central Australia:\n\nYou find kangaroos in flat country or mulga country. In the old days, people used to sic their dogs on them and spear them. The milk guts are pulled out and a wooden skewer is used to close up the carcase. Then it is tossed on top of the fire to singe the hair which is scraped off, and then it's [put in a hole and] covered up with hot earth and coals. The tail and both feet are cut off before cooking. These are put in together with the rest of the carcase.\n\nThe kangaroo is chopped up so that many people can eat it. The warm blood and fluids from the gluteus medius and the hollow of the thoracic cavity are drained of all fluids. People drink these fluids, which studies have shown are quite harmless. Kangaroos are cut in a special way; into the two thighs, the two hips, the two sides of ribs, the stomach, the head, the tail, the two feet, the back and lower back. This is the way the Arrernte people everywhere cut it up.\n\nThe Anangu, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara peoples of Central Australia call kangaroo \"malu\". They use malu mainly for meat (\"kuka\") but other uses include materials for spear making. They are an important totem species. The Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area Rangers are currently undertaking land management activities to increase this important species in the landscape. This process is named Kuka Kanyini – looking after game animals.\n\n"}

The intestines of suckling lambs are preferred.\n\nThe name \"kokoretsi\" comes from Albanian \"kukurec\".\n\nThe offal, along with some fat, is washed and cut into ½ to ¾-inch thick pieces, and lightly seasoned with lemon, olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sometimes garlic. The intestine are turned inside out and carefully washed, then rubbed with salt and often soaked in vinegar or lemon juice and water.\n\nThe filling meats are threaded onto a long skewer and wrapped with the intestine to hold them together, forming a compact roll usually about 16–24 inches long by 1½–3 inches in diameter.\n\nKokoretsi is usually roasted on a horizontal skewer over a charcoal, gas, or electrical burner, and may be basted with lemon juice and olive oil.\n\nA quite different preparation mixes the chopped innards with chopped tomatoes and green peppers, and then cooks them on a large griddle with hot red pepper and oregano added. The cook constantly mixes and chops the mixture using two spatulas. When done, the dish is kept warm aside on the griddle until someone orders a serving.\n\nThe cooked kokoretsi is chopped or sliced, sprinkled with oregano, and served on a plate. Sometimes it is served on a piece of flatbread. Some add tomatoes or spices in it. It may also (especially in Turkey) be served in half a baguette or in a sandwich bun, plain or garnished, almost always with oregano and red pepper. In Turkey, common side dishes are pickled peppers or cucumbers. It is often seasoned with lemon, oregano, salt, a pepper, and typically accompanied by wine or raki.\n\nKokoretsi is typically available in restaurants, ouzeris and tavernas year round in Greece, but for the most part it remains a festival dish ordinarily prepared only once a year at home during Orthodox Easter celebrations when it is traditional for Greek families to spit-roast a whole lamb. It serves as a \"meze\" or appetizer until the lamb is ready.\n\nDue to outbreak of mad cow disease in the late '90s, banning the consumption of offal was considered. However, the idea was abandoned.\n\nGardouba (γαρδούμπα) or gardoubakia (γαρδουμπάκια) is a smaller variant of kokoretsi; it may be grilled like kokoretsi, or roasted in a pan.

Jewellery created in this style has important cultural significance in Indian religions of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.\n\nThe ancient origin of the Nine Gems—called \"Navaratna\" in Sanskrit, Hindi, Nepali, Kannada, Burmese, and Indonesian, \"Navarathinam\" in Tamil, \"Navarathnalu\" in Telugu, \"Navarathnam\" in Malayalam, \"Navaratna\" in Singhalese, \"Nawaratna\" in Malay, and \"Nawarat\" or \"Noppharat\" in Thai—has proved impossible to trace. Yet such importance is given to this combination of nine gems that they are recognised as sacred and royal in almost all the countries of Asia, including, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, regardless of religious and cultural differences.\n\nIn Thailand, the Navaratna is officially recognised as a national and royal symbol of the king. A high award given by the king is called \"Noppharat Ratchawaraphon\" (the Ancient Auspicious Order of the Nine Gems).\nThe decoration consists of a single class (Knight). The insignia is:\n\nLate Thai astrologer \"Horacharn\" Thep Sarikabutr has given the meaning of these nine gems in his \"Parichad-Jataka\" (chapter 2, verse 21, page 35–36) translated as follows:\n\"\"Top quality and flawless ruby is the gem for the Sun, natural pearl for the Moon, red coral for Mars, emerald for Mercury yellow sapphire for Jupiter, diamond for Venus, blue sapphire for Saturn, hessonite for Rahu (ascending lunar node), and cat's eye for Ketu (descending lunar node).\"\"\n\nThis quote attributed to the Sanskrit \"Brihat Jatak\" is also quoted in the \"Mani-mala\" page 575, verse 79 by S.M. Tagore (1879), and also in the ancient \"Jataka Parijata,\" chapter 2, sloka 21 compiled by Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshitar,\nand reads in Sanskrit transliterated as follows:\nTranslation:\n\"...these gems must be high-born and flawless.\"\n\nThe traditional setting and arrangement of these nine gems is shown in the illustration. A ruby (representing the Sun) is always in the center, surrounded (clockwise from the top) by a diamond, a natural pearl, red coral, hessonite, a blue sapphire, cat's eye, a yellow sapphire, and an emerald. This is the same placement as the Nava-graha Yantra.\n\nTraditionally, no gem other than a ruby or a red spinel is set in the center of a nine gems arrangement. To do so is believed to go against the flow of nature. Because the Sun is the center of the solar system, its gem is positioned in the heart of a Navaratna Talisman.\n\nFor an example of the navaratna in a necklace setting, see Thailand's \"The Queen Sirikit Navaratna.\"\n\nIn the above \"sloka\" the words \"sujatyam-amalam\" (\"sujati\"=high born, and \"amala\"=completely pure or flawless) are significant. According to Asian belief systems, only clean, top-quality gems are considered to be auspicious.\n\nIn further support of this mostly overlooked dictate, in the Hindu \"\"Garuda Puranam\",\" chapter 68, verse 17, it is stated by narrator Sri Suta Goswami:\n\" \"Pure, flawless gems have auspicious powers which can protect one from demons, snakes, poisons, diseases, sinful reactions, and other dangers, while flawed stones have the opposite effect\".\"\n\nAnd from the ancient \" \"Agni Purana\",\" chapter 246, \"slokas\" 7 and 8:\n\"\"A gem free from all impurities and radiating its characteristic internal luster should be looked upon as an escort of good luck; a gem which is cracked, fissured, devoid of luster, or appearing rough or sandy, should not be used at all\".\"\n\n\"Just as a house can be fitted with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily temple can be benefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discovered that pure metals emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive to negative pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations are constantly circulating in the universe [...] This problem received attention from our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but also of plants and most effective of all faultless jewels of not less than two carats. The preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied outside of India. One little-known fact is that the proper jewels, metals, or plant preparations are valueless unless the required weight is secured, and unless these remedial agents are worn next to the skin.\"\n\nAccording to Hindu astrology, life on earth is influenced by the \"navagrahas\", or nine influencers. The placement of the \"navagrahas\" in one's horoscope supposedly have an influence throughout an individual's life. Wearing the nine gems is said to provide an astrological balance and benefit to the wearer. Hindu astrology also says that these gems potentially may have both positive or negative influences on human life, and that astrological gems should be worn only after consulting a Vedic astrologer, who is also conversant with gems. Based on an individual's sidereal horoscope, either a single gem or a combination of compatible gems is advised to be worn to harness beneficial planets or counteract harmful planets. The supposed \"astrological\" or \"piezoelectric\" benefit of wearing or donating gems has not been scientifically quantified.\n\n\n"}

Silverskin onions are pickled in white vinegar, and are much smaller. Full sized onions, e.g. Spanish Onions, can be pickled if sliced first.\n\nIn the Southern United States, pickled Vidalia onions can be served as a side dish.\n\nIn Hong Kong, pickled onions are served in many Cantonese restaurants, especially around dinner time, as a small dish before the main course is served.\n\nIn Switzerland, they are served to accompany raclette, along with pickled gherkins.\n\nIn Italy, it is known as 'maggiolina'.\n\nIn Mexican cuisine, one preparation, cebollas encurtidas, has sliced red onions pickled in a mixture of citrus juices and vinegar, which is served as a garnish or condiment. Sometimes cooked beets are added, producing a more strongly pink coloured dish. Pickled red onions in bitter orange juice are especially emblematic of Yucatan cuisine, where they are used as a garnish or condiment, especially for seafood.\n\n"}

Basic corn chowder ingredients comprise corn, onion, celery, milk or cream and butter. Additional ingredients sometimes used include potatoes, salt pork, fish, seafood and chicken. In the United States, recipes for corn chowder date to at least as early as 1884. Corn chowder is mass-produced as a canned food in the U.S.\n\nCorn chowder is a thick cream-based soup or chowder. It is similar to New England clam chowder, with corn used in place of or substituted for clams in the recipe. Basic ingredients in corn chowder include corn, chopped onion and celery, milk or cream, butter, flour, salt and pepper. Fresh shucked corn with the corn kernels sliced off, canned corn and frozen corn can be used to prepare the dish. In addition to corn, it often contains potatoes, and additional vegetables can also be used. The potatoes can aid in thickening the soup. Chicken stock can also be used as an ingredient, as can salt pork, bacon, crackers and corn starch, the latter as a thickener.\n\nCorn cobs can be used as an ingredient when preparing fresh stock for the dish, and cooking them down can also serve to thicken the soup. Various fish and seafoods are sometimes used as ingredients in corn chowder, and chicken is also sometimes used. Some people serve basic corn chowder as a vegetarian alternative to clam chowder.\n\nIn the United States, recipes for corn chowder date back to at least 1884, at which time a corn chowder recipe was published in the \"Boston Cook Book\", authored by Mary Lincoln of the Boston Cooking School. Another corn chowder recipe was published in the \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\" in 1896, which was authored by Fannie Farmer, Lincoln's successor at the Boston Cooking School. Farmer's recipe utilized canned corn, a product that emerged around the mid-1800s in the U.S. The 1896 recipe also included salt pork, potatoes and crackers as ingredients. After Lincoln's published recipe in 1884, myriad recipes for corn chowder began circulating in various cookbooks in the United States, with many types of recipe variations. For example, some recipes utilized cream, milk or condensed milk, and thickeners included the use of flour or eggs.\n\nAround the early 1900s, the Shakers were well-known for their chowder soups and general culinary skills. A simple Shakers recipe from this time period for corn chowder used just three ingredients: cream, butter and fresh corn.\n\nCorn chowder is a mass-produced canned food product in the United States. The Campbell Soup Company manufactures and markets prepared canned soup products named \"Sweet Potato Corn Chowder\", \"Campbell's Healthy Request Chunky Corn Chowder\", \"Campbell's Chunky Chicken Corn Chowder\" and \"Clam and Corn Chowder with Bacon.\"\n\nProgresso, a General Mills brand, manufactures and markets corn chowders, such as \"Rich & Hearty Chicken Corn Chowder\" and \"Light Chicken Corn Chowder.\"\n\nCostco markets a corn chowder under its Kirkland Signature brand name, named \"Kirkland Roasted Corn Chowder.\"\n\nSafeway Inc. markets a corn chowder under their \"Signature Cafe\" store brand.\n"}
{"id": "4579515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4579515", "title": "Tarhana", "text": "Tarhana\n\nTarhana or trahana is dried food ingredient based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and Middle East. Dry tarhana has a texture of coarse, uneven crumbs, and it is usually made into a thick soup with water, stock, or milk. As it is both acidic and low in moisture the milk proteins keep for long periods. Tarhana is very similar to some kinds of kishk.\n\nThe Armenian \"tarkhana\" is made up of matzoon and eggs mixed with half of wheat flour and half of starch. Small pieces of dough are prepared and dried and then kept in glass containers and uses mostly dry soups, dissolving in hot liquids. The Greek \"trahana\" contains only cracked wheat or a \"couscous\"-like paste and fermented milk. The Turkish \"tarhana\" consists of cracked wheat (or flour), yoghurt, and vegetables fermented then dried. In Cyprus, it is considered a national specialty, and is often served with pieces of haloumi cheese in it. In Albania it is prepared with wheat, yoghurt and butter and it is served with hot olive oil and feta cheese.\n\nHill and Bryer suggest that tarhana is related to Greek τρακτόν (\"trakton\", romanized as \"tractum\"), a thickener Apicius wrote about in the 1st century CE which most other authors consider to be a sort of cracker crumb. Dalby (1996) connects it to the Greek τραγός/τραγανός (\"tragos\"/\"traganos\"), described (and condemned) in Galen's \"Geoponica\" 3.8. Weaver (2002) also considers it of Western origin.\n\nPerry, on the other hand, considers that the phonetic evolution of τραγανός to \"tarhana\" is unlikely, and that it probably comes from \"tarkhwāneh\". He considers the resemblance to τραγανός and to τραχύς 'coarse' coincidental, though he speculates that τραχύς may have influenced the word by folk etymology.\n\nIn Persian language sources, al-Zamakhshari mentioned the name of this food in the 11th century in the form \"tarkhana\" in his dictionary; it is attested in the 13th century in the form \"tarkhina\" in the \"Jahangiri Encyclopedia\" (named after Jahangir, the Mughal emperor of India). \"Tar\" تر in Persian means 'wet, soaked', and \"khwān\" خوان (pronounced \"khān\") means 'dining place/table, food, large wooden bowl'. Thus in Persian it would mean 'watered or soaked food', which matches the way the soup is made: tarhana must be soaked in water, and other possible ingredients are then added and cooked for some time.\n\nRegional variations of the name include (Armenian թարխանա; Greek τραχανάς \"trahanas\" or (ξυνό)χονδρος \"(xyno)hondros\"; Persian ترخینه، ترخانه، ترخوانه \"tarkhineh, tarkhāneh, tarkhwāneh\"; Kurdish) \"tarxane\" , Albanian \"trahana\", Bulgarian \"трахана\" or \"тархана', Serbo-Croatian \"tarana\" or \"trahana\"; or Turkish \"tarhana\". \n\nTarhana is made by mixing flour, yoghurt or sour milk, and optionally cooked vegetables, salt, groats, and spices (notably tarhana herb), letting the mixture ferment, then drying, and usually grinding and sieving the result. The fermentation produces lactic acid and other compounds giving tarhana its characteristic sour taste and good keeping properties: the pH is lowered to 3.4-4.2, and the drying step reduces the moisture content to 6-10%, resulting in a medium inhospitable to pathogens and spoilage organisms, while preserving the milk proteins.\n\nTarhana are cooked as a thick soup by adding them to stock, water, or milk and simmering. In Albania it is made with wheat flour and yoghurt into small pasta-like chunks which are dried and crushed; the powder is used to cook a soup which is served with bread cubes. In Cyprus it is common to add cubes of Halloumi cheese towards the end of cooking.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4581437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4581437", "title": "Chametz", "text": "Chametz\n\nChametz (also \"chometz\", \"\", \"ḥameṣ\", \"ḥameç\" and other spellings transliterated from , ) are leavened foods that are forbidden on the Jewish holiday of Passover. According to halakha, Jews may not own, eat or benefit from \"chametz\" during Passover. This law appears several times in the Torah; the punishment for eating \"chametz\" on Passover is the divine punishment of \"kareth\" (\"spiritual excision\").\n\n\"Chametz\" is a product that is both made from one of five types of grain and has been combined with water and left to stand raw for longer than eighteen minutes and becomes leavened.\n\nThe adjective \"chametz\" is derived from the common Semitic root \"Ḥ\"-\"M\"-\"Ṣ\", relating to bread, leavening, and baking. The related noun \"chimutz\" is the process of leavening or fermenting. It is cognate to the Aramaic , \"to ferment, leaven\" and the Arabic \"ḥameḍ\", \"to be sour\", \"to become acidic\".\n\nThe Torah has several commandments governing \"chametz\" during Passover:\n\nThe prohibitions take effect around late morning on the eve of Passover, or the 14th of the month of Nisan, in the Jewish calendar. \"Chametz\" is permitted again from nightfall after the final day of Passover, which is the 21st day of the month and the last of the seven days of Unleavened Bread (). Traditional Jewish homes spend the days leading up to Passover cleaning and removing all traces of \"chametz\" from the house.\n\nAll fruits, grains, and grasses for example naturally adhere wild yeasts and other microorganisms. This is the basis of all historic fermentation processes in human culture that were utilized for the production of beer, wine, bread and silage, amongst others. \n\"Chametz\" from the five grains is the result of a natural microbial enzymatic activity which is caused by exposing grain starch—which has not been sterilized, i.e. by baking—to water. This causes the dissolved starch to ferment and break down into sugars which then become nutrients to the naturally contained yeasts. A typical side effect of this biological leavening is the growth of the naturally-adhering yeasts in the mixture which produce gaseous carbon dioxide from glycolysis which causes the fermented dough to rise and become increasingly acidic.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, \"chametz\" can only consist of grains of two varieties of wheat and three varieties of barley which begin to rise when exposed to water. The Talmud—the Jerusalem Talmud in regard to the Land of Israel and the Babylonian Talmud in regard to the Persian Empire—lists the following five grain varieties as the only ones which do so: , , , , and . After that the Talmud groups them into two varieties of wheat ( , ) and three varieties of barley ( , , and . Since European medieval times, the following translations are widely accepted in Orthodox Jewry: -wheat, -spelt, -barley, -oats, and -rye. The latter types of grain, oats and rye, normally are not cultivated in the hot, dry subtropical climate, but in the colder, wetter temperate climate. \n\nAccording to Jewish law, only the five grains are suitable for the production of \"matzo\" (unleavened bread).\n\nWhile oats are still generally accepted as the fifth grain since times of medieval European Jewry, modern research suggests that what has been traditionally translated as \"oats\" is in fact a wild species of barley (\"Hordeum\"), or other grains. Although there have been no changes to normative Jewish law to reflect this, some rabbis take a stringent view and discourage the use of oat \"matzo\" to fulfil the biblical obligation of eating \"matzo\" at the Passover Seder.\n\nOther than the traditional translation, some researchers today propose that only the grain species native to the Land of Israel can become \"chametz\", which would rule rye (\"Secale\") out because it grows in colder, wetter climates. They offer other translations to the 5 grains. However, just as before, this research has had no effect on normative Judaism, which continues to accept the traditional translation.\n\nAccording to the Jerusalem Talmud (Pesachim 1:1), when any other cultivated grain from the mediterranean climate regions (of Israel or Iraq) is exposed to water it begins to decay or rot; this process is not \"chimutz\", but \"sirachon\".\n\nLeavening agents, such as yeast or baking soda, are not themselves \"chametz\". Rather, it is the fermented grains. Thus yeast may be used in making wine. Similarly, baking soda may be used in Passover baked goods made with matzoh meal and in matzoh balls. Since the matzoh meal used in those foods is already baked, the grain will not ferment. Whether a chemical leavener such as baking soda may be used with flour in making egg matzoh is disputed among contemporary Sephardic authorities. In accordance with those who permit it, cookies made with Passover flour, wine and a chemical leavener (the absence of water would make them similar to egg matzoh under the \"chametz\" rules) are marketed in Israel under the name \"wine cookies\" to Sephardim and others who eat egg matzoh on Passover.\n\nThe Torah specifies the punishment of \"karet\" (spiritual excision) for eating \"chametz\", one of the highest levels of punishment in Jewish tradition. During Passover, eating \"chametz\" is prohibited no matter how small a proportion it is in a mixture although the usual rule is that if less than 1/60 of a mixture is not kosher, the mixture is permitted. If the dilution happened before Pesach, the usual 1/60 rule applies; however, Ashkenazi Jews apply this leniency only if the mixture is liquid.\n\nAlso, \"hana'ah\" (any benefit, such as selling) from some forms of non-kosher food is permitted, but no form of benefit may be derived from \"chametz\" during Passover. Mixtures containing less than 50% \"chametz\" and not eaten by normal people (medicine or pet food, even if it is perfectly edible) may be owned and used on Passover but may not be eaten.\n\nIn addition to the Biblical prohibition of owning \"chametz\", there is also a positive commandment to remove it from one's possession. There are three traditional methods of removing \"chametz\":\n\nIt is considered best to use both \"bi'ur\" and \"bittul\" to remove one's \"chametz\" even though either of these two methods is enough to fulfill one's biblical requirement to destroy it. \"Mechirah\", which averts the prohibition of ownership, is an alternative to destruction.\n\nIn many Jewish communities, the rabbi signs a contract with each congregant, assigning the rabbi as an agent to sell their \"chametz\". The practice is convenient for the congregation and ensures that the sale is binding by both Jewish and local law.\n\nFor \"chametz\" owned by the State of Israel, which includes its state companies, the prison service and the country's stock of emergency supplies, the Chief Rabbinate act as agent; since 1997, the Rabbinate has sold its \"chametz\" to Jaaber Hussein, a hotel manager residing in Abu Ghosh, who puts down a deposit of 20,000 shekels for \"chametz\" worth an estimated $150 million.\n\nAccording to Halakha, if \"chametz\" is found during Shabbat or Yom Tov, it must be covered over until Chol HaMoed, when it can be burned. \"Chametz\" found during Chol HaMoed (except on Shabbat) should be burned immediately.\n\nAfter the holiday, there is a special law known as \"chametz she'avar alav haPesach\" (\"chametz\" that was owned by a Jew during Pesach). Such \"chametz\" must be burned, since no benefit is allowed to be derived from it, not even by selling it to a non-Jew. \"Chametz she'avar alav haPesach\" may not be eaten by Jews after Pesach. If a store owned by a Jew is known not to have sold its \"chametz\", a Jew may not buy any from that store until enough time has passed in which it can be assumed that the inventory has changed over since Pesach.\n\nBecause of the Torah's severity regarding the prohibition of \"chametz\", many communities have adopted stringencies not biblically required as safeguards from inadvertent transgression.\n\nAmong Ashkenazi Jews, the custom during Passover is to refrain not only from products of the five grains but also \"kitniyot\" \n(literally: \"small things\"), which refers to other grains or legumes. Traditions of what is considered \"kitniyot\" vary from community to community but generally include rice, maize (corn), lentils and beans. Many include peanuts as well.\n\nTwo common theories for this custom are that those products are often made into products resembling \"chametz\" (such as cornbread) or that they were normally stored in the same sacks as the five grains and so people worried that they might become contaminated with \"chametz\". The most common explanation, however, has to do with the Talmudic concept of marit ayin (\"how it appears to the eye\"). While not against the laws of passover to consume \"kitniyot\", a person eating them might be mistakenly assumed by others to be consuming \"chametz\" against the law, or the observer might erroneously conclude that \"chametz\" was permitted. To avoid confusion, they were simply banned outright.\n\nAlthough \"kitniyot\" cannot conceivably become \"chametz\", there are authorities such as the Vilna Gaon who are concerned that kitniyot might, in some way, become confused with true chametz. Firstly, cooked porridge and other cooked dishes made from grain and \"kitniyot\" appear similar. Secondly, \"kitniyot\" are often grown in fields adjacent to those in which \"chametz\" is grown, and these grains tend to mix. Thirdly, \"kitniyot\" are often ground into a type of flour that can easily be confused with \"chametz\". For these reasons, those authorities suggested that by avoiding eating \"kitniyot\", people would be better able to avoid \"chametz\".\n\nWhile the practice is considered binding in normative Ashkenazi Judaism, these items are not \"chametz\" and therefore are not subject to the same prohibitions and stringencies. For example, while there is a prohibition against owning \"chametz\" on Passover, no such prohibition applies to \"kitniyot\". Similarly, while someone would not be permitted to eat \"chametz\" on Passover unless his life were in danger since it is a Torah prohibition, \"kitniyot\" is prohibited merely by the Rabbis, and so people who are infirm or pregnant may be allowed to eat \"kitniyot\", on consultation with a rabbi. Furthermore, \"kitniyot\" is considered \"nullified in a majority\" so Ashkenazi Jews may eat food containing less than 50% \"kitniyot\" as long as the kitniyot are not distinguishable within the food, and the food was not prepared to take advantage of such a \"loophole\". However, many Ashkenazi Jews today hold to a standard not to eat food containing any \"kitniyot\".\n\nThere is some movement among Conservative Ashkenazi Jews to cease to observe the tradition of \"kitniyot\".\n\nSephardi Jews have no general restrictions. Some Sephardi Jews from Spain and North Africa (for example, Moroccan Jews) have different restrictions, such as avoiding rice during Pesach.\n\nAt Passover, some Hasidic Jews will not eat \"matzo\" that has become wet, including matzo balls and other matzo meal products although it cannot become \"chametz\". Such products are called \"gebrochts\" (Yiddish: \"broken\"), referring to the broken or ground matzo used for baking or cooking. Instead of matzo meal, they use potato starch in cakes and other dishes. The Hebrew term for gebrochts is \"matzo sh'ruyah\" (soaked matzo), but outside Israel, the Yiddish name is usually the one that is used.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4593785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4593785", "title": "Clinical engineering", "text": "Clinical engineering\n\nClinical engineering is a speciality within HTM (Healthcare Technology Management) biomedical engineering responsible primarily for applying and implementing medical technology to optimize healthcare delivery. Roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs), working with governmental regulators on hospital inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (i.e. physicians, administrators, IT, etc.). Clinical engineers also advise medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression of the state-of-the-art in order to redirect hospital procurement patterns accordingly.\n\nTheir inherent focus on \"practical\" implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards \"incremental\"-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to \"revolutionary\" R&D or cutting-edge ideas that would be many years from clinical adoptability; however, there is an effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a sort of \"bridge\" between product originators and end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both close to the point-of-use, while also trained in product and process design. Clinical engineering departments at large hospitals will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also IT, industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research, human factors, cost analyses, safety, etc.\n\nWhile some trace its roots back to the 1940s, the actual term \"clinical engineering\" was first used in 1969. The first explicit published reference to the term appears in a paper published in 1969 by Landoll and Caceres. Cesar A. Caceres, a cardiologist, is generally credited with coining the term \"clinical engineering\". Of course, the broader field of biomedical engineering has a relatively recent history as well. The first modern professional intersociety engineering meeting to be focused on the application of engineering in medicine was probably held in 1948, according to the Alliance for Engineering in Medicine and Biology.\n\nThe general notion of the application of engineering to medicine can be traced back centuries; for example, Stephen Hales's work in the early 18th century which led to the invention of a ventilator and the discovery of blood pressure certainly involved the application of engineering techniques to medicine.\n\nThe recent history of this sub-discipline is somewhat erratic. In the early 1970s, clinical engineering was thought to be a field that would require many new professionals. Estimates for the US ranged as high as 5,000 to 8,000 clinical engineers, or five to ten clinical engineers for every 250,000 of population, or one clinical engineer per 250 hospital beds.\n\nThe history of its formal credentialization and accreditation procedures has also been somewhat unstable. The International Certification Commission for Clinical Engineers (ICC) was formed under the sponsorship of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) in the early 1970s, to provide a formal certification process for clinical engineers. A similar certification program was formed by academic institutions offering graduate degrees in clinical engineering as the American Board of Clinical Engineering (ABCE). In 1979, the ABCE agreed to dissolve, and those certified under its program were accepted into the ICC certification program. By 1985, only 350 clinical engineers had become certified. Finally, in 1999, the AAMI after lengthy deliberation, and analysis of a 1998 survey demonstrating that there was not a viable market for its certification program decided to suspend that program, no longer accepting any new applicants as of July 1999.\n\nThe new, current clinical engineering certification (CCE) program was started in 2002 under the sponsorship of the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), and is administered by the ACCE Healthcare Technology Foundation. In 2004, the first year that the certification process was actually underway, 112 individuals were granted certification based upon their previous ICC certification, and three individuals were awarded the new certification. By the time of the publication of the 2006-2007 AHTF Annual Report (c. June 30, 2007), a total of 147 individuals were included in the ranks of HTF certified clinical engineers.\n\nIn 2011, AAMI arranged a meeting to discuss a new name for clinical engineering and/or biomedical equipment technology. After careful debate, the vast majority decided on \"Healthcare Technology Management\". Due partly to common confusion about the line between clinical engineers (engineers) and BMETs (technicians), the word \"engineering\" was deemed limiting from the administrator's perspective and unworkable from the educator's perspective. (An ABET-accredited college could not name an associate degree program \"engineering\".) Also, the adjective \"clinical\" limited the scope to hospitals. It remains unresolved how widely or officially accepted this change is or will be, and how this will affect Clinical Engineering Certification (CCE) or the formal recognition of clinical engineering as a subset of biomedical engineering. For regulatory and licensure reasons true engineering specialities must be definable in a way that distinguishes them from technicians with whom they work.\n\nA clinical engineer is defined by the ACCE as \"a professional who supports and advances patient care by applying engineering and managerial skills to healthcare technology.\" This definition was first adopted by the ACCE Board of Directors on May 13, 1991. Clinical engineering is also recognized by the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the major professional organization for biomedical engineering, as being a branch within biomedical engineering. \n\nThere are at least two issues with the ACCE definition that cause some confusion. First, it is phrased so broadly that it's not readily evident that \"clinical engineer\" is a subset of \"biomedical engineer\". Many times the terms are used interchangeably: some hospitals refer to their relevant departments as \"Clinical Engineering\" departments, while others call them \"Biomedical Engineering\" departments. Indeed, as noted above, the \"technicians\" are almost universally referred to as \"biomedical equipment technicians,\" regardless of the name of the department that they might work under. However, the term \"biomedical engineer\" is generally thought to be more all-encompassing, including engineers who work in the primary design of medical devices for manufacturers, or in original R&D, or in academia—whereas clinical engineers generally work in hospitals solving problems that are very close to where equipment is actually used in a patient care setting. The clinical engineers in some countries such as India are trained to innovate and find technological solutions for the clinical needs. The other issue not evident from the ACCE definition is the appropriate educational background for a clinical engineer. Generally, the expectation of the certification program is that an applicant for certification as a clinical engineer will hold an accredited bachelor's degree in engineering (or at least engineering technology).\n\nThe management of healthcare technology is becoming increasingly complex.\n\nThe University of Connecticut offers a two-year clinical engineering internship program where students work part-time as clinical engineers during the Fall and Spring semester at a hospital in New England. Clinical engineering classes are attended throughout the academic semesters in core and trending topics of the clinical engineering field.\n\nThe University of Toronto offers a two-year master of health sciences in clinical engineering program where students complete internships as clinical engineers in industry or at hospitals. In addition to internships, students are required to complete a research thesis. Clinical engineering classes are attended throughout the first year of the program in core and trending topics within the clinical engineering field.\n\nTo be eligible for certification in clinical engineering (CCE), a candidate must hold appropriate professional or educational credentials (an accredited engineering or engineering-technology degree) have certain relevant experience and pass an examination. The Examination for Certification in Clinical Engineering involves a written examination composed of a maximum of 150 multiple-choice objective questions with a testing time of three hours, and a separate oral exam. Particular weight is given to applicants for CE certification (CCE) who are already licensed as registered Professional Engineers (PE), which itself has extensive requirements (including an accredited engineering degree and engineering experience).\n\nClinical engineers in the UK typically work within the NHS. Clinical engineering is a modality of the clinical scientist profession, registered by the HCPC. The responsibilities of clinical engineers are varied, and can include providing specialist clinical services, inventing and developing medical devices, and medical device management. The roles typically involve both patient contact and academic research. Clinical engineering units within an NHS organisation are often part of a larger medical physics department. Clinical engineers, are supported and represented by the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM), within which the clinical engineering special interest group oversees the engineering activities. The three primary aims of Clinical Engineering with the NHS are:\n\nClinical engineering supports a broad range of healthcare activities, and therefore the specific person requirements for the role are equally varied. However clinical scientist must be able to work with patients, clinical staff and a range of other professionals, therefore being able to communicate often in complex situations appropriately is essential. As a scientist you will be required to keep up to date with advances in your area, and will often have the opportunity to communicate research and development to others. Clinical engineers will have a scientific first degree (often engineering or physics) before going on to train and register as a clinical scientist., and many also are educated to a doctoral level, either as part of their clinical engineering training, or prior to training.\n\nClinical engineers are registered as clinical scientists by the HCPC. Assessment of trainees prior to registration is provided by the Association of Clinical Scientists (ACS) and the Academy of Healthcare Science (AHCS). There are two programmes for attaining registration from the HCPC as a clinical scientist. The first is a Certificate of Attainment, awarded on successful completion of the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP), and the second is through the Certificate of Equivalence, awarded on successful demonstration of equivalence to the STP. This second route is normally chosen by individuals that have significant scientific experience prior to seeking registration. In March 2017 IPEM published a policy document stating their position on the routes of entry to clinical scientist registration.\n\nHealthcare has increasingly become technology driven and requires trained manpower to keep pace with the growing demand for professionals in the field. An M-Tech Clinical Engineering course was initiated by Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM), Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum and Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC), to address the country's need of human resource development. This was aimed at indigenous biomedical device development as well as technology management, and thereby contribute to the overall development of healthcare delivery in the country.\n\nDuring the course, students of engineering are given an insight into biology, medicine, relevant electronic background, clinical practices, device development and even management aspects. Additionally, students are paired with clinical doctors from CMC and SCTIMST to get hands-on experience during internships. An important aspect of this training is simultaneous, long term and detailed exposure to clinical environment as well as to medical device development activity. This is aimed at making students understand the process of identifying unmet clinical needs and thus, contributing to the development of new medical devices in the country. A unique feature of the course is clinical attachment which exposes the students to the clinical environment. The program also trains engineers to manage and ensure safe and effective use of technology in health care delivery points.\n\nThe minimum qualification for joining this course is a bachelor's degree in any discipline of engineering except civil engineering and a valid GATE score in that field.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a widely available inexpensive treat and a favoured gift for families, friends and relatives.\n\nIn Indonesia, it is also widely known as Bakpia Pathok, named after a suburb of Yogyakarta which specialises in the pastry. These sweet rolls are similar to bigger Indonesian \"pia\", the only difference being the size.\n\nThe flaky type of \"bakpia\" uses Chinese puff pastry. Clear examples of this can be seen in China (especially Macau), Taiwan and countries with established Chinese diaspora communities such as Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana making this type the authentic Chinese \"hopia\". In addition, there is more skill involved in making this type of \"hopia\" crust.\n\nThe cake-dough type uses a soft cookie-dough similar in texture & taste to the wrapper-dough for fig newtons. This type is very similar to Japanese bean cakes, which grants it the name \"hopyang Hapon\" (Japanese bean cake in Filipino).\n\nBelow are the four traditional and most popular \"bakpia\" fillings, though recently other fillings have been created such as cappuccino, cheese, chocolate, custard, durian, mango, pineapple and screwpine (pandan).\n\nThe most popular flaky \"bakpia\" both in Indonesia and the Philippines is mung bean \"bakpia\" (Indonesian: \"bakpia kacang hijau\"; Tagalog and Visayan: \"hopyang munggo\"), sometimes referred to as \"hopyang matamís\" (\"sweet \"hopia\"\" in Tagalog). As its name implies, it is filled with sweet split mung bean paste.\n\n\"Hopyang baboy\" (Tagalog and Visayan for \"pork \"hopia\"\") is filled with a savoury bread-crumb paste studded with candied wintermelon, flavoured with scallion and enriched with candied pork back fat, hence its name. This type of \"hopia\" is also sometimes referred to as \"hopyang maalat\" (Tagalog for \"salty \"hopia\"\").\n\n\"Ube hopia\" or \"hopyang ube\" is a variant of hopia from the Philippines which use purple yam (Visayan and Tagalog: \"ube/ubi\"). The filling is reminiscent of \"halayáng ube\" (ube jam), a traditional Filipino dessert eaten during Christmas season. Like other ube-based dishes, it has a unique, vivid violet colour and sweet taste.\n\n\"Ube hopia\" was first introduced in the 1980s by Gerry Chua of Eng Bee Tin, a Chinese Filipino deli chain in the Binondo district of Manila noted for their fusion of Chinese and Filipino culinary traditions.\n\nAzuki-bean \"hopia\" are small, round cake-dough type \"hopia\" usually filled with sweet azuki bean paste, similar in appearance to small mooncakes served during the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. These are also often formed into cubes and cooked on a griddle one side at a time instead of being baked in an oven. Due to its similarities in filling, crust texture, and style to the Japanese \"kuri manjū\", it earned the popular moniker \"hopyang Hapón\" (Filipino for \"Japanese \"hopia\"\").\n"}

Fake moustaches are made in different ways, but usually require the wearer to use adhesive to affix the moustache to his or her face. Some have a self-adhesive backing. National fake moustache day in the United States is on 24 February, while the international celebration is on 3 February.\n\nThe most notable fake moustache of all-time was probably worn by Charlie Chaplin for his role as The Tramp. He initially wore it as a means of disguising his youth for the role.\n\nGroucho Marx also used a fake moustache during his years in vaudeville and in the early Marx Brothers movies. However, his was drawn onto his lip with grease paint, containing no hairs or bristles. In later life he grew his own, real moustache. It, along with his cigar and waggling eyebrows, were his famous trademark.\n\nIn Dayton, Ohio, there is a group who gathers to celebrate the hoy of the fake moustache. The Gem City Fake Mustache Society meets monthly for various events, some events include 5K races, Dayton Bombers games or local parades.\n\nKansas City has been said to have the premiere fake moustache club in North America.

{"id": "4611277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4611277", "title": "Indoor netball", "text": "Indoor netball\n\nIndoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, reducing the number of playing stoppages. This gives indoor netball a faster pace than netball.\n\nThere are two main types of indoor netball, \"6-a-side\" and \"7-a-side\". Indoor netball has a larger focus towards mixed-gender matches than netball does, although ladies' games, and to a smaller extent men's games, are ever-present. While the sport does not have as large a following as netball does, its popularity is growing in countries such as England, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The sport is administered at an international level by the World Indoor Netball Association (WINA).\n\nThe rules of indoor netball are similar to that of netball, with two teams aiming to score as many goals as possible. An indoor netball game usually consists of four quarters of 10 minutes. There are two umpires one for each half of the court. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the match. In case of a tie in elimination games, two straight 5-minute overtimes are played; if still tied, whoever is up two points will win.\n\nIn this version the court is divided into halves rather than thirds, and there are six players per team rather than seven. The team is made up of two centre players, two attack players, and two defence players. The two attack players are located in one half and the two defence in the other with the centre players running the full court excluding the circles. Scoring is also different, with a successful shot inside the circle scoring 1 point and outside the circle scoring 2 points (much like 3-pointers in basketball). Because of the 2-point line this changes the game play significantly, with the attack players working to set up the centre players for the 2-point shot. Once a goal is scored, a defence player from the opposition team takes a throw-off from the top of their circle. This makes the game even faster as the ball doesn't have to be sent back to the centre third for a centre pass like 7-a-side.\n\nThis version is a lot like original netball, with the court in divided into thirds and with seven players similarly positioned. Only 1-point shots are possible, and only from inside the shooting circle.\n\nThe ball shall be a universally accepted Netball or Association Football Size 5 and shall be supplied by the centre.\n\nThere are all different rules for Players playing: \n\nPenalty: Players in breach of proceeding requirements shall be penalised. The offending player may be removed from the court or a Three (3) Goal penalty will be awarded to the Non-Offending team.\n\nInternationally Australia and New Zealand have contested the Trans-Tasman Shield on a number of occasions. Following this series, South Africa joined the World Indoor Netball Association, and plans were put in place for the 2001 Indoor Netball World Cup in Australia. In June 2002 Australia and England travelled to South Africa for the WINA Tri-Series. Again Open Ladies, Open Mixed and Open Men were contested at this tournament.\n\nIn 2003 New Zealand hosted the World Cup in Auckland, contested between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. This was the first time that 21-&-Under Ladies was contested at a World Cup level, which has appeared in all subsequent Open events. Also at the 2003 World Cup, the World Indoor Netball Association introduced Over-30 Ladies, Over-30 Mixed and 18-&-Under divisions to their calendar of tournaments. In February 2004, Selected Masters & 18s Australian teams travelled to South Africa. The tour was a success and set the foundations for bi-annual tours to continue, with the next International series being held in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 a squad of netball players was selected by the (English) Indoor Netball Association (INA) to represent England at the Tri-Nations Cup, which was held in November 2007 in South Africa. Teams were entered in the U-19, Open Ladies and Open Mixed Categories. Australia won at all three levels of the tournament. Australia hosted the 2008 Indoor Netball World Cup in June on the Gold Coast in Queensland, where all four countries played the inaugural World Cup Series.\n\nIn 2010, South Africa held a Tri-Nations tournament for Open Men's, Women's and Mixed as well as U21 teams from South Africa Australia and England.\n\nIn 2012 Australia again hosted the Indoor Netball World Cup, in Brisbane, Queensland. Australia won every division (Ladies, Mens, Mixed and U21s) in both the 6-a-side and 7-a-side competitions. New Zealand teams were competitive in all divisions, dominating the grand finals.\n\nIn 2013, South Africa held the Tri-Nations Masters Series for Over 30s Mixed, Ladies and U18s Mixed and Ladies. South Africa in Australia competed in all divisions with England competing in the Ladies O30s and U18s.\n\nIn Australia there are two national championships held annually, the Open National Championships and the Aged National Championships. The Opens have four divisions: Men's, Ladies, Mixed and Under-21 Ladies, whilst the Aged Nationals have four divisions: Over 30 Ladies, Over 30 Mixed, Under 18 Mixed and the Under 18 Ladies. From these tournaments the respective All Star teams are chosen as a reflection of the best players in Australia in each division.\n\nIn New Zealand there are three major tournaments, held annually: the Northern Superleague competition (based in Auckland, also including Hamilton), The Central Superleague competition (based in Wellington, also including Manawatu, Taranaki and Napier and the Southern Superleague competition (based in Christchurch).\n\nAt the end of these seasons there is a National tournament which the best teams from these three competitions enter. This competition consists of a Mixed Grade,Mens Grade, Ladies Grade, Over40s Grade, Over 35s Grade, Over 30s Grade, Under 21s Grade and an Under 19s Grade. This takes place the first weekend of March each year.\n\nIn South Africa there are three national championships held annually, the Open & Mixed National Championships, the Overs and Unders Aged National Championships and the Juniors National Championships. The Opens & Mixed have six divisions: Men's, Ladies A & B, Mixed A & B and Under-21 Ladies, whilst the Overs & Unders Aged Nationals have three divisions: Over 30 Ladies, Over 35 Ladies, Over 30 Mixed, the Under 18 and Under 19 Ladies. All Star teams are chosen as a reflection of the best performers during the tournament in each division.\n\nIn 2007 INA England competed in its first Tri Nation Tournament in South Africa, against South Africa and Australia. Following on from this success INA England competed in the 2008 Indoor Netball World Cup in Australia.\n\nIn 2010 INA competed in its third World Cup tournament again in South Africa with the Women's Open team gaining a silver medal and an INA England player winning ‘Player of the Tournament’.\n\nIn the 2012 World Championships held in Brisbane, England's U21s squad gained Silver medals.\n\nIn 2013, England competed in the Masters Tri-Nations tournament entering an over 30s ladies team and Under 18s women's squad. The over 30s ladies squad reach the semi-finals narrowly missing out on a finals place to Australia.

The similarity in name and concept is such that many people sometimes mistakenly refer to Fruit by the Foot as \"Fruit Roll-Ups\" and vice versa. The snack is approximately long, and has a loop at the end. Current marketing slogans include \"3 Feet of Fun!\" In the early 1990s, Fruit by the Foot came with stickers that kids put on their lunch boxes to show they had eaten Fruit by the Foot. It is also very similar to Kellogg's Fruit Winders sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nSugar, in multiple forms, is the major ingredient of Fruit by the Foot, as it makes up 9 grams of each 21 gram serving.

Maccioni and his two top chefs began experimenting with game and fish, but eventually the baron and his guests wanted something different. Maccioni then mixed butter, cream and cheese, with vegetables and pasta and brought the recipe back to New York City. The fame of pasta primavera traces back to Maccioni's New York City restaurant Le Cirque, where it first appeared as an unlisted special before it was made famous through a 1977 article in the \"New York Times\" by Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey which included a recipe for the dish. The invention of the dish is contested; Le Cirque co-owner Sirio Maccioni claimed that his wife Egidiana threw it together from ingredients on hand during a trip to Nova Scotia; Ed Giobbi, an amateur cook himself, claims to have shown Maccioni and Jean Vergnes (then chef at Le Cirque) a similar dish which Vergnes then slightly modified, and chef Franco Brigandi claims to have invented it while the maitre d' at Il Gatto Pardo Ristorante in New York City and prepared it for Bob Lape on WABC television before his dish was requested to be cooked by other culinary practitioners.

Its feminine form is senhora (, abb. \"Sr.\" or \"Sra.\"; plural: \"senhoras\", abb. \"Sr.\" or \"Sras.\"). The term is related to Spanish \"señor\", Catalan \"senyor\", Occitan \"sénher\", French \"seigneur\", and Italian \"signore\".\n\nOriginally it was only used to designate a feudal lord or sire, as well as being one of the names of God. With time its usage spread and, as means of differentiation, noble people began to use \"Senhor Dom X\" (as when referring to the kings or members of the high nobility), which translates literally in English as \"The Lord, Lord X\".\n\nIn 1597, King Philip I issued a decree standardizing the noble styles in use in the Kingdom of Portugal. \"Sua Senhoria\" (translated as \"His Lordship\" or \"Her Ladyship\") was the prescribed manner of address to archbishops (with the exception of the Archbishop of Braga who, due to his rank as Primate of Hispania, was entitled to the style of \"Sua Senhoria Reverendíssima\", or \"His Most Reverend Lordship\"), bishops, dukes (with the exception of the Duke of Braganza, who was to be addressed as \"Sua Excelência\", Your Excellency, same as the King's grandchildren) and their children, marquises, counts, the Prior of Crato, viceroys and governors (when not related to the King), and other high authorities of the Kingdom (such as judges or ambassadors).\n\nPresently it is used in the same context as mister (\"senhor Silva\", or \"Sr. Silva\", meaning \"Mr. Silva\"), or as a way of saying a formal \"you\" (\"O senhor tem uma casa\" meaning \"You (male) have a house\"). In formal contexts \"o senhor, a senhora, os senhores\" and \"as senhoras\" (masculine singular, feminine singular, masculine plural, and feminine plural \"you\", respectively) are preferred. However, there is considerable regional variation in the use of these terms, and more specific forms of address are sometimes employed. \"O senhor\" and \"a senhora\" are the most ceremonious forms of address. English speakers may find the latter construction akin to the parliamentary convention of referring to fellow legislators in the third person (as \"my colleague\", \"the gentleman\", \"the member\", etc.), although the level of formality conveyed by o senhor is not as great. In fact, variants of \"o senhor\" and \"a senhora\" with more nuanced meanings such as \"o professor\" (\"professor\"), \"o colega\" (\"colleague\") and \"o pai\" (\"father\") are also employed as personal pronouns. Often \"senhor\" is followed by another title or job description, such as doctor (\"senhor doutor\"), engineer (\"senhor engenheiro\"), teacher or professor (\"senhor professor\"), or police officer (\"senhor polícia\"), thus conveying a high level of formality.\n\nTraditionally, but not presently, the feminine form \"senhora\" was only used for a married woman (a single woman was addressed formally as \"menina\", \"young girl\", in Portugal or by the diminutive \"senhorita\", \"little lady\", in Brazil).\n\n\n"}

By contrast, creams and gels have higher viscosity, typically due to lower water content. Lotions are applied to external skin with bare hands, a brush, a clean cloth, or cotton wool. \n\nWhile a lotion may be used as a medicine delivery system, many lotions, especially hand lotions and body lotions are meant instead to simply smooth, moisturize, soften and perhaps perfume the skin. \n\nSome skincare products, such as sunscreen and moisturizer, may be available in multiple formats, such as lotions, gels, creams, or sprays.\n\nDermatologists can prescribe lotions to treat or prevent skin diseases. It is not unusual for the same drug ingredient to be formulated into a lotion, cream and ointment. Creams are the most convenient of the three but are inappropriate for application to regions of hairy skin such as the scalp, while a lotion is less viscous and may be readily applied to these areas (many medicated shampoos are in fact lotions). Historically, lotions also had an advantage in that they may be spread thinly compared to a cream or ointment and may economically cover a large area of skin, but product research has steadily eroded this distinction. Non-comedogenic lotions are recommended for use on acne prone skin.\n\nLotions can be used for the delivery to the skin of medications such as:\n\nSince health care workers must wash their hands frequently to prevent disease transmission, hospital-grade lotion is recommended to prevent skin dermatitis caused by frequent exposure to cleaning agents in the soap. A 2006 study found that application of hospital-grade lotion after hand washing significantly reduced skin roughness and dryness.\n\nCare must be taken not to use consumer lotions in a hospital environment, as the perfumes and allergens may be a danger to those who are immunodeficient.\n\nMost cosmetic lotions are moisturizing lotions, although other forms, such as tanning lotion, also exist.\n\nCosmetic lotions may be marketed as anti-aging lotions, which can also be classified as a cosmetic in many cases, and may contain fragrances. The Food and Drug Administration voiced concern about lotions not classified as drugs that advertise anti-aging or anti-wrinkle properties.\n\nMost lotions are oil-in-water emulsions using a substance such as cetearyl alcohol to keep the emulsion together, but water-in-oil lotions are also formulated. The key components of a skin care lotion, cream or gel emulsion (that is mixtures of oil and water) are the and oily phases, an emulgent to prevent separation of these two phases, and, if used, the drug substance or substances. A wide variety of other ingredients such as fragrances, glycerol, petroleum jelly, dyes, preservatives, proteins and stabilizing agents are commonly added to lotions.\n\nSince thickness and consistency are key factors in lotions and creams, it is important to understand the manufacturing process that determines viscosity.\n\nManufacturing lotions and creams can be completed in two cycles:\n\nA typical oil-in-water manufacturing process might go like this:\n\nCareful note should be taken in choosing the right mixing equipment for lotion manufacturing to avoid agglomerates and long processing times. It can make all the difference in manufacturing time and costs. Conventional agitators can present a number of problems including agglomerates and longer processing times. On the other hand, high shear in-line mixers can produce quality lotions and creams without many of the complications encountered with conventional mixers. Sonolation is also a process that is growing in popularity.\n\nDepending on their composition, lotions can be comedogenic, meaning that they can result in the increased formation of comedones (clogged hair follicles). People who are prone to acne or forming comedones often prefer lotions that are designed to be non-comedogenic (not causing outbreaks).\n\nAll topical products, including lotions, can result in the percutaneous (through the skin) absorption of their ingredients. Though this has some use as a route of drug administration, it more commonly results in unintended side effects. For example, medicated lotions such as diprolene are often used with the intention of exerting only local effects, but absorption of the drug through the skin can occur to a small degree, resulting in systemic side effects such as hyperglycemia and glycosuria. \n\nAbsorption through the skin is increased when lotions are applied and then covered with an occlusive layer, when they are applied to large areas of the body, or when they are applied to damaged or broken skin.\n\nThere is currently no regulation over use of the term \"hypoallergenic\", and even pediatric skin products with the label were found to still contain allergens. Those with eczema are especially vulnerable to an allergic reaction with lotion, as their compromised skin barrier allows preservatives to bind with and activate immune cells.\n\nThe American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology warns that natural lotion containing ingredients commonly found in food (such as goats milk, cow's milk, coconut milk, or oil) may introduce new allergies, and an allergic reaction when those foods are later consumed.\n\n\n"}

Leafy greens such as endive may be left raw and added to the potatoes only at the mashing stage. Some less common regional varieties of \"stamppot\" are made with fruit and potatoes, such as \"blauwe bliksem\" (blue lightning), made with pears, and \"hete bliksem\" (hot lightning), made with apples. Pineapple may also be included in sauerkraut or endive stamppot.In recent years, variations on the traditional stamppot have been becoming more and more popular with people adding ingredients such as rocket, leeks, beets, sweet potato, mushrooms and various other vegetables. Sometimes, fish is used as an ingredient in stamppot as well instead of serving it as a separate dish. Stamppot is primarily a cold-weather dish. \n\n\"Stamppot\" is usually served with sausage (in the Netherlands often smoked, in Belgium more often fried), julienned bacon, or stewed meat. Other accompaniments include cheese, gherkins, nuts or pickled onions.\n\nPrepared \"stamppot\" can be purchased from shops and supermarkets. It can also be ordered in cafe-style restaurants, but more strict recent regulations about allowed foods in taverns versus restaurants has restricted the custom of offering simple dishes in many Belgian pubs.\n\nThe origin of \"stamppot\" is unknown, although legend attributes the invention of \"hutspot\" to 1574. Using raw leafy vegetables instead of cooking them with the potatoes has not been dated to earlier than 1940.\n\nThere are two methods of preparing \"stamppot\", the first being the more modern form:\n\nLardons (\"spekjes\") are often added for flavoring. It is also common to make a small hole in the top of the mix on the plate and fill it with gravy, known in Dutch as a \"kuiltje jus\" (little gravy pit).\n\n\n"}

Back then, as well as nowadays, the supporters of this policy refer to it as the \"Revival Process\", while critics call it \"the so-called Vǎzroditelen process\".

The argument was that the Turkish population of Bulgaria were allegedly Bulgarians forced to convert to Islam during the Ottoman rule.\n\nThis project met forceful resistance in the form of large-scale protests, international pressure and cases of terrorism.

The Pure Drinks Group and Campa Beverages Pvt. Ltd. virtually dominated the entire Indian soft drink industry for about 15 years, and then started Campa Cola during the absence of foreign competition.

The term dha is conventionally used to refer to a wide variety of knives and swords used by many people across Southeast Asia, especially present-day Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Yunnan, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nThe broad use and diffusion of the dha across Southeast Asia makes it difficult to attribute a definitive origin. The Burmese moved into Southeast Asia from the northwest (present day India), passing through Assam and Nagaland. The dha and its variants were possibly derived from the Assamese and Naga dao, a broadsword used by both the Assamese people and Naga people of northeast India for digging as well as killing. The Naga weapon was a thick, heavy, eighteen-inch long backsword with a bevel instead of a point, and this form of blade is found on some dha. \n\nAlternatively, the dha may have its origins with the Tai people who migrated to the area from present-day Yunnan Province in southern China. The Khmer and Mon peoples were well established before the arrival the Tai or the Burmese people; perhaps they invented the dha as 13th-century reliefs at Angkor depict the weapon. The history of the region includes many periods where one or the other of these groups dominated, bringing along their culture and weapons to conquered areas.\n\nSimilar terms exist in the surrounding area with slightly different meanings. The Chinese word \"dao\" (\"dou\" in Cantonese) means knife but can refer to any bladed weapon with only one edge. In Bengali, a \"dao\" is a six inch long knife. From the Himalayas, the dao spread to Southeast Asia where it came into its present shape. While it is pronounced dha in Burmese, among Khmer-speakers it is known as \"dao\" and it may be related to the Malay words \"pedang\" and \"sundang\", meaning sword. A related term, \"dap\", means a long-handled sword in Malay. In Thailand, the dha corresponds to the \"krabi\" () but the equivalent Thai term is \"daab\" which is usually a single-edge sword.\n\nDha vary considerably according to locality but they share a few features that define them apart from other weapons and tools of the area. These features are a round cross-section grip, a long, gently curving blade (sometimes upward, other times downward in the direction of use) with a single edge, and no guard. Knives and swords with these characteristics are viewed by ethnic groups of the region as being of a single type, albeit with variations arising from local style and tradition.\nThere are a large number of possible shapes for the tip, with upswept, downswept, squared-off and spear-like varieties all being found. The blades are often inscribed, which can range from a simple maker's mark to quite intricate designs that may also feature inlays.\n\nHilts range from hand-width to quite long. A blade/hilt length ratio of 2:1 is not uncommon. Despite these long handles, most dha are meant for single-handed use, although some two-handed weapons exist. Guards are small, if present at all. Thai daab may have a guard similar to that of the Japanese katana. The montagnard dha may have a guard that barely exceeds the diameter of the handle and they can be regarded more as a spacer. The construction of the hilt varies widely by type and region or origin. Hilts range from simple wood, possibly wrapped in rattan or covered in ray skin, to elaborately worked silver and ivory. Pommels may or may not be present. Scabbards are made from two strips of wood, often bamboo, secured by metal bands, rattan (e.g., \"village\" dha), or completely wrapped in metal.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Wearing a Sikh dastaar, or turban, is mandatory for all Sikh men and women.\n\nAmong the Sikhs, the dastaar is an article of faith that represents honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality, and piety. The Khalsa Sikh men and women, who keep the Five Ks, wear the turban to cover their long, uncut hair (\"kesh\"). The Sikhs regard the dastaar as an important part of the unique Sikh identity.\n\nThe dastaar has been an important part of the Sikh religion since the time of the First Guru. Guru Nanak Dev ji honoured Guru Amar Das with a special dastaar when he was declared the next Guru. When Guru Ram Das died, Guru Arjun Dev was honoured with the dastaar of Guruship.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh, the last human Sikh Guru, wrote:\n\nBhai Rattan Singh Bhangu, one of the earliest Sikh historians, wrote in \"Sri Gur Panth Parkash\":\n\nIn the Khalsa society, the turban signifies many virtues:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many Punjabi idioms and proverbs that describe how important is a dastaar in one's life. Bhai Gurdas writes:\n\nThe Dastaar is considered an integral part of the unique Sikh identity. The bare head is not considered appropriate as per gurbani. If a Sikh wants to become one with his/her guru, he/she must look like a guru (wear a dastaar). Guru Gobind Singh stated:\n\nMaintaining long hair and tying the dastaar is seen as a token of love, obedience of the wishes of Sikh gurus, and acceptance to the Will of God. A quote from Sikhnet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the basic Sikh Pugaree types. Turban theory states that the main pugaree types are starting points, and anyone can invent their own Dastaar styles.\n\nIn May 2009, \"The Times of India\" reported that British researchers were trying to make a \"bulletproof turban\" that would allow the Sikhs in the British police to serve in firearms units.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks in USA, a number of dastaar-wearing Sikhs faced assaults by some Americans who confused them with Muslims, who were being associated with terrorism.. Due to Sikh Turbans resembling turban that Osama Bin Laden wore in his most iconic photo, United States Department of Justice worked with the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund (SALDEF) to issue a poster aimed at getting Americans acquainted with Sikh turbans.\n\nIn modern times, there have been conflicts between Sikhs – especially those outside India – and laws which conflict with always wearing a dastaar.\nSikh soldiers refused to wear helmets during World War I and World War II. Many Sikhs have refused to remove the dastaar even in jails. Sikh scholar and social activist Bhai Randhir Singh underwent a fast to be able to wear a dastaar in prison.\n\nIn the UK in 1982, the headmaster of a private school refused to admit an orthodox Sikh as a pupil unless he removed the dastaar and cut his hair. This led to the long legal battle, \"Mandla v. Dowell Lee\", a case which contributed to the creation of the legal term \"ethno-religious\".\n\nIn Canada in 1990, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Baltej Singh Dhillon, an RCMP officer, should be allowed to wear a dastaar while on duty. See the case of \"Grant v. Canada A.G (1995) 125 D.L.R. (4th) 556 (F.C.A.) aff'd (1994) 81 F.T.R. 195 (F.C.T.D.) (Reed J.)\" where the court said that the Sikh RCMP officer had a constitutional right to wear his Dastaar and that the government’s decision to accommodate him was required to protect freedom of religion:\n\n\"The defendants and the intervenors, particularly the able argument of Ms. Chotalia for the Alberta Civil Liberties Association, turn the plaintiffs' argument respecting discrimination on its head. They argue that the Commissioner's decision was designed to prevent discrimination occurring to Khalsa Sikhs. As such they argue that that decision offends none of the provisions of the Charter, indeed that it is required by section 15 of the Charter.\" para 103 \nShirish Chotalia, Alberta lawyer, represented the Sikh Society of Calgary, the Alberta Civil Liberties Association, and the Friends of the Sikhs, pro bono.\n\nIn the United States in 2002, Jasjit Singh Jaggi, a Sikh traffic policeman employed with the New York Police Department, was forced to leave his job because he insisted on wearing a dastaar on duty. He petitioned with the New York Human Rights Commission, and in 2004 a US judge ruled that he should be reinstated.\n\nIn France in 2004, the Sikh community protested against the introduction of a law prohibiting the display of any religious symbols in state-run schools. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee urged the French Government to review the bill, stating that the ban would have grave consequences for the Sikhs. The Government of India discussed the matter with the French officials, who stated that an exception for turbaned Sikh boys in French public schools was not possible.\n\nIn 2007, the Canadian government introduced new procedures for accommodation of Sikhs in regard to passport photos, driver licensing, and other legal licensing. This bill was also supported by the Sikh Council of Canada.\n\nIn April 2009, Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi and 2nd Lt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan challenged a U.S. Army order that they remove their turbans and shave their beards. In March 2010, Rattan became the first Sikh to graduate Army Officer School at Fort Sam Houston since the exemption was eliminated in 1984; a waiver was granted for his religion. Kalsi will also attend basic training.\n\nIn Ireland, Ravinder Singh Oberoi applied to become a member of the Garda (police) Reserve (a voluntary, unpaid position) but was not permitted to wear a dastaar. He unsuccessfully claimed discrimination on grounds of race and religion; the High Court ruled in 2013 on a preliminary issue that he could not claim under employment equality legislation as he was not an employee and was not in vocational training.\n\nIn 2012 British media reported that a Guardsman of the Scots Guards Jatinderpal Singh Bhullar became the first Sikh to guard Buckingham Palace wearing a dastaar instead of the traditional bearskin.\n\nSikh members of the Canadian Armed Forces are permitted to wear the dastaar on all orders of dress within the forces, although the unit commander retains the right to order for adjustments should a conflict arise with operational safety. The colour of the dastaar for Sikh service members within the Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force are required to match the colours of their unit's headgear. Sikhs serving within the Royal Canadian Navy are required to wear a white dastaar when peaked caps are worn, and a black dastaar when berets are worn. The unit's cap badge must also be worn on the dastaar. Additionally, some units in the Canadian Armed Forces add a ribbon matching their regimental colours, worn crossed behind the cap badge and tucked in at the back.\n\nIn several parts of the world, Sikh riders are exempted from legal requirements to wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle or a bicycle, which cannot be done without removing the Dastaar. These places include India, Nepal and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba. Other places include Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In Queensland, Australia, riders of bicycles and mobility scooters are exempt from wearing an approved helmet, but not motorcyclists.\nIn 2008, Baljinder Badesha, a Sikh man living in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, lost a court case in which he challenged a $110 ticket received for wearing a Dastaar instead of a helmet while riding his motorcycle.\n\nIn September 2016 a court in Quebec, Canada, ruled that Sikh truck drivers working at the Port of Montreal must wear hard hats when required for safety reasons, effectively requiring them to remove their dastaar. The judge stated that their safety outweighed their religious freedom. Previously Sikh drivers were able to avoid wearing hard hats if they remained within their vehicle, but this increased the loading times and was not commercially acceptable.\n\n"}
