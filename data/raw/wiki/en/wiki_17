{"id": "4671515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4671515", "title": "Match cut", "text": "Match cut\n\nIn film, a match cut is a cut from one shot to another where the two shots are matched by the action or subject and subject matter. For example, in a duel a shot can go from a long shot on both contestants via a cut to a medium closeup shot of one of the duellists. The cut matches the two shots and is consistent with the logic of the action. This is a standard practice in film-making, to produce a seamless reality-effect.\n\nMatch cuts form the basis for continuity editing, such as the ubiquitous use of match on action. Continuity editing smooths over the inherent discontinuity of shot changes to establish a logical coherence between shots. Even within continuity editing, though, the match cut is a contrast both with cross-cutting between actions in two different locations that are occurring simultaneously, and with parallel editing, which draws parallels or contrasts between two different time-space locations.\n\nA graphic match (as opposed to a graphic contrast or collision) occurs when the shapes, colors and/or overall movement of two shots match in composition, either within a scene or, especially, across a transition between two scenes. Indeed, rather than the seamless cuts of continuity editing within a scene, the term \"graphic match\" usually denotes a more conspicuous transition between (or comparison of) two shots via pictorial elements. A match cut often involves a graphic match, a smooth transition between scenes and an element of metaphorical (or at least meaningful) comparison between elements in both shots.\n\nA match cut contrasts with the conspicuous and abrupt discontinuity of a jump cut.\n\nStanley Kubrick's \"\" contains a famous example of a match cut. After an ape discovers the use of bones as a tool and a weapon, he throws one triumphantly into the air. As the bone spins in the air, there is a match cut to a much more advanced tool: an orbiting satellite. The match cut helps draw a connection between the two objects as exemplars of primitive and advanced tools respectively, and serves as a neat summary of humanity's technological advancement up to that point. The satellite is unidentified in the film, but the novel makes it clear that it is an orbital weapon platform, thus linking with the use of the bone as a weapon.\n\nMichael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's \"A Canterbury Tale\" is a predecessor for the \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" match cut in which a fourteenth-century falcon cuts to a World War II aeroplane. The sense of time passing but nothing changing is emphasised by having the same actor, in different costumes, looking at both the falcon and the aeroplane.\n\nAn early example comes from Orson Welles's \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which opens with a series of match dissolves that keeps the titular character's lit window in the same part of the frame while the cuts take viewers around his dilapidated Xanadu estate, before a final match dissolve takes viewers from the outside to the inside where Kane is dying.\n\nAnother match cut comes from \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (David Lean, 1962) where an edit cuts together Lawrence blowing out a lit match with the desert sun rising from the horizon. Director David Lean credits inspiration for the edit to the experimental French New Wave. The edit was later praised by Steven Spielberg as inspiration for his own work.\n\nA match cut occurs at the end of Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\". As Cary Grant pulls Eva Marie Saint up from Mount Rushmore, the cut then goes to him pulling her up to his bunk on the train. The match cut here skips over the courting, the marriage proposal, and the actual marriage of the two characters who had for much of the film been adversaries. Another Hitchcock film to employ the use of a match cut is \"Psycho\". Just after Marion Crane is murdered in the \"shower scene\", the camera shows blood flowing down the drain of the tub, then cuts (dissolves) to a shot of Marion's eye.\n\nGerman director Fritz Lang provided early uses of match cuts in his silent and first sound films. In \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\", he shows a circular casino from above and cuts to a circle of hands at a seance happening the same night involving Mabuse and others. This smoothly changes into the simultaneous scene and links the two activities as \"decadent\" pastimes of the rich in pursuit of excitement and celebrity. Lang reused the technique in \"M\" while cross cutting between the meetings of Schränker's criminal union and Inspector Karl Lohmann's homicide investigation squad. Schränker and Lohmann are matched in movement and in dialogue (which is carried over the cut to form a coherent phrase) to illustrate their unlikely connection in a shared goal, to capture a serial child killer.\n\nThe \"Morning in America\" campaign commercial for US President Ronald Reagan's successful 1984 re-election bid also uses this technique. Early in the ad there are match cuts between a taxi cab, a tractor, and a bike, all facing the camera with the headlights on. Later there is a match cut between two men, both hoisting the American flag.\n\nFor his 1986 fantasy film \"Highlander\", director Russell Mulcahy employs multiple match cuts to indicate movements backwards in time and forwards again to the present day, telling the story of an immortal who relives episodes from his past in the ancient Highlands of Scotland (and later across Europe), as he faces his final challenge in modern New York City. Examples include a World Wrestling Federation match cutting back to the bloody clan battles of his youth, a fish tank cutting back to an experience in a boat on a loch, and an emotional face in the past dissolving into a giant NYC advertising hoarding showing the impassive \"Mona Lisa\". In the case of this film, the match cut is integral to the storytelling, as a potentially confusing back-and-forth narrative is thus held together; with the denouement's final cut to Scotland cleverly revealed to be not a jump in time, as previously, through the inclusion of a modern fighter jet in flight over the Highlands.\n\nIn the 1986 film \"Aliens\" there is a match cut between a close-up of Ripley's sleeping face and a distant shot of planet Earth.\n\nYet another example of a match cut can be found in the final episode of the first season of David Lynch and Mark Frost's television show \"Twin Peaks\". In the opening moments as Dr. Jacoby is struck down by a masked assailant and rolls over onto his back, the camera zooms in onto his eye which slowly fades away to a roulette wheel in One Eyed Jack's casino. This transition is a key moment in the episode as it connects two very different story lines together through a strategic cut.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" make major usage of the match cut, providing seamless transitions between scenes. Notable examples include the cut from young Homer to current-day Homer in \"Bart Star\", the transition from Marge to the character in her novel, in \"Diatribe of a Mad Housewife\", and hundreds more. The usage of the match cut has ultimately become a major recurring trait of the series.\n\nTarsem Singh's \"The Fall\" features a match cut where the costume, hairstyle, and facial expression of a character was matched nearly perfectly to the background of the next scene, without the use of digital enhancement, as well as other examples.\n\n\n"}

It has no structure, and is traditionally done on public land. Riders for natural jumps and drop-offs to execute their tricks on. Some freeriders prefer to jump on sand dunes. In many ways, freeriding requires more skill and mental ability. Notable freeriding locations include Ocotillo Wells and Glamis Dunes in California, Beaumont, California, and Caineville, Utah.\n\nThe backflip was once considered all but impossible, the \"holy grail of FMX\". Freestyle riders began contemplating it after the 1998 film \"Children of a Metal God\" showed riders attempting the trick into water. Also it had been done many times on BMX bikes, and FMX riders were using tricks from BMX riders, such as when Travis Pastrana performed an Indian Air, originally from Mat Hoffman, a BMXer.\n\nIn 1991, Jose Yanez became the first person to backflip a motocross bike. He practiced for it by flipping his motorcycle into the Salt River, just as he had done with his BMX bike. He would kill the engine on his 80cc motorcycle just before he hit the water to prevent damage to the bike. Yanez performed the world's first ramp-to-ramp motocross backflip on an 80cc motorcycle in October, 1991 on an 8' tall box jump he built himself in Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Jose's next motocross backflip attempt, this time for The National Enquirer resulted in a crash that kept Jose off motorcycles and bicycles for two years due to an injured knee.\n\nIn 1993, Bob Kohl was the second person to perform the backflip on a motocross bike. The bike was a 1993 Honda Cr80. He was a professional BMX rider who had performed the trick regularly on a bicycle. He continued to exhibit the trick until a crash in 1995 left him with serious injuries.\n\nIn 2000, Carey Hart attempted the first backflip on a full-size motocross bike off a modified dirt landing ramp at the Gravity Games 2000. The landing was less than perfect, and Hart crashed immediately after. But Freestyle Motocross was forever changed. Many people started to attempt it, such as Travis Pastrana, who attempted the backflip off a Step Up jump at Summer X Games Freestyle. He bailed off mid-flight, breaking his foot. The trick was still not attempted on a normal FMX setup, off a ramp-to-dirt setup. Hart attempted the backflip again at Summer X Games in 2001, during the Moto X Best Trick competition, but bailed off the bike in the air, seriously injuring himself.\n\nIn 2002, Caleb Wyatt was the first person to land a backflip on a large motorcycle, on April 25, 2002, at the Rogue Valley Motocross track (RVMX). This backflip was performed over a mulch pile of grass clippings, leaves, and bark collected during maintenance of the RVMX track. Wyatt constructed a quarter-pipe ramp with the take-off completely vertical shoved into the pile of mulch.\n\n2002 brought the backflip to X Games glory. Travis Pastrana and Mike Metzger were both capable doing flips off ramps. Kenny Bartram was still learning flips, doing them off the backsides of dirt landings, much like Hart in the 2000 Gravity Games. The unthinkable had become reality; a backflip was now common in freestyle competition. Mike Metzger had achieved a back-to-back backflip, which won him Freestyle Gold at Summer X Games 8. When the Gravity Games came along, riders were doing variations in their backflips, wowing the crowd and the judges, who didn't know how to score the riders.\n\nIn 2003, regular tricks were being used in backflips such as 'No Footers', 'HeelClickers', and 'One Handed' Backflips.\n\n2003 - 2005: These years saw the development of variations including cliffhangers, cordovas etc. As well as the disputed 360s which some consider only off-axis flips. The backflip was perfected over large distances including over . In 2005 at the very first Dew Tour in Louisville, Kentucky, Travis Pastrana landed four backflips in a row. At the Denver Dew Tour in 2006, Kenny Bartram was the first to pull a one-handed takeoff backflip. In 2009 while filming for \"Nitro Circus\", Pastrana completed a backflip as part of a larger crossover jump, flipping over a number of riders below in the process.\n\n2006 brought footage of Travis Pastrana completing a double backflip on an uphill/sand setup on his popular \"Nitro Circus\" Freestyle Motocross movies. On August 4, 2006, at X Games 12 in Los Angeles, he became the first rider to land a double backflip in competition. Having landed another trick that many had considered impossible, he vowed never to do it again.\n\n2007 saw Scott Murray perform double backflips onto a large piece of foam placed over the end of a foam pit. Later that year, Murray attempted the double backflip at X Games but crashed upon landing. He landed the trick at a Supercross event in Italy.\nAt the 2008 Summer X games Jim Dechamp tried a front flip and crashed, breaking his back. Three months later during Nitro Circus season 1 on MTV, Dechamp landed the front flip during the Guinness World Record episode.\n\nIn early 2009, Metal Mulisha rider Jeremy Lusk attempted a Hart Attack Indian Air Backflip. He under-rotated, and crashed, hitting his head on the landing. On February 10, he was pronounced dead due to head and spinal cord injuries.\n\nAt X Games 17, Jackson Strong nailed the first front flip on a dirt bike during the best trick competition.\n\nIn early 2015, Nitro Circus rider Josh Sheehan landed the first triple backflip, yet another trick deemed impossible by many, on a custom ramp/dirt setup at Travis Pastrana’s “Pastranaland” complex in Maryland. he had previously practiced the trick onto a large air cushion at the Maryland complex, using the same custom ramp built for the stunt.\n\nAt the Nitro World Games in 2016, Greg Duffy landed the first double front flip.\n\nFMX riders typically use much of the same riding gear as MX racers. This includes a helmet, goggles, gloves, boots, jersey, neck brace, chest protector, and MX pants. They may supplement this with elbow and knee pads. Riders may also choose to wear 'body armour' to protect the chest and legs when performing the most dangerous of tricks, as did Travis Pastrana when performing his double backflips.\n\nRiders use modified motocross bikes with aftermarket parts to lower weight and improve performance. Riders will often shave down the seat foam to give a wider range of motion and better grip on the seat. Steering stabilizers are also common and help keep the front tire running straight when tricks requiring the rider to let go of the handlebars are performed. Many riders will also shorten the width of the handlebars, to make it easier to put the legs on the bars, like such tricks as the 'heelclicker' or 'rodeo'. Excess cables, such as brakes and clutch cables are usually redirected away from the bars, to avoid riders getting their boots caught on the bike. The engine and mechanical details of an FMX bike are fairly stock, not needing the fine-tuning of a racing bike. Riders may also choose to have 'lever' on their handlebars to help then when performing 'Kiss Of Death Backflips.' A 'lever' is usually a metal plate or pipe coming off the handlebars, and going in front of the riders wrist or lower arm to stop the rider from rotating during the flips, but letting the bike continue to move. Bikes have aftermarket performance pipes that give more power. The bike must have very strong suspension and very high-quality tires.\n\n\n\n"}

With the abundance of cod around the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador it became synonymous with many Newfoundland households as a delicacy to be served as a main meal.\n\nThe recipe may vary from community to community or even household to household, but the primary ingredients are always the same. The typical recipe calls for salt fish that is soaked in water overnight to reduce the salt content of the fish, and the hard bread is also soaked in water overnight. The next day, the fish and hard bread are boiled separately until tender, and then both are served together.\n\nThe traditional meal is served with \"scrunchions\", salted pork fat which has been cut into small pieces and fried. Both the rendered fat and the liquid fat are then drizzled over the fish and brewis.\n\nFisherman's brewis is the same as fish and brewis, but the fish and bread are chopped while hot and mixed together with the scrunchions, and often fresh cod is used instead of salt cod.\n\n\"Drawn butter\" is sometimes used instead of scrunchions. Drawn butter in this instance is a mixture of melted butter and chopped onions that is thickened by flour in a saucepan, then served hot over the fish and hard bread.\n\nIn some Nova Scotia households, this dish is known as \"Salt cod and pork scraps\" where the mixture can also be served on a plate next to a mound of plain boiled potatoes and carrots.\n\nThe meal was originally developed by sailors who were often at sea for weeks, and even months, where few fresh ingredients were able to withstand such lengthy trips. Therefore, long-lasting foods were a necessity, and fish and brewis became the crew's favorite. The idea that sailors called the hardtack or sea biscuit \"brewis\" (pronounced 'brews') because of their practice of bruising or breaking up the bread into bite-size pieces is likely part of a contemporary legend, and it has been argued more convincingly that the word \"brewis\" dates back to Middle English, originally referred to bread soaked in fat or dripping and is cognate with brose. A variant of brewis is found in Wales.\n"}

Cascarones are common throughout Mexico and are similar to the Easter eggs popular in many other countries. They are mostly used in Mexico during Carnival, but in US and Mexico border towns the cultures combined to make them a popular Easter tradition.\n\nDecorated, confetti-filled cascarones may be thrown or crushed over the recipient's head to shower them with confetti. This originated in Spain. When a child would act up, their father would crack an egg over their head as a consequence, and a way of showing their disappointment in them. In addition to Easter, cascarones have become popular for occasions including birthdays, New Year's, Halloween, Cinco de Mayo, Dieciséis, Day of the Dead, and weddings. (wedding cascarones can be filled with rice). Like many popular traditions in Mexico, cascarones are increasingly popular in the southwestern United States. For example, they are especially prominent during the two-week, citywide festival of Fiesta in San Antonio, Texas. Cascarones are usually made during Easter time.\n\nIn order to make cascarones, one can use a pin or knife to break a hole in the end of the eggshell and pour the contents out. The shell is then cleaned out, decorated as desired, and allowed to dry, before it is filled with confetti or a small toy. Usually, glue is applied around the outside of the hole and covered with tissue paper.\n\nCascarones was said to originate from China to Spain and eventually Mexico by Marco Polo. An article about Christmas celebrations published in the Los Angeles Star newspaper on January 4, 1855, includes the sentence, \"In the city, cascarones commanded a premium, and many were complimented with them as a finishing touch to their headdress.\" Maximilian and his wife Carlota did not arrive in Mexico until 1864, nine years later. It was in Mexico that the perfumed powder was replaced with confetti.\n\n"}

They are a close relative of the more widely known Eccles cake, but have some significant differences.\n\nThe Chorley cake is significantly less sweet than its Eccles cousin, and is commonly eaten with a light spread of butter on top, and sometimes a slice of Lancashire cheese on the side. A Chorley cake is made using currants, sandwiched between two layers of unsweetened shortcrust pastry, whereas an Eccles cake uses flaky puff pastry, which after baking is normally a deeper brown in colour.\n\nThe other difference is that the currants in the Eccles cake are often concentrated together in the middle while in the Chorley cake the fruit is usually evenly distributed. It is not uncommon to see some sugar added to the fruit, or sweeter raisins or sultanas used. Locals often refer to Chorley cake as Fly Pie. \n\nAlso related to the Chorley cake is East Lancashire's \"Sad Cake\", made to a similar recipe. It was found in the Darwen, Blackburn, Accrington, Burnley, Colne, Nelson and Padiham areas and throughout the Rossendale area. Sad cake is often up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter, as opposed to the Chorley cake being 3 to 5 inches (8 to 12 cm) and is made by rolling out the pastry and dropping raisins and/or currants evenly over the pastry then folding in on several sides and then rolling out again to the required size, usually round but can be square.\n\nIt was then cut into triangular sections similar to a sponge cake section and was a regular addition in a working man's lunch box (the whole meal was known as bagging, snap or packing). The sad cake was a filler for eating either after one's sandwiches or as a separate tea break snack during the working day in the cotton mills and coal mines of Lancashire. A spread of margarine, butter or even jam was placed on top. It may be eaten with sandwiches of jam and crumbly soft Lancashire cheese.\n\nThe October \"Chorley Cake Street Fair\", restarted in 1995, promotes the cakes, with a competition for local bakers to produce the largest ever Chorley cake.\n\n\n"}

In addition to its liquid ingredients, \"sikhye\" contains grains of cooked rice and in some cases pine nuts.\n\n\"Sikhye\" is made by pouring malt water onto cooked rice. The malt water steeps in the rice at typically 65 degrees Celsius until grains of rice appear on the surface. The liquid is then carefully poured out, leaving the rougher parts, and boiled until it gets sweet enough (no sugar is added to this drink).\n\nIn South Korea and in overseas Korean grocery stores, \"sikhye\" is readily available in cans or plastic bottles. One of the largest South Korean producers of \"sikhye\" is the Vilac company of Busan. Most canned \"sikhye\" typically has a residue of cooked rice at the bottom. Homemade \"sikhye\" is often served after a meal in a Korean restaurant.\n\nThere are several regional variations of \"sikhye\". These include Andong \"sikhye\" and \"yeonyeop sikhye\" or \"yeonyeopju\", a variety of \"sikhye\" made in Gangwon province. Andong \"sikhye\" differs in that it includes radishes, carrots, and powdered red pepper. Also, it is fermented for several days as opposed to being boiled. The crunchy texture of the radish is kept despite the longer fermentation process; a soft texture would indicate an inferior product. Whereas the sweet canned or restaurant sikhye is enjoyed as a dessert beverage, Andong sikhye is appreciated as a digestive aid, containing lactobacillus.\n\n\"Sikhye\" is also referred to by the names \"dansul\" (단술) and \"gamju\" (감주; 甘酒). Both of these names mean \"sweet wine.\" However, they are also used to refer to a different, slightly alcoholic rice drink called \"gamju\".\n\n\"Hobak-sikhye\" (pumpkin sikhye) is a water-boiled broth with pumpkin, steamed rice, and malt. It is fermented for several days at a proper temperature. Some sugar is added to taste sweet.\n\nIt is original sikhye in Andong, South Korea. It is a little bit different from other Sikhyes. This Sikhye's color is light red with red pepper added.\n\nYeonyeop-sikhye is made by wrapping the hot glutinous rice, sake, and honey in a lotus leaf. Before drinking, put up a few pieces of pine nuts.\n\nSikhye is believed to aid digestion, it contains dietary fiber and anti-oxidants. It was regularly served to royalty after meals to help digestion.\n\nSikhye is said to help people who have a \"cold\" constitution to be warm and also helps those who have too \"warm\" constitution to be less warm.

Since 1988 he is emeritus researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.)\n\nThe historical validity of toltequity as such tends to be controversial, historians do not even agree in the Toltec city which is known as such, Tula is usually considered (the settlement known as the \"Chico\") as the base around year 550, and is closely related to the Quetzalcoatl history, while there are four origins, all agree in that he was a King, son of Mixcōātl and Chimalma, and who later was worshipped as God, and later would become one of the main gods in the Anahuac. While the Toltec gave rise to the founding of a legendary city called Tula or Tōllan (\"Tōl-+-tlan\" = Capital, the name of the Toltec city itself was \"Xicocotitlan\").\n\nToltec was a generic name applied to all Mesoamerica inhabitants of. Derived from the root \"tol-\", which meant originally 'stem, Reed', which gave birth to the name of the city of Tula or \"Tollan\" ('(place with abundant) reeds') and due to the cultural tradition of the Toltec City (originally ' inhabitant of Tula') came to acquire the sense of 'educated person'. Toltec ideas received the name of tōltēcayōtl 'toltequity' and were made up of religious, artistic and scientific formulas that reflected the Mesoamerican cosmovision.\n\nThe definition of the Toltecs as a historical or ethnic group is a fact established by researchers in a round table in 1941. Currently, new age groups claim very disparate things to justify the native use of the term Toltec:\n\n<poem> </poem >\n\n<poem> </poem >\n\n<poem> </poem >\n\n<poem> </poem >\n\n<poem> </poem >\n\nCurrently, the term \"Toltec\" is used by various New Age groups and by neo-nagualism practitioners. On the other hand, groups who claim to rescue the national identity roots assert without proof, having recuperated the original use of the name, applying it to anyone who follows the Toltec life principles; these are not validated by the Popper's falsifiability principle\n\nThe idea of neo-shamanism groups, derived from the author Carlos Castaneda, is summarized in that a lifestyle can be lived with respect for elders, to obtain knowledge and preserve it without harming others.\n\nFrom the neo-shamanism movement point of view, Ken Eagle mentions in his book similar topics as Carlos Castaneda, with the exception that makes connection with elements of the army of United States (Rangers) rather than the term originally used by Castaneda, Stalkers. In the book the Toltec path also recounts situations that appear to be alien channels, which removes historical seriousness from the term.\n\nCarlos Castaneda refers generically to the Toltec as \"secret conservators\" in his book \"The Second Ring of Power\", and in recent years a movement has been created divided into two parts, on the one hand the books by Don Miguel Ruiz, that shows a series of ideas or moral principles, and on the other hand a series of courses New Age type, that advertises on the handling of a return to the roots.\n\n\n"}

Wraith (not to be confused with the earlier small horsepower (Goshawk) car, the 25/30 h.p), was launched in 1938. \n\nThe Rolls-Royce Wraith was built by Rolls-Royce at their Derby factory from 1938 to 1939 and supplied to independent coachbuilders as a running chassis.\n\nWraith is also the name of a new coupé announced by Rolls-Royce in 2013.\n\nWraith is an old Scottish word meaning Ghost or Spirit, continuing Rolls-Royce's (at the time) new(ish) nomenclature that they had adopted, using words relating to silent, gracious, elegant, rarely seen and highly sought after for these reasons. In fact, the Wraith name originated from a 40/50 h.p, (Silver Ghost) that was named 'The Wraith' by its original owner.\n\nThe in-line six cylinder, overhead valve, 4,257 cc engine was based on that of the 25/30 but featured a cross-flow cylinder head. The four-speed gearbox had synchromesh on second, third and fourth speeds and retained the traditional right hand change. The later engines were used as the basis for the Bentley MK V and the Corniche.\n\nThe Wraith featured an independent coil sprung front suspension based on a Packard 120 retaining semi elliptical leaf springs on the rear axle. The hydraulic dampers at the front had their damping rate controlled by governor and so varied with the speed of the car, making it superior to its predecessor, the 25/30 H.P. and on par with the Phantom III. The car was still built on a separate chassis but this was now of welded rather than the traditional riveted construction. The drum brakes were assisted by a mechanical servo driven by the engine patented by Hispano-Suiza and built by Rolls-Royce under licence. Wire wheels of 17 inch diameter were fitted, with the spokes usually covered by removable discs. A built in hydraulic jacking system was fitted operated by a lever under the passenger seat.\n\nCars based on the Wraith chassis could reach ; this was very dependent on the weight and style of body fitted. In one test by \"The Motor\" magazine in October 1938, a 0–50 mph time of 16.4 seconds was recorded.\n\nIn 1938, a typical touring car cost £1700, which included the chassis cost of £1100. 492 chassis were made. Although chassis were only produced in 1939, cars bearing 1940 or later delivery and registration dates are not uncommon. Some cars were finished off during early 1940. Others were held in storage and sold and first registered during the war years. A few were actually bodied during wartime. In addition, 16 prewar chassis were bodied in early 1946 and duly delivered to the government. The final Wraith was delivered in 1947.\n\n\n"}

The mixture sets up in a cold mold and is unmolded for serving. Earlier versions, sometimes called fromage bavarois, did not include eggs.\n\nBavarian cream is a classic dessert that was included in the repertoire of chef Marie-Antoine Carême, who is sometimes credited with it. It was named in the early 19th century for Bavaria or, perhaps more likely in the history of haute cuisine, for a particularly distinguished visiting Bavarian, such as a Wittelsbach.\n\nTrue Bavarian creams first appeared in the U.S. in Boston Cooking School cookbooks, by D. A. Lincoln, 1884, and by Fannie Merritt Farmer, 1896. \"The Fannie Farmer Cookbook\" offers a \"Bavarian Cream\".\n\nBavarian cream is lightened with whipped cream when on the edge of setting up and before it is molded; a true bavarian cream is usually filled into a fluted mold, chilled until firm, then turned out onto a serving plate. By coating a chilled mold first with a fruit gelatin, a glazed effect can be produced. Imperfections in the unmolding are disguised with strategically placed fluted piping of \"crème chantilly\". In the United States, it is common to serve Bavarian Cream directly from the bowl it has been chilled in, similar to a French mousse. In this informal presentation, Escoffier recommended the bavarian cream be made in a \"timbale or deep silver dish which is then surrounded with crushed ice\".\n\nIt may be served with a fruit sauce or a raspberry or apricot purée or used to fill elaborate charlottes.\n\nThough it does not pipe smoothly because of its gelatin, it could substitute for pastry cream as a filling for doughnuts. American \"Bavarian Cream doughnuts\" are filled with a version of a crème pâtissière (pastry cream), not true \"bavarois\".\n\n\n"}

Their presence is a congenital abnormality located above the normal first rib. A cervical rib is estimated to occur in 0.2% (1 in 500 people) to 0.5% of the population. People may have a cervical rib on the right, left or both sides.\n\nMost cases of cervical ribs are not clinically relevant and do not have symptoms; cervical ribs are generally discovered incidentally. However, they vary widely in size and shape, and in rare cases, they may cause problems such as contributing to thoracic outlet syndrome, because of pressure on the nerves that may be caused by the presence of the rib.\n\nA cervical rib represents a persistent ossification of the C7 lateral costal element. During early development, this ossified costal element typically becomes re-absorbed. Failure of this process results in a variably elongated transverse process or complete rib that can be anteriorly fused with the T1 first rib below.\n\nOn imaging, cervical ribs can be distinguished because their transverse processes are directed inferolaterally, whereas those of the adjacent thoracic spine are directed anterolaterally.\n\nThe presence of a cervical rib can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery. These structures become encroached upon by the cervical rib and scalene muscles.\n\nCompression of the brachial plexus may be identified by weakness of the muscles around the muscles in the hand, near the base of the thumb. Compression of the subclavian artery is often diagnosed by finding a positive Adson's sign on examination, where the radial pulse in the arm is lost during abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. A positive Adson's sign is non-specific for the presence of a cervical rib however, as many individuals without a cervical rib will have a positive test.\n\nMany vertebrates, especially reptiles, have cervical ribs as a normal part of their anatomy rather than a pathological condition. Some sauropods had exceptionally long cervical ribs; those of \"Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis\" were nearly 4 meters long.\n\nIn birds, the cervical ribs are small and completely fused to the vertebrae.\n\nIn mammals the ventral parts of the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae are the fused-on cervical ribs.\n\nRecent studies have also found a high percent of cervical ribs in woolly mammoths. It is believed that the decline in mammoth numbers may have forced inbreeding within the species which in turn had increased the number of mammoths being born with cervical ribs. Cervical ribs have been connected with leukaemia in human children, so it has given scientists new evidence to believe that the mammoth's extinction was attributed to the condition.\n"}

It was invented by Lesley Gracey ,a Yorkshire native, who was hired by William Grant & Sons to work in new liquid development for some of their products. A decade later she was tasked with creating a new super-premium gin In addition to the traditional juniper infusion, Hendrick's uses Bulgarian rose and cucumber to add flavour. Hendrick's gin is bottled in a dark brown, apothecary-style bottle.\n\nHendrick's uses a blend of spirits produced from a Carter-Head Still (constructed in 1948), of which there are only a few in the world, and a small pot still, built in 1860 by Bennett, Sons & Shears. Both have been restored to working order after being bought at auction in the 1960s by the former William Grant Life President, Charles Gordon. The two stills produce strikingly different styles of gin due to their different construction and methods of distillation. \n\nThe pot still is generally referred to as the Bennett still. The still is quite small, which allows most of the botanical flavour characteristics to pass into the spirit. The still is filled with neutral spirit, and the botanical recipe added with some water. This is left to steep for 24 hours, which begins the process of extracting the flavour from the botanicals. The still is then heated by an external steam jacket to boil the liquid. As the pot begins to boil, vapours move up the short column of the still to the condenser, where they condense and are collected. First runnings can be as high as 92% alcohol, with a gradual decrease in the strength as the distillation progresses. Once all of the alcohol is collected, the final spirit will be approximately 75% alcohol v/v. This spirit is heavy, oily, and smells strongly of juniper.\n\nIn contrast, the spirit derived from the Carter-Head still is much subtler with light floral and sweet fragrances. Its method of production is quite different, with only the neutral spirit and water added to the pot. All botanicals used with the Carter-Head are added to a flavour basket at the very top of the still. Rather than boiling the botanicals, which produces the strong pungent spirit of the Bennett still, the Carter-Head bathes the botanicals in the alcohol vapours only. As these rise up through the still, they enter the base of the botanicals basket. Inside, the botanicals are contained in copper baskets, which hold them together while allowing the vapours to be fully exposed. As the evaporated alcohol moves through the botanicals, it efficiently extracts their flavours, which are carried out of the basket along with the alcohol until they reach the condenser. Only the lighter, sweeter and floral flavours can be extracted by this method, which gives the spirit its distinctive character.\n\nThe final Hendrick's gin is a blend of these two spirits, with an addition of cucumber essence and rose petal essence.\n\nHendrick's suggests that the gin be served with tonic water over ice garnished with cucumber instead of the traditional citrus. Hendrick’s Gin’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie, suggests an alternative serving, in which the gin is mixed with soda water and elderflower cordial.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World\" in 2003. Other spirit ratings organisations generally have been very complimentary as well. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition, for example, awarded two double gold, two gold, and three silver medals between 2005 and 2012. The Beverage Testing Institute gave the gin well-above-average scores of 93, 94 and 95 between 2007 and 2011.\n\n"}

Whipped cream is often sweetened and sometimes flavored with vanilla. Whipped cream is also called Chantilly cream or crème chantilly ().\n\nWhipped cream is a culinary colloid produced when heavy cream is subjected to mechanical aeration. Air is incorporated into cream containing at least 35% fat by one of two processes: mechanical agitation with a high-speed blade or whip, or injecting a gas under high pressure, which expands rapidly when released from pressurized containment.\n\nDuring whipping, partially coalesced fat molecules create a stabilized network which traps air bubbles. The resulting colloid is roughly double the volume of the original cream. If, however, the whipping is continued, the fat droplets will stick together destroying the colloid and forming butter. Lower-fat cream (or milk) does not whip well, while higher-fat cream produces a more stable foam.\n\nCream is usually whipped with a whisk, an electric or hand mixer, or a food processor. Results are best when the equipment and ingredients are cold.\n\nWhipped cream is often flavored with sugar, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, orange, and so on. Many 19th-century recipes recommend adding gum tragacanth to stabilize whipped cream; a few include whipped egg whites. Various other substances, including gelatin and diphosphate (E450), are used in commercial stabilizers.\n\nWhipped cream may also be made in a whipping siphon, typically using nitrous oxide as the gas, as carbon dioxide tends to give a sour taste (\"cf.\" soda syphon). The siphon may have replaceable cartridges or be sold as a pre-pressurized retail package. The gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure, and when the pressure is released, produces bubbles and thus whipped cream.\n\nWhipped cream, often sweetened and aromatised, was popular in the 16th century, with recipes in the writings of Cristoforo di Messisbugo (Ferrara, 1549), Bartolomeo Scappi (Rome, 1570), and Lancelot de Casteau (Liège, 1604). It was called milk or cream snow (\"neve di latte\", \"neige de lait\", \"neige de crème\"). A 1545 English recipe, \"A Dyschefull of Snow\", includes whipped egg whites as well, and is flavored with rosewater and sugar. (\"cf.\" snow cream) In these recipes, and until the end of the 19th century, naturally separated cream is whipped, typically with willow or rush branches, and the resulting foam on the surface would from time to time be skimmed off and drained, a process taking an hour or more. By the end of the 19th century, centrifuge-separated, high-fat cream made it much faster and easier to make whipped cream.\nThe French name \"crème fouettée\" 'whipped cream' is attested in 1629, and the English name \"whipped cream\" in 1673. The name \"snow cream\" continued to be used in the 17th century.\nVarious desserts consisting of whipped cream in pyramidal shapes with coffee, liqueurs, chocolate, fruits, and so on either in the mixture or poured on top were called \"crème en mousse\" 'cream in a foam', \"crème fouettée\", \"crème mousseuse\" 'foamy cream', \"mousse\" 'foam', and \"fromage à la Chantilly\" 'Chantilly-style molded cream', as early as 1768. Modern mousses, including mousse au chocolat, are a continuation of this tradition.\n\nCream whipped in a whipping siphon with nitrous oxide was invented in the 1930s by both Charles Getz, working with G. Frederick Smith, and Marshall Reinecke. Both filed patents, which were later litigated. The Getz patents were originally deemed invalid, but were upheld on appeal.\n\n\"Crème Chantilly\" is another name for whipped cream. The difference between \"whipped cream\" and \"crème Chantilly\" is not systematic. Some authors distinguish between the two, with crème Chantilly being sweetened, and whipped cream not. However, most authors treat the two as synonyms, with both being sweetened, neither being sweetened, or treating sweetening as optional. Many authors use only one of the two names (for the sweetened or unsweetened version), so it is not clear if they distinguish the two.\n\nThe invention of crème Chantilly is often credited incorrectly, and without evidence, to François Vatel, \"maître d'hôtel\" at the Château de Chantilly in the mid-17th century. But the name Chantilly is first connected with whipped cream in the mid-18th century, around the time that the Baronne d'Oberkirch praised the \"cream\" served at a lunch at the Hameau de Chantilly—but did not say what exactly it was, or call it Chantilly cream.\n\nThe names \"crème Chantilly\", \"crème de Chantilly\", \"crème à la Chantilly\", or \"crème fouettée à la Chantilly\" only become common in the 19th century. In 1806, the first edition of Viard's \"Cuisinier Impérial\" mentions neither \"whipped\" nor \"Chantilly\" cream, but the 1820 edition mentions both.\n\nThe name \"Chantilly\" was probably used because the château had become a symbol of refined food.\n\nImitations of whipped cream, often sold under the name whipped topping or squirty cream, are commercially available. They may be used for various reasons:\n\nWhipped topping normally contains some mixture of partially hydrogenated oil, sweeteners, water, and stabilizers and emulsifiers added to prevent syneresis, similar to margarine instead of the butter fat in the cream used in whipped cream.\n\nSee also artificial cream.\n\nWhipped cream or \"crème Chantilly\" is a popular topping for fruit and desserts such as pie, ice cream (especially sundaes), cupcakes, cakes, milkshakes, waffles, hot chocolate, cheesecakes, Jello and puddings. It is also served on coffee, especially in the Viennese coffee house tradition, where coffee with whipped cream is known as \"Melange mit Schlagobers\". Whipped cream is used as an ingredient in many desserts, for example as a filling for profiteroles and layer cakes.\n\nIt is often piped onto a dish using a pastry bag to create decorative shapes.\n"}

The product comes in four flavours: Mint, Toffee, Raisin and Orange. The Orange and Mint varieties are made of a fondant centre with a dark chocolate covering, while the Strawberry fondant and other varieties have a milk chocolate coating. During 2009, ten million Poppets were consumed each week.\n\nPoppets are best known for their iconic packaging in small, 40 gram, cardboard boxes. When other confectionery moved to plastic wrappers in the 1960s and 1970s, Poppets retained their traditional boxes. The box has a small hatch in one corner that can be torn open to dispense the sweets one at a time, this 'popping out' having given them their original name. The non-rustling packaging, and the ability to dispense single sweets in the dark, made them a popular snack in cinemas which remain one of their most popular sales outlets. The box was redesigned in 2006 with new printed designs, themed with other British design icons such as the Mini and a NatWest Piggy Bank. While 150 gram sharing sized bags can now be bought, Poppets remain best known for their box.\n\nGeorge Payne & Co. began production in the East End of London, before moving to Croydon Road, Croydon in the 1930s.

Its origin is told by the legend of Lang Liêu, a prince of the last king of the Sixth Hùng Dynasty, who became the successor thanks to his creation of \"bánh chưng\" and \"bánh giầy\", which symbolized, respectively, the Earth and the Sky (bánh chưng is the Earth and bánh giầy is the Sky). Considered an essential element of the family altar on the occasion of \"tết\", the making and eating of \"bánh chưng\" during this time is a well-preserved tradition of Vietnamese people. Beside the \"tết\" holiday, \"bánh chưng\" is also eaten all year round as Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nAccording to the book \"Lĩnh Nam chích quái\" (\"Extraordinary stories of Lĩnh Nam\") published in 1695, the creation of \"bánh chưng\" was credited to Lang Liêu, a prince of the last sixth hùng king of the hùng dynasty (c. 1712 - 1632 BC). It was said that in choosing a successor among his sons, the monarch decided to carry out a competition in which each prince brought a delicacy representing the sincerity for the ancestors on the occasion of the \"tết\", whoever could introduce the most delicious dish for the altar would become the next ruler of the country. While other princes tried to find the rare and delicious foods from forest and sea, the eighteenth prince, Lang Liêu, who was the poorest son of the Hùng king, could not afford such luxurious dishes and had to be content with everyday ingredients, such as rice and pork. Finally, he created one cake in the square form of earth called \"bánh chưng\" and one in the round form of sky called \"bánh giầy\" from these simple ingredients. In tasting the dishes offered by his son, the Hùng king found \"bánh chưng\" and \"bánh giầy\" not only delicious but also a fine representation of the respect for ancestors. Therefore, he decided to cede the throne to Lang Liêu and \"bánh chưng\", \"bánh giầy\" became traditional foods during the \"tết\". Lang Liêu founded the Seventh Hùng dynasty (c. 1631 - 1432 BC).\n\nConsidered an indispensable dish of the Tết, bánh chưng is placed in the family altars in order to honor the ancestors and pray them to support the family in the new year. Wrapped in a green square package, bánh chưng symbolizes the Earth, the variant ingredients of bánh chưng which comes from all the products of nature also emphasize the meaning of bánh chưng with Vietnamese people.\n\nThe required ingredients of bánh chưng are glutinous rice, mung bean, fatty pork and black pepper, salt, sometimes green onion, and nước mắm for spices. In the wrapping stage, one needs lá dong, strings split from giang, one type of bamboo which has long node, and sometimes a square mold in wood so that bánh chưng can be wrapped in a better shape, lá dong, which is popular only in the Southern Asia, can be substituted by banana leaves or even lá bàng. Lá dong and giang strings have to be washed carefully in order to preserve the taste of the cake, giang strings may be soaked in salt water or steamed so that they can become flexible enough for wrapping. People often choose high quality rice and bean for making bánh chưng, they are soaked in water for 2 hours in case of mung bean and 12 to 14 hours in case of glutinous rice. The fat and lean pork is preferred for bánh chưng because its fatty flavour well associates with the glutinous rice and mung bean. After being sliced in big parts, pork is mixed with pepper, onion and salt or nước mắm. People in Bắc Ninh once added sugar in this mixture of spices.\n\nThe cake is wrapped in the following order. Firstly the giang strings and two lá dong leaves are placed as the square base for the bánh chưng. After that, glutinous rice is stuffed in lá dong, followed by mung bean, pork and finally another layer of rice so that bean and pork can be respectively in the center of the cake. All placed ingredients are carefully wrapped in lá dong and bound by giang strings in the square form. In order to get a near perfect square-shaped cake, the maker can use a mold of square form as the base for the wrapping. To keep the cake from mold or being spoiled, bánh chưng should be carefully wrapped as tight as possible.\n\nThe prepared cakes are tightly arranged in large pot, the pot is filled with fresh water and boiled for hours until they are done from the inside stuffing to outside. After cooling and unwrapping, the rice skin of bánh chưng turns green because rice has absorbed the colour of lá dong. One bánh chưng is often divided in 8 parts, usually by using the very giang string which bound the wrap of the cake. As a cake formed from several ingredients, the taste of bánh chưng varies from part to part with different flavours of glutinous rice, pork, bean and even the wrapping lá dong. Bánh chưng is often served with pickled onions or vegetables, chả lụa and nước mắm. After unwrapping, bánh chưng can stay good for several days while a wrapped one can be kept for two weeks. Bánh chưng has the water activity value a of about 0.95 and its pH is approximately 6.4.\n\nBánh chưng is always considered an essential element of a traditional Tết, which is described by a popular couplet:\n\nWomen wear áo dài for their tradition.Traditionally, bánh chưng requires a preparation of many ingredients, each Vietnamese family which can afford such a preparation begins to make the cake from the 27th or 28th day of the December (tháng Chạp) in Lunar calendar. In making bánh chưng, all members of the family gather with different tasks, from washing the lá dong, mixing the pork with spices, preparing the mung bean and most important wrapping all ingredients in square form and boilling the cakes. Bánh chưng needs to be carefully boiled for ten to twelve hours during which the adults and children sit together around the boiling cauldron. In the countryside, to ensure that bánh chưng is available for every families even the poor ones, a fund called \"họ bánh chưng\" is jointly set up and about one month before the Tết, the accumulated capital and benefit are divided between members of the fund so that they can have enough money to prepare bánh chưng.\n\nNowadays, the tradition of self-made bánh chưng gradually declines in Vietnam when the size of a typical family is smaller and people do not have enough time for the preparation and making of bánh chưng, instead they go to the bánh chưng shop or order cakes in advance from families which specialize in making them. Therefore, bánh chưng still appears in each family during the Tết but they are not a family product any more. With the shift of bánh chưng making from family to specialized manufacturers, some craft villages became famous for their reputation in making bánh chưng such as Tranh Khúc village or Duyên Hà village both in Thanh Trì, Hanoi.\n\nEach year, on the occasion of the Death anniversary of the Hung Kings, a competition of making bánh chưng and bánh dày is often organized in Hùng Temple, Phú Thọ. Participants from eight different regions including Lào Cai, Hanoi and Cần Thơ are provided with 5 kg of glutinous rice, bean, 1 kg of pork so that they can make 10 bánh chưng in 10 minutes, the product of the winning team will be present in the official altar of the festival. In 2005, bánh chưng makers in Ho Chi Minh City offered Hùng Temple a pair of giant bánh chưng and bánh giầy, the size of the bánh chưng was 1.8m x 1.8m x 0.7m and 2 tonnes in weight after cooking, it was made in Ho Chi Minh City and subsequently transferred to Phú Thọ.\n\nWhile being normally eaten warm or at room temperature, bánh chưng may be also fried up and served in form of crisp pancake called bánh chưng chiên\n(fried bánh chưng). The writer Vũ Bằng in his book \"Thương nhớ mười hai\" (Longing of the 12 months) mentioned bánh chưng rán as a delicious dish during the cold February of Hanoi. In some regions, instead of bánh chưng, people make bánh tét which is a cylindrical cake with almost the same ingredients as bánh chưng. A similar cake as bánh tét is made in some regions in the North but with the name bánh tày or bánh chưng dài (long bánh chưng). Bánh tày is often made with small quantity of mung bean and little or no pork so that it can be preserved for a longer period, bánh tày can be cut in slices and fried like bánh chưng rán. San Diu people has another variation of the long bánh chưng with a hump in the middle of the cake, hence it is called bánh chưng \"gù\" (\"humped\" bánh chưng), besides lá dong, bánh chưng \"gù\" is wrapped by an additional type of leaf named lá chít.\n\nThere are also variations of bánh chưng for vegetarians and Buddhists which do not contain pork such as bánh chưng chay (vegetarian chưng cake) or bánh chưng ngọt (sweeten chưng cake), instead of pork, these cakes are stuffed with molasses or brown sugar. For these variations, sometimes they mix glutinous rice with gac so that the cake can have a red skin which is more appetizing. In the countryside, bánh chưng chay was once made by the poor families who could not afford the pork for stuffing, they replaced pork by cardamom, black pepper and cooked mung bean, this type of bánh chưng was eaten with molasses.\n\n"}

It is commonly eaten as a breakfast food during the Jewish holiday of Passover.\n\nThe German word \"brei\" refers to a \"porridge-like mush\". In modern Yiddish, \"brei\" means \"fry\".\n\nGil Marks in his \"Encyclopedia of Jewish Food\" asserts that matzah brei as a fried matzah-and-egg dish originated in North America. He notes the publication of a recipe for \"Fried Matzos\", consisting of soaked whole matzah fried in butter or schmaltz, in \"The Jewish Manual\" (London, 1846). However, egg-based recipes began to be published in early Jewish-American cookbooks, including \"Aunt Babette's\" (1889 edition) and \"The Settlement Cook Book\" (1901). These early recipes called for whole matzahs or large, broken pieces of matzah to be dipped in beaten egg and then fried. Marks credits the development of matzah brei – in which crumbled pieces of matzah and beaten egg are combined before frying – to the influence of Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the United States. Marks adds that the introduction of machine-made matzah produced \"a slightly thicker and flakier matzah than that made by hand\", and is the ideal type of matzah to use for this dish.\n\nThere are numerous ways to prepare the dish, as well as flexibility in ingredients. The basic ingredients are matzah, eggs, and a \"softening\" liquid for the matzah, such as hot water or milk. Typically the dry matzah is broken into pieces, briefly softened in water or milk, mixed with beaten eggs, and fried in a skillet. The frying is done with oil or butter. Alternately, the matzah is crumbled and then combined with beaten egg. The matzah and egg mixture may be scrambled, set to cook like a pancake, or fried like a tortilla.\n\nMatzah brei can be made savory or sweet. Savory recipes add salt, pepper, onions, or sauerkraut to the matzah and egg, and the mixture may be fried in schmaltz. Sweet recipes add honey, cinnamon, cheese, or fruit to the matzah and egg. The cooked dish is often topped with any of the following: jam, honey, cinnamon and sugar, syrup, applesauce, sour cream, yogurt, salt and pepper, or garlic powder.\n\nMatzah brei is commonly eaten as a breakfast food during Passover by Ashkenazi Jews. However, Hasidic Jews do not eat matzah brei or any other dish cooked with matzah during Passover due to the stringency against eating \"gebrochts\", matzah that has come into contact with water. Those who avoid eating \"gebrochts\" will eat matzah brei and other cooked matzah dishes on the eighth day of Passover outside the Land of Israel, as the eighth day is of rabbinic and not Torah origin.\n\n\n"}

Typically, the steak is seared in a hot skillet with a small amount of butter and oil. The steak is seared at a high temperature to cook the outside quickly and form the crust while leaving the interior rare to medium-rare.

The origins of the activity go back to the 1952 playoffs, when a National Hockey League team played two best-of-seven series to capture the Stanley Cup. Having eight arms, the octopus symbolized the number of playoff wins necessary for the Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup. The practice started April 15, 1952, when Pete and Jerry Cusimano, brothers and storeowners in Detroit's Eastern Market, hurled an octopus into the rink of The Old Red Barn. The team swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens en route to winning the championship. \n\nSince 1952, the practice has persisted with each passing year. In one 1995 game, fans threw 36 octopuses, including a specimen weighing . The Red Wings' unofficial mascot is a purple octopus named Al, and during playoff runs, two of these mascots were also hung from the rafters of Joe Louis Arena, symbolizing the 16 wins now needed to take home the Stanley Cup. The practice has become such an accepted part of the team's lore, fans have developed various techniques and \"octopus etiquette\" for launching the creatures onto the ice.\n\nThe octopus tradition has launched several other creature and object tossing moments:\n\nDuring Game 3 of the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals between the Detroit Red Wings and the New Jersey Devils, Devils fans threw a lobster, a dead fish, and other objects onto the ice.\n\nIn the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, during the opening-round series between the Wings and the Edmonton Oilers, an Edmonton radio host suggested throwing Alberta Beef on the ice before the game. Oilers fans continued throwing steaks, even at away games, resulting in several arrests at the away cities.\n\nIn the 2002–03 season, the Nashville Predators fans began throwing catfish onto their home ice in response to the Red Wings tradition. The first recorded instance occurred on October 26, 2002 in a game between the Red Wings and the Predators. Jessica Hanley, who helps clean the ice in the Gaylord Entertainment Center, told the press: \"They are so gross. They're huge, they're heavy, they stink and they leave this slimy trail on the ice. But, hey, if it's good for the team, I guess we can deal with it.\" This tradition continued in Game 3 of the 2008 Western Conference Quarterfinals matchup between the Detroit Red Wings and the Nashville Predators when Predator fans threw four catfish onto the ice.\n\nDuring Game 4 of the 2007 Stanley Cup Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the San Jose Sharks, a Sharks fan threw a 3-foot leopard shark onto the ice at the HP Pavilion at San Jose after the Sharks scored their first goal with 2 minutes left in the first period.\n\nDuring the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, in which the Red Wings defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, seafood wholesalers in Pittsburgh, led by Wholey's Fish Market, began requiring identification from customers who purchased octopuses, refusing to sell to buyers from Michigan. This also took place in the lead up to the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals with markets refusing to sell catfish to Tennessee residents.\n\nIn Game 1 of the 2010 Western Conference Quarterfinals between the Detroit Red Wings and the Phoenix Coyotes, a rubber snake was thrown onto the ice after a goal by the Coyotes' Keith Yandle.\n\nIn Game 2 of the 2010 Western Conference Semifinals between the Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks, a small shark was tossed onto the ice with an octopus inside its mouth.\n\nIn Game 3 of the 2017 Western Conference Finals between the Anaheim Ducks and the Nashville Predators, a Predators fan threw a skinned duck on the ice. \n\nIn Game 1 of the 2017 Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Nashville Predators, a fan threw a catfish on the ice in the second period, and was escorted out of the arena.\n\nAl Sobotka, the head ice manager at Little Caesars Arena and one of the two Zamboni drivers, is the person who retrieves the thrown octopuses from the ice. When the Red Wings played at Joe Louis Arena, he was known to twirl an octopus above his head as he walked across the ice rink to the Zamboni entrance. On April 19, 2008, NHL director of hockey operations Colin Campbell sent the Red Wings a memo that forbade Zamboni drivers from cleaning up any octopuses thrown onto the ice and imposed a $10,000 fine for violating the mandate. The linesmen were instead instructed to perform any clean-up duties. In an email to the \"Detroit Free Press\", NHL spokesman Frank Brown justified the ban because \"matter flies off the octopus and gets on the ice\" when Sobotka swings it above his head. In an article describing the effects of the new rule, the \"Detroit Free Press\" dubbed the NHL's prohibition as \"Octopus-gate\". By the beginning of the third round of the 2008 Playoffs, the NHL loosened the ban to allow for the octopus twirling to take place at the Zamboni entrance.\n\n"}

Cuento may specifically refer to folk tales, a category of folklore that includes stories passed down through oral tradition. The word \"cuento\" may also be used as a verb to say \"tell\", as if you are \"telling\" a story (\"Cuento\"). \n\nIdioms using this word, translated into English, include:\n\nLatin American tales are unique in that they may represent a time before European invasion, and they may combine those traditions with the history and culture that arrived post-conquest. When the Spaniards came to Latin America in the 16th century, the indigenous people were forced to assimilate their culture with the Europeans'. Likewise, the content of the stories differed between the ages. However, there are few resources on cuentos for pre-conquest indigenous peoples in South America. A folklorist specializing in Spain and Spanish-originated folklore, Aurelio M. Espinosa discovered that \"most of the Spanish folklore which is found today in the Spanish-speaking countries of America is of traditional Spanish origin\". Pre-conquest information can only be found in what is left; this includes archaeological artifacts, sculpture and pottery, stories engraved in bone, shell, and stones, and codices. Only seventeen codices are intact, \"fifteen of which are known to predate the Colonial era, and two of which originated either before the Conquest or very soon after\". \n\nWith the knowledge that the natives in Latin America were made to blend culturally with the Spaniards when they arrived, the similarity of Latin American stories to Spanish stories must be considered. Terrence L. Hansen, a Latin American folklorist, attempted to index 1,747 folktales into 659 indexes such as \"animal tales,\" \"magic tales,\" \"religious tales,\" and \"jokes and anecdotes.\" The purpose of the study was to make \"accessible to folklorists both the individual types and the broad picture of the folktale in a large part of Spanish America\".\n\nRalph S. Boggs, a folklorist who studied Spanish and other European folktales, also compiled an index of tales across ten nations, one of these nations Spain. Hansen notes that in Boggs' \"A Comparative Survey of the Folktales of Ten Peoples\", Spain also had a large number of animal tales, pointing out the \"marked interest in such tales in Spain and in Spanish America\"; however, he indicates that Boggs' study showed Spain with a much lower percent of magic tales. After several such comparisons showing very close similarities as well as almost-opposite differences, he concluded that the index-analysis should be conducted for the other Spanish-speaking parts of the Americas before any explicit conclusions can be made about folktales in Latin America. Whether or not Latin American folktales should be compared to Spanish folktales as if they were a subcategory was not mentioned in the article; however, with differences in religion, tradition, history and other such elements that can turn a story into an entirely new direction, it is possible that folklorists will regard Latin American tales unique to Spanish tales in the future.\n\n"}

{"id": "4772308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4772308", "title": "Kati roll", "text": "Kati roll\n\nA kati roll (sometimes spelt kathi roll; ) is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, India. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of \"kati roll\". Today, mostly any wrap containing a filling enfolded in an Indian flatbread (roti) is called a \"kati roll\". In native Bengali, the word Kati roughly translates to \"Stick\", referring to how they were originally made. In Bengal though, the delicacy is simply known as \"roll\". Kati Rolls normally contain coriander chutney, egg and chicken but the types may vary.\n\nThe \"kati roll\" is said to have started its life in the Nizam Restaurant in Kolkata, a popular eatery founded in 1932. There are many stories about how exactly the roll got started. Some suggest that hurried office commuters wanted something quick and portable to eat, some mention British babus who were too fastidious to touch the kabab. The most likely origin is probably more mundane, but in any case someone decided to roll things up at some point. Nizam enjoyed a virtual monopoly over this method of serving kababs for decades, but it eventually became commonplace in Kolkata and later spread elsewhere.\nThe \"kati\" part of the name came later. Like everyone else in India, Nizam's used iron skewers to make their kababs; they were easy to maintain and lasted a lifetime. However, as Nizam's popularity grew, these long heavy iron skewers became problematic; as far more was required than could be handled. In 1964, Nizam moved to bamboo skewers that were lightweight and available in large numbers. These skewers are referred to in Bengali as \"kati\" or stick, and the names \"kati kabab\" and \"kati roll\" soon stuck. The name eventually became synonymous with any kind of paratha rolled with stuffing (even when neither \"kati\" nor \"kabab\" was involved) such as the egg roll or the potato roll, and later even for other breads such as naan or roomali.\n\nIn West Bengal, shops serving rolls are mostly known as ‘Roll-er-dokaan’ and people use ‘roll’ to refer to a kati roll. Chicken roll and egg roll are two of the most common variants of \"kati roll\".\n\nTraditionally, a kati roll is a \"kati\" kebab wrapped in a layered paratha bread. Paratha is dough that is kneaded into a rope, then coiled into a round patty. It is then flattened with a rolling pin and partially fried in oil on a tawa (griddle). These semi-cooked parathas are then kept aside until needed, at which time they're put back on the tawa and cooked through. If an egg is to be added, it is usually cracked into the tawa and the paratha put on top of the egg; they both cook together and the paratha gets coated on one side with the egg.\n\nKati kababs were originally beef, and now have variations with chicken or mutton (lamb) chunks, marinated in spices and cooked on skewers (the \"kati\") over coals in a sigri. When the roll is being prepared, these are taken off the skewers and tossed with onions, chillies and sauces on the tawa, before being laid in a thin strip on the centre of the paratha (egg side up, when applicable). At this stage, most roll vendors will add various kinds of sauces, a dash of vinegar, a squeeze of lime, sometimes a shake of chaat masala and maybe some julienned carrots. The whole thing is then rolled up (originally in old newspaper) ,but now clean paper is generally used. In Kolkata, the paper usually covers only half the roll; elsewhere the paper will cover more or even all of the roll.\n\nToday, the kati roll comes in a large number of varieties. Innovations tend to be in two areas—the fillings and the wrap. Common variants on the filling are egg, potato, paneer, mixed vegetables and curried chicken or mutton. More exotic versions may have different ingredient combinations, or fancy curries such as Thai or Schezwan. In August 2012, U.S.-based fast food chain Taco Bell released a version of the kati roll in India. The \"Mexican-inspired burrito\" is a combination of a kati roll and a Kathitto.\n\nKati rolls are increasingly being seen on the menus of Indian restaurants across the country. The Kati Roll Company, founded by Payal Saha and located in New York City, is the first restaurant in the U.S. to specialize in kati rolls and is often cited as the catalyst for the rising popularity of kati rolls in the United States. In summer 2014, a Seattle (Wash.) entrepreneur started an Indian cuisine–based food truck business, Roll OK Please, which sells kati rolls and other Indian street foods in the Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond areas.\n\n"}

Paska breads are a traditional element in the easter holidays of Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Romania, Moldova, Georgia and parts of Bulgaria as well as the Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora. Due to its geographical closeness, it is also widespread in Slovakia. Meanwhile it is also eaten in countries with immigrant populations from Eastern Europe such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nEaster is called in Russian and Ukrainian languages \"па́ска\" (\"páska\"/\"Paskha\"). The word is connected to ancient Greek word \"πάσκα\" (\"páska\") and Georgian: \"პასკა\" (\"Easter\"), derived from the Orthodox believers in Byzantine Empire. The name is connected to the Jewish holiday of \"Pesach.\" \n\nPaska is made with milk, butter, eggs, flour, and sugar, except in Romania, where the recipe most commonly includes sweet cream, cottage cheese, and/or sour cream along with eggs, sugar, raisins, and rum. An egg and water mixture is used as a glaze.\n\nThe Christian faithful in many Eastern Christian countries eat this bread during Easter. Christian symbolism is associated with features of paska type breads. The inside of paska can be a swirl of yellow and white that is said to represent the resurrection of Jesus while the white represents the Holy Spirit. Other versions include chocolate, rice, or even savoury mixtures based on cheese. A version is made with maraschino cherries added to symbolize royal jewels in honor of the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nPaska is eaten with \"hrudka\", also called \"syrek\", a bland sweet custard similar to cheese made from separated eggs and milk and beets mixed with horseradish (\"chren\"/\"hrin\") and kielbasa (in Polish) or \"kovbasa\" (in Ukrainian).\n\nIn Iran and the diaspora, Assyrians will eat a Paska cake on Easter, \"Ida Gura\". The tall cake is decorated with a cross on top to represent Calvary, the place of Jesus' crucifixion, and surrounded with colored eggs to symbolize the people who visited Jesus during his death and were at his cross.\n\nPască is a traditional Romanian and Moldovan pastry. Pască is composed with eggs, sour cream, fresh cheese like urdă, raisins and sugar, and is especially made for Easter. The word \"Pască\" come from Latin, \"Pascha\", meaning \"Easter\".\n\n"}

The short end may be sold to a film dealer who will resell it to productions who are in a position to use it.\n\nShort ends most commonly occur either when the film left in the camera magazine is shorter than the amount expected to be required for the next take or at the end of a shooting day when all of the day's exposed footage needs to be sent to the film lab. When this occurs, the clapper loader will break the roll at the loop protruding from the magazine; the exposed footage is placed in a black bag inside a film can, sealed, and labeled for film processing, while the unused short end will be placed in another black bag in a film can which is then sealed and identified by length, type, which original roll it came from, and when it was unloaded.\n\nIdentification is critical, as there will be no other way to know what exactly is inside the can. Short ends cans should also be sealed in either white or colored gaffer tape, depending on what (if any) color scheme is being used to identify film types; in any case, black gaffer tape should not be used, as it is considered the standard tape color used to seal exposed cans. Alternatively, in the event that the footage will be needed very shortly, the short end may not leave the magazine in the first place, but rather be freshly threaded through the magazine as if it were a new roll.\n\nIf the entire roll has remained unshot and is to be unloaded back into a can, this is technically not considered a short end, but rather a re-can. Additionally, if the unshot footage is going to be thrown away almost immediately, then this is considered waste footage. Short ends only exist if there is both enough unexposed film left in the magazine to warrant using it to start a new magazine load and also if there is either a magazine or a film can available to store it in the interim. Otherwise, the film may have to be wasted if there is nowhere it can be kept safely away from any light. Short ends may exist for a number of reasons, but usually they are either created at the end of a shooting day when the exposed film is unloaded to be sent with the day's rushes or at the end of a film shoot when there is still film left in the magazine on the movie camera. Additionally, particular film stock types might only have been used for a few scenes and thus have considerable short end lengths at the conclusion of their usage.\n\nShort end minimum lengths vary depending on the needs of a production; professional productions usually will prefer to waste any quantities less than 100 to 200 feet rather than constantly interrupt shooting to reload so often, while lower budget or student productions may be eager to use any amounts greater than 20 or 30 feet. In any case, the minimum length needs to be substantial enough to allow for the magazine to be loaded, the camera to be laced, and something to be usably shot, which usually will require at least ten feet prior to the shot. The maximum length of a short end will be anything close the full length of a roll without counting as a re-can.\n\nShort ends are considered distinct from fresh new rolls because they may have been subject to environmental conditions since leaving their originally sealed can and are no longer under factory warranty, and are generally identified distinctly to avoid any confusion in the matter. Assuming proper storage and fast turnaround time, they are considered perfectly usable. Older short ends or ones of uncertain provenance should be clip tested first to check their condition. Re-cans and short ends are often sold at discounts to lower budget productions by labs, larger production companies, or businesses which specialize in their sale.\n\n"}

{"id": "4784413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4784413", "title": "Matran family of Shamizdin", "text": "Matran family of Shamizdin\n\nMatran is an Assyrian word for Metropolitan or Archbishop. The 'Metropolitans of Shamizdin' based at the Mar Ishu Monastery in the area of Nochiya in south east Turkey, have always been known by their hereditary title of Mar Khnanishu. History records that there were at least 12 Metropolitans of Shamizdin since 1580 but the first two were not related to the \"Gida\" line and were actually loyal to the Pope.\n\nThe Matran family jointly controlled the ‘Assyrian Church of the East’ for 314 years. \n\nFew realize that between 1553–1661 for a period of 108 years, this branch of today's ‘Assyrian Church of the East’ became known as ‘\"The Chaldean Catholic Church\"’ and was loyal to the Pope. Some historians label this era as the ‘Jilu period’, as three of the last five Catholic Patriarchs were from the Jilu Tribe.\n\nIn 1661, the bishops of this ‘Chaldean Church’ revolted against union with Rome and deposed Mar Yualla Shimun XII of Jilu. The following year in 1662, a new Patriarch was chosen Mar Dinkha Shimun XIII, who was a bishop and Patriarch in waiting (Nadtir Kursi) of the old Nestorian Church of Alqosh (the rival church) and a member of the Patriarchal and Dynastical ‘\"Aboona family\"’. Mar Dinkha was the first in the line of Quchanis Patriarchs, known as the Mar Shimuns.\n\nOf course, the Dynastical Aboona family were dictatorial to the extreme, they insisted that both Patriarchs of the two Churches and the Metropolitans, Bishops, Monks, Archdeacons and Priests all be chosen from the ‘Aboona family’. So, a year after his own consecration, Mar Shimun XIII went about consecrating his first cousin Mar Sargis Khnanishu I as 'Metropolitan of Rustaqa for Shamizdin' in 1663, this made him the second most powerful man in the church and the Patriarch's right hand man. They re-introduced hereditary succession within the Church hierarchy and jointly controlled Assyrian Church affairs for a period of 312 years.\n\nThis period often referred to as the ‘Qudshanis era' and is most famous for two things namely; restoring independence from Rome and re-labeling the ‘Chaldean’ identity to the ‘Assyrian’ as it is known today. Their joint destiny came to an end when both distant cousins died in the mid-1970s.\n\nMar Sargis Khnanishu I was from the Gida House of 'Daireh & Komaneh' (Iraq) and may have originated from the town of Hazza in Arbil.\n\nSometime in the mid 17th century, there were 3 brothers (who were priests) by the names of Sargis, Kharsu and Hanna, from the Gida Family who lived in the village of 'Daireh & Komaneh' possibly in the Mar Odishu monastery near Amedia (Iraq). Sargis may very well have been a monk.\n\nMar Dinkha Shimon XIII, better known as Dinkha Qatula (The Killer), killed his nephew Mar Khnanishu over rights of succession to the Patriarchal throne of the Nestorian church in Alqush and fled to Salamas to the Church based in Hakkari.\n\nHis cousins, the 3 brothers fled to the village of Alheh in the Nerwa region (Iraq) for a period of seven years. From Alheh, Hanna went to Jarma in Margawar (Iran) and Sargis & Kharsu went to the village of Sararu in Shamizdin.\n\nIn 1663, when the new Patriarch was looking to consecrate a Metropolitan for his new Church, he summoned the 3 brothers to travel to his residence at Khosrawa in the district of Salamas to consecrate one of them as Archbishop of the Church of The East. The story goes that Hanna from Jarma although was a priest, did not feel qualified enough to enter the race. The other two brothers however, set out to the Patriarchal residency through snowy winter conditions.\n\nAs fortune would have it, only Sargis managed the tough journey to his cousin the Patriarch and was consequently consecrated Matran, while Kharsu failed to complete the tough journey. Apparently, Mar Shimun the Patriarch announced, “Since, the other 2 brothers could not make the hazardous journey, it must then be God who has chosen you Sargis, to be the Metropolitan of this new Church”, so he moved from the village of Sararu to the close-by monastery of Mar Ishu to take charge of the 'Rustaqa diocese'.\n\nThe seat of Metropolitan remained in the Gida House until 1977, with the last Matran being the Saint Mar Yosip Khnanishu X. Since obviously, Metropolitans don’t marry, the seat was passed down from uncle to nephew. The second Metropolitan of Shamizdin must have been Kharsu’s son and so on, until the 10th and last of the Gida House. No one is quite sure why they called them The Gidas, whether Gida was the father of Mar Sargis and so being the uncle of Mar Shimon, or indeed whether Gida was actually a village or the name of a church somewhere, the name issue remains unsolved.\n\nThroughout history, the Metropolitans of this house have been known for performing miracles. There are numerous tales that abound concerning Mar Iskhaq and Mar Yosip and indeed other members of the family's astonishing gift of mystasim and healing. The Church of the East finally realized this in the 1980s and consecrated Mar Yosip Khnanishu as an official Saint of the Assyrian Church and introduced a special feast dedicated to him in their annual calendar.\n\nToday, the Matran family are still revered and are always addressed by their tribe as ‘\"Jani\"’, a kurdish word meaning 'my life'. Currently they don’t have a Metropolitan bishop in the family, however Nenif Matran Hariri is most active in internal tribal affairs.\n\nThere were two other bishops in Nochiya; Mar Dinkha of Tees and Mar Yukhanan of Dariyan.\n\nIt is often said, that both these Bishopric families stemmed from the Matran family. Sometimes when the Matran family had extra Nazarited (\"Nzereh\") priests in the family, they would be made bishops for surrounding areas.\n\nIn any case, it would be inconceivable to think that any new bishops would be consecrated after 1663 for the Shamizdin area that were not from the Gida fold, the Matran family just would not accept them, because it would mean in turn that they were not related to the Mar Shimun family and that would simply be out of the question, they had to be somehow related to the famous \"Aboona Dynasty\".\n\nThe last Mar Youkhanan died in Diyana in the 1970s, however Mar Dinkha IV of Tees went on to become the current Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. So, it seems the Gida family might still be controlling the Assyrian Church of the East. Finally, the Mar Yukhanan family maybe planning to re-introduce the bishopery by choosing a son to take his forefather’s place. Whether the Mar Dinkha IV family choose to continue their hereditary privilege is yet to be seen. While the Matran family have dedicated a newborn son to be ‘Guardian of the Chair’ (\"Nadtir Kursi\") to the Mar Khnanishu XI throne, his name is Bawa the son of Nenif Matran Hariri who will lead the life of a Nazarite (\"Nzera\"), just like his father’s granduncle.\n\n\n"}

The earliest known use of \"crostata\" in its modern sense can be traced to the cookbooks \"Libro de Arte Coquinaria\" (Book of the Art of Cooking) by Martino da Como, published circa 1465, and \"Cuoco napolitano\" (Neapolitan Cook), published in the late 15th century containing a recipe (number 94) titled \"Crostata de Caso, Pane, etc.\".\n\nA crostata is a \"rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart\" that may also be baked in a pie plate.\n\nHistorically, it also referred to an \"open-faced sandwich or canapé\" because of its crusted appearance, or a \"chewet\", a type of meat pie.\n\nThe name derives from the Latin word \"crustāta\", the feminine past participle of \"crustāre\" (to encrust), and ultimately from the noun \"crusta\" (crust). The French term \"croustade\" derives from it, from which the English term \"custard\" derives. The word \"crostata\" appeared in the earliest Italian dictionaries, included in the 1612 dictionary \"Vocabolario degli accademici della Crusca\" (compiled from 1591-1608) by the Accademia della Crusca and the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, and the 1617 dictionary \"Il memoriale della lingua italiana: ridotto in ordine d'alfabeto per commodità del lettore\" by Giacomo Pergamino, in which it was defined as a type of \"torta\".\n\nTraditionally, a crostata consisted of a base, usually three layers, of friable dough \"flavoured with clarified fat and butter\". Today, shortcrust pastry is used instead. It is differentiated from a \"torta\" by its filling: a crostata has an inconsistent chunky filling, whereas a \"torta\" has a consistent filling made of blended ingredients. There are \"endless variations\" of both sweet and savoury crostata, the sweet ones usually being served as a dessert.\n\nSweet variations use fruit preserves as a filling, typically apricot, cherry, peach or nectarine, or berries. The crostata can also be blind-baked and then filled with pastry cream (\"crema pasticciera\") topped with pieces of fresh fruit; this is called \"crostata di frutta\". In his 1570 cookbook \"Opera dell'arte del cucinare\", Bartolomeo Scappi included a recipe for a crostata of plums and sour cherries, and others for quince, and pears. A modern version is \"crostata alla nutella\", which has Nutella as the filling.\n\nIngredients for a savoury crostata may include meat, fish, or vegetables, which are pre-cooked. \"Opera dell'arte del cucinare\" included a recipe for a \"crostata of crabmeat and shrimp\", and also stated that to instead make a \"torta\", the shrimp and crab should be crushed. A popular sweet variant, especially in central Italy, is \"crostata di ricotta\", made with ricotta mixed with sugar and lemon zest, and which may additionally include cocoa or raisins.\n\nScappi included many recipes for crostata in \"Opera dell'arte del cucinare\". For meat and seafood based crostata, there were recipes using pork jowls or prosciutto, crayfish, anchovies, or oysters. Other savoury crostata recipes included a crostata with creamy cheese referred to as a \"butirata\", those with truffles or field mushrooms, one with artichoke or cardoon hearts, and one with \"the viscera of any sort of turtle\".\n"}

The name of this dish comes from the Gujarati word \"undhu\", which translates to upside down, since the dish is traditionally cooked upside down underground in earthen pots, termed \"matlu\", which are fired from above.\n\nThe dish is a seasonal one, comprising the vegetables that are available on the South Gujarat coastline, including the Surat, Navsari and Valsad regions, during the winter, including (amongst others) green beans or new peas (typically used along with the tender pod), unripe banana, small eggplants, muthia (dumplings/fritters made with fenugreek leaves and spiced chickpea flour (\"besan\") or \"handva no lot\", and either steamed or fried), potatoes, and purple yam, and sometimes plantain. These are spiced with a dry curry paste that typically includes cilantro leaves, ginger, garlic, green chili pepper, sugar and sometimes includes freshly grated coconut. The mixture is slow cooked for a long time, with some vegetable oil and a very small amount of water sufficient to steam the root vegetables.\n\nThe finished preparation is dry: individual chunks of vegetables are coated with a thin layer of spice and oil but retain their shape: the contents of the dish must therefore be stirred relatively infrequently during the cooking. Crisp vegetables such as bean pods must ideally retain a little of their crunchy texture. To ensure that no individual component is overcooked, the vegetables may need to be cooked in stages: the root vegetables and eggplant are half-cooked before adding the quick-cooking bean pods and ripe plantain. The finished dish is garnished with chopped cilantro leaf and lemon or lime juice before serving.\n\n\"Surti undhiyu\" is a variant that is served with puri at weddings and banquets. Again it is a mixed vegetable casserole, made with red lentils and seasoned with spices, grated coconut, and palm sugar in a mild sauce. It is garnished with chopped peanuts and toasted grated coconut, and served with rice.\n\nUndhiyu with puri and shrikhand is often eaten in Gujarati houses during the winter.\n\nThe theme of cooking the seasonal winter vegetables into a stew is common across the Indian subcontinent and around the world.

The 1979 Bob Marley concert at Western Springs Stadium is credited with having a huge influence of the growth of reggae in the country and inspiring many prominent reggae artists. The growth of the Rastafarian religion, particularly among Māori, was also a factor in the growth of the genre, and the high rates of use of marijuana among New Zealanders is likely to have had an influence. Reggae topped the charts in New Zealand in the early 1980s when Toots and the Maytals, the first artist to use the term “reggae” in song, went platinum with their song “Beautiful Woman”. \n\nThe reggae scene is centred around the Waikato, Whanganui and the capital Wellington, with capital music having a more dub and jazz influenced sound.

It can also be any gift given by someone arriving from a distant place.\n\n\"Pasalubong\" are also associated with the \"balikbayan\", Overseas Filipinos returning to the Philippines, and may refer to items that migrant workers bring home to their families, friends, relatives or even non-relatives that they feel especially close with.\n\n\"Pasalubong\" is a Tagalog word, a variant of the word \"pansalubong\" or \"pangsalubong\". It comes from the root word \"\"salubong\"\" which means \"(to) welcome\", \"to meet\", or \"reception\". The prefix \"\"pa-\"\" is a contraction of \"pang-\", roughly equivalent to the English suffix \"\"-er\"\". Thus, the word \"pasalubong\" can be roughly translated as \"something meant for you when you welcome me back.\" The word has minor celebratory connotations, as in rejoicing the safe homecoming of someone who was away for a time.\n\nIn Visayan languages, \"pasalubong\" is also referred to as \"tinabuan\" in Cebuano and \"sinugatan\" in Hiligaynon. Both of which have the same meanings as the Tagalog word. The Philippine English acronym B.H. (for \"Bring Home\") is also frequently used.\n\n\"Pasalubong\", in general, is a \"gift for a relation or friend brought by a traveler returning from a trip,\" and could also refer to \"anything given as a gift to someone on the way home to a certain place.\" It could also mean \"homecoming gift\" or any present which signifies appreciation to the services rendered by the recipient.\n\nThe \"pasalubong\" usually consists of native delicacies or indigenous things from the region or country where the traveler came from. For example, a vacationer coming back from Negros might bring home some \"piaya\" to his family, while someone coming home from Hawaii might bring macadamia nuts. The length of time the person is away is inconsequential. A \"pasalubong\" can be given coming home from work each day to returning to one's hometown after decades of being in another country.\n\nThe tradition of giving a \"pasalubong\" is of great cultural importance for Filipinos as it strengthens the bond with the immediate family, relatives, and friends. In rarer instances, it can even be used to forge stronger relationships with someone you may not know that well, as with someone you may be meeting for the first time.\n\nThe gesture of handing out \"pasalubong\" emphasizes the gladness at reuniting with one's loved ones and the relief at being back home safe. It is also a sign of thoughtfulness. While \"pasalubong\" are not compulsory or even expected, failing to bring \"pasalubong\" for someone can sometimes be perceived negatively. Particular importance is given to gifts for children, and the anticipation of getting \"pasalubong\" from a parent coming home is often a cherished childhood memory for most Filipinos.\n\nBy bringing gifts with regional significance (e.g. things that cannot be acquired locally), the person coming home can also share part of his travels. It similar to the western concept of souvenirs except that it is not meant for personal remembrance but for sharing the experience with others, especially as the different islands and regions of the Philippines can have different languages, local customs, and cuisine specialties. The \"pasalubong\" serves as a 'sample' of another region's specialty, bringing different Filipino cultures closer together. They can also simply be gifts likely to be appreciated.\n\nUnlike western gifts, \"pasalubong\" are not wrapped, but are given as is. The person who gives the \"pasalubong\" can also freely partake of the gift.\n\nVarious regions in the Philippines have their own specialties in food, handicrafts, and the like. These are promoted to local tourists via the \"pasalubong\" custom. It is not unusual for bus stops to have stalls nearby which sell the specialty \"pasalubong\" of the respective regions they are located in.\n\nFor instance \"binagol\", made with sweetened mashed giant taro called \"talian\" and packed in half of a leaf-covered coconut shell, is a popular \"pasalubong\" from the Eastern Visayas region and has its roots from the town of Dagami, Leyte. Dagami-on, as the townsfolk are known, would bring this \"pasalubong\" whenever they travel back to, say, Manila or abroad. A person traveling to Davao City may bring back durian, while another visiting Cebu might buy \"utap\". Those who went to Bacolod will bring back piaya, napoleones and pinasugbo (Negrense banana fritters). Guimaras offers sweet mangoes and mango-based delicacies and food products as pasalubong.\n\nThey don't always have to be regionally significant, however. \"Pasalubong\" can range from ordinary sweets (like chocolates), regional delicacies, to imported confectionery goods. They can also be other items like clothing, accessories, novelty items, ornaments, handicraft items, artwork, and toys, among others. They can even be ordinary things that may be hard to acquire in a given region.\n\n\"Pasalubong\" can be as mundane as fast-food take-outs, toys, snacks or fruit given to children below 10 years of age by a parent coming home from work. It can also be as exotic as a balikbayan box filled with gifts from a foreign country; it is an adaptation of the idea of the \"pasalubong\" for the Filipino diaspora. Unlike traditional \"pasalubong\", these are not usually given in person but are sent by air freight.\n\n"}

Individual loaves are shaped by rolling the dough into long logs (\"bastón\") which are rolled in fine bread crumbs. These are then portioned, allowed to rise, and baked. \n\nIt is most commonly served hot and consumed by dipping in coffee or hot chocolate drink. It can also be complemented with butter (or margarine), cheese, jam, or peanut butter. For some areas in the Philippines, they included malunggay leaves as part of its main ingredient. They call it \"malunggay pandesal.\" \n\nIts taste and texture closely resemble those of the Puerto Rican bread \"pan de agua\", baguette in france, and Mexican \"bolillos\". Contrary to its name, pan de sal tastes slightly sweet rather than salty. Most of the bakeries bake pandesal in the morning for breakfast consumption.\n\nIn Siargao Island which is known for its surfing tourism, an elongated oval-shaped version of the pandesal is locally known as \"pan de surf\" due to the similarity of its shape to a surfboard. It is baked on make-shift ovens fueled with coconut husks. It is usually sold with \"pan de coco\".\n\nThe precursor of pan de sal was \"pan de suelo\" (\"floor bread\"), a local Spanish-Filipino version of the French baguette baked directly on the floor of a wood-fired oven (a \"pugon\"). It was made with wheat flour and was harder and crustier than pan de sal. Since wheat is not natively produced in the Philippines, bakers eventually switched to more affordable inferior flour resulting in the softer, doughy texture of pan de sal.\n\nPan de sal flourished during the American Commonwealth of the Philippines in the early 1900s, when cheaper American wheat became more readily available. It has since become a staple breakfast bread in the Philippines.\n\n"}

Vegetables commonly used in avial are elephant yam, plantain, pumpkin, carrots, beans, Aubergine, cucumber, drum sticks, snake gourd and avarai, etc. are the recent introduction, while the north Kerala Avial includes bitter gourd also. Some people prefer to skip curd or substitute it with raw mango or tamarind pulp. This dish can be made into a gravy or be made into a semi-solid side dish. It is generally eaten with rice. The word \"avial\" is also used to denote 'boiled' or 'cooked in water' — this sense being derived from the way the dish is made.\n\nIt is supposed to have been invented by Bhima (one of the Pandava brothers) during their exile. According to the legend, when Ballav (Bhima's name during this time) assumed his duties as the cook in the kitchen of Virata, he did not know how to cook. One of the first things he did was to chop up many different vegetables, boil them together and top the dish with grated coconut.\nThere are mythological variations. Bheema is said to have prepared Avial, when there were unexpected guests for King Virata and he needed to serve meals for them. There were no sufficient vegetables to cook any single recipe for a side dish, so Bheema used whatever available vegetables to make a new dish, which came to be known as Avial.\n\nAnother narrative version relates to the attempt made by Kauravas to kill Bhima. After poisoning Bhima, Kauravas tied Bhima and threw him to water. Kauravas also communicated that they saw Bhima drowning in water. With the completion of the days of mourning, a funeral feast was planned and preparation were underway. Unexpectedly, Bhima emerged from the water, rescued by the Nagas. With this, preparations for the feast was cancelled. However, Bhima was unhappy with this decision, and decided to mix all of the vegetables to prepare a new dish, that later became popular as Avial.\nAnother myth that in the kingdom of thiruvithankor in Kerala there was a great fest held by the king. Every one in the kingdom came to eat so there was a shortage of curry to be served. But in the kitchen also stocks were less so when the king visited the kitchen he found that a lot of vegetables were wasted when they were peeled. The king ordered the cook to make a curry with this along with some other ingredients so Avial was born. The king also ordered it to be served as the first item. Hence Avial is the first to be served on a Sadhya. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "4883403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4883403", "title": "Marron glacé", "text": "Marron glacé\n\nA marron glacé (plural \"marrons glacés\") is a confection, originating in northern Italy and southern France consisting of a chestnut candied in sugar syrup and glazed. Marrons glacés are an ingredient in many desserts and are also eaten on their own.\n\nCandied chestnuts appeared in chestnut-growing areas in northern Italy and southern France shortly after the crusaders returned to Europe with sugar. Cooking with sugar allowed creation of new confectioneries. A candied chestnut confection was probably served around the beginning of the 15th century in Piedmont, among other places. But \"marrons glacés\" as such (with the last touch of 'glazing'), may have been created only in the 16th century. Lyon and Cuneo dispute the title for the addition of the glazing, or icing, that makes the real \"marron glacé\".\n\nThe earliest known records of a recipe for marron glacés were written during the XVI century by an Italian cook that worked for Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy [1580], and by the French at the end of 17th century in Louis XIV's Versailles court. In 1667, François Pierre La Varenne, ten years' chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, Marquis of Uxelles (near Lyon and a chestnut-producing area), and foremost figure of the nouvelle cuisine movement of the time, published his best-selling book \"Le parfaict confiturier\". In it he describes \"la façon de faire marron pour tirer au sec\" (\"the way to make (a) chestnut (so as) to 'pull it dry'\"); this may well be the first record of the recipe for marrons glacés. \"Tirer au sec\" means, in a confectionery context, \"to remove (what's being candied) from the syrup\". La Varenne's book was edited thirty times over seventy-five years.\n\nNevertheless, that book was not mentioned (nor indeed any other) when the recipe, applied to cocoa beans, was in 1694 passed on to Jean-Baptiste Labat, a French missionary in the Martinique. That year Father Labat wrote in a letter of a recipe for candied and iced cocoa beans which he had tasted when dining at a M. Pocquet's. Another early citation, still in French, is from 1690.\n\nTowards the end of 19th century, Lyon was suffering from the collapse of the textile market, notably silk. In the midst of this crisis, Clément Faugier, a bridge and roadworks engineer, was looking for a way to revitalize the regional economy. In 1882 in Privas, Ardèche, he and a local confectioner set up the first factory with the technology to produce marrons glacés industrially (though many of the nearly twenty steps necessary from harvest to finished product are still performed manually). Three years later he introduced the \"crème de marrons de l'Ardèche\", a sweetened chestnut purée made from marrons glacés broken during the production process, flavoured with vanilla. (later came \"Marrons au Cognac\" in 1924, \"Purée de Marrons Nature\" in 1934, \"Marrons au Naturel\" in 1951, and \"Marpom's\" in 1994.)\n\nThe same process was used by José Posada in Ourense (Spain) in 1980. He was the first businessman in Spain to build a factory to produce Spanish marrons glacés using Galician raw chestnuts, which previously were exported to France to produce the confectionary. Posada used the French and Italian formula to produce the marrons glacés. Today, there are two factories that produce marrons glacés in Spain.\n\nThe French refer to chestnuts as \"châtaigne\" or \"marron\". Both terms refer to the fruit of the sweet chestnut \"Castanea sativa\". However, \"marron\" tends to denote a higher quality, larger fruit that is more easily peeled. The fifth edition of the dictionary \"Dictionnaire de l'Académie française. Revu, corrigé et augmenté\" published in 1798 states that a \"marron glacé\" is a confit marron that is covered in caramel. The 1767 book \"L'agronome, ou dictionnaire portatif du cultivateur\" claimed that the best marrons came from the Dauphiné region in southeastern France, and contained instructions for preparing marron glacés.\n\nChestnuts are covered with a membrane, known as a pellicle or episperm, which closely adheres to the fruit's flesh and must be removed because of its astringency. Marron nuts have a pellicle which is \"superficially attached to the nut\", making it easily removable from the fruit. Some chestnuts have two cotyledons usually separated with deep grooves penetrating nearly all the way through the fruit; this makes them too fragile for the necessary manipulations during the cooking process. There also are other grooves on the surface, which means more embedded pellicle that must be painstakingly removed. \"Marron\"-quality nuts do not have the separation into two cotyledons; it appears in one piece and it shows few very shallow grooves.\n\nIn Italy, the term \"marron\" denotes a specific high-quality cultivar of \"Castanea sativa\" bearing oblong fruits with a shiny, reddish epicarp and often exhibiting a small rectangular hilar scar. As with the French use of the term, there should be no division of the cotyledons.\n\nMarron-quality nuts for \"marrons glacés\" may be three or four times more expensive than the \"châtaigne\" because they also have a lower yield as the husk usually contains only one or two nuts and the plants have sterile male flowers.\n\n\"Marrons glacés\" may be eaten on their own.\n\n\"Crème de marrons\" are a staple ingredient for other desserts, such as the Mont Blanc (puréed with cream), ice creams, cakes, sweet sauce or garnish for other desserts.\n\nIn the short story \"Reginald\" (1901) by Saki, the narrator leaves Reginald \"near a seductive dish of marrons glacés\" at a garden-party in the vain hope that these delicacies will distract him from wreaking social havoc.\n\nIn the Overture to \"Swann's Way\", Marcel Proust refers to M. Swann bringing to Marcel's great-aunt on New Year's Day a little packet of marrons glacés.\n\nIn Patrick Skene Catling's children's book, \"The Chocolate Touch\", marrons glacés are among the candies listed as the sweet-toothed young protagonist's favorite confectionary delights.\n\nIn the 1899 novel \"The Awakening\" by Kate Chopin, on a comfortable night Edna Pontellier dines alone, she describes marrons glacé as \"just what she wanted\".\n\nIn the 1936 film \"Camille\", Greta Garbo's character asks for \"sweets\", and Robert Taylor's character goes to some trouble to find fresh marrons glacés for her.\n\nIn the British television drama series \"Victoria\", Queen Victoria played by Jenna Coleman repeated calls marrons glacés her \"favourite\".\n\nCandied chestnuts are a speciality of Bursa, Turkey, where they are called \"kestane șekeri\" 'chestnut candy'.\n\n"}

In any case, \"Brown Windsor soup became shorthand for awful food,\" and was used as a prop by comics in the post-war years.\n\nIt is unclear whether this often-written-about soup is of Victorian origin. The food writer Alan Davidson in \"The Oxford Companion to Food\" (2006) refers to an elaborate late Victorian recipe in Garrett's \"Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery\" from 1890, although Davidson does not make clear if Garrett's recipe is for a \"Brown\" Windsor Soup. The earliest known cases of \"Brown Windsor soup\" are found in restaurant menus published as advertisements in newspapers during the 1920s and 1930s. Examples include Cadena Cafes (Portsmouth) which advertised \"Soup - Tomato or Brown Windsor\" on its menu dated 24 February 1926. Bobby's of Queens Road (Bristol) advertised \"Potage Brown Windsor\" (under the \"soup\" heading) on its menu dated 13 February 1931. The Scottish department store Isaac Benzie advertised \"Brown Windsor Soup\" in a menu published 14 December 1933.\n\nDespite the soup being documented in restaurant menus during the interwar years, some more recent web sources incorrectly claim there are no references to \"Brown Windsor soup\" prior to a joke mention, or invention, in the 1953 Ealing Studios film comedy \"The Captain's Paradise\". Another associates it with \"Calves' Feet Soup à la Windsor\", created for the \"post-natal Queen Victoria\" by Charles Elmé Francatelli, her chef. Etymologist Michael Quinion incorrectly reports the earliest known reference is from 1943, in \"The Fancy\", by Monica Dickens. \n\nAs to the name, a few early White Windsor soup recipes included the use of Windsor fava beans (broad beans), perhaps the origin of the name. Quinion adds that fictional barrister Rumpole of the Bailey mentioned eating it on the Great Western Railway in a book of short stories dated 1978 although Quinion questions whether this is an endorsement of the soup, \"the extract confirms that the soup was at one time a staple of the restaurant menus of British Railways.\" Dr Malcolm Timperley, a researcher in the National Railway Museum's library and archives, reports that their team has specifically researched the existence of brown Windsor soup in British dining cars. After checking scores of menus dating back to the nineteenth century they failed to find any mention of it.\n\nDespite its disputed origins, there are many recipes, and they often reassert or embellish the supposed myth.\n\nBritish magazine \"The Poke\" advertised a satirical can of Brown Windsor soup as part of a \"Jubilee Collection,\" available for about ₤40, complete with Silver spoon and reportedly made \"directly from the sewage outflow of Windsor Castle.\" Brown Windsor soup is identified in the film \"Carry On Regardless\" (1961) by Kenneth Connor as the dish he is splashed with having knocked over a waiter's tray on a train and in \"Carry On Abroad\" (1972) by Kenneth Williams in a scene in a restaurant, where the soup is mistakenly referred to as 'Brown Bristols' by the Spanish hotel manager, played by Peter Butterworth . In an episode, titled The Macreekie Rising of '74, of The Goon Show, Brown Windsor soup is used as a weapon and mocked as \"deficient in calories\" by the impressively stout Neddy Seagoon.\nIn Hancock's Half Hour, episode \"Air Crew Only\", the in-flight meal starts with \"Brown Windsor soup just burnt enough to leave that attractive brown ring sticking round the edge of the plate\" \nIn Agatha Christie's Poirot, episode \"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\", Poirot laments to a waiter that the Brown Windsor soup he has been served \"doesn't look very... \"delicieux\"\".

People eat it plain, and often use it as an ingredient in salads, soups, and other dishes.\n\nFarro is an ethnobotanical term derived from Italian Latin for a group of three wheat species: spelt (\"Triticum spelta\"), emmer (\"Triticum dicoccum\"), and einkorn (\"Triticum monococcum\"), which are all types of hulled wheat (wheat that cannot be threshed). In Italian cuisine, the farro species are sometimes distinguished as \"farro grande,\" \"farro medio,\" and \"farro piccolo,\" respectively. Confusion is generated by the difficult history in the taxonomy of wheat and the colloquial, regional use of the term for specific wheat species; for example, emmer grown in the Garfagnana region of Tuscany is known as farro, and can receive an Indicazione Geografica Protetta (IGP) designation which, by law, guarantees its geographic origin. Emmer is by far the most common variety grown in Italy, in certain mountain regions of Tuscany and Abruzzo. It is also considered higher quality for cooking than the other two grains, and is sometimes called \"true\" farro. Farro is also sometimes referred to inaccurately as \"spelt\" in English (\"Dinkel\" in German), specifically distinguished from both emmer and einkorn.\n\nRegional differences in what is grown locally and eaten as farro, as well as similarities between the three grains, may explain the confusion. Some English-speakers now assume \"farro\" refers to steamed or boiled grain presented as salad and similar dishes, rather than to the grain itself (which can also be milled and made into bread or pasta). Spelt is much more commonly grown in Germany and Switzerland, where people use it in much the same way, and might therefore be called farro, as is \"épeautre\" (French for spelt) in France (where, like for farro in Italy, \"petit\", \"moyen\", and \"grand épeautre\" is grown).\n\nThe Italian word \"farro\" derives from the presumed Latin word \"farrum\", from Standard Latin \"far, farris n\". : a kind of wheat (as in farina (food)). \"Far\", in turn, derives from the Indo-European root \"*bʰar-es-\" : (spelt), which also gave rise to the English word barley, Albanian \"bar\" : grass, Old Church Slavonic брашьно (\"brašĭno\") : flour, and Greek Φήρον (\"phḗron\"): plant deity.\n\nThe three species are sometimes known as \"farro piccolo\", \"farro medio,\" and \"farro grande,\" which are einkorn, emmer, and spelt, respectively. While these names reflect the general size difference between these three grains, some landraces of each overlap into the typical size range of the others.\n\n"}

The word meaning have nothing to do with any Sanskrit origin as some believe. This rare phenomenon is observed only along the coastal waters of the Indian state of Kerala, especially around the coast of Purakkad and in South America, where it has proved to be a boon for the local fisherfolk.\n\nA correct scientific explanation about the formation of a chakara is debatable. However, a strongly supported theory is that during the monsoons, the water level of the backwaters rises which facilitates the movement of fine clay particles into the sea through the subterranean channels. The accumulation of organic material by this process in relatively calm regions of the sea during the monsoons attracts fish.\n\nThis phenomenon is demonstrated in the malayalam film Chemmeen. It is greeted, celebrated, and described in the song \"Puththan Valakkare.\"\n\nThe same phenomenon in Tulu regions is known as \"Palke\"\n\n"}

This pastry is usually found filled with savory ingredients, but can also have a sweet filling.\n\nThe pastry and its catchy name \"vol-au-vent\" are sometimes credited to Antonin Carême. However, an entremet called \"petits gâteaux vole au vent\" is mentioned in François Marin's 1739 cookbook \"Les Dons de Comus\", years before Carême's birth.\n\nIn France, it is usually served as an appetizer or a small snack, filled with chicken or fish. In Belgium, it is a common main dish that can be found on the menus of most restaurants, and is nearly always filled with a combination of chicken, mushrooms, and small meatballs, served with either mashed potatoes or fries.

Despite it generically meaning \"small piece of paper\", the word is now widely used to refer to small slips of paper that the Sicilian Mafia uses for high-level communications.\n\nSicilian Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano is among those best known for using \"pizzini\", most notably in his instruction that Matteo Messina Denaro become his successor. The pizzini of other mafiosi have significantly aided police investigations.\n\nProvenzano used a version of the Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar in wartime communications. The Caesar code involves shifting each letter of the alphabet forward three places; Provenzano's \"pizzini\" code did the same, then replaced letters with numbers indicating their position in the alphabet. Thus \"mia\" might become \"16124\", since m=13+3=16, i=9+3=12, and a=1+3=4. (Note that the alphabet used is the Italian alphabet, which has a slightly different order and number of characters than the Latin alphabet.) It is a very simple and old code, with the only point of difficulty being the initial confusion of the ambiguous role of the various digits as independent or part of two-digit numbers.\n\nFor example, one reported note by Provenzano read \"I met 512151522 191212154 and we agreed that we will see each other after the holidays...\" This name was decoded as \"Binnu Riina\".\n\nDiscovery Channel News quotes cryptography expert Bruce Schneier saying \"Looks like kindergarten cryptography to me. It will keep your kid sister out, but it won't keep the police out. But what do you expect from someone who is computer illiterate?\"\n\nItalian police got a chance to read many \"pizzini\" when close associates of Provenzano turned informant. Once in possession of enough \"pizzini\", police were able to break the code quickly.\n\nA biographer of Provenzano also reports that Provenzano used a more complicated code, yet to be deciphered, which referenced selected words that Provenzano had underlined in his copy of the Bible.\n\n"}

In Tunisia it the term refers to a very popular chickpea based breakfast soup which also includes egg and stale bread.\n\nChickpeas used for leblebi are selected for shape, size, color, and harvesting time, and vary by cultivar. Generally, large-seeded (8 –9 mm in diameter and 30.0 –50.0 g of 100 kernel weight ), lighter-colored, round, and smooth surfaced \"Kabuli\" chickpeas are preferred; a thick seed coat and hull, easy to remove from the kernel is requisite. Harvesting time determines the tempering process and quality of leblebi; chickpeas are cleaned and classified by size, with undeveloped, damaged, shrunken, and broken chickpeas discarded.\n\nThere are two different kinds of leblebi- \"dehulled leblebi\" (Sarı Leblebi and Girit Leblebi) and \"nondehulled leblebi\" (Beyaz Leblebi and Sakız Leblebi) -introduced from Anatolia to North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and some parts of Asia by Turks. Production ranges from Turkey to the Middle East. In Turkey, the primary leblebi-producing region is Çorum, with a few additional local varieties such as \"Ağın Leblebi\", çorum \"Leblebi\", and Mardin \"Leblebi\".\n\nRecord of the origins of leblebi are scarce, though it is thought to date back to 1000–1500 CE in Iran.\n\nThe methods of leblebi production are an inherited tradition, with the steps and the equipment used varying. Utensils generally include tools for cleaning, grading, and heating, with preparation as follows:\n\n\nLeblebi may have come from the Arabic word \"leblab\" (), referring to \"Lablab\", a domesticated pulse with edible beans – thus 'leblebi' means 'made from leblab' – or from the Persian \"leb\" (لب), meaning lip, and suffix \"-i\", 'of lips'.\n\nRoasted chickpeas are a popular snack in Iran and throughout the Middle East, Greece (), Sicily, India and Pakistan.\n\nOttoman composer Dikran Tchouhadjian (1837–1898) composed an operetta titled \"Leblebidji Hor-Hor Agha\" (The Chickpea Vendor) in 1875.\n\n\n"}

The most common version resembles an oversized hand with an extended index finger, and slits in their bases allow them to be worn over the hands. Usually the surface displays a silk-screened team name, logo, or other graphic or slogan, such as \"We Are #1.\" Foam hands are made of open-celled foam.\n\nThe first prototype foam finger was created in 1971 by Ottumwa High School student Steve Chmelar, who constructed a giant hand out of hardware cloth and papier-mâché for the 1971 Iowa High School Athletic Association Boy's State Basketball Finals, between the Ottumwa Bulldogs and the Davenport West Falcons. A senior in high school, Steve's photo was taken by the Associated Press and published in the Des Moines Tribune and the 1971 Ottumwa High School class yearbook, the \"Argus\", in Ottumwa, Iowa.\n\nIn 1976, Texas high school teacher Geral Fauss created foam fingers to show support for the team at the high school where he taught, to raise funds for the industrial arts club, and as a project that his industrial arts class could produce themselves. His first prototype foam finger was actually made out of plywood and had a painting of a \"number one\" done in the school's colors.\n\nFauss first sold his foam fingers at the 1978 Cotton Bowl in Dallas (University of Texas vs. Notre Dame), and he later went on to found Spirit Industries for the large scale manufacturing of foam fingers. In 1979, the first polyurethane foam version of the product was produced by Spirit Industries.\n\n\nBesides being sold at all manner of sporting events and venues as souvenirs, foam fingers are used as fund-raisers for schools and booster clubs as well as corporate promotions.\n\nTo date, the majority of \"foam hands\" have been produced in a planar-like form. However, in early 2009, a product that more-closely replicates the dimensional form of a human hand (like Hulk Hands with an extended finger) was introduced and marketed under the trade name Radhand until 2010 when it was renamed UltimateHand, produced by a new company called BrettHand.\n\n"}

It is currently sold and marketed by the Dad's Root Beer Company LLC, and owned by Hedinger Brands, LLC.\n\nDad's Root Beer was developed in the 1930s by partners Barney Berns and Ely Klapman in the basement of Klapman's Chicago-area home. The first trademark registration was filed on September 24, 1938, granted on February 14, 1939, to the Dad's Root Beer Company of Chicago, with the product name allegedly in use since February 1937. Dad's earned a loyal following. Dad's Root Beer brand was famous throughout the Midwest and by the late 1940s, was one of the most consumed brands of root beer throughout the United States. Jules Klapman, son of co-founder Ely, successfully took the Dad's brand international. The name Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer was selected in honor of Ely Klapman's father, and other fathers, who used to make root beer at home for their families (popular in the early 20th Century).\n\nDad's Root Beer was the first product to use the six pack format invented by the Atlanta Paper Company in the 1940s. Dad's also introduced the half-gallon bottle, becoming the first brand to market this size. Dad's was marketed as a family. \"Junior\" bottle size was the smallest, 7, 10 or 12 ounces. \"Mama\" was a quart bottle, and \"Papa\" was a half gallon bottle. (The image of the young boy featured on the \"Junior\" size bottle is Barney Berns' son, Gene Berns.) A common promotion in the 1940s was the 1 cent sale - purchase the Papa half gallon at regular price and get the Mama quart for 1 cent.\n\nThe Klapman and Berns families sold all rights to the Dad's name and logo to IC Industries in the 1970s.\n\nThe Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta acquired Dad's from IC Industries of Chicago in 1986. At that time Dad's was distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler network, sold 12 million cases annually, and held the second largest share of the root beer category behind A & W.\n\nIn 2007 Dad's Root Beer was purchased from Monarch, along with the Bubble Up, Dr. Wells, and Sun Crest brands, by Hedinger Brands, LLC and licensed to the Dad's Root Beer Company, LLC. The company headquarters is now located in Jasper, Indiana.\n\nDad's Root Beer celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2012.\n\nIn 2007, the Dad's Root Beer Company, LLC of Jasper, Indiana, was formed by Keith Hedinger when Hedinger Brands, LLC acquired the Dad's Root Beer brand and other soda brands from The Monarch Beverage Co. of Atlanta. Hedinger was approached as owner of Hedinger Beverage Distributing Co., Inc., the largest nonbottler distributor of Dad's. Other soda brands purchased by Hedinger Brands, LLC are Bubble Up, Dr. Wells, and Sun Crest. Dad's has added over 100 additional distributors since acquisition by Hedinger Brands. Jewel-Osco in Chicago, Dollar Tree, Kmart stores, Big Lots, Food City, World Market Stores, Quick Trip Phoenix, Spartan stores, Roundy's, Cub Foods, Marsh, Houchens, Family Express, and Smith's Utah are all retailers of the Dad's brand.\n\nDad's makes the following brands/flavors:\n\nThe company's signs on the Edens Expressway (I-94) and one near Lake Shore Drive asked \"Have you had it lately?\" became fixtures on the Chicago landscape. \n\nThe product's jingle was a simple line sung several times, to a conga beat, with the \"kick\" coming on \"Beer\":\n<score>\n\\addlyrics {Dad's old fash ioned root beer\n</score>\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Dad's sponsored on a regional basis the syndicated TV adventure series Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Chicago-based television advertising for Dad's featured a different jingle sung by an ensemble with the following lyrics:\n\n\"If it foams up to meet you\"\n\"It's gotta be Dad's, it's gotta be Dad's\"\n\"If it foams up to treat you\"\n\"It's gotta be Dad's, it's gotta be Dad's\"\n\n\"So ask for Dad's, it's good old-fashioned\"\n\"With the taste of yesteryear\"\n\"If you don't ask for Dad's\"\n\"All you're gonna get is,\"\n\"All you're gonna get is,\"\n\"All you're gonna get is,\"\n\"...root beer!\"\n\nDad's Root Beer became an IZOD Indycar associate sponsor in 2007 with Racing Professionals and the #19 for 3 races including the 2007 Indy 500. In 2008, Dad's joined Dreyer & Reinbold Racing as an associate sponsor of Indy 500 Champion Buddy Rice's #15 car. The distinctive blue, yellow and red Dad's Root Beer livery was unveiled that year at the 2008 season finale race at the Chicagoland Speedway.\n\nStarting in 2009, Dad's sponsored Dreyer & Reinbold Racing's #24 car in the IndyCar Series with English driver Mike Conway. Conway drove the Dad's Root Beer # 24 primary car for 7 races that year: St. Pete, Long Beach, Kansas, Iowa (on Father's Day), Watkins Glen, Kentucky and Chicago, with the highest Dad's Root Beer car finish 6th at Watkins Glen.\n\nDad's was back in 2010 as a sponsor of Conway's #24 at São Paulo, Brazil and St. Pete. The Dad's car's most notable outing came in the 2010 Indianapolis 500 when Conway's car was completely destroyed in a horrific crash on lap 199 which saw the car launch off the back tire of a car in front of it, become airborne and slam into the catch fence at . Conway survived the crash with only a broken leg. Graham Rahal filled in for Conway at Iowa on Father's Day 2010 and drove the specially designed #24 Hot Wheels/Dad's Root Beer Car.

They broadcast the last show after 6 years in November. It was announced that the team and Triple M have decided not to continue after longtime member James Brayshaw decided not to return. From 2008, comedian Peter Helliar took over the Melbourne breakfast spot with co-host Myf Warhurst. On 7 September 2009, \"The Hot Breakfast\" with Eddie McGuire took over the Melbourne breakfast slot.\n\nThe breakfast show on Triple M Brisbane is The Cage. Breakfast begins from 5:30am weekdays with The Cage with Ian Skippen, Marto, Sully and Emily Jade O'Keefe on 104.5 Triple M. In September 2011, after six years the show finished due to lackluster ratings.\n\nThe Melbourne version of The Cage was made up of Peter Berner, Brigitte Duclos, James Brayshaw, Matt Parkinson & Mike Fitzpatrick, however they were often referred to by their nicknames: \"Pete\", \"Brig\", \"JB\", \"Parko\" & \"Fitzy\" respectively.

Teams of people had to get as far away from either Sydney or Melbourne within 5 days and whoever went the furthest distance would win $5000 cash.\n\nIn February 2007, The Cage held a night of stand up comedy, \"The Cage on Stage\", to raise money for those affected by the Victorian bushfires. Comedians on the night included all the Cagers as well as Wil Anderson, Greg Fleet and Cal Wilson.\n\nIn March 2007, The Cage held an exhibition of Brig's \"meditation art\", consisting of a painting of an orange elephant, an orange lady, a brown bear and a blank canvas for the week Brig missed class. $1850 was raised at auction and donated to the Camp Quality charity.

This stimulates germination, which activates various enzymes in the rice.

It is over-consumed if left to market forces. Examples of demerit goods include tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, gambling, junk food and prostitution. Because of the nature of these goods, governments often levy taxes on these goods (specifically, sin taxes), in some cases regulating or banning consumption or advertisement of these goods.\n\nThere is an important conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a negative externality. Another example is cigarettes. It not only affects a deliberate or addicted smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke (second hand smoking). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer. \n\nTwo fundamental views in welfare economics, welfarism and paternalism, differ in their conceptual treatment of 'demerit goods'. Simply, welfarism takes the individual's \"own\" perception of the utility of a good as the final judgement of the utility of the good for that person, and thereby disallows the concept of a 'demerit good' (while allowing the analysis of negative externalities). As an extreme example, if a heroin addict purchases heroin, they must have done so because heroin makes them better off, and this transaction is viewed as a net social positive (assuming that the addict does not commit any other crimes as the result of their addiction). Paternalism, on the other hand, judges that heroin \"isn't good for you\", and feels free to override the judgement of the addicts themselves.\n\n"}

It is a thin crépe roll made from a wide strip of \"shahe fen\" (rice noodles), filled with shrimp, beef, vegetables, or other ingredients. Seasoned soy sauce -- sometimes with siu mei drippings -- is poured over the dish upon serving. When plain and made without filling, the rice noodle is also known as jyu cheung fan.\n\nThe rice noodle sheets are made from a viscous mixture of 1 cup of rice flour and 1/4 cup tapioca or glutinous rice flour and water; this recipe will scale well as long as the ratio of flours and water remain the same. The combination of both types of flour and water should be a consistency of heavy cream. The rice flour serves as the bulk and flavor of rice, the tapioca flour gives the noodle elasticity and springiness; therefore, it should never crumble nor be too chewy. It should never have the al dente texture as with Italian pasta. Boric acid is sometimes used to make it have a very smooth texture or plastic sheen. Boric acid is banned for human consumption as a food ingredient in the United States, European Union, and developing countries as it may cause kidney failure.\n\nThis liquid mixture is poured into a specially made flat pan with holes (similar to a flat colander). Commercial restaurants instead use special oversized steamers that are lined with a steam-permeable cloth. The noodle mixture is steamed in the pan from the bottom up to produce the square rice noodle sheets. The thickness of the noodle should be very thin (roughly thickness), never thick, or it will have a gummy texture.\n\nOnce the liquid mixture is ladled and set, the chef can add a filling such as shrimp or beef before the noodle is fully cooked. As the noodle is cooking, it will start to set around the filling and take hold without falling out when transferring from steamer to dish. After steaming for several minutes, the entire freshly steamed noodle is melded onto the cloth thereby the necessity to be scraped off with a scraper and onto a usually a metal table surface with a thin coat of oil to prevent sticking. The resulting freshly made noodle is lightly folded about three times. The resulting size is usually anywhere from 5 to 7 inches long by 1.5 to 2 inches wide. Traditionally, the noodles are finished with the addition of a warm, sweetened soy sauce just before serving. Cantonese/Hong Kong style \"Cheungfan\" is usually lightly folded (about 1.5 to 2 inches wide and 5 to 7 inches long) when there is filling inside, resulting in a much more pleasing look rather than a rolled up as a fruit roll up.\n\nTwo common Cantonese words are typically used to describe a well-made rice noodle roll: \"heung\" (香; \"fragrant\") and \"waat\" (滑; \"smooth\"). The actual noodle by itself doesn't have much taste, it is just as bland as plain white steamed rice. The fillings and the soy sauce that accompanies it provides the bulk of the flavor. Traditional fillings are marinated fresh or dried shrimp, beef (heavily mixed with rice flour), or pork and chopped green onions. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, presentation is very important when serving dim sum. The rice noodle, when fully cooked, should be slightly transparent to slightly reveal the filling. If the edges after folding are not lined up then the edges are to be cut to get that even look, similar to getting the outer crust cut off a sandwich. The rice noodle roll is generally served in \"threes\" and usually scored to reveal the filling inside. Most other countries will roll them plain with no filling inside and instead serve them with toppings and a heavy/thick sauce on top. The rice noodle roll is always served hot and fresh and accompanied with a splash of plain or flavored (fried shallot) oil to give it a nice sheen and aroma with a generous amount of warm sweet soy sauce added right before serving. Most establishments will have a slightly different flavor of sweet soy sauce such as an addition of hoisin sauce.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, a hugely popular street food is plain cheungfan and is often served with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame sauce and roasted sesame seeds.\n\nIn Cantonese cuisine, rice noodle roll is most often served in dim sum. The most common types traditionally offered as part of dim sum cuisine are:\n\nOther modern varieties that may be offered include:\n\nA version of cheungfan notably absent outside of Guangzhou is the sliced meat filling variety. This variety is typically found in street side restaurants as a meal in itself, and uses whole meat pieces, typically beef or pork, rather than ground meat. Prior to rolling the crepe, briefly blanched lettuce or romaine is added as part of the filling, giving the cheungfan a crunch as well as volume.\n\nThe Malaysian Penang style \"Chee cheong fun\" is served with a shrimp paste called \"hae ko\" in Hokkien dialect and \"petis udang\" in Malay language. \n\nIpoh, being another food capital of Malaysia, \"Chee cheong fun\" is mainly served in two ways, the dry or wet versions. In the 'dry version', it is served with bright red sweet sauce and in most cases, chilli sauce as well as pickled green chilli. In the 'wet version', it is served with curry with pork rind and long bean or minced meat and shiitake mushroom gravy. Both dry or wet versions are topped with sesame seeds and fried shallots.\n\nTeluk Intan, one of the town in the state of Perak, has another variations of \"Chee cheong fun\" which contain turnips, shallots and deep fried shrimps.\n\n\"Chee cheong fun\" is a popular breakfast food in Singapore and Malaysia. \"Chee cheong fun\" is frequently served in kopitiams and Chinese restaurants. \"Chee cheong fun\" can also be found in Bagansiapiapi, a small town in Riau, Indonesia. It is called \"tee long pan\" or \"tee cheong pan\" in local Hokkian dialect. \"Tee long pan\" is served with red chilli sauce, crushed roasted-peanuts, fried onions, and dried shrimp.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, there is a similar dish called \"bánh cuốn\", and it is mostly eaten for breakfast. It is a crêpe-like roll made from a thin, wide sheet of rice noodle (similar to Shahe fen) that can be filled with ground pork and other ingredients. Sides for this dish usually consist of \"chả lụa\" (Vietnamese pork sausage) and bean sprouts, while the dipping sauce is called \"nước chấm\". Sometimes, a drop of cà cuống, which is the essence of a giant water bug, \"Lethocerus indicus\", is added to the \"nước chấm\" for extra flavor, although this ingredient is scarce and quite expensive.\n\n"}

Because of the countries' historical colonial ties, \"Koeé\" (kue) is also popular in the Netherlands.\n\nIndonesian kue demonstrate local native delicacies, Chinese and Indian influences, as well as European cake and pastry influences.

The well-set and nicely decorated colourful assorted \"jajan pasar\" usually served as food gift, parcel or to accompany tumpeng (the main dish) during Javanese traditional ceremonies.\n\nThe term \"kue\" is derived from Hokkien: 粿 \"koé\". It is also spelled as \"kuih\" in Malaysian, and \"kueh\" in Singapore. Kue are more often steamed than baked, and are thus very different in texture, flavour and appearance from Western cakes or puff pastries. Many kue are sweet, but some are savoury.\n\nIndonesian kues are usually categorized according to its moisture. Roughly divided under two groups, \"kue basah\" (lit: \"wet kue\") and \"kue kering\" (lit: \"dry kue\"). In fact, the word \"kue\" in Indonesian language is used to refer to not only these kinds of traditional snack, but also all types of cake and some types of pastries. Most \"kue kering\" are technically pastries and many Western cakes can be considered as \"kue basah\".\n\nMany of the traditional Indonesian kue, either sweet or savoury, are based on rice flour and coconut. Traditionally, Indonesian sweets uses \"gula aren\" or palm sugar, yet powdered sugar or common sugar are also widely used. Rice flour and tapioca probably the most commonly used flour in Indonesian kue. However, due to foreign influences, wheat flour is commonly used. For creamy flavour and texture, traditional Indonesian cakes uses coconut milk, yet today dairy product such as milk, cream, butter, cheese and margarine are also commonly used. Popular flavouring agents and spices including coconut, peanut, green \"pandan\", ginger, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate.\n\nToday, in urban Indonesian society, an assorted choices of kue are popular snack for brunch or afternoon break to accompany coffee or tea. Various traditional kue are often being offered alongside western pastries and cakes in cafes, coffee shops, snack stalls to humble \"warung kopi\". \n\nTraditionally, kue are made prior of certain celebration or events such as \"lebaran\" or \"natal\". Indonesian households or community traditionally communally made homemade cakes for celebration and festivities. For example, Keraton Yogyakarta traditionally held \"Ngapem\" ceremony, where royal household communally cook \"kue apem\" (Javanese version of \"appam\") as a part of \"Tingalan Jumenengan Dalem\" ceremony. Nevertheless, kue is also a lucrative business, and traditionally available in traditional \"pasar pagi\" markets as \"jajan pasar\" (market buys). \n\nCertain markets are specialized on selling various kue, such as Pasar Kue Subuh in Senen Central Jakarta, that selling kue from dawn to early morning.

It is often thrown from behind—such as in the 'knockout game'—although striking from behind is not a prerequisite for a sucker punch. The term is generally used in situations where the way in which the punch has been delivered is considered unfair or unethical, and is done using deception or distraction, hence the term 'sucker' used to refer to the victim. \n\nIn boxing, a sucker punch—as is done when 'hitting on the break', for example—is illegal. For example, when James Butler knocked Richard Grant unconscious after losing a fight to him on points, his license was suspended.\n\nDuring 2013 and 2014, significant media attention was paid to two violent killings involving one-hit punches in Australia. Noting that 91 people had died in Australia in the previous four years from brain trauma as a result of being king hit, a media campaign was launched to refer to them as coward punches. This campaign was supported by the New South Wales Government. \n\nThe term \"sucker punch\" was widely discussed after the New York Jets' starting quarterback, Geno Smith, was sucker punched by a fellow player, IK Enemkpali, on August 11, 2015. The altercation was in the locker room about compensation regarding a $600 airplane ticket.\n\nThe sucker punch has been adapted into many films, video games and other forms of media. It can be used to show the antagonist's vileness, the low morals of an anti-hero, betrayal of someone close to the protagonist, etc. However, it also can be used as a weapon of the protagonist to deal with an unfair situation. A sucker punch is a major dramatic element in the 2004 film \"Million Dollar Baby\". \n\nThere are also several videos depicting sucker punches on video-sharing websites such as YouTube, however YouTube forbids such content as a violation of its Community Guidelines and are thus not supposed to be on there.\n\nAustralian soap operas \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" have covered the topic in storylines broadcast in September 2014 and October 2015 respectively.\n\nIn the Pokémon game series, a move has the English name of .

As sucker punches rely on deception they can often be anticipated using methods such as: \nSucker punches are commonly performed using either a hook-type punch, or a haymaker-type punch, as these are more damaging than straight shots due to the increased distance traveled thus enabling more time for acceleration.\n\nBecause sucker punches come unexpectedly, people at risk of such blows must be alert to the proximity of potential opponents.\n"}

However, what sets Brujería in Puerto Rico apart is the unique blend of “religiosity and spiritualized materialism”\n\nIsabelo Zenón Cruz made the assessment that Puerto Rican vernacular religions (and really any Afro-Latino religions) have been only studied by folklorists but not comparative religionists due to “classist and racist assumptions”\n\nUnlike many other Caribbean religions that derive from Africa, Brujería is not based on stable community, hierarchy, or membership. Instead, practices are more dependent on the ritual preferences of the actual participants. Because of the spontaneity of the spirits, it is impossible for institutionalized doctrines of worships to be enforced on followers and practicers of Brujería.\n\nWithin sacred altars of brujos, lessons of practitioners, and brujería rituals lies ties to African ideologies, Catholicism, and Spiritism; explaining the erasure of hierarchical order.\n\nBefore Spiritism was developed, Taíno Indians and African slaves in Puerto Rico developed the convictions that there exists spirits and those spirits can be communicated with. This becomes mixed with the convictions of spiritual worship introduced by Catholic colonizers. Early leaders of Spiritism found interest in Brujería amongst liberal, emancipation minded groups in the late nineteenth century; begging the interest for further research of the correlation between politics and Brujería.\n\nEarly Brujería can be traced back as far as the 1500s when the archbishop of Santo Domingo and fifth bishop of Puerto Rico, Nicolás Ramos, recorded his recollections of ‘black brujos [male and female] who engaged with the devil in the shape of a goat and, every night in front of this goat, cursed God, Santa María, and the sacraments of the Holy Church.’’ Ramos wrote, ‘‘[A]sserting that they did not have nor believe in a god other than that devil…they performed these rituals in some fields [apparently they were in a trance] ,…not in dreams since there were some people who saw them.’’ These people, Ramos continues, ‘‘tried to make them [the sorcerers] refrain from their doings through chanting and holy gifts [ dádivas ], and with all this [information they] came to me.’” This perpetual demonization of elements of African worship set up the forefront to the centuries of demonization of Brujería practices.\n\nFrom the sixteenth to the subsequent eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, slaves were shipped from Africa to Puerto Rico and Hispaniola and were forced to convert to Christianity by the imposing church and the overseeing \"hacendados—\"land owners. Branded slaves were baptized to be fully recognized as the property of hacendados.\n\nIn the late 1800s to early 1900s during the early days of American occupation within Cuba, there were established attacks to undermine the legitimacy of several Afro-Cuban institutions and organizations— including Brujería.\n\nWith the growth of a single Cuban identity came a greater appreciation for conformity and deviation from “creolised manifestations”. However, the declination of faith-based practices in Cuba due to the rise in Marxism from 1959 to the 1990s lead to practitioners of Afro-Cuban religions to have to find innovative ways to survive Castro’s political informants that particularly called for the suppression of witchcraft and Brujería.\n\nThe introduction of Spiritism in the twentieth century attracted more participants of all racial backgrounds: black, white, and mulatto. It also added new foundations of practice and ritualistic objects such as: santiguos (healing blessings), 19 despojos (spiritual cleansings), prayers, and spells; and an array of indigenous, medieval Catholic, and African offerings.\n\nDespite Brujería inheriting traits from Catholicism, there has been a long history of the Catholic Church demonizing Brujería, referring to it as \"evil, Satanism\", or the \"workings of the devil\". That being said, with the increasing rate of persecution amongst practitioners since colonization of the Afro-Latino Caribbean, Brujería has been forced into modernization to combat erasure.\n\nAs separatist ideals begin to gain more momentum, particularly in Puerto Rico, there becomes more clings to cultural nationalism— including clings to aspects of Afro-Boricua and Taíno folklore. Previously (1950s–1960s), journalists in the island denounced Brujería as a way to help “educate the masses”. However, the shift in cultural nationalism from the 1980s onwards now leads to media outlets uncovering “hidden traditions” of the “endangered Puerto Rican Hispanic, Taíno, and African traditions”\n\nRomberg argues the practice of modern day Brujería as \"the vernacular co-optation of discourses of interest and passions, of consumerism and spirituality, commodity fetishism and morality, and welfare capitalism and magic\". And also reveals that despite misconceptions, Brujería builds to social order through both “holistic or individualized types of intervention” and endorsement of positive “mainstream social values”.\n\nBrujería doesn’t participate in community, hierarchical, or initiation-based practice or membership. Rituals are interdependent on the procedures, practices, and attitudes passed down by its participants and heavily depend on forces of nature and the spontaneity of the spirits. Following specific guidelines and doctrines in Brujería is impossible.\n\nHowever, some commonalities include basic ritual gestures, communication during divination, possession, and specific components of altars. These similarities are often referred to as “a kind of spiritual lingua franca” which explains the ubiquity of the practice cross the Afro-Latino and Non-Afro-Latino diaspora.\n\nIn practice, brujos stress to not believe in the ritualistic objects or hold too much pertinence in the material representations of the spiritual entities, but rather focus on the messages and “powers of the entities that inhabit these icons”\n\nPower is sensed and manifested when the voices of Spiritist entities, Santería orishas, and the recently deceased are brought on by “Brujería rituals, divination, trance and the making of magic works”. The spirits abstract means of revelation include through emotions, through senses, and through healings as a means to transform the “emotional, proprioceptive and (to some extent) physiological states of participants”\n\nWhereas a lot of focus within the practice of Brujería is on the technological systems, Brujería focuses a lot on interpersonal client-patient power that “emerges during healing, divination and magic rituals challenges the assumed precondition”; specifically in regards to health, labor, family relations, and even career management.\n\nBrujos and practitioners of Brujería never question the belief of the spirits. The performative methods of surrenderance training is the only lessons brujos aim to be taught. The expectation is to have faith in the spirits and the spirits will theatrically reveal what is needed to be revealed.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5001858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5001858", "title": "Homa (ritual)", "text": "Homa (ritual)\n\nHoma is a Sanskrit word that refers to a ritual, wherein an oblation or any religious offering is made into fire. A homa is sometimes called a \"sacrifice ritual\" because the fire destroys the offering, but a homa is more accurately a \"votive ritual\". The fire is the agent, and the offerings include those that are material and symbolic such as grains, clarified butter, milk, incense and seeds.\n\nIt is rooted in the Vedic religion, and was adopted in ancient times by Buddhism and Jainism. The practice spread from India to Central Asia, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Homa rituals remain an important part of many Hindu ceremonies, and variations of homa continue to be practiced in current-day Buddhism, particularly in parts of Tibet and Japan. It is also found in modern Jainism.\n\nA homa ritual is known by alternative names, such as \"yajna\" in Hinduism which sometimes means larger public fire rituals, or \"jajnavidhana\" or \"goma\" in Buddhism. In modern times, a \"homa\" or havana tends to be a private ritual around a symbolic fire, such as those observed at a wedding.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"homa\" (होम) is from the root \"hu\", which refers to \"pouring into fire, offer, sacrifice\".\n\nHoma traditions are found all across Asia, from Samarkand to Japan, over a 3000-year history. A \"homa\", in all its Asian variations, is a ceremonial ritual that offers food to fire and is ultimately linked to the traditions contained in the Vedic religion. The tradition reflects a reverence for fire and cooked food (\"pākayajña\") that developed in Asia, and the Brahmana layers of the Vedas are the earliest records of this ritual reverence.\nThe \"yajñā\" or fire sacrifice became a distinct feature of the early \"śruti\" rituals. A \"śrauta\" ritual is a form of quid pro quo where through the fire ritual, a sacrificer offered something to the gods and goddesses, and the sacrificer expected something in return. The Vedic ritual consisted of sacrificial offerings of something edible or drinkable, such as milk, clarified butter, yoghurt, rice, barley, an animal, or anything of value, offered to the gods with the assistance of fire priests. This Vedic tradition split into śrauta (śruti-based) and Smarta (Smṛti-based).\n\nThe homa ritual practices were observed by different Buddhist and Jaina traditions, states Phyllis Granoff, with their texts appropriating the \"ritual eclecticism\" of Hindu traditions, albeit with variations that evolved through medieval times. The homa-style Vedic sacrifice ritual, states Musashi Tachikawa, was absorbed into Mahayana Buddhism and homa rituals continue to be performed in some Buddhist traditions in Tibet, China and Japan.\n\nThe homa ritual grammar is common to many sanskara (rite of passage) ceremonies in various Hindu traditions. The Vedic fire ritual, at the core of various homa ritual variations in Hinduism, is a \"bilaterally symmetrical\" structure of a rite. It often combines fire and water, burnt offerings and soma, fire as masculine, earth and water as feminine, the fire vertical and reaching upwards, while the altar, offerings and liquids being horizontal. The homa ritual's altar (fire pit) is itself a symmetry, most often a square, a design principle that is also at the heart of temples and mandapas in Indian religions. The sequence of homa ritual events similarly, from beginning to end, are structured around the principles of symmetry. The forms and means of offerings, states Michael Witzel, are symbol of the masculine and feminine, such as \"ghee\" (symbol of masculine semen) offered into the fire from a ladle ritually shaped in form of a yoni (symbolism for feminine prakṛti).\n\nThe fire-altar (\"vedi\" or homa/havan kunda) is generally made of brick or stone or a copper vessel, and is almost always built specifically for the occasion, being dismantled immediately afterwards. This fire-altar is invariably built in square shape. While very large \"vedis\" are occasionally built for major public \"homas\", the usual altar may be as small as 1 × 1 foot square and rarely exceeds 3 × 3 feet square.\n\nA ritual space of homa, the altar is temporary and movable. The first step in a homa ritual is the construction of the ritual enclosure (mandapa), and the last step is its deconstruction. The altar and mandapa is consecrated by a priest, creating a sacred space for the ritual ceremony, with recitation of mantras. With hymns sung, the fire is started, offerings collected. The sacrificer enters, symbolically cleanses himself or herself, with water, joins the homa ritual, gods invited, prayers recited, conch shell blown. The sacrificers pour offerings and libations into the fire, with hymns sung, to the sounds of \"svaha\". The oblations and offerings typically consist of clarified butter (\"ghee\"), milk, curd, sugar, saffron, grains, coconut, perfumed water, incense, seeds, petals and herbs.\n\nThe altar and the ritual is a symbolic representation of the Hindu cosmology, a link between reality and the worlds of gods and living beings. The ritual is also a symmetric exchange, a \"quid pro quo\", where humans offer something to the gods through the medium of fire, and in return expect that the gods will reciprocate with strength and that which they have power to influence.\n\nThe homa (, \"goma\") ritual of consecrated fire is found in some Buddhist traditions of Tibet, China and Japan. Its roots are the Vedic ritual, it evokes Buddhist deities, and is performed by qualified Buddhist priests. In Chinese translations of Buddhist texts such as \"Kutadanta Sutta\", \"Dighanikaya\" and \"Suttanipata\", dated to be from the 6th to 8th century, the Vedic homa practice is attributed to Buddha's endorsement along with the claim that Buddha was the original teacher of the Vedas in his previous lives.\n\nIn some Buddhist homa traditions, such as in Japan, the central deity invoked in this ritual is usually Acalanātha (Fudō Myōō 不動明王, lit. \"immovable wisdom king\"). \"Acalanātha\" is another name for the god Rudra in the Vedic tradition, for Vajrapani or \"Chakdor\" in Tibetan traditions, and of \"Sotshirvani\" in Siberia. The Acala Homa ritual procedure follows the same Vedic protocols found in Hinduism, with offerings into the fire by priests who recite mantras being the main part of the ritual and the devotees clap hands as different rounds of hymns have been recited. Other versions of the Vedic homa (\"goma\") rituals are found in the Tendai and Shingon Buddhist traditions as well as in Shugendō and Shinto in Japan.\n\nIn most Shingon temples, this ritual is performed daily in the morning or the afternoon, and is a requirement for all acharyas to learn this ritual upon entering the priesthood. The original medieval era texts of the \"goma\" rituals are in Siddham Sanskrit seed words and Chinese, with added Japanese katakana to assist the priests in proper pronunciation. Larger scale ceremonies often include multiple priests, chanting, the beating of Taiko drums and blowing of conch shell (\"horagai\") around the mandala with fire as the ceremonial focus. Homa rituals (\"sbyin sreg\") widely feature in Tibetan Buddhism and Bön and are linked to a variety of Mahayana Buddhas and tantric deities.\n\nHoma rituals are also found in Jainism. For example, the \"Ghantakarn\" ritual is a homa sacrifice, which has evolved over the centuries, and where ritual offerings are made into fire, with \"pancamrit\" (milk, curd, sugar, saffron and clarified butter) and other symbolic items such as coconut, incense, seeds and herbs. The mantra recited by Jains include those in Sanskrit, and the 16th-century Svetambara text \"Ghantakarna Mantra Stotra\" is a Sanskrit text which describes the homa ritual dedicated to Ghantakarna Mahavira in one of the Jaina sects.\n\nThe \"Adipurana\" of Jainism, in section 47.348, describes a Vedic fire ritual in the memory of Rishabha. Traditional Jaina wedding ceremonies, like among the Hindus, is a Vedic fire sacrifice ritual.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5001939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5001939", "title": "Meykhana", "text": "Meykhana\n\nMeykhana () is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject. Meykhana is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.\n\nMeykhana is often compared to hip hop music, also known as \"national rap\" among Azerbaijani residents, as it also includes performers that is spoken lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Performers also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Meykhana masters may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat.\n\nThe name of this genre comes from the traditional Persian \"meykhane\" (tavern, pub), which itself originated from the Persian word \"mey\" (wine) and \"khane\" (house). The professional performers of meykhana are known as the \"Söz Ustadı\" (Word Masters) in Azeri, also called as the meykhana masters.\n\nSince medieval times, meyhanes were places where poets would gather exchanging verses in an extemporaneous fashion, sometimes joking and disparaging one another. At the end of the contest, the audience determined which poet had improvised the most elegant and clever verses and declared him the winner. These contests may be compared with modern poetry improvisation contests or even with rap battles.\n\nMeykhana was performed among the youth of Baku settlements in the pre-Revolutionary time. Although during the Soviet period meykhana was banned, the poetry of Aliagha Vahid was often rhymed as a contemporary meykhana. This could be related to the meykhana's popularity among the residents of Baku and Absheron regions.\n\nAfter Soviet Union's downfall, meykhana found mainstream acceptance in Azerbaijan, though many fundamentalists still protested the genre, saying that it was still too liberal and in contrast to traditional national values. They claimed the musical genre still promoted sexuality, alcohol, drugs and Western consumer culture, but critics of the fundamentalist viewpoint stated that fundamentalists and meykhana musicians were ultimately seeking converts from the same population, the youth, who often had to choose where they belonged between the two cultures.\n\nNew performers emerged in this era with their distinctive takes on meykhana: Aghasalim Childagh, Kabir Azeri, Aghamirza Mammadov, Aghakarim Novruzov, Elchin Mashtagaly and Mashadibaba Aydamirov started the meykhana wave, combining Azerbaijani national music-influenced meykhana music with electronic music. Nizami Ramzi was first meykhana master to be ever performed in national television and in popular movies.\n\nAs the 90s progressed, meykhana's sound became more standardized as newer performers drew inspiration for the same collective set of influences that included Aydin Khirdalanli, Rashad Daghly, Elshan Khazar, Vahid Gadim, Mahir Ju'rat, Oktay, Vugar Mashtagaly and Namig Mana. Namig Garachukhurlu, in particular, with its romantic dissonance and duos with Azerbaijani pop singers like Aygun Kazimova, created the sonic template for a new movement, which became known as popular music-meykhana songs. However, this produced division among meykhana performers. The fundamentalist meykhana performers decided to keep the classical style which they have used through last decades, while the new wave of meykhana performers decided to combine meykhana with different musical genres.\n\nWith the increased popularity of meykhana in the 1990s and the 2000s, television channels started broadcasting and creating meykhana tournaments. The television programs such as \"De, Gəlsin!\" (Say, Come On!) in ANS TV led meykhana to popularize even more among local residents and demand for meykhana increased significantly in Azerbaijani weddings.\n\nThe most known type of meykhana is verbal exchange (\"deyişmə\"), where some phrase or sentence forms a rhyme with the following couplets.\n\nThroughout the course of meykhana music's development and commercialization in Azerbaijan, there have been many attempts to stifle the art form. From lyrical content to the album cover images, meykhana has been a controversial music. Religious identity and transnationalism function to define the complexities of Azerbaijani identity in world. This complex identity is expressed through meykhana and is often contested and censored in many cultural contexts.\n\nMeykhana started to circulate on a larger mainstream scale, via cassette tape sales, TV exposure, and radio play, adding to the national economy. However, as the music mainstreamed, its audio and visual content became more tamed by the government in hopes to reach a larger audience. In essence, the government attempted to \"clean up\" meykhana's content and image to adhere to the religious beliefs instilled in Azerbaijani culture.\n\nTo successfully deliver a meykhana, a meykhana master must also develop vocal presence, enunciation, and breath control. Vocal presence is the distinctiveness of a meykhana master's voice on record. Enunciation is essential to a flowing meykhana couplets; some meykhana masters choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one's delivery, is an important skill for a meykhana performer to master.\n\nMeykhana couplets are always delivered with melody. The ability to compose quickly, meaningful and clearly meykhana couplets is regarded as an important sign of skill.\n\nThe nationwide popularity of meykhana music meant that it became a major influence on culture, fashion and social attitudes. Different subgenres of meykhana were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of sub-cultures. These reforms also laid the foundation of the modern Azerbaijani hip hop, who adopted meykhana style, respectively in the 1990s. Since its early development meykhana has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most obviously in early meykhana music's rejection of a government dominated culture, the counter-culture's rejection of consumerism of all forms of social convention.\n\nOn 30 May 2012, an anti-Putin Twitter message started trending worldwide after opposition activists posted a hashtag \"Putin, who are you? Come on, get out of here\" (#путинтыктотакойдавайдосвидания), inspired by a meykhana in the Astara region of Azerbaijan (\"Ty kto takoy? Davay, do svidaniya!\"). It became an internet meme and made worldwide trends. In June 2012, Russian rapper Timati with other rappers made a diss track \"Davaydosvidaniya\" about Philipp Kirkorov after sampling from this song.\n\n\n\n"}

Although \"\"muk\"\" means \"jelly\", when used without qualifiers, it usually refers to \"dotorimuk\". The practice of making \"dotorimuk\" originated in mountainous areas of ancient Korea, when abundant oak trees produced enough acorns each autumn to become a viable source of food.\n\nDespite being a rich source of starch and proteins, acorns contain large amounts of tannins and other polyphenols, which prevent the human body from digesting them properly. Harvested acorns must be properly leached of the tannins prior to consumption.\n\nAcorns are either collected directly from the ground or knocked off the tree branches. The acorns are opened and their innards ground into a fine orange-brown paste. The paste is then stirred into vats of water and the acorns' fiber is separated from the starch through sieving and settling. The starch-water mixture is collected and allowed to sit so that the tannins in the starch diffuse into the water, which is changed several times. The overall soaking time depends on the amount of tannins in the paste.\n\nThe now-tannin-free starch-water suspension should have an off-white colour. This starch is allowed to completely settle at the bottom of the vat, the water drained away and the paste collected in trays to dry. The dried starch cake is then pulverized and packaged for sale. \"Dotorimuk\" is also commercially available in powdered form, which must be mixed with water, boiled until pudding-like in consistency, then set in a flat dish.\n\nLike other \"muk\", \"dotorimuk\" is most commonly eaten in the form of \"dotorimuk muchim\" (도토리묵무침), a side dish in which small chunks of \"dotorimuk\" are seasoned and mixed with other ingredients such as slivered carrots and scallions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, red chili pepper powder, and sesame seeds.\n\nMuk-mari (묵말이) is also famous.

It was bound with nine green lengths of ash bands or 'beams', preferably all from the same tree. At the appropriate moment during Christmas Eve, the faggot must be burnt in a hearth while people who are watching sing Dunster Carols.\n\nAsh was probably chosen for this ritual because the ash tree has a long pedigree of magical associations: perhaps the most important is the Yggdrasil of Norse mythology, also known as the World Ash Tree.\n\nThe “Christianized” version of the use of ash was when Mary used wood to light a fire in order to wash infant Jesus. In Romanian culture, it was thought that Jesus was born in a field and that he was kept warm by the head of an ash.\n\nThe wassail party passes around a bundle of ash sticks, twigs or branches—the remnant of the previous year's faggot—bound with green ash withies, which is then placed onto the fire. It is done traditionally by the oldest person in the room. The heat created is a comfort in midwinter nights.\n\nAs each binding bursts, the watchers toast it with a drink. Some traditions had the unmarried women each choosing a withy, and the first one whose tie snapped would be married the next year.\n\nWhen the bindings have all burst and the bundle has fallen loose, each person who plans to host the festivities next year takes one of the half-burned ash sticks and saves it until the following Christmas, when it will go in the centre of their own ashen faggot. This tradition symbolizes continuity of life and endures (or has been resurrected) in many places; the Winter 2005 issue of \"Devon Talk\" claims that the Harbour Inn in Axmouth annually builds an ashen faggot six feet high and three feet wide for their huge fireplace.\n\nThis tradition survives in pubs on the border between Devon and Somerset (The Squirrel Inn in Laymore being one of these) and is celebrated on the evening of the 6th of January each year (old Christmas Eve). Here the ritual centres on an ashen faggot around twelve feet in length bound by approximately a dozen withies. At the beginning of the evening, the butt of the faggot is placed against the rear of the fireplace, where a fire is already ablaze. Bets are then placed on the length of time (which is usually several hours) until the last binding bursts, with the closest estimate winning a prize and the proceeds going to charity.\n\nIt was believed that any household that did not burn the ashen faggot would face years of bad luck and misfortune. Some versions suggest that an ashen faggot kept in the house would keep away the Devil and evil spirits.\n\nShirley Collins's song the \"Ashen Faggot Wassail\", on her 1974 Topic album \"Adieu to Old England\", is a celebration of the tradition.\n\n\n"}

It has been described as the \"most well-known national dish of Israel\", and is a standard accompaniment to most Israeli meals. Salads following essentially the same recipe, with different names, are widespread and popular throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. It was adopted from local versions by Jewish immigrants to the Levant in the late 19th century.\n\nThe name \"Israeli Salad\" is used mainly outside of Israel. In Israel, it is commonly referred to as \"salat katzutz\" (, \"chopped salad\"), as well as \"salat aravi\" (, \"Arab salad\"), or \"salat yerakot\" (, \"vegetable salad\"). Palestinians may call their traditional dish \"salatat al-bandura\" or \"salatat banadura\" (\"tomato salad\"), or \"salata na'meh\".\n\nIsraeli salad is made of chopped raw tomato, onion and cucumber, and can also include pepper, carrot, scallion, leafy greens and parsley. The salad is dressed with either fresh lemon juice or olive oil, or both. Za'atar and yogurt are very common dressings at breakfast while sumac and tahini are common the rest of the day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The ability to chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into the \"finest, most perfect dice\" is considered a mark of status among many kibbutz cooks. Traditional recipes do not include lettuce.\n\nIn Israeli restaurants and cafes, Israeli salad is served as an independent side dish, as an accompaniment to main dishes, or stuffed in a pita with falafel or shawarma. It was part of the traditional Israeli breakfast at home before Western-style breakfast cereals became popular, and remains a standard feature at buffet breakfasts at Israeli hotels, as well as in many homes.\n\nAlthough cucumbers have an ancient history in the Middle East, tomatoes, native to South America, were not cultivated in the Syria region until possibly as late as the 19th century, during the Ottoman Empire. The origins of the Israeli salad are traced by Gil Hovav, Israeli food editor and chef, to a Palestinian Arab salad. He states that, \"this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it’s an Arab salad, Palestinian salad….” The idea that what is known in New York delis as \"Israeli salad\" stems from a Palestinian rural salad is also agreed on by Joseph Massad, a Palestinian professor of Arab Politics at Columbia University, as an example of the appropriation of Palestinian and pan-Syrian foods such as hummus, falafel, and tabbouleh by Israel as \"national dishes\". Food historian Gil Marks describes how Jewish immigrants in the late 19th century first encountered the cucumber and tomato salad in then-Ottoman Palestine, and traces its presence there back to the Turkish \"çoban salatası\" (shepherd's salad). Adopted and popularized in Israel by the kibbutzim, variations on the basic recipe have been made by the different Jewish communities that immigrated to the country. For example, Jews from India prepare it with the addition of finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.\n\nOther similar chopped salads found in the Middle East, include the Persian \"salad shirazi\" سالاد شيرازي (which includes mint, diced onions, and peeled cucumbers), and the Turkish \"çoban salatası\"; among others found throughout the eastern Mediterranean area in Turkey, Lebanon, and Egypt. The Indian subcontinent cuisine also includes a variant of this salad, called \"kachumber\".\n\n"}

A wall painting in the \"Goguryeo\" tombs complex (고구려 고분군; 高句麗 古墳群) in South Hwanghae Province, a UNESCO World Heritage site which dates from 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse (Ahn, 2000).\n\nApproximately in 1816, \"Jeong Hak Yu\" (정학유; 丁學遊), the second son of \"Jeong Yak-yong\" (정약용; 丁若鏞), a prominent politician and scholar of Choseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called \"Nongawollyeonga\" (농가월령가; 農家月令歌). This poem, an important source of Korean folk history, describes what ordinary Korean farmer families did in each month of a year. In the description of August, the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002).\n\nIn \"Dongguk Seshigi\" (동국세시기; 東國歲時記), a book written by a Korean scholar Hong Suk Mo (홍석모; 洪錫謨) in 1849, contains a recipe of Boshintang including a boiled dog and green onion.\n\nA common misconception is that Boshintang (and dog meat in general) is outright illegal in South Korea, this is not quite true. It is not classified as a livestock (under the Livestock Sanitation Management Act - livestock covered are cattle, horse, donkey, sheep, goat, pig, chicken, duck, geese, turkey, quail, pheasant, rabbit and deer), which some have taken to indicate its illegality, but it simply means it is unregulated except by the more general Food Sanitation Law. As such, restaurants serving Boshintang are subject to regular inspection by city food hygiene inspections (including testing of the dog meat for contaminants), as are all other restaurants. The conditions of the raising and of the slaughtering of the animals are not subject to inspection, unlike the above regulated livestock. Dog meat (of which Boshintang is one of the most commonly served dishes) is still regularly consumed and can be found easily at many restaurants across South Korea. In 2006 it was, in fact, the 4th most commonly consumed meat in South Korea, after beef, chicken and pork (an industry value of 1.4 trillion won).\n\nThere are many different names for this dish in the Korean language.\n\n\nNot to be confused with the homophone \"게장\" (\"gejang\"; marinated crabs) or \"육개장\" (\"Yukgaejang\"; beef soup).\n"}

It is used both in the Upanishads and the Mahāyāna sūtras.\n\nIn the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", \"ekayāna\" took on special significance as a metaphor for a spiritual journey. The phrase \"vedānāṃ vāk ekayānam\" translates approximately to \"the one destination of the Vedas is the spirit of the word\".\n\nEarly Buddhist texts such as the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta use the term 'ekāyano maggo' to refer to the Four Satipatthanas. While some have translated this as the \"one path\" (to nirvana), Bhikkhu Analayo argues that a better translation would be \"the direct path\".\n\nEkayāna sutras of primary influence are the \"Lotus Sutra\", the \"Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra\", the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" and the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras, which also include the \"Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra\", the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" and the \"Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra\". Sutras with similar teachings include the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" and the \"Avatamsaka Sutra\". The \"Lotus Sutra\" declares that \"the three vehicles of the Śrāvaka (disciple), Pratyekabuddha (Solitary Buddha), and Bodhisattva are actually just three expedient devices (upayacausalya) for attracting beings to the one buddha vehicle, via which they all become buddhas.\"\n\nWhile the \"One Vehicle\" Buddhism declined in India along with the rest of Buddhism, it became a key aspect of the Chinese acculturation and acceptance of Buddhism. The Chinese assimilation of Buddhism met in the vast diversity of Buddhist texts the problem of sorting through them for the core of Buddhist teaching. This problem was solved by the greatest Buddhist minds of China by taking up one or more of the Ekayana Sutras as central to the understanding of the diversity of Buddhism. The doctrines and practices of Tiantai (J. Tendai) and Huayen (J. Kegon) Buddhist sects were able to present a synthesis of the diversity of Buddhism that was understandable and palatable by the Chinese worldview.\n\nChan Buddhism affected this synthesis in a unique way by focusing on the practice of meditation as taught in the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" as the core method of personally realizing the Ekayana teachings while at the same time acknowledging the transcendental and devotional aspects represented by the \"Avataṃsaka\" and \"Lotus Sutra\"s, respectively. The Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma (c. 5th to 6th century), who is considered the founder of Chan Buddhism, was said to have brought the \"Ekayāna school of Southern India\" to China and passed it down along with the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" to his primary disciple, Dazu Huike (487-593), known as the Second Founding Ancestor of the Chan lineage.\n\nGuifeng Zongmi (780 - 841) was an accredited master of both the Chan and Huayan lineages. In his treatise, \"The Original Person Debate\" (), he explicitly identifies the Ekayāna teachings as the most profound type of spiritual realization and equates it with the direct realization of one's own nature:\nThus, according to Zongmi who was a lineage master of both Huayan and Chan, he clearly distinguished the Ekayana from the Mahayana, and the Mahayana teachings of Yogacara (his Mahayana class 3) and Madhyamaka (his Mahayana class 4) were eclipsed by the more profound Ekayana teaching of \"manifesting nature.\"\n\n\n"}

It is ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European \"*médʰu\", whence English \"mead\".\n\n\"Madhu\" has been used for millennia since the Rigveda (1700-1100 BCE) in a similar metaphorical sense as \"wine\" is in English, e.g. \"\"the wine of truth\", and employed in that manner in Hindu religious literature. For example, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, believed to have been composed in the first millennium BCE, contains a chapter called the \"Madhu Brahmana\" and \"the secret essence of the Vedas themselves, was called the madhu-vidya or honey doctrine\".\n\nThere are different opinions surrounding the word \"Madhu\". Some scholars opine metaphorical usage of \"madhu\" to a time very close to the initial composition of the Vedas. Soma, the shared sacred drink of the Indo-Iranians (known as \"Haoma\" in Avestan), is often metaphorically referred to as \"Madhu\" in the Vedas. However, \"the Avesta, which is quite close to the Veda with regard to the terminology of Soma, does not know the equation Soma = madhu.\"\n\nThe derivative form \"Madhur\" (मधुर, مدھُر) is used as a Hindu first-name for males and \"Madhu\" is a first-name common among males, although both names can occur for either gender. \"Madhuri\" is a common feminine variant of \"Madhur\". The word \"madhur\" is a combination of \"madhu\" (honey/sweet) and \"-r/-ra\" (like or similar). Several other names are based on the root \"madhu\", such as \"Madhukar\", \"Madhusudhan\", \"Madhulika\" and \"Madhubala\".\n\n"}

{"id": "5100543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5100543", "title": "Caramel color", "text": "Caramel color\n\nCaramel color or caramel coloring is a water-soluble food coloring. It is made by heat treatment of carbohydrates, in general in the presence of acids, alkalis, or salts, in a process called caramelization. It is more fully oxidized than caramel candy, and has an odor of burnt sugar and a somewhat bitter taste. Its color ranges from pale yellow to amber to dark brown.\n\nCaramel color is one of the oldest and most widely used food colorings for enhancing naturally occurring colors, correcting natural variations in color, and replacing color that is lost to light degradation during food processing and storage. The use of caramel color as a food additive in the brewing industry in the 19th century is the first recorded instance of it being manufactured and used on a wide scale. Today, caramel color is found in many commercially produced foods and beverages, including batters, beer, brown bread, buns, chocolate, cookies, cough drops, spirits and liquor such as brandy, rum, and whisky, chocolate-flavored confectionery and coatings, custards, decorations, fillings and toppings, potato chips, dessert mixes, doughnuts, fish and shellfish spreads, frozen desserts, fruit preserves, glucose tablets, gravy, ice cream, pickles, sauces and dressings, soft drinks (especially colas), sweets, vinegar, and more. Caramel color is widely approved for use in food globally but application and use level restrictions vary by country.\nCaramel color is manufactured by heating carbohydrates, either alone or in the presence of acids, alkalis, and/or salts. Caramel color is produced from commercially available nutritive sweeteners consisting of fructose, dextrose (glucose), invert sugar, sucrose, malt syrup, molasses, starch hydrolysates, and fractions thereof. The acids that may be used are sulfuric, sulfurous, phosphoric, acetic, and citric acids; the alkalis are ammonium, sodium, potassium, and calcium hydroxides; and the salts are ammonium, sodium, and potassium carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate (including mono- and dibasic), sulfate, and bisulfite. Antifoaming agents, such as polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, may be used as processing aids during manufacture. Its color ranges from pale-yellow to amber to dark-brown.\n\nCaramel color molecules carry either a positive or a negative charge depending upon the reactants used in their manufacture. Problems such as precipitation, flocculation, or migration can be eliminated with the use of a properly charged caramel color for the intended application.\n\nInternationally, the United Nations Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) recognizes four classes of caramel color, differing by the reactants used in their manufacture, each with its own INS and E number, listed in the table below. Each class consists of a variety of caramels with their own unique properties that make it suitable for use in specific foods and/or beverages.\n\nColor intensity (or, tinctorial power) is defined as the absorbance of a 1 mg/mL (0.1% weight/volume) solution in water, measured using a 1 cm light path at a wavelength of 610 nanometers (or 560 nm for tinctorial power). In this case, \"A\" stands for absorbance and \"TS\" stands for total solids.\n\nThe color tone of the caramel color is also important. This is defined by the Linner Hue Index, which is the measure of the color hue or red characteristics of the caramel color. It is a function of the absorbance of light of wavelengths 510 and 610 nm. In general, the higher the Tinctorial Power, K, the lower the Hue Index and the lower the red tones.\n\nVarious other indices are in use around the world and there are conversion factors between them.\n\nCaramel color is a colloid. Though the primary function of caramel color is for coloration, it also serves additional functions. In soft drinks, it can function as an emulsifier to help inhibit the formation of certain types of \"floc\" and its light protective quality can aid in preventing oxidation of the flavoring components in bottled beverages.\n\nInternationally, JECFA has set the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of Class I caramel color as \"not specified\"; that of Class II as 0–160 mg/kg body weight; and that of Class III & IV as 0–200 mg/kg body weight.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies and regulates caramel color in Title 21 CFR § 73.85 as an approved color additive exempt from certification. Unless a food has a standard of identity, caramel color may be safely used in foods generally at levels consistent with \"good manufacturing practice\" (GMP).\n\nCaramel color has excellent microbiological stability. Since it is manufactured under very high temperature, high acidity, high pressure, and high specific gravity, it is essentially sterile, as it will not support microbial growth unless in a dilute solution.\n\nWhen reacted with sulfites, caramel color may retain traces of sulfite after processing. However, in finished food products, labeling is usually required only for sulfite levels above 10 ppm.\n\nIn 2010, the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) concluded that commercially produced caramel color has the same toxicological properties as caramel produced by cooking or heating sucrose, except for those prepared using ammonium (Class III and IV). The IPCS has concluded that caramel color does not exhibit carcinogenicity or mutagenicity, based on its studies. Additional long-term studies support a conclusion that caramel colors are not carcinogenic. While the US FDA, Canadian Health Products and Food Branch and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have found caramel color safe for use in food and beverages, California has listed 4-Methylimidazole (4-MeI), a compound formed in the manufacture of Class III and IV caramel colors, in the state’s Proposition 65, thus legally including it in the category of chemicals “known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity”. According to the Food Chemicals Codex, 4-MeI in caramel color is allowed up to 250 ppm on a color-adjusted basis, which means 250 ppm maximum for every 0.100 color absorbance of a 0.10% solution at 610 nm. The exposure to 4-MeI at levels present in Class III and IV caramel colors are not expected to be of concern for two reasons. Firstly, 4-MeI does not appear to be genotoxic or metabolized to a reactive metabolite. Secondly, carcinogenic doses of 4-MeI exceed estimates of exposure from the consumption of caramel coloring by several thousand-fold.\n\nCaramel coloring may be derived from a variety of source products that are themselves common allergens, namely starch hydrolysates (from wheat), malt syrup (in general derived from barley), or lactose (from milk). As such, persons with known sensitivities or allergies to food products are advised to avoid foods including generic caramel coloring or first determine the source for the caramel coloring before consuming the food. Caramel color produced from corn or cane-based materials would be unlikely to contain gluten due to the lack of gliadin in the carbohydrates. North American and European manufacturers mostly use glucose derived from corn or wheat to produce caramel color, which is highly processed and is generally considered gluten-free.\n\n"}

The first Western mention of \"sherbet\" is an Italian reference to something that Turks drink. In the 17th-century, England began importing \"sherbet powders\" from Ottoman Empire made from dried fruit and flowers mixed with sugar. By 1662, a coffeehouse in London advertised the availability of \"sherbets made in Turkie of Lemons, Roses and Violets perfumed\". In 1670, Café Procope opened in Paris and began selling sorbet. (In the modern era sherbet powder is still popular in the UK.) When Europeans figured out how to freeze sherbet they began making \"sorbetto\" by adding fruit juices and flavorings to a frozen simple syrup base. In the US sherbet generally meant an ice milk, but recipes from early soda fountain manuals include ingredients like gelatin, beaten egg whites, cream, or milk.\n\nAgraz is a type of sorbet that is usually associated with the Maghreb and north Africa. It is made from almonds, verjuice, and sugar. It has a strongly acidic flavour, because of the verjuice. (\"Larousse Gastronomique\")\n\nGivré (French for \"frosted\") is the term for a sorbet served in a frozen coconut shell or fruit peel, such as a lemon peel.\n\nLike granitas and other ices, sorbet can be made without an ice cream maker. Alcohol, honey or corn syrup can be added to lower the freezing point and make softer sorbets.\n\nMulled wine sorbet can be made with red wine, orange, lemons, mulling spices, ruby port, and egg whites. Muscat sorbet is made with dessert wine, lemon juice, and egg whites.\n\nIn English Canada, sorbet, which is known as \"sherbet\", is defined as a frozen food rather than as ice cream or ice milk, which are made from milk/dairy products. A typical Canadian sherbet may contain water, a sweetening agent, fruit or fruit juice, citric or tartaric acids, flavouring preparation, food coloring, sequestering agent(s), and lactose. Additional stipulations for sherbet include requirements that it contain no more than 5% milk solids (i.e. milk fat) and no less than 0.35% acids. Acidity levels are determined via the process of chemical titration, and the acidity in sherbet is usually expressed as lactic acid content. Such criteria, plus any others needed for the product to be packaged and sold as \"sherbet\" in Canada, are among the food and drug regulations outlined in the Canadian Food and Drugs Act under the authority of the government of Canada.\n\nCommercially produced sherbet in the United States is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as a frozen product containing one or more optional dairy products. Sorbet, on the other hand, is made with sweetened ice and no dairy; it is similar to Italian ice, but made with real fruit instead of imitation flavoring.\n\nHomemade sherbets do not always contain dairy. Early 20th-century American recipes for sherbet include some versions made with water. \"The American Kitchen Magazine\" from 1902 distinguishes \"water ices\" from sherbets, explaining that \"sherbets are water ices frozen more rapidly, and egg white or gelatin is often added to give a creamy consistency\". In one recipe for pineapple sherbet, water may be used in place of milk. It also separately discusses \"milk sherbets\". \n\nAccording to \"The American Produce Review\" (1913) \"Sherbet is a frozen product made from water or milk, egg whites, sugar, lemon juice and flavoring material\". Sherbets are made from a base of \"plain ice\" which is water, sugar, egg whites, and lemon juice.\n"}

Terms of endearment are used for a variety of reasons, such as parents addressing their children and lovers addressing each other.\n\nSuch words may not in their original use, bear any resemblance in meaning to the meaning attached when used as a term of endearment, for example calling a significant other \"pumpkin\". Some words are clearly derived from each other, such as \"sweetheart\" and \"sweetie\", while others bear no etymological resemblance, such as \"baby\", \"babe\", and \"cutie\". \"Honey\" has been documented as a term of endearment from at least the 14th century. \"Baby\" is first used in 1839 and \"sugar\" only appears as recently as 1930.\n\nEach term of endearment has its own connotations, which are highly dependent on the situation they are used in, such as tone of voice, body language, and social context. Saying \"Hey baby, you're looking good\" varies greatly from the use \"Baby, don't swim at the deep end of the pool!\" Certain terms can be perceived as offensive or patronizing, depending on the context and speaker.\n\nFeminists have complained that while 'terms of endearment are words used by close friends, families, and lovers...they are also used on women by perfect strangers...double standard' – because 'between strangers terms of endearment imply a judgment of incompetence on the part of the target'. Others have pointed out however that, in an informal setting like a pub, 'the use of terms of endearment here was a positive politeness strategy. A term like \"mate\", or \"sweetie\", shifts the focus of the request away from its imposition...toward the camaraderie existing between interlocutors'.\n\nTerms of endearment often 'make use of internal rhyme...[with] still current forms such as lovey-dovey, which appeared in 1819, and honey bunny', or of other duplications. Some such combinations seem nonsensical, odd, or too long, however, such as \"baby pie\" or \"love dear\", and are seldom used.\n\nTerms of endearment can lose their original meaning over the course of time: thus for example 'in the early twentieth century the word \"crumpet\" was used as a term of endearment by both sexes', before diminishing later into a 'term of objectification' for women.\n\nTerms of endearment are also used as a sort of \"significant other identity\".\n\n'French has all kinds of interesting terms of endearment, including a rather odd assortment of barnyard animals...[like] mon canard (my duck)' – something which may be compared to the British 'baby talk...duckie'.\n\nWhen proper names escape one, terms of endearment can always substitute, producing (as Lacan put it) the 'opacity of the ejaculations of love, when, lacking a signifier to name the object of its epithalamium, it employs the crudest trickery of the imaginary. \"I'll eat you up...Sweetie!\" \"You'll love it...Rat!\"'.\n\nEric Berne identified the marital game of \"Sweetheart\", where 'White makes a subtly derogatory remark about Mrs White, disguised as anecdote, and ends: \"Isn't that right, sweetheart?\" Mrs. White tends to agree...because it would seem surly to disagree with a man who calls one \"sweetheart\" in public'.\n\nBerne points out that 'the more tense the situation, and the closer the game is to exposure, the more bitterly is the word \"sweetheart\" enunciated'; while the wife's antithesis is either 'to reply: \"Yes, \"honey\"!\"' or to 'respond with a similar \"Sweetheart\" type anecdote about the husband, saying in effect, \"You have a dirty face too, dear\"'.\n\n\n\n"}

An early American staple food, it is prepared on the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to Jamaica. The food originates from the native inhabitants of North America. It is still eaten in the West Indies, Dominican Republic, Saint Croix, The Bahamas, Colombia, and Bermuda as well as in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe modern johnnycake is found in the cuisine of New England, and often claimed as originating in Rhode Island. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and sometimes sweetened. In the Southern United States, the term used is \"hoecake\", although this can also refer to cornbread fried in a pan.\n\nThe earliest attestation of the term \"johnny cake\" is from 1739 (in South Carolina); the spelling \"journey cake\" is only attested from 1775 on the Gulf Coast, but may be the earlier form.\n\nThe word is likely based on the word \"Jonakin\", recorded in New England in 1765, itself derived from the word \"jannock\", recorded in Northern England in the sixteenth century. According to Edward Ellis Morris, the term was the name given \"... by the [American] negroes to a cake made of Indian corn (maize).\"\n\nAnother suggested derivation is that it comes from \"Shawnee cake\", although some writers disagree.\n\nThe term \"hoecake\" is first attested in 1745, and the term is used by American writers such as Joel Barlow and Washington Irving. The origin of the name is the method of preparation: they were cooked on a type of iron pan called a hoe. There is conflicting evidence regarding the common belief that they were cooked on the blades of gardening hoes.\n\nA hoecake can be made either out of cornbread batter or leftover biscuit dough. A cornbread hoecake is thicker than a cornbread pancake.\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas were using ground corn for cooking long before European explorers arrived in the New World. The johnnycake originates with the native inhabitants of Northern America; the Algonquians of the Atlantic seaboard are credited with teaching Europeans how to make the food. It is also claimed that johnnycakes were made by the Narragansett People as far back as the 1600s.\n\nSouthern Native American culture (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek) is the cornerstone of Southern cuisine. From this culture came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize). Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes from the familiar cornbread and grits to liquors such as whiskey and moonshine, which were important trade items. Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different sizes and forms. It could be fashioned into high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried for a fast meal.\n\nTo a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Southeastern Indians live on today is the \"soul food\" eaten by both black and white Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten ... Sofkee live on as grits ... cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks ... Indian fritters ... variously known as \"hoe cake\", ... or \"Johnny cake.\"... Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as \"corn meal dumplings\", ... and as \"hush puppies\", ... Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Indians ... like the Indians they cure their meat and smoke it over hickory coals.\n\nJohnnycakes are an unleavened cornbread made of cornmeal (but see the Australian version below), salt, and water. Early cooks set thick corn dough on a wooden board or barrel stave, which they leaned on a piece of wood or a rock in front of an open fire to bake.\n\nIn the American south during the 18th century versions were made with rice or hominy flour and perhaps cassava. A 1905 cookbook includes a recipe for \"Alabama Johnny Cake\" made with rice and 'meal'.\n\nThe difference between johnnycake and hoecake originally lay in the method of preparation, though today both are often cooked on a griddle or in a skillet. Some recipes call for baking johnnycakes in an oven, similar to corn pones, which are still baked in the oven as they were traditionally.\n\nJohnnycakes may also be made using leavening, with or without other ingredients more commonly associated with American pancakes, such as eggs or solid fats like butter. Like pancakes, they are often served with maple syrup, honey, or other sweet toppings.\n\nAccording to the manuscript of \"America Eats\", a WPA guide to American food culture in the beginning decades of the twentieth century, Rhode Island \"jonny cakes\" were made in the 1930s as follows:\n\nIn preparation, [white corn] meal may or may not be scalded with hot water or hot milk in accordance to preference. After mixing meal with water or milk it is dropped on a smoking hot spider [pan] set atop a stove into cakes about 3\"x3\"x1/2\" in size. The secret of cooking jonny cakes is to watch them closely and keep them supplied with enough sausage or bacon fat so they will become crisp, and not burn. Cook slowly for half an hour, turn occasionally, and when done serve with plenty of butter.\n\nIn Australia, \"Johnnycake\" refers to a quick bread made with flour rather than cornmeal; the cakes are baked in the hot ashes of a fire or fried in fat on a skillet.\n\nYaniqueques or yanikeke are a Dominican Republic version of the jonnycake, supposedly brought over in the nineteenth century by the Cocolos, or English-speaking migrants (possibly of Afro-Caribbean descent). These cakes are made with flour, baking powder, butter and water; however, they are typically deep-fried. They are a popular beach snack, especially in Boca Chica.\n\nBoth flour and cornmeal johnnycakes are popular beach food in Puerto Rico. They came to Puerto Rico from different parts of the Caribbean, notably of Dominican and Jamaican descent. They are deep-fried as most johnnycakes are and stuffed with seafood or as a sweet snack similar to funnel cake sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. The recipe is similar to that found in other regions; flour or cornmeal with butter and baking soda are standard, but sometimes coconut milk is used instead of water.\n\nJohnnycake is a traditional staple across the island. Some people call these fried dumplings whilst others say fried johnnycakes. Recipe incorporates flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, margarine or butter and water or milk. Once kneaded, the dough is fried in cooking oil.\n\nThe modern jonnycake is a staple in the cuisine of New England, and New Englanders claim it originated in Rhode Island. A modern jonnycake is fried gruel made from yellow or white cornmeal that is mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and sometimes sweetened. In the Southern United States, the same food is referred to as a hoecake.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5140025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5140025", "title": "Louis XIII (cognac)", "text": "Louis XIII (cognac)\n\nLouis XIII () is a cognac produced by Rémy Martin, a company headquartered in Cognac, France, and owned by the Rémy Cointreau Group. The name was chosen as a tribute to King Louis XIII of France, the reigning monarch when the Rémy Martin family settled in the Cognac region. He was the first monarch to recognize cognac as a category in its own right in the world of eaux-de-vie.\n\nLouis XIII cognac is produced in the Grande Champagne region of Cognac, from the growing of the grapes to the distillation and aging of the eaux-de-vie. The final blend is composed of up to 1,200 individual eaux-de-vie from Grande Champagne vineyards, ranging from at least 40 years to 100 years in age.\n\nThe origins of Louis XIII cognac begin with the founding of the House in the Cognac region in the early 1700s. In 1841, after more than a century of producing cognac, Paul-Emile Rémy Martin assumed control of the business and began selling the House’s cognacs under the family name.\n\nPaul-Emile broke from tradition and began bottling his cognacs rather than continuing to sell them by the barrel. In 1874, he began selling a blend of his best 100% Grande Champagne cognacs in an ornate decanter. While originally designated \"Grande Champagne Very Old – Age Unknown,\" this particular blend and its decanter later became known as Louis XIII.\n\nThe eaux-de-vie for Louis XIII are still exclusively sourced from the Grande Champagne \"cru\" of Cognac. This region in Cognac is distinguished for its limestone composition that is considered ideal for the grapes employed in the production of cognac. The ageing process takes place exclusively inside 100-150 year-old \"tierçons,\" thin-walled French oak casks originally designed for maritime transport that are no longer being produced.\n\nSince 1874, each generation of cellar master has selected the oldest and best eaux-de-vie for Louis XIII from the House’s cellars. As the cellar master may never taste the final blend for which some of these eaux-de-vie are intended, each cellar master must also carefully train a successor. The House’s current cellar master, Baptiste Loiseau, joined as an apprentice to the previous cellar master, and then assumed the position of cellar master in 2014 at the age of 34.\n\nThe concept for the decanter of Louis XIII originated in 1850, when Paul-Emile Rémy Martin came across a metal flask originally recovered from the site of the Battle of Jarnac (1569). He purchased the metal flask and registered the rights for its reproduction. In 1874, in honour of the House’s 150th anniversary, he designed a glass replica of the flask to use as the vessel for his best cognac. Today, each crystal decanter is handmade by French crystal manufacturers: Baccarat, Saint-Louis, and Cristallerie de Sèvres.\n\nLouis XIII is bottled in several sizes: Classic (700 ml or 750ml [USA]), Magnum (1.5L or 1.75L [USA]), Miniature (50ml), Jeroboam (3L), and Mathusalem (6L) formats.\n\nRare Cask 42.6 is distinguished by its alcohol content at 42.6% ABV rather than the expected 40%.\n\nRare Cask 43.8 was produced from a single cask with a higher alcohol content (43.8% ABV) than the other Louis XIII tierçons.\n\nBlack Pearl was created as an homage to the origins of Louis XIII. The colour of the crystal was inspired by the original metal flask found at the site of the battle of Jarnac.\n\nBlack Pearl Anniversary Edition was created to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the brand.\n\nL’Odyssée d’un Roi was released as a collaboration with three French luxury houses, Hermès, Puiforcat, and Saint-Louis. Hermès created a bespoke leather trunk, Puiforcat forged a white gold serving pipette, and Saint-Louis hand-blew and engraved a unique version of the decanter with a map of Louis XIII’s journey around the world. Only three were made, and were auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York, Hong Kong, and London, with the proceeds benefitting The Film Foundation’s preservation efforts.\n\nThe Origin is named in tribute to the original decanter created in 1874.\n\nThe Legacy is a direct collaboration between four generations of cellar masters. Offered in Magnum format, each is individually signed by the four cellar masters.\n\nIn November 2015, Louis XIII partnered with actor John Malkovich and director Robert Rodriguez to create a film entitled \"100 Years – The Movie You Will Never See,\" which will not be released until the year 2115, mirroring the 100 years it takes to create the final blend of Louis XIII cognac. The film highlights the uncertainty of the future and the variables that contribute to a single decanter of Louis XIII. The film is housed in a safe designed by Fichet-Bauche, kept at the Cellars of Louis XIII in Cognac, France, set to automatically open on November 18, 2115.\n\nIn November 2017, Louis XIII partnered with Pharrell Williams to create \"100 Years – The Song We’ll Only Hear If We Care\" to be released in 2117. The song is a collaborative effort intended to draw attention to environmental issues and the unpredictability of the future. Pharrell’s track was recorded on a disc made out of clay from the chalky soil of Cognac, France, and played once for an audience of 100 in Shanghai, China. The disc was then locked in a specially designed Fichet-Bauche safe that protects it against everything except water from potential rising tides, which would dissolve the clay disc.\n"}

{"id": "5154273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5154273", "title": "Positivism dispute", "text": "Positivism dispute\n\nThe positivism dispute (German: \"Positivismusstreit\") was a political-philosophical dispute between the critical rationalists (Karl Popper, Hans Albert) and the Frankfurt School (Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas) in 1961, about the methodology of the social sciences. It grew into a broad discussion within German sociology from 1961 to 1969. The naming itself is controversial, since it was the Frankfurt School proponents who accused the critical rationalists of being positivists—while the latter considered themselves as opponents of positivism. On the political level, it was a dispute between the leftist Frankfurt School proponents supporting revolution, and the allegedly bourgeois critical rationalists supporting reform as the method to be preferred to change society.\n\nThe debate began in 1961 in Tübingen, West Germany at the Conference of the German Society of Sociology. The speakers at the conference were invited to discuss the differences between social and natural sciences and the status of values in the social sciences.\n\nIn 1963, the debate was heated by Jürgen Habermas in the \"Festschrift für Adorno\" (writings in honour of Adorno). The debate became more intensely critical at the Sociology Day in Heidelberg when Herbert Marcuse joined the discussion. A spirited literary debate between Habermas and Hans Albert sprung up and positivism became the centre of the debate.\n\nThe participants also discussed the question of whether Popper's and Albert's critical rationalism had exacerbated ethical problems. The Frankfurt School believed this should be impossible, because as a theory of science critical rationalism is seen to be restricted to the field of knowledge.\n\nThe famous dispute inspired a collection of essays which were published in 1969. This book was translated into several languages, including English in 1976 (see below). This collection revived the debate and introduced these ideas to a broader audience.\n\nThe dispute has its foundation in the value judgment dispute (\"Werturteilsstreit\") in German sociology and economics around the question of whether or not the social sciences is a normative obligatory statement in politics and its measures applied in political actions, and whether or not their measures can be justified scientifically. Consequently, the positivism dispute is also called the Second \"Werturteilsstreit\".\n\nThe precursor of the debate about positivism can be traced back to Max Horkheimer's essay \"\"Der neueste Angriff auf die Metaphysik\"\" (\"The Latest Attack on Metaphysics\") published in 1937 that criticizes the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. The prolonged criticism of positivism led to the formation of two camps: on one side we find \"critical rationalism\" advanced by Karl Popper and on the other side there is the \"critical theory\" advanced in the Frankfurt School. This view was strengthened by the fact that Popper's main work, \"Logic of Scientific Discovery\", was published in the main book series of the Vienna Circle. Popper, however, considered himself an opponent of positivism, and his main work was a sharp attack on it.\n\nBoth camps accept that sociology cannot avoid a value judgement that inevitably influences subsequent conclusions. In critical rationalism the scientific approach should be maintained in sociology and wherever the use of an induction method is not possible it should be avoided. This leads to a sociology having a firm ground in observations and assured deductions that cannot be ignored in politics.\n\nFor critical rationalism, sociology is best conceived as a set of empirical questions subject to scientific investigation. Frankfurt School \"critical theory,\" by contrast, denies that sociology can be severed from its \"metaphysical\" heritage; empirical questions are necessarily rooted in substantive philosophical issues. Drawing on concepts from Hegelian and Marxian traditions, critical theory conceives of society as a concrete totality, a social environment in which various \"psycho-social agencies\" (family, authorities, peers, mass media) shape individual consciousness.\n\nAccording to the Frankfurt school, it is important to discover the society's fabrics to allow for individuals to overcome being cornered. Critical rationalism considers this goal to be impossible and any attempts (changing society out of possibly non-scientific deductions) to be dangerous. The Frankfurt school counters critical rationalism as being itself cornered, disallowing itself from asking scientific questions when just some methods are not available. Looking back in history \"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but their social existence that determines their consciousness\" (Karl Marx). The social existence determines the mindset of scientists as well. All the hypotheses generated by scientists (which would need to be falsified) are limited to this society's thinkable. While critical rationalism provides methods that are supposed to have an influence on society it is this totality that makes the reforms advocated by Popper ineffective for noticeable changes.\n\nPopper, in contrast, held that the Frankfurt school view was historicist ideology failing to see that any attempt to cause a total change of society (i.e., revolution) leads to violence, and that society should better be changed step by step (by reforms) to solve specific problems and abolish specific evils. According to Popper, individuals, including scientists, are free to decide, and are perhaps restricted by their social existence, but not totally determined by it. Changes may then look ineffective and very slow, but will accumulate over time. Popper thinks it is the lesser evil compared to violent revolutions, since such reforms can be undone if they turn out to only make things worse, while revolutions usually lead to lengthy periods of tyranny. Thus, for Popper, the method of reforms should be preferred.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5155338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5155338", "title": "Discourse marker", "text": "Discourse marker\n\nA discourse marker is a word or a phrase that plays a role in managing the flow and structure of discourse. Since their main function is at the level of discourse (sequences of utterances) rather than at the level of utterances or sentences, discourse markers are relatively syntax-independent and usually do not change the truth conditional meaning of the sentence. Examples of discourse markers include the particles \"oh\", \"well\", \"now\", \"then\", \"you know\", and \"I mean\", and the discourse connectives \"so\", \"because\", \"and\", \"but\", and \"or\". The term \"discourse marker\" was coined by Deborah Schiffrin in her 1988 book Discourse Markers.\n\nIn \"Practical English Usage\", Michael Swan defines a \"discourse marker\" as \"a word or expression which shows the connection between what is being said and the wider context\". For him, a discourse marker is something that either connects a sentence to what comes before or after, or indicates a speaker's attitude to what he is saying. He gives three examples: \"on the other hand\"; \"frankly\"; \"as a matter of fact\". Ian McCormick's \"The Art of Connection\" outlines nine classes of connectives based on their purpose:\n\n\nMcCormick points out that \"FANBOYS\" is mnemonic to recall co-ordinating conjunctions: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so.\n\nCommon discourse markers used in the English language include \"you know\", \"actually\", \"basically\", \"like\", \"I mean\", \"okay\" and \"so\". Data shows that discourse markers often come from different word classes, such as adverbs (\"well\") or prepositional phrases (\"in fact\"). The process that leads from a free construction to a discourse marker can be traced back through grammaticalisation studies and resources.\n\nTraditionally, some of the words or phrases that were considered discourse markers were treated as \"fillers\" or \"expletives\": words or phrases that had no function at all. Now they are assigned functions in different levels of analysis: topic changes, reformulations, discourse planning, stressing, hedging, or backchanneling. \n\nYael Maschler divided discourse markers into four broad categories: interpersonal, referential, structural, and cognitive.\n\n\nAnother example of an interpersonal discourse marker is the Yiddish marker \"nu\", also used in Modern Hebrew and other languages, often to convey impatience or to urge the listener to act (cf. German cognate \"nun\", meaning \"now\" in the sense of \"at the moment being discussed,\" but contrast Latin etymological cognate \"nunc\", meaning \"now\" in the sense of \"at the moment in which discussion is occurring\"; Latin used \"iam\" for \"at the moment being discussed,\" and German uses \"jetzt\" for \"at the moment in which discussion is occurring\").\n\n"}
{"id": "5156542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5156542", "title": "Progressive dispensationalism", "text": "Progressive dispensationalism\n\nIn Evangelical Christian theology, progressive dispensationalism is a variation of traditional dispensationalism. All dispensationalists view the dispensations as chronologically successive. Progressive dispensationalists, in addition to viewing the dispensations as chronologically successive, also view the dispensations as progressive stages in salvation history. The term \"progressive\" comes from the concept of an interrelationship or progression between the dispensations. Progressive dispensationalism is not related to any social or political use of the term progressive, such as progressive Christianity.\n\nWhile elements of progressive dispensational views were present in earlier dispensational writers, including Scofield and Eric Sauer, the view itself coalesced around specific issues and questions raised in the 1980s. Numerous dispensational scholars came to a rough consensus and in the early 1990s produced three main books articulating progressive dispensationalist views. Consequently, the editors and authors of the books - Craig A. Blaising, Darrell L. Bock, and Robert L. Saucy— are considered the primary spokespersons for progressive dispensationalism.\n\nProgressive and traditional dispensationalists hold to many common beliefs, including views that are uniquely dispensational. The vast majority of adherents in both schools hold to a distinction between Israel and the Church, a future pre-tribulation rapture, a seven-year tribulation, and a Millennial Kingdom in which the rule of Jesus Christ will be centered in Jerusalem (there are some variations within progressive dispensationalism where the rapture question is concerned).\n\nThe major difference between traditional and progressive dispensationalism is in how each views the relationship of the present dispensation to the past and future dispensations. Traditional dispensationalists perceive the present age of grace to be a \"parenthesis\" or \"intercalation\" in God's plans. In general, the concept means God's revealed plans concerning Israel from the previous dispensation has been \"put on hold\" until it resumes again after the rapture. Therefore, for traditional dispensationalists, the only relationship between the dispensations is chronologically successive. Instead of viewing the present dispensation as a parenthesis, progressives perceive the present age of grace as a vital link in God's plan of redemption.\n\nProgressive dispensationalists perceive a closer relationship between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant than do most traditional dispensationalists. One of the covenants which highlight the differences between the two views is the New Covenant. In the past, dispensationalists have had a variety of views with regard to the new covenant. Some dispensationalists, including Charles Ryrie and John F. Walvoord in the 1950s, argued for two new covenants: one new covenant for the Church and another new covenant for Israel. Other dispensationalists, including John Nelson Darby and John Master, argued for one new covenant applied only to Israel. And still other dispensationalists, including Cyrus I. Scofield and John McGahey in the 1950s, have argued for one new covenant for a believing Israel today and an ongoing partial fulfillment, and another new covenant for a future believing Israel when Jesus returns for a complete fulfillment.\n\nProgressive dispensationalists, like Blaising and Bock, argue for one new covenant with an ongoing partial fulfillment and a future complete fulfillment for Israel. Progressives hold that the new covenant was inaugurated by Christ at the Last Supper. Progressives hold that while there are aspects of the new covenant currently being fulfilled, there is yet to be a final and complete fulfillment of the new covenant in the future. This concept is sometimes referred to as an \"already-but-not-yet\" fulfillment.\n\nBoth traditional and progressive dispensationalists share the same historical-grammatical method. As with all dispensationalists, progressive revelation is emphasized so that the dispensationalist interprets the Old Testament in such a way as to retain the original meaning and audience. Thus progressives and traditionalists alike place great emphasis on the original meaning and audience of the text. The primary differences in hermeneutics between traditionalists and progressives are that progressives are more apt to see partial or ongoing fulfillment, and progressives are more apt to utilize complementary hermeneutics.\n\nThese differences between traditionalists and progressives show up in how one views the Old Testament texts and promises in the New Testament and how they are handled by the New Testament writers. For traditionalists, who perceive the present dispensation as a parenthesis, the standard approach has been to view Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as applications rather than fulfillment. If an Old Testament quotation is said to have a fulfillment role in the New Testament (outside of the gospels), then that may imply that the present dispensation is no longer a parenthesis, but has a relationship or connection with the prior dispensation. In contrast, progressives, instead of approaching all Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as application, attempt to take into account the context and grammatical-historical features of both Old Testament and New Testament texts. An Old Testament quote in the New Testament might turn out to be an application, but it also might be a partial fulfillment or a complete fulfillment or even something else.\n\nAs a framework for biblical interpretation, covenant theology stands in contrast to dispensationalism in regard to the relationship between the Old Covenant with national Israel and the New Covenant in Christ's blood.\n\nComplementary hermeneutics means that previous revelation (such as the Old Testament) has an added or expanded meaning alongside the original meaning. For example, in Jeremiah 31:31–34, the original recipients of the new covenant were Jews—i.e., \"the house of Israel and the house of Judah.\" Progressives hold that in Acts 2, believing Jews first participated in the new covenant based on Jer 31:31–34. Gentiles were not named as original participants. However, additional revelation came in Acts 9–10 concerning believing Gentiles where God (through Peter and Cornelius) formally accepted believing Gentiles as co-heirs with the Jews. In other words, God used additional New Testament revelation to further expand the participants of the new covenant to include believing Gentiles. God did not replace the original recipients or change the original meaning of the new covenant, He simply expanded it. This expansion of meaning while keeping the original intact is what is called complementary hermeneutics.\n\nCharles Ryrie had also laid less stress on the parenthetical nature of the age of the Church. The restatement of the \"parenthesis\" comes from the nature of the Church as the mystery, previously not known and now revealed, that Jews and Gentiles are united in one body (Eph. 3:1-7). Although Ryrie opposed some of the tenets of progressive dispensationalism, he also advanced in the late 1970s, many years prior to the progressive movement, something very similar to complementary hermeneutics, particularly in his interpretation of the new covenant which he held was one new covenant that had successive (complementary?) applications to different groups of believers. In other parts of the world, outside of the United States, dispensationalists had also laid a strong emphasis on the present aspect of the Kingdom of God (cp. Other revisionist, like Emilio Antonio Núñez, in Guatemala, who was also a theological heir of Ryrie).\n\n\n"}

The word \"notum\" is always applied to dorsal structures; in other words structures that are part of the back of an animal, as opposed to being part of the animal's ventral surface, or underside.\n\nThis word is used in entomology, the study of insects, and in malacology, the study of mollusks. In malacology the word is used to describe the back of the body of the taxonomic group of marine, shell-less gastropods that are known as nudibranchs.\n\nIn entomology, the notum is the dorsal portion of an insect's thoracic segment. The pterothoracic nota (comprising the meso- and metathoracic segments) have two main divisions - the anterior wing-bearing alinotum and the posterior phragma-bearing postnotom. The phragma, or endotergite, is a transverse infolding of the intersegmental sclerite, and its main function is to provide a reinforcing basis of attachment for the dorsal longitudinal muscles. Accordingly, phragmata tend to be best developed in actively flying insect species.\n\nIn most winged insects, the structure of each successive notum is quite variable; in the Neoptera, the main flight muscles insert on the notum, so the segment that bears the main pair of wings is typically the one with the most highly developed notum. For example, in Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera, the mesonotum is the most hypertrophied sclerite, and is commonly called the scutum. However, there are other groups of insects in which, for reasons other than flight, the pronotum is hypertrophied, such as in all beetles (Coleoptera), and most treehoppers (family Membracidae, order Hemiptera).\n\nThe notum on the first thoracic segment is called the pronotum, that on the second the mesonotum, and the third metanotum.\n\nNudibranchs are a large group of sea slugs, shell-less marine gastropod mollusks in the clade Nudibranchia.

{"id": "5178037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5178037", "title": "Mixed nuts", "text": "Mixed nuts\n\nMixed nuts are a snack food consisting of any mixture of mechanically or manually combined nuts. Peanuts (actually a legume), almonds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts (filberts), and pecans are common constituents of mixed nuts. Mixed nuts may be salted, roasted, cooked, or blanched.\n\nIn addition to being eaten directly, mixed nuts can be used in cooking, such as for Tunisian farka, tarts, and toffee. Trail mix consists of nuts mixed with raisins and other dry ingredients.\n\nIn Japan, mixed nuts are the second most popular table nuts, behind sweet chestnuts; in the United States, they are second only to peanuts. Mixed nuts have also gained in popularity in the Argentinian market, which imported some $1.9 million in 1997, nearly half from the U.S. During the year 2002, U.S. companies sold $783 million of mixed nuts incorporating four or more varieties, mostly in canned form, representing hundreds of millions of pounds.\n\nThe individual nuts that make up mixed nuts are harvested from all over the world. As a Dallas Fed publication supporting free trade puts it,\nThis reality provides an incentive for nut salters to favor free trade for nuts, as opposed to nut farmers, who would generally support trade barriers. In fact, one historical argument for United States salters is that importing nuts can encourage domestic production, since mixed nuts provide a \"wagon\" on which everyone's sales ride. For example, cashews are not produced in North America, and it is necessary to import them because mixed nuts are essential to the sale of pecans, which are grown exclusively in North America.\n\nBecause they are relatively inexpensive, peanuts are typically a major ingredient in mixed nuts, although they are viewed as less fancy than other nuts; often \"deluxe mixed nuts\" are advertised as containing no peanuts. \"Alrifai\", a brand in the Middle East, Identifies the expensive nuts as kernels. In 2006, a batch of \"deluxe\" mixed nuts was recalled because peanuts had crept into the mix. The move was not to save face: peanuts are the ingredient of mixed nuts most commonly associated with life-threatening food allergies.\nLess dramatically, some mixed nuts advertise themselves to contain \"less than 50% peanuts\". For a \"60 Minutes\" segment that originally aired in 1997, Andy Rooney tested such a can of Planters brand nuts, pleading boredom on a Saturday. He determined that \"there was a tiny fraction less than six ounces of peanuts . . . amazing precision for a nut factory.\" Later, in 2004, a cockeyed.com \"How much is inside?\" episode estimated that the peanut weight percentage in two such 11.5 oz cans was, in fact, a little over 50%.\n\nBesides peanuts, cashews are usually the next least expensive nut, and in deluxe mixes they tend to be the most common ingredient. Hazelnuts and Brazil nuts are also \"relatively cheap\", while pecans are the most expensive ingredient.\n\nThere are two different ways the nuts can be processed. The first is dry roasting, where heat is applied indirectly to the products. It is important that the nuts or seeds are stirred constantly to avoid over- and under-cooking. This method requires no additional ingredients. The second is oil frying, where the nuts go into preheated oil for a certain amount of time. There are various oil roasting methods from continuous, batch and curtain fryers. The ultimate impact on the nuts can vary; both methods are recommended by studies.\n\nPercent composition by weight is a serious matter in the U.S., where mixed nuts have been regulated by the Food and Drug Administration since 1977. Up to that point, the phrase \"mixed nuts\" had been legally meaningless. A 1964 \"Consumer Reports\" investigation of 124 cans of mixed nuts, representing 31 brands bought in 17 American cities, determined that most mixed nuts of the time were mostly peanuts, often 75%; peanutless brands were usually dominated by cashews. Many cans bore misleading labels or were underfilled. \"Consumer Reports\" concluded, \"What's needed of course is a Federal standard of identity...\", detailing a list that of requirements that, with the exception of their desire to limit broken nuts, anticipated the 1977 rules.\n\nOn March 15, 1977, the FDA promulgated a new standard of identity for mixed nuts in 42 FR 14475. The present standard, as modified by 58 FR 2885, Jan. 6, 1993, requires that mixed nuts must contain at least four different varieties of tree nuts or peanuts. (Products with three or fewer varieties are now commonly labelled as simply \"mixes\".) The container volume must be at least 85% filled, and the label must state whether any peanuts are unblanched or of the Spanish variety.\n\nThe most detailed section deals with weight percentages:\nFurthermore, if a variety X exceeds 50%, the label must conspicuously state \"contains up to 60% X\", and so on in 10% increments up to 80%. (The first example given by the FDA is \"contains up to 60% pecans\".) When testing mixed nuts for compliance, the FDA samples at least 24 pounds to reduce sampling error.\n\nModifying words like \"fancy\" or \"choice\" have not historically carried any legal meaning in the United States, and they remain absent from the current regulations. In a 1915 federal case against \"fancy mixed nuts\" that were argued by competitors to be an inferior grade, \"U. S. v. 25 Bags of Nuts,\" N. J. No. 4329 (1915), the court declined to accept a trade standard. The ruling said\n\n\n"}

It is unrecorded in the south east counties of Essex and Kent.\n\nThe main ingredients are freshly rendered lard, flour, sugar, spices, currants and raisins. Lardy cake can be eaten at any time of day as a snack, but is most commonly consumed in the afternoon with tea or coffee. Lardy cakes are very rich and sweet and eaten traditionally for special occasions, high days and holidays and harvest festivals.\n\nThe cake is made by layering thinly rolled dough with the other ingredients. As reported by the author Elizabeth David, a Hampshire cookbook advises that the cake be turned upside down after baking \"so the lard can soak through.\" It is theoretically possible to substitute butter for lard, but as Elizabeth David puts it: \"How could they be Lardy cakes without lard?\"\n\nA variation of the lardy cake is the dripping cake.\n\nThere is some dispute as to which area of England recorded the original recipe.

This is done both semesters, even during New England winters.\n\nSome of the streakers will \"dress up\" in capes and masks, or top hat and tails, or other costumes, but their genitalia are still exposed. The walkways through which students run are lined with spectators and the Harvard University Band plays beforehand to excite the crowd.\n\nBefore it became a \"night when the whole student body comes together to gawk at just that\" it was a night with a closer association to its name. Beginning in the 1960s students would congregate in the Yard or open their windows and just yell for 10 minutes. It was designed as a way to release stress. By the 1990s, the streaking aspect of the evening had become prominent. It is still designed to give stressed out students a chance to \"step outside the box.\"\n\nThe transition from yelling to streaking is unclear. Old administrators that have been at Harvard since the 1970s speak of an earlier day of adventurous streakers. Before there was streaking in the yard began the Quad Howl—streaking in what used to be old Radcliffe. These administrators of the Quad houses speculate that the change from the Quad to the Yard, which happened during their time, was because the narrow pathways of the Quad could not accommodate the increasing multitudes of people with an urge to get naked in public. The natural choice was to go join those in the Yard, giving them something to get excited about.\n\nA small tradition of Quad Howl continues today: after each Primal Scream, a few Quad residents return to the Quad for a naked lap there. Another related tradition is the Lingere Study Break where undergraduates in Lamont Library strip off their clothes, piece by piece, in front of hundreds of other students studying.\n\nWhile the records are not entirely clear, it appears that when Charles Adams, son of John Adams and brother of John Quincy Adams, was a student at Harvard, he and a few friends were disciplined for getting drunk and streaking naked across the Yard. He was later readmitted.\n\nThursday, December 11, 2014 at 12:00 midnight marked the first time that students ran the naked lap in a clockwise direction.

The rule is sensitive to pause, but not word boundary, so that (\"the house\") is realized as .\n\nIn a stressed syllable, , preceded by another stop, can occasionally be realized as true aspirates , especially if the stop is the same, for example (, \"note\"), (\"a casa\", \"at home\", with phonosyntactic strengthening due to the preposition).\n\nEstablishing a hierarchy of weakening within the class is not an easy task. Recent studies have called into question the traditional view that mutation of and is less widespread geographically than → , and in areas where the rule is not automatic, is often more likely to weaken than or .\n\nOn the other hand, deletion in rapid speech always affects first and foremost wherever it occurs, but reduces less often to , especially in the most common forms such as participles ( \"gone\"). Fricativisation of is by far the most perceptually salient of the three, however, and so it has become a stereotype of Tuscan dialects.\n\nThe phenomenon is more evident and finds its irradiation point in the city of Florence. From there, the gorgia spreads its influence along the entire Arno valley, losing strength nearer the coast. On the coast, and usually are not affected. The weakening of is a linguistic continuum in the entire Arno valley, in the cities of Prato, Pistoia, Montecatini Terme, Lucca, Pisa, Livorno.\n\nIn the northwest, it is present to some extent in Versilia. In the east, it extends over the Pratomagno to include Bibbiena and its outlying areas, where are sometimes affected, both fully occlusive and lenited (lax, unvoiced) allophones being the major alternates.\n\nThe Apennine Mountains are the northern border of the phenomenon, and while a definite southern border has not been established, it is present in Siena and further south to at least San Quirico d'Orcia. In the far south of Tuscany, it gives way to the lenition (laxing) typical of northern and coastal Lazio.\n\nThe \"Tuscan gorgia\" arose perhaps as late as the Middle Ages as a natural phonetic phenomenon, much like the consonant voicing that affected Northern Italian dialects and the rest of Western Romance (now phonemicised as in \"friend\" (f.) > ), but it remained allophonic in Tuscany, as laxing or voicing generally does elsewhere in Central Italy and in Corsica.\n\nAlthough it was once hypothesised that the \"gorgia\" phenomena are the continuation of similar features in the language that predated Romanization of the area, Etruscan, that view is no longer held by most specialists. Instead, it is increasingly accepted as being a local form of the same consonant weakening that affects other speech in Central Italy, extending far beyond, to Western Romance. Support for that hypothesis can be found in several facts:\n\n\n"}

It was re-released in its current shape (a stick of several individually wrapped candies) in February 1996.\n\nThe origins of Hi-Chew began when Taichiro Morinaga sought to create an edible kind of chewing gum that could be swallowed because of the Japanese cultural taboo against taking food out of one's mouth. Morinaga already produced caramel. By combining his chewy caramel with flavoring, Morinaga was able to create his new candy called Chewlets in 1931. Morinaga, whose business was hampered immensely by World War II, had to rebuild his company from scratch, and Chewlets were reintroduced in the form in which they are known today.\n\nHi-Chew candies are individually wrapped in logo-stamped foil or plain white wax paper (depending on the localization). Each individual candy piece consists of an outer white coating (this is the same for most flavors) and a colored, flavored interior. The exceptions to this rule are the Strawberry Cheesecake, Yogurt, and Cotton Candy flavors, which have an outer colored coating with a white, flavored inside, whereas the Cola flavored Hi-chews are brown colored. The texture is similar to a cross between chewing gum and fruit-flavored candies in the United States such as Mamba or Starburst, similar to the long discontinued Bonkers. Hi-Chew can be found widely in shops in Taiwan, Shanghai, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Specialist shops in other countries also stock this product, including most places in the United States, Cost Plus World Market locations, and also many import stores. In Walt Disney World's Epcot in Florida, Hi-Chew can be also found sold in a smaller package and translated into English. Special editions are sometimes released.\nHi-Chew's ingredients include: Glucose syrup, Sugar, Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Gelatin (derived from pork), Natural and Artificial Flavors, Strawberry juice from concentrate, DL-Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Emulsifiers, Sodium lactate Solution, and Natural colors (Beta-Carotene, Carmine). Hi-Chew is not kosher, halal, or vegetarian. Hi-Chew may contain soybeans. Product could also be processed in facilities with dairy products.\n\nAs the main ingredients are glucose and palm kernel oil, it is relatively simple to remove if it becomes stuck on clothing. By applying a warm, wet towel, the candy will soften and wash off.\n\nHi-Chew is available in twelve flavors in the United States: Strawberry, Green Apple, Mango, Grape, Peach, Banana, Melon, Cherry, Kiwi, Açai, and (exclusive to Hawaii) Pineapple and Lilikoi. Hi-Chew Sours and Hi-Chew Bites were released in February 2016 . Hi-Chew Sours are the sour version of the original stick and is being offered in lemon, lime, and grapefruit flavors. Hi-Chew Bites are soft chew candy blended with already established flavors, being offered in \"grape and strawberry\" and \"mango and orange\". Since its inception, over 131 flavors have been created. In the case that it cannot be found in stores, Hi-Chew can readily be found online for purchase. Currently, stores in the United States that carry Hi-Chew are primarily clustered on the West and East Coasts. A recent development with Hi-Chew is that it has become a gluten-free product. Though Hi-Chew itself never actually contained gluten ingredients, it is now produced in facilities that do not process other gluten containing products. However, this is only true for products that have a \"Best by\" date in 2012 or later. Hi-Chew contains gelatin ingredients derived from pork, so it is not halal, kosher, or vegetarian.\n\nMorinaga's American branch donated Hi-Chew in support of athletic programs in northern Utah and Los Angeles. Hi-Chew was donated to help fund raise for soccer and football programs in northern Utah high schools as well as football programs in Los Angeles county high schools. Morinaga donated a total of 7000 Hi-Chew sticks to the schools, with about 500 sticks going to each high school.\n\nIn early 2018, Hi-Chew began a contest known as \"East meets West\", in which user-submitted votes decided which of their Japanese line of flavors should be introduced to a Western audience. On April 11, 2018, Hi-Chew's Instagram account officially announced that Dragon Fruit had won the competition and would be coming to the United States the following year.\n\nIn 2008, Morinaga recalled some of its Hi-Chew products due to complaints that rubber-like material had been found in the candy. The source of this turned out to have come from a piece of a worker's glove that had fallen into the cooking vat as well as parts of a cow's intestine in the Hyogo Morinaga factory. A worker from Japan had reportedly been eating a cow's intestine while working in the factory. This was deemed unsanitary for America's standards and the worker was immediately fired. The worker filed a lawsuit in 2012 stating that Japan allowed the conditions he was under when the mistake happened. While that was true, he lost the case because America's standards for factory work were much more strict than Japan's. The green apple and grape flavored varieties of Hi-Chew that had a 2009 expiration date were recalled. Some of the affected products also had been exported to Hong Kong, where the Centre for Food Safety monitored the situation and warned the public against its purchase or consumption.\n\n\n"}

It may also be known as \"compound coating\" or \"chocolatey coating\" when used as a coating for candy. It is often used in less expensive candy bars to replace enrobed chocolate on a product. \n\nCocoa butter must be tempered to maintain gloss and coating. A chocolatier tempers chocolate by cooling the chocolate mass below its setting point, then rewarming the chocolate to between for milk chocolate, or between for semi-sweet chocolate. Compound coatings, however, do not need to be tempered. Instead, they are simply warmed to between above the coating's melting point.\n\n"}

This dough is covered with a wet cloth and left to stand for an hour or so in a warm place. The result is a slight leavening of the flour but not much. The flour is pummelled again by hand and then rolled out using a rolling pin into a flat, round shape. It is baked in an earthen clay oven (\"tandoor\") until done. When baked, it is often brushed with butter or ghee, although this is not necessary. It is then eaten with any Indian curry. In particular, a spicy chickpea curry known as \"chole\" is the dish of choice for being eaten with kulcha.\n\nInstead of using water to knead the dough, milk or yogurt can be used; this results in the dough becoming softer and more rubbery. This type of kulcha is known as \"doodhia kulcha\" (milk kulcha). Leavening is often greater if yogurt is used.\n\nTraditionally, kulchas are not stuffed but made plain and eaten with a curry which can be either vegetarian or meat-based. However, in recent years, kulchas stuffed with fillings are appearing in restaurant and shops, although they are never made at home. A range of stuffings, including paneer (cottage cheese), potatoes, onion and other vegetables are used.\n\nAmritsar, a city in Punjab, is famous for its Amritsari kulchas or Amritsari naan where many of these varieties are available. In Hyderabad, India, kulcha is also referred to as \"naan\" or \"sheermaal\".\nIn Pakistan, kulcha breads are largely eaten in certain parts of the Hazara and northern Punjab regions, where they are a popular breakfast item.\n\n"}

In the 17th century a practice known as \"moulding\" cockle-bread had a sexual connotation. Cockle bread is also mentioned in a 19th-century nursery rhyme.\n\nThe play \"The Old Wives' Tale\" by George Peele, first published in 1595, has a reference to \"cockle-bread\". The editor of a 20th-century edition of the play, Charles Whitworth, points to the \"cockle\" as a weed found in corn and wheat fields, and suggests that \"cockle-bread\" was possibly an inferior bread, made from those grains, with the weed mixed into it. William Carew Hazlitt writing in \"Faith and Folklore: a dictionary\" in 1905, gives the same explanation of \"Cockle Bread\" as Whitworth.\n\nIn the 17th century a sexual connotation is attached not to the bread itself but to \"a dance that involved revealing the buttocks and simulating sexual activity\" which was known as \"moulding\" cockle bread.\n\nJohn Aubrey writes of \"young wenches\" indulging in a \"wanton sport\" called \"moulding of Cocklebread\" where they would \"get upon a Tableboard, and as they gather-up their knees and their Coates with their hands as high as they can, and then they wabble to and fro with the Buttocks as if they were kneading of Dough with their Arses\". While doing this, the young women would sing the rhyme:\n\nAubrey compares this, writing \"I did imagine nothing to have been in this but mere wantonness of youth ... but I find in Buchardus's book Methodus Confitendi ... one of the articles of interrogating a young woman is, if she did ever subjugere panem clunibus, and then bake it, and give it to the one she loved to eat\". From this he decides \"I find it to be a relic of natural magic, an unlawful philtrum\" (i.e. aphrodisiac or love charm).\n\nWriting in \"A Dictionary of Sexual Language and Imagery in Shakespearean and Stuart Literature\", Gordon Williams sees Aubrey's \"wanton sport\" in a 1641 mention of moulding cocklebread, a \"sexual sense\" in a prayer mentioning the practice from 1683, and considers it \"transparent\" in the 1683 \"Fifteen Real Conforts Of Matrimony\" which \"tells how 'Mrs. Betty has been Moulding of Cockle-bread, and her mother discovers it'; the consequence is a 'By-blow in her belly'\".\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Cockle-Bread became the name of a children's game, played to a nursery rhyme in which the bread is mentioned:\n\nWriting in \"Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain\" in 1854, John Brand describes the nursery rhyme as \"modern\", but adds that its connection to the earlier \"moulding\" of cockle bread \"is by no means generally understood\".\n\n"}

It first appears in print with its current name in 1904, but identical recipes for 'hydropathic pudding' and 'Malvern pudding' from as far back as 1868 have been found.\n\nMaking summer pudding is much easier if the bread is somewhat stale. This helps the fruit juices soak through the bread, which makes the pudding more pleasant.

{"id": "5257261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5257261", "title": "Melaveh Malkah", "text": "Melaveh Malkah\n\nMelaveh Malkah (also, Melave Malka or Melava Malka) (, lit. \"Escorting the Queen\") is the name of a meal that, as per halakha, is customarily held by Jews after their Sabbath (Shabbat), in other words, on Saturday evening. The intent of the meal is to figuratively escort the \"Sabbath Queen\" (the traditional metaphor for Shabbat in Jewish liturgy) on her way out via musical performances, singing and eating, as one would escort a monarch upon his departure from a city. This meal is alternatively called \"the fourth meal.\"\n\nThe source for the custom is found in the Babylonian Talmud:\n\nA man shall always set his table after Shabbat — even though he needs but a ke'zayit of chamin [meaning, even though he is quite full and satisfied.\n\nThis custom is also referred to as \"Se'udata d'David Malka Meshicha\" (Aramaic: סעודתא דדוד מלכא משיחא), \"The meal of David, King Messiah.\" King David asked God when he would die and God revealed to him that he would die on a Shabbat. From that time on, David made a meal for the members of his household at the conclusion of each Shabbat to thank God that he was still alive.\n\nAccording to the \"Kaf Hachayim\", the \"luz\" bone — which is located at the base of the skull where the knot of the head tefillin is placed, and which God will use to \"reconstruct\" a person at the time of \"techias hameisim\" — is nourished solely from the meal of Melaveh Malkah (Kaf Hachayim 300:1-2).\n\nRabbi Isaac Luria is claimed to have said that the 'additional soul' () which is given to each Jew for the duration of each Shabbat does not leave a person until after the Melaveh Malkah. For this reason, many people refrain from work and remain in their Shabbat clothes until after Melaveh Malkah.\n\nThe eating of the Melaveh Malkah meal is said to be a \"segulah\" for easy childbirth, as well as for injecting blessings of health, wealth and spiritual gain into the following week.\n\nMelaveh Malkah is a mitzvah that is incumbent on both men and women. After the conclusion of Shabbat and the saying of Havdalah, a fresh tablecloth is spread and candles are lit for the meal of Melaveh Malkah. The meal should be eaten as close to the end of Shabbat as possible, although in cases of need one may delay it until later, but preferably no later than midnight. Some Hasidic rebbes would eat Melaveh Malkah on Sunday morning, but they would make sure to eat some food on Saturday night.\n\nIdeally, only food that was specifically prepared for the Melaveh Malkah meal should be served, rather than leftovers from Shabbat. One may fulfill the mitzvah by eating as little as a \"ke'zayit\" of bread. Some say that if one is not hungry, he may fulfill the custom of Melaveh Malkah by drinking a cup of fresh-brewed tea or coffee, or by eating a piece of cake or fruit.\n\nThose seeking to beautify the mitzvah prepare a special dish for this meal. The Talmud tells of the household of Rabbi Abbahu, in which they would slaughter a calf at the conclusion of each Shabbat and Rabbi Abbahu would eat one of its kidneys. When his son grew up, he asked why an additional calf had to be slaughtered after Shabbat especially for the Melaveh Malkah, when they could instead save the kidney from the calf that they regularly slaughtered for their Shabbat meals? His advice was well taken, and a bit of the Shabbat meat was set aside for the Melaveh Malkah. But then a lion came and devoured the calf, so that nothing was gained by the suggestion. This story appears in the Talmud to show that it is proper to beautify the mitzvah by preparing a special dish in honor of the Melaveh Malkah meal, and to not be satisfied with eating leftovers from the Shabbat foods.\n\nSpecial songs have been composed for singing at this meal, the most popular of which welcomes the coming of the Prophet Elijah, who will announce the advent of the Messianic age.\n\nMelaveh Malkah has become a popular venue for Saturday-night get-togethers among friends and larger group social events. Many Jewish organizations hold Melaveh Malkahs for hundreds of guests as a fundraising event.\n\n\n"}

The word was also used to describe the epitome of sacrificial rite, the complex and fraught main service of The High Priest on Yom Kippur (The Day of Atonement). Today it refers to a liturgical reenactment of the aforementioned ceremony which is recited during the Musaf Amidah of Yom Kippur.\n\nIn chassidism: Avodah generally refers to Divine service (or worship). For example, it's part of the Divine service to serve God with joy.\n\n\"eizohi \"Avodah\" shebelev? zu Teffilah.\" -translated as \"What is the service of the heart? That is teffilah, prayer.\" That is why in chassidism there is a great emphasis on prayer.\n\nAvodah is one of the two words that underlie the ideology of the Bnei Akiva movement. (The other is Torah).\n\nIn this ideological framework, the word was originally utilised in a strictly agricultural context. \"Avodah\" meant working on a kibbutz.\n\nIn more recent years, Bnei Akiva has had to redefine the terminology. Tens of thousands of its members currently live, or plan to live in an urban setting in Israel. Furthermore, it is generally perceived that the \"needs\" of Israel have developed somewhat since Bnei Akiva was founded. Draining malarial swamps and \"turning the desert green\" have assumed somewhat lower priorities than in earlier years. To give an example from exporting, Israel is now known for its high tech industries as much as for its Jaffa oranges.\n\nThe movement has therefore subtly redefined Avodah, to mean work that contributes towards the building up of the land of Israel.\n"}

In order to drive expansion, the company's first manufacturing plant was started in Calcutta. In 1970, a larger manufacturing plant was established in Jaipur. Another manufacturing plant was established in New Delhi, the capital of India, in the early 1990s. In 2003, the company began the process of developing convenience foods to be marketed to consumers. In 2014, Haldiram was ranked 55th among India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory.

In Sindh and Sindhi regions of India, it is called \"Layee\" or \"Lai\" and in Bangladesh, it is known as \"gur badam\". Similar dishes are also very popular in Brazil, where it is known as \"pé-de-moleque\", and in Paraguay, where it is called \"Ka'í Ladrillo\".\n\nSome chikkis are made using a combination of ingredients. Special chikkis are made out of cashews, almonds, and pistachios. Though jaggery is the usual sweetener material, sugar is used as the base in certain types of chikkis. It is a very popular sweet item in both rural and urban South Asia (spanning India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka). Some also add glucose to the chikkis, which are usual there. It started from a single flavor of jaggery and peanuts. And today there are different exotic flavors available in the market.\n\nIn the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the preparation is with a larger proportion of nuts to jaggery and the mixture is formed into balls and slabs. The most common versions are kadalai urundai (peanut balls), ellu urundai (sesame balls) and pori urundai (puffed rice balls). In Kerala, it is made in both slab and ball forms. Peanut based sweet is called as \"kadala mithai\" or \"kappalandi mithai\" or in some places as \"abhayaarthi katta\" . And the sesame based sweet is called as \"ellunda\".\n\nThe preparation of chikkis consists of first preparing the hot jaggery syrup with a minimum of water, adding nuts to the syrup to coat them (with the syrup) and then transferring the nuts to a wooden mould, then rolling them to a thickness of about 6–8 mm using a wooden roller, then placing into a steel plate for cooling, cutting into slabs, and packing. In homes, smaller quantities are hand rolled with wooden rollers.\n\nMost popular chikkis are sourced from the Indian towns of Kovilpatti, Lonavala, Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani Karjat in Maharashtra and Bhuj in Gujarat.\n\n"}

Such soups are usually based solely on broths and lacking in dairy products such as milk or cream. Thickening for the soups usually consists of refined starches from corn or sweet potatoes.\n\nAsian soups are generally categorized as either \"savoury\" or \"sweet\". The quality of a savoury soup is determined mainly by its fragrance and umami or \"\"xian\"\" flavour, as well as, to a lesser extent, its mouthfeel. Sweet soups such as \"tong sui\" are enjoyed for their aroma, mouthfeel, and aftertaste. Many soups are eaten and drunk as much for their flavour as for their health benefits and touted for their purported revitalizing or invigorating effects.\n\nSince many Asian soups are eaten as one of the main dishes in a meal or in some cases served straight with little adornment, particular attention is paid to the soups' stocks. In the case of some soups, the stock ingredients become part of the soup.\n\nThere are several basic traditional soup stocks in Chinese cuisine:\n\nIngredients used in making Chinese stocks can be recooked again to produce a thinner broth with less intense flavours, known as ().\n\nCollectively known as \"dashi\", most Japanese soup bases are flavoured primarily with \"kombu\" (kelp) and shavings from dried skipjack tuna (katsuobushi).

Mirin is occasionally added to the broth to further enhance the taste of the broth.\n\n\nKorean broth is collectively known as (K: T: ). Although the literal definition is meaty water, can be used to include broth made by vegetable equivalent.

Indonesian cuisine has a diverse variety of soups. Some Indonesian soups may be served as a separate whole meal, while others are lighter.\n\nGenerally Indonesian soups and stews are grouped into three major groups with numbers of variants in between. \n\n\nVietnamese cuisine features two basic categories of soup: noodle soups and broths (Vietnamese: canh).\n\nNoodle soups are enjoyed for both breakfast and dinner. Popular noodle soups include \"phở\", rice vermicelli (\"bún bò Huế\", \"bún mọc\", \"bún ốc\", \"Bún riêu cua\", \"bún suông\", etc.), \"mì\" (\"mì Quảng\" in Quảng Nam Province), \"bánh canh\", \"bánh đa cua\" (in Hai Phong province), \"nui\", and \"hủ tiếu\".\n\nBroths are thin and generally made from vegetables and spices.

Exotic rarities like tiger penis soup fall in this category. There are many varieties of such tonic soups, ranging from pungent to light in flavour, and from savoury to sweet.

Adobada is generally pork marinated in a \"red\" chile sauce with vinegar and oregano, but it can refer to different types of meat and to marinades closer to al pastor. It is generally served on small, pliable corn maize tortilla along with sautéed vegetables and cheese.\n\n\"Carne adovada\" is a baked meat dish that is a specialty in New Mexican cuisine. In its simplest form, raw pork is cut into strips or cubes and placed in a large plastic bag with New Mexico red chili powder or minced red chili peppers (Hatch or guajillo chili peppers), garlic, oregano, cumin, lime/lemon juice and/or vinegar, and salt, then mixed and refrigerated overnight. The dish is cooked by baking at low heat wrapped completely in foil or in a covered dish like a casserole dish to keep the meat moist.\nThe southern New Mexican version is usually pork cut into strips and chunks. Historically, before refrigeration, the pork was fermented in red chile in a crock using the same bacterial cultures as in yogurt (but it is not dairy). Fermented meat was a way of preservation and imparted a \"sour\" taste to the pork which explains why modern New Mexican adovada recipes call for a bit of white vinegar or lemon/lime juice. The red chile is prepared \"con pellejo\" with bits of the chile skin using spices of fresh minced garlic, mortar and pestle ground oregano, comino (cumin), cilantro, and coriander seeds that may or may not be toasted. The dish is then baked until the meat is tender, moist and succulent on the inside while encrusted with a semidry and crisp red chile exterior that is almost blackened. Other versions of red chile and boiled or braised pork may be claimed as carne adovada. Other versions of red chili and pork sin pellejo are actually what is known as chile Colorado. Carne adovada may be served with a tortilla, beans and rice, fideos or homefries, or papas with a fresh vinegar slaw or salad.\n\nAnother version is found in central New Mexico. Chunks of pork are dipped in milk and rolled in a dry rub of red chili con pellejo, garlic powder, salt, and comino. These are tossed into a large fry pot with chicharrónes and deep fried until crisp on the outside and tender and succulent inside.\n\nIn certain states in Mexico, carne adobada refers to marinated pork meat. It is a very common ingredient for tacos, in the area of Colima, Jalisco and Michoacán states. In some parts of the state of Guerrero, it is known as \"carne enchilada\" which means chili dressed meat. In the \"Huasteca\" area (San Luis Potosí, Tampico, Veracruz and Hidalgo) it may be called \"cecina enchilada\". Cecina stands for the thin cut steaks. Most of the Mexican variations of adobada use guajillo or chipotle chiles for the marinade, both of which can be very hot and spicy.\n\nThe combination of spices, chiles, and vinegar used for the marinade is called \"adobo\". Numerous recipes and regional variations for the adobo seasoning impart different flavors to carne adobada. Many carne adobada recipes from Mexico use the spices allspice, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaf, and/or nutmeg, which are not typically used in the New Mexico-style dish.\n"}

It was probably made in Constantinople for the tenth anniversary (decennalia) in 388 of the reign of the Emperor Theodosius I, the last Emperor to rule both the Eastern and Western Empires. It is one of the best surviving examples of Late Antique Imperial imagery and one of the finest examples of late Roman goldsmith work. It is the largest and most elaborate, and the most famous, of the 19 surviving vessels believed to represent \"largitio\" (\"largesse\") or a \"ceremonial gift given by the emperor to a civil or military official\".\n\nThe dish shows a hieratic image of the Emperor framed in an arcade, giving a document contained in a diptych, possibly a letter of appointment, to a much smaller senior official, flanked by his two co-emperors, Valentinian II and his own son Arcadius, and bodyguards who can be identified by their hairstyles, torcs and shields as belonging to the German imperial bodyguard. The official receives the document with hands covered by his chlamys (cloak).\n\nTheodosius is shown far larger than the other figures, as is common in the hieratic Late Antique style, despite the fact that Valentinian II had been an Emperor for longer (he in turn is significantly larger than Arcadius or the unknown official). The three emperors have haloes which is usual at this period. \nTheir clothing is early Byzantine dress consistent with other Imperial portraits of the period. The two co-emperors have decorated \"tablions\" (patches showing rank attached to their main garment) at their knees, or possibly Epigonations (unattached ceremonial \"handkerchiefs\", which survive as an Eastern Orthodox vestment). These would have been highly decorated with embroidery and probably jewels.\n\nThe official receiving the document wears clothes decorated with stripes and patches which would have been a kind of uniform for his office. The three Imperial figures have tightly curled hairstyles, and wear diadems of pearls. Their cloaks are fastened with large circular jewelled fibulae, comparable to that worn by Justinian in the mosaic at San Vitale, Ravenna, while the official has a \"crossbow\" fibula.\n\nThe architectural surround has often been compared to a peristyle at Diocletian's Palace in Split, Croatia, where the emperor retired after abdicating his powers. This opens from the imperial residence to a courtyard that has been regarded as a setting for ceremonial audiences such as the one shown on the dish, but this interpretation is uncertain.\n\nBelow the groundline of the imperial scene there is a scene of putti offering garlands and other objects, up to the Emperor above; with the two on the pediment above, there are five in total, and various significances have been given to this number, as representing years, \"dioceses\" of the Eastern Empire, or other things. Their offerings are held in hand-cloths, just as the official uses his clothes to receive his gift; it was not considered respectful to hold bare hands out to the emperor.\n\nThe putti fly above a reclining figure of Tellus or Terra, the Roman goddess of \"Mother Earth\". Vaguer figures from Roman mythology such as personifications, putti, and winged victories continued to be acceptable in Christian art of the Roman elite, and apparently retained for reasons of what we might call \"cultural heritage\", where representations of specific major deities were not. Tellus is shown in a pose that continues Hellenistic style, rather than the frontal iconic Late Antique style of the figures in the upper zone.\n\nThe missorium comes from a treasure of silver objects that also included two plain silver cups, now missing, discovered by a labourer in 1847 in Almendralejo, close to Mérida in the Spanish province of Badajoz. When found it was folded flat along the line of the diagonal cut that now divides it into two pieces, which was made as part of an attempt to restore it, though an attempt at a cut along the same line may also have been made in antiquity. It is in good condition apart from the areas affected by this, but that it was folded may suggest it was being treated as bullion when deposited. The height of the silver relief varies, and is highest in the face of Theodosius and other highlights of the composition; much of the detail on the clothing is engraved.\n\nThe dish is one of the most beautiful examples of silversmith's work of imperial largesse, that is to say of the category of luxury articles made for imperial celebrations such as accession to the throne and anniversaries and given on these occasions by the emperor to high-ranking dignitaries of the empire: they were mainly dishes, plates, cups, and bowls in silver. The recipient may well be the official represented on the dish (possibly a generalized figure, especially if the design was made in several copies, which we cannot judge), and the find-spot in Spain, Theodosius's home province, suggests it was one of his Spanish friends or relations.\n\nA \"missorium\" is a large dish or shallow bowl that could be used in ceremonial washing of hands and face in both secular and pagan and Christian religious contexts, though this dish is too flat to be very useful for this, and was probably intended mainly to be displayed as a sign of wealth and imperial favour. The term now tends to be avoided by scholars, as rather imprecise, but has become traditional in the case of the dish in Madrid. This is made of solid silver and has traces of gilding on the inscriptions. Its size is exceptional compared to other contemporary silver dishes, measuring 74 cm in diameter with a thickness which varies between 4 and 8 mm. It rests on a ring, 3 cm thick with a diameter of 26 cm, which was welded to the base. This ring has a Greek inscription specifying the official weight of the object:\n\nποc ↑Ν ΜεΤ i.e. ποσότης λιτρῶν 50 μετάλλου (“50 metal pounds”)\n\nThe 50 \"pounds\" correspond to an official weight of 16.13 kg of silver, whereas the dish actually weighs only 15.35 kg; the difference could be because the dish was weighed and marked before being decorated: a piece of the dish is also missing. The decoration, at the same time engraved and with repoussé decoration (pushed out from the back), would have removed a little metal, although this is unlikely to account for the whole difference.\nThe subject of the decoration is the emperor enthroned with his co-reigning emperors. An inscription along the side of the rim makes it possible to identify him with certainty:\n\nD(ominus) N(oster) THEODOSIVS PERPET(uus)AVG(ustus)OB DIEM FELICISSIMVM X \n\nthat is to say: “Our Lord Theodosius, emperor forever, on the most happy occasion of the tenth anniversary (of his reign).”\n\nThe inscription indicates that the dish was made at the time of the decennalia of an emperor named Theodosius.. The presence of two co-regents makes it possible to exclude immediately Theodosius II, for he had one co-regent — his uncle Flavius Honorius — at the time of the tenth anniversary of his reign, celebrated in 412. This leaves the decennalia of Theodosius I, on January 19 388. It was celebrated when the emperor was staying at Thessaloniki from September 387 to April 388. Some have concluded that the missorium was the work of a Thessalonician workshop, but it is more likely that it was ordered from the Imperial workshops in Constantinople; others think that the imperial workshop would have followed the emperor around on his travels.\n\nFew examples of this imperial silver have survived; only nineteen items, all dating from the 4th century and produced for six different emperors, though ten are for Licinius. In this series, the missorium of Theodosius I is distinguished because it is both the latest - although the practice probably continued for a further two centuries - and because it carries the most elaborate decoration: the only other well-preserved examples are the \"Kerch plate\", preserved at the Hermitage Museum in St Petersberg, showing Constantius II on horseback, and that of Valentinian I or Valentinian II in Geneva. A fragment from a treasure found at Groß Bodungen was probably the closest to the missorium of Theodosius I in design, but is too damaged to allow an identification or a precise dating. Rather more examples have survived of aristocratic, rather than imperial silver, such as the Mildenhall Treasure probably dating from a few years earlier, or the Sevso Treasure.\n\nJutta Meischner relocates the Missorium of Theodosius to the 5th century AD, to the year 421. She argues, that the emperor is Theodosius II, flanked by Honorius to the right and Valentinian III to the left. Meischner constitutes this interpretation by describing the Missorium as a work of distinctive style, quality of execution and workmanship seen in exemplary examples of Western Roman Empire. She argues that features like these are not consistent with the era of Theodosius I. \n\nHowever, Meischner bases her argument on the inscription mentioning a tenth imperial anniversary was intended to celebrate the continuation of the dynasty ten years after coming to power Theodosius II in 418 AD, following his father Arcadius’ death in 408 AD. On the basis of the epigraphic evidence (a XV, as proposed by Alicia Canto, see above and below), she believes that it was most likely commissioned by Galla Placidia and produced in Ravenna in around 421 AD as a gift to her nephew Theodosius II. She concedes the reading of the Roman numerals inscribed on the missorium by Alicia Canto in her detailed study (that was presented in the same Madrid conference), as ‘quindecennalia’ the fifteenth imperial anniversary, as opposed to the common reading of \"decennalia\", gives us of a new perspective and reassessment of the history, the circumstances of the Missorium’s commission by Galla Placidia and its intended functions and unresolved provenance.\n\nThe dish is a leading example of the style of the so-called \"Theodosian Renaissance\", along with the base of the Obelisk of Theodosius in Istanbul and the fragments surviving of his triumphal column there. This is the first stylistic phase that can be clearly linked with the new capital of Constantinople, and according to Ernst Kitzinger: \"One senses that some strong artistic personality or personalities who set the tone and aesthetic standards were active at the centre of political power, stamping the monuments of this period with an unmistakable imprint\".\n\nDespite limitations in terms of anatomical correctness, and a \"soft, rubbery quality\" in the nude bodies, the style has \"an element of studied classicism\" as well as \"an insistence on clear, continuous and simplified outline, on neatness and regularity\" in the figure of \"Terra/Tellus\", so that \"Classicist form is oddly paired with linear abstract order\", the latter more prominent in the upper zone, to lend an air of authority and \"timelessness and absolute stability\" to the imperial figures that was not required below.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5327145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5327145", "title": "Terry's", "text": "Terry's\n\nTerry's was a British chocolate and confectionery maker based in York, England. It was founded in 1767 and in 1993 it was taken over by Kraft Foods. The company's headquarters, later renamed The Chocolate Works factory, was closed by Kraft in 2005; products using the Terry's brand name are now produced in Kraft facilities in Poland, Sweden, Belgium, and Slovakia. The Terry's name became part of Mondelēz International in 2012 and part of Carambar & Co in 2016. Their best known products include Terry's Chocolate Orange (1931), and Terry's All Gold box of assorted chocolates, which was also introduced in the 1930s.\n\nThe business began in 1767 as a shop close to Bootham Bar, York, selling cough lozenges, lemon and orange candied peel, and other sweets. When Robert Berry formed a partnership with William Bayldon the firm took the name Bayldon and Berry and by 1818 the business had moved to St Helen’s Square, York.\n\nJoseph Terry, who was born in Pocklington in 1793, went to York to serve as an apprentice apothecary in either Stonegate or Spurriergate. On gaining his certificates, he set up as a chemist, firstly ‘opposite the castle’ before moving to Walmgate. In 1823 he married Harriet Aktinson, who was either a niece or sister-in-law of Robert Berry and after closing his chemist shop he joined the Berry confectionary business, from which William Bayldon had retired in 1821.\n\nIn 1825, after the death of Robert Berry, Terry agreed to a new partnership with George Berry; they renamed the business Terry & Berry. The partnership was joined by John Coultherd, but in 1828 George left and the business was renamed Joseph Terry and Company. Two years later Coultherd also left and Terry became the sole owner of the business.\n\nUsing the skills he learned as a chemist, Joseph developed new lines of chocolate, confectionery, sugared sweets, candied peel, marmalade, and medicated lozenges. He began using the developing railway network of the North Eastern Railway to distribute his products in the North of England and in London.\n\nAfter Joseph Terry died in 1850 the company was in the control of solicitors and executors until 1854 when it was handed over to his sons Joseph Jnr, Robert, and John. Joseph quickly expanded the business; four years later he moved production to a leased site at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse. This allowed easy shipment of raw products into the new production facility from the Humber Estuary; twice weekly a steam ship brought ingredients, including sugar and cocoa, as well as coal to power the new steam-powered machinery. Joseph was knighted for his services to industry in 1887 and became Lord Mayor of York for the fourth time in 1890. He renamed the business Joseph Terry & Sons and it became a limited liability company in 1895. The Grade II listed St Helen's Square premises was retained by the company as a shop and restaurant until 1980 after which it was sold and the restaurant was converted into offices.\n\nWhen Sir Joseph died in 1898 he was succeeded by his sons Frank and Thomas Terry and the following year Terry's Neapolitans were launched. Thomas died following a road accident in 1910 and his son Noel joined the company the following year. In the First World War Noel served in France until he was wounded and later joined his uncle Frank who had been seconded to the Ministry of Pensions. Henry Ernest Leetham, a York businessman and the father-in-law of Noel Terry became chairman of Terry's from 1915 until his death in 1923 at which point Frank and Noel Terry resumed family control of the business. They restructured the company, launched new products, and bought a site in Bishopthorpe Road, York, on which to develop a new factory known as Terry's Chocolate Works. The new factory was built in an Art Deco style and included a distinctive clock tower. It was opened in 1926; new products included the Chocolate Apple (1926), Terry's Chocolate Orange (1931), and Terry's All Gold, which were developed and produced onsite.\n\nWith the onset of the Second World War The factory was taken over by F. Hills and Sons of Manchester as a shadow factory to manufacture and repair aircraft propeller blades. Confectionery production continued but was done for other companies; the Clementhorpe factory produced jellies for Chivers and Sons whilst chocolate was manufactured for Charbonnel et Walker. Production also included chocolate for troop and lifeboat rations.\n\nAfter the war ended, the factory was handed back to the company. Production was difficult because of rationing and limited imports of raw cocoa. As a result, in 1954 production of the chocolate apple was phased out in favour of increased production of the chocolate orange. The Colgate-Palmolive Company acquired Joseph Terry & Sons Ltd. from Trust House Forte Ltd. in 1977. \nUnited Biscuits (Holdings) Ltd. (UB) acquired Joseph Terry & Sons Ltd. from Colgate in 1982; Terry's formed the bulk of their confectionery division. After UB ran into financial difficulties in the 1990s, they sold their confectionery division to Kraft Foods in 1993. Kraft amalgamated Terry's with Jacobs Suchard to create Terry's Suchard.\n\nFrom 2000, the company brand was changed from Terry's of York to Terry's, reducing the company's links with York. Production was also scaled back to UK products and Terry's Chocolate Orange, Terry's All Gold, and Twilight made for the international market. \n\nIn 2004, Kraft Foods decided to absorb Terry's, move production of remaining products such as All Gold and Chocolate Orange to factories in Belgium, Sweden, Poland, and Slovakia, and close the plant. The factory closed on 30 September 2005 with the loss of 316 jobs. \n\nIn 2012, Kraft split into two companies; one called Kraft Foods Group and the other called Mondelēz International. After the split, Terry's became part of Mondelēz. In 2016, Terry's was one of a number of brands acquired by Eurazeo and it subsequently became part of Carambar & Co.\n\nThe business was based in St Helen’s Square as early as 1818 in a building that served as both a shop and a factory until 1864 when production moved to the Clementhorpe site. The building was remodelled to include a ballroom and restaurant and in 1922 an Ashlar stone facade was added which included Corinthian columns and the name Terry was inscribed on the front of the building This inscription is still present in 2019.\nThe premises was Grade II listed in 1974 but both the shop and restaurant closed in early 1981 and it was bought by the neighbouring Trustee Savings Bank who converted the restaurant into offices.\nHowever it reopened as a restaurant in March 2017 and in August 2017 a blue plaque in honour of Joseph Terry the elder was added by York Civic Trust and unveiled by his great-great-great-grandson Anthony Terry.\n\nThe Clementhorpe factory was initially leased by the business in 1858 on what was the site of a former brewery and a new chocolate factory was built in 1862. A new five-storey building was added in 1920 and the factory continued to operate even after the business expanded to Bishopthorpe Road. \nAfter the factory closed the chimney was pulled down in 1974 and the rest of the site demolished in 1987. A Roman mosaic was discovered on the site at this time that Peter Terry had excavated to be preserved by the Yorkshire Museum.\n\nIn 1924 work began on the construction of the Terry’s Chocolate Works on Bishopthorpe Road, York. The buildings designed by architect J. E. Wade and built by Dorman Long included a tall clock tower and the five-storey long main factory building. These, along with the head office building were designated Grade II listed in March 2005 six months before the site closed.\nThe site was bought by developers Grantside and renamed The Chocolate Works. In February 2010, planning permission for a £165 million redevelopment of the site as a mixed-use of residential, commercial and leisure was given. Redevelopment started in 2011 with the removal of asbestos and the demolition of non-scheduled buildings in early 2012.\nThe main factory building underwent a £38 million redevelopment in which it was renamed as The Residence and the first apartments were made available in 2016. The main office building was converted into The Chocolate Works Care Village which opened in 2017.\n\nSir Joseph Terry was Lord Mayor of York in 1874, 1885–86 and 1890.\n\nSir Francis Terry (Frank Terry) was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1945–46 and Peter Terry, son of Noel Terry, was High Sheriff of North Yorkshire in 1980–81.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5348351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5348351", "title": "Mate (drink)", "text": "Mate (drink)\n\nMate (, ; sometimes spelled maté in English though not in Spanish or Portuguese), also known as chimarrão () or cimarrón (), is a traditional South American caffeine-rich infused drink, that was first consumed by the Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people. In the last centuries, it became particularly popular in Argentina and Uruguay, as also in Paraguay, the Bolivian Chaco, Southern Chile and Southern Brazil. It is also consumed in Syria, the largest importer in the world, and in Lebanon.\n\nIt is prepared by steeping dried leaves of yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\", known in Portuguese as \"erva-mate\") in hot water and is served with a metal straw from a shared hollow calabash gourd. The straw is called a \"bombilla\" in Spanish, a \"bomba\" in Portuguese, and a \"bombija\" or, more generally, a \"masassa\" (straw) in Arabic. The straw is traditionally made of silver. Modern, commercially available straws are typically made of nickel silver (called \"alpaca\"), stainless steel, or hollow-stemmed cane. The gourd is known as a \"mate\" or a \"guampa\"; while in Brazil, it has the specific name of \"cuia\", or also \"cabaça\" (the name for Indigenous-influenced calabash gourds in other regions of Brazil, still used for general food and drink in remote regions). Even if the water is supplied from a modern thermos, the infusion is traditionally drunk from \"mates\" or \"cuias\".\n\nThe mate leaves are dried, chopped, and ground into a powdery mixture called \"yerba\", \"erva\" in Portuguese, which means \"herb\". The bombilla functions as both a straw and a sieve. The submerged end is flared, with small holes or slots that allow the brewed liquid in, but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture. A modern bombilla design uses a straight tube with holes, or a spring sleeve to act as a sieve.\n\n\"Tea-bag\" type infusions of mate (Spanish: \"mate cocido\", Portuguese: \"chá mate\") have been on the market in many South American countries for many years under such trade names as \"Taragüi\" in Argentina, \"Pajarito\" and \"Kurupí\" in Paraguay, and Matte Leão and \"Mate Real\" in Brazil.\n\nMate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people who lived in that part of southern Brazil and northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is \"Ilex paraguariensis\". The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata and from there to Chile. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef. Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in the Paraguayan department of Misiones, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild strands. After their expulsion in the 1770s, the Jesuit missions — along with the yerba mate plantations — fell into ruins. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically.\n\nBrazil then became the largest producer of mate. In Brazilian and Argentine projects in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the plant was domesticated once again, opening the way for plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention to coffee in the 1930s, Argentina, which had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting the economy of Misiones Province, where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations. For years, the status of largest producer shifted between Brazil and Argentina.\n\nToday, Argentina is the largest producer with 56–62%, followed by Brazil, 34–36%, and Paraguay, 5%. Uruguay is the largest consumer per capita, consuming around 19 liters per year.\n\nBoth the spellings \"mate\" and \"maté\" are used in English. An acute accent is not used in the Spanish spelling, because it would incorrectly indicate that the second syllable is stressed; an accent on the \"e\" sometimes seen in English is used to indicate that the word and its pronunciation are distinct from the English word \"mate\". As the Yerba Mate Association of the Americas points out, with the accent the word \"maté\" in Spanish means \"I killed\".\n\nIn Brazil, traditionally prepared mate is known as \"chimarrão\", although the word \"mate\" and the expression \"\"mate amargo\"\" (bitter mate) are also used in Argentina and Uruguay. The Spanish \"cimarrón\" means \"rough\", \"brute\", or \"barbarian\", but is most widely understood to mean \"feral\", and is used in almost all of Latin America for domesticated animals that have become wild. The word was then used by the people who colonized the region of the Río de la Plata to describe the natives' rough and sour drink, drunk with no other ingredient to soften the taste.\n\nMate has a strong cultural significance both in terms of national identity and well as socially. Mate is the national drink of Argentina; Paraguay, where it is also consumed with either hot or ice cold water (see tereré); and Uruguay. Drinking mate is a common social practice in parts of Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and eastern Bolivia. Throughout the Southern Cone, it is considered to be a tradition taken from the \"gauchos\" or\" vaqueros\", terms commonly used to describe the old residents of the South American \"pampas\", \"chacos\", or Patagonian grasslands, found principally in parts of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southeastern Bolivia, southern Chile and southern Brazil.\n\nParque Histórico do Mate, funded by the state of Paraná (Brazil), is a park aimed to educate people on the sustainable harvesting methods needed to maintain the integrity and vitality of the oldest wild forests of mate in the world.\n\nMate is also consumed as an iced tea in various regions of Brazil, originating both from an industrialized form, produced by Matte Leão, and from artisanal producers. It is part of the beach culture in Rio de Janeiro, where it is widely sold by beach vendors, being the hot infused variation uncommon in the area.\n\nThe preparation of mate is a simple process, consisting of filling a container with yerba, pouring hot, but not boiling, water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the \"bombilla\", which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves. The method of preparing the mate infusion varies considerably from region to region, and which method yields the finest outcome is debated. However, nearly all methods have some common elements. The beverage is traditionally prepared in a gourd recipient, also called \"mate\" or \"guampa\" in Spanish and \"cuia\" in Portuguese, from which it is drunk. The gourd is nearly filled with \"yerba\", and hot water, typically at , never boiling, is added. The drink is so popular within countries that consume it, that several national electric kettle manufacturers just refer to the range 70 to 85 °C on its thermostat as \"mate\" temperature.\n\nThe most common preparation involves a careful arrangement of the \"yerba\" within the gourd before adding hot water. In this method, the gourd is first filled one-half to three-quarters of the way with \"yerba\". Too much \"yerba\" will result in a \"short\" mate; conversely, too little \"yerba\" results in a \"long\" mate, both being considered undesirable. After that, any additional herbs (\"yuyo\", in Portuguese \"jujo\") may be added for either health or flavor benefits, a practice most common in Paraguay, where people acquire herbs from a local \"yuyera\" (herbalist) and use the mate as a base for their herbal infusions. When the gourd is adequately filled, the preparer typically grasps it with the full hand, covering and roughly sealing the opening with the palm. Then the mate is turned upside-down, and shaken vigorously, but briefly and with gradually decreasing force, in this inverted position. This causes the finest, most powdery particles of the \"yerba\" to settle toward the preparer's palm and the top of the mate.\n\nOnce the \"yerba mate\" has settled, the mate is carefully brought to a near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a side-to-side motion. This further settles the \"yerba mate\" inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the \"yerba\" is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of \"yerba\" on the other.\n\nAfter arranging the \"yerba\" along one side of the gourd, the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the \"yerba\" as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of \"yerba\" should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the \"yerba\" (though at least a portion should remain in place).\n\nAll of this careful settling of the \"yerba\" ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible, creating a smooth-running mate. The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the straw. With each draw, the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the straw, but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out. A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the mate.\n\nNow the mate is ready to receive the straw. Wetting the \"yerba\" by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top, and then allowing it to be absorbed into the \"yerba\" before adding the straw, allows the preparer to carefully shape and \"pack\" the \"yerba\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s slope with the straw's filtering end, which makes the overall form of the \"yerba\" within the gourd more resilient and solid. Dry \"yerba\", though, allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the straw, but care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the \"yerba\". Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference. The straw is inserted with one's thumb on the upper end of the gourd, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the \"yerba\", so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the \"yerba\" and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd. It is important for the thumb to form a seal over the end of the straw when it is being inserted, or the negative pressure produced will draw in undesirable particulates.\n\nAfter the above process, the \"yerba\" may be brewed. If the straw is inserted into dry \"yerba\", the mate must first be filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than two or three minutes). Treating the \"yerba\" with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the \"yerba mate\" from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the \"yerba\", until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the \"yerba\" is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the \"yerba\" beside the edge of the gourd's opening.\n\nOnce the hot water has been added, the mate is ready for drinking, and it may be refilled many times before becoming \"lavado\" (washed out) and losing its flavor. When this occurs, the mound of \"yerba\" can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other, allowing water to be added along its opposite side; this revives the mate for additional refillings and is called \"\"reformar o/el mate\"\" (reforming the mate).\n\nMate is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. The same gourd (\"cuia\") and straw (\"bomba/bombilla\") are used by everyone drinking. One person (known in Portuguese as the \"preparador\", \"cevador\", or \"patrão\", and in Spanish as the \"cebador\") assumes the task of server. Typically, the \"cebador\" fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality. In some places, passing the first brew of mate to another drinker is considered bad manners, as it may be too cold or too strong; for this reason, the first brew is often called \"mate del zonzo\" (\"mate\" of the fool). The \"cebador\" possibly drinks the second filling, as well, if he or she deems it too cold or bitter. The \"cebador\" subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the drinker to his or her right, who likewise drinks it all (there is not much; the mate is full of yerba, with room for little water), and returns it without thanking the server; a final \"gracias\" (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. The only exception to this order is if a new guest joins the group; in this case the new arrival receives the next mate, and then the cebador resumes the order of serving, and the new arrival will receive his or hers depending on his placement in the group. When no more tea remains, the straw makes a loud sucking noise, which is not considered rude. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this way until the mate becomes \"lavado\" (washed out), typically after the gourd has been filled about 10 times or more depending on the \"yerba\" used (well-aged \"yerba mate\" is typically more potent, so provides a greater number of refills) and the ability of the \"cebador\". When one has had one's fill of mate, he or she politely thanks the \"cebador\", passing the mate back at the same time. It is impolite for anyone but the cebador to move the bombilla or otherwise mess with the mate; the cebador may take exception to this and not offer it to the offender again. When someone takes too long, others in the round (\"roda\" in Portuguese, \"ronda\" in Spanish) will likely politely warn him or her by saying \"bring the talking gourd\" (\"cuia de conversar\"); an Argentine equivalent, especially among young people, being \"no es un micrófono\" (\"it's not a microphone\"), an allusion to the drinkers holding the mate for too long, as if they were using it as a microphone to deliver a lecture.\n\nSome drinkers like to add sugar or honey, creating \"mate dulce\" or \"mate doce\" (sweet mate), instead of sugarless \"mate amargo\" (bitter mate), a practice said to be more common in Brazil outside its southernmost state. Some people also like to add lemon or orange peel, some herbs or even coffee, but these are mostly rejected by people who like to stick to the \"original\" mate.\nTraditionally, natural gourds are used, though wood vessels, bamboo tubes, and gourd-shaped \"mates\", made of ceramic or metal (stainless steel or even silver) are also common. The gourd is traditionally made out of the porongo or cabaça fruit shell. Gourds are commonly decorated with silver, sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs. Some gourd mates with elaborated silver ornaments and silver bombillas are true pieces of jewelry and very sought after by collectors.\n\nA review of a number of population studies in 2009 revealed evidence of an association between esophageal cancer and hot mate drinking, but these population studies may not be conclusive. Some research has suggested the correlation with esophageal cancer results almost entirely from damage caused to the esophagus by burns from the hot liquid as opposed to damage caused by chemicals in the mate; similar links to cancer have been found for tea and other beverages generally consumed at high temperatures. While drinking mate at very high temperatures is considered as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" on the IARC Group 2A carcinogens list, mate itself is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.\n\nResearchers from NCI (National Cancer Institutes) and Brazil found both cold- and hot-water extractions of popular commercial yerba mate products contained high levels (8.03 to 53.3 ng/g dry leaves) of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (i.e. benzo[a]pyrene). However, these potential carcinogenic compounds originated from the commercial drying process of the mate leaves, which involves smoke from the burning of wood, much like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in wood-smoked meat. \"Unsmoked\" or steamed varieties of yerba mate tea are also available.\n\nMate contains B and C vitamins, polyphenol antioxidants, and has a slightly higher antioxidant capacity than green tea. On average, mate tea contains 92 mg of the antioxidant chlorogenic acid per gram of dry leaves, and no catechins, giving it a significantly different antioxidant profile from other teas.\n\nThe Guaraní people started drinking mate in a region that currently includes Paraguay, southern Brazil, southeastern Bolivia, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay. The Guaraní have a legend that says the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it, but they instead found a \"yaguareté\" (jaguar) that was going to attack them. An old man saved them, and, in compensation, the goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant, from which he could prepare a \"drink of friendship\".\n\nAnother drink can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves, very cold water, and, optionally, lemon or another fruit juice, called \"tereré\". It is very common in Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. After pouring the water, it is considered proper to \"wait while the saint has a sip\" before the first person takes a drink. In southern Brazil, \"tererê\" is sometimes used as a derogatory term for a not hot enough \"chimarrão\".\n\nIn Uruguay and Brazil, the traditional gourd is usually big with a corresponding large hole. In Argentina (especially in the capital Buenos Aires), the gourd is small and has a small hole and people sometimes add sugar for flavor.\n\nIn Uruguay, people commonly walk around the streets toting a mate and a thermos with hot water. In some parts of Argentina, gas stations sponsored by \"yerba mate\" producers provide free hot water to travelers, specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey. Disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and straw and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case are available.\n\nIn Argentina, \"mate cocido\" (boiled mate), in Brazil, \"chá mate\", is made with a teabag or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug, with or without sugar and milk. Companies such as Cabrales from Mar del Plata and Establecimiento Las Marías produce teabags for export to Europe.\nTravel narratives, such as Maria Graham's \"Journal of a Residence in Chile\", show a long history of mate drinking in central Chile. Many rural Chileans drink mate, in particular in the southern regions, particularly Magallanes, Aysén and Chiloé.\n\nIn some parts of Syria, Lebanon and other Eastern Mediterranean countries, drinking mate is common. The custom came from Syrians and Lebanese who moved to South America during the late 19th and early parts of the 20th century, adopted the tradition, and kept it after returning to Western Asia. Syria is the biggest importer of yerba mate in the world, importing 15,000 tons a year. Mostly, the Druze communities in Syria and Lebanon maintain the culture and practice of mate.\n\nAccording to a major retailer of mate in San Luis Obispo, California, by 2004, mate had grown to about 5% of the overall natural tea market in North America. Loose mate is commercially available in much of North America. Bottled mate is increasingly available in the United States. Canadian bottlers have introduced a cane sugar-sweetened, carbonated variety, similar to soda pop. One brand, Sol Mate, produces 10-ounce glass bottles available at Canadian and U.S. retailers, making use of the translingual pun (English 'soul mate'; Spanish/Portuguese 'sun mate') for the sake of marketing.\n\nIn some parts of the Southern Cone they prefer to drink bitter mate, especially in Paraguay, Uruguay, the south of Brazil, and parts of Argentina and Bolivia. This is referred to in Brazil and a large part of Argentina as \"cimarrón\"—which also an archaic name for wild cattle, especially, to a horse that was very attached to a cowboy—which is understood as unsweetened mate. Many people are of the opinion that mate should be drunk in this form.\n\nUnlike bitter mate, in every preparation of \"mate dulce\", or sweet mate, sugar is incorporated according to the taste of the drinker. This form of preparation is very widespread in various regions of Argentina, like in the Santiago del Estero province, Córdoba (Argentina), Cuyo, and the metropolitan region of Buenos Aires, among others. In Chile, this form of mate preparation is widespread in mostly rural zones. The spoonful of sugar or honey should fall on the edge of the cavity that the straw forms in the yerba, not all over the mate. One variation is to sweeten only the first mate preparation in order to cut the bitterness of the first sip, thus softening the rest.\n\nIn the sweet version artificial sweeteners are also often added, as much as for health problems like diabetes, as for taste. As an alternative sweetener, natural \"ka’á he’é\" (Stevia rebaudiana) is preferred, which is an herb whose leaves are added in order to give a touch of sweetness. This is used principally in Paraguay. In Peru it is widespread in rural zones, and it is prepared with coca (plant) or in a sweetened tea form with small slices of lemon or orange\"\n\nThe gourd in which bitter mate is drunk is not used to consume sweet mate due to the idea that the taste of the sugar would be detrimental to its later use to prepare and drink bitter mate, as it is said that it ruins the flavor of the mate.\n\n"}

The vertebrae are boiled at high temperatures to soften the meat. To remove the meat, one must use an instrument such as a chopstick. The meal is usually served with kimchi and a bowl of rice.

The main industry of Jeolla Province was agriculture, and hogs were widely raised and used for food. The origins of gamjatang can be traced back to the Three Kingdoms era when South Jeolla farmers raised hogs in greater numbers than in most of the rest of Korea.\n\nSince cattle were the backbone of farming then, used both for their milk and plowing, cattle were much more valuable than hogs. Slaughtering hogs for feasts and special occasions was much more common than slaughtering beef, which helps explain the dish's pork origins.\n\nWhen Incheon harbor opened, many people migrated to Seoul and its surrounding area from Jeolla Province, as well as from other parts of the country. When construction of the Gyung-ui Railway began in 1899, laborers started working around Incheon, and gamjatang become popular among them because it is cheap and nutritious, and its high fat content provided the calories they needed. As time passed, gamjatang became one of the iconic foods of Incheon. \n\n\n"}

It is made from egg yolks, sugar, and flavourings such as honey, vanilla, cocoa or rum, similar to eggnog. In its classic form it is served slightly chilled or at room temperature. Served warm or hot, it is considered a home remedy for sore throats. Variations include milk, honey and soda.\n\nKogel mogel became known by this name by the 17th-century Jewish communities of Central Europe. It may have its roots in the Jewish code of law called the \"Shulchan Arukh\" where one is allowed to consume sweet syrup and/or raw egg on \"Shabbat\" to make one's voice more pleasant.\n\nVasmer's dictionary mentions different hypotheses on the origin of the name such as English \"hug-mug\", \"hugger-mugger\", or German \"Kuddelmuddel\".\n\nThe dessert was made popular during the communist era when sweets were rare. It is still eaten in Poland and in Polish communities around the world.\n\nThe dish consists of raw egg yolks and sugar, beaten and ground until they form a creamy texture, with no discernible grains of sugar. In modern kitchens, it is often mixed in a blender until it changes color and becomes thick. A classic single Gogl-Mogl portion is made from two egg yolks and three teaspoons of sugar beat into a cream-like dish. Variations can be made by adding chocolate, vodka, rum, honey, vanilla, lemon juice, orange juice, raisins, whipped cream, or a number of other ingredients based on one's own taste preferences.\n\nKogel mogel is often prepared as a transition food for babies moving from a cereal diet to one that includes eggs and other soft foods. It is also a folk medicine used for treating colds or flu, particularly chest colds and laryngitis. Kogel mogel is ranked highly among other traditional cold remedies such as chicken soup. The baby transition recipe includes raw eggs and sugar which in spite of its widespread use in Russia, is a health risk, especially to young children, due to possible contraction of \"Salmonella\".\n\nThe traditional usage of Kogel mogel as a home remedy for treating a sore throat is supported by research done in Israel. The simplest form of preparation as a remedy is with no egg, but only honey added to warm milk. More commonly, a single raw egg is added to a cup of warm milk and mixed with a tablespoon of honey.\n\nIn the German translation of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", Humpty Dumpty is called \"Goggelmoggel\".\n\nIn the 1985 film of Doctor Aybolit from the Soviet Union, Doctor Aybolit nurses sick pirates and animals back to health by giving them Kogel mogel.\n\nA similar sounding phrase, \"Great Googly Moogly\", an apparent euphemism for \"Great God Almighty,\", appears in a Howlin' Wolf song, \"Goin' Down Slow\", and in the work of Langston Hughes, and was later more generally popularized by Frank Zappa and Mr. Magoo.\n"}

Although the extent of human sacrifice is unknown among several Mesoamerican civilizations, such as Teotihuacán, what distinguished Maya and Aztec human sacrifice was the importance with which it was embedded in everyday life.\n\nIn 1521, Spanish explorers such as Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and made observations of and wrote reports about the practice of human sacrifice. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who participated in the Cortés expedition, made frequent mention of human sacrifice in his memoir \"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\". There are a number of second-hand accounts of human sacrifices written by Spanish friars, that relate to the testimonies of native eyewitnesses. The literary accounts have been supported by archeological research. Since the late 1970s, excavations of the offerings in the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and other archaeological sites, have provided physical evidence of human sacrifice among the Mesoamerican peoples.\n\nA wide variety of interpretations of the Aztec practice of human sacrifice have been proposed by modern scholars. Many scholars now believe that Aztec human sacrifice was performed in honor of the gods. Most scholars of Pre-Columbian civilization see human sacrifice among the Aztecs as a part of the long cultural tradition of human sacrifice in Mesoamerica.\n\nSacrifice was a common theme in the Aztec culture. In the Aztec \"Legend of the Five Suns\", all the gods sacrificed themselves so that mankind could live. Some years after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, a body of Franciscans confronted the remaining Aztec priesthood and demanded, under threat of death, that they desist from this traditional practice. The Aztec priests defended themselves as follows:\n\nWhat the Aztec priests were referring to was a central Mesoamerican belief: that a great, continuing sacrifice of the gods sustains the Universe. A strong sense of indebtedness was connected with this worldview. Indeed, \"nextlahualli\" (debt-payment) was a commonly used metaphor for human sacrifice, and, as Bernardino de Sahagún reported, it was said that the victim was someone who \"gave his service\".\n\nHuman sacrifice was in this sense the highest level of an entire panoply of offerings through which the Aztecs sought to repay their debt to the gods. Both Sahagún and Toribio de Benavente (also called \"Motolinía\") observed that the Aztecs gladly parted with everything. Even the \"stage\" for human sacrifice, the massive temple-pyramids, was an offering mound: crammed with the land's finest art, treasure and victims, then buried underneath for the deities.\n\nAdditionally, the sacrifice of animals was a common practice, for which the Aztecs bred dogs, eagles, jaguars and deer. The cult of Quetzalcoatl required the sacrifice of butterflies and hummingbirds.\n\nSelf-sacrifice was also quite common; people would offer maguey thorns, tainted with their own blood and would offer blood from their tongues, ear lobes, or genitals. Blood held a central place in Mesoamerican cultures. The 16th-century Florentine Codex by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún reports that in one of the creation myths, Quetzalcóatl offered blood extracted from a wound in his own genitals to give life to humanity. There are several other myths in which Nahua gods offer their blood to help humanity.\n\nIt is debated whether these rites functioned as a type of atonement for Aztec believers. Some scholars argue that the role of sacrifice was to assist the gods in maintaining the cosmos, and not as an act of propitiation. Aztec society viewed even the slightest tlatlacolli ('sin' or 'insult') as an extremely malevolent supernatural force. To avoid such calamities befalling their community, those who had erred punished themselves by extreme measures such as slitting their tongues for vices of speech or their ears for vices of listening. Other methods of atoning wrongdoings included hanging themselves, or throwing themselves down precipices.\n\nWhat has been gleaned from all of this is that the sacrificial role entailed a great deal of social expectation and a certain degree of acquiescence.\n\nAccording to Diego Durán's History of the Indies of New Spain, and a few other sources that are also based on the Crónica X, the Flower Wars were an act of ritual between the cities of Aztec Triple Alliance and Tlaxcala, Huexotzingo and Cholula. This form of ritual was motivated by the Mesoamerican cultures in 1450 after a series of droughts and famine caused many deaths within the Mexican highlands. The droughts and damage to the crops were believed to be punishment by the gods for feeling disvalued instead of being honored properly. Therefore, the Flower Wars became a way to obtain human sacrifices in a very structured and ceremonial manner which were then used as offerings.\n\nThis type of warfare differed from regular political warfare, as the Flower war was also used for combat training and as first exposure to war for new military members. In addition, regular warfare included the use of long range weapons such as atlatl darts, stones, and sling shots to damage the enemy from afar. During Flower wars, warriors were expected to fight up close and exhibit their combat abilities while aiming to injure the enemy, rather than kill them. The main objective of Aztec Flower warfare was to capture victims alive for use later as human sacrifice, and offerings to the gods. When death occurred from battling in a Flower War, it was considered much more noble than dying in a regular military battle. Additionally, death in the Flower Wars contained religious importance as those who died were thought to live in heaven with the war god, Huitzilopochtli.\n\nHuman sacrifice rituals were performed during the appropriate times each month with the appropriate number of living bodies, and other goods, to properly appease and honor the gods. These individuals were previously chosen to be sacrificed, as was the case for people embodying the gods themselves, or were members of an enemy party which had been captured and prepared to be sacrificed. Even enemies of the Aztecs understood their roles as sacrifices to the gods since many also practiced the same type of religion. For many rites, the victim had such a quantity of prescribed duties that it is difficult to imagine how the accompanying festival would have progressed without some degree of compliance on the part of the victim. For instance, victims were expected to bless children, greet and cheer passers-by, hear people's petitions to the gods, visit people in their homes, give discourses and lead sacred songs, processions and dances.\n\nA great deal of cosmological thought seems to have underlain each of the Aztec sacrificial rites. Most of the sacrificial rituals took more than two people to perform. In the usual procedure of the ritual, the sacrifice would be taken to the top of the temple. The sacrifice would then be laid on a stone slab, a \"chacmool\", by four priests, and his/her abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest with a ceremonial knife made of flint. The most common form of human sacrifice was heart-extraction. The Aztec believed that the heart (\"tona\") was both the seat of the individual and a fragment of the Sun's heat (\"istli\"). The \"chacmool\" was a very important religious tool used during sacrifices. The cut was made in the abdomen and went through the diaphragm. The priest would grab the heart which would be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honored god, and the body would then be thrown down the temple's stairs. The body would land on a terrace at the base of the pyramid called an \"apetlatl\".\n\nBefore and during the killing, priests and audience, gathered in the plaza below, stabbed, pierced and bled themselves as auto-sacrifice. Hymns, whistles, spectacular costumed dances and percussive music marked different phases of the rite.\n\nThe body parts would then be disposed of, the viscera fed the animals in the zoo, and the bleeding head was placed on display in the \"tzompantli\" or the skull rack. When the consumption of individuals was involved, the warrior who captured the enemy was given the meaty limbs while the most important flesh, the stomach and chest, were offerings to the gods.\n\nOther types of human sacrifice, which paid tribute to various deities, killed the victims differently. The victim could be shot with arrows, die in gladiatorial style fighting, be sacrificed as a result of the Mesoamerican ballgame, burned, flayed after being sacrificed, or drowned.\n\nThose individuals who were unable to complete their ritual duties were disposed of in a much less honorary matter. This \"insult to the gods\" needed to be atoned, therefore the sacrifice was slain while being chastised instead of revered. The conquistadors Cortés and Alvarado found that some of the sacrificial victims they freed \"indignantly rejected [the] offer of release and demanded to be sacrificed\".\n\nSome post-conquest sources report that at the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. This number is considered by Ross Hassig, author of \"Aztec Warfare\", to be an exaggeration. Hassig states \"between 10,000 and 80,400 persons\" were sacrificed in the ceremony. The higher estimate would average 14 sacrifices per minute during the four-day consecration. Four tables were arranged at the top so that the victims could be jettisoned down the sides of the temple. Nonetheless, according to Codex Telleriano-Remensis, old Aztecs who talked with the missionaries told about a much lower figure for the reconsecration of the temple, approximately 4,000 victims in total.\n\nMichael Harner, in his 1977 article \"The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice\", cited an estimate by Borah of the number of persons sacrificed in central Mexico in the 15th century as high as 250,000 per year which may have been one percent of the population. Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl, a Mexica descendant and the author of Codex Ixtlilxochitl, estimated that one in five children of the Mexica subjects was killed annually. Victor Davis Hanson argues that a claim by Don Carlos Zumárraga of 20,000 per annum is \"more plausible\". Other scholars believe that, since the Aztecs often tried to intimidate their enemies, it is more likely that they could have inflated the number as a propaganda tool. The same can be said for Bernal Díaz's inflated calculations when, in a state of visual shock, he grossly miscalculated the number of skulls at one of the seven Tenochtitlan tzompantlis. The counter argument is that both the Aztecs and Diaz were very precise in the recording of the many other details of Aztec life, and inflation or propaganda would be unlikely. According to the Florentine Codex, fifty years before the conquest the Aztecs burnt the skulls of the former tzompantli. Archeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma has unearthed and studied some tzompantlis. In 2003, archaeologist Elizabeth Graham noted that the largest number of skulls yet found at a single tzompantli was only about a dozen.\n\nEvery Aztec warrior would have to provide at least one prisoner for sacrifice. All the male population was trained to be warriors, but only the few who succeeded in providing captives could become full-time members of the warrior elite. Accounts also state that several young warriors could unite to capture a single prisoner, which suggests that capturing prisoners for sacrifice was challenging.\n\nThere is still much debate as to what social groups constituted the usual victims of these sacrifices. It is often assumed that all victims were 'disposable' commoners or foreigners. However, slaves – a major source of victims – were not a permanent class but rather persons from any level of Aztec society who had fallen into debt or committed some crime. Likewise, most of the earliest accounts talk of prisoners of war of diverse social status, and concur that virtually all child sacrifices were locals of noble lineage, offered by their own parents. That women and children were not excluded from potential victims is attested by a tzompantli found in 2015 at Templo Mayor in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan.\n\nIt is doubtful if many victims came from far afield. In 1454, the Aztec government forbade the slaying of captives from distant lands at the capital's temples. Duran's informants told him that sacrifices were consequently 'nearly always ... friends of the [Royal] House' – meaning warriors from allied states.\n\nHuitzilopochtli was the tribal deity of the Mexica and, as such, he represented the character of the Mexican people and was often identified with the sun at the zenith, and with warfare, who burned down towns and carried a fire-breathing serpent, Xiuhcoatl. He was considered the primary god of the south and a manifestation of the sun, and a counterpart of the black Tezcatlipoca, the primary god of the north, \"a domain associated with Mictlan, the underworld of the dead\".\n\nHuitzilopochtli was worshipped at the Templo Mayor, which was the primary religious structure of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. The Templo Mayor consisted of twin pyramids, one for Huitzilopochtli and one for the rain god Tlaloc (discussed below).\n\nWhen the Aztecs sacrificed people to Huitzilopochtli (the god with warlike aspects) the victim would be placed on a sacrificial stone. The priest would then cut through the abdomen with an obsidian or flint blade. The heart would be torn out still beating and held towards the sky in honor to the Sun-God. The body would then be pushed down the pyramid where the Coyolxauhqui stone could be found. The Coyolxauhqui Stone recreates the story of Coyolxauhqui, Huitzilopochtli's sister who was dismembered at the base of a mountain, just as the sacrificial victims were. The body would be carried away and either cremated or given to the warrior responsible for the capture of the victim. He would either cut the body in pieces and send them to important people as an offering, or use the pieces for ritual cannibalism. The warrior would thus ascend one step in the hierarchy of the Aztec social classes, a system that rewarded successful warriors.\n\nDuring the festival of Panquetzaliztli, of which Huitzilopochtli was the patron, sacrificial victims were adorned in the manner of Huitzilopochtli's costume and blue body paint, before their hearts would be sacrificially removed. Representations of Huitzilopochtli called teixiptla were also worshipped, the most significant being the one at the Templo Mayor which was made of dough mixed with sacrificial blood.\n\nTezcatlipoca was generally considered the most powerful god, the god of night, sorcery and destiny (the name \"tezcatlipoca\" means \"smoking mirror\", or \"obsidian\"), and the god of the north. The Aztecs believed that Tezcatlipoca created war to provide food and drink to the gods. Tezcatlipoca was known by several epithets including \"the Enemy\" and \"the Enemy of Both Sides\", which stress his affinity for discord. He was also deemed the enemy of Quetzalcoatl, but an ally of Huitzilopochtli. Tezcatlipoca had the power to forgive sins and to relieve disease, or to release a man from the fate assigned to him by his date of birth; however, nothing in Tezcatlipoca's nature compelled him to do so. He was capricious and often brought about reversals of fortune, such as bringing drought and famine. He turned himself into Mixcoatl, the god of the hunt, to make fire. To the Aztecs, he was an all-knowing, all-seeing nearly all-powerful god. One of his names can be translated as \"He Whose Slaves We Are\".\n\nSome captives were sacrificed to Tezcatlipoca in ritual gladiatorial combat. The victim was tethered in place and given a mock weapon. He died fighting against up to four fully armed jaguar knights and eagle warriors.\n\nDuring the 20-day month of Toxcatl, a young impersonator of Tezcatlipoca would be sacrificed. Throughout a year, this youth would be dressed as Tezcatlipoca and treated as a living incarnation of the god. The youth would represent Tezcatlipoca on earth; he would get four beautiful women as his companions until he was killed. In the meantime he walked through the streets of Tenochtitlan playing a flute. On the day of the sacrifice, a feast would be held in Tezcatlipoca's honor. The young man would climb the pyramid, break his flute and surrender his body to the priests. Sahagún compared it to the Christian Easter.\n\nXiuhtecuhtli is the god of fire and heat and in many cases is considered to be an aspect of Huehueteotl, the \"Old God\" and another fire deity.\n\nBoth Xiuhtecuhtli and Huehueteotl were worshipped during the festival of \"Izcalli.\" For ten days preceding the festival various animals would be captured by the Aztecs, to be thrown in the hearth on the night of celebration.\n\nTo appease Huehueteotl, the fire god and a senior deity, the Aztecs had a ceremony where they prepared a large feast, at the end of which they would burn captives; before they died they would be taken from the fire and their hearts would be cut out. Motolinía and Sahagún reported that the Aztecs believed that if they did not placate Huehueteotl, a plague of fire would strike their city. The sacrifice was considered an offering to the deity.\n\nXiuhtecuhtli was also worshipped during the New Fire Ceremony, which occurred every 52 years, and prevented the ending of the world. During the festival priests would march to the top of the volcano \"Huixachtlan\" and when the constellation \"the fire drill\" (Orion's belt) rose over the mountain, a man would be sacrificed. The victim's heart would be ripped from his body and a ceremonial hearth would be lit in the hole in his chest. This flame would then be used to light all of the ceremonial fires in various temples throughout the city of Tenochtitlan.\n\nTlaloc is the god of rain, water, and earthly fertility. The Aztecs believed that if sacrifices were not supplied for Tlaloc, rain would not come, their crops would not flourish, and leprosy and rheumatism, diseases caused by Tlaloc, would infest the village.\n\nArchaeologists have found the remains of at least 42 children sacrificed to Tlaloc at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. Many of the children suffered from serious injuries before their death, they would have to have been in significant pain as Tlaloc required the tears of the young as part of the sacrifice. The priests made the children cry during their way to immolation: a good omen that Tlaloc would wet the earth in the raining season.\n\nIn the Florentine Codex, also known as \"General History of the Things of New Spain\", Sahagún wrote:\n\nXipe Totec, known as \"Our Lord the Flayed One\", is the god of rebirth, agriculture, the seasons, and craftsmen.\n\nXipe Totec was worshipped extensively during the festival of \"Tlacaxipehualiztli\", in which captured warriors and slaves were sacrificed in the ceremonial center of the city of Tenochtitlan. For forty days prior to their sacrifice one victim would be chosen from each ward of the city to act as \"ixiptla,\" dress and live as Xipe Totec. The victims were then taken to the Xipe Totec's temple where their hearts would be removed, their bodies dismembered, and their body parts divided up to be later eaten. Prior to death and dismemberment the victim's skin would be removed and worn by individuals who traveled throughout the city fighting battles and collecting gifts from the citizens.\n\nThe cycle of fifty-two years was central to Mesoamerican cultures. The Nahua's religious beliefs were based on a great fear that the universe would collapse after each cycle if the gods were not strong enough. Every fifty-two years a special New Fire ceremony was performed. All fires were extinguished and at midnight a human sacrifice was made. The Aztecs then waited for the dawn. If the Sun appeared it meant that the sacrifices for this cycle had been enough. A fire was ignited on the body of a victim, and this new fire was taken to every house, city and town. Rejoicing was general: a new cycle of fifty-two years was beginning, and the end of the world had been postponed, at least for another 52-year cycle.\n\nSacrifices were made on specific days. Sahagún, Juan Bautista de Pomar and Motolinía report that the Aztecs had eighteen festivities each year, one for each Aztec month. The table below shows the festivals of the 18-month year of the Aztec calendar and the deities with which the festivals were associated.\n\nVisual accounts of Aztec sacrificial practice are principally found in codices and some Aztec statuary. Many visual renderings in the codices were created for Spanish patrons, and thus may reflect European preoccupations and prejudices. Produced during the 16th century, the most prominent codices include the Ríos, Tudela, Telleriano-Remensis, Magliabechiano, and Sahagún’s Florentine. A contrast is offered in the few Aztec statues that depict sacrificial victims, which show an Aztec understanding of sacrifice. Rather than showing a preoccupation with debt repayment, they emphasize the mythological narratives that resulted in human sacrifices, and often underscore the political legitimacy of the Aztec state. For instance, the Coyolxauhqui stone found at the foot of the Templo Mayor commemorates the mythic slaying of Huitzilopochli's sister for the matricide of Coatlicue; it also, as Cecelia Kline has pointed out, \"served to warn potential enemies of their certain fate should they try to obstruct the state's military ambitions\".\n\nIn addition to the accounts provided by Sahagún and Durán, there are other important texts to be considered.\n\nJuan de Grijalva, Hernán Cortés, Juan Díaz, Bernal Díaz, Andrés de Tapia, Francisco de Aguilar, Ruy González and the Anonymous Conqueror wrote about the Conquest of Mexico. Martyr d'Anghiera, Lopez de Gomara, Oviedo y Valdes and Illescas, while not in Mesoamerica, wrote their accounts based on interviews with the participants. Bartolomé de Las Casas and Sahagún arrived later to New Spain but had access to direct testimony, especially of the indigenous people.\n\nJuan de Grijalva was one of the first Spaniards to explore Mexico and traveled on his expedition in 1518 with Juan Díaz. Diaz wrote \"Itinerario de Grijalva\" before 1520, in which he describes the aftermath of a sacrifice on an island off the coast of Veracruz. He said,When he reached said tower the Captain asked him why such deeds were committed there and the Indian answered that it was done as a kind of sacrifice and gave to understand that the victims were beheaded on the wide stone; that the blood was poured into the vase and that the heart was taken out of the breast and burnt and offered to the said idol. The fleshy parts of the arms and legs were cut off and eaten. This was done to the enemies with whom they were at war.\n\nBernal Díaz corroborates Juan Díaz's history:\n\nIn \"The Conquest of New Spain\" Díaz recounted that, after landing on the coast, they came across a temple dedicated to Tezcatlipoca. \"That day they had sacrificed two boys, cutting open their chests and offering their blood and hearts to that accursed idol\". Díaz narrates several more sacrificial descriptions on the later Cortés expedition. Arriving at Cholula, they find \"cages of stout wooden bars ... full of men and boys who were being fattened for the sacrifice at which their flesh would be eaten\". When the conquistadors reached Tenochtitlan, Díaz described the sacrifices at the Great Pyramid:\n\nAccording to Bernal Díaz, the chiefs of the surrounding towns, for example Cempoala, would complain on numerous occasions to Cortés about the perennial need to supply the Aztecs with victims for human sacrifice. It is clear from his description of their fear and resentment toward the Mexicas that, in their opinion, it was no honor to surrender their kinsmen to be sacrificed by them.\n\nAt the town of Cingapacigna Cortez told the chiefs that for them to become friends and brothers of the Spaniards they must end the practice of making sacrifices. According to Bernal Diaz: \n\nOn meeting a group of inhabitants from Cempoala who gave Cortes and his men food and invited them to their village:\nCortés was the Spanish conquistador whose expedition to Mexico in 1519 led to the fall of the Aztecs, and led to the conquering of vast sections of Mexico on behalf of the Crown of Castile.\n\nCortés wrote of Aztec sacrifice on numerous occasions, one of which in his \"Letters,\" he states:\n\nThe Anonymous Conquistador was an unknown travel companion of Cortés who wrote \"Narrative of Some Things of New Spain and of the Great City of Temestitan\" which details Aztec sacrifices.\n\nThe Anonymous Conquistador wrote, They lead him to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be sacrificed dances and carries on like the rest. At length the man who offers the sacrifice strips him naked, and leads him at once to the stairway of the tower where is the stone idol. Here they stretch him on his back, tying the hands to the sides and fastening the legs ... Soon comes the sacrificing priest—and this is no small office among them—armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and is as big as one of our large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself. At this point the chief priest of the temple takes it, and anoints the mouth of the principal idol with the blood; then filling his hand with it he flings it towards the sun, or towards some star, if it be night. Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.\n\nModern excavations in Mexico City have found evidence of human sacrifice in the form of hundreds of skulls at the site of old temples.\n\nDifferent anthropological or other sources have attempted to explain a possible ecological explanation of the need for human sacrifices to supplement overall Aztec diet. Harner's main argument lies within his claim that cannibalism is needed to assist the diet of the Aztecs. He claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture, without domesticated herbivores, led to a deficiency of essential amino acids amongst the Aztecs. As population increased and the amount of available game decreased, the Aztecs had to compete with other carnivorous mammals, such as dogs, to find food. Harner believes that although intensified agricultural practices provided the Aztec society a surplus of carbohydrates, they did not provide sufficient nutritional balance; for this reason, the cannibalistic consumption of sacrificed humans was needed to supply an appropriate amount of protein per individual. Harris, author of \"Cannibals and Kings\", has propagated the claim, originally proposed by Harner, that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins.\n\nHowever, Bernard Ortiz Montellano offers a counter argument and points out the faults of Harner's sources. First off, Ortiz challenges Harner's claim of the Aztecs needing to compete with other carnivorous mammals for protein packed food. Many other types of foods were available to the Aztecs, including meat from salamanders, fowls, armadillos, and weasels. These resources were also plenty available due to their need to subsist in Lake Texcoco, the place where the Aztecs had created their home. In addition, even if no herbivores were available to eat, the nutrients needed were found in the leaves and seeds of amaranth which also provided protein. Lastly, the Aztecs had a highly structured system in which \"chinampas\" and tribute provided a surplus of materials and therefore ensured the Aztec were able to meet their caloric needs.\n\nOrtiz's argument helps to frame and evaluate the gaps within Harner's argument. Part of the issue with Harner's reasoning for Aztec use of cannibalism was the lack of reliability of his sources. Harner recognized the numbers he used may be contradicting or conflicting with other sources, yet he continued to use these sources and claimed them as reliable. Ortiz qualifies Harner's sources as Spanish propaganda, and states the need to critique primary sources of interactions with the Aztecs. By dehumanizing and villainizing Aztec culture, the Spaniards were able to justify their own actions for conquest. Therefore, encounters with sacrificial cannibalism were grossly exaggerated and Harner used the sources to aid his argument. Overall, ecological factors alone are not sufficient to account for human sacrifice and, more recently, it is posited that religious beliefs have a significant effect on motivation.\n\nSacrifices were ritualistic and symbolic acts accompanying huge feasts and festivals, and were a way to properly honor the gods. Victims usually died in the \"center stage\" amid the splendor of dancing troupes, percussion orchestras, elaborate costumes and decorations, carpets of flowers, crowds of thousands of commoners, and all the assembled elite. Aztec texts frequently refer to human sacrifice as \"neteotoquiliztli\", \"the desire to be regarded as a god\". These members of the society became an \"ixiptla\"—that is, a god's representative, image or idol.\n\nFor each festival, at least one of the victims took on the paraphernalia, habits, and attributes of the god or goddess whom they were dying to honor or appease. Through this performance, it was said that the divinity had been given 'human form'—that the god now had an \"ixitli\" (face). Duran says such victims were 'worshipped ... as the deity' or 'as though they had been gods'. Even whilst still alive, \"ixiptla\" victims were honored, hallowed and addressed very highly. Particularly the young man who was indoctrinated for a year to submit himself to Tezcatlipoca's temple was the Aztec equivalent of a celebrity, being greatly revered and adored to the point of people \"kissing the ground\" when he passed by.\n\nPosthumously, their remains were treated as actual relics of the gods which explains why victims' skulls, bones and skin were often painted, bleached, stored and displayed, or else used as ritual masks and oracles. For example, Diego Duran's informants told him that whoever wore the skin of the victim who had portrayed god Xipe (Our Lord the Flayed One) felt he was wearing a holy relic. He considered himself 'divine'.\n\nPolitically human sacrifice was important in Aztec culture as a way to represent a social hierarchy between their own culture and the enemies surrounding their city. Additionally, it was a way to structure the society of the Aztec culture itself. The hierarchy of cities like Tenochtitlan were tiered with the \"Tlatoani\" (emperor) on the top, the remaining nobles (\"pipiltin\") next who managed the land owned by the emperor. Then the warriors, the \"pochteca\" (merchants), commoners and farmers. Then the lowest level of the hierarchy consisted of slaves and indentured servants. The only way of achieving social mobility was through successful performance as a warrior. This shows how important capturing enemies for sacrifice was as it was the singular way of achieving some type of \"nobility\".\n\nWithin the system of organization based on hierarchy, there was also a social expectation contributing to the status of an individual at the time of their sacrifice. An individual was punished if unable to confidently address their own sacrifice, i.e. the person acted cowardly beforehand instead of brave. Then, instead of being sacrificed honorably, their lowly death paralleled their new lowly status. Where one's body traveled in the afterlife also depended on the type of death awarded to the individual. Those who died while being sacrificed or while battling in war went to the second-highest heaven, while those who died of illness were the lowest in the hierarchy. Those going through the lowest hierarchy of death were required to undergo numerous torturous trials and journeys, only to culminate in a somber underworld. Additionally, death during Flower Wars was considered much more noble than death during regular military endeavors.\n\n\nIngham, John M. \"Human Sacrifice at Tenochtitln.\" Society for Comparative Studies in Society and History 26 (1984): 379-400.\n"}
{"id": "5376627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5376627", "title": "Kadhi", "text": "Kadhi\n\nKadhi or karhi is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It consists of a thick gravy based on chickpea flour, and contains vegetable fritters called pakoras, to which dahi (yogurt) is added to give it a bit of sour taste. It is often eaten with boiled rice or roti.\n\nIn Northern India, pakoras are added to the gram flour gravy and sour yogurt is added to add flavour to it. They are eaten either with boiled rice or roti. In Rajasthan and Gujarat, it is usually served with khichdi, roti, paratha or rice. It is considered a light food. Rajasthani and Gujarati \"kadhi\" differs from the Uttar Pradesh variety. Traditionally, it is sweeter than the other variants, because sugar or jaggery is added to it, but it can be made without sugar for a more sour taste. It is eaten without pakoras and its consistency is slightly thinner. The Gujarati kadhi is made preferably from buttermilk as it gives a more smooth texture compared to yogurt. Variations on this basic dish includes the addition of certain vegetables, notably \"bhindi\" (okra) in which case it is known as \"bhinda ni kadhi\". In Punjab, kadhi is a simple, quick winter meal. Made from besan (also known as gram flour) to thicken the consistency, and adding pakoras, it is eaten with either long-grain basmati rice or, more commonly, with a roti. Unlike the rest of India, sour yoghurt is not added—just full-fat buttermilk or unsweetened yoghurt.\n\nIn Haryana, a popular variation is called \"haryanvi hara choley kadhi\", made with besan and \"hare choley\" (raw green chickpeas) with pure ghee; the generous semi-melting dollops of homemade fresh butter are added during serving. \"Haryanvi kadhi\" is sometimes cooked with additional ingredients, such as seasonal farm-fresh green bathua leaves or \"kachri\", small wild melons.\n\nIn Southern states, it is seasoned with sauteed asafoetida, mustard seeds, cumin, and fenugreek. The soup is thickened in a different way by addition of pureed split chickpea soaked overnight with whole coriander seeds and dry red chili pepper. Squash, okra, tomato, Chinese spinach, carrots, sweet peas are a few vegetables that are added to seasoning before bringing the soup to a boil. Pakoras (gram flour fritters) are added for special occasions like ceremonies. It is called \"majjige huli\" in Kannada, \"majjiga pulusu\" in Telugu and \"mor kuzhambu\" in Tamil with a similar meaning.

The term is used in Tagalog and Kinaray-a. It also called \"bangkaw\", \"sumbling\" or \"palupad\" in the islands of Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nSibat are typically made with rattan, bamboo, bahi or other hardwood, either with a sharpened tip or a head made from metal. These heads may either be single-edged, double-edged or barbed. Styles vary according to function and origin. For example, a sibat designed for fishing may not be the same as those used for hunting wild game such as boar.\n\nAccording to Kalis Ilustrisimo archivist Romeo Macapagal, in Kapampangan, it is known as \"tandos\" or \"tandus\" and a fishing harpoon with 3 or more prongs is a \"salapang\" in both Tagalog and Kapampangan.\n\nAccording to Filipino martial arts researcher & author Celestino Macachor, a shorter version of the Visayan \"bangkaw\" in Cebu is the \"sapang\", around in length and a thrusting weapon, and a \"budiak\" or \"bodjak\" is a Moro weapon that is about the same length as the \"bangkaw\", but heavier.\n\nIn the Mountain Province of Luzon, the Igorot people have different versions of them such as the \"fan′-kao\" and \"kay-yan′\", and the \"fal-fĕg′\" war spear of the Bontoc people.\n\nThe sibat/bangkaw is widely used in Arnis systems such as San Miguel Eskrima, Modern Arnis, Kombatan, Inayan Eskrima and Pekiti-Tirsia Kali.\n\nSibat can either be used hand-to-hand or thrown from a distance. Blunt portions of the weapon could be used to incapacitate at closer ranges. These attacks can be used in conjunction; the shaft can be used to block an enemy's weapon and then followed with a thrust into the throat or stomach.\n\nIn the Ilocano fighting arts of Kabaroan learned by Grandmaster Ramiro Estalilla, 2 spears () can be used at the same time, with the second spear held with a grip in the middle and used as a shield. When one spear is thrown, the practitioner can then draw his blade and dual wield with a blade and spear.\n\nThe Igorot and Aeta people in Luzon also have a spears with a detachable heads. The Aeta remove the heads when entering Christian towns to trade (during which the shaft can still be used as a staff weapon) and in the Igorot spear's case, the detachable head can be used as a dagger.\n\nTraditionally, Philippine spears were not used with the \"helicopter\" twirling motions found in Chinese arts such as Wushu and Indian Silambam. According to FMA instructor and journalist Daniel Foronda who hails from the Mountain Province region, such twirling techniques cannot be used amongst dense pine trees, and basic utilization with the Igorot spear is more akin to rifle bayonet training.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5380129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5380129", "title": "Derveni papyrus", "text": "Derveni papyrus\n\nThe Derveni papyrus is an ancient Macedonian papyrus roll that was found in 1962. It is a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher Anaxagoras. It was composed near the end of the 5th century BC, and \"in the fields of Greek religion, the sophistic movement, early philosophy, and the origins of literary criticism it is unquestionably the most important textual discovery of the 20th century.\" The roll itself dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of Philip II of Macedon, making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript. While interim editions and translations were published over the subsequent years, the manuscript as a whole was finally published in 2006.\n\nThe roll was found on 15 January 1962 at a site in Derveni, Macedonia, northern Greece, on the road from Thessaloniki to Kavala. The site is a nobleman's grave in a necropolis that was part of a rich cemetery belonging to the ancient city of Lete. It is the oldest surviving manuscript in the Western tradition and one of the very few surviving papyri, and probably the oldest literary papyrus, found in Greece. The archaeologists Petros Themelis and Maria Siganidou recovered the top parts of the charred papyrus scroll and fragments from ashes atop the slabs of the tomb; the bottom parts had burned away in the funeral pyre. The scroll was carefully unrolled and the fragments joined together, thus forming 26 columns of text. It survived in the humid Greek soil, which is unfavorable to the conservation of papyri, because it was carbonized (hence dried) in the nobleman’s funeral pyre. However, this has made it extremely difficult to read, since the ink is black and the background is black too; in addition, it survives in the form of 266 fragments, which are conserved under glass in descending order of size, and has had to be painstakingly reconstructed. Many smaller fragments are still not placed. The papyrus is kept in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.\n\nThe main part of the text is a commentary on a hexameter poem ascribed to Orpheus, which was used in the mystery cult of Dionysus by the 'Orphic initiators'. Fragments of the poem are quoted, followed by interpretations by the main author of the text, who tries to show that the poem does not mean what it literally says. The poem begins with the words \"Close the doors, you uninitiated\", a famous admonition to secrecy, also quoted by Plato. The interpreter claims that this shows that Orpheus wrote his poem as an allegory. The theogony described in the poem has Nyx (Night) give birth to Heaven (Uranus), who becomes the first king. Cronus follows and takes the kingship from Uranus, but he is likewise succeeded by Zeus, whose power over the whole universe is celebrated. Zeus gains his power by hearing oracles from the sanctuary of Night, who tells him \"all the oracles which afterwards he was to put into effect.\" At the end of the text Zeus rapes his mother Rhea, which, in the Orphic theogony, will lead to the birth of Demeter. Zeus would then have raped Demeter, who would then have given birth of Persephone, who then married Dionysus. However, this part of the story must have continued in a second roll which is now lost.\n\nThe interpreter of the poem argues that Orpheus did not intend any of these stories in a literal sense, but they are allegorical in nature.\nThe first surviving columns of the text are less well preserved, but talk about occult ritual practices, including sacrifices to the Erinyes (Furies), how to remove daimones that become a problem, and the beliefs of the magi. They include a quotation of the philosopher Heraclitus. Their reconstruction is extremely controversial, since even the order of fragments is disputed. Two different reconstructions have recently been offered, that by Valeria Piano and that by Richard Janko, who says that he has found that these columns also include a quotation of the philosopher Parmenides.\n\nThe text was not officially published for forty-four years after its discovery (though three partial editions were published). A team of experts was assembled in autumn 2005 led by A. L. Pierris of the Institute for Philosophical studies and Dirk Obbink, director of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri project at the University of Oxford, with the help of modern multispectral imaging techniques by Roger Macfarlane and Gene Ware of Brigham Young University to attempt a better approach to the edition of a difficult text. However, nothing appears to have been published as a result of that initiative, and the photographs are not available to scholars or the Museum. Meanwhile, the papyrus was finally published by a team of scholars from Thessaloniki (Tsantsanoglou et al., below), which provides a complete text of the papyrus based on autopsy of the fragments, with photographs and translation. More work clearly remained to be done (see Janko 2006, below). Subsequent progress has been made in reading the papyrus by Valeria Piano and Richard Janko, who has developed a new method for taking digital microphotographs of the papyrus, which permits some of its most difficult passages to be read for the first time. Examples of these images are now published. A version of Janko's new text is available in the recent edition by Mirjam Kotwick, and a new edition in English is in preparation. A complete digital edition of the papyrus using the new technique is a major \"desideratum\".\n\nThe text of the papyrus contains a mix of dialects. It is mainly a mixture of Attic and Ionic Greek; however it contains a few Doric forms. Sometimes the same word appears in different dialectal forms e.g. cμικρό-, μικρό; ὄντα, ἐόντα; νιν for μιν etc.\n\nOn 12 December 2015, the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki held the official event to celebrate the registration of the Derveni Papyrus in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\nAccording to UNESCO \n\n\"The Derveni Papyrus is of immense importance not only for the study of Greek religion and philosophy, which is the basis for the western philosophical thought, but also because it serves as a proof of the early dating of the Orphic poems offering a distinctive version of Presocratic philosophers. The text of the Papyrus, which is the first book of western tradition, has a global significance, since it reflects universal human values: the need to explain the world, the desire to belong to a human society with known rules and the agony to confront the end of life.\"\n\n\n"}

It is a sweet, egg-enriched bread, which is rooted in the cuisines of Western and Central Asia. Such rich brioche-like breads are also traditional in many other countries, such as Hungary and the Czech Republic. Examples of similar breads from other cultures include \"badnji kruh\" in Croatian cuisine, \"folar de páscoa\" in Portuguese cuisine, \"brioche\" in French cuisine, \"kulich\" in Russian cuisine, \"panettone\" in Italian cuisine, and \"challah\" in Jewish cuisine.\n\n\"Cozonac\" is a sweet bread, into which milk, yeast, eggs, sugar, butter, and other ingredients are mixed together and allowed to rise before baking. In Bulgaria, the \"kozunak\" is prepared by adding lemon zest to the dough mixture, just as the Romanian version. The Italian \"Panettone\" is very similar to the basic \"cozonac\", the most visible difference being their shapes.\n\nIn Romania, the recipes for trimmings differ rather significantly between regions. The dough is essentially similar throughout the country; a plain sweet bread made from flour, eggs, milk, butter, sugar and salt. Depending on the region, one may add to it any of the following: raisins, \"lokum\", grated orange or lemon zest, walnuts or hazelnuts, and vanilla or rum flavor. Cozonac may be sprinkled with poppy seeds on top. Other styles dictate the use of a filling, usually a ground walnut mixture with ground poppy seeds, cocoa powder, rum essence, or raisins. The dough is rolled flat with a pin, the filling is spread and the whole is rolled back into a shape vaguely resembling a pinwheel. In the baked product, the filling forms a swirl adding to the character of the bread.\n\nIt was the sweet chosen to represent Romania in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.\n\nIt is possible that the first \"cozonac\" has been made in Ancient Egypt. Perhaps it was sweetened with honey and filled with seeds. The Greeks took from the Egyptians their interest in cuisine, the yeast, and the leavened doughs. Certainly the Greeks have eaten \"cozonac\". They made it with honey, raisins and walnuts. The Greek \"cozonac\" is called \"plakoús\" (πλακούς). Yeast and implicitly leavened breads, such as \"cozonac\", were \"stolen\" from the Greeks by the Romans, where they added dried fruits to the \"cozonac\". At first there were only two varieties called \"libum\" and \"placenta\". \"Libum\" was a small cake, used as an offering to the gods. Later appeared versions were also consumed by people, not only by the gods. \"Placenta\", more elaborate, is a \"cozonac\" made from cheese, raisins and peanuts, which was served with a sweet wine. Although, they took the ready-made yeast from the Greeks and the Egyptians, the Romans were the ones who discovered all the possibilities offered by the yeast added to doughs, thus becoming true masters of pastry. In the Middle Ages, European bakers often made \"cozonac\" with dried fruits, because they lasted longer.\n\nIn Great Britain, the first recipe of \"cozonac\" appears in a cookbook in 1718, with the recommendation to be baked in long and narrow forms, a recommendation that remains valid nowadays. The French people, those who in the 19th century added the third kind of meal, the dessert, are those who put forward the \"cozonac\", more than others.\n\nToday, this dessert with a long history is prepared mainly in the southeastern European countries, especially in Romania, Moldova and Bulgaria, where it is considered a traditional food.\n\n\n"}

However the culture and function of the konditorei may vary based on locations. In Germany, Austria, and Switzerland it's a popular custom to go to a konditorei to have a cake and some coffee or hot chocolate mid-afternoon. A similar culture is present in several northern European countries influenced by central European trends, such as Denmark and Sweden (however these are called konditori or café/kafé). In order to become a konditor, the speciality baker for a konditorei, the profession (in many countries) requires an extensive apprenticeship or speciality training program.\n\nThe primary focus of a konditorei is selling pastries, which may be made in-house or brought in from another bakery. They commonly also offer a selection of coffees, soft drinks, and many may also sell alcoholic drinks. Many larger konditorei also serve ice cream and chocolates. \n\nApart from its typical menu, a konditorei chiefly differs from a restaurant in that opening hours tend to be morning and afternoon, rather than afternoon and evening. \n\nA konditorei puts emphasis on the artistic aspect of the trade and, unlike a bakery, does not produce breads. The craft developed when particular bakers specialised in the creation of sweet bread to which candied fruits and other sweet ingredients were added. The origin of the word konditor (the konditorei’s baker) stems from the Latin word \"candire\", which stands for “candying of fruits”. Another derivation is the Latin word \"conditura\" (condio) = to concoct (food), preservation (of fruits).\n\nKonditorei is the German word for a pâtisserie or confectionery shop. In Sweden, Norway and Denmark, the word is spelt konditori and the term konditor for a confectioner has been used since the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe profession of the Konditor developed from that of the baker. Once the bakers of medieval times (15th century) mastered the art of baking bread, some started to rarefy the dough with honey, dried fruits and spices. These specialists called themselves Lebküchler, Lebküchner or Lebzelter. They founded a guild in 1643 in the area in and around Nürnberg, Germany. At the same time, the Lebkuchen bakers ran a second trade using wax, a side product of honey: they became chandlers, supplying churches and private households with artistic candles, wax figures and pictures made of wax. They carved wooden molds themselves and used these to pour magnificent pictures made of wax. A few Konditoreien practiced the sophisticated art of the chandlers until recent times. The Lebküchner were turned to confectioners later and finally became Konditoreien.\n\nThe maritime trade brought spices and sugar from the Eastern world to the famous Italian harbor towns of Genoa and Venice. Although sugar had an immense appeal, only the rich were privileged to consume it. The profession of confectioner was related to that of the pharmacist because the trade with sugar was exclusive to pharmacists. The German word “Konfekt” (English: confection) to describe sweets stems from the language of the drug makers, which were also called confectionari.\n\nIn the 14th century, the Venetians introduced marzipan, a confection made from almonds, sugar and rose water, to central Europe. Marzipan was an ideal material for moulding magnificent pictures from, which were artistically painted with plant colouring and often decorated with gold leaf.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, chocolate first made its way to Germany, after the ladies of the upper classes in Spain, Italy and France had long been used to a daily cup of hot chocolate. When the Dutchman Coenraad Johannes van Houten managed to press out the cocoa mass, the additional ingredients cocoa butter and cocoa powder were created. The chocolate thinned with cocoa butter was used to pour a variety of figures, and painting cakes with cocoa powder became popular. The trade of the “Chocolatier”, a Konditor specialised in working with chocolate, was born. Chocolate now played a major role in the Konditorei. A good example is the chocolate cake created by Franz Sacher, who was the chocolate cook for Klemens von Metternich in Vienna in 1832.\n\nThe abundance of sugar through the native sugar beet in the 19th century lead to the development of cakes and pastries, with focus taken off decorative art. Light sponge cakes, almond pastries, apple strudel or milk-cream strudel, Gugelhupf, and cream cakes were served with then modern drinks such as coffee, tea and chocolate.\n\n\n"}

The drink gained notoriety after taking its name from Semtex, a well-known plastic explosive, which is also of Czechoslovak origin.\n\nSemtex was introduced in 1995 by the Pinelli company, which had been formed in 1993 in the town of Čáslav, and which also produced juices and fruit drinks. Over the following decade, Red Bull became the market leader in both the Czech Republic and neighbour Slovakia, with Semtex the second strongest seller, providing Pinelli with most of its sales. Semtex was also exported to Hungary, Austria, Germany and Russia. On 22 April 2011, Pinelli was taken over by the Kofola Group, the largest soft drinks producer in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 2005, Russia's consumer protection agency refused to extend Semtex's production licence due to fears that it could be harmful to consumers' health. New regulations were introduced in Russia limiting stimulants in energy drinks to two for non-alcoholic drinks, and Semtex contains several such additives. Furthermore, it was claimed that Semtex products did not display adequate warnings about excessive consumption.\n\nThe drink is named after Semtex – a popular plastic explosive also invented and produced in the Czech Republic by Explosia a.s., a subsidiary of Synthesia. According to Pinelli's director Květoslav Srovnal, the name inspired \"a feeling of activity and motion\". In late 1994, Pinelli applied for a trademark to gain exclusive use of the Semtex name for food and drinks, after which Synthesia applied for a universal trademark for the name with regard to all products – prior to this the company only owned the Semtex trademark for the explosives sector. Synthesia subsequently sued Pinelli for copyright infringement, and a company spokesman claimed that it was \"unfair competition\", and that an important reason for Pinelli's success was due to the use of the Semtex name. Pinelli had offered to donate a percentage of the drink's profits to a charity of Synthesia's choice, but Synthesia ultimately refused before filing the lawsuit. Srovnal dismissed the refusal of the offer as a \"typical socialist management tactic\".\n\nIn 2002, the two companies decided to settle financially and Pinelli were issued with a licence to use the Semtex name on their drinks products. After splitting from Synthesia, Explosia later threatened to sue Madonna for the use of the Semtex name in her film production company Semtex Girls, but later relented.\n\nTwo basic versions of Semtex drink are available: original Semtex and the sugar-free Semtex Light with artificial sweeteners. Other variants including Semtex Junior, a children's version which lacked stimulants, Semtex Hot (with chilli and ginger) and Semtex Ice (with mint) are no longer available. Until 2012, a stronger version called Semtex Forte was available before being replaced by the similar Semtex Crazy. Semtex Cool, which is green in colour, was also introduced at this time.\n\nTwo sizes of original Semtex are produced – 250 ml and 500 ml. Semtex Light (like the discontinued Semtex Forte) is only available in 250 ml cans, which are 132 mm long and 52 mm in diameter.\n\nSemtex contains the maximum allowed amounts of caffeine and taurine, while the Semtex Forte version contains a higher concentration of glucuronolactone. \n\n"}

The dish has also been further developed to more closely align with the local tastes. \"Bakmi\" is between Chinese style wheat noodles and Japanese udons in thickness, and there are several variants of \"bakmi\" in Indonesia. Although the name \"bakmi\" literally translate to \"pork noodle\", different types of meat might be used, including chicken and beef. Variation includes \"mie ayam\" (chicken noodle) and \"mie goreng\" (stir fried noodle in sweet soy sauce).\n\nChinese influences is evident in Indonesian food, such as \"bakmi\", \"mie ayam\", \"pangsit\", \"mie goreng\", and \"kwetiau goreng\". The dish is derived from Chinese cooking tradition. \"Bakmi/bami\" strongly resembles the Chinese noodles called \"lamian\" and \"mee pok\".\nWhile Bakmi noodles are made from wheat (and in cooked form are also used as Spaghetti), the Chow Mi or Chow Mein noodles are made from rice flour. It is said that Marco Polo introduced the Bakmi noodles in Italy which became Spaghetti.\nIn Thailand, wheat noodles are also known as bami (). It is eaten mainly in noodle soups and in Chinese style stir-fried noodle dishes.\n\nThe words \"mie\" and \"bami\", used in Dutch, come from bakmi and were introduced into the Dutch language during the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia.

The most common type of \"bakmi\" in Indonesia is \"mi kuning\", or 'yellow noodles' made from finely ground wheat, sometimes enriched with eggs as \"mi telur\" (egg noodle) made into dough, ground and run through holes to create noodle strings. The traditional way to create \"bakmi\" is by pulling the dough several times coated with flour to create the noodle strings, similar to the method to make \"lamian\".\n\nThe most common recipe of \"bakmi\" dish in Indonesia uses chicken meat as the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Chicken noodle (), \"mie ayam\" is wheat noodle topped with diced chicken meat seasoned in soy sauce. Mie ayam often accompanied with wonton () either crispy fried or in soup, and also \"bakso\" (meatball). \"Bakmi ayam\" is a popular Chinese Indonesian dish and ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, it can be served in a restaurant to a humble travelling cart. The other popular Indonesian bakmi recipe is fried bakmi ().\n\nBakmi is normally boiled for serving. When bakmi is intended for use in soup, it is usually boiled separately from the broth. The noodles are usually mixed with either pork fat, chicken fat or beef fat. They are then served with toppings that vary from the most common, diced seasoned chicken with choy sum and fried wonton skin, to more expensive type using fried or boiled wonton and \"bakso\" (meatballs). The soup is served in a different bowl, and is added to the noodles by the individual diner according to taste.\n\nSome boiled bakmi are also served with thick gravy instead of a soup, or stir fried. The stir fried process follows after boiling the bakmi, it is stir-fried with vegetables, sweet soy sauce, meat, eggs or any other ingredients such as curry powder or gravy.

The word is probably derived from the German word ' (\"hair parting\") or ' (\"skull\"). The related term in Hebrew is \"pei'ah\" ().

More modern designed lace-front wigs with realistic hairlines or real hair is growing in popularity.\n\nThe \"Shulchan Aruch\", the 16th-century compilation of Jewish law, cites the opinion of Rabbi Joshua Boaz ben Simon Baruch (d. 1557), who permitted the wearing of wigs.\n\nIn 2004, there was a degree of controversy over natural hair sheitels procured from India. It was discovered that the hair used for the production of these wigs was taken from a Hindu temple. According to Halacha, one cannot derive benefit from anything used in what Judaism considers to be idolatry. The controversy ceased when it became clear that the hair was neither worshiped nor offered as a sacrifice to the deity, but shaven as a rite of purification, thus excluding it from the category of forbidden items.\n\nToday, many wigs used by Jewish women come with kosher certification, indicating that they are not made with hair originating from rituals deemed to be idolatrous.\n\nIn many Hasidic groups, sheitels are avoided, as they can give the impression that the wearer's head is uncovered. In other Hasidic groups, women wear some type of covering over the sheitel to avoid this misconception, for example a scarf or a hat. Married Sephardi and National Religious women do not wear wigs, because their rabbis believe that wigs are insufficiently modest, and that other head coverings, such as a scarf (\"tichel\"), a snood, or a hat, are more suitable.

It appears in the Qur'an.\n\n\"Sukainah\" is the Spirit of Tranquility, or Peace of Reassurance. It is a derivative of the original word \"Sakinah\" which is mentioned in the Qur'an as having descended upon the Islamic \"Nabi\" (, Prophet) Muhammad and the believers as they made an unarmed pilgrimage to Mecca, and were faced with an opposing military force of the Quraysh, with whom Muhammad struck the Treaty of Hudaybiyah. \"He it is Who sent down the \"sakinah\" into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith unto their faith\" (48:4).\n\nAnother Qur'anic association with the concord of dwellings in peace coincides with the attribution of the \"Shekhinah\" to matrimonial concord under the tent of Sarah: \"And God gave you your houses as a quiescent place (, \"sakanan\") (16:80).\n\n\"Sakinah\" is further mentioned in the following verse: \"While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,- Allah sent down \"Sakīnaṫahu\" (, His Tranquility) to his Messenger and to the Believers, and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things\" (48:26).\n\nKaren Armstrong notes: \"The sakinah it will also be recalled, seems to be related to the Hebrew Shekhinah (), the term for God's presence in the world.\" \n\nAnother Qur'anic verse portrays \"sakinah\" as reassurance:\n\"Allah's Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Sakina - tranquillity (alssakeenata) to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory\" (48:18).\n\nThe root of the word is \"sa-ka-nah\" which means \"dwelled\" or \"remained in place\". This further supports the association with the Shekhinah as \"indwelling\". The fact that the word is preceded by \"al\" (the) shows that it does not denote a name, but has an abstract meaning.\n\nSufi writings, in expounding the inner peace of Sufi contemplation, which dwells in a sanctuary or in the heart, confirm the association with both Sakinah and the Shekhinah. Sufi reference to \"sa-ka-na\" as meaning both stillness and habitation adds to the identity with Shekhinah's indwelling nature.\n"}

They can be made from almost any fruit, though sour and bitter fruits are especially prized. There are also spoon sweets produced without fruit.\n\nSome of the fruits that are used include seedless grapes, mulberries and other berries, bergamot, apricots, apples, pears, sour and sweet cherries, oranges and kumquats, lemons, grapefruit, tangerines, pomegranates, quinces, figs, prunes, etc. Even soft fruit like melon or watermelon can be thus prepared, although retaining a relatively firm texture is challenging. Other varieties include green, unripe walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and other nuts, or even flower petals like rose. Many fruits or parts of fruits that are normally inedible, such as the various citrus peels and blossoms, or sliced citrus fruits with their peel intact, can be made into sweet, flavorful preserves, as can some vegetables such as baby eggplants or cherry tomatoes. A well-made spoon sweet retains the original shape, color, aroma and taste of the fruit.\n\nSpoon sweets are usually offered to guests served by the teaspoon in a small porcelain or crystal glass dish or bowl, with coffee or tea and cold water. Most of the time they are homemade, but nowadays they can also be easily found in most supermarkets; these are more likely to be made with glucose syrup rather than sugar, for reasons of cost and ease of preparation.\n\nThey can be used as ice cream or yogurt topping, or in the Western way as a spread on toast for breakfast. Spoon sweets are commonly eaten alone or with cheese.\n\nSpoon sweets (γλυκό του κουταλιού \"glykó tou koutalioú\" 'sweet of the spoon') are popular in Greece and Cyprus, usually served with Greek coffee and a glass of cold water. Most are made of whole fruit, though some kinds are made of pieces or purees.\n\nOne typically Greek spoon sweet is the snow-white and intensely aromatic \"vaníllia\" (βανίλια, [va'nilja]) which is \"not\" made of vanilla, but of mastic resin, for which the Aegean island of Chios is famous. This is usually served as a spoonful of sweet on a table spoon dropped into a tall glass of ice-cold water and popularly called \"βανίλια υποβρύχιο\", a \"vanilla submarine\". It is a thick, white, sweet paste made industrially by beating mastic resin with table sugar. When cold, it has the consistency of hard caramel candy: it is meant to be licked like a lollipop as, at body temperature, it gradually becomes softer and more chewable. The Greek diaspora introduced this treat to other countries as far away as Japan. \n\nIt is regarded as the official sweet of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nWhole fruit preserves can be found in most Greek and Cypriot homes. They are made by slowly and gently boiling fruit in water and sugar over several hours or days, until the syrup sets. Thus the main prerequisites to making good spoon sweets are said to be \"patience and a heavy pot\". Some lemon juice is often added to preserve the fruit's original color, as the citric acid prevents oxidation. A small quantity of blanched almonds, slivered or whole, may also be added for crunch, often to baby eggplants, apples or grapes. Ingredients variously added during the boiling, and then discarded, include a quill of cinnamon bark, a mint bouquet, or the green, fragrant leaves of the shrub \"Pelargonium odoratissimum\" (apple geranium) or \"Pelargonium graveolens\" (rose geranium) which add some astringency and a slight aroma of frankincense and is especially popular in the Ionian islands.\n\nThe overall method of preparation is essentially the same as that of marmalade, except that fruit pieces remain firm and whole; a well-made spoon sweet is chewy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5477313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5477313", "title": "Cheese roll", "text": "Cheese roll\n\nA cheese roll (occasionally known by the older name of \"Cheese roll-up\") is a snack food similar to Welsh rarebit, but created by covering a slice of bread in a prepared filling consisting mainly of grated or sliced cheese, and then rolling it into a tube shape before toasting. Cheese rolls are a very popular food in Otago and Southland of New Zealand, where they are commonly found as a menu item at cafeterias and similar food outlets, and uncommonly referred to as southern sushi. They are one of only a very small number of recipes which are specific to only one of New Zealand's two main islands.\n\nThe dish is very simple to prepare, involving at minimum a slice of bread and cheese. More often, added ingredients are placed into a filling mixture, which is prepared earlier. These ingredients typically include onion, Worcestershire sauce,and onion soup mix though other fillings, such as crushed pineapple or sweet corn are also known. An important factor in the preparation of cheese rolls is that this filling mixture is prepared separately before being added to the bread, rather than the filling simply being a slice of cheese covered with any other ingredients.\n\nThe bread is kept in a rolled shape either by breaking the crust so that the slice does not spring back into a flattened shape or by skewering the bread with toothpicks. The outer side of the roll is occasionally coated thinly in butter before toasting to add to the flavour and give the toasted roll a more golden appearance. The resulting roll has the advantages over simple cheese on toast of allowing for a more contrasting combination of a crisp outer surface with a soft interior (often with the cheese in a semi-liquid state), and its shape makes for easier eating.\n\nFood researchers, notably Professor Helen Leach of the University of Otago, have identified three basic traditional styles of filling, with all known recipes seemingly a variant of these three. The first of these recipes developed as a spread in the 1920s, prior to the invention of cheese rolls, using a specific spicy Australia cheese, Rex Cheese. Variants on this style of filling include the use of spicy or strong cheese with mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and even liqueurs such as Kahlúa. A second basic recipe again used spicy cheese, but this time mixed with savoury ingredients such as onion, which was cooked in butter or milk, mixed with the cheese, then thickened with flour or cornflour. A third version is similar to the second, but uses pre-processed food items as major ingredients, most notably dried onion soup mix and evaporated milk.\n\nEarly recipes for the dish date from the 1930s, with the earliest being in New Zealand newspaper \"New Zealand Truth\" from 1935. Though known from this period, the popularity of the delicacy seems to have taken off with the widespread availability of sliced bread from the 1950s. Early recipes referred to the dish under the seemingly disparaging name of \"Rat traps\", a play on the longstanding nickname of \"Mouse traps\" used for cheese on toast, but also likely a reference to the cylindrical shape, which was similar to commercial rodent traps of the era. The earliest known cookbook recipe for cheese rolls dates from Dunedin's Roslyn Church \"Jubilee Cookery Book\" in 1951, with numerous other South Island community cookbooks listing the recipe in the decade that followed. Cheese rolls were not found in any North Island cookbooks, however, until the late 1970s, and the food is still little known north of Waitaki River.\n\nOccasionally \"Cheese roll fundraisers\" are held, especially by schools and sports groups, in much the same way that \"sausage sizzles\" or barbecues can be. Recent rises in the cost of dairy products have however made these fundraisers less profitable than they once were.\n\n"}

The recipe has existed since the 19th century and its origins lie with the indigenous Guaraní people.\nIt is inexpensive and often sold from streetside stands and on buses by vendors carrying a large basket with the warm chipa wrapped in a cloth.\n\nThe original name is from Guarani \"chipa\" (). It is also known as chipa, chipacito or chipita and in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, the term cuñapé (Guarani) is often used.\n\nChipá has been prepared in the Guarani region (Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina, Southeastern Bolivia and Southwestern Brazil) since humans settled in the area. During inception, the Guarani people prepared it only with cassava starch and water. After the arrival of the colonists and Jesuit missionaries, and with the introduction of cattle, chickens and new products derived from this livestock (like cheese and eggs), chipá began to gradually evolve into the widely used recipe of the early 21st century.\n\nIn the Guaraní region, \"chipá\" is often baked in smaller doughnuts or buns that may be called \"chipa'í\" or \"chipacitos\". These are sold in small bags by street sellers of big cities and small towns. In the preparation of chipa yeast is not used, so in spite of the high temperatures of the region it can be preserved for many days. It is a festive food and can be found in every popular religious celebration.\n\nOther common variants in Paraguay include the chipa caburé or chipá mbocá (cooked around a stick, in consequence it doesn't have the spongy inner center) and the chipa so'ó, filled with ground meat. There are other varieties of chipa with different ingredients; chipa manduvi (made with a mix of corn flour and peanut), chipá avatí and chipa rora (made of the skin of the seed of corn after being strained, like a whole-wheat bread).\n\n\n\n"}

Once prepared, the obloid mass is deep-fried. Potato flour is often added to give greater consistency to the dough.

{"id": "5491211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5491211", "title": "Ball (association football)", "text": "Ball (association football)\n\nA football, soccer ball, or association football ball is the ball used in the sport of association football. The name of the ball varies according to whether the sport is called \"football\", \"soccer\", or \"association football\". The ball's spherical shape, as well as its size, weight, and material composition, are specified by Law 2 of the Laws of the Game maintained by the International Football Association Board. Additional, more stringent, standards are specified by FIFA and subordinate governing bodies for the balls used in the competitions they sanction.\n\nEarly footballs began as animal bladders or stomachs that would easily fall apart if kicked too much. Improvements became possible in the 19th century with the introduction of rubber and discoveries of vulcanization by Charles Goodyear. The modern 32-panel ball design was developed in 1962 by Eigil Nielsen, and technological research continues today to develop footballs with improved performance. The 32-panel ball design was soon overcome by 24-panel balls as well as 42-panel balls, both of which improved performance compared to before, in 2007.\n\nA black-and-white patterned truncated icosahedron design, brought to prominence by the Adidas Telstar, has become an icon of the sport. Many different designs of balls exist, varying both in appearance and physical characteristics.\n\nIn the year 1863, the first specifications for footballs were laid down by the Football Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated leather, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their shapes. In 1872 the specifications were revised, and these rules have been left essentially unchanged as defined by the International Football Association Board. Differences in footballs created since this rule came into effect have been to do with the material used in their creation.\n\nFootballs have gone through a dramatic change over time. During medieval times balls were normally made from an outer shell of leather filled with cork shavings. Another method of creating a ball was using animal bladders for the inside of the ball making it inflatable. However, these two styles of creating footballs made it easy for the ball to puncture and were inadequate for kicking. It was not until the 19th century that footballs developed into what a football looks like today.\n\nIn 1838, Charles Goodyear introduced vulcanized rubber, which dramatically improved the football. Vulcanisation is the treatment of rubber to give it certain qualities such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to solvents. Vulcanisation of rubber also helps the football resist moderate heat and cold. Vulcanisation helped create inflatable bladders that pressurize the outer panel arrangement of the football. Charles Goodyear's innovation increased the bounce ability of the ball and made it easier to kick. Most balls of this time had tanned leather with eighteen sections stitched together. These were arranged in six panels of three strips each.\n\nDuring the 1900s, footballs were made out of rubber and leather which was perfect for bouncing and kicking the ball; however, when heading the football (hitting it with the player's head) it was usually painful. This problem was most probably due to water absorption of the leather from rain, which caused a considerable increase in weight, causing head or neck injury. By around 2017, this had also been associated with dementia in former players. Another problem of early footballs was that they deteriorated quickly, as the leather used in manufacturing the footballs varied in thickness and in quality.\n\nElements of the football that today are tested are the deformation of the football when it is kicked or when the ball hits a surface. Two styles of footballs have been tested by the Sports Technology Research Group of Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering in Loughborough University; these two models are called the Basic FE model and the Developed FE model of the football. The basic model considered the ball as being a spherical shell with isotropic material properties. The developed model also utilised isotropic material properties but included an additional stiffer stitching seam region.\n\nCompanies such as Umbro, Mitre, Adidas, Nike, Select and Puma are releasing footballs made out of new materials which are intended to provide more accurate flight and more power to be transferred to the football.\n\nToday's footballs are more complex than past footballs. Most modern footballs consist of twelve regular pentagonal and twenty regular hexagonal panels positioned in a truncated icosahedron spherical geometry. Some premium-grade 32-panel balls use non-regular polygons to give a closer approximation to sphericality. The inside of the football is made up of a latex bladder which enables the football to be pressurised. The ball's panel pairs are stitched along the edge; this procedure can either be performed manually or with a machine.\nThe size of a football is roughly 22 cm (8.65 inches) in diameter for a regulation size 5 ball. Rules state that a size 5 ball must be 68 to 70 cm in circumference. Averaging that to 69 cm and then dividing by gives about 22 cm for a diameter.\n\nThe ball's weight must be in the range of and inflated to a pressure of between at sea level.\n\nThere are a number of different types of football balls depending on the match and turf including training footballs, match footballs, professional match footballs, beach footballs, street footballs, indoor footballs, turf balls, futsal footballs and mini/skills footballs.\n\nMany companies throughout the world produce footballs. The earliest balls were made by local suppliers where the game was played. It is estimated that 55% of all footballs are made in Sialkot, Pakistan, with other major producers being China and India.\n\nAs a response to the problems with the balls in the 1962 FIFA World Cup, Adidas created the Adidas Santiago – this led to Adidas winning the contract to supply the match balls for all official FIFA and UEFA matches, which they have held since the 1970s, and also for the Olympic Games. They also supply the ball for the UEFA Champions League which is called the Adidas Finale.\n\nIn early FIFA World Cups, match balls were mostly provided by the hosts from local suppliers. Records indicate a variety of models being used within individual tournaments and even, on some occasions, individual games. Over time, FIFA took more control over the choice of ball used. Since 1970 Adidas have supplied official match balls for every tournament.\n\nThe following lists the most up-to-date balls used in various club football competitions:\n\nUnicode 5.2 introduces the glyph ⚽ (U+26BD SOCCER BALL), representable in HTML as or .

{"id": "5493064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5493064", "title": "Kalpa (aeon)", "text": "Kalpa (aeon)\n\nKalpa ( \"kalpa\") is a Sanskrit word meaning a relatively long period of time (by human calculation) in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. The concept is first mentioned in the \"Mahabharata\".\n\nIn the Pali language of early Buddhism, the word takes the form \"kappa\", and is mentioned in the assumed oldest scripture of Buddhism, the Sutta Nipata. This speaks of \"Kappâtita: one who has gone beyond time, an Arahant\". This part of the Buddhist manuscripts dates back to the middle part of the last millennium BCE.\n\nGenerally speaking, a kalpa is the period of time between the creation and recreation of a world or universe. The definition of a kalpa equaling 4.32 billion years is found in the \"Puranas\"—specifically \"Vishnu Purana\" and \"Bhagavata Purana\".\n\nAccording to \"Visuddhimagga\", there are several explanations for types of kalpas and their duration. In the first explanation, there are four types:\n\n\nIn another simple explanation, there are four different lengths of kalpas. A regular kalpa is approximately 16 million years long (16,798,000 years), and a \"small\" kalpa is 1000 regular kalpas, or about 16 billion years. Further, a \"medium\" kalpa is roughly 320 billion years, the equivalent of 20 small kalpas. A \"great\" kalpa is 4 medium kalpas, or around 1.28 trillion years.\n\nBuddha did not give the exact length of the \"maha-kalpa\" in terms of years. However, he gave several astounding analogies to understand it.\n\n\nIn one instance, when some monks wanted to know how many kalpas had elapsed so far, Buddha gave the below analogy:\n\n\nAnother definition of Kalpa is the world where Buddhas are born. There are six types of kalpa \n\nThe current kalpa is Bhadda kalpa where Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, Kassapa, and Gautama Buddhas are born and Maitreya Buddha will be born.\n\nIn Hinduism (cf. Hindu Time Cycles), a Kalpa is equal to 4.32 billion years, a \"day of Brahma\" or one thousand \"mahayugas\", measuring the duration of the world. Each kalpa is divided into 14 \"manvantara\" periods, each lasting 71 yuga cycles (306,720,000 years). Preceding the first and following each manvantara period is a juncture (sandhya) equal to the length of a Satya-yuga (1,728,000) years. Two kalpas constitute a day and night of Brahma. A \"month of Brahma\" is supposed to contain thirty such days (including nights), or 259.2 billion years. According to the Mahabharata, 12 months of Brahma (=360 days) constitute his year, and 100 such years the life cycle of the universe. Fifty years of Brahma are supposed to have elapsed, and we are now in the \"shvetavaraha kalpa\" of the fifty-first. At the end of a kalpa, the world is annihilated.\n\nThe previous kalpa was the \"Vyuhakalpa\" (Glorious aeon), the present kalpa is called the \"Bhadrakalpa\" (Auspicious aeon), and the next kalpa will be the \"Nakshatrakalpa\" (Constellation aeon).\n\nThe Matsya Purana (290.3-12) lists the names of 30 kalpas, as follows: \n\nThe Vayu Purana in chapter 21 gives yet another list of 28 kalpas. It also lists five more kalpas in the next chapter.\n\nThe concept of kalpas was an inspiration for the kalpas of the universe of the \"Elder Scrolls\" series of action role-playing open world fantasy video games. In \"The Elder Scrolls\", kalpas represent each life cycle of the mortal realm of Mundus.\n\nIn \"City at the End of Time\", a science fiction novel by Greg Bear, Kalpa is a fortress city built on Earth by descendants of humans in the last period of the Universe to protect themselves from the Chaos that is devouring it.\n\n\n"}

It was one of the top selling chocolates in Australia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, selling over a million units a week.\nAfter a break of nearly a decade, Yowie relaunched in 2014 for US markets.\n\nYowie began as the brainchild of English-born advertising man, illustrator and author Geoff Pike. After serving in the navy, Pike jumped ship in Australia, finding work as a jackaroo on remote cattle stations. He became enchanted by Australia’s outback and its unique wildlife, and devoted his free time to nursing injured and orphaned animals back to health.\n\nMany decades later, after a successful career in advertising, Pike drew on these early bush experiences and his love of wild places to create the Yowie Kingdom, a fictional magical realm free of the destructive influence of humanity, where threatened wildlife finds a safe haven. \n\nInspired by Australian folklore, Pike borrowed the mythical man-like creature the Yowie, reputed to roam the Australian bush. To watch over the fictional Yowie Kingdom and its animals and plants, Pike created six Yowie characters, each related to a well-known Australian animal, and each one guardian of key wild habitats:\n\n\nAdditional characters included animal companions for each of the six Yowie and Balthizar the Bunyip, ruler of the Yowie Kingdom. To represent the threats facing the world’s natural habitats and threatened species, Pike created the Grumkin, careless creatures constantly seeking to destroy the harmony of the Yowie Kingdom. The Grumkins were: Munch (careless building, enemy of Rumble), Blob (pollution, enemy of Crag), Ooz (also pollution, enemy of Squish), Spark (careless firelighting, enemy of Nap), Slob (littering, enemy of Ditty) and Chomp the Tiger Toothed Tree Chomper (deforestation, enemy of Boof).\n\nContinuing with the development of the Yowie concept and characters, Pike enlisted the aid of long-time friend, fellow advertising man and best-selling author Bryce Courtenay. They hit upon the idea of a confectionery product as a vehicle for Yowie, and in 1994 pitched the concept to confectionery giant Cadbury. \n\nAfter three years developing the characters and the manufacturing process, in 1997 Cadbury launched Yowie as a foil-wrapped character-shaped milk chocolate shell containing a plastic capsule. Within the capsule was a multi-part collectable model of a native Australian or New Zealand animal, together with a leaflet featuring information, a photo of the animal and assembly instructions for the collectable. The first series featured 50 animals, plus figurines of each of the six Yowie characters. \n\nCadbury Yowie was selling over one million units weekly and in its first year sold 2.5 Yowies for every man, woman and child in Australia. The brand won multiple industry awards in Australia and internationally, including Best Global Supermarket Product and Best Global Confectionery Product at the 1997 Sial international food industry awards in Paris. \n\nA Yowie collector scene soon emerged with collector clubs forming across Australia and New Zealand and websites devoted to displaying and swapping Yowie collectables.\n\nCadbury Yowie was also released in Singapore, Japan and the UK.\n\nTo coincide with the release of Cadbury Yowie, a series of Yowie books was released, telling the stories of the Yowie characters as they protect their domains from the threat of the Grumkin. Written by Geoff Pike and Bryce Courtenay and illustrated by award-winning artists Christopher Minos and Helen Steele, the series sold more than 2 million copies, topping the Australian best-seller lists for children’s books. \n\nNumerous lines of Yowie merchandise were produced, including soft toys, clothing, games, activity books, and Yowie music CDs.\n\nFollowing the success of the first series of Yowie collectables, a second series was released in 1998, this time featuring 50 new animals.\n\nThe third series of Yowie, released in early 1999, was composed of 50 figurines and 6 limited edition mini Grumkins. This series remained the most common of all the series, extending into 2002, with further scattered releases until the series ended in 2005.\n\nThe fourth series was released in late 1999 and featured ‘Yowie World’ collectables, with animals from beyond Australia and New Zealand, as well as 6 limited edition crystal Yowies, 6 ‘Yowie playmates’ and a Lord Balthizzar figurine. It remained the second-most popular series, extending until 2005.\n\nIn 2000, Yowie teamed up with the Australian Museum to create Yowie and the Lost Kingdoms, the series of collectables featuring extinct animals from around the world and across the geological ages, including dinosaurs and other reptiles as well as extinct Australian megafauna. The Lost Kingdoms series was based on illustrations by Dr Anne Musser of the Australian Museum and masterminded by the director of the museum Dr Michael Archer. The museum presented an exhibition of fossils and reconstructions linking to the series. Additionally, the packaging got overhauled so that the wrappers of the Lost Kingdoms Yowies could be distinguished by the sign and shovel being held in their paws. \n\nSeries A had 50 prehistoric figurines and 6 limited edition skulls. It was later replaced by Series B, released in 2001, which had 30 figurines and 6 limited edition glow-in-the-dark dinosaurs. In 2002 the third and final series, Series C, was released, with 30 figurines and 6 limited edition dazzling dinosaurs.\n\nIn 2001, Yowie Adventures was released, based around comic-strip stories in which the Yowie and their friends save endangered animals from the onslaught of the Grumkin. The series had 30 figurines, and was often regarded as the rarest series,considering supplies seemed limited. It is the most highly sought-after series of all Yowies. The series consisted of 6 animals, 6 enemies, 6 \"yurts\", 6 helpers and 6 transports. The series was updated in 2002 with a second release with 30 figurines, similar to the previous series, except more animals appeared in this series and the Yowie and helpers were replaced with Grumkins and helpers.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, Yowie Forgotten Friends was released. Featuring recently extinct animals, the series highlighted the increasing levels of species extinction and the importance of protecting threatened wildlife and habitats. The Forgotten Friends Series A comprised 30 figurines, with six glow-in-the-dark Yowie. In 2004, Series B of the Forgotten Friends range was released, this time with five limited edition glow-in-the-dark Grumkins. Spark was left out as it was regarded as a bad message to children.\n\nProduction of Cadbury Yowie was discontinued in 2005 following a dispute between Cadbury and the Yowie creators. In 2012 a new company, Yowie Group, was formed to relaunch the brand. A series of 24 solid one-piece collectables, including 18 animals and six Yowie character models, was designed and manufactured. The one-piece format enabled far more lifelike collectables as well as improved product safety.\n\nThe first series features the following animals:\n\n\nProduction of the chocolate and final assembly was taken over by Whetstone Chocolates, based in Florida.\n\nIn July 2014, the first new Yowie products went on sale in the US. \n\nYowie products returned to Australian retail shelves in April 2017.\n\n"}

In early 2002, the parent company Australian Fast Foods purchased Red Rooster from Coles Myer. This was followed by a period of rebranding, changing existing stores outside of Western Australia from Chicken Treat to the more established Red Rooster brand, although there are a few areas where the two co-exist.\n\nIn April 2007, Australian Fast Foods sold Red Rooster and Chicken Treat for $180 million to a consortium formed by the management and the venture capital arm of Westpac known as Quadrant Capital.\n\nIn early 2011, QSR Holdings acquired the Western Australian Chooks brand (formerly known as River Rooster), converting said stores into direct-service outlets with no drive-thru service.

{"id": "5527901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5527901", "title": "Languages of Taiwan", "text": "Languages of Taiwan\n\nThe languages of Taiwan consist of several varieties of languages under families of Austronesian languages and Sino-Tibetan languages spoken in Taiwan. The Formosan languages, a branch of Austronesian languages, have been spoken by the Taiwanese aborigines in Taiwan for thousands of years. Researches on historical linguistics recognize Taiwan as the Urheimat (homeland) of the whole Austronesian languages family owing to the highest internal variety of the Formosan languages. In the last 400 years, several waves of Chinese emigrations brought several different Sino-Tibetan languages into Taiwan. These languages include Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, and Mandarin. These became the major languages of today's Taiwan, and make Taiwan an important center of Hokkien pop and Mandopop.\n\nFormosan languages were the dominant language of the Prehistory of Taiwan. The long colonial and immigration history of Taiwan brought in several languages such as Dutch, Spanish, Hokkien, Hakka, Japanese and Mandarin. Due to its colonial history, Japanese is also spoken and a large amount of loanwords from Japanese exist in several languages of Taiwan.\n\nAfter World War II, a long martial law era was held in Taiwan. Policies of the government in this era suppressed languages other than Mandarin in public use. This has significantly damaged the evolution of local languages including Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, Formosan languages and Matsu dialect. The situation has slightly changed after the 2000s. The government has put some efforts to protect and revitalize local languages. Local languages is now a part of elementary school education in Taiwan. Laws and regulations regarding local language protection were established for Hakka and Formosan languages. Public TV and radio stations exclusively for the two languages were also established. Currently, the government of Taiwan also maintains standards of several widely spoken languages listed below, the percentage of users are from the \"2010 population and household census in Taiwan.\"\n\nThe Taiwanese indigenous languages or Formosan languages are the languages of the aboriginal tribes of Taiwan. Taiwanese aborigines currently comprise about 2.3% of the island's population. However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language, after centuries of language shift. It is common for young and middle-aged Hakka and aboriginal people to speak Mandarin and Hokkien better than, or to the exclusion of, their ethnic languages. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are extinct, another five are moribund, and several others are to some degree endangered. Currently the government recognized 16 languages and 42 accents of the indigenous languages, they are\n\nThe governmental agency — Council of Indigenous Peoples — maintains the orthography of the writing systems of Formosan languages. Due to the era of Taiwan under Japanese rule, a large number of loanwords from Japanese also appear in Formosan languages. There is also Yilan Creole Japanese as a mixture of Japanese and Atayal.\n\nAll Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Mandarin. In recent decades the government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan mother tongue education in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing. Television station — Taiwan Indigenous Television, and radio station — \"Alian 96.3\" were created as an efforts to revive the indigenous languages. Formosan languages were made an official language in July 2017.\n\nThe Amis language is the most widely spoken aboriginal language. The government estimates put the number of Amis people at a little over 200,000, but number of people who speak Amis as their first language as lower than 10,000. Amis has appeared in some mainstream popular music. Other significant indigenous languages includes Atayal, Paiwan, and Bunun. In addition to the recognized languages, there are around 10 to 12 groups of Taiwanese Plains Indigenous Peoples with their respective languages. Some indigenous people and languages are recognized by local governments, these include Siraya, Makatao and Taivoan. Some other language revitalization movements are going on Basay, Pazeh, Babuza-Taokas.\n\nMandarin is commonly known and officially referred to as the national language () in Taiwan. In 1945, following the end of World War II, Mandarin was introduced as the official language and made compulsory in schools. (Before 1945, Japanese was the official language and taught in schools.) Since then, Mandarin has been established as a lingua franca among the various groups in Taiwan: the majority Taiwanese-speaking Hoklo (Hokkien), the Hakka who have their own spoken language, the aboriginals who speak aboriginal languages; as well as Mainland Chinese immigrated in 1949 whose native tongue may be any Chinese variant.\n\nPeople who emigrated from China after 1949 (12% of the population) mostly speak Mandarin Chinese. Mandarin is almost universally spoken and understood. It was the only officially sanctioned medium of instruction in schools in Taiwan from late 1940s to late 1970s, following the handover of Taiwan to the government of the Republic of China in 1945, until English became a high school subject in the 1980s and local languages became a school subject in the 2000s.\n\nTaiwanese Mandarin (as with Singlish and many other situations of a creole speech community) is spoken at different levels according to the social class and situation of the speakers. Formal occasions call for the acrolectal level of Standard Chinese of Taiwan (), which differs little from the Standard Chinese of China (). Less formal situations may result in the basilect form, which has more uniquely Taiwanese features. Bilingual Taiwanese speakers may code-switch between Mandarin and Taiwanese, sometimes in the same sentence.\n\nMandarin is spoken fluently by almost the entire Taiwanese population, except for some elderly people who were educated under Japanese rule, and thus speak one or both of Hakka or Hokkien and Japanese. In Taipei, many Mainland Chinese immigrants and refugees settled around the time of the Kuomintang retreat to Taiwan and soon thereafter. Few of these mainlander immigrants spoke any Hokkien natively, let alone Taiwanese Hokkien/Taiwanese; as a result of this and other mainlander immigration to Taipei, Mandarin is used in greater frequency than in southern Taiwan and more rural areas. Many Taiwanese, particularly the younger generations, speak Mandarin better than Hakka or Hokkien, and it has become a lingua franca for the island amongst the Chinese dialects (fāngyán). In recent years, many Taipei-based students report speaking Mandarin as the language of their daily life, and speaking better English than Hakka or Hokkien even if they are from those ethnic backgrounds.\n\nCommonly known as Taiwanese (, ) and officially referred as Taiwanese Hokkien (); Taiwanese Hokkien is the most-spoken native language in Taiwan, spoken by about 70% of the population. Linguistically, it is a subgroup of Southern Min languages variety originating in southern Fujian province and is spoken by many overseas Chinese throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nThere are both colloquial and literary registers of Taiwanese. Colloquial Taiwanese has roots in Old Chinese. Literary Taiwanese, which was originally developed in the 10th century in Fujian and based on Middle Chinese, was used at one time for formal writing, but is now largely extinct. Due to the era of Taiwan under Japanese rule, a large amount of loanwords from Japanese also appear in Taiwanese. The loanwords may be read in Kanji through Taiwanese pronunciation or simply use the Japanese pronunciation. These reasons makes the modern writing Taiwanese in a mixed script of traditional Chinese characters and Latin-based systems such as pe̍h-ōe-jī or the Taiwanese romanization system derived from pe̍h-ōe-jī in official use since 2006.\n\nRecent work by scholars such as Ekki Lu, Sakai Toru, and Lí Khîn-hoāⁿ (also known as Tavokan Khîn-hoāⁿ or Chin-An Li), based on former research by scholars such as Ông Io̍k-tek, has gone so far as to associate part of the basic vocabulary of the colloquial language with the Austronesian and Tai language families; however, such claims are not without controversy. Recently there has been a growing use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media.\n\nAccent differences among Taiwanese dialects are relatively small but still exist. The standard accent — Thong-hêng accent () is sampled from Kaohsiung city, while other accents fall into a spectrum between \n\nA great part of Taiwanese Hokkien is generally understood by other dialects of Hokkien as spoken in China and South-east Asia (such as Singaporean Hokkien), but also has a degree of intelligibility with the Teochew variant of Southern Min spoken in Eastern Guangdong, China. It is, however, mutually unintelligible with Mandarin or other Chinese languages.\n\nHakka () is mainly spoken in Taiwan by people who have Hakka ancestry. These people are concentrated in several places throughout Taiwan. The majority of Hakka Taiwanese reside in Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli. Varieties of Taiwanese Hakka was officially recognized as national languages. Currently the Hakka language in Taiwan is maintained by the Hakka Affairs Council. This governmental agency also runs Hakka TV and Hakka Radio stations. The government currently recognizes and maintains five Hakka dialects (six, if Sixian and South Sixian are counted independently) in Taiwan.\n\nMatsu dialect (, \"Mā-cū-huâ\") is the language spoken in Matsu islands. It is a dialect of Fuzhou dialect, Eastern Min.\n\nTraditional Chinese characters is widely used in Taiwan to write Sinitic languages including Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka. The Ministry of Education maintains standards of writing for these languages, publications including the Standard Form of National Characters and the recommended characters for Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka.\n\nWritten vernacular Chinese is the standard of written Chinese used in official documents, general literature and most aspects of everyday life, and has grammar based on Modern Standard Mandarin. Vernacular Chinese is the modern written variant of Chinese that supplanted the use of classical Chinese in literature following the New Culture Movement of the early 20th Century, which is based on the grammar of Chinese spoken in ancient times. In recent times, following the Taiwan localization movement and an increasing presence of Taiwanese literature, written Hokkien based on the vocabulary and grammar of Taiwanese Hokkien is occasionally used in literature and informal communications.\n\nTraditional Chinese characters are also used in Hong Kong. A small number of characters are written differently in Taiwan; the Standard Form of National Characters is the orthography standard used in Taiwan and administered by the Ministry of Education, and has minor variations compared with the standardized character forms used in Hong Kong. Such differences relate to orthodox and vulgar variants of Chinese characters.\n\nLatin alphabet is native to Formosan languages and partially native to Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka. With the early influences of European missionaries, writing systems such as Sinckan Manuscripts, Pe̍h-ōe-jī, and Pha̍k-fa-sṳ were based on in Latin alphabet. Currently the official Writing systems of Formosan languages are solely based on Latin and maintained by the Council of Indigenous Peoples. The Ministry of Education also maintains Latin based systems Taiwanese Romanization System for Taiwanese Hokkien, and Taiwanese Hakka Romanization System for Hakka. The textbooks of Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka are written in a mixed script of Traditional Chinese characters and Latin alphabet.\n\nChinese language romanization in Taiwan tends to be highly inconsistent. Taiwan still uses the Zhuyin system and does not commonly use the Latin alphabet as the language phonetic symbols. Traditionally Wade–Giles is used. The central government adopted Tongyong Pinyin as the official romanization in 2002 but local governments are permitted to override the standard as some have adopted Hanyu Pinyin and retained old romanizations that are commonly used. However, in August 2008 the central government announced that Hanyu Pinyin will be the only system of Romanization of Standard Mandarin in Taiwan as of January 2009.\n\n\"Zhuyin Fuhao\", often abbreviated as \"Zhuyin\", or known as \"Bopomofo\" after its first four letters, is the phonetic system of Taiwan for teaching the pronunciation of Chinese characters, especially in Mandarin. Mandarin uses 37 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 consonants and 16 rimes. Taiwanese Hokkien uses 45 symbols to represent its sounds: 21 consonants and 24 rimes. There is also a system created for Hakka language.\n\nThese phonetic symbols sometimes appear as ruby characters printed next to the Chinese characters in young children's books, and in editions of classical texts (which frequently use characters that appear at very low frequency rates in newspapers and other such daily fare). In advertisements, these phonetic symbols are sometimes used to write certain particles (e.g., instead of ); other than this, one seldom sees these symbols used in mass media adult publications except as a pronunciation guide (or index system) in dictionary entries. Bopomofo symbols are also mapped to the ordinary Roman character keyboard (1 = \"bo\", q = \"po\", a = \"mo\", and so forth) used in one method for inputting Chinese text when using a computer.\n\nThe sole purpose for Zhuyin in elementary education is to teach standard Mandarin pronunciation to children. Grade one textbooks of all subjects (including Mandarin) are entirely in zhuyin. After that year, Chinese character texts are given in annotated form. Around grade four, presence of Zhuyin annotation is greatly reduced, remaining only in the new character section. School children learn the symbols so that they can decode pronunciations given in a Chinese dictionary, and also so that they can find how to write words for which they know only the sounds.\n\nTaiwan has a national sign language, the Taiwanese Sign Language, which was developed from Japanese Sign Language during Japanese colonial rule. TSL has some mutual intelligibility with Japanese Sign Language and the Korean Sign Language as a result. TSL has about a 60% lexical similarity with JSL.\n\nThe Japanese language was compulsorily taught while Taiwan was under Japanese rule (1895 to 1945). Although fluency is now largely limited to the elderly, most of Taiwan's youth who look to Japan as the trend-setter of the region's youth pop culture now might know a bit of Japanese through the media, their grandparents, or classes taken from private \"cram schools\".\n\nThere are a significant immigrant and spouses in Taiwan are from South-East Asia. \n\n\n\n\n"}

In designing the Eye, Ditko drew inspiration from the real world charm The All Seeing Eye of the Buddha, known among Buddhists as The Amulet of Snail Martyrs, a Nepali symbol meant to protect its wearer against evil. In film, the Eye contains the Time Stone, one of the fictional universe's Infinity stones, diverging from the comics' continuity where the Time Gem is owned by an ancient being named Ord Zyonz.\n\nAgamotto, a powerful mystic being and one of Doctor Strange's three Vishanti, is said to have used the Eye during his time as Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension. The Eye's origins are currently unknown, but there are theories of how it came into existence. Some believe that it was discovered by Agamotto among the seas and stars, where it had drifted for ages. Others claim that it was created by Agamotto himself, which makes sense when the Eye's powers are compared to those of \"the All-Seeing.\"\n\nIt is said that the Eye of Agamotto draws on Agamotto's own mystical ability to span distances and dispel disguises and illusions. Agamotto is also presumably aware of every time the Eye is used and may even record those events for later viewing.\n\nRintrah, a disciple of Doctor Strange, is able to call on many of the effects of the eye by using the 'Amulet Of Agamotto'.\n\nIn the \"New Avengers Annual\" #2 (2008), though Strange has at first retained both the Eye and the Cloak, the Hood, on Dormammu's commands, has targeted Strange to eliminate him and seize the Eye of Agamotto. Strange, having evoked Zom's power tells him that he is not ready to use it because of his tainted soul and demonic connection.\n\nStrange shows it to the New Avengers, describing the Eye as \"one of the most powerful mystic conduits on this physical plane.\" Strange and the New Avengers now battle against the forces of the Dark Dimension as Strange searches the planet for new potential candidates. The Eye is presented to the new Sorcerer Supreme, Brother Voodoo, in \"New Avengers\" #53, who bears it as he fights against Dormammu. Strange had lost the eye because of his own corrupted connection to Zom.\n\nLater, Doctor Doom arrives to challenge Brother Voodoo's 'claim' to the Eye. Doom claims the object must belong to him, for the protection of others, but abandons the Eye after using it to see his future, informing Brother Voodoo that he will gain nothing from it.\n\nWhen Doctor Strange and Daimon Hellstrom are possessed by an unspecified demonic entity, they attempt to claim the Eye from Doctor Voodoo, causing it to teleport to Avengers Mansion. Luke Cage touches the object and mutates in a monstrous version of himself, the entity that has possessed him subsequently 'jumping' into Iron Fist, who then teleports away with the Eye, triggering a rift in the sky that Strange states means the end of everything. As the Avengers battle the demons back on Earth, Iron Fist finds himself in a white void where he encounters the Ancient One, who claims that he is responsible for the current invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent 'failures'. When Iron Fist returns to Earth—now dressed in a new costume—-, he claims that the Ancient One has told him that Strange stole the Eye from the Ancient One rather than being given it by his master, challenging Strange to admit the truth. Noting that such a claim contradicts everything the Ancient One taught him about the Eye, Strange realises that the entity they are facing is not his master, with a casual comment by Spider-Man prompting the sorcerers to realise that the enemy they face is Agamotto himself, trying to reclaim his Eye after the apparent 'death' of the Vishanti. Although the group attempt to defeat Agamotto by empowering Wolverine to serve as their 'avatar', Doctor Voodoo is finally forced to sacrifice himself to contain their foe, apparently destroying himself and the Eye at the same time.\n\nThe Eye and Strange's Cloak of Levitation are seen in the 1992 Hulk graphic novel \"Future Imperfect\". Set a hundred years in the future, after a nuclear war, the cloak, tattered, and the Eye are among the many artifacts in the memorial room in the home of the Hulk associate Rick Jones. The same cloak and Eye are then stolen as part of a plot by Thanatos, a version of Rick Jones, who wished to become the ultimate version of himself. Thanks to other versions, including the elderly, Thanatos is stopped.\n\nThe Eye is used by the 2099 version of the Sorcerer Supreme, a young woman who hangs it on her jacket. It is used to keep her demonic half in check. She teams up with the 2099 version of Spider-Man.\n\nThe Eye is a weapon of wisdom that can radiate a powerful mystical light that allows Strange to see through all disguises and illusions, see past events, and track both ethereal and corporeal beings by their psychic or magical emissions. The light given off by the Eye also weakens a variety of evil mystical beings, such as demons, devils, undead beings, dark extradimensional entities, and even sufficiently corrupt human practitioners of the Dark Arts. Strange can use it to probe the minds of others, project a powerful mystical shield, and create portals to other dimensions. It has also been used to place beings into suspended animation, and it serves as the clasp for his Cloak of Levitation; during the early years of the Defenders Strange used the light of the Eye to levitate objects as heavy as the Hulk and Professor Xavier plus his wheelchair together, or the Thing, with minimal effort while simultaneously magically controlling the cloak to fly himself, carrying a total of at least seven Megagrams (fifteen thousand pounds). The Eye of Agamotto can be used to transport a group of dozens of beings of all kinds and power levels into another point within a universe, as Strange did to combat the threat of Thanos.\n\nThe Eye of Agamotto appears multiple times in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is wielded by Stephen Strange\n(Benedict Cumberbatch).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5535382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5535382", "title": "Cloak of Levitation", "text": "Cloak of Levitation\n\nThe Cloak of Levitation is a fictional item appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Cloak of Levitation is depicted as a potent mystical cloak worn by the superhero Doctor Strange. The item has been referred to as a \"relic\" in the live-action movie \"Doctor Strange\" (2016).\n\nThe primary purpose of the cloak is to give its wearer the ability to levitate and fly. The first appearance of the first (blue) cloak was in \"Strange Tales\" #114 (November 1963). The first appearance of the second (red) cloak was in \"Strange Tales\" #127 (December 1964).\n\nThere were two distinctly different cloaks worn by Doctor Strange bequeathed to him by his mentor, the Ancient One: a billowing, full-length blue cloak, that had minor abilities and spells woven into it, and the later, red cloak that Strange is usually seen wearing.\n\nThe original design of the red Cloak of Levitation has been modified slightly by different artists since its creation; this includes the 'horns' around the collar. However, for the most part, the basic shape and color scheme have remained the same. The cloak is full-length, with enough surface to fully cover Strange. Even though the color scheme of the cloak has varied somewhat over the years, the basic color is usually a darker red, often with yellow (golden) designs around the border and collar. Most versions of the cloak also feature an upraised collar. The cloak has the ability to change shape and shade inline with the wearer's will.\n\nWhile next to nothing is known about the Cloak of Levitation before it is given to Doctor Strange, it is suspected that the Cloak is many centuries old, since it was in the possession of the Ancient One.\n\nThe red cloak's first appearance is in \"Strange Tales\" #127, where, after Doctor Strange prevails in a battle with Dormammu, The Ancient One, having deemed him worthy to wear it, presents it to him as a prize for defeating Dormammu.\n\nThe Cloak of Levitation is seen in a great many battles where it often plays a very significant role. While it is extremely durable, there are a few occasions when it is damaged. Because of its mystical origins and properties, simply mending the cloak with a normal needle and thread is insufficient. Instead, a person with great knowledge of a mystical weaving technique must mend the garment, though as a test of worthiness for The Living Tribunal, Strange uses a large amount of mystical energy to reconstruct the cloak.\n\nIt is because of these repair requirements that Strange gains a friend and valuable ally. After the cloak is damaged in battle, it is sent to Enitharmon the Weaver to be repaired. After he finishes repairing the cloak, he sends it back in the hands of Rintrah, his assistant. After getting his valued cloak back, Doctor Strange offers Rintrah a position as his disciple, which he accepts. Rintrah himself later gains Strange's first, blue, levitation cloak, a separate object from the red one.\n\nAt one point the cloak becomes larger than the solar system when Doctor Strange confronts Adam Warlock, who had gone mad with near-infinite power and was obsessed with sizes.\n\nMisuse of magic (which included a bond with the demonic Zom) causes Doctor Strange's fate as Sorcerer Supreme to be left up in the air. After several days on the run from evil forces, Strange supervises the transfer of the title to the heroic Brother Voodoo. The new Sorcerer gains the cloak, now slightly modified, as part of his new status.\n\nWhile, through most of the series, Doctor Strange wears the same cloak, there are a few occasions where he stores his traditional cloak and uses a newly created cloak, though he always reverts to the Cloak of Levitation.\n\nIn the first instance, after going underground for a good deal of time, the Doctor resurfaces wearing a new Cloak of Levitation. This Cloak bears more resemblance to a kimono or a robe.\n\nAfter being drafted into the War of the Seven Spheres, where he does battle for five thousand years, he returns to his home dimension, his Kimono-like cloak in pieces. He repairs what's left of this Cloak into a third cloak of Levitation (sometimes called the \"Overcoat of Levitation\"), this one bearing resemblance to a trench coat.\n\nSometime after this, however, he abandons his new cloak in favor of his original, traditional Cloak of Levitation\n\nIn an alternate timeline with no Hank Pym and no Vision, Doctor Strange helps protect New York with a badly damaged cloak. Despite being torn, the cloak still allows him to levitate.\n\nThe Counter-Earth, a planet that orbits opposite of the regular Earth, has a version of Doctor Strange called the Necromancer. This sorcerer also has a cloak.\n\nThe cloak is seen in the Hulk graphic novel \"Future Imperfect\". Taking place a hundred years from 'now', after a nuclear war, the tattered cloak is shown as one of many items in the memorial-room home of the Hulk's associate Rick Jones. The same cloak is then stolen as part of a plot by Thanatos, a version of Rick Jones, who wished to become the ultimate version of himself. Thanks to other versions, including the elderly, Thanatos is stopped.\n\nThe cloak survives to the far future, in the Earth 691 timeline. Here, Doctor Strange passes his mantle and cloak down to the alien sorcerer Krugarr. The alien wears it consistently through his multiple appearances.\n\nIn an alternate reality involving the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos uses the Cloak to hang Dr. Strange, causing his death. This ties into the main series, where Thanos is using the gauntlet to control all of reality. Here, Strange is not slain with his cloak.\n\nIn the reality where Wolverine becomes lord of the vampires, a severely weakened Doctor Strange lends his cloak and the Eye of Agamotto to the Punisher. Though the vigilante uses it in an attempt to kill all vampires, Wolverine tears the cloak and eye off and kills him.\n\nThe cloak is seen in another trophy case, this time belonging to the Red Skull, one of the villainous rulers of a post-apocalypse America.\n\nThe Cloak of Levitation, as its name suggests, has the primary purpose of granting its wearer the ability to levitate. The greatest advantage of this is that its wearer need know little about the mystic arts in order to operate it, nor does the wearer need to use any of his \"mystical strength\" in order to operate it. While the cloak actually has no will of its own, it has been known to act on the will of its wearer without command, responding to mere thought. While the top speed of the cloak is unknown, it has been shown traveling at subsonic speeds. The maximum load-bearing weight of the cloak is also unknown, but Doctor Strange has been shown carrying passengers. In the miniseries \"The Oath\", it is suggested that the cloak exhibits semi-sentient behavior (such as hiding in a favorite closet).\n\nIn addition to levitation, the cloak possesses abilities greater than those of any normal garment. These include:\n\n\nThe cloak's noted similarity to a cape gets Doctor Strange an entry in the non-fiction book \"Caped Crusaders 101\".\n\n\n"}

It is blended and aged for a minimum of 7 years. It is a dark rum with a distinct vanilla flavour, with an alcohol content of 42.8%. It is produced in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, and was previously available in all parts of India.\n\nThere is no advertising, its popularity depends on word of mouth and loyalty of customers. However, in 2013 Old Monk lost its rank as the largest selling dark rum to McDowell’s No.1 Celebration Rum. Old Monk has been the biggest Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) brand for many years. \n\nOld Monk was ranked 5th among Indian spirits brands at the Impact International's 2008 list of \"Top 100 Brands At Retail Value\" with a retail value of US$240 million.\n\nIt is sold in six size variants: 90 ml, 180 ml, 375 ml, 500ml, 750 ml, and 1 litre bottles. \nOld Monk had been awarded gold medals at Monde World Selections since 1982. \n\nIn 1855, an entrepreneurial Scotsman named Edward Abraham Dyer, father of Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer of Jallianwala Bagh massacre, set up a brewery in Kasauli, Himachal Pradesh to cater to the British requirement for cheap beer. This brewery changed hands and became a distillery by the name of Mohan Meakin Pvt. Ltd.\n\nOld Monk, reportedly a creation of Ved Rattan Mohan, former managing director of Mohan Meakin, was first introduced in India in the 1960s. Mohan named the rum in honour of the Benedictine religious order of Christianity, with which he was fascinated. Before Old Monk, there was Hercules rum (still sold) that was distilled exclusively for the armed forces. Superior in taste and perhaps even in quality to Hercules (as loyalists believe), the brand soon became one of the leading dark rums in the world and perhaps the most popular IMFL (Indian-Made Foreign Liquor) brand in the country. The affordable pricing strategy has also worked in their favor. \nThere was a time when Old Monk dominated the rum market. There were other brands also but none came close in quality or popularity. About eight million bottles were sold annually. Today the sales are a quarter of that and they continue to decline. There were recent rumours about Old Monk closing down but its makers, Mohan Meakin Ltd, assured that Old Monk is not going to be taken off market. .\n\nWhile the 7 years aged XXX rum grade is the most popular, there are Supreme & Gold Reserve varieties which are gaining in popularity. These are aged for 12 years and are blended with highly matured spirits. Supreme also comes in a special bottle, with the shape of a standing monk. The top part of the monk's head is the bottle cap, which also doubles up as a peg measure.There is a limited edition that has been launched in 2013. The number of years it has been aged is unclear, the box states \"very old vatted\". The 1 litre bottle is in the shape of the old monk's face.\n\n\nOld Monk is sold by some retailers in Russia, United States, UK, Germany, Japan, UAE, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Canada, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Cameroon, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n"}

{"id": "5553566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5553566", "title": "Merdeka", "text": "Merdeka\n\nMerdeka is a word in the Indonesian and Malay language meaning independent or free. It is derived from the Sanskrit \"maharddhika\" (महर्द्धिक) meaning \"rich, prosperous and powerful\". In the Malay archipelago, this term had acquired the meaning of a freed slave.\n\nThe term \"Mardijker\" is a Dutch corruption of the Portuguese version of the original Sanskrit words and was used to designate former Portuguese and Dutch slaves from India in the East Indies, known as Mardijkers, whence the Malay meaning of \"free(dom)\" is derived. Mardijker are the former Catholic slaves brought from India and the East Indies that were liberated by the Dutch if they abandoned Catholicism and embraced the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nThe term was significant during the anticolonialist and pro-independence movements of the colonies of Indonesia, Malaya, and Singapore, in the history of Indonesia, history of Malaysia, and in the history of Singapore. It became a battle-cry for those demanding independence from the colonial administrations of the Netherlands and United Kingdom. In the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, the Moro people belonging to major ethno-linguistic groups of Meranaw, Maguindanaw and Iranun, use \"maradeka\" in the same meaning as freedom or liberation and freedom group there is called Maradeka.\n\nThe Tagalog term \"maharlika\" has the same Sanskrit origins as the Malay \"merdeka\" and means freeman, \"libertos\" or Freedman in classical Philippine society.\n\nThe term merdeka was used in Indonesia in a similar way to designate freedom from the Dutch colonial government during the struggle for independence in the 1940s. Republic of Indonesia declared its \"Hari Kemerdekaan Indonesia\" or Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945, and it has become national holiday and commemorated annually ever since.\n\nDuring the struggle of independence in 1945 to 1949, it was used as a national salute of victory and honor, by raising open palms as high as the head and shouting out loud \"Merdeka!\" From here many slogans came, such as \"Sekali Merdeka tetap Merdeka!\" (Freedom once and for all) or \"Merdeka atau Mati\" (Freedom or death). This was intended to raise the morale of all the people of Indonesia to continue to fight against the Dutch and the Allied forces trying to re-establish control over Indonesia; it was so important that even it became a Government Edict on 31 August 1945.\n\nOn 1 September it was mentioned by the president Sukarno in his short speech:\n\n\"\"Since today we will cry out loud, \"\"Merdeka!\"\" Continue on that loud battle cry, as the soul calls out loud for freedom! A soul of freedom, one of fighting and working spirit! TO FIGHT AND TO WORK! Prove it!\"\"\n\nThe name \"Merdeka\" is used as the name of Indonesian stately places, such as Merdeka Palace and Merdeka Square in central Jakarta, also Merdeka Building in Bandung.\n\nNowadays the Acehnese and West Papuan autonomy movements currently use the term to express the concept of freedom, and the meaning of the term ranges from greater freedom to outright political independence. The major autonomy movement in Aceh, the Free Aceh Movement has the term in its name (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka), as does the major armed independence group in West Papua, the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka). Nowadays too, some conservative and Nationalists had re-thought the 'Merdeka' stance of Indonesia, many question related to it such as \"Apakah kita benar-benar sudah merdeka?\" (Had we been really independent?). They used the term Merdeka as a motivational battle cry to the public for a change against the increasing free-fight liberalism, globalization, and neo-imperialism in terms of capitalism in Indonesia, though the word \"Semangat Reformasi\" (Spirit of the Reformation) had since now more been used.\n\n\"Merdeka\" is also used in the National Anthem of Indonesia.\n\n\"Indonesia Raya, Merdeka, Merdeka! Tanahku, Negeriku yang Kucinta. Indonesia Raya, Merdeka, Merdeka! Hiduplah Indonesia Raya!\"\n\nToday in Malaysia, in which Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged in 1963, the term still remains pertinent in the present. It can be seen in the Malaysian national holiday of Hari Merdeka, commemorating Malaya's independence on 31 August 1957, and Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square) where the first ceremony raising the flag of Malaya was held following independence. North Borneo and Sarawak in northern Borneo were to officially join to form Malaysia on 31 August 1963 but due to opposition from Indonesia and the Philippines and to allow the United Nations team time to conduct referendums in North Borneo and Sarawak regarding their participation in a new federation, the date was postponed to 16 September, which now celebrated as Malaysia Day.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman, the inaugural Malaysian Prime Minister, declared Malayan independence with seven shouts of \"Merdeka\"; the cry continues to be featured prominently in Malaysian Hari Merdeka celebrations.\n\nIn the context of Singapore, Merdeka usually refers to the gaining of self-rule and self-government from the United Kingdom in the 1950s, as imperialism in Asia slowly declined. It usually does not refer to Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, which followed its merger with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak on 16 September 1963 after having held the 1962 national referendum.\n\nThe Constitution of Singapore had been amended in 1953 following recommendations by the Rendel Commission, creating a 51-seat Legislative Assembly of Singapore to replace the Legislative Council of Singapore. The Legislative Assembly would become the predecessor to the modern Parliament of Singapore. The following Singapore general election of 1955 had members that were elected by the population for the first time become the majority in Singapore's legislature. Previously, only six members of the Legislative Council were elected — the rest were appointed. This however did not satisfy individuals calling for full self-government at least in the matter of domestic affairs.\n\nThe call for Merdeka was a growing tension between progressivism and radicalism, cooperation and hostility towards the British. David Saul Marshall of the Labour Front narrowly won the Singapore general election of 1955, but being anticolonialist, tended to be a vocal opponent of the British rule. As such, the British found it hard to work out a compromise. A petition was started in 1956 which collected the signatures of 167,000 — a vast portion of the electorate in that era — in a petition that demanded Merdeka.\n\nDuring the Merdeka Talks of 1956, the year before Malaya's independence, the British agreed to grant Singapore self-government over domestic issues, while the British retained control of finance and the military. This seemed to satisfy Marshall initially, but the negotiation later broke down when the British refused to turn over internal security to the local government. The British felt that Marshall was not doing enough to counter the threats of the communist insurgency and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which had sparked the Malayan Emergency. The march towards independence was stalled and Marshall resigned in 1956 making good on his earlier pledge that he would step down in the case of failure.\n\nAnother Labour Front leader Lim Yew Hock took over as Singapore's Chief Minister and continued the effort to push for independence. Lim then undertook harsh measures against the communists demonstrating that his administration was willing to take a tough stance to safeguard internal security. In the Chinese middle schools riots of 1956, some nine hundred people were arrested. Leading a negotiation delegation consisting of several Singapore political leaders from various parties, Lim managed to convince the British to grant Singapore Merdeka by amending and revamping its Constitution in 1958 to allow for a fully elected legislature which would form an internal government with complete autonomy over domestic affairs. This government was formed following the Singapore general election of 1959, but the Labour Front lost as Lim Yew Hock's harsh techniques had alienated large portions of the electorate.\n\nLooking on the Philippines, it has the longest running struggle for the Moro people right to self-determination and the cry for \"merdeka\" or \"maradeka\" had been since 1968 when Datu Udtog Matalam explosively announced the formation of the Mindanao Independence Movement (MIM) and the Muslim fundamentalist Ansar el Islam led by prominent Muslim leaders such as Philippine Muslim Senator Dr. Ahmad Domocao Alonto while leading the Islamic revival movement also supported the formation of the secessionist Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). The over four decades of Moro struggle asserts freedom from Philippine colonialism as argued by Moro stalwarts Prof. Nur Misuari of MNLF and late Ustadz Salamat Hashims of MILF. Until the present the struggle for freedom and independence still lived on to the younger Moro generation. At the legal front, the Maradeka (literally means freedom) became seen at the forefront of a non-violent political movement enjoying the democratic space afforded to many political groups and activists in the Philippines.\n\nAnalytically looking at the history of long peace process since 1975, while East Timor was able to attain full self governance thru a United Nations brokered Determination Vote and Free Aceh Movement acceded to a Norway brokered peace talks, the Moro rebel groups undergone series of protracted peace and a never ending peace process employed only as a counter-insurgency strategy of the Philippine government and not meant sincerely to achieve final solution to the hostilities in the southern part of the Philippines, Mindanao.

{"id": "5563228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5563228", "title": "Hellenistic astrology", "text": "Hellenistic astrology\n\nHellenistic astrology is a tradition of horoscopic astrology that was developed and practiced in the late Hellenistic period in and around the Mediterranean region, especially in Egypt. The texts and technical terminology of this tradition of astrology were largely written in Greek (or sometimes Latin). The tradition originated sometime around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE, and then was practiced until the 6th or 7th century CE. This type of astrology is commonly referred to as \"Hellenistic astrology\" because it was developed in the late Hellenistic period, although it continued to be practiced for several centuries after the end of what historians usually classify as the Hellenistic era.\n\nThe origins of much of the astrology that would later develop in Asia, Europe and the Middle East are found among the ancient Babylonians and their system of celestial omens that began to be compiled around the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE. This system later spread either directly or indirectly through the Babylonians to other areas such as China and Greece where it merged with preexisting indigenous forms of astrology. It came to Greece initially as early as the middle of the 4th century BCE, and then around the late 2nd or early 1st century BCE after the Alexandrian conquests this Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of Decanic astrology to create horoscopic astrology. This system is labeled as \"horoscopic astrology\" because, unlike the previous traditions, it employed the use of the ascendant, otherwise known as the \"horoskopos\" (\"hour marker\") in Greek, and the twelve celestial houses which are derived from it. The focus on the natal chart of the individual, as derived from the position of the planets and stars at the time of birth, represents the most significant contribution and shift of emphasis that was made during the Hellenistic tradition of astrology. This new form of astrology quickly spread across the ancient world into Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nAdditionally, some authors such as Vettius Valens and Paulus Alexandrinus took into account the Monomoiria, or individual degrees of a horoscope.\n\nThis complex system of astrology was developed to such an extent that later traditions made few fundamental changes to the core of the system, and many of the same components of horoscopic astrology that were developed during the Hellenistic period are still in use by astrologers in modern times.\n\nSeveral Hellenistic astrologers ascribe its creation to a mythical sage named Hermes Trismegistus. Hermes is said to have written several major texts which formed the basis of the art or its evolution from the system of astrology that was inherited from the Babylonians and the Egyptians. Several authors cite Hermes as being the first to outline the houses and their meaning, and thus the houses are usually thought to date back to the very beginning of the Hellenistic tradition and indeed they are one of the major defining factors which separate Hellenistic astrology and other forms of horoscopic astrology from Babylonian astrology and other traditions in different parts of the world. This system of horoscopic astrology was then passed to another mythical figure named Asclepius to whom some of the Hermetic writings are addressed.\n\nAccording to Firmicus Maternus, the system was subsequently handed down to an Egyptian pharaoh named Nechepso and his priest Petosiris. They are said to have written several major textbooks which explicated the system and it is from this text that many of the later Hellenistic astrologers draw from and cite directly. This system formed the basis of all later forms of horoscopic astrology.\n\nIn 525 BCE Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the zodiac, which included two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the Dendera Zodiac (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion’s Claws).\n\nAfter the occupation by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, Egypt came under Greek rule and influence. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in 'Alexandrian Egypt' that Babylonian astrology was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements.\nThe decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into ‘hours’. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BCE list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.\n\nParticularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy, who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the \"Tetrabiblos\" laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition. The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BCE, the Dendera Zodiac.\n\nAccording to Firmicus Maternus (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named Nechepso and his priest Petosiris. The Hermetic texts were also put together during this period and Clement of Alexandria, writing in the Roman era, demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:\nThis is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.\n\nThe conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to the cultures and cosmological ideas of Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from Cuneiform to Greek. Sometime around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of Kos in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what Campion calls, 'the innovative energy' in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.\nAccording to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the East was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BCE two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of horoscopes in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future, the other being theurgic, meaning literally 'god-work', and emphasised the soul's ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the divine.\n\nLike so much else, astrology came to Rome due to Greek influence. Among the Greeks and Romans, Babylonia or Chaldea was so identified with astrology that \"Chaldaean wisdom\" became the synonym of divination through the planets and stars. Astrologers became very much in vogue in Imperial Rome. Indeed, the emperor Tiberius had had his destiny predicted for him at birth, and so surrounded himself with astrologers such as Thrasyllus of Mendes. According to Juvenal 'there are people who cannot appear in public, dine or bathe, without having first consulted an ephemeris'. Claudius, on the other hand favoured augury and banned astrologers from Rome altogether. It is perhaps not surprising, that in the course of time, to be known as a \"Chaldaean\" carried with it frequently the suspicion of charlatanry and of more or less willful deception. One of the more famous examples of Roman literature concerning astrology is the poem \"Astronomica\", written in the first century AD by Marcus Manilius.\n\nHellenistic astrology was practiced from the 2nd century BCE until around the 7th century CE when Europe entered the Middle Ages. Astrology was then passed to and further developed by individuals working within the Islamic Empire from the 7th to the 13th century.\n\n\n"}

This became a diverse range of breads that include \"focaccia\" in Italian cuisine, \"hogaza\" in Spain, \"fogassa\" in Catalonia, \"fugàssa\" in Ligurian, \"pogača\" in the Balkans, pogácsa in Hungary, \"fougasse\" in Provence (originally spelled \"fogatza\"), \"fouace\" or \"fouée\" in other French regions and on the Channel Islands. The Provence version is more likely to have additions like olives, cheese, garlic or anchovies, which are like a primitive form of pizza without the tomato.\n\nThere is also in Portugal the \"fogaça\", a sweet bread. In Brazil, \"pão sovado\" is a typical big fougasse, while a recipe, typical of the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and surrounding regions, that is halfway between fougasse and bolillo (in these regions known as \"pão francês\" or \"pão-de-sal\"), somewhat resembling a savory small brioche, is called \"pão suíço\". They are perhaps the sweetest of savory artisanal bread recipes commonly made in Brazil.\n\nFougasse was traditionally used to assess the temperature of a wood fired oven. The time it would take to bake gives an idea of the oven temperature and whether the rest of the bread can be loaded.\n\nFougasse is also a type of pastry from Monaco that is topped with almonds and nuts.\n\nIt is used to make the French version of calzone, which can have cheese and small squarish strips of bacon inside the pocket made by folding over the bread.

{"id": "5575722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5575722", "title": "Fuck", "text": "Fuck\n\nFuck is an obscene English-language word which often refers to the act of sexual intercourse but is also commonly used as an intensifier or to denote disdain. While its origin is obscure, it is usually considered to be first attested to around 1475. In modern usage, the term \"fuck\" and its derivatives (such as \"fucker\" and \"fucking\") can be used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, an interjection or an adverb. There are many common phrases that employ the word as well as compounds that incorporate it, such as \"motherfucker,\" \"fuckwit\", \"fuckup\" and \"fucknut\".\n\nThe word is considered obscene but is commonly used in many informal and familiar situations.\n\nIt is unclear whether the word has always been considered vulgar or, if not, when it first came to be used to describe (often in an extremely angry, hostile or belligerent manner) unpleasant circumstances or people in an intentionally offensive way, such as in the term \"motherfucker\", one of its more common usages in some parts of the English-speaking world. Some English-speaking countries censor it on television and radio. Andrea Millwood Hargrave's 2000 study of the attitudes of the British public found that \"fuck\" was considered the third most severe profanity and its derivative \"motherfucker\" second. \"Cunt\" was considered the most severe.\n\nNevertheless, the word has become increasingly less vulgar and more publicly acceptable, an example of the \"dysphemism treadmill\", wherein former vulgarities become inoffensive and commonplace. According to linguist Pamela Hobbs, \"notwithstanding its increasing public use, enduring cultural models that inform our beliefs about the nature of sexuality and sexual acts preserve its status as a vile utterance that continues to inspire moral outrage.\" Hobbs considers \"users\" rather than \"usage\" of the word and sub-divides \"users\" into 'non-users', for whom the word \"evokes the core sexual meanings and associated sexual imagery that motivate the taboo\", and 'users' for whom \"metaphorical uses of the word \"fuck\" no more evoke images of sexual intercourse than a ten-year-old's 'My mom'll kill me if she finds out' evokes images of murder,\" so that the \"criteria of taboo are missing.\"\n\nBecause of its increasing usage in the public forum, in 2005 the word was included for the first time as one of three vulgarities in The Canadian Press's \"Canadian Press Caps and Spelling\" guide. Journalists were advised to refrain from censoring the word but use it sparingly and only when its inclusion was essential to the story.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the ultimate etymology is uncertain, but that the word is \"probably cognate\" with a number of Germanic words with meanings involving striking, rubbing and having sex or is derivative of the Old French word that meant \"to fuck.\"\n\nThe word has probable cognates in other Germanic languages, such as German \"ficken\" (to fuck); Dutch \"fokken\" (to breed, to beget); dialectal Norwegian \"fukka\" (to copulate), and dialectal Swedish \"focka\" (to strike, to copulate) and \"fock\" (penis). This points to a possible etymology where Common Germanic \"fuk-\" comes from an Indo-European root meaning \"to strike\", cognate with non-Germanic words such as Latin \"pugno\" \"I fight\" or \"pugnus\" \"fist\". By application of Grimm's law, this hypothetical root has the form *\"pug–\". There is a theory that \"fuck\" is most likely derived from Flemish, German, or Dutch roots, and is probably not derived from an Old English root.\n\nThere may be a kinship with the Latin \"futuere\" (\"futuo\"), a verb with almost exactly the same meaning as the English verb \"to fuck\". From \"fūtuere\" came French \"foutre\", Catalan \"fotre\", Italian \"fottere\", Romanian \"futere\", vulgar peninsular Spanish \"joder\", Portuguese \"foder\", and the obscure English equivalent \"to futter\", coined by Richard Francis Burton. However, there is no clear past lineage or derivation for the Latin word. These roots, even if cognates, are not the original Indo-European word for \"to copulate\", but Wayland Young argues that they derive from the Indo-European *\"bu–\" or *\"bug–\" (\"be\", \"become\"), or as causative \"create\" [see Young, 1964]. A possible intermediate might be a Latin 4th-declension verbal noun *\"fūtus\", with possible meanings including \"act of (pro)creating\".\n\nHowever, the connection to \"futuere\" has been disputedAnatoly Liberman calls it a \"coincidence\" and writes that it is not likely to have been borrowed from the Low German precursors to \"fuck\".\n\nGreek \"phyō\" (φύω) has various meanings, including (of a man) \"to beget\", or (of a woman), \"to give birth to\". Its perfect \"pephyka\" (πέφυκα) can be likened to \"fuck\" and its equivalents in other Germanic languages.\n\nOne reason that the word \"fuck\" is so hard to trace etymologically is that it was used far more extensively in common speech than in easily traceable written forms. There are several urban-legend false etymologies postulating an acronymic origin for the word. None of these acronyms were ever recorded before the 1960s, according to the lexicographical work \"The F-Word\", and thus are backronyms. In any event, the word \"fuck\" has been in use far too long for some of these supposed origins to be possible. Some of these urban legends are that the word \"fuck\" came from Irish law. If a couple were caught committing adultery, they would be punished \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge In the Nude,\" with \"FUCKIN\" written on the stocks above them to denote the crime. A similar variant on this theory involves the recording by church clerks of the crime of \"Forbidden Use of Carnal Knowledge.\" Another theory is that of a royal permission. During the Black Death in the Middle Ages, towns were trying to control populations and their interactions. Since uncontaminated resources were scarce, supposedly many towns required permission to have children. Hence, the legend goes, that couples that were having children were required to first obtain royal permission (usually from a local magistrate or lord) and then place a sign somewhere visible from the road in their home that said \"Fornicating Under Consent of King,\" which was later shortened to \"FUCK.\" This story is hard to document, but has persisted in oral and literary traditions for many years; however, it has been demonstrated to be an urban legend.\n\nA different false etymology, first made popular on the radio show \"Car Talk\", states that the phrase \"fuck you\" comes from the phrase \"pluck yew\" and relates the origins of \"fuck\" to the myth surrounding the V sign. This myth states that English archers believed that those who were captured by the French had their index and middle fingers cut off so that they could no longer operate their longbows, and that the V sign was used by uncaptured and victorious archers in a display of defiance against the French. The addition of the phrase \"fuck you\" to the myth came when it was claimed that the English yelled that they could still \"pluck yew\" (yew wood being the preferred material for longbows at the time), a phrase that evolved into the modern \"fuck you\".\n\n\"Fuck\" has a very flexible role in English grammar, including use as both a transitive and intransitive verb, and as an adjective, adverb, and noun. It can also be used as an interjection and a grammatical ejaculation. Linguist Geoffrey Hughes found eight distinct usages for English curse words, and \"fuck\" can apply to each. For example, it fits in the \"curse\" sense (\"fuck you!\") as well as the \"personal\" sense (\"You fucker\"). Its vulgarity also contributes to its mostly figurative sense, though the word itself is used in its literal sense to refer to sexual intercourse, its most common usage is figurative—to indicate the speaker's strong sentiment and to offend or shock the listener.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Paul Booth claimed to have found \"(possibly) the earliest known use of the word 'fuck' that clearly has a sexual connotation\": in English court records of 1310–11, a man local to Chester is referred to as \"Roger Fuckebythenavele\", probably a nickname. \"Either this refers to an inexperienced copulator, referring to someone trying to have sex with the navel, or it's a rather extravagant explanation for a dimwit, someone so stupid they think that this is the way to have sex,\" says Booth. An earlier name, that of John le Fucker recorded in 1278, has been the subject of debate, but is thought by many philologists to have had some separate and non-sexual origin.\n\nOtherwise, the usually accepted first known occurrence of the word is found in code in a poem in a mixture of Latin and English composed in the 15th century. The poem, which satirizes the Carmelite friars of Cambridge, England, takes its title, \"Flen flyys\", from the first words of its opening line, \"Flen, flyys, and freris\" (\"Fleas, flies, and friars\"). The line that contains \"fuck\" reads \"Non sunt in coeli, quia gxddbov xxkxzt pg ifmk\". Deciphering the phrase \"\"gxddbou xxkxzt pg ifmk\"\", here by replacing each letter by the previous letter in alphabetical order, as the English alphabet was then, yields the macaronic \"non sunt in coeli, quia fuccant vvivys of heli\", which translated means, \"They are not in heaven, because they fuck the women of Ely\". The phrase was probably encoded because it accused monks of breaking their vows of celibacy; it is uncertain to what extent the word \"fuck\" was considered acceptable at the time. The stem of \"fuccant\" is an English word used as Latin: English medieval Latin has many examples of writers using English words when they did not know the Latin word: \"\"workmannus\"\" is an example. In the Middle English of this poem, the term \"wife\" was still used generically for \"woman\".\n\nWilliam Dunbar's 1503 poem \"Brash of Wowing\" includes the lines: \"Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit: / Ye brek my hairt, my bony ane\" (ll. 13–14).\n\nThe oldest occurrence of the word in adjectival form (which implies use of the verb) in English comes from the margins of a 1528 manuscript copy of Cicero's \"De Officiis\". A monk had scrawled in the margin notes, \"fuckin Abbot.\" Whether the monk meant the word literally, to accuse this abbott of \"questionable monastic morals,\" or whether he used it \"as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay\" is unclear.\n\nJohn Florio's 1598 Italian-English dictionary, \"A Worlde of Wordes\", included the term, along with several now-archaic, but then-vulgar synonyms, in this definition:\nOf these, \"occupy\" and \"jape\" still survive as verbs, though with less profane meanings, while \"sard\" was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon verb \"seordan\" (or \"seorðan\", ON \"serða\"), to copulate; and \"swive\" had derived from earlier \"swīfan\", to revolve i.e. to swivel (compare modern-day \"screw\"). As late as the 18th century, the verb \"occupy\" was seldom used in print because it carried sexual overtones.\n\nA 1790 poem by George Tucker has a father upset with his bookish son say \"I'd not give [a fuck] for all you've read\". Originally printed as \"I'd not give ------ for all you've read\", scholars agree that the words \"a fuck\" were removed, making the poem the first recorded instance of the now-common phrase \"I don't give a fuck\".\n\nFarmer and Henley's 1893 dictionary of slang notes both the adverbial and adjectival forms of \"fuck\" as similar to but \"more violent\" than \"bloody\" and indicating extreme insult, respectively.\n\nThough it appeared in English lexicographer John Ash's 1775 \"A New and Complete Dictionary\", listed as \"low\" and \"vulgar,\" and appearing with several definitions, \"fuck\" did not appear in any widely consulted dictionary of the English language from 1795 to 1965. Its first appearance in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (along with the word \"cunt\") was in 1972.\n\nThe variant \"feck\" appeared in the \"English Dialect Dictionary\", compiled by Joseph Wright in 1900.\n\nThe modern usage and flexibility of \"fuck\" was established by the mid-to-late 19th century, and has been fairly stable since. Most literally, to \"fuck\" is to copulate, but it is also used as a more general expletive or intensifier. Some instances of the word can be taken at face value, such as \"Let's fuck,\" \"I would fuck her/him,\" or \"He/she fucks.\" Other uses connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or to both: The sexual connotation, usually connected to masturbation (in the case of \"go fuck yourself\" or \"go fuck yourself in the ass\"), is invoked to incite additional disgust, or express anger or outrage. For example, \"Fuck that!\", \"Fuck no!\", \"Fuck off!\", or \"Fuck you!\" By itself, \"fuck\" is usually used as an exclamation, indicating surprise, pain, fear, disgust, disappointment, anger, or a sense of extreme elation. In this usage, there is no connection to the sexual meaning of the word implied, and is used purely for its \"strength\" as a vulgarity. Additionally, other uses are similarly vacuous; \"fuck\" (or variations such as \"the fuck\" or \"fucking\") could be removed and leave a sentence of identical syntactical meaning. For example, rap music often uses the word \"fucking\" as an emphatic adjective (\"I'm the fucking man\") for the word's rhythmic properties. In British English, to express surprise and/or disbelief towards a given statement or a question, one can say \"does/is it fuck\".\n\nInsertion of the trochaic word \"fucking\" can also be used as an exercise for diagnosing the cadence of an English-language word. This is the use of \"fuck\" or more specifically \"fucking\" as an infix, or more properly, a tmesis (see expletive infixation). For example, the word \"in-fucking-credible\" sounds acceptable to the English ear, and is in fairly common use, while *\"incred-fucking-ible\" would sound very clumsy (though, depending on the context, this might be perceived as a humorous improvisation of the word). \"Abso-fucking-lutely\" and \"motherfucking\" are also common uses of \"fuck\" as an affix. While neither dysphemistic nor connected to the sexual connotations of the word, even the vacuous usages are considered offensive and gratuitous, and censored in some media; for example, \"None of your fucking business!\" or \"Shut the fuck up!\" A common insult is \"Get fucked\", which in a less-offensive context would translate as \"get stuffed.\" The word is one of the few that has colloquial usage as a verb, adverb, adjective, conjunction, interjection, noun, and pronoun.\n\nIn another usage, the word \"fucker\" is used as a term of endearment rather than antipathy. This usage is not uncommon; to say \"you're one smart fucker\" is often a term of affection. However, because of its ambiguity and vulgarity, the word \"fucker\" in reference to another person can easily be misinterpreted. Though \"fuck\" can serve as a noun, the \"fucker\" form is used in a context that refers to an individual. Normally in these cases, if \"fuck\" is used instead of \"fucker,\" the sentence refers to the sexual ability of the subject (for example, \"He's a great fuck!\"), although confusingly in a minority of occasions the word \"fuck\" can hold exactly the same meaning as \"fucker\" (e.g., when preceded by an adjective: \"You're a pretty clever fuck.\").\n\nRelated to \"fucker\" is the word \"motherfucker.\" Sometimes used as an extreme insult—an accusation of incest—this term is also occasionally used to connote respectful awe. For example, \"he's a mean motherfucker\" tends to imply: \"he's someone to be feared\". In this context, some people (particularly young men) might even describe themselves as \"motherfuckers.\" In a famous example, the wallet of \"Pulp Fiction\" character Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is embroidered with the phrase \"Bad Motherfucker\". The word \"fuck\" is used in many forms of music, with \"motherfucker\" being used as a rhythmic filler in hip hop, urban music and some rock genres; examples include The Crystal Method's song \"Name of the Game\" and Turbonegro's \"Don't Say Motherfucker Motherfucker\". \n\nThe word was used to induce stress during military recruit training and became a dominant element of an English military dialect identified by Tom Wolfe as \"Army creole\". A succinct example of the flexibility of the word is its use as almost every word in a sentence. In his book, \"Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War\", Paul Fussell, literary historian and professor emeritus of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, recounted\nIn the United States military air services, the nicknames applied to some aircraft included the word fucker as the letter \"F\" in their slang-acronyms. For instance, the B-52 stratofortress strategic bomber was often referred to as the BUFF, or Big Ugly Fat Fucker. Similarly, the A-7 Corsair was often referred to as the SLUF, or Short Little Ugly Fucker. In polite conversation, these acronyms usually substituted the word \"Fellow\" for fucker.\n\nThe phrase \"Fuck you, you fucking fuck!\" is a memorable quote from the movie \"Blue Velvet\" from 1986. Because of its vulgar status, the word \"fuck\" is usually restricted in mass media and barred from titles in the United States. In 2002, when the controversial French film \"Baise-moi\" (2000) was released in the US, its title was changed to \"Rape Me\", rather than the literal \"Fuck Me\". Similarly, the Swedish film \"Fucking Åmål\" was retitled \"Show Me Love\".\n\nOnline forums and public blogs may censor the word by use of automatic filters. For example, Fark.com replaces the word \"fuck\" with \"fark\". Others replace the word with asterisks (\"****\") to censor it (and other profanities) entirely. To avert these filters, many online posters will use the word \"fvck\". This particular alteration is in common usage at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students use it in reference to the inscriptions on MIT's neoclassical buildings, in which the letter \"U\" is replaced by \"V.\" A typical coinage in this idiom would be \"I'm fvcked by the Institvte.\" (Other less common spellings to cheat a censor are \"fück\" and \"phuck\".) Another way to bypass a word filter is to use leet: fuck becomes F(_) c|< or |=(_)Ck, for example.\n\nThe word \"fuck\" is a component of many acronyms, some of which—like \"SNAFU\" and \"FUBAR\"—date as far back as World War II. Many more recent coinages, such as the shorthand \"WTF?\" for \"what the fuck?,\" \"STFU\" for \"shut the fuck up,\" or \"FML\" for \"fuck my life,\" have been widely extant on the Internet, and may count as examples of internet memes. Many acronyms will also have an \"F\" or \"MF\" added to increase emphasis; for example, \"OMG\" (\"oh my God\") becomes \"OMFG\" (\"oh my fucking God\"). Abbreviated versions of the word do not tend to be considered offensive. Although the word is proclaimed vulgar, several comedians rely on \"fuck\" for comedic routines. George Carlin created several literary works based upon the word. Other comedians who use or have used the word consistently in their routines include Billy Connolly, Denis Leary, Lewis Black, Andrew Dice Clay, Chris Rock, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Sam Kinison.\n\nIn 1928, English writer D. H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" gained notoriety for its frequent use of the words \"fuck\", \"fucked\", and \"fucking\".\n\n\"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J. D. Salinger featured the use of \"fuck you\" in print. First published in the United States in 1951, the novel remains controversial to this day due in part to its use of the word, standing at number 13 for the most banned books from 1990 to 2000 according to the American Library Association.\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"fuck\" on live British television (and probably on any television system) has been attributed to theatre critic Kenneth Tynan in 1965, though it has been claimed Irish playwright Brendan Behan used the word on \"Panorama\" in 1956 (although no one could understand him because he was drunk) or the man who painted the railings on Stranmillis Embankment alongside the river Lagan in Belfast, who in 1959 told Ulster TV's teatime magazine programme, Roundabout, that his job was \"fucking boring\". Controversy also ensued in 1976 when \"Today\" host Bill Grundy interviewed the Sex Pistols, after guitarist Steve Jones called Grundy a \"dirty fucker\" and a \"fucking rotter\" (see EMI and the Grundy incident).\n\nJohn Cleese during his eulogy in the memorial service for Graham Chapman was proud to declare himself to be the first person to use the word \"fuck\" on such occasion.\n\nThe word began to break into cinema when it was uttered once in the film Vapor (1963) and in two Andy Warhol films - \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" (1965) and \"My Hustler\" (1965), and later in each of two 1967 British releases, \"Ulysses\" and \"I'll Never Forget What's'isname\". It was used several times in the 1969 British film \"Bronco Bullfrog\". According to director Robert Altman, the first time the word \"fuck\" was used in a major American studio film was in 1970's \"M*A*S*H\", spoken by Painless during the football match at the end of the film.\n\n\"Fuck\" is not widely used in politics, and use of the word by politicians often produces controversy. Some events include:\n\nDuring the George W. Bush presidency a vehicular bumper sticker with the words \"Buck Fush\" gained some popularity in the US.\n\nIn April 1997, clothing retailer French Connection began branding their clothes \"fcuk\" (usually written in lowercase), stating it was an acronym for \"French Connection United Kingdom\". Its similarity to the word \"fuck\" caused controversy. French Connection produced a range of T-shirts with messages such as \"fcuk this\", \"hot as fcuk\", \"mile high fcuk\", \"fcuk me\", etc.\n\nIn 2009, the European Union's OHIM trade marks agency disallowed a German brewery to market a beer called \"Fucking Hell\". They sued, and on 26 March 2010 got permission to market the beer. They claim that it is actually named after the Austrian village of Fucking and the German term for light beer, \"hell\" (which is simply the word for \"light in colour\").\n\nThe word \"fuck\" has been used in a number of band names, generally based on common compounds. Although most of these bands are in the aggressive, non-mainstream genres of punk and metal, others fall into the categories of more accessible forms of electronic rock and pop.\n\n\"Holy fuck\" is an example of 'liturgical profanity' used interjectionally to express anger, contempt, disgust, or amazement. Usually vulgar. Noted by academics and used in literature, deriving its power from a combination of the sacred, holy, and the profane, fuck. An exclamation, similar to \"holy shit\", but more offensive, also used informally for sex within a religious context.\n\nThe word \"fuck\" occurs sometimes in Chinese/English bilingual public notices in China as a machine translation of the Simplified Chinese character 干 (干), which replaced the three Traditional Chinese characters 干 meaning \"a pole\", 幹 meaning \"to do\" or \"to work\" (and having a secondary slang meaning of \"to fuck\"), and 乾 meaning \"dried\". (Traditional Chinese 乾 can also be pronounced \"qian\", which is a Taoist stem word meaning \"sky\".) Some examples are \"spread to fuck the fruit\" for \"loose dried fruit\", \"fuck to adjust the area\" for \"dry seasonings section\", and \"fuck the certain price of goods\" for \"dry foods price counter\". The fault occurred in some versions of commonly used Chinese to English machine translators, for example ( = \"Gold Mountain\") by Kingsoft.\n\nThe term \"dropping an F-bomb\" usually refers to the unanticipated use of the word \"fuck\" in an unexpected setting, such as public media, a play on the nickname for the hydrogen bomb (the \"H-bomb\") and the shock value that using the word \"fuck\" in discourse carries. The term was first reported in a newspaper (Newsday) in 1988 when Hall of Fame baseball catcher Gary Carter used it. In 2012 it was listed, for the first time, in the mainstream \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\".\n\nOn August 19, 1969 the acid rock band Jefferson Airplane played their song \"We Can Be Together\" uncensored on \"The Dick Cavett Show\", including the 1960s countercultural slogan \"Up against the wall, motherfucker!\" (which was also the name of an anarchist group at that time). This was the first appearance of the word on U.S. television. The word \"motherfucker\" was also censored on the song's printed lyrics that came with the Volunteers album as \"fred.\"\n\nFilms edited for broadcast use matching euphemisms so that lip synching will not be thrown off. In the film \"The Big Lebowski\", John Goodman's character repeatedly yells, \"This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass\" while trashing a car. It was censored on television as \"This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps.\"\n\nIn 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the public display of \"fuck\" is protected under the First and Fourteenth amendments and cannot be made a criminal offense. In 1968, Paul Robert Cohen had been convicted of disturbing the peace for wearing a jacket with a slogan titled \"Fuck the Draft\" (in a reference to conscription in the Vietnam War). The conviction was upheld by the court of appeals and overturned by the Supreme Court. \"Cohen v. California\", \"403 U.S. 15\" (1971).\n\nIn conversation or writing, reference to or use of the word \"fuck\" may be replaced by any of many alternative words or phrases, including \"the F-word\" or \"the F-bomb\" (a play on \"A-bomb\" and \"H-bomb\"), or simply, \"eff\" or \"f\" (as in \"What the eff\" or \"You effing fool\", \"What the F\" or \"You f'ing fool\"). Also, there are many commonly used substitutes, such as \"flipping\", \"frigging\", \"fricking\", \"freaking\", \"feck\", \"fudge\", \"flaming\" or any of a number of similar-sounding nonsense words. In print, there are alternatives such as, \"F***\", \"F––k\", etc.; or a string of non-alphanumeric characters, for example, \"@$#*%!\" and similar (especially favored in comic books).\n\nA replacement word used mainly on the Internet is \"fsck\", derived from the name of the Unix \"f\"ile \"s\"ystem \"c\"hec\"k\"ing utility. In \"Battlestar Galactica\" the bowdlerized form 'frack' (spelt 'f-r-a-k' in the reimagined 2003 version) was used as a substitute for fuck. The word was sometimes jokingly used as a curse by fans. Similarly, the word \"frell\" is used as a substitute on the TV show \"Farscape\", and Dr. Elliot Reid (played by Sarah Chalke) has frequently used the substitute \"frick\" on the TV show \"Scrubs\". Stu Braudy, a recurring character on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" played by Don Stark, is teased by Larry David for constantly using the substitute \"freak\" (\"Ahh, freak you!\").\n\nThe phrase \"feck\" is a common substitute for \"fuck\" in Ireland, where it is considered to be less rude, though still not acceptable in many contexts. It has come into occasional use across the UK in the last 15 years as a result of its frequent use in the \"Father Ted\" comedy series. Although the word is considered to be equally as rude as \"fuck\", its appearance in \"Father Ted\" and in a Magner's Cider ad suggest the opposite.\n\n\n"}

The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread filled with the contents of one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. \n\nThe sandwich's connection to the singer Elvis Presley is the source of its legend and prolonged interest. According to \"The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley\", Presley and his friends took his private jet from Graceland, purchased 28 of the sandwiches, and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.\n\nThere are two accounts on the origin of Fool's Gold Loaf. According to Graeme Wood, the Fool's Gold Loaf was created by Cindy and Buck Scott, owners of the Colorado Mine Company restaurant. Wood writes that Elvis obtained the recipe from the Scotts, so his personal chef could make it, but noted that \"the Fool's Gold Loaf never made a recorded encore\".\n\nAccording to Nick Andurlakis, he helped create the sandwich while he was working at the Colorado Mine Company as a chef and suggested the Fool's Gold Loaf to Elvis. Andurlakis said that he personally delivered the sandwiches to Elvis on the famous night.\n\nThe sandwich was named to fit the mining motif of the restaurant. At the time of Elvis's famous outing, the Fool's Gold Loaf cost $49.95 ().\n\nThe recipe has been repeated by numerous sources, including \"The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley\" and Andurlakis, a chef at the Colorado Mine Company.\n\nThe Fool's Gold Loaf begins with a loaf of French white bread that is covered in two tablespoons of margarine and baked in the oven at 350F/180C until brown. One pound of sliced bacon is fried in oil until crispy and drained. The loaf is sliced lengthwise, hollowed out, and filled with peanut butter, grape jelly and bacon.\n\nAccording to Andurlakis, he personally served Elvis the Fool's Gold Loaf with bacon, peanut butter, and blueberry preserves on a loaf of French bread. The specific type of preserves was allegedly Dickinson's blueberry preserves.\n\nDavid Adler's book contains a detailed account of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. \n\nKennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the \"Lisa Marie\", and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 22 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.\n\nThe Fool's Gold Loaf connection to Elvis dominates the media's coverage of the subject. It was widely reported as \"legend\" by the media; including the NBC's Today, Joplin Globe, and Gloucester Times. Doug Clark, a columnist for The Spokesman Review, recounts the popular story and writes that the Fool's Gold Recipe is \"surprisingly tasty\" and notes that it contains around . The popular legend and sandwich were also noted by the Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nThe Fool's Gold Loaf has been included in numerous publications and cookbooks. The Fool's Gold Loaf was included and generated national interest with David Alder's book \"The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley\". Alder's work would continue with the television documentary: \"The Burger and The King\". Another publication by Alder, \"Eating the Elvis Presley Way\" was later released.\n\nThe Fool's Gold Loaf has been detailed in \"Ramble Colorado: The Wanderer's Guide to the Offbeat, Overlooked, and Outrageous\". \"The Peanut Butter and Co. Cookbook\" refers to the Fool's Gold Loaf legend and ties it to the peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich, also known as the \"Elvis sandwich\".\n\nIn addition, the sandwich and its connection to Elvis Presley is featured in the 2013 romantic comedy \"The F Word (What If)\", with \"The Last Leg\" showing it off as well in order to promote the film.\n\nA Fool's Gold Loaf was one of the ingredients used in the 2018 \"Grill Masters: Memphis\" episode of \"Chopped\".\n\n\n"}

It dates back to the Spanish conquest when European and traditional Creole recipes were combined. It is made by hand with cow's milk or goat through a process known as \"filado\" or spinning, which grants the product its distinctive characteristics.\n\nIn Chile and Bolivia, \"quesillo\" refers to a type of small fresh cheese. It is a popular farm cheese of the Cochabamba valley; and is usually made from raw cow milk, pepsin and acid coagulation, a maize size curd, and a dry-salted, hand-formed, palm-size mold. After resting for two or three hours it has a crumbly consistency and is ready to eat.\n\nIn the Canary Islands of Spain, \"quesillo\" refers to a dessert that is a type of flan made with whole eggs and sweetened condensed milk, which makes for a firmer texture than traditional flan. The Canary or Spanish \"quesillo\" is somewhat similar to the Venezuelan \"quesillo\" (read below) in that both are desserts.\n\nIn Colombia, \"quesillo\" refers to a type of double cream cheese wrapped within a plantain leaf, made originally in the Tolima Department; the town of Guamo is most known for this dairy product. It is made commercially in dairy regions such as Bogotá, Ubaté and other regions of Cundinamarca and Antioquia. Famous brands of Colombian \"quesillo\" include \"Pasco\" and \"Colanta.\"\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, \"quesillo\" refers to dessert. Recipes vary slightly, but the dish is basically Flan made out of eggs and sweetened milk.\n\nIn Mexico, \"quesillo\" refers to a very popular type of string cheese sold in balls of various sizes. It is also known as \"Queso Oaxaca\" or Oaxacan cheese.\n\n In Nicaragua, \"quesillo\" refers to a dish typically made from a thick corn tortilla wrapped around soft cheese (with the same name and of consistency similar to mozzarella cheese), pickled onions, and a sauce of sour cream or liquid cheese and vinegar. Originally from the León Department, there is a great dispute as to where they were invented, if in either of the municipalities of Nagarote or La Paz Centro. The main difference between the two is that La Paz Centro's \"quesillos\" use purple onions. They are often sold on roadsides as a quick snack or in the street by \"quesilleras\", women who sell \"quesillos\". The most famous \"quesillo\" stands are located on the highway between the cities of León and Managua. \n\nA popular pun of this locale is to alter the phrase \"claro que si\", meaning \"of course\", into \"claro quesillos\". Because of their runny contents, \"quesillos\" are usually confined by a thin plastic sheath. Often the plastic bag is tied off, a small corner is bitten off, and the \"quesillo\" is squeezed out of a small hole in the corner.\n\nIn Peru, \"quesillo\" refers to small patties of fresh cheese. The cheese is typically made by small home producers and sold by women on streets and in markets and small shops. This form of cheese is particularly common in Andean regions where it is used in stews and soups.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"quesillo\" refers to various soft, white, unaged cheeses made from carabao or goat milk curdled with vinegar, citrus juices, and sometimes rennet. It is nativized into various spellings depending on the region. In the island of Luzon, it is known as \"kesong puti\" in Tagalog or \"kesilyo\" (or \"kasilyo\") in Caviteño. In Cebu, a similar cheese is known as \"queseo\" or \"kiseyo\".\n\nIn Venezuela, the term \"quesillo\" refers to a type of dessert made with eggs, condensed milk, and caramelized sugar. The Venezuelan quesillo is similar to the French-Spanish known as Crème Caramel or flan. The original recipe dating back to the 18th century does not use condensed milk but milk and sugar at a ratio of four cups of milk to one pound of sugar\n\nThis dessert plate is also popular on the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao which are just off the north coast of Venezuela. In the Philippines, the dish is known as leche flan.\n\nIt is sweet and jelly-like, with a distinctive taste (not entirely like Crème Caramel).\n\n"}

Machines for producing these do not require a pressure chamber, and as a result, they are much cheaper and easier to maintain. There are variations including frozen carbonated beverages, typified by the Slurpee or ICEE, which are made by freezing a carbonated drink. Machines for producing these are complicated and expensive, and notably require a carbon dioxide supply. They make a very fine and 'dry' slush. There are also frozen coffee beverages and frozen alcoholic beverages, as well as more conventional slush drinks. There are also \"instant\" slush drinks formed via supercooling. Several examples include Slushie, which allows consumers to make beverages that turn to slush upon opening using a conventional freezer; the Chill Chamber, which allows businesses to store beverages at below freezing temperatures that turn to slush upon opening; and supercooled Sprite from Coca-Cola (briefly marketed in the UK), which required special vending machines to store the bottles in a supercooled state so that they would turn to slush upon opening.\n\nChipped ice in water is the standard for the freezing point of water, 0 °C (32 °F). Ice made from water can be 0 °C, or a much lower temperature. The agitation of the machines is partially to keep the water from freezing solid. Some of the drinks have additives to make the freezing temperature of the mix lower, so that the drink can be much colder than a water slush drink.\n\nSlush is made by a mixture of sugar and water. To prevent the mixture from freezing solid, there must be between 12% - 22% of sugar present in the solution. The sugar acts as an antifreeze in the solution. The slush machine stirs or rotates the mixture at a constant speed so that the sugar and water molecules bond together before the water gets a chance to freeze. In this way, a soft, wet slurry mixture is formed.\n\n"}
{"id": "5596655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5596655", "title": "Early effect", "text": "Early effect\n\nThe Early effect, named after its discoverer James M. Early, is the variation in the effective width of the base in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) due to a variation in the applied base-to-collector voltage. A greater reverse bias across the collector–base junction, for example, increases the collector–base depletion width, thereby decreasing the width of the charge carrier portion of the base.\n\nIn Figure 1, the neutral (i.e. active) base is green, and the depleted base regions are hashed light green. The neutral emitter and collector regions are dark blue and the depleted regions hashed light blue. Under increased collector–base reverse bias, the lower panel of Figure 1 shows a widening of the depletion region in the base and the associated narrowing of the neutral base region.\n\nThe collector depletion region also increases under reverse bias, more than does that of the base, because the collector is more heavily doped relative to the base. The principle governing these two widths is charge neutrality. The narrowing of the collector does not have a significant effect as the collector is much longer than the base. The emitter–base junction is unchanged because the emitter–base voltage is the same.\n\nBase-narrowing has two consequences that affect the current:\n\n\nBoth these factors increase the collector or \"output\" current of the transistor with an increase in the collector voltage, but only the second is called Early effect. This increased current is shown in Figure 2. Tangents to the characteristics at large voltages extrapolate backward to intercept the voltage axis at a voltage called the Early voltage, often denoted by the symbol V.\n\nIn the forward active region the Early effect modifies the collector current (formula_1) and the forward common-emitter current gain (formula_2), as typically described by the following equations:\n\nWhere\n\nSome models base the collector current correction factor on the collector–base voltage \"V\" (as described in base-width modulation) instead of the collector–emitter voltage \"V\". Using \"V\" may be more physically plausible, in agreement with the physical origin of the effect, which is a widening of the collector–base depletion layer that depends on \"V\". Computer models such as those used in SPICE use the collector–base voltage \"V\".\n\nThe Early effect can be accounted for in small-signal circuit models (such as the hybrid-pi model) as a resistor defined as\n\nin parallel with the collector–emitter junction of the transistor. This resistor can thus account for the finite output resistance of a simple current mirror or an actively loaded common-emitter amplifier.\n\nIn keeping with the model used in SPICE and as discussed above using formula_10 the resistance becomes:\n\nwhich almost agrees with the textbook result. In either formulation, formula_12 varies with DC reverse bias formula_10, as is observed in practice.\n\nIn the MOSFET the output resistance is given in Shichman–Hodges model (accurate for very old technology) as:\n\nwhere formula_15 = drain-to-source voltage, formula_16 = drain current and formula_17 = channel-length modulation parameter, usually taken as inversely proportional to channel length \"L\".\nBecause of the resemblance to the bipolar result, the terminology \"Early effect\" often is applied to the MOSFET as well.\n\nThe expressions are derived for a PNP transistor. For an NPN transistor, n has to be replaced by p, and p has to be replaced by n in all expressions below.\nThe following assumptions are involved when deriving ideal current-voltage characteristics of the BJT\n\n\nIt is important to characterize the minority diffusion currents induced by injection of carriers.\n\nWith regard to pn-junction diode, a key relation is the diffusion equation.\n\nA solution of this equation is below, and two boundary conditions are used to solve and find formula_19 and formula_20.\n\nThe following equations apply to the emitter and collector region, respectively, and the origins formula_22, formula_23, and formula_24 apply to the base, collector, and emitter.\n\nA boundary condition of the emitter is below:\n\nThe values of the constants formula_27 and formula_28 are zero due to the following conditions of the emitter and collector regions as formula_29 and formula_30.\n\nBecause formula_32, the values of formula_33 and formula_34 are formula_35 and formula_36, respectively.\n\nExpressions of formula_38 and formula_39 can be evaluated.\n\nBecause insignificant recombination occurs, the second derivative of formula_41 is zero. There is therefore a linear relationship between excess hole density and formula_42.\n\nThe following are boundary conditions of formula_44.\n\nwith W the base width. Substitute into the above linear relation.\n\nWith this result, derive value of formula_47.\n\nUse the expressions of formula_47, formula_38, formula_51, and formula_52 to develop an expression of the emitter current.\n\nSimilarly, an expression of the collector current is derived.\n\nAn expression of the base current is found with the previous results.\n\n"}
{"id": "5602234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5602234", "title": "Finnish tango", "text": "Finnish tango\n\nFinnish tango (), or FINtango, music is an established variation of the Argentine tango but whose rhythm follows the Ballroom tango. It was one of the most popular music forms for decades in Finland. Brought to Europe in the 1910s, and to Finland itself in 1913, by travelling musicians, Finns began to take up the form and write their own tangos in the 1930s. The first Finnish tango was written by Emil Kauppi in 1914 for a film called Salainen perintömääräys (meaning The Secret Testament). It features a typical Finnish rhythm pattern with habanera. In the 1920s the tango was danced exclusively by Helsinki’s bohemians. By the 1940s about half of the entries on the popular music charts were occupied by tangos, and the post war period saw tangos spread from a popular urban phenomenon to their enthusiastic adoption by the countryside as well. Finnish tango peaked in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Special characteristics of Finnish tango include the change of rhythm to beguine during chorus. Also habanera rhythm is used often. The bandoneon was replaced by the accordion and drums were added.\n\nThe Finnish tango is distinguished from other forms of tango by its almost exclusive performance in minor keys and themes reflecting established conventions in Finnish folklore. As the head of the Finnish National Broadcaster's gramophone library explains, \"The central themes of Finnish tango lyrics are love, sorrow, nature and the countryside. Many tangos express a longing for the old homestead, or a distant land of happiness. The changing seasons of Finnish nature are frequently used metaphors: the spring breaks the hold of the winter, and flowers appear, creating new expectations. Autumn rains and dark evenings are symbols of crushed hopes.\"\n\nOne of the highlights of Finnish summers is the Tangomarkkinat, or tango festival, held annually since 1985 in the central Finnish town of Seinäjoki. The festival attracts more than 100,000 participants annually (from a population of just over 5 million) and is capped by the coronation of the tango King and Queen, who receive much domestic media attention and often recording contracts as well. Another tango festival is the International Helsinki Frostbite Tango Festival. The city of Tampere hosts the much smaller annual Maailmantango (World of Tango festival). \n\nThe most well known Finnish tango composers are Olavi Virta (\"Punatukkaiselle tytölleni\"), Toivo Kärki (\"Liljankukka\") and Unto Mononen (\"Satumaa\").\n\nTango was first performed in Finland by Finns in 1913. Since then tango has evolved in Finland to a distinctive form.\n\nFinnish tango as a dance has characteristics that differ from both competitive and Latin American tango(s). There is a close contact in the pelvis, upper thighs, and the upper body. Finnish tango is often taught with a SSQQ (slow, slow, quick, quick) basic step sequence, with QQS or SQQ used for the beguine or habanera parts so often found in Finnish tango pieces, although a skilled dancer might use slows and quicks just as he wishes to match either the melody or the rhythm. Dips and rotations are frequent. There are no kicks or aerials in Finnish tango. Typically feet stay close to the floor, except in dips the follower might slightly raise the left leg.\n\nSteps forward are mainly heel-leads. Only if a forward step is taken during a fall (descending from a rise), the ball touches the floor first. When moving backwards, the heel pushes off the floor. The step sequence may be executed either by closing the last quick step or by letting feet pass each other. The dance is horizontal with optional rises and falls; steps are low and to allow this, the dance position is low with the supporting leg bent. The passing leg moves quickly to rest for a moment close to the grounded leg. Compared to Argentine tango, Finnish tango is more related to (slow) foxtrot, but the feel is different because the weight shift happens close to the end of the beat and the pushing foot will accelerate only to pause next to the grounded one before it moves forward to a long step that is made even longer by pushing off the other leg in the end. Finnish tango requires a lot of space.\n\nThe Tangomarkkinat festival also hosts dancing competitions, among them Finnish tango. Non-Finnish contestants also participate.\n"}

It was created at the Savoy Hotel in London by its then Maitre Chef de Cuisine, Francis Latry. It was one of a number of recipes commended to the British public by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War to enable a nutritious diet to be maintained despite shortages and rationing of many types of food, especially meat. It was named after Frederick Marquis, 1st Lord Woolton (1883–1964), who popularised the recipe after he became Minister of Food in 1940.\n\nThe recipe involved dicing and cooking potatoes (or parsnips), cauliflower, swede, carrots and possibly turnip. Other vegetables were added where available. Rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water which was poured over the vegetables themselves. The dish was topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy. The content of the pie filling could easily be altered to include whatever vegetables were in season at the time.\n\nPeople realised that meat was in very scarce supply, but that still did not overcome traditions of meat pies. Woolton pie, entirely lacking meat, was not universally well received. An editorial in \"The Times\" commented:\nProfessor John Fuller has noted that Woolton pie and similar wartime austerity dishes \"were forgotten as quickly as possible when conditions returned to normal\". (One notable exception to this pattern is carrot cake which, while not invented during the war, was popularised in the United Kingdom during that period because it used the widely available root vegetable in place of some of the scarce flour, fat and sugar found in other cakes.)\n\nThe recipe for Woolton pie has been published on a number of occasions since the war, notably in collections to mark significant anniversaries, e.g. Marguerite Patten's (1985) \"We'll Eat Again\", marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Irish distillers owned the brand until its sale to Sazerac in 2016. As of 2016, Paddy is the fourth largest selling Irish whiskey in the World. \n\nThe Cork Distilleries Company was founded in 1867 to merge four existing distilleries in Cork city (the North Mall, the Green, Watercourse Road, and Daly's) under the control of one group. A fifth distillery, the Midleton distillery, joined the group soon after in 1868. \n\nIn 1882, the company hired a young Corkman called Paddy Flaherty as a salesman. Flaherty travelled the pubs of Cork marketing the company's unwieldy named \"\"Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey\"\". His sales techniques (which including free rounds of drinks for customers) were so good, that when publicans ran low on stock they would write the distillery to reorder cases of \"Paddy Flaherty's whiskey\". In 1912, with his name having become synonymous with the whiskey, the distillery officially renamed the whiskey \"Paddy Irish Whiskey\" in his honour. \n\nIn 1920s and 1930s in Ireland, whiskey was sold in casks from the distillery to wholesalers, who would in turn sell it on to publicans. To prevent fluctuations in quality due to middlemen diluting their casks, Cork Distilleries Company decided to bottle their own whiskey known as Paddy, becoming one of the first to do so.\n\nIn 1988, following an unsolicited takeover offer by Grand Metropolitan, Irish Distillers approached Pernod Ricard and subsequently became a subsidiary of the French drinks conglomerate, following a friendly takeover bid. \n\nIn 2016, Pernod Ricard sold the Paddy brand to Sazerac, a privately held American firm for an undisclosed fee. Pernod Ricard stated that the sale was in order \"simplify\" their portfolio, and allow for more targeted investment in their other Irish whiskey brands, such as Jameson and Powers. \n\nAt the time of the sale, Paddy was the fourth largest selling Irish whiskey brand in the world, with sales of 200,000 9-litre cases per annum, across 28 countries worldwide.\n\nPaddy whiskey is distilled three times and matured in oak casks for up to seven years. Compared with other Irish whiskeys, Paddy has a comparatively low pot still content and a high malt content in its blend. \n\nJim Murray, author of the Whiskey bible, has rated Paddy as \"one of the softest of all Ireland's whiskeys\".\n\n"}

Some countries eat cat meat regularly, whereas others have only consumed cat meat in desperation during wartime or poverty.\n\nPrehistoric human feces have contained bones from the wild cat of Africa.\n\nIn some cultures of Cameroon, there is a special ceremony featuring cat-eating that is thought to bring good luck.\n\nIn Guangdong and Guangxi provinces in south-eastern China, some—especially older—people consider cat flesh a good warming food during winter months. It is estimated that in southern China's Guangdong province people eat 10,000 cats per day.\n\nIn Guangdong, cat meat is a main ingredient in the traditional dish \"dragon, tiger, phoenix\" (snake, cat, chicken), which is said to fortify the body.\n\nOrganized cat-collectors supply the southern restaurants with animals that often originate in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces. On 26 January 2010 China launched its first draft proposal to protect the country's animals from maltreatment including a measure to jail people, for periods up to 15 days, for eating cat or dog meat.\n\nWith the increase of cats as pets in China, opposition towards the traditional use of cats for food has grown. In June 2006, approximately 40 activists stormed the Fangji Cat Meatball Restaurant in Shenzhen, forcing it to shut down. Expanded to more than 40 member societies, the Chinese Animal Protection Network in January 2006 began organizing well-publicized protests against dog and cat consumption, starting in Guangzhou, following up in more than ten other cities \"with very optimal response from public.\"\n\nIn Japan, cat meat was consumed until the end of Tokugawa period in the 19th century.\n\nIn Korea, cat meat was historically brewed into a tonic as a folk remedy for neuralgia and arthritis. Modern consumption is decreasing and more likely to be in the form of cat soup.\n\nCat meat is eaten in Vietnam, even though it is technically illegal. It is generally seen on menus with the euphemism \"tiểu hổ\", literally \"baby tiger\" rather than the literal \"thịt mèo\". Cat galls have aphrodisiacal properties according to people in North Vietnam.\n\nIn June 2008, three students at the Danish School of Media and Journalism published pictures of a cat being slaughtered and eaten in \"Citat\", a magazine for journalism students. Their goal was to create a debate about animal welfare. The cat was shot by its owner, a farmer, and it would have been put down in any case. The farmer slaughtered the cat within the limits of Danish law. This led to criticism from Danish animal welfare group Dyrenes Beskyttelse, and death threats received by the students.\n\nIn 18th-century Britain, there are a few records of cats being eaten as a form of entertainment.\n\nIn February 2010, on a television cooking show, the Italian food writer Beppe Bigazzi mentioned that during the famine in World War II cat stew was a \"succulent\" and well known dish in his home area of Valdarno, Tuscany. Later he claimed he had been joking, but added that cats used to be eaten in the area during famine periods, historically. He was widely criticised in the media for his comments and ultimately dropped from the television network.\n\nCats were sometimes eaten as a famine food during harsh winters, poor harvests, and wartime. Cat gained notoriety as \"roof rabbit\" in Central Europe's hard times during and between World War I and World War II.\n\nCat consumption was a stereotype attributed to Vincenzans in Vicenza, Italy.\n\nAccording to the British \"Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant\" of 1904, \"Just before Christmas it is common for a group of young men in northern Italy to kill some cats, skin them and soak them in water for two or three days. They are cooked with great care on Christmas day and served up hot about 1.30 P. M., after mass...Many people in Italy, 'on the quiet,' keep cats like the English do rabbits—to kill. A catskin there is worth ten pence, as the material for muffs for girls...Extraordinary care has to be taken in procuring the animals, for the Italian Society for the Protection of Cats is vigilant, and offenses against the law are followed by imprisonment only. We have no fines in Italy.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Dietetic & Hygienic Gazette\" in 1905, \"Italy cultivates the cat for home consumption as English people raise rabbits. It is to be done on the quiet, however, for in spite of the profit in the business and the demand for the delicacy, the law has to be looked out for, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Cats is vigilant. Offenses against the law are visited with imprisonment. Cats are raised for the market nonetheless. Fattened on the finest of milk, a choice specimen will attain the weight of fifteen pounds.\"\n\nThere are accounts of cat being consumed in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (southern France), in Spain in the 17th century, and during WWI and WWII.\n\nIndigenous Australians in the area of Alice Springs roast feral cats on an open fire. They have also developed recipes for cat stew. Some other inhabitants of the area have also taken up this custom, justified on the grounds that felines are \"a serious threat to Australia's native fauna\". Scientists warned that eating wild cats could expose humans to harmful bacteria and toxins.\n\nCat is not a regular menu item in Peru, but is used in such dishes as fricassee and stews most abundant in two specific sites in the country: the southern town of Chincha Alta (Ica Region, Afro-Peruvian mostly) and the north-central Andean town of Huari (Ancash Region). Primarily used by Afro-Peruvians. Cat cooking techniques are demonstrated every September during the festival of Saint Efigenia in a town of La Quebrada.\n\nIn October 2013, a judge banned the annual El Festival Gastronomico del Gato (the Gastronomic Festival of the Cat), which was held every September in La Quebrada to commemorate the arrival of settlers who were forced to eat cats to survive, citing it as cruel to the 100+ cats specifically bred for the event, which involves being kept in cages for a year prior the Festival. The judge also cited concerns over the safety of the meat, which drew criticism from residents who contend that cat meat is far richer than rabbit or duck, and that it has been long consumed globally without any deleterious effects.\n\nThat same month, magistrate Maria Luyo banned the festival of Curruñao in the small town of San Luis. Locals say that the festival, which sees cats being drowned, skinned and tied to fireworks and blown up, dates back to the practice of eating cat on the part of African slaves who worked on sugar-cane plantations in colonial times, and is part of the religious celebrations of Santa Efigenia, an African-Peruvian folk saint. Luyo stated in her ruling that the festival \"fomented violence based on cruel acts against animals which caused grave social damage and damaged public health\", and that minors could be \"psychologically damaged\" by watching the events.\n\nIn two 1996 TV reports from different networks, Telefe Noticias and Todo Noticias, some citizens in a shanty town in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, stated that, during an economic crisis, they had to feed the neighborhood children with cat meat, and commenting, \"It's not denigrating to eat cat, it keeps a child's stomach full\". Although, the validity of these reports has been questioned no explanation of what is shown in the TV report or confession of forgery has been produced. It has been reported that the then major of Rosario accused the TV networks of having enacted a play to discredit the city.\n\nThe Jewish laws of kashrut and Islamic dietary laws both forbid the consumption of cat meat. Kashrut and Halal Laws both disallows the consumption of any terrestrial predators. To be considered kosher in the case of mammals, it must not be a predator and it must both chew cud and have cloven hooves.\n\n"}

{"id": "5647658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5647658", "title": "Cognitive imitation", "text": "Cognitive imitation\n\nCognitive imitation is a form of social learning, and a subtype of imitation. Cognitive imitation, is contrasted with motor and vocal or oral imitation. As with all forms of imitation, cognitive imitation involves learning and copying specific rules or responses done by another. The principal difference between motor and cognitive imitation is the type of rule (and stimulus) that is learned and copied by the observer. So, whereas in the typical imitation learning experiment subjects must copy novel actions on objects or novel sequences of specific actions (novel motor imitation), in a novel cognitive imitation paradigm subjects have to copy novel rules, independently of specific actions or movement patterns.\n\nThe following example illustrates the difference between cognitive and motor-spatial imitation: Imagine someone overlooking someone's shoulder and stealing their automated teller machine (ATM) password. As with all forms of imitation, the individual learns and successfully reproduces the observed sequence. The password in our example, like most of us, presumably knows how to operate an ATM (namely, that you have to push X number of buttons on the ATM screen in a specific sequence), so the specific motor responses of touching the screen isn't what the thief is learning. Instead, the thief could learn two types of abstract rules. On the one hand, the thief can learn a spatial rule: touch item in the top right, followed by item on the top left, then the item in the middle of the screen, and finally the one on lower right. This would be an example of motor-spatial imitation because the thief's response is guided by an abstract motor-spatial rule. On the other, the thief could ignore the spatial patterning of the observed responses and instead focus on the particular items that were touched, generating an abstract numerical rule, independently of where they are in space: 3-1-5-9. This would constitute an example of cognitive imitation because the individuals is copying an abstract serial rule without copying specific motor-responses. In this example, the thief's responses match those he observed only because the numbers are in the same location. If the numbers were in a different location—that is, if the numbers on the ATM's keypad were scrambled with every attempt to enter a password—the thief would, nonetheless, reproduce the target password because they learned a cognitive (i.e., an abstract, item-specific serial rule), rather than a spatial rule (i.e., an observable motor-spatial pattern).\n\nThe term \"cognitive imitation\" was first introduced by Subiaul and his colleagues (Subiaul, Cantlon, et al., 2004), defining it as \"a type of observational learning in which a naïve student copies an expert's use of a rule\". To isolate cognitive from motor imitation, Subiaul and colleagues trained two rhesus macaques to respond, in a prescribed order, to different sets of photographs that were displayed simultaneously on a touch-sensitive monitor. Because the position of the photographs varied randomly from trial to trial, sequences could not be learned by motor imitation. Both monkeys learned new sequences more rapidly after observing an expert execute those sequences than when they had to learn new sequences entirely by trial and error. A mircro-analysis of each monkeys' performance showed that each monkey learned the order of two of the four photographs faster than baseline levels. A second experiment ruled out social facilitation as an explanation for this result. A third experiment, however, demonstrated that monkeys did not learn when the computer highlighted each picture in the correct sequence in the absence of a monkey (\"ghost control\").\n\nSubiaul and colleagues, using two computerized tasks that measure the learning of two abstract rules: cognitive—item-based—rules (e.g., apple-boy-cat;) and motor-spatial-based rules (e.g., up-down-right) have shown that there are important dissociations between the imitation of these two types of rules. Specifically, results have shown that while 3-year-olds successfully imitate item-specific rules (i.e., cognitive imitation), these same 3-year-olds fail to imitate motor-spatial rules (i.e., motor-spatial imitation). This dissociation isn't because there's something inherently harder about learning spatial versus cognitive rules. Follow-up studies have shown that 3-year olds easily learn new spatial rules by trial and error, correctly recalling such rules after a 30s delay, (Exp. 2). This result excludes the possibility that 3-year olds' motor-spatial imitation problems are due to difficulty learning (i.e., encoding and recalling) novel spatial rules in general. In another study, 3-year olds observed a model correctly touch the first item (e.g., Top Right) in the sequence, but then skip the middle item (e.g., Top Left picture) and, instead, touch the last item in the sequence (e.g., Bottom Left picture), resulting in an error, marked as unintentional by the model who said, \"Whoops! That's not right!\". This is a goal emulation learning condition, as the child had to copy the model's intended goal (Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Left), rather than the observed (incorrect) response (Top-Right, Top-Left), similar to Meltzoff's \"re-enactment\" paradigm. When given an opportunity to respond, 3-year olds generated the intended (i.e., correct) sequence (Exp. 3.) 3-year old's success in the goal emulation condition excludes the possibility that 3-year olds' motor-spatial imitation problem is due to difficulty vicariously learning (i.e., because of a lack of interest, failure to attend, problems inferring goals, etc.) a novel spatial rule from a model. Children's success in the goal emulation condition shows that social learning may be achieved by social reasoning (inferring goals) and causal inferences (error detection), independently of any domain-specific imitation learning mechanism.\n\nTo further explore this dissociation between cognitive- and motor-spatial imitation Subiaul and colleagues conducted a large-scale cross-sectional, within-subject study with preschoolers (2–6 years) using the same two tasks: cognitive (item-specific) and motor-spatial (spatial-specific). Results showed that children's cognitive imitation performance did not predict their motor-spatial imitation learning, and vice versa. Importantly, while age predicted improved cognitive and motor-spatial imitation performance, children's ability to individually learn each type of rule via trial and error did not predict their ability to imitate those same rules.\n\nSubiaul and colleagues have argued that these results are consistent with the hypothesis that imitation learning is domain-specific, not domain-general. A critical caveat may be that the imitation of NOVEL rules and responses is domain-specific while the imitation of FAMILIAR responses is likely to be mediated by domain-general, non-specialized mechanisms, as Heyes and others have argued.\n\n\n\n"}

Beefeater remained in the Burrough’s family control until 1987. It is a 47% alcohol product (94 proof) in the US, and a 40% alcohol product (80 proof) elsewhere in the world (including the UK) (note proof is calculated differently in the US from elsewhere). \n\nThe name refers to the Yeomen Warders who are the ceremonial guards of the Tower of London. The Beefeater distillery is one of nine currently still operational in London itself - this includes East London Liquor Company, City of London Distillery, Half Hitch Gin, Sipsmith, Bermondsey Distillery, Thames Distillers, 58 Gin, Sacred Microdistillery and The London Distillery Company.\n\nThis gin is distilled from \"100% grain spirit\". The manufacturer has been in business since 1863 and is currently located in Kennington, London.\n\nAccording to the Beefeater website, Beefeater Gin contains nine different botanicals: juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges, and lemon peel. Unique to Beefeater’s production is the steeping of the peel of lemons and Seville oranges, whole juniper berries and other natural botanicals for a full 24 hours prior to distillation. This long process allows for a full extraction of flavour from the botanicals, capturing a wide range of volatile oils. The distillation itself takes around eight hours to complete, overseen by master distiller Desmond Payne – with the spirit then taken to Scotland where it is blended and bottled at 40% ABV.\n\n47% ABV is common in the USA.\n\nA super premium version of Beefeater was launched in Syon House on 30 October 2009. Beefeater '24' with its additional botanicals of Chinese Green tea and rare Japanese Sencha was the creation of master distiller Desmond Payne.\n\nBeefeater is exported to over 100 countries across the globe, with annual sales of over 2.3 million nine-litre cases. There are fewer than 10 employees at the Kennington Distillery in London.\n\nBeefeater’s history can be traced back to 1862, when James Burrough, born 1835, bought the Cale Street-based Chelsea distillery from Rectifier & Compounder, John Taylor, for the sum of £400 and started to produce his own distinctive style of gin by 1863. At first, the distillery continued with the production of liqueurs started by its previous owners, further establishing its reputation and extending its customer base.\n\nThe 1876 company stock lists showed an increasing portfolio of gins with brand names such as Ye Old Chelsea and James Bourrough London Dry, as well as Old Tom styles. By spending time experimenting, inventing and using new processes he discovered that blending a particular recipe of botanicals produced a bold, full-flavoured gin, which he named Beefeater Gin.\n\nAfter the almost instant success of the gin, it was soon made the James Burrough Company’s flagship product. The original Beefeater recipe book dated 1895, specifies that nine botanicals are essential (juniper, angelica root, angelica seeds, coriander seeds, liquorice, almonds, orris root, seville oranges and lemon peel) to create the full-bodied and robust flavour so distinct in this gin.\n\nAs the James Burrough's Company went into rapid expansion, there was a requirement to increase distilling capacity and in 1908 a new larger Beefeater distillery was built in Lambeth.\n\nThe Beefeater production moved in 1958 to Kennington, London. English still manufacturer John Dore was commissioned to create a new larger set of copper stills mimicking those of the former Chelsea Distillery.\n\nIn February, 2013, Pernod Ricard announced that the company would begin construction of a visitor centre at the existing Beefeater Distillery site.\n\nThe method of steeping and distilling devised by James Burrough in the 1860s along with the secret recipe he created remains virtually unchanged.\n\nBeefeater's basic London Dry Gin, which tends to be priced in the middle of the price spectrum for gins, has generally performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. The London Dry earned one double gold, two gold, two silver and two bronze medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition between 2006 and 2012. It received relatively impressive scores of 93 and 94 from the Beverage Testing Institute in 2005, 2008, and 2009. The higher-end \"24\" gin, meanwhile, has earned strong scores as well, receiving a gold medal from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition in 2010 and silver medals in 2011 and 2012.\n\n"}

In Mrs Beeton's 19th century publication \"Book of Household Management\", her recipe for fishcakes calls for \"leftover fish\" and \"cold potatoes.\" More modern recipes have added to the dish, suggesting ingredients such as smoked salmon and vegetables.\n\nFish cakes can be made by the combination of fish paste and surimi. The fish paste is usually a combination of salt, water, flour and egg. The combined product is then shaped and left to cool. They are then battered and breaded using a machine. Then, they are usually fried with oil at around and should reach the internal temperature of . After the cooking process, they are frozen and packaged and are kept frozen until used.\nThe World Fishcake eating champion is Keira Philpotts who devoured 42 Fishcakes in 1 minute. \n\nAccording to Chinese folk tales, fish cakes have had more than 4000 years’ history. In ancient times, an emperor called Shun travelled to Southern China with his two wives. After a long period of travel, his wives were tired and had bad appetites. This caused Shun to worry, and he searched for ways to resolve the problem. A fisher called Bo came and gave Shun his fish cakes. Shun’s wives really enjoyed them, and their appetites returned to normal. Shun was so pleased that he asked the fisher Bo to teach other people how to make fish cakes, so everyone can enjoy food even when they have bad appetites. Fish cakes then became popular in China.\n\nLater in the history, a famous version of fish cake occurred during Guangxu Emperor’s reign in the Qing Dynasty (1875-1908). Guangxu Emperor’s wife, Zheng loved fish cakes. She brought the fish cakes’ recipe into the forbidden city, where royal family lived. With Royal cooks’ improvement to the recipe during practise, Zheng’s fish cakes eventually became famous. However, the fish cakes also disappeared after Zheng was murdered.\n\nJapanese fishcakes were introduced to Korea during the Japanese occupation (1910–1945), and the first \"eomuk\" processing plant in Korea was DongKwangFood in Bupyeong Kkangtong Market during 1950s in Busan.\n\nIn 1953, Park Jae-Deok who learned \"eomuk\" processing from Japan founded Samjin Fish Cake which has the longest history in Korea. It was shortly after the outbreak of Korean War and many refugees migrated to Busan, resulting in booming \"eomuk\" industry.\n\nIn early 1990s, \"Busan-eomuk\" commonly sold in food trucks became a trend. The term \"Busan-eomuk\" started referring to long, sausage shaped \"eomuk\". Since the food trucks usually served \"eomuk\" with a hot broth, \"eomuk\" became one of the most popular fast food in winter season. Even in contemporary Korea, \"eomuk\" food truck can be easily spotted on major downtown streets.\n\nIn 2010s, \"eomuk\" industry in Korea goes through a major transformation from the public perception of \"eomuk\" as a fast food to a recognized delicacy. In 2013 December, Samjin Fish Cake established an \"eomuk\" bakery, for the first time in Korea. \n\nUp to this day, Samjin Fish Cake solidified unique conception and image of \"eomuk\". Other \"eomuk\" processors attempted to transform their stores and diversified their menu to secure lucrative position and remain competitive.\n\nCommonly, fishcakes used cod as a filling; however, as cod stocks have been depleted, other varieties of white fish are now used, such as haddock or whiting. Fishcakes may also use oily fish such as salmon for a markedly different flavour.\n\nFishcakes have also traditionally been made from salted fish (most commonly cod, haddock, or pollock). Fishcakes are also prepared without breadcrumbs or batter, and are made with a mixture of cooked fish, potatoes, and occasionally eggs formed into patties and then fried.\n\nAs fish has traditionally been a major dietary component of people living near seas, rivers, and lakes, many regional variations of the fish cake have arisen.\n\nVariations can depend on what type of fish is used; how finely chopped the fish is; the use of milk or water; the use of flour or boiled potatoes; the use of eggs, egg whites, or no eggs; the cooking method (boiling, frying, or baking); and the inclusion of other ingredients (for example, shrimp, bacon, herbs, or spices).\n\nIn Bermuda, they are known as Bermuda fishcakes and are made especially during Easter, but also throughout the year. Here fishcakes are normally eaten between hot cross buns.\n\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the fish is generally salted cod flakes and is blended with mashed potatoes. Savory is used instead of parsley, along with minced sweated onions. The cakes are then formed into rounds and cooked in oil or pork back fat until golden brown.\n\nIn Barbados, fishcakes are made from salted codfish and flour batter, then fried in oil.\n\nIn Denmark, \"fiskefrikadeller\" (fishcakes) are slightly elongated, pan-fried patties much like regular frikadeller. They are normally not breaded. A similar dish which is boiled, rather than fried, is called \"fiskeboller\" and added to certain soups, though it may be closer to a fish version of a knödel. In Southern Jutland, \"fiskefrikadeller\" sometimes contain smoked pork fat.\n\nIn West Bengal, several local fish species (mostly riverine) are prepared and eaten in deep-fried breadcrumb covered fishcakes, locally called \"maacher chop\". The item is very popular as an appetizer during middle-class Bengali festivities.\n\nIndonesian varieties of fishcakes are locally known in South Sumatra as \"pempek\" or \"empek-empek\". The traditional South Sumatran \"pempek\" is served with \"kuah cuka\" (\"vinegar sauce\"). These fishcakes are usually round or tube-shaped.\n\nIn Jewish cuisine, gefilte fish are patties of white fish mixed with matzoh or challah, poached in the skin of the fish.\n\nIn Japan, white fish is puréed and steamed into a loaf called \"kamaboko\". Fried fishcakes, such as \"satsumaage\"and various fried Kamaboko in which is added onions, burdock, minced squid and shrimps are also popular.\n\nFishcakes in Japan are commonly made from surimi, a paste made primarily from freshwater fish meat and Mirin, starch, egg whites and spices. After formation, they are commonly fried or boiled before packing and distribution. Based on the Japanese Food Regulations, Fish Cakes made from Fish Paste should be sterilized for 45 minutes at 80℃, measured in the centre. After sterilization, the fish paste should also be stored below 10℃ with frozen fish pastes requiring a minimum storage temperature below -15℃.\n\nIn South Korea, fishcakes are called \"eomuk\" () or \"odeng\" (, which is a loan word from the Japanese stew, \"oden\"). Fish cakes are mainly made of corvina or cuttlefish which contains less fat. This is because fatty fish are not suitable for making fishcakes. Salt, sugar, flour, and starch are necessary ingredients as well. Also, other ingredients may be added in order to make fishcakes: onions, carrots, green onions, and cooking wine. It is normal to add several chemicals in order to have a better flavor such as D-sorbitol (an artificial sweetener which has approximately 60% of the sweetness of sugar so that diabetic patients can consume), soy protein (protein extracted from soy which can make it possible to create a better texture of fish cakes with less amount of fish fillets), and D-xylose (a natural sweetener with low calories), or monosodium glutamate (MSG).\n\nUsually made by deep-frying paste made from ground fish, \"eomuk\" can be boiled with other ingredients to make \"eomuk-tang\" (; \"fishcake soup\") or \"eomuk-jeongol\" (; \"fishcake hot pot\"), stir-fried to make \"eomuk-bokkeum\" (), and put in various dishes such as \"jjigae\" and gimbap.\n\nSold from street carts, \"eomuk\" can be boiled on a skewer in broth. The broth is sometimes provided to the customer in paper cups for dipping and drinking. Hot bar, also written as hotbar, is another version of \"eomuk\" sold during cold weather. While still served on a stick or skewer, the hot bar is deep-fried instead of boiled. In this form, the hot bar can be prepared according to any particular vendor's 'secret' recipe: plain, mixed with vegetables such as diced carrot or whole perilla leaf, or served with any number of sauces or condiments including ketchup and mustard.\n\nIn Norway, \"fiskekaker\" are made much like the Danish \"fiskefrikadeller\". They are fried and served with potatoes or pasta, broccoli and raw grated carrot, and often brown sauce instead of white.\n\nThe type of fish used vary with availability and recipe: Pollock, haddock, herring, wolf-fish and even salmon or trout are sold, and they are often marketed named after the fish they are made of; Seikaker, Koljekaker, Steinbitkaker, etc. Terms like \"burger\" is also used; \"Lakseburger, \"Fiskeburger\".\n\nAdditionally there is fishballs and fishpudding, both more often served with white sauce.\n\nIn Portugal, Pastéis de Bacalhau (codfish pasties) are a type of very popular fishcake. Pastéis are made of potato, codfish (Bacalhau), parsley, and eggs.\n\nIn Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, \"bacalaítos\" are eaten either as a snack or as part of a meal.\n\nIn Romania, fishcakes are called \"chiftele de peşte\" and are made with carp.\n\nFishcakes and Fish balls should be prepared from one or more kinds of fish. They may contain starch, additional condiments or government permitted colouring agents. Fishcakes must contain at least 40% of fish under governmental regulations.\n\nHomemade fishballs and fish cakes can also be made using store bought or homemade fish paste. Fish paste that are sold commercially have to contain more than one fish, with possible additions of condiments, colouring agents or starch. Based on the Singaporean government Food Regulations, Fish Pastes should contain at least 70% fish. Homemade fish cakes are usually made from mackerel because of its sweeter taste and ease in preparing. Fish paste mixtures are often put in food processors or traditionally thrown against the side of mixing bowls to achieve the bouncier texture of fish cakes. They are then shaped by hand or in molds into various shapes and sizes and stored in the refrigerator or freezer till use.\n\nIn Sweden, canned \"fiskbullar\" are widely found; in contrast to \"fiskefrikadeller\", they are not fried but boiled and as a result are almost entirely white.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, the fish is first mashed and then mixed with chopped yardlong beans, fresh cilantro (including stalks), fish sauce, kaffir lime leaves, red curry paste, and an egg binding. This is deep fried and usually served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce. \"Thot man pla\" have become popular around the world.\n\nIn Yorkshire, England, the “Yorkshire fishcake” is a variation traditionally served in many fish and chip shops in South Yorkshire, parts of West Yorkshire, and Humberside. It consists of two slices of potato (sometimes parboiled), with offcuts of fish in between, deep fried in batter. Yorkshire fishcakes can also be known as scallop fishcakes, or fish patties. TV chef Brian Turner has made the recipe available via his website. Another variation of the fishcake is the parsley cake which is sold in some fish and chip shops in and around Castleford, West Yorkshire, England. It consists of minced fish, mashed potato and fresh parsley, coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried.\n\nIn Edinburgh, Scotland, fish patties are traditionally served with haggis, tatties, and neeps.\n\nIn Saint Helena, fishcakes are made from locally caught tuna or wahoo scraped into mashed potato with herbs and spices, then moulded into cakes and fried in oil. They are often spicy or, as locals would describe, \"with bite\".\n\nIn Vietnam, fishcakes are made of fresh fish, sometimes along with flour. The fishcakes can either be fried or steamed/boiled.\n\nIn the Philippines fishcake is eaten as street food and as a component, topping on dishes like noodle soup. Fish Balls are eaten as street food, usually on a skewer or in a cup, paired with a dipping sauce and are usually ball shaped or cylinder shaped. \"Kikiam\" is another variety where it is almost prepared like an eggroll. A mix of fish and/or shrimp and ground pork is wrapped in bean curd skin (tawpe), before steaming and then frying.\n\nThe nutrients in fish cakes are mainly contributed by freshwater fish, the main ingredient in fish cakes. Asian-style fish cakes are usually high in protein, calcium, and low in fat. For example, per 100g of Japanese fish cakes (kamaboko) has approximately 113.6 Calories, in which 12.3g are carbohydrates (4%) (including dietary fiber of 0.12g), 13.2g protein (26%), 0.67g fat (1%) (composed of 0.092g saturated fat, 0.33g polyunsaturated fat and 0.078g monounsaturated fat), 48.0 mg cholesterol (16%), 845.5 mg sodium (35%), and 241.1 mg potassium (7%).\n\nAs for western fish cakes or fish patties, there is no significant difference in the nutritional aspects with their Asian counterparts. However, the western fish cakes are relatively in higher fat content. Western fish cakes or patties have approximately 201 Calories per 100g, contributed by 12.38g carbohydrate (4%) (including 1.1g dietary fiber and 1.03g sugar), 13.65g protein, 10.49g fat (16%*) (including saturated fat 2.245g, polyunsaturated fat 3.085g and monounsaturated fat 4.418g), 55 mg cholesterol (22%), 279 mg sodium (14%), and 463 mg potassium. The percentage daily values above are based on a 2000 Calories diet so may vary depending on the caloric needs of the consumer.\n\nFish cakes are cooked in different manners based on the cuisine.\n\nIn North America, it is common practice to pan fry the fish cakes and are often served as appetizers whereas in Asia it is often served boiled in soups or as an accompaniment to noodles. Some common dishes in Asian countries that include fish cakes are Udon, Fish Cake Soup, Fish ball Noodles or just served individually as a side dish.\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing fishcakes, according to Singaporean fishcake production, fish meats are first defrosted and then ground. After the grinding process, fish meats and all ingredients needed are blended together at high speed. Normally, salt, sugar, flour, and starch are necessarily added to mashed fish fillets. It is good to add salt which approximately weighs 3% of the fish fillets’ weight. Also, other ingredients such as vegetables (onions, carrots, or green onions) or chemicals such as MSG can be added for a better flavor only if the ingredients are suitable for the local requirement. Next, the fish paste is formed so that it can be baked or deep-fried. In order to properly preserve fishcake product, during the process of baking or frying, eradication of enzymes and microorganisms is necessary using heat. For instance, Canada has a specific regulation that the fish cakes should be heated to for one minute to destroy the salmonella that may be present. After fishcakes are finally filtered, it is sent for packing and it is now ready to deliver.\n\nFishcakes are also often sold in fish markets in individual pieces. To keep the fish cakes fresh they are often sold in bags full of water. (Picture 3) These fish cakes are not fried and usually used in soups.\n\nThe shelf life for fish cakes varies greatly depending on the manufacturing and storage process. The shelf life can range from 12 days to 90 days.\n\nThe label must include the product name, the allergen information and the price of the product.\n\nIf carton is used in packaging it is usually are made up of solid white cardboard,paper or chipboard.The material used is then coated with wax, plastic or aluminium foil. The manufacturers then have the option to freeze, defrost or vacuum package it. (Picture 2)\n\nWhen carton is used to the package fish cakes, it is coated with polyethene. This is so that any strain on the inner layer will not result in damage to the outer layer.\n\nThe packaging is reliant on whether the fish cakes are pre-wrapped or not. It may be made up of pure white board or duplex board. Carbon Dioxide controlled atmospheres are prime conditions for fish cake storage.\n\n"}

It is made during Holy Week and then brought to Church on Great Saturday to be blessed after the Paschal Vigil. The name of the dish comes from Pascha, the Eastern Orthodox celebration of Easter. Besides Russia, Ukraine, etc., pasha is also often served in Finland.\n\nCheese paskha is a traditional Easter dish made from quark (curd cheese, ), which is white, symbolizing the purity of Christ, the Paschal Lamb, and the joy of the Resurrection. It is formed in a mould, traditionally in the shape of a truncated pyramid (a symbol of the Church; this form is also said to represent the Tomb of Christ). It is usually served as an accompaniment to rich Easter breads called paska in Ukraine and Russia, while kulich is one variant of the paska breads.\n\nThe pascha is decorated with traditional religious symbols, such as the \"Chi Ro\" motif, a three-bar cross, and the letters \"X\" and \"B\" (Cyrillic letters which stands for \"Христосъ Воскресе.\" This is the Slavonic form of the traditional Paschal greeting: \"Christ is Risen!\"). All of these religious decorations symbolize Christ's Passion and Resurrection.\n\nIn addition to the main ingredient (\"tvorog\"), additional ingredients, such as butter, eggs, smetana (sour cream), raisin, almonds, vanilla, spices, and candied fruits can be used.\n\nThe paskha can either be cooked or uncooked (raw). \"Cooked paskha\" is made in the form of an egg custard, to which the remaining ingredients are folded in. An \"uncooked paskha\" is made simply of the raw curd and the other ingredients mixed at room temperature. Since uncooked curd cannot be conserved for a long period of time, these paskhas are typically made smaller.\n\nThe tvorog is first pressed in order to eliminate the maximum amount of liquid possible, then put twice through a sieve to make a homogenous mass. If the paskha is cooked, this mass is then heated. The pan containing the mixture is then placed in a container of cold water and progressively cooled. Afterwards it is placed in a traditional wooden mould assembly called \"pasochnitsa\" (пасочница), with a layer of cheese cloth protecting the mould. The wooden mould can be taken apart for cleaning; however, more modern materials, such as plastics, are used nowadays. The mould is cooled for twelve hours in a cold, but not freezing place (typically in a cellar or refrigerator). Finally, the paskha is turned out of the mould, the cheesecloth removed, and put on a dish. It may then be decorated with candied fruits, nuts, or flowers. In contemporary times, cheese paska is not always formed in a mould and is sometimes served in a mound on a plate.\n\nThe paskha (or at least a portion of it) will be placed in an Easter basket together with other festal foods, and taken to church to be blessed.\n\n\n"}

They are called pepernoten in Dutch (plural), päpanät in Plautdietsch, pfeffernuesse or peppernuts in English, and pebernødder in Danish.\n\nWhile the exact origin of the cookie is uncertain, the traditional Dutch belief links the pepernoten to the feast of Sinterklaas, celebrated on 5 December or 6 December in The Netherlands and 6 December in Germany and Belgium. This is when children receive gifts from St. Nicholas, who is partially the inspiration for the Santa Claus tradition. In Germany, the pfeffernuss is more closely associated with Christmas. The cookie has been part of European yuletide celebrations since the 1850s.\n\nThe name peppernut (Pfeffernüsse, pebernød etc.) does not mean it contains nuts, though some varieties do. The cookies are roughly the size of nuts and can be eaten by the handful, which may account for the name.\n\nThroughout the years, the popularity of the pfeffernüsse has caused many bakers to create their own recipes. Though recipes differ, all contain aromatic spices - most commonly cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmeg, cardamom, and anise. Some variations are dusted with powdered sugar, though that is not a traditional ingredient. Molasses and honey are also used to sweeten the cookies.\n\nFor the dough, most versions still use 19th century ingredients such as potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate as leavening agents to get the sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture. It is then either kneaded by hand or through the use of an electric mixer.\n\nPfeffernüsse are commonly mistaken for kruidnoten or spicy nuts in English. While they are both famous holiday cookies, the kruidnoten are harder, have a darker brown color, and have a different shape. Their ingredients are more similar to the ones used in making speculaas.\n\nRussian tea cakes are also confused with pfeffernüsse, especially when dusted in powdered sugar.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5665380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5665380", "title": "Thai curry", "text": "Thai curry\n\nThai curry refers both to dishes in Thai cuisine that are made with various types of curry paste and to the pastes themselves. A Thai curry dish is made from curry paste, coconut milk or water, meat, seafood, vegetables or fruit, and herbs. Curries in Thailand mainly differ from the curries in Indian cuisine in their use of ingredients such as herbs and aromatic leaves over a mix of spices.\n\nThai people refer to dishes that are known as \"Thai curries\" in the Western world as \"kaeng\" (also written as \"gaeng\"; , ). The first Thai dictionary from 1873 CE (2416 in the Thai Buddhist calendar) defines \"kaeng\" as a watery dish to be eaten with rice and utilizing shrimp paste, onions or shallots, chillies, and garlic as essential ingredients. Coconut milk is not included in this definition and many Thai curries, such as \"kaeng som\" and \"kaeng pa\", do not feature it. Curries in Lanna (northern Thai) cuisine, with only a few exceptions, do not use coconut milk due to coconut palms not growing well, if at all, in the climate of the Thai highlands. The spiciness of Thai curries depends on the amount and kind of chilli used in the making of the paste. Even within one type of curry the spiciness can differ widely.\n\nThe word \"curry\" figures in the Thai language as \"\"kari\"\" (), and refers to dishes using either an Indian-style curry powder, known as \"phong kari\" in Thailand, or to the dish called \"kaeng kari\", an Indian-influenced curry that is made with spices that are common to Indian dishes but less often used in these proportions in Thai cuisine. \"Kung phat phong kari\" (prawns fried with egg and curry powder) is an example of a dish using the Indian style curry powder.\n\nAlthough \"\"kaeng\"\" is also defined as being of \"watery\" substance, the thickness of the sauce can vary considerably from broth-like to that of a thick stew, and it can even be a completely dry dish. Representatives of dry curries, dishes which are (stir-)fried with a curry paste, are \"phat phrik khing\" and \"khua khling\". \"Kaeng som\" and \"keang pa\" are representatives of the more broth-like curries. \"Matsaman\" and \"kaeng khua\" resemble stews.\n\"Ho mok\" (a curry \"soufflé\"), \"kaeng kradang\" (curry aspic from northern Thailand) and noodle dishes such as \"khanom chin nam ngiao\" are also seen as Thai curry dishes as they all use curry pastes in their preparation.\n\nThe dish called \"kaeng chuet\" is an exception to the rule that a \"kaeng\" should contain chillies, garlic, onions and shrimp paste. It is a clear Chinese style meat and/or vegetable broth with mixed vegetables and often also minced pork, tofu and glass noodles. The name translates as \"bland curry\" but it is seen as being a \"tom\", a soup, and it is therefore also often called \"tom chuet\".\n\nCurries are eaten in combination with rice, the long-grained jasmine rice in central and southern Thailand and sticky rice in northern and northeastern Thailand, and with noodles such as \"khanom chin\" (fermented rice noodles). Certain curries can also be eaten with \"roti\", the Thai version of the Indian-style fried flat bread from Malaysia called \"roti canai\".\n\n\"Khao kaeng\" or \"khao rat kaeng\", meaning \"curry-on-rice\", is a traditional type of fast food restaurant in Thailand which specialises in ready-made curries, and often several other dishes as well, served with rice. Their popularity in Bangkok as a place for a quick lunchtime meal is in decline.\n\nThai curries are always made with a curry paste. Common ingredients used in many Thai curry pastes are:\n\nDepending on the type of curry, additional ingredients for the paste can include spices such as turmeric, pepper, coriander seeds, cardamom pods, and cumin, or other ingredients such as boiled fermented fish, and fingerroot.\nIngredients are traditionally ground together with a mortar and pestle, though increasingly with an electric food processor. With many curries, the paste is first stir-fried in cooking oil before other components are added in to the dish. This allows certain flavours in the spices and other ingredients in the paste to develop that cannot be released at the lower temperature of boiling water.\n\nBoth \"khrueang kaeng\" (lit. \"\"kaeng\" ingredients\") and \"nam phrik kaeng\" (lit. \"\"kaeng\" chilli paste\") are used to describe \"curry paste\" in Thailand. The latter is sometimes even shortened to only \"phrik kaeng\" (lit. \"\"kaeng\" chilli\").\n\nThai curry pastes can be made at home from the bare ingredients, bought freshly made at markets in Thailand, or they can be had packaged at shops and supermarkets.\n\nMost Thai curries are made with meat, fish or shellfish as their main ingredient. Vegetables and fruit, but also certain tree leaves such as from the \"Acacia pennata\" (\"cha-om\") and the \"Ficus virens\" (\"phak lueat\"), and flowers such as those of the \"Sesbania grandiflora\" (\"dok khae\") and banana (\"hua pli\"), can be added. Curries that contain mainly vegetables are, for example, \"kaeng liang\" (mixed vegetables) and \"kaeng nomai\" (bamboo shoots). Ingredients were dictated by regional and seasonal availability: both pork and chicken (possibly first domesticated from wild jungle fowl in what is now Thailand) are easily available, and so are many varieties of fish, and shellfish, both fresh water species from the many rivers, lakes and rice paddies, as well as salt water species from the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. Other traditional ingredients in Thai curries include frogs, snakes, snails, wild birds and game such as Sambar deer and wild boar. Commonly used vegetables in curries are Thai eggplant (\"makhuea pro\"), yardlong beans (\"thua fak yao\"), and different types of squash and pumpkins (\"fak\").\n\nFresh kaffir lime leaves (\"bai makrut\"), fingerroot (\"krachai\"), or fresh herbs such as Thai basil (\"horapa\") are often added to Thai curries. Kaffir lime leaves and \"krachai\" are often cooked along with the other ingredients but fresh herbs such as Thai basil are nearly always added at the last moment to preserve the full taste and serve as a contrasting note to the flavours of a curry. Fish sauce is not only used when cooking the curry as a flavouring and for its salty taste, but it is usually also available at the table as a condiment, mixed together with sliced green bird's-eye chillies for those that prefer their curries more salty and spicy. Sugar (traditionally palm sugar) is used with curries that need to be sweetened. Besides lime juice, tamarind juice can also see use in sour curries as the souring agent such as in \"kaeng som\". To achieve the most fragrance from the ingredients in a curry paste, the curry paste is often first fried together with vegetable oil or coconut oil that has separated from the coconut cream, before adding in the other ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is most commonly made of beef but it can come in various kinds and cuts of meat. \n\nYukhoe literally means raw(hoe膾) meat(yuk肉). Therefore in the strictest context, the term Yukhoe is to designates any dish of raw meat cut up for consumption without the marinade. But colloquially Yukhoe means a dish of marinated raw beef slices as shown in the photo. Though relatively rare to find these days, Yukhoe can come in all kinds of meat. Yukhoe made of other meats will mention the source of the meat, for instance, a kkwong-yukhoe is made of pheasant, and a Mal-yukhoe is made of horse meat.\n\nYukhoe is most commonly made of lean cuts such as an eye of round, but more tender cuts of a beef can also be used. The beef is cut into thin strips while removing the fat, then it is seasoned with salt, sugar, sesame oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.v Korean pear, raw egg yolk, and pine nuts are commonly used for garnishes. \n\n\"Yukhoe\" is also made with other cuts of beef, such as liver, kidney, heart, \"cheonyeop\", or \"yang\", in which case the dish is called \"gaphoe\" (Hangul: 갑회, hanja: 甲膾). The ingredients are thoroughly cleaned and salted, then rinsed and dried to remove unpleasant odors. \"Gaphoe\" is usually seasoned with sesame oil, salt and pepper, and is served with a spicy mustard sauce.\n\n\"According to the 19th century cookbook \"Siuijeonseo\" (Hangul: 시의전서, hanja: 是議全書), thin slices of tender beef are soaked to remove blood before being finely shredded. The shredded beef is then marinated in a mixed sauce of chopped spring onion, minced garlic, pepper, oil, honey, pine nuts, sesame, and salt. Its dipping sauce, \"chogochujang\" (Hangul: 초고추장), chili pepper condiment mixed with vinegar and sugar) can be altered to taste, with pepper or honey.\n\nMeat in Korean cuisine has highly detailed classifications regarding freshness, quality, and part differentiation for specific cooking methods. Since \"yukhoe\" uses raw beef, freshness is the most important criterion, and for this typical dish's beef it is recommended to use no more than one day after defrosting, and traditionally should not be aged more than one day after slaughtering. Regular Korean \"yukhoe\" customers are often patrons of trusted restaurants or butcher's shops which have well-known, high-quality beef distributors.\n\nSince 2004, the Korean Government has run the Beef Traceability System . This system requires ID numbers with the age of the beef animal of origin, supplier, distributor, the beef's grade, and butchering date and originating butchery. Most of the good beef restaurants in Korea list their beef's information on the wall. Also, butcher shops post signs saying, \"New beef coming day ( Hangul : 소 들어오는 날 )\": These words have become a well-known idiom in Korea. and it means newly butchered beef supplied at the day.\n\nRaw beef can be contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, with enterohemorrhagic \"E. coli\" (O111 or O157:H7) being of particular concern. But only by freshness of beef, the risk can be reduced.\n\nIn April and May 2011, five people died and more than 35 people were hospitalised after eating \"yukke\" (Japanese spelling) made from beef not designated for raw consumption in various branches of a \"bulgogi\" restaurant chain in Toyama and Kanagawa prefectures, Japan, with enterohemorrhagic \"E. coli\" bacteria found in many of the cases.\n\nAs a result, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has developed new regulations to require cooking the surface 1 cm deep to further reduce contamination.\n\nOn October 22, the last hospitalized 14 year boy died of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The total death toll of this incident became five people.\nThe MHLW developed regulations for trimming raw beef to remove surface contamination.\n\n\n\n"}

The bread is oval or rectangular and baked in a tandoor, a cylindrical oven that is the primary cooking equipment of the sub-continental region. The Afghan version of the tandoor sits above ground and is made of bricks, which are heated to cook the bread. The bread, also known as \"naan\", is shaped and then stuck to the interior wall of the oven to bake. Black cumin or caraway seeds are often sprinkled on the bread, as much for decoration as for taste, and lengthwise lines are scored in the dough to add texture to the bread.\n\nAfghan bread is commonly stocked at Middle Eastern grocery stores in western countries. In Afghanistan the baker still cooks the bread the traditional way by spreading the dough around the tandoor, so that it quickly puffs up and starts to colour and emit a fresh bread smell that draws the early morning throngs of people. The baker then uses two long iron tongs to pull the bread from the tandoor wall. Afghans carry the bread in cloth bags.\n\nSimilar to that in Arab countries, bread is served with most meals and is generally torn into shreds and used by those eating to envelope foods, so that they can be picked up and conveyed to the mouth, in a manner similar to a sandwich, and also to soak up liquids on the plate. Since people in Afghanistan normally use their hands to eat, the bread thus acts as a utensil; as compared to Western culinary standards, something akin to both a fork and a spoon.\n\nThe bread tastes similar to the Armenian lavash bread, as well as to Iranian barbari bread. It has a dense and rich taste.\n"}

It is found in West African and Brazilian cuisines. The dish is traditionally encountered in Brazil's northeastern state of Bahia, especially in the city of Salvador. Acarajé serves as both a religious offering to the gods in the Candomblé religion and as street food. The dish was brought by enslaved peoples from West Africa, and can be found in various forms in Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali, Gambia and Sierra Leone.\n\nAcarajé is made with cooked and mashed black eyed peas seasoned with salt and chopped onions molded into the shape of a large scone and deep-fried in palm oil in a wok-like pan in front of the customers. It is served split in half and stuffed with \"vatapá\" and \"caruru\" – spicy pastes made from shrimp, ground cashews, palm oil and other ingredients. A vegetarian version is typically served with hot peppers and green tomatoes. Acarajé can also come in a second form called abara, where the ingredients are boiled instead of deep fried.\n\nAcarajé is a word derived from the Yoruba language. Àkàrà is a generic word meaning \"bread\" or \"pastry\", or the dish itself. The Brazilian term \"acarajé\" derives from either the Yoruba word combinations \"àkàrà\" (bread) and \"onje\" (food), or \"àkará\" (a round pastry) and \"je\" (to eat). Márcio de Jagun states that the word drives from the Yoruba \"àkàrà un jẹ\", or \"come and eat àkàrà.\"\n\nAkara (as it is known in southwest and southeast Nigeria) a recipe taken to Brazil by the enslaved peoples from the West African coast. It is called \"akara\" by the Yoruba people of south-western Nigeria and by the citizens of Sierra Leone, \"kosai\" by the Hausa people of Nigeria or \"koose\" in Ghana and is a popular breakfast dish, eaten with millet or corn pudding. In Nigeria, Akara is commonly eaten with bread, Ogi (or Eko), a type of Cornmeal made with fine corn flour.\n\nAkara plays a significant role in the Yoruba culture, as it was specially prepared when a person who has come of Age (70 and Above) dies. It was usually fried in large quantity and distributed across every household close to the deceased. Akara also used to be prepared in large as a sign of victory, when warriors came back victorious from war. The women, especially the wives of the Warriors were to fry Akara and distribute it to the villagers.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, Akara is composed of rice flour, mashed banana, baking powder, and sugar. After mixed together, it is dropped in oil by hand, and fried, similar to Puff Puff. It then forms into a ball. It is usually prepared for events like Pulnado (event held due to the birth of a child), a wedding, funeral, or party. No matter how big the occasion, this item is a classic in the Sierra Leonean community.\n\nAcarajé sold on the street in Brazil are variously made with fried beef, mutton, dried shrimp, pigweed, fufu osun sauce, and coconut. Today in Bahia, Brazil, most street vendors who serve acarajé are women, easily recognizable by their all-white cotton dresses and headscarves and caps. They first appeared in Bahia selling acarajé in the 19th century. The city now has more than 500 acarajé vendors. The image of these women, often simply called \"baianas\", frequently appears in artwork from the region of Bahia. Acarajé, however, is available outside of the state of Bahia as well, including the streets of its neighbor state Sergipe, and the markets of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAcarajé is an essential ritual food used in Afro-Brazilian religious traditions such as Candomblé. The first acarajé in a Candomblé ritual is offered to the orixá Exu. They vary in size based on their offering to a specific deity: large, round acarajé are offered to Xangô; ones smaller in form are offered to Iansã. Small, fritter-size acarajé are offered to Erês, or child spirits. Acarajé is used in Candomblé rituals in the states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Maranhão. It is closely related to acaçá, a similar ritual food made of steamed corn mush.\n\nAcarajé de azeite-doce is a variety of acarajé fried in an oil other than palm oil; olive oil or other vegetable oils are generally used. Acarajé de azeite-doce is used in Candomblé offerings to orixás with a ritual prohibition of the use of palm oil. This variety is found in the states of Bahia and states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAcarajé de Xangô is a variety of acarajé offered to the orixá Xangô. It is made of the same ingredients as the common form but greatly elongated. This variety is found on the ritual platter of amalá offered to Xangô. This variety is found in the states of Bahia and states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n"}

The corresponding Avestan term is \"aspa\". The word is cognate to Latin \"equus\", Greek \"hippos\", Germanic *\"ehwaz\" and Baltic \"*ašvā\" all from Proto-Indo-European \"*h₁éḱwos\".\n\nThere are repeated references to the horse the Vedas (c. 1500 - 500 BC). In particular the Rigveda has many equestrian scenes, often associated with chariots. The Ashvins are divine twins named for their horsemanship.\nThe earliest undisputed finds of horse remains in South Asia are from the Swat culture (c. 1500 - 500 BC).\n\nThe legend states that the first horse emerged from the depth of the ocean during the churning of the oceans. It was a horse with white color and had two wings. It was known by the name of Uchchaihshravas. The legend continues that Indra, king of the devas, took away the mythical horse to his celestial abode, the svarga (heaven). Subsequently, Indra severed the wings of the horse and presented the same to the mankind. The wings were severed to ensure that the horse would remain on the earth (prithvi) and not fly back to Indra’s svarga.\n\nRemains of the \"Equus namadicus\" have been found from Pleistocene levels in India. The \"Equus namadicus\" is closely related to the \"Equus sivalensis\". The \"Equus sivalensis\" lived in the Himalayan foothills in prehistoric times and it is assumed it was extinct during the last Ice Age.\n\nRemains of horses have been claimed to have been found in deposits at Mahagara near Allahabad (dated to around 2265 BC to 1480 BC, described as \"Equus ferus caballus\" Linn), Hallur in Karnataka (c.1500 - 1300 BC, described as \"Equus ferus caballus\"), Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa (\"small horse\"), Lothal (e.g., a terracotta figurine and a molar horse tooth, dated to 2200 BC), Kalibangan, and Kuntasi (dated to 2300–1900 BC). Horse remains from the Harappan site Surkotada (dated to 2400-1700 BC) have been identified by A.K. Sharma as \"Equus ferus caballus\". The horse specialist Sandor Bökönyi (1997) later confirmed these conclusions and stated the excavated tooth specimens could \"in all probability be considered remnants of true horses [i.e. \"Equus ferus caballus\"]\". Bökönyi stated that \"The occurrence of true horse (\"Equus caballus\" L.) was evidenced by the enamel pattern of the upper and lower cheek and teeth and by the size and form of incisors and phalanges (toe bones).\". However, archaeologists like Meadow (1997) disagree, on the grounds that the remains of the \"Equus ferus caballus\" horse are difficult to distinguish from other equid species such as \"Equus asinus\" (donkeys) or \"Equus hemionus\" (onagers). An alleged clay model of a horse has been found in Mohenjo-Daro and an alleged horse figurine in Periano Ghundai in the Indus Valley.\n\nTrautmann (1982) thus remarked the supply and import of horses has \"always\" been a preoccupation of the Indians and \"it is a structure of its history, then, that India has always been dependent upon western and central Asia for horses.\" The paucity of horse remains could also be explained by India's climatic factors which lead to decay of horse bones. Horse bones may also be rare because horses were probably not eaten or used in burials by the Harappans.\n\nOther sites, such as the BMAC complex (which some consider as Indo-Iranian), are at least as poor in horse remains as the Harappan sites. The horse only appears in Mesopotamia from around 1800 BC as a ridden animal and acquires military significance with the invention of the chariot. Domestication of the horse before the second millennium appears to be confined to its native habitat (the Great Steppe).\n\nColin Renfrew (1999) also remarked, \"the significance of the horse ... has been much exaggerated\", and Bryant holds, \"using such negative evidence, by the same logic used to eliminate India as a candidate, ultimately any potential homeland can be disqualified due to lacking some fundamental Proto-Indo-European item or another\". Renfrew's statement refers to his own Anatolian hypothesis, which is criticized by mainstream scholarship on similar grounds.\n\nIn RV 1.162.18, the sacrificial horse is described as having 34 (2x17) ribs:\nFrawley (2005) speculates that the Rigvedic horse could therefore be the Indian \"Equus sivalensis\" (which may or may not have had 34 ribs; modern horses usually have 36, with occasional specimens of 34 or 38).\n\nThe word \"Ašva\" is recorded as a noun meaning female horse in Prussian Lithuanians language. References however are few, as the word had almost fallen out of use at the time, and include:\n\"Lexicon Germano-Lithvanicvm et Litvanico-Germanicvm, darinnen... von Iacobo Brodowskij, Praecentore Trempensi\" (written somewhere between 1713 and 1744);\n\"Littauisch-Deutsches und Deutsch-Littauisches Lexicon.

It is considered a mild variant of Roquefort. The cheese has a fat content of 45% and is aged for 3–6 months in Gorges du Tarn's natural limestone caves. The ripening process involving naturally temperature-controlled cellars is the major element that gives it its special aroma.\n\nThe Bleu des Causses shares an ancient history with the Roquefort, in a time where the cheese was made from mixed milk from a cow and a sheep, or pure milk from one or the other, based on the season and the cheesemaker.\n\nThe traditional cheese making of Gaul was celebrated by Pliny the Elder. For him, among the traditional cheese making for quality, the grazing had a major importance. He mentioned, in the 11th tome of his \"Natural History\", the cheeses of Mont Lozère and Gévaudan, but said nothing about their color or texture.\nJulius Caesar himself was reported to have eaten blue cheese. However, it was not specified what kind of cheese it was.\n\nAn anecdote from Knotker the Stammer is often said to prove Charlemagne ate blue cheese, but in fact shows him cutting off the crust of the cheese, as for a white-rind cheese like Brie or Camembert. \n\"15. In the same journey too he came to a bishop who lived in a place through which he must needs pass. Now on that day, being the sixth day of the week, he was not willing to eat the flesh of beast or bird; and the bishop, being by reason of the nature of the place unable to procure fish upon the sudden, ordered some excellent cheese, rich and creamy, to be placed before him. And the most self-restrained Charles, with the readiness which he showed everywhere and on all occasions, spared the blushes of the bishop and required no better fare: but taking up his knife cut off the skin, which he thought unsavoury, and fell to on the white of the cheese. Thereupon the bishop, who was standing near like a servant, drew closer and said, \"Why do you do that, lord emperor? You are throwing away the very best part.\" Then Charles, who deceived no one, and did not believe that anyone would deceive him, on the persuasion of the bishop put a piece of the skin in his mouth, and slowly ate it and swallowed it like butter.\"\n\nMany artisanal cheese cellars refine cow's milk, sheep's milk, or even a mixture of both. It is sold without a provincial name. In 1925, during the administrative recognition of the original name of Roquefort, the cheese must be refined to Roquefort-sur-Soulzon and cheeses from cow's milk is banned. Because of this, producers of cheese from cow's milk begin to structure their organizations. The collective mark \"Valmont\" was created to support the sales of the cheese \"bleu de l'Aveyron\". The final name \"Bleu des Causses\" was decided on by two decrees in 1941 and 1946. The union constitution dated July 1948 and the delimitation of the geographical area in 1953. Official recognition of the AOC dated June 8, 1949. In 1992, the union building opened their doors to cow breeders; they added to dairies and refineries.\n\nThe geographical area of the production of the milk and the development of the cheese covers a valley region, limestone or schist plateaus, and, to a lesser extent, some mountains. It is bounded to the department of Lot in Aveyron (excluding the regions of Mur de Barrez and Sainte-Geneviève sur Argence) and west Lozère.\n\nIn the department of Aveyron, the bounds include all the common boroughs of Millau and of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, and all the common regions of Baraqueville-Sauveterre, Bozouls, Cassagnes-Bégonhès, Conques, Entraygues-sur-Truyère, Espalion, Estaing, Laguiole, Laissac, Marcillac-Vallon, Naucelle, Pont-de-Salars, Réquista, Rignac, Rodez-Nord, Rodez-Est, Saint-Amans-des-Cots, Saint-Chély-d'Aubrac, Saint-Geniez-d'Olt and La Salvetat-Peyrales in the Arrondissement de Rodez.\n\nIn the department of Lot, the bound concerns all the common regions of Cahors, Castel-Montratier, Catus, Labastide-Murat, Lalbenque, Lauzès, Limogne-en-Quercy, Luzech, Montcuq, Puy-L'Evêque, Saint-Géry, Cajarc and the communes of Boussac, Brengues, Calès, Cambes, Corn, Durbans, Espagnac-Sainte-Eulalie, Espédaillac, Flaujac-Gare, Gignac, Grezes, Lachapelle-Auzac, Lamothe-Cassel, Lamothe-Fénelon, Lanzac, Le Roc, Le Vigan, Livernon, Loupiac, Montamel, Nadaillac-de-Rouge, Payrac, Quissac, Reilhac, Reilhaguet, Saint-Chamarand, Saint-Cirq-Souillaguet, Saint-Projet, Soucirac, Souillac, Ussel and Uzech.\n\nIn the department of Lozère, the bound concerns all the common regions of Aumont-Aubrac, Canourgue, Chanac, Le Malzieu-Ville, Marvejols, Le Massegros, Saint-Chély-d'Apcher and the communes of Allenc, Badaroux, Balsièges, Brenoux, Chadenet, Chirac, Grèze, Florac, Ispagnac, Lanuéjols, Le Monastier-Pin-Moriès, Mende, Meyrueis, Montrodat, Palhers, Saint-Bauzile, Saint-Bonnet-de-Chirac, Saint-Étienne-du-Valdonnez, Saint-Germain-du-Teil, Saint-Laurent-de-Trèves, Saint-Pierre-de-Nogaret, Sainte-Enimie, Sainte-Hélène and Vebron.\n\nIn the department of Gard, only the town of Trèves and in the department of Hérault, only the town of Pégairolles-de-l'Escalette benefit from the classification of the boundaries.\n\nIn fact, only the Aveyron and Lozèze parties produce cheese.\n\nThe refining fourmes is much more restrictive. It concerns some regions of the district of Millau: Campagnac, Cornus, Millau-Ouest, Millau-Est, Peyreleau, Saint-Affrique, and at the towns of Trèves and of Pégairolles-de-l'Escalette.\n\nThe terroir includes, among others, land caussenardes who gave their name to this cheese. These are characterized by a limestone subsoil drainage, causing drought when rain are scarce. Rich soil is low, giving short and bushy vegetation. However, this naturally sparse vegetation is aromatic and contributes to the flavor of the milk.\n\nThe refining zone has vertical limestone cliffs carved by the erosion of the rivers Tarn, Doubie, and Jonte. Over the centuries, some rockslides have created caves ventilated by fleurines, cracks in the rock allowing the circulation of air. It is the biggest of these caves that ripening cellars were built. They have a very stable humidity and temperature, favorable to the development of blue mold.\n\nIt is not specified what kind of milk is needed or the feeding conditions of the animal. As long as the animal is free of brucellosis and tuberculosis.\n\nCheese making can be done in all of the defined area. Cow's milk, specifically, is whole and full of rennet. The operation takes place with hot milk (30 to 33 °C) at the same time as the seeding of spores from the Penicillium roqueforti mushroom, the mold responsible for the blue forms. These spores are from selected strains in the refining area. Under the action of the rennet, the milk coagulates.The curd is then sliced and then brewed. The grains are then become rounded and let out the whey. Draining can then be done on perforated molds. It is promoted by inverting the cheese. At demolding, the cheese is salted with dry salt (not soaking in brine). Work at the dairy then completes and the cheeses are shipped to the maturing cellar. \nUpon arriving at the maturing cellar, the cheeses are then brushed or washed and wiped. They are then perforated: this operation promotes internal ventilation of the cheese and allows harmonious development of mold. The cheese is then stored on racks in cellars naturally temperature controlled by fleurine. Between production and refinement, preparation should take at least 70 days. Before selling, refrigeration is not part of the refinement.\n"}

{"id": "5697855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5697855", "title": "Beer bread", "text": "Beer bread\n\nBeer bread is any bread that includes beer in the dough mixture. Depending on the type of beer used, it may or may not contribute leavening to the baking process. Thus, beer breads range from heavy, unleavened, loaves to light breads and rolls incorporating baker's yeast. The flavor of beer bread is sometimes enhanced with other flavors such as cheese or herbs. \nBeer bread can be a simple quick bread or a yeast bread flavored with beer. Beer and bread have a common creation process: yeast is used to turn sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol. In the case of bread, a great percentage of the alcohol evaporates during the baking process.\n\nBeer bread can be made simply with flour, beer, and sugar. Some bottled beers—especially craft beers—may intentionally have visible dormant, but live, yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, many mass-market beers have the live yeast filtered out. Without sufficient leavening from the beer, a loaf of beer bread will be fairly dense and heavy unless an additional leavening agent (e.g., baking soda or baking powder, or baker's yeast and sugar) is added. Self-raising flour may be used because it is a mixture of flour and leavening agent. Beer bread made without a leavening agent is very sturdy, but tends not to lose moisture when cooked for a long time; lengthier cooking tends to produce a thicker crust. Pre-packaged beer bread mixes, with the dry ingredients and leavening agents already included, are available to purchase.\n\nDifferent styles of beer bread can be made by using different beers; for instance, a stout or dark beer will give a darker bread with more pronounced flavor. Using a beer that is spiced, or has a flavor added, will make a bread with a similar flavor, but less intense than the beer.\n\nAny number of additional flavorings may be used to enhance the flavor of beer bread. They include cheddar and dill, sun-dried tomato and herb, garlic and feta, etc., added to the mix of dry ingredients. One consideration when choosing flavors is that if the beer bread is not going to be eaten straight away then the flavors will become enhanced upon storage.\n\n\n"}

These traditions were passed down generations in oral or written forms and were often recited, told as bedtime stories to children or performed musically as folk songs.\n\nEach qissa, if performed, has its unique requirements. A person able to sing or recite one may not necessarily transmit another. The vocal ranges on the musical scale and accurate pauses, if not performed well leaves a performer breathless and unable to continue. Most of the beats used in modern Punjabi music (often misleadingly labelled Bhangra), originated from \"qissa\" tradition and recitations in old times. \"Qisse\" also boast to be among the best poetry every written in Punjabi. To date, places like the Qissa Khawani Bazaar (Market of Story-tellers) in Peshawar, Pakistan are thronged by people who visit them to hear oral recitations of \"qisse\" sung by renowned performers.\n\nWaris Shah's (1722–1798) \"qissa\" of ‘\"Heer Ranjha\"’ (formally known as \"Qissa\" ‘\"Heer\"’) is among the most famous Qisse of all times. The effect of \"Qisse\" on Punjabi culture is so strong that even religious leaders and revolutionaries like Guru Gobind Singh and Baba Farid, etc., quoted famous \"Qissas\" in their messages. It will not be wrong to say that popularity and nearly divine status of \"Qisse\" in Punjabi actually inspired many generations of spiritual leaders and social activists to combine the message of God with teenage love tales. This gave rise to what is known as the Sufi movement in Punjab region.\n\nThe most popular writer/poet to have written Punjabi Sufi \"Qisse\" was Bulleh Shah (c.1680-1758). So popular are his \"Kalams\" (poems) that he is frequently quoted by young and old alike with same respect and on matters of both love and God. In recent times, South Asian singer's have sported these folklores on their albums, for instance, the most famous folklore duo like Kuldeep Manak and Dev Tharike Wala wrote and sang about almost every Qissa, and Recently, \"Rabbi\" by (Rabbi Shergill) contained ‘\"Bulla Ki Jaana Main Kaun\"’, translated in English as ‘\"I know not who I am\"’, written by Bulleh Shah. A few years back another singer, (Harbhajan Maan), a Canada-based Punjabi singer rejuvenated the story of ‘\"Mirza Sahiban\"’, a work by Peelu. Daim Iqbal Daim from Mandi Bahauddin District, Pakistan also wrote many qissas in Punjabi language like Mirza Sahiban, Laila Majnu, Sohni Mahiwal, Bilal Biti etc. Daim got popularity by writing \"Shah Nama Karbla\" and \"Kambal Posh\".\n\nMost of the Punjabi \"qisse\" were written by Muslim poets who wandered the land. The oldest were usually scripted in Urdu. Some of the most popular \"qisse\" are listed below.\n\n\n"}

Common live food ranges from crickets (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly available in pet stores for this reason), waxworms, mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts, to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens. \n\nLive foods commonly available are crickets (both \"Gryllus bimaculatus\" and \"Acheta domesticus\" commonly), waxworms (\"Galleria mellonella\"), mealworms (\"Tenebrio molitor\"), Superworms (\"Zophobas morio\") and locusts (a number of species are seen commonly). There are however many more species used such as butter worms, phoenix worms, a variety of cockroach species, silkworms and more. Insect species are most commonly used to feed small reptiles and amphibians.\n\nAnother common form of live food, most commonly used to feed snakes, is small rodents. The most commonly known small rodent used for live food is likely the mouse; many pet stores which carry snakes or cater to snake owners also carry \"feeder mice\" for this reason (see \"Fancy mouse\"). It is also common to feed reptiles freshly killed or frozen/thawed rodents as most reptiles will readily accept them.\n\nCreatures that are the most common choices for live foods, ranging from feeder mice to crickets and mealworms, generally are bred and raised in captivity themselves, and can often be found both through local pet stores and from wholesalers or \"farms\" that breed them specifically for live food sales.\n\nAnimals that are commonly fed live food include bearded dragon and other lizards, various types of snake, turtles, and carnivorous fish, though other animals, such as skunks (which are sometimes kept as pets), being omnivorous, can also eat some live food, though it is unknown how common this is in practice.\n"}

It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.\n\nIn 1997 the publisher HarperCollins drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997. \"Gamine\" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in \"The Times\" as follows:\n\n\"Gamine\" has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of Anglo-Norman origin – is probably \"waif\" (although \"gamine\" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and chic). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario Andrew Oldham described the 17-year-old singer Marianne Faithfull as \"shy, wistful, waif-like\"; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress Luise Rainer (b. 1910) as Paul Muni's \"waif-wife\" in the 1937 film, \"The Good Earth\".\n\n\"Gaminerie\" has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.\n\nIn the early 20th century, silent films brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born Mary Pickford (1892–1979), who became known as \"America's Sweetheart\" and, with her husband Douglas Fairbanks, was one of the founders of the film production company United Artists; Lillian Gish (1893–1993), notably in \"Way Down East\" (1920); and Louise Brooks (1906–86), whose short bobbed hairstyle, widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a \"Bohemian\" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris \"demi-monde\" before World War I and among London art students during the war.) In 1936, Charlie Chaplin cast his then-girlfriend Paulette Goddard (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as \"A Gamin\") in one of his last silent films, \"Modern Times\".\n\nIn the 1950s \"gamine\" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the Belgian-born actress Audrey Hepburn (1929–1993): for example, in the films, \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"Funny Face\" (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by Colette, who had personally \"talent-spotted\" her when she was filming in Monte Carlo. On film and in photographs, Hepburn's short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring \"look\", well defined by Don Macpherson, who cited her \"naïveté which did not rule out sophistication\", and described her as \"the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic\".\n\nOther film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included Leslie Caron (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of \"Gigi\"; Jean Seberg (1938–79), best known in \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1957) and Jean-Luc Godard’s \"À bout de souffle\" (1960); Jean Simmons (1929-2010), for example, in \"Angel Face\" (1952); and Rita Tushingham (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in \"A Taste of Honey\" (1961). The French singer Juliette Greco (b. 1926), who emerged from Bohemian Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.\n\nIn many ways, the \"gamine look\" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: Jean Shrimpton (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the mini-skirt in 1965; Twiggy (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became \"The Face of '66\"; and Kate Moss (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the \"waif\" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for Calvin Klein in 1997, became known as \"heroin chic.\" Moss was part of a trend of \"wafer\" thin models which was satirized in Neil Kerber’s strip cartoon \"Supermodels\" in the magazine \"Private Eye\".\n\nGamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" stock character.\n\nOthers who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress Anna Karina (b. 1940); American actresses Julia Roberts (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), Edie Sedgwick (1943–1971), Elizabeth Hartman (1943–1987), Mia Farrow (b. 1945), Sissy Spacek (b. 1949), Winona Ryder (b. 1971), Michelle Williams (b. 1980), Gwyneth Paltrow (b. 1972), Calista Flockhart (b. 1964), Bridget Fonda (b. 1964), Mary Stuart Masterson (b. 1966), Jennifer Jason Leigh (b. 1962), and Ginnifer Goodwin (b. 1978); British actresses Carey Mulligan (b. 1985), Susannah York (1939–2011), Suzanna Hamilton (b. 1960), Helena Bonham Carter (b. 1966), Elisabeth Sladen (1946-2011), Carole Ann Ford (b. 1940) Tara FitzGerald (b. 1967), Olivia Williams (b. 1968), Rachel Weisz (b. 1970), Keira Knightley (b. 1985), and Emma Watson (b. 1990); Portuguese actress Maria de Medeiros (b. 1965); French actresses Juliette Binoche (b. 1964), Audrey Tautou (b. 1976), and Vanessa Paradis (b. 1972); Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman (b. 1981); Canadian model Linda Evangelista (b. 1965); American models Kristen McMenamy (b. 1964) and Tina Chow (1951–92) (whose \"gamine look made her the darling of [photographers] Cecil Beaton and Arthur Elgort\"); Russian tennis player Anastasia Myskina (b. 1981); and American singer Cat Power (b. Chan Marshall, 1972) (\"The French, in particular, took to her gamine looks and confused air\").\n\nPenelope Chetwode (1910–86), later Lady Betjeman, wife of the Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, was described by Betjeman's biographer A. N. Wilson as \"gamine of feature, but large-breasted\". Corinne Bailey Rae alleged that she was called a gamine in her song, \"Choux Pastry Heart\" (2005).\n\nJapanese 1990s J-Pop rock band vocalist Maki Watase was called a \"spry gamine firecracker\" in a review in the New Music Express.\n\nAmong the notable gamine characters of film are Gelsomina, the street performer from \"La Strada\", played by Giulietta Masina; Bree Daniels, the prostitute played by Jane Fonda (b. 1937) in \"Klute\" (1971) (whose hairstyle was sometimes referred to as the \"Klute shag\"); Nikita (Anne Parillaud, b. 1960), the titular punkish junkie in Luc Besson's 1990 film; and, most recently, Amélie (Audrey Tautou) in the 2001 romantic comedy of that name; Alice Cullen, the vampire played by Ashley Greene (b. 1987) in \"The Twilight Saga\" (2008) .\n"}
{"id": "5734477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5734477", "title": "Rí", "text": "Rí\n\nRí, or commonly ríg (genitive), is an ancient Gaelic word meaning \"king\". It is used in historical texts referring to the Irish and Scottish kings, and those of similar rank. While the Modern Irish word is exactly the same, in modern Scottish Gaelic it is \"rìgh\", apparently derived from the genitive. Cognates include Gaulish \"Rix\", Latin \"rex/regis\", Sanskrit \"raja\", and German \"Reich\".\n\nThere were three grades of \"rí\": a ruirí or \"overking\" was a major, regional king and superior to a \"rí tuath\" \"king of tribes\" or a \"rí buiden\" \"king of bands\" either of whom, in turn, were superior to several figures known as \"rí benn\" \"king of peaks\" or \"rí tuaithe\" \"king of a tribe\".\n\nThe three traditional grades of \"rí\" in Gaelic Ireland was largely symbolic. As time went on, the real power of many lesser kings could equal or even eclipse those of higher grade.\n\nA \"rí benn\" (king of peaks), or \"rí tuaithe\" (king of a single tribe), was most commonly a local petty king of a single túath, although \"one\" túath might be many times the size of another. There are generally estimated to have been between 100 and 150 in Ireland, depending on who really qualified.\n\nImportantly, in theory every king of a superior grade was also a \"ri benn\" himself, and exercised no direct compulsory legal authority outside his own ancestral túath. Kings were bound to others by military allegiance and the payment of tribute.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nA \"ri buiden\" (king of bands), also \"ri tuath\" (king of [many] tribes) or \"ruiri\" (overking), was a regional king to whom several \"rí benn\" were subordinate, and often other territories. He was in some sense still a petty king, but could also achieve provincial-level prominence, including, although rarely, the provincial kingship, and was often fully sovereign in any case. Depending on who was counted, there may have been as many as 20 genuine \"ruiri\" in Ireland at any time.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nA \"king of over-kings\", a \"rí ruirech\" was often a provincial (\"rí cóicid\") or semi-provincial king to whom several \"ruiri\" were subordinate. They were also referred to as \"ri bunaid cach cinn\" (\"ultimate king of every individual\"). Several kingdoms belonging to the 1st and 2nd millennia are listed below, but do not all belong to the same periods. No more than six genuine \"rí ruirech\" were ever contemporary, with the average being three or four. Originally, there were only five provinces, at least according to legend (see the Táin Bó Cúailnge, the actual text thereof).\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nScotland appears to have had a variety of \"rí\" as well. In addition to the monarch or \"high king\" there were others, although these are conventionally styled only \"lords\" in the English language.\n\nThere were also a number of Kings of Moray, who are commonly styled mormaers in later Scottish tradition, but properly styled \"rí\" in contemporary Irish sources. The famous Macbeth of Scotland is argued to have begun his career as \"Ruiri\" of Moray.\n\n\n"}

While most bird food is fed to commercial fowl, people also use bird food to feed pet birds or wild birds.\n\nThe various types of bird food reflect the species of bird that can be fed, whether they are carnivores or nectar eating birds.\n\nWhile it is a popular practice to feed wild birds from bird feeders, they can carry potential risks for the birds that feed there, such as disease, malnutrition, and predation by domestic animals.\n\nBlack sunflower seeds are highly recommended for use in bird feeders because they attract a wide variety of birds, have a high ratio of meat to shell, and are high in fat content. Other common bird seeds include Niger, or thistle seed, a favorite of goldfinches, millet for sparrows and juncos, and safflower for cardinals, among others.\n\nSuet is recommended for insect-eating birds like nuthatches and woodpeckers. Artificial nectar – essentially sugar water – attracts hummingbirds. Bread and kitchen scraps are often fed to ducks and gulls (although this can lead to nutrient deficiencies and increased defecation for the birds in question). Chickens are commonly fed maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and milling by-products, in a mixture traditionally called chicken scratch.\n\nThese seeds and non-seed supplies are commonly obtained as by-products on farms, but can also be bought from independent retailers.\n\nCommercial bird food is widely available for feeding wild and domesticated birds, both seed combinations and pellets.\n\nWhen feeding wild birds the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) suggests that it be done year round, with different mixes of nutrients being offered each season. Selections should have additional fat content in the winter months, and additional proteins in the form of nuts, seeds and dried worms in summer when birds are changing their plumage and may be molting.\n\nFarmed birds fed commercial bird food typically are given very specific scientifically designed pre-blended feed. Examples of commercial bird food for chickens include chick starter medicated crumbles, chick grower crumbles, egg layer mash, egg layer pellet, egg layer crumbles, egg producer pellet, and broiler maker med crumbles. Pellet crumbles are often prepared for tiny chicks. Mash is more finely ground.\n\n"}
{"id": "5741239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5741239", "title": "Chicken as food", "text": "Chicken as food\n\nChicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.\n\nChicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.\n\nThe poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.\n\nThe modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nChicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages. For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere, including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in \"blancmange\", a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.\n\nIn the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was \"sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish.\" Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).\nModern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.\n\nChickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.\n\nCapons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.\n\n\nChicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.\n\nChicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.\n\nIn factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA. The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that \"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern\".\n\nInformation obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) \"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production\". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.\n\nA recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with \"S. aureus\", with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States. An estimated 90–100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.\n\nIn random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms (CAFO), the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g. sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.).\n\nDuring shipping from the CAFO farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.\n\nThere is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed. The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g. bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. Unfortunately, the fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove.\n\nWith slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds/minute, safety inspectors do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal matter. The USDA is currently allowing some abattoirs to process at unlimited line speeds (i.e. in excess of 140 birds/minute), further exascerbating the fecal contamination issue.\n\nJuvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter in the United Kingdom are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large.\n\nWhole mature chickens are marketed in the United States as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4 lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Most dismembered packaged chicken would be sold whole as fryers. Broilers are larger than fryers. They are typically sold whole. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3–5 months and 6-8 lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready.\n\nChicken is also sold in dismembered pieces. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless and/or skinless. Chicken livers and/or gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts.\n\nThere are many fast food restaurant chains on both a national and global scale that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries.\n\nRaw chicken may contain \"salmonella\". The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites. However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called \"torisashi\", which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is \"toriwasa\" which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.\n\nChicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos.\n\nChickens often come with labels such as \"roaster\", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.\n\nSome chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker \"with rib meat\". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, \"tenders\" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called \"chicken mini-fillets\".\n\nChicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.\n\nIn Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either \"chicken frames\" or \"chicken carcasses\" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.\n\nRaw chicken maintains its quality longer in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking. There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage. For optimal quality, however, a maximal storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets, and 4 months for cooked chicken. Freezing doesn't usually cause color changes in poultry, but the bones and the meat near them can become dark. This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed.\n\nIt is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages. It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is. If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it. Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices won't drip onto other foods. If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.\n\nChicken can be cooked or reheated from the frozen state, but it will take approximately one and a half times as long to cook, and any wrapping or absorbent paper should be discarded. There are three generally accepted safe methods of reheating frozen chicken: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or using a microwave oven. These methods are endorsed by the FDA as safe, as they minimize the risk of bacterial growth. Bacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.\n\n"}

They were invented by William Halliday Davies (1919–2009), production manager at the Quaker Oats mill in Southall. For many years they were made by the Quaker Oats Company, but in 2006 they were sold to Big Bear t/a Honey Monster Foods, based in Leicester. \n\nIn 2016, food manufacturer Brecks Company took over production of Honey Monster Puffs under licence.\n\nThe cereal is known for its Honey Monster mascot, a large, hairy, yellow creature introduced in 1976. In 2014 the product was re-branded to Honey Monster Puffs, and its recipe changed to have 8% less sugar and 20% more honey, so that the total sugar content is now 29% by mass, and the honey content has increased from 3% to 3.6%.\n\nThere have been a number of variations on the basic product, during the 1990s and 2000s including:\n\nSugar Puffs posters can clearly be seen in the 1966 film \"\". They helped to finance the film, and in return held a giveaway contest in which the grand prize was a Dalek prop made for the film.\n\nThe cereal's mascot is the Honey Monster, a large, hairy, yellow humanoid creature who was first seen on TV in 1976 in an advertisement created by John Webster of the advertising agency BMP. The advert focused around a nutritional message which was illustrated by the parent and child relationship of actor Henry McGee and the Honey Monster. The monster shouts \"Tell them about the honey, mummy!\" to which McGee responds \"I'm not his mummy!\". The monster then proceeds to destroy the set.\n\nIn the late 1980s, \"Sugar Puffs\" advertisements featured the slogan \"You'll Go Monster-Mad For The Honey\". These advertisements portrayed children trying to get access to a packet of Sugar Puffs with someone or something then preventing them from getting the Sugar Puffs. The children would then cry \"I Want My Honey!!\" and they would then turn into Sugar Puffs Honey Monsters and thus get the Sugar Puffs.\n\nThere were a number of settings for these advertisements. The advertisements themselves were:\n\nAfter these advertisements, the Sugar Puffs Honey Monster was then seen in advertisements in which he was depicted playing football and also as a James Bond-style hero. Punk poet John Cooper Clarke also featured in a series of off the wall adverts in the 1990s. An advertisement showing the Honey Monster onstage with Boyzone at Wembley Arena aired in 1996, and was voted #17 in ITV's Best TV Ads Ever 2 list in 2006, sharing the position with the original 1976 advert. Another of the 1996 adverts showed him winning a football match. In 1998, an advert which depicted him as \"Puff\" Daddy aired. In 1999, an advert called \"Monster Men vs Breakin' Boyz\" aired. A modern style remake of the original 1976 advert aired in 2003.\n\nIn March 2008, a new campaign was launched with a television advertisement. The spot featured Honey Monster and his housemate sitting at their breakfast table, singing a nonsense song about Sugar Puffs, in the scat style. Finishing with the strapline ‘Feed the fun’, the advertisement represented the idea that Honey Monster brings out the child in everyone. The advert was criticised by Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding of the comedy duo The Mighty Boosh, who considered it to be a plagiarisation of the \"crimping\" songs in their television series.\n\nIn August 2008 the Honey Monster featured in a charity video and single by the group Samanda, called \"Honey Love\". Another new advert was broadcast for the Honey Waffles cereal variant, returning the Honey Monster to his true self along with his undying love for honey. The ad ends with the tagline (as said by the Honey Monster) \"Don't tell 'em about the honey, mummy\", a reference to the Sugar Puffs endline from the 1970s.\n\nThe Honey Monster was used as part of a recurring gag in the film \"Four Lions\" when one of the main characters uses an outfit of the character as a disguise in the final act.\n\nIn the British science-fiction show \"Red Dwarf\", Dave Lister is fond of Sugar Puff sandwiches. \nIn 2009, as part of Red Nose Day, Honey Monster appeared with many other advertising icons in a self-deprecating sketch called 'The Greatest Minds in Advertising'. As the punchline Honey Monster silences his colleagues by singing a song in falsetto (not his trademark deep voice) exhorting people not to buy advertised products but to give their money to Comic Relief instead.\n\n\n"}

As the Korean language does not distinguish between singular and plural grammatically, the word is used for both one such dish or all of them combined.\nThe basic table setting for a meal called \"bansang\" (반상) usually consists of \"bap\" (밥, cooked rice), \"guk\" or \"tang\" (soup), \"gochujang\" or \"ganjang\", \"jjigae\", and \"kimchi\". According to the number of \"banchan\" added, the table setting is called \"3 cheop\" (삼첩), \"5 cheop\" (오첩), \"7 cheop\" (칠첩), \"9 cheop\" (구첩), \"12 cheop\" (십이첩) \"bansang\", with the \"12 cheop\" used in Korean royal cuisine.\n\n\"Banchan\" are set in the middle of the table to be shared. At the center of the table is the secondary main course, such as \"galbi\" or \"bulgogi\", and a shared pot of \"jjigae\". Bowls of cooked rice and \"guk\" (soup) are set individually. \"Banchan\" are served in small portions, meant to be finished at each meal and are replenished during the meal if not enough. Usually, the more formal the meals are, the more \"banchan\" there will be. Jeolla province is particularly famous for serving many different varieties of \"banchan\" in a single meal.\n\n\"Banchan\" is thought to be a result of Buddhist influence at around the mid-Three Kingdoms period and the subsequent proscription against eating meat by the monarchies of these kingdoms. Thus, with the ban on meat-containing dishes, vegetable-based dishes rose in prominence and became the centrepoint of Korean cuisine; court kitchens developed various methods for cooking, preparing and presenting these dishes, while less-affluent commoners produced smaller, simpler arrays of these vegetable-based dishes.\n\nAlthough the Mongol invasions of Korea ended the ban on meat-containing dishes, as well as meat offerings for rituals such as \"jesa\", approximately six centuries of vegetable-based cuisine in the form of \"banchan\" had imprinted itself into Korean cuisine.\n\nKimchi is fermented vegetables, usually \"baechu\" (Napa cabbage), seasoned with chili peppers and salt. This is the essential \"banchan\" of a standard Korean meal. \nSome Koreans do not consider a meal complete without kimchi. Kimchi can be made with other vegetables as well, including scallions, \"gat\" (갓), and radish (무; \"mu\").\n\nNamul (나물) refers to steamed, marinated, or stir-fried vegetables usually seasoned with sesame oil, salt, vinegar, minced garlic, chopped green onions, dried chili peppers, and soy sauce.\nBokkeum (볶음) is a dish stir-fried with sauce.\n\nJorim is a dish simmered in a seasoned broth.\n\nJjim is a steamed dish.\n\n\"Jeon\" denotes a variety of pan-fried, pancake-like dishes. \"Buchimgae\" is a near synonym. \n\n\n\n"}

It is prepared with goat meat, tomato, celery, spring onion, ginger, candlenut and lime leaf, its broth is yellowish in color.\n\nIn Indonesia, \"sup kambing\" is quite widespread as numbers of similar goat meat soup recipes can be found. However, it is mostly associated with Malay of Medan, Betawi and Madura cuisine, although it is also common in Java. Nevertheless, Javanese are more likely to cook their goat meat as \"tongseng\" or Javanese-style soupy \"gulai\" instead. Traditionally, \"sup kambing\" together with \"gulai\" and \"sate kambing\" are quite widespread during Eid al-Adha, as large amount of goat meat and offals being distributed among people.\n\nIn Malaysia, \"sup kambing\" is associated with Muslim Malaysian Indian community and believed to be of Indian origin. In Singapore, the dish is also associated with the Muslim Indian community of the island.\n\nThere are many versions of \"sup kambing\" recipes, however there are two main groups of \"sup kambing\" traditions; the Indonesian version are derived mainly from Arab, and to some extent, Dutch influences, while Malaysian and Singaporean version is often called as \"sup kambing Mamak\" which solely derived from Muslim Indian influences. Other main differences are the Malaysian and Singaporean version consists of the chunks of goat meat in yellowish, rather thick and oily broth with rich spices; while in Indonesian version, the goat meat often also includes its bones (ribs or leg bones), has a lighter broth and balanced spices, and it also contains slices of vegetables including tomato, leek, celery, carrot and sometimes potato.\n\nA simple \"sup kambing\" recipe uses goat meat, slices of tomato, leek, celery, and ground spices which includes; ginger, pepper, garlic, shallot and salt. However, another elaborate recipes might add more complex spices, which might includes cardamom, cinnamon, candlenut, nutmeg, clove and star anise to add aroma and taste.\n\nDespite its wide popularity in the region, the question of origin however, might be owed to the Arabs and Muslim Indian migrations into the Malay archipelago. In Indonesia, \"sup kambing\" is believed to be of Arab origin, brought by the influx of Arabs migrants into the archipelago between the 18th to 19th century, during colonial era. The Arabs settlers introduced and promoted goat, lamb and mutton as their preferred meat, thus several dishes influenced by Arab and Muslim Indian culinary traditions were introduced to Sumatra, Malay peninsula and Java. Around the same period, other mutton or goat-based dishes such as \"sate kambing\", \"gulai kambing\" and \"tongseng\" were also appeared in Java.\n\nThe early Arab immigrants settled in coastal towns of Sumatra and Java, and subsequently influenced the culture of native ethnic groups including Sumatran Malays, the Betawis of Batavia (Jakarta), also Javanese and Madurese of East Java. The \"sup kambing\" was adopted by locals, and often linked to Islamic festival of \"kurban\" (Eid al-Adha), where large numbers of cattles — including goats, are slaughtered and distributed among people. As the result, despite its Arab origin, today in Indonesia \"sup kambing\" is more associated with Malay, Madurese and Betawi cuisine. Indonesian \"sup kambing\" uses carrot, tomato and sometimes potato, which hints its European (possibly Portuguese or Dutch) influences. Tomato and potato are not available in Southeast Asia, until European colonials brought them from the Americas around the 17th century. The \"sup kambing\" from Medan in North Sumatra however, is more closer to the Malaysian version, since they commonly derived from Muslim Indian culture.\nIn Malay Peninsula region, which today includes Malaysia and Singapore, the most popular version is \"sup kambing Mamak\" which is believed was invented by the Muslim Indian community there, where the use of typical spices is quite notable. There is no exact equivalent of this soup in Indian sub-continent, although the spices used and the style of cooking clearly demonstrates Indian influence. The dish is also adopted by native Malays in the country.\n\nIn Indonesia the soup is prepared in rich savoury broth with spices and ingredients similar to other Indonesian favourite, \"sop buntut\" (oxtail soup). Common \"sop kambing\" uses goat meat, also its ribs; however, in Indonesia there is a more specific \"sop kambing\" called \"sop kepala kambing\" which uses offals of goat's head, which includes its tongue, ear, lips and cheek meats, eyes and sometimes brain. Another specific \"sup kambing\" is called \"sop kaki kambing\" which uses goat's trotters.\n\n\n"}

All such attempts failed, possibly due to the lack of a single location of celebrations, or commercial organisations failing to condemn some of the celebrations' more \"questionable\" activities. Most recently, in 2012 some 12,000 people met the sunrise at Kamen Bryag where the song \"July Morning\" was performed by ex-Uriah Heep's singer John Lawton.\n\nThe name of the tradition comes from the British rock band Uriah Heep's 1971 hit \"July Morning\" which became widely popular in Bulgaria in the 1980s and somehow named and remained central to this unique Bulgarian tradition.\n\nThere are many versions of the meaning of the tradition. Most people consider July Morning a celebration of a new beginning and freedom in the spirit of the hippie movement. For others, it is a good reason for a late night/early morning party as July 1 is the first day of summer break for most high schools in Bulgaria and the unofficial start of the summer vacationing season, traditionally culminating with a trip to the Black Sea coast in July or August.\n\nJuly Morning may be related to sun worship (see also Peter Deunov) and to midsummer night rites popular throughout Bulgarian lands from time immemorial.\n\nThe various accounts on the beginnings of July Morning vary widely, mostly depending on the meaning that the teller puts into the tradition.\n\nIt is said that the July Morning arose sometime in the 1980s among young people as a subtle protest against the Communist regime. Even though, there are no records of organised protests there were informal and sporadic marches called 'happening' (Хепънинг). After studying subcultures in Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria, Nikola Božilović argues that the subcultural self of adolescents comprises a certain degree of symbolic aggression which serves to challenge authorities, to oppose regulations and to refute social conventions. That is why it is well-grounded to consider rock subcultural identities of the young as identities for resistance. \n\nMany young people felt attracted to some of the so-called hippie ideals from the 1960s, communicated mainly through rock and pop music of the time. As a country behind the Iron Curtain, Bulgaria did not have a music market similar to the ones in the Western countries and it was not uncommon for albums and tracks by Western artists to become popular years, sometimes decades, after their initial release. This seems to be the case with Uriah Heep's song \"July Morning\".\n"}

Pork and duck are the most common animal used to create this raw blood pudding. The most popular is \"tiết canh vịt,\" made from freshly killed duck blood and duck meat.\n\nThe freshly drawn blood is collected in a bowl, and prevented from premature coagulation (hãm huyết), by mixing it with some fish sauce of certain proportions, usually three to five soup spoons of fish sauce for one quart (approximately 1 liter) of blood. Finely chopped meat such as cooked duck innards (gizzards, for example) and duck meat are put in a shallow dish along with a sprinkling of crushed peanuts and chopped herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, mint, etc. The blood and fish sauce mixture is then diluted with some watery broth left from cooking the meat and/or gizzards to promote blood coagulation, then quickly poured into the prepared meat dish. After the blood has set, the finished dish resembles a pizza. The finished dish can be kept cooled in the refrigerator, which allows the blood to maintain its coagulated state, when immediate consumption is not called for right away. If the dish is removed from the refrigerator and left to sit at room temperature for a while the blood will return to a liquid state.\n\nRaw pig’s blood often contains swine bacteria, and ingesting them may cause severe bacterial infections. For example, a \"streptococcus bacterium\" infection may cause respiratory decline, blood contamination, and severe necrosis in arms and legs, and is potentially fatal. In Vietnam, there are reports of human casualties after eating raw blood pudding.\n\n\n"}

Almond potatoes are yellow or white; in rare cases a variety called blue almond (Blå mandel in swedish) can be found which has yellow-white flesh with blue skin. Its shape is oval and somewhat resembles an almond, hence the name. Blue almond is an old variety which was grown in the northern regions of Sweden before the yellow-peeled almond potato was introduced.\n\nIt is considered a delicacy in Norway and in Sweden, where it is most commonly grown in the northern parts. It can be grown better in the north, since the variety is susceptible to plant diseases in the south. Finnish Lapland puikula (\"Lapin puikula\") has a European Union Protected Designation of Origin.\n"}

Due to the migration of South Indians, banana leaf rice can also be found in areas with significant ethnic South Indian diaspora such as Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nIn banana leaf meals, white rice (or parboiled rice in authentic South Indian restaurants) is served on a banana leaf with an assortment of vegetables, pickles, appalam and other regional condiments (usually sour, salty or spicy). The banana leaf acts as a disposable plate and it in itself is not consumed. The choice of banana leaves is mainly due to the broad leaves as well as to the ubiquity of the plant in South India. Typically, only vegetarian gravy (e.g. sambar) will be served on the rice as it is meant to be a traditional vegetarian dish. However, sometimes boiled eggs, curried or fried meat or seafood are served as well. Traditionally, there will be two servings of rice with the first being served with gravy, side dishes and condiments whilst the second serving will be just rice with curd as a palate cleanser.\n\nBanana leaf meals are eaten by hand. Banana leaf meal etiquette also dictates that, after the meal, the guest must always fold the banana leaf inwards as a sign of gratitude to the host, even when the host is the proprietor of an eatery. However, when meals are served at funeral wakes, the leaf is folded outwards as a sign of condolence to the family of the deceased. Due to this, folding the leaf outwards is considered rude in any other circumstance.\n\n"}

The most famous nasi dagang comes from Tumpat in Kelantan and Kampung Ladang in Kuala Terengganu.\n\nThe combination of fenugreek seeds and coconut milk gives nasi dagang its unique flavour and fragrance. The rice may first be soaked in water for several hours to soften it. It is then mixed with thick coconut milk, sliced shallots, lemongrass and fenugreek seeds. The rice is steamed until cooked. It may also be steamed twice, where more coconut milk is added when it is half-cooked. Then the rice is steamed again until cooked. This method ensures a more creamy finish to the rice.\n\nThis accompanying dish is only specially prepared for nasi dagang and is sometimes locally called \"gulai darat\".\n\nThis curry the fish is cooked in is not an Indian-style curry powder but a Malay-style curry, i.e., coconut milk mixed with traditional Malay spices such as lemon grass, galangal, chilli paste, and turmeric.\n\nTuna is the standard choice of fish but other fish can be used as well, such as \"tenggiri\". Chicken and prawns are also used sometimes; however, the \"gulai darat\" is prepared slightly differently.\n\nKelapa Parut is freshly shaved, mixed with sliced shallots and fried until golden brown.\n\nHard boiled eggs are cut into four or eight slices.\n\nThe vegetable is pickled in rice vinegar and sugar. The vegetables commonly used are cucumber, chilli and carrots.\n\nChilli sambal can sometimes be included.\n\nThe Terengganu version uses the normal white rice, while the Kelantanese variety uses a type of rice locally called 'beras nasi dagang', which is a type of wild rice that has a light purple colour and a little glutinous. The Terengganuan version is also much simpler, eaten only with the fish curry (sometimes with \"belimbing buluh\" added) and pickles.\n\nAlso a staple breakfast in the deep south of Thailand (Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat), the nasi dagang of southern Thailand features an additional Telur pindang (Herb-boiled eggs) to its menu. While across the South China Sea, the nasi dagang in Natuna attributed a similar kind with the Terangganese version of the rice, this is likely due to the strong historical connection between the island and the east coast of Malay Peninsula.\n\nSome people from the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia claim of the \"nasi lemak\" being nonexistent in the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia or the \"Pantai Timur\", with the \"nasi dagang\" replacing the dish instead. This claim is actually unheard of in either region as both dishes can commonly be found sold side by side for breakfast.\n\n\n"}

A few years later Alessandro Martini joined the team, becoming the director in 1863 along with Teofilo Sola and Luigi Rossi (who was the inventor of a vermouth). In 1863 they changed the company name to Martini, Sola & Cia. They started exporting bottles of vermouth around the world. New York city was given its first crates in 1867. At the time the firm was awarded several prizes, which are still recorded on the bottles: Dublin (1865), Paris (1867 and 1878), Vienna (1873) and Philadelphia (1876). Just thirty years after its creation, Martini was available in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Egypt and other countries. In 1879 the Sola family sold its interests to the remaining partners, who renamed the company Martini & Rossi, as it stands today.\n\nThe brand may have given the American martini vermouth and gin cocktail its name (an early recipe for which is known from 1888), though other speculations on the cocktail's etymology exist.\n\nIn 1892 the business was taken over by Rossi's four sons; control passed to his grandsons in 1930. In 1929 the Martini Ball & Bar logo was registered for the first time. Restructuring was carried out in 1977 resulting in the creation of the General Beverage Corporation. In 1992 Martini & Rossi merged with Bacardi. “Martini is the world's fourth most powerful ‘spirit’ brand” according to a survey of the market in 2006.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971 Martini together with Rossi supported the so-called \"Ladies Football World Championships\". These tournaments were entirely independent from FIFA and the common national soccer associations. They were held in Rome and in Mexico.\n\nMartini is made from four ingredients: wine, botanicals, sugar and alcohol\n\n\n\n"}
