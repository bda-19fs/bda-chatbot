{"id": "160227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160227", "title": "Nestlé", "text": "Nestlé\n\nNestlé S.A. (, ; ) is a Swiss transnational food and drink company headquartered in Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. It is the largest food company in the world, measured by revenues and other metrics, since 2014. It ranked No. 64 on the Fortune Global 500 in 2017 and No. 33 on the 2016 edition of the Forbes Global 2000 list of largest public companies.\n\nNestlé's products include baby food, medical food, bottled water, breakfast cereals, coffee and tea, confectionery, dairy products, ice cream, frozen food, pet foods, and snacks. Twenty-nine of Nestlé's brands have annual sales of over CHF1 billion (about ), including Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, Stouffer's, Vittel, and Maggi. Nestlé has 447 factories, operates in 189 countries, and employs around 339,000 people. It is one of the main shareholders of L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics company.\n\nNestlé was formed in 1905 by the merger of the Anglo-Swiss Milk Company, established in 1866 by brothers George and Charles Page, and Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé, founded in 1866 by Henri Nestlé. The company grew significantly during the First World War and again following the Second World War, expanding its offerings beyond its early condensed milk and infant formula products. The company has made a number of corporate acquisitions, including Crosse & Blackwell in 1950, Findus in 1963, Libby's in 1971, Rowntree Mackintosh in 1988, Klim in 1998, and Gerber in 2007.\n\nNestlé has a primary listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange and is a constituent of the Swiss Market Index. It has a secondary listing on Euronext.\n\nNestlé's origins date back to the 1860s, when two separate Swiss enterprises were founded that would later form the core of Nestlé. In the succeeding decades, the two competing enterprises aggressively expanded their businesses throughout Europe and the United States.\n\nIn 1866, Charles Page (US consul to Switzerland) and George Page, brothers from Lee County, Illinois, USA, established the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham, Switzerland. Their first British operation was opened at Chippenham, Wiltshire, in 1873.\n\nIn 1867, in Vevey, Henri Nestlé developed milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it. The following year saw Daniel Peter begin seven years of work perfecting his invention, the milk chocolate manufacturing process. Nestlé was the crucial co-operation that Peter needed to solve the problem of removing all the water from the milk added to his chocolate and thus preventing the product from developing mildew. Henri Nestlé retired in 1875 but the company, under new ownership, retained his name as \"Société Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé\".\n\nIn 1877, Anglo-Swiss added milk-based baby foods to their products; in the following year, the Nestlé Company added condensed milk to their portfolio, which made the firms direct and fierce rivals.\n\nIn 1879, Nestlé merged with milk chocolate inventor Daniel Peter.\n\nIn 1904, François-Louis Cailler, Charles Amédée Kohler, Daniel Peter, and Henri Nestlé participated in the creation and development of Swiss chocolate, marketing the first chocolate – milk Nestlé.\n\nIn 1905, the companies merged to become the Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, retaining that name until 1947 when the name 'Nestlé Alimentana SA' was taken as a result of the acquisition of Fabrique de Produits Maggi SA (founded 1884) and its holding company, Alimentana SA, of Kempttal, Switzerland. Maggi was a major manufacturer of soup mixes and related foodstuffs. The company's current name was adopted in 1977. By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The First World War created demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts, and, by the end of the war, Nestlé's production had more than doubled.\nIn January 1919, Nestlé bought two condensed milk plants in Oregon from the company Geibisch and Joplin for $250,000. One was in Bandon, while the other was in Milwaukie. They expanded them considerably, processing 250,000 pounds of condensed milk daily in the Bandon plant.\n\nNestlé felt the effects of the Second World War immediately. Profits dropped from US$20 million in 1938 to US$6 million in 1939. Factories were established in developing countries, particularly in Latin America. Ironically, the war helped with the introduction of the company's newest product, Nescafé (\"Nestlé's Coffee\"), which became a staple drink of the US military. Nestlé's production and sales rose in the wartime economy.\n\nAfter the war, government contracts dried up, and consumers switched back to fresh milk. However, Nestlé's management responded quickly, streamlining operations and reducing debt. The 1920s saw Nestlé's first expansion into new products, with chocolate-manufacture becoming the company's second most important activity. Louis Dapples was CEO till 1937 when succeeded by Édouard Muller till his death in 1948.\n\nThe end of World War II was the beginning of a dynamic phase for Nestlé. Growth accelerated and numerous companies were acquired. In 1947 Nestlé merged with Maggi, a manufacturer of seasonings and soups. Crosse & Blackwell followed in 1950, as did Findus (1963), Libby's (1971), and Stouffer's (1973). Diversification came with a shareholding in L'Oreal in 1974. In 1977, Nestlé made its second venture outside the food industry, by acquiring Alcon Laboratories Inc.\n\nIn the 1980s, Nestlé's improved bottom line allowed the company to launch a new round of acquisitions. Carnation was acquired for $3 billion in 1984 and brought the evaporated milk brand, as well as Coffee-Mate and Friskies to Nestlé. In 1986 Nestlé Nespresso S.A. was founded. The confectionery company Rowntree Mackintosh was acquired in 1988 for $4.5 billion, which brought brands such as Kit Kat, Smarties, and Aero.\n\nThe first half of the 1990s proved to be favourable for Nestlé. Trade barriers crumbled, and world markets developed into more or less integrated trading areas. Since 1996, there have been various acquisitions, including San Pellegrino (1997), D'Onofrio (1997), Spillers Petfoods (1998), and Ralston Purina (2002). There were two major acquisitions in North America, both in 2002 – in June, Nestlé merged its US ice cream business into Dreyer's, and in August, a acquisition was announced of Chef America, the creator of Hot Pockets. In the same time-frame, Nestlé entered in a joint bid with Cadbury and came close to purchasing the iconic American company Hershey's, one of its fiercest confectionery competitors, but the deal eventually fell through.\n\nIn December 2005, Nestlé bought the Greek company Delta Ice Cream for €240million. In January 2006, it took full ownership of Dreyer's, thus becoming the world's largest ice cream maker, with a 17.5% market share. In July 2007, completing a deal announced the year before, Nestlé acquired the Medical Nutrition division of Novartis Pharmaceutical for , also acquiring, the milk-flavoring product known as Ovaltine, the \"Boost\" and \"Resource\" lines of nutritional supplements, and Optifast dieting products.\nIn April 2007, returning to its roots, Nestlé bought US baby-food manufacturer Gerber for . In December 2007, Nestlé entered into a strategic partnership with a Belgian chocolate maker, Pierre Marcolini.\n\nNestlé agreed to sell its controlling stake in Alcon to Novartis on 4 January 2010. The sale was to form part of a broader offer, by Novartis, for full acquisition of the world's largest eye-care company. On 1 March 2010, Nestlé concluded the purchase of Kraft Foods's North American frozen pizza business for .\n\nSince 2010, Nestle has been working to transform itself into a nutrition, health and wellness company in an effort to combat declining confectionery sales and the threat of expanding government regulation of such foods. This effort is being led through the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences under the direction of Ed Baetge. The institute aims to develop \"a new industry between food and pharmaceuticals\" by creating foodstuffs with preventative and corrective health properties that would replace pharmaceutical drugs from pill bottles. The Health Science branch has already produced several products, such as drinks and protein shakes meant to combat malnutrition, diabetes, digestive health, obesity, and other diseases.\n\nIn July 2011, Nestlé SA agreed to buy 60 percent of Hsu Fu Chi International Ltd. for about . On 23 April 2012, Nestlé agreed to acquire Pfizer Inc.'s infant-nutrition, formerly Wyeth Nutrition, unit for , topping a joint bid from Danone and Mead Johnson.\n\nIn recent years, Nestlé Health Science has made several acquisitions. It acquired Vitaflo, which makes clinical nutritional products for people with genetic disorders; CM&D Pharma Ltd., a company that specialises in the development of products for patients with chronic conditions like kidney disease; and Prometheus Laboratories, a firm specialising in treatments for gastrointestinal diseases and cancer. It also holds a minority stake in Vital Foods, a New Zealand-based company that develops kiwifruit-based solutions for gastrointestinal conditions as of 2012.\n\nAnother recent purchase included the Jenny Craig weight-loss program, for . Nestlé sold the Jenny Craig business unit to North Castle Partners in 2013. In February 2013, Nestlé Health Science bought Pamlab, which makes medical foods based on L-methylfolate targeting depression, diabetes, and memory loss. In February 2014, Nestlé sold its PowerBar sports nutrition business to Post Holdings, Inc. Later, in November 2014, Nestlé announced that it was exploring strategic options for its frozen food subsidiary, Davigel.\n\nIn December 2014, Nestlé announced that it was opening 10 skin care research centres worldwide, deepening its investment in a faster-growing market for healthcare products. That year, Nestlé spent about $350 million on dermatology research and development. The first of the research hubs, Nestlé Skin Health Investigation, Education and Longevity Development (SHIELD) centres, will open mid 2015 in New York, followed by Hong Kong and São Paulo, and later others in North America, Asia, and Europe. The initiative is being launched in partnership with the Global Coalition on Aging (GCOA), a consortium that includes companies such as Intel and Bank of America.\n\nNestlé announced in January 2017 that it was relocating its U.S. headquarters from Glendale, California, to Rosslyn, Virginia outside of Washington, DC.\n\nIn March 2017, Nestlé announced that they will lower the sugar content in Kit Kat, Yorkie and Aero chocolate bars by 10% by 2018. In July followed a similar announcement concerning the reduction of sugar content in its breakfast cereals in the UK.\n\nThe company announced a $20.8 billion share buyback in June 2017, following the publication of a letter written by Third Point Management founder Daniel S. Loeb, Nestlé's fourth-largest stakeholder with a $3.5 billion stake, explaining how the firm should change its business structure. Consequently, the firm will reportedly focus investment on sectors such as coffee and pet care and will seek acquisitions in the consumer health-care industry.\n\nIn September 2017, Nestlé S.A. acquired a majority stake of Blue Bottle. While the deal's financial details were not disclosed, the Financial Times reported \"Nestle is understood to be paying up to $500m for the 68 per cent stake in Blue Bottle\". Blue Bottle expects to increase sales by 70% this year.\n\nIn September 2017, Nestlé USA agreed to acquire Sweet Earth, a California-based producer of plant-based foods, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIn January 2018, Nestlé USA announced it is selling its U.S. confectionary business to Ferrero, an Italian chocolate and candy maker. The company was sold for a total of an estimated $2.8 billion.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Nestlé and Starbucks struck a $7.15 billion distribution deal, which allows Nestlé to market, sell and distribute Starbucks coffee globally and to incorporate the brand's coffee varieties into Nestlé's proprietary single-serve system, expanding the overseas markets for both companies.\n\nNestle set a new profit target in September 2017 and agreed to offload over 20 of its US candy brands in January 2018. However, sales grew only 2.4% in 2017, and as of July 2018, share price declined more than 8%. While some suggestions were adopted, Loeb said in a July 2018 letter that the shifts are too small and too slow. In a statement, Nestle wrote that it was \"delivering results\" and listed actions it had taken, including investing in key brands and its global coffee partnership with Starbucks. However, activist investors disagreed, leading Third Point Management to launch NestleNOW, a website to push its case with recommendations calling for change, accusing Nestle of not being as fast, aggressive, or strategic as it needs to be. Activist investors called for Nestle to divide into three units with distinct CEOs, regional structures, and marketing heads - beverage, nutrition, and grocery; spin off more businesses that do not fit its model such as ice cream, frozen foods, and confectionery; and add an outsider with expertise in the food and beverage industry to the board.\n\nIn October 2018, Nestlé announced the launch of the Nestlé Alumni Network through a strategic partnership with SAP & EnterpriseAlumni to engage their over 1million Alumni globally.\n\nIn September 2018, Nestlé announced to sell Gerber Life Insurance for $1.55 billion.\n\nNestlé is the biggest food company in the world, with a market capitalisation of roughly 231 billion Swiss francs, which is more than US$247 billion as of May 2015.\n\nIn 2014, consolidated sales were CHF 91.61 billion and net profit was CHF 14.46billion. Research and development investment was CHF 1.63billion.\n\nAccording to a 2015 global survey of online consumers by the \"Reputation Institute\", Nestlé has a reputation score of 74.5 on a scale of 1100.\n\nJoint ventures include:\n\nAs of 2017 the board is composed of:\n\nThe company engages 3rd party lobbying firms to engage with parliaments and governments in various jurisdictions. For example, in South Australia the company engages Etched Communications.\n\nNestlé has over 2000 brands with a wide range of products across a number of markets, including coffee, bottled water, milkshakes and other beverages, breakfast cereals, infant foods, performance and healthcare nutrition, seasonings, soups and sauces, frozen and refrigerated foods, and pet food.\n\nIn late September 2008, the Hong Kong government found melamine in a Chinese-made Nestlé milk product. Six infants died from kidney damage, and a further 860 babies were hospitalised. The Dairy Farm milk was made by Nestlé's division in the Chinese coastal city Qingdao. Nestlé affirmed that all its products were safe and were not made from milk adulterated with melamine. On 2 October 2008, the Taiwan Health ministry announced that six types of milk powders produced in China by Nestlé contained low-level traces of melamine, and were \"removed from the shelves\".\n\nAs of 2013, Nestlé has implemented initiatives to prevent contamination and utilizes what it calls a \"factory and farmers\" model that eliminates the middleman. Farmers bring milk directly to a network of Nestlé-owned collection centers, where a computerized system samples, tests, and tags each batch of milk. To reduce further the risk of contamination at the source, the company provides farmers with continuous training and assistance in cow selection, feed quality, storage, and other areas. In 2014, the company opened the Nestlé Food Safety Institute (NFSI) in Beijing that will help meet China's growing demand for healthy and safe food, one of the top three concerns among Chinese consumers. The NFSI announced it would work closely with authorities to help provide a scientific foundation for food-safety policies and standards, with support to include early management of food-safety issues and collaboration with local universities, research institutes and government agencies on food-safety.\n\nIn an incident in 2015, weevils and fungus were found in Cerelac baby food.\n\nIn June 2009, an outbreak of was linked to Nestlé's refrigerated cookie dough originating in a plant in Danville, Virginia. In the US, it caused sickness in more than 50 people in 30 states, half of whom required hospitalisation. Following the outbreak, Nestlé voluntarily recalled 30,000 cases of the cookie dough. The cause was determined to be contaminated flour obtained from a raw material supplier. When operations resumed, the flour used was heat-treated to kill bacteria.\n\nIn May 2015, Food Safety Regulators from the state of Uttar Pradesh, India found that samples of Nestlé's noodles Maggi had up to 17 times beyond permissible safe limits of lead in addition to monosodium glutamate. On 3 June 2015, New Delhi Government banned the sale of Maggi in New Delhi stores for 15 days because it found lead and monosodium glutamate in the eatable beyond permissible limit. Some of India's biggest retailers like Future Group, Big Bazaar, Easyday, and Nilgiris had imposed a nationwide ban on Maggi as of 3 June 2015. On 3 June 2015, Nestlé India's shares fell down 11% due to the incident. The Gujarat FDA on 4 June 2015, banned the noodles for 30 days after 27 out of 39 samples were detected with objectionable levels of metallic lead, among other things. On 4 June 2015, Nestlé's share fell down by 3% over concerns related to its safety standards. On 5 June 2015, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) orders banned all nine approved variants of Maggi instant noodles from India, terming them \"unsafe and hazardous\" for human consumption. On 5 June 2015 Nepal indefinitely banned Maggi over concerns about lead levels in the product. On 5 June 2015, the Food Safety Agency, United Kingdom launched an investigation to find levels of lead in Maggi. Maggi noodles has been withdrawn in five African nations - Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and South Sudan by a super-market chain after a complaint by the Consumer Federation of Kenya, as a reaction to the ban in India.\n\nAs of August 2015, India's government made public that it was seeking damages of nearly $100 million from Nestlé India for \"unfair trade practices\" following the June ban on Maggi noodles. The 6,400 million rupee suit was filed with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), regarded as the country's top consumer court, but was settled on 13 August 2015. The court ruled that the government ban on the Nestlé product was both \"arbitrary\" and had violated the \"principles of natural justice.\" Although Nestlé was not ordered to pay the fine requested in the government's suit, the court ruled that the Maggi noodle producers must \"send five samples from each batch of Maggi [noodles] for testing to three labs and only if the lead is found to be lower than permitted will they start manufacturing and sale again.\" Although the tests have yet to take place, Nestlé has already destroyed 400 million packets of Maggi products.\n\nIn India, Maggi products were returned to the shelves in November 2015, accompanied by a Nestlé advertising campaign to win back the trust of members of the Indian community. At this time, the \"Maggi anthem\" by Vir Das and Alien Chutney took the nation by storm. Nestlé resumed production of Maggi at all five plants in India on 30 November 2015.\n\nIn 1993, plans were made to update and modernise the overall tone of Walt Disney's EPCOT Center, including a major refurbishment of The Land pavilion. Kraft Foods withdrew its sponsorship on 26 September 1993, with Nestlé taking its place. Co-financed by Nestlé and the Walt Disney World Resort, a gradual refurbishment of the pavilion began on 27 September 1993. In 2003, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of The Land; however, it was under agreement that Nestlé would oversee its own refurbishment to both the interior and exterior of the pavilion. Between 2004 and 2005, the pavilion underwent its second major refurbishment. Nestlé stopped sponsoring The Land in 2009.\n\nOn 5 August 2010, Nestlé and the Beijing Music Festival signed an agreement to extend by three years Nestlé's sponsorship of this international music festival. Nestlé has been an extended sponsor of the Beijing Music Festival for 11 years since 2000. The new agreement will continue the partnership through 2013.\n\nNestlé has partnered the Salzburg Festival in Austria for 20 years. In 2011, Nestlé renewed its sponsorship of the Salzburg Festival until 2015.\n\nTogether, they have created the \"Nestlé and Salzburg Festival Young Conductors Award,\" an initiative that aims to discover young conductors globally and to contribute to the development of their careers.\n\nNestlé's sponsorship of the Tour de France began in 2001 and the agreement was extended in 2004, a move which demonstrated the company's interest in the Tour. In July 2009, Nestlé Waters and the organisers of the Tour de France announced that their partnership will continue until 2013. The main promotional benefits of this partnership will spread on four key brands from Nestlé's product portfolio: Vittel, Powerbar, Nesquik, or Ricore.\n\nIn 2014, Nestlé Waters sponsored the UK leg of the Tour de France through its Buxton Natural Mineral Water brand.\nIn 2002, Nestlé announced it was main sponsor for the Great Britain Lionesses Women's rugby league team for the team's second tour of Australia with its Munchies product.\n\nOn 27 January 2012, the International Association of Athletics Federations announced that Nestlé will be the main sponsor for the further development of IAAF's Kids' Athletics Programme, which is one of the biggest grassroots development programmes in the world of sports. The five-year sponsorship started in January 2012. On 11 February 2016, Nestlé decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the IAAF's Kids' Athletics Programmes because of doping and corruption allegations against the IAAF. Nestlé followed suit after other large sponsors, including Adidas, also stopped supporting the IAAF.\n\nNestlé supports the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) on a number of nutrition and fitness fronts, funding a Fellowship position in AIS Sports Nutrition; nutrition activities in the AIS Dining Hall; research activities; and the development of education resources for use at the AIS and in the public domain.\n\nA boycott was launched in the United States on 7 July 1977, against the Swiss-based Nestlé corporation. It spread in the United States and expanded into Europe in the early 1980s. It was prompted by concern about Nestlé's \"aggressive marketing\" of breast milk substitutes, particularly in less economically developed countries (LEDCs), largely among the poor. The boycott was officially suspended in the U.S. in 1984, after Nestlé agreed to follow an international marketing code endorsed by the World Health Organization(WHO). The boycott was also ended in the UK by several organisations including the General Synod of the Church of England in July 1994, the Royal College of Midwives in July 1997, and the Methodist Ethical Investment Committee in November 2005 and the Reformed Churches in November 2011 as a result of the company's inclusion in the responsible investment index FTSE4Good Responsible Investment Index.\n\nThe boycott was relaunched in 1989.\n\nSince 2011, Nestlé is the only infant formula manufacturer to have met the 104 criteria on the marketing of breast milk substitutes (FTSE4Good BMS Criteria) of the FTSE4Good Responsible Investment Index. Nestlé's inclusion in the index is based on results of independent and transparent verifications conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers every 18 months. Every year since 2009, Bureau Veritas conducts independent assurance of compliance with the Nestlé Policy and Instructions for Implementation of the WHO International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. Their Assurance Statements are available in the public domain.\n\nIn May 2011, the debate over Nestlé's unethical marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written an open letter to the company. An independent audit of Nestlé's marketing practices in Laos was commissioned by Nestlé and carried out by Bureau Veritas in late 2011. The audit found that \"the requirements of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree are well embedded throughout the business\", but that \"promotional materials in 4% of the retail outlets visited\" violated either the Lao PDR Decree or the WHO Code.\n\nIn May 2011, the debate over Nestlé's unethical marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written an open letter to the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, Bureau Veritas was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina's compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree in Lao PDR. The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a non-conformance, and Bureau Veritas recommended that the Nestlé's Policy and Procedures Manual on the Marketing of breast milk substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the Lao PDR Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization was in the process of developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.\n\nNestlé has been under investigation in China since 2011 over allegations that the company bribed hospital staff to obtain the medical records of patients and push its infant formula to increase sales. This was found to be in violation of a 1995 Chinese regulation that aims to secure the impartiality of medical staff by banning hospitals and academic institutions from promoting instant formula to families. As a consequence, six Nestlé employers were given prison sentences between one and six years.\n\nAt the second World Water Forum in 2000, Nestlé and other corporations persuaded the World Water Council to change its statement so as to reduce access to drinking water from a \"right\" to a \"need\". Nestlé continues to take control of aquifers and bottle their water for profit. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe later changed his statement.\n\nIn 2002, Nestlé demanded that the nation of Ethiopia repay US$6 million of debt to the company at a time when Ethiopia was suffering a severe famine. Nestlé backed down from its demand after more than 8,500 people complained via e-mail to the company about its treatment of the Ethiopian government. The company agreed to re-invest any money it received from Ethiopia back into the country. In 2003, Nestlé agreed to accept an offer of US$1.5 million, and donated the money to three active charities in Ethiopia: the Red Cross, Caritas, and UNHCR.\n\nIn 2005, after the cocoa industry had not met the Harkin–Engel Protocol deadline for certifying that the worst forms of child labour (according to the International Labour Organization's Convention 182) had been eliminated from cocoa production, the International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit in 2005 under the Alien Tort Claims Act against Nestlé and others on behalf of three Malian children. The suit alleged the children were trafficked to Ivory Coast, forced into slavery, and experienced frequent beatings on a cocoa plantation. In September 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California determined corporations cannot be held liable for violations of international law and dismissed the suit. The case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Nestlé's appeal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.\n\nThe 2010 documentary \"The Dark Side of Chocolate\" brought attention to purchases of cocoa beans from Ivorian plantations that use child slave labour. The children are usually 12 to 15 years old, and some are trafficked from nearby countries. The first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998. In late 2000, a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa in West Africa. Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. In September 2001, Bradley Alford, chairman and CEO of Nestlé USA, signed the Harkin–Engel Protocol (commonly called the Cocoa Protocol), an international agreement aimed at ending child labour in the production of cocoa.\n\nA major study of the issue in 2016, published in Fortune Magazine in the U.S., concluded that approximately 2.1 million children in [several countries of] West Africa \"still do the dangerous and physically taxing work of harvesting cocoa\". The report was doubtful as to whether the situation can be improved significantly: \n\n\"According to the 2015 edition of the Cocoa Barometer, a biennial report examining the economics of cocoa that’s published by a consortium of nonprofits, the average farmer in Ghana in the 2013–14 growing season made just 84¢ per day, and farmers in Ivory Coast a mere 50¢. That puts them well below the World Bank’s new $1.90 per day standard for extreme poverty, even if you factor in the 13% rise in the price of cocoa last year.\n\nAnd in that context the challenge of eradicating child labor feels immense, and the chocolate companies’ newfound commitment to expanding the investments in cocoa communities not quite sufficient. ... \n'Best-case scenario, we’re only doing 10% of what’s needed.' Getting that other 90% won’t be easy. 'It’s such a colossal issue,' says Sona Ebai, the former secretary general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries. 'I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it’s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector.'He pauses, taking in his own thought for a moment. 'And there, you really need leadership.'\"\nThe 2014 Assessments of Shared Hazelnut Supply Chain In Turkey, published by the Fair Labor Association, identified \"a total of 46 child workers younger than 15 years\" as well as \"a total of 83 young workers (between 15 and 18 years of age) working the same hours as adults and performing similar hazardous and strenuous tasks, such as carrying heavy bags of hazelnuts weighing up to 70 kilograms\".\n\nIn Canada, the Competition Bureau raided the offices of Nestlé Canada (along with those of Hershey Canada and Mars Canada) in 2007 to investigate the matter of price fixing of chocolates. It is alleged that executives with Nestlé (the maker of KitKat, Coffee Crisp, and Big Turk) colluded with competitors in Canada to inflate prices.\n\nThe Bureau alleged that competitors' executives met in restaurants, coffee shops, and at conventions, and that Nestlé Canada CEO, Robert Leonidas, once handed a competitor an envelope containing his company's pricing information, saying: \"I want you to hear it from the top – I take my pricing seriously.\"\n\nNestlé and the other companies were subject to class-action lawsuits for price fixing after the raids were made public in 2007. Nestlé settled for $9 million, without admitting liability, subject to court approval in the new year. A massive class-action lawsuit continues in the United States.\n\nA coalition of environmental groups filed a complaint against Nestlé to the Advertising Standards of Canada after Nestlé took out full-page advertisements in October 2008 claiming, \"Most water bottles avoid landfill sites and are recycled\", \"Nestlé Pure Life is a healthy, eco-friendly choice\", and, \"Bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.\" A spokesperson from one of the environmental groups stated: \"For Nestlé to claim that its bottled water product is environmentally superior to any other consumer product in the world is not supportable.\" In their 2008 Corporate Citizenship Report, Nestlé themselves stated that many of their bottles end up in the solid-waste stream, and that most of their bottles are not recycled. The advertising campaign has been called greenwashing. Nestlé defended its ads, saying they will show they have been truthful in their campaign.\n\nConsiderable controversy has surrounded Nestlé's bottled water brand Arrowhead sourced from wells alongside a spring in Millard Canyon situated in a Native American Reservation at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains in California. While corporate officials and representatives of the governing Morongo tribe have asserted that the company, which started its operations in 2000, is providing meaningful jobs in the area and that the spring is sustaining current surface water flows, a number of local citizen groups and environmental action committees have started to question the amount of water drawn in the light of the ongoing drought, and the restrictions that have been placed on residential water use. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that representatives of the Forest Service failed to follow through on a review process for Nestlé's permit to draw water from the San Bernardino wells, which expired in 1988. In San Bernardino Nestlé pays the U.S. Forest Service $524 yearly to pump and bottle about 30 million gallons, even during droughts. Peter Gleick, a co-founder of the Pacific Institute, that has focused on water issues remarks, “Every gallon of water that is taken out of a natural system for bottled water is a gallon of water that doesn’t flow down a stream, that doesn’t support a natural ecosystem,” he says. “Our public agencies have dropped the ball,”\n\nThe former forest supervisor Gene Zimmerman has explained that the review process was rigorous, and that the Forest Service \"didn't have the money or the budget or the staff\" to follow through on the review of Nestlé's long-expired permit. However, Zimmerman's observations and action have come under scrutiny for a number of reasons. Firstly, along with the natural resource manager for Nestlé, Larry Lawrence, Zimmerman is a board member for and played a vital role in the founding of the nonprofit Southern California Mountains Foundation, of which Nestlé is the most noteworthy and longtime donor. Secondly, the Zimmerman Community Partnership Award – an award inspired by Zimmerman's actions and efforts \"to create a public/private partnership for resource development and community engagement\" – was presented by the foundation to Nestlé's Arrowhead Water division in 2013. Finally, while Zimmerman retired from his former role in 2005, he currently works as a paid consultant for Nestlé, leading many investigative journalists to question Zimmerman's allegiances prior to his retirement from the Forest Service.\n\nIn April 2015, the city of Cascade Locks, Oregon and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is using water for a salmon hatchery, applied with the Oregon Water Resources Department to permanently trade their water rights to Nestlé; an action which does not require a public-interest review. Nestlé approached them in 2008 and they had been considering to trade their well water with Oregon's Oxbow Springs water, a publicly owned water source in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and to sell the spring water at over 100 million gallons of water per year to Nestlé. The plan has been criticized by legislators and 80,000 citizens. The 250,000-square-foot, $50 million Nestlé bottling plant in Cascade Locks with an unemployment rate of 18.8 percent would have 50 employees and would increase property-tax collections by 67 percent. In May 2016, voters of Hood River County voted 69 percent to 31 percent for the ballot measure to ban large bottling operations in the area, but in Cascade Locks, the one precinct in Hood River County, voters decided against the ballot measure, 58 percent to 42 percent. As a result, the Cascade Locks city council voted 5-to-1 to keep up the fight. Soon after, Governor Kate Brown directed state officials to stop an exchange of water rights that was crucial to the deal, citing fiscal rather than environmental reasons. Nestlé then acknowledged that the exchange \"will not be going forward\", marking a definite end to the planned bottling operation.\n\nAlthough a 2005 court settlement gave Nestlé the right to pump 250 gallons per minute (GPM) from a well in unincorporated Osceola Township, Osceola County, Michigan, Nestlé has tried to increase that rate to 400 GPM. Its bottled water is sold under the Ice Mountain Spring label. The local planning commission denied the application to build a booster station to increase the capacity of the pipeline that delivers water to a water truck depot some distance from the town. Local citizens mounted considerable grassroots opposition to the plan, with 55 opponents testifying against the proposal at a meeting attended by almost 500 people in July 2017. The litigation has been costly to the small town, which receives its only compensation from a $200 annual pumping fee. Regarding the 1976 Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act, section 17, a measure precipitated by Nestlé's previous demands, Bill Cobbs, a current Democratic gubernatorial candidate said, \"This is wrong -- when this act was written in 1976 it was never intentioned that water would be up for sale.\" The \"David vs. Goliath\" situation is drawing increasing national attention. Nestlé approaches water purely as a commodity. In 1994 Helmut Maucher, Nestlé's CEO commented, “Springs are like petroleum. You can always build a chocolate factory. But springs you have or you don’t have.” His successor, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, was criticized when, in a 2005 documentary, he similarly promoted and rationalized the commodification of water, saying: “One perspective held by various NGOs—which I would call extreme—is that water should be declared a human right.\n\nIn August 2015, the Ukrainian TV channel Ukrayina refused to hire a worker of the weekly magazine \"Krayina\", Alla Zheliznyak, as a host of a cooking show because she speaks Ukrainian. The demand to only hire a Russian-speaking host was allegedly set by a sponsor of the show – Nesquik, which is a brand of Nestlé S.A. Activists of the Vidsich civil movement held a rally near the office of the company in Kiev, accusing Nestlé of discriminating against people who speak Ukrainian and supporting the Russification of Ukraine. They also added that goods sold in Ukraine are manufactured in Russia. Activists threatened to start a boycott campaign against Nestlé if they will not fulfill their requirements. In September 2015, there were \"Russian kills!\" flashmobs protesting against Nestlé products that are manufactured in Russia.\n\nAt the conclusion of a year-long self-imposed investigation in November 2015, Nestlé disclosed that seafood products sourced in Thailand were produced with forced labour. Nestlé is not a major purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia, but does some business in Thailand – primarily for its Purina cat food. The study found virtually all U.S. and European companies buying seafood from Thailand are exposed to the same risks of abuse in their supply chains. This type of disclosure was a surprise to many in the industry because international companies rarely acknowledge abuses in supply chains.\n\nNestlé was expected to launch a year-long program in 2016 focused on protecting workers across its supply chain. The company has promised to impose new requirements on all potential suppliers, train boat owners and captains about human rights, and hire auditors to check for compliance with new rules.\n\nIn September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Nestlé and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world's two largest cocoa producers.\n\nThe report documents how in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies’ laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country's elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200-400.\n\nNestlé efforts relating to social responsibility programs include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bergeron claimed to have invented the Mai Tai in 1944 at his restaurant, Trader Vic's, in Oakland, California. Trader Vic's forerunner, Donn Beach, claimed to have instead first created it in 1933, although a longtime colleague said that Beach was actually just alleging that the Mai Tai was based on his Q.B. Cooler cocktail. Don the Beachcomber's recipe is more complex than that of Vic's and some believe tastes quite different. Others believe that despite the difference in ingredients that they taste quite similar.\n\nThe name was allegedly taken from \"maita'i\", the Tahitian word for \"good\" or \"excellence\", although the drink is usually spelled as two words, sometimes hyphenated or capitalized.\n\nMost current recipes for Mai Tais based on Trader Vic's 1944 recipe include rum, lime juice, orgeat syrup, and orange liqueur (typically orange curaçao). Variants may include the addition of falernum, bitters, grenadine, orange and grapefruit juices, and so on. Various books from Victor Bergeron described using rum from Jamaica as well as from Martinique, which in modern usage is a Rhum Agricole. As noted in Smuggler's Cove from Martin Cate and Rebecca Cate, the Martinique rums used by Bergeron in the 1950s were most certainly not agricole rums. Overproof rums are sometimes added to make stronger versions, but Cate says references to such use as being from \"the old way\" was only because a 151 proof demerera float was the preferred variation of a frequent elderly customer.\n\nThe Mai Tai became such a popular cocktail in the 1950s–60s that many restaurants, particularly tiki-themed restaurants or bars, served them. The Mai Tai was also prominently featured in the Elvis Presley film \"Blue Hawaii\".\n\nToday, the Mai Tai is synonymous with Tiki culture both past and present.\n\nAs of 2008, Trader Vic's Restaurant chain began to open small establishments called Mai Tai Bars that primarily serve cocktails and \"pupus\" (appetizers).\n\n"}
{"id": "162321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162321", "title": "Invariant mass", "text": "Invariant mass\n\nThe invariant mass, rest mass, intrinsic mass, proper mass, or in the case of bound systems simply mass, is the portion of the total mass of an object or system of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system. More precisely, it is a characteristic of the system's total energy and momentum that is the same in all frames of reference related by Lorentz transformations. If a center-of-momentum frame exists for the system, then the invariant mass of a system is equal to its total mass in that \"rest frame\". In other reference frames, where the system's momentum is nonzero, the total mass (a.k.a. relativistic mass) of the system is greater than the invariant mass, but the invariant mass remains unchanged.\n\nDue to mass–energy equivalence, the rest energy of the system is simply the invariant mass times the speed of light squared. Similarly, the total energy of the system is its total (relativistic) mass times the speed of light squared.\n\nSystems whose four-momentum is a null vector (for example a single photon or many photons moving in exactly the same direction) have zero invariant mass, and are referred to as \"massless\". A physical object or particle moving faster than the speed of light would have space-like four-momenta (such as the hypothesized tachyon), and these do not appear to exist. Any time-like four-momentum possesses a reference frame where the momentum (3-dimensional) is zero, which is a center of momentum frame. In this case, invariant mass is positive and is referred to as the rest mass.\n\nIf objects within a system are in relative motion, then the invariant mass of the whole system will differ from the sum of the objects' rest masses. This is also equal to the total energy of the system divided by \"c\". See mass–energy equivalence for a discussion of definitions of mass. Since the mass of systems must be measured with a weight or mass scale in a center of momentum frame in which the entire system has zero momentum, such a scale always measures the system's invariant mass. For example, a scale would measure the kinetic energy of the molecules in a bottle of gas to be part of invariant mass of the bottle, and thus also its rest mass. The same is true for massless particles in such system, which add invariant mass and also rest mass to systems, according to their energy.\n\nFor an isolated \"massive\" system, the center of mass of the system moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal velocity (with a velocity depending on the reference frame used to view it). Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being \"at rest\" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which exists under these assumptions, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by . This total energy in the center of momentum frame, is the minimum energy which the system may be observed to have, when seen by various observers from various inertial frames.\n\nNote that for reasons above, such a rest frame does not exist for single photons, or rays of light moving in one direction. When two or more photons move in different directions, however, a center of mass frame (or \"rest frame\" if the system is bound) exists. Thus, the mass of a system of several photons moving in different directions is positive, which means that an invariant mass exists for this system even though it does not exist for each photon.\n\nBecause the invariant mass includes the mass of any kinetic and potential energies which remain in the center of momentum frame, the invariant mass of a system can be greater than sum of rest masses of its separate constituents. For example, rest mass and invariant mass are zero for individual photons even though they may add mass to the invariant mass of systems. For this reason, invariant mass is in general not an additive quantity (although there are a few rare situations where it may be, as is the case when massive particles in a system without potential or kinetic energy can be added to a total mass).\n\nConsider the simple case of two-body system, where object A is moving towards another object B which is initially at rest (in any particular frame of reference). The magnitude of invariant mass of this two-body system (see definition below) is different from the sum of rest mass (i.e. their respective mass when stationary). Even if we consider the same system from center-of-momentum frame, where net momentum is zero, the magnitude of the system's invariant mass is not equal to the sum of the rest masses of the particles within it.\n\nThe kinetic energy of such particles and the potential energy of the force fields increase the total energy above the sum of the particle rest masses, and both terms contribute to the invariant mass of the system. The sum of the particle kinetic energies as calculated by an observer is smallest in the center of momentum frame (again, called the \"rest frame\" if the system is bound).\n\nThey will often also interact through one or more of the fundamental forces, giving them a potential energy of interaction, possibly negative.\n\nFor an isolated \"massive\" system, the center of mass moves in a straight line with a steady sub-luminal velocity. Thus, an observer can always be placed to move along with it. In this frame, which is the center of momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, and the system as a whole may be thought of as being \"at rest\" if it is a bound system (like a bottle of gas). In this frame, which always exists, the invariant mass of the system is equal to the total system energy (in the zero-momentum frame) divided by .\n\nIn particle physics, the invariant mass is equal to the mass in the rest frame of the particle, and can be calculated by the particle's energy  and its momentum  as measured in \"any\" frame, by the energy–momentum relation:\n\nor in natural units where ,\n\nThis invariant mass is the same in all frames of reference (see also special relativity). This equation says that the invariant mass is the pseudo-Euclidean length of the four-vector , calculated using the relativistic version of the Pythagorean theorem which has a different sign for the space and time dimensions. This length is preserved under any Lorentz boost or rotation in four dimensions, just like the ordinary length of a vector is preserved under rotations. In quantum theory the invariant mass is a parameter in the relativistic Dirac equation for an elementary particle. The Dirac quantum operator corresponds to the particle four-momentum vector.\n\nSince the invariant mass is determined from quantities which are conserved during a decay, the invariant mass calculated using the energy and momentum of the decay products of a single particle is equal to the mass of the particle that decayed.\nThe mass of a system of particles can be calculated from the general formula:\n\nwhere\n\nThe term invariant mass is also used in inelastic scattering experiments. Given an inelastic reaction with total incoming energy larger than the total detected energy (i.e. not all outgoing particles are detected in the experiment), the invariant mass (also known as the \"missing mass\") of the reaction is defined as follows (in natural units):\n\nIf there is one dominant particle which was not detected during an experiment, a plot of the invariant mass will show a sharp peak at the mass of the missing particle.\n\nIn those cases when the momentum along one direction cannot be measured (i.e. in the case of a neutrino, whose presence is only inferred from the missing energy) the Transverse mass is used.\n\nIn a two-particle collision (or a two-particle decay) the square of the invariant mass (in natural units) is\n\nThe invariant mass of a system made of two massless particles whose momenta form an angle formula_8\nhas a convenient expression:\n\nIn particle collider experiments, one often defines the angular position of a particle in terms of an azimuthal angle formula_9 and pseudorapidity formula_10. Additionally the transverse momentum, formula_11, is usually measured. In this case if the particles are massless, or highly relativistic ( formula_12,) then the invariant mass becomes:\n\nThe rest energy formula_13 of a particle is defined as:\n\nwhere formula_15 is the speed of light in vacuum. In general, only differences in energy have physical significance.\n\nThe concept of rest energy follows from the special theory of relativity that leads to Einstein's famous conclusion about equivalence of energy and mass. See background for mass–energy equivalence.\n\nOn the other hand, the concept of the equivalent Dirac invariant rest mass may be defined in terms of the self energy corresponding to the product of a geometric matter current and a generalized potential as part of a single definition of mass in a geometric unified theory.\n\n\n"}

Like the Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian word \"Tsar\", it is directly derived from the Roman emperors' title of Caesar, which in turn is derived from the personal name of a branch of the \"gens\" (clan) Julia, to which Gaius Julius Caesar, the forebear of the first imperial family, belonged. Although the British monarchs styled \"Emperor of India\" were also called \"Kaisar-i-Hind\" in Hindi and Urdu, this word, although ultimately sharing the same Latin origin, is derived from the (\"kaisar\"), not the German \"Kaiser\".\n\nIn English, the term \"the \"Kaiser\"\" is usually reserved for the emperors of the German Empire and the emperors of the Austrian Empire. During the First World War, anti-German sentiment was at its zenith; the term \"Kaiser\"—especially as applied to Wilhelm II of Germany—thus gained considerable negative connotations in English-speaking countries.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperors (962–1806) called themselves \"Kaiser\", combining the imperial title with that of \"King of the Romans\" (assumed by the designated heir before the imperial coronation); they saw their rule as a continuation of that of the Roman Emperors and used the title derived from the title \"Caesar\" to reflect their supposed heritage.\nIn 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, but the title of \"Kaiser\" was retained by the House of Habsburg, the head of which, beginning in 1804, bore the title of Emperor (\"Kaiser\") of Austria. After 1438, the Habsburgs had provided most of Holy Roman Emperors, so they saw themselves as legitimate heirs to the title they adopted. Despite Habsburg ambitions however, the Austrian Empire could no longer claim to rule over most of Germany, although they did rule over large areas of lands inhabited by non-Germans in addition to Austria. There were four \"Kaisers\" of the Austrian Empire who all belonged to the Habsburg dynasty. \n\nWith the Unification of Germany (aside from Austria) in 1871, there was some debate about the exact title for the monarch of those German territories (such as free imperial cities, principalities, duchies, and kingdoms) that agreed to unify under the leadership of Prussia, thereby forming the new German Empire. The first \"Kaiser\" himself preferred either \"Kaiser von Deutschland\" (\"Emperor of Germany\") or \"Kaiser der Deutschen\" (\"Emperor of the Germans\"). In the end, his chancellor Bismarck's choice \"Deutscher Kaiser\" (\"German Emperor\") was adopted as it simply connoted that the new emperor, hearkening from Prussia, was a German, but did not imply that this new emperor had dominion over all German territories, especially since the Austrian \"Kaiser\" would have been offended as Austria, inhabited by Germans, was still considered part of the German lands. There were only three \"Kaisers\" of the (second) German Empire. All of them belonged to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which, as kings of Prussia, had been \"de facto\" leaders of lesser Germany (Germany excluding Austria).\n\nIn English, the (untranslated) word \"Kaiser\" is mainly associated with the emperors of the unified German Empire (1871–1918). \n\nThe \"Kaisers\" of the Austrian Empire (1804–1918) were:\n\nThe \"Kaisers\" of the German Empire (1871–1918) were:\n\nGeorg Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, is currently head of the House of Hohenzollern, which was the former ruling dynasty of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia.

Used as a verb, \"to calque\" means to borrow a word or phrase from another language while translating its components, so as to create a new lexeme in the target language.\n\n\"Calque\" itself is a loanword from the French noun \"calque\" (\"tracing; imitation; close copy\"); the verb \"calquer\" means \"to trace; to copy, to imitate closely\"; \"papier calque\" is \"tracing paper\". The word \"loanword\" is itself a calque of the German word \"Lehnwort\", just as \"loan translation\" is a calque of \"Lehnübersetzung\".\n\nProving that a word is a calque sometimes requires more documentation than does an untranslated loanword because, in some cases, a similar phrase might have arisen in both languages independently. This is less likely to be the case when the grammar of the proposed calque is quite different from that of the borrowing language, or when the calque contains less obvious imagery.\n\nCalquing is distinct from phono-semantic matching. While calquing includes semantic translation, it does not consist of phonetic matching (i.e. retaining the approximate sound of the borrowed word through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existing word or morpheme in the target language).\n\nOne system classifies calques into five groups:\n\n\nThis terminology is not universal. Some authors call a morphological calque a \"morpheme-by-morpheme translation\".\n\nOther linguists refer to the phonological calque, where the pronunciation of a word is imitated in the other language. For example, the English word \"\"radar\"\" becomes the similar-sounding Chinese word \"\"雷达\"\" (pinyin \"\"léi dá\"\").\n\nLoan blends or partial calques translate some parts of a compound, but not others. For example, the name of the Irish digital television service Saorview is a partial calque of that of the UK service Freeview, translating the first half of the word from English to Irish but leaving the second half unchanged. Other examples are: \"liverwurst\" (< German \"Leberwurst\"), \"apple strudel\" (< German \"Apfelstrudel\").\n\nThe common English phrase \"flea market\" is a loan translation of the French \"\"marché aux puces\"\" (\"market with fleas\").

{"id": "164311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164311", "title": "Falafel", "text": "Falafel\n\nFalafel (or felafel) (, ; , , dialectal: ) is a deep-fried ball, or a flat or doughnut-shaped patty, made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or both. Herbs, spices, and onion relatives are commonly added to the dough. It is a Levantine and Egyptian dish that most likely originated in Egypt, but is commonly eaten throughout Western Asia. The fritters are now found around the world as part of vegetarian cuisine, and as a form of street food.\n\n\"Falafel balls\" are commonly served in a \"pita\", which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as \"taboon\". \"Falafel\" frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich prepared in this way: the falafel \"balls\" are typically laid over a bed of salad or pickled vegetables, and drizzled with hot sauce or a tahini-based sauce. Falafel \"balls\" may also be eaten alone as a snack, or served as part of an assortment of appetizers known as a meze.\n\nThe English word \"falafel\" or \"felafel\" is a loanword from the Levantine Arabic \"falāfil\" (). It may come from the plural of the earlier \"filfal\" (), possibly from Persian \"pilpil\", from Sanskrit \"pippalī\" \"long pepper\", or from the Aramaic \"pilpāl\", meaning a small round thing or a peppercorn, from \"palpēl\", to be round, to roll. It has been found as a foreign-language term in an English publication as early as 1941, though the Oxford English Dictionary gives its earliest attestation in 1951.\n\nOne Coptic dictionary speculates a Coptic origin via the unattested phrase \"*pha la phel\" (ⲫⲁⲓ ⲗⲁⲫⲉⲗ), meaning \"that which has lots of beans\". However, there is no historical record of this being used, and the \"Coptic Etymological Dictionary\" does not contain an entry for the word.\n\nFalafel is also known as \"taʿamiya\" ( ', ) in many parts of Egypt; the word is derived from a diminutive form of the Classical Arabic word ' (, \"food\"); the particular form indicates \"a unit\" of the given root in this case \"\" (, having to do with taste and food), thus meaning \"a little piece of food\" or \"small tasty thing\". Nevertheless, in Alexandria, it is called \"falafel\".\n\nThe word \"falafel\" can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them.\n\nThe origin of falafel is controversial. A widely held theory is that the dish was invented in Egypt about 1000 years ago by Coptic Christians, who ate it as a replacement for meat during Lent. As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans. It has been speculated, with no concrete evidence, that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt. Other theories propose that it came from the Indian subcontinent, where deep-frying was common, and brought west by Arabs or Turks; or that the chickpea-based food came from Yemen.\nFalafel grew to become a common form of street food or fast food in much of the Middle East, especially in the Levant and Egypt. The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze. During Ramadan, falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the \"iftar\", the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset. Falafel became so popular that McDonald's for a time served a \"McFalafel\" in its breakfast menu all over Egypt. Falafel is still popular with Egyptians, who eat it on a daily basis along with ful medames and even cook large volumes during religious holidays.\nDebates over the origin of falafel have sometimes devolved into political discussions about the relationship between Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish in Egypt, also in Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for what they see as the appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association attempted to claim Protected Designated Origin status, partly to prevent Israeli use of the word.\n\nFalafel plays an iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely considered to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals.\n\nIn North America, prior to the 1970s, falafel was found only in Middle Eastern and Jewish neighborhoods and restaurants. Today, the dish is a common and popular street food in many cities throughout North America.\n\nGermany has seen an increase in the popularity of falafel since the last decades of the 20th century. In Berlin, the areas of the former West Berlin play a special role, as they host a comparatively large Arab community. However, falafel shops have been located mainly in areas undergoing gentrification, rather than being chiefly part of an Arab subculture. While the operators are usually Arabs, the customers are predominantly middle-class Germans. Some restaurants associated with the thriving Jewish and Israeli community in Berlin also serve falafel.\n\nFalafel restaurants sometimes feature Middle-Eastern decor meant to give an impression of exotic authenticity. However, the food has been adapted. For example, a unique sweet mango sauce is used in place of the sour-salty \"amba\" found in the Middle East, and take-away sandwiches in pita bread typically contain assorted vegetables, pickles, and sauces, in contrast to simpler Middle-Eastern presentations.\n\nFalafel has become popular among vegetarians and vegans, as an alternative to meat-based street foods, and is now sold in packaged mixes in health-food stores. While often used to make veggie burgers, it has become more widely used as a source of protein. In the United States, falafel's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf, sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes.\n\nFalafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas. The use of chickpeas is predominant in most Middle Eastern countries, such as Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria. This version is the most popular in the West. In Egypt, fava beans, chickpeas, or often a combination of the two may be used.\n\nWhen chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with baking soda) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, scallions, and garlic. Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor. The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek, parsley, green coriander, cumin and dry coriander. The mixture is shaped into balls or patties. This can be done by hand or with a tool called an \"aleb falafel\" (falafel mould). The mixture is usually deep fried, or it can be oven baked.\n\nWhen not served alone, falafel is often served with flat or unleavened bread, such as wrapped within lafa or stuffed in a hollow pita. Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and other garnishes, such as pickles can be added. Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini.\n\nFalafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes, particularly doughnut-shaped. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan.\n\nWhen made with chickpeas, falafel is high in protein, complex carbohydrates, and fiber. Key nutrients are calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin C, thiamine, pantothenic acid, vitamin B, and folate. Phytochemicals include beta-carotene. Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which has been shown to be effective in lowering blood cholesterol.\n\nChickpeas are low in fat and contain no cholesterol, but a considerable amount of fat is absorbed during the frying process. Falafel can be baked to reduce the high fat content associated with frying.\n\nThe current record, 74.75 kg (164.4 lb), was set on 28 July 2012 in Amman, Jordan by the Landmark hotel. Using a standard recipe, 10 chefs prepared the 130 cm diameter falafel ball.\n\nThe record, 5,173 kg (11,404 lb 8 oz), was set by Chef Ramzi Choueiri and the students of Al-Kafaat University (Lebanon) in Beirut on 9 May 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "164331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164331", "title": "Cauliflower", "text": "Cauliflower\n\nCauliflower is one of several vegetables in the species \"Brassica oleracea\" in the genus \"Brassica\", which is in the family Brassicaceae. It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed. Typically, only the head is eaten – the edible white flesh sometimes called \"curd\" (with a similar appearance to cheese curd). The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds as the edible portion. \"Brassica oleracea\" also includes broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, collard greens, and kale, collectively called \"cole\" crops, though they are of different cultivar groups.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, Pliny included what he called \"cyma\" among his descriptions of cultivated plants in \"Natural History\": \"\"Ex omnibus brassicae generibus suavissima est cyma,\"\" (\"Of all the varieties of cabbage the most pleasant-tasted is \"cyma\"\"). Pliny's descriptions likely refer to the flowering heads of an earlier cultivated variety of \"Brassica oleracea\", but comes close to describing modern cauliflower. In the Middle Ages early forms of cauliflower were associated with the island of Cyprus, with the Arab botanists Ibn al-'Awwam and Ibn al-Baitar, in the 12th and 13th centuries claiming its origins were Cyprus. This association continued into Western Europe, where cauliflowers were sometimes known as Cyprus colewart, and there was extensive trade in western Europe in cauliflower seeds from Cyprus, under the French Lusignan rulers of the island, until well into the sixteenth century.\n\nFrançois Pierre La Varenne employed \"chouxfleurs\" in \"Le cuisinier françois\". They were introduced to France from Genoa in the 16th century, and are featured in Olivier de Serres' \"Théâtre de l'agriculture\" (1600), as \"cauli-fiori\" \"as the Italians call it, which are still rather rare in France; they hold an honorable place in the garden because of their delicacy\", but they did not commonly appear on grand tables until the time of Louis XIV. It was introduced to India in 1822 from England by the British.\n\nThe word \"cauliflower\" derives from the Italian \"cavolfiore\", meaning \"cabbage flower\". The ultimate origin of the name is from the Latin words \"caulis\" (cabbage) and \"flōs\" (flower).\n\nCauliflower is relatively difficult to grow compared to cabbage, with common problems such as an underdeveloped head and poor curd quality.\n\nAs weather is a limiting factor for producing cauliflower, the plant grows best in cool daytime temperatures , with plentiful sun, and moist soil conditions high in organic matter and sandy soils. The earliest maturity possible for cauliflower is 7 to 12 weeks from transplanting. In the northern hemisphere, fall season plantings in July may enable harvesting before autumn frost.\n\nLong periods of sun exposure in hot summer weather may cause cauliflower heads to discolor with a red-purple hue.\n\nTransplantable cauliflowers can be produced in containers as flats, hotbeds, or in the field. In soil that is loose, well-drained and fertile, field seedlings are shallow-planted and thinned by ample space (about 12 plants per . Ideal growing temperatures are about when seedlings are 25 to 35 days old. Applications of fertilizer to developing seedlings begin when leaves appear, usually with a starter solution weekly.\n\nTransplanting to the field normally begins late spring and may continue until mid-summer. Row spacing is about . \nRapid vegetative growth after transplanting may benefit from such procedures as avoiding spring frosts, using starter solutions high in phosphorus, irrigating weekly, and applying fertilizer.\n\nThe most important disorders affecting cauliflower quality are a hollow stem, stunted head growth or buttoning, ricing, browning and leaf-tip burn. Among major pests affecting cauliflower are aphids, root maggots, cutworms, moths, and flea beetles. The plant is susceptible to black rot, black leg, club root, black leaf spot, and downy mildew.\n\nWhen cauliflower is mature, heads appear as clear white, compact, and in diameter, and should be cooled shortly after harvest. Forced air cooling to remove heat from the field during hot weather may be needed for optimal preservation. Short-term storage is possible using cool, high-humidity storage conditions.\n\nThere are four major groups of cauliflower.\n\n\nThere are hundreds of historic and current commercial varieties used around the world. A comprehensive list of about 80 North American varieties is maintained at North Carolina State University.\n\n\nIn 2016, global production of cauliflowers (combined for production reports with broccoli) was 25.2 million tonnes, led by China and India which, combined, had 73% of the world total. Secondary producers, having 0.4–1.3 million tonnes annually, were the United States, Spain, Mexico and Italy.\n\n100 grams of raw white cauliflower provides 25 calories, is low in fat, carbohydrates, dietary fiber and protein (table). It has a high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C and moderate levels (10-19% DV) of several B vitamins and vitamin K (table).\n\nCauliflower contains several phytochemicals, common in the cabbage family, that are under preliminary research for their potential properties, including isothiocyanates and glucosinolates.\n\nBoiling reduces the levels of cauliflower compounds, with losses of 20–30% after five minutes, 40–50% after ten minutes, and 75% after thirty minutes. However, other preparation methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on the compounds.\n\nCauliflower heads can be roasted, grilled, boiled, fried, steamed, pickled, or eaten raw. When cooking, the outer leaves and thick stalks are typically removed, leaving only the florets (the edible \"curd\" or \"head\"). The leaves are also edible, but are most often discarded. The florets should be broken into similar-sized pieces so they are cooked evenly. After eight minutes of steaming, or five minutes of boiling, the florets should be soft, but not mushy (depending on size). Stirring while cooking can break the florets into smaller, uneven pieces.\n\nCauliflower has been noticed by mathematicians for its distinct fractal dimension, calculated to be roughly 2.8.\nOne of the fractal properties of cauliflower is that every branch, or \"module\", is similar to the entire cauliflower. Another quality, also present in other plant species, is that the angle between \"modules,\" as they become more distant from the center, is 360 degrees divided by the golden ratio.\n\n"}
{"id": "164372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164372", "title": "Croissant", "text": "Croissant\n\nA croissant (; , ; ) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.\n\nCrescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian and French bakeries and pâtisseries. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, pre-formed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food which can be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissanterie was explicitly a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.\n\nCroissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in France.\n\nThe kipferl, the ancestor of the croissant, has been documented in Austria going back at least as far as the 13th century, in various shapes. The kipferl can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a form of kipferl). Some Egyptians claim, arguably, that the kipferl may have been based on the feteer meshaltet pastry known to the Egyptians.\n\nThe birth of the croissant itself—that is, its adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl, before the invention of viennoiseries—can be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery (\"Boulangerie Viennoise\") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of \"viennoiserie\", a 20th-century term for supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (\"croissant\") shape and has become an identifiable shape across the world.\n\nAlan Davidson, editor of the \"Oxford Companion to Food\", found no printed recipe for the present-day croissant in any French recipe book before the early 20th century; the earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the \"fantasy or luxury breads\" in Payen's \"Des substances alimentaires\", 1853. However, early recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.\n\nZang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in several works of the time: \"This same M. Zank ...founded around 1830 [sic], in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise\". Several sources praise this bakery's products: \"Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise\"; \"which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu\".\n\nBy 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical \"All the Year Round\") of \"the workman's \"pain de ménage\" and the soldier's \"pain de munition\", to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table\"\n\nThe puff pastry technique which now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne's \"Le Cuisinier françois\" gave a recipe for it in the 1680 and possibly earlier, editions. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century.\n\nStories of how the Kipferl — and so, ultimately, the croissant — was created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the 19th century. However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the Kipferl in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.\n\nThe legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the Battle of Tours in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic crescent; that it was invented in Buda; or, according to other sources, in Vienna in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian forces in the siege of the city, as a reference to the crescents on the Ottoman flags, when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm.\n\nThe above-mentioned Alan Davidson proposed that the Islamic origin story originated with 20th-century writer Alfred Gottschalk, who gave two versions, one in the \"Larousse Gastronomique\" and the other in his \"History of Food and Gastronomy\":\n\nThis has led to croissants being banned by some Islamic fundamentalists.\n\nHowever, many in the Arab world hold to an alternate Muslim origin for the croissant. In this account, the croissant is thought to originate from the feteer meshaltet, a flaky, layered pastry known to the Egyptians since the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1292 BCE or earlier). During the Mamluk period (1250–1517 CE), a crescent-shaped variant of feteer meshaltet called \"feteer halali\" (crescent feteer) emerged and spread to Europe and France, where it became known as the croissant.\n\nUncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like \"pain au chocolat\", which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings. It may be flavoured with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other fruits such as apples. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond filling.\nIn the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese, or feta cheese and spinach. In the Levant, croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar. In Germany, croissants are sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye (\"Laugencroissant\"). In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the croissant is typically called a \"Gipfeli\"; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.\n\nCroissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast or \"merienda\", a light mid-morning or mid-afternoon meal. They are referred to as \"medialunas\" (\"half moons\") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (\"medialunas de manteca\", \"half moons of butter\"). Another variant is a \"medialuna de grasa\" (\"half moon of lard\"), which is not always sweet.\n\nA cousin of the croissant is the Italian \"cornetto\" (in the Center and South) or \"brioche\" (in the North). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the \"cornetto vuoto\" (Italian: \"empty cornetto\") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include \"crema pasticciera\" (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They often come covered with powdered sugar or other toppings. \"Cornetto\" with cappuccino at the bar is considered to be the one of the most common breakfasts in Italy.\n\nOn November 11, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in Greater Poland, mainly in its capital city Poznań. On this day, the people of Poznań buy and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called \"rogale świętomarcińskie\" (\"St. Martin's croissants\"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry with a filling made of ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.\n\nThe first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, \"doce de ovo\". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to brioche and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered a sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: \"croissant\") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese pâtisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.\n\nIn many Spanish-speaking countries, a croissant is called a \"cuerno\", meaning \"horn\".\n\nA remote similarity of the croissant shape is the Turkish \"ay çöreği\". It is filled with cinnamon, walnut, hazelnut, cacao and raisin. Its rectangular shape variant is known as \"pastiç\" or \"İzmir çöreği\". It is generally eaten during breakfast or with tea.\n\nThe first step of manufacturing croissants is the \"predough\" formation. To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step. Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other pastries. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19 °C, to best hydrate the ingredients. In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.\n\nThe second step is the lamination process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers. After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16-50 fat layers are obtained. The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.\n\nAfter lamination, the dough is formed into its famous crescent shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.\n\nThe third step is the fermentation process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast which, during proofing, increase the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at 31 °C. The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded two-and-a-half times its original volume.\n\nThe fourth step is the baking process. Also known as \"pastry lift\" or \"dough lift,\" the dough expands as water is converted to steam, thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture. Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10–20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from 165 °C to 205 °C.\n\nThe final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.\n\nGluten proteins affect the water absorption and viscoelastic properties of the predough. The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated glutenin proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated gliadin proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough’s viscosity.\n\nStarch also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent. The slightly swollen granules are found in the spaces between the gluten network, thus contributing to the consistency of the dough. The granules may not be intact, as the process of milling wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency \n\nWater content affects the mechanical behavior of predough. As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the viscosity of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough’s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy. Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter’s incorporation.\n\nIn-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product. As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.\n\nIn laminated croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains less layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers. The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase dough strength and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.\n\nRoll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In laminated dough, fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding. As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.\n\nThe type of roll-in fat used is typically butter or margarine. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil emulsions, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil. While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, 32 °C, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers. On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between 40 °C and 44 °C, at least 3 °C higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift. At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding. If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.\n\nCroissants contain yeast, \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of respiration. This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic fermentation. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Once CO2 saturates the dough’s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing. Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single CO2 molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable \n\nIn order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with steam production. If the yeast overproduces CO2, then the well-defined layers may collapse. During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain less layers than other puff pastries.\n\nDuring baking, the transient gluten network turns into a permanent network. At higher temperatures, intermolecular disulfide bonds form between glutenin molecules, as well as between gliadin and glutenin. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant’s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation’s dough lift.\n\nStarch undergoes gelatinization as a result of baking. Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough’s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, amylopectin crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order. At the same time, starch gelatinization actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of amylose leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.\n\nRoll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking. The fat phase also contributes to dough lift through gas inflation, which will be described next.\n\nWater is converted to steam during the baking process, which is the main factor behind the leavening of the dough. The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam. Although the exact mechanism of steam entrapment is still unclear, it is likely a result of both steam expanding inside each dough layer and steam migrating to oil layers, where it inflates gas bubbles. The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough. As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. It is important to note that during the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.\n\nThe effect of gluten proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.\n\nStarch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. Amylopectin retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more crystalline structure. The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. Starch retrogradation actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.\n\nWater migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from gluten to starch as a result of starch retrogradation. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant. In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous starch fraction and gluten network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture. The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products. As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.\n\nFat also affects the quality of croissants in storage. On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking. This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion. On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant’s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.\n\n"}
{"id": "164556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164556", "title": "Archon", "text": "Archon\n\nArchon (, ἄρχοντες, \"árchontes\") is a Greek word that means \"ruler\", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning \"to be first, to rule\". Derived from the same root are words such as monarch and hierarchy.\n\nIn the early literary period of ancient Greece the chief magistrates of various Greek city states were called \"Archon\". The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging from \"club leader\" to \"master of the tables\" at \"syssitia\" to \"Roman governor\". In Roman terms, \"archontes\" ruled by \"imperium\", whereas \"basileis\" (\"kings\") had \"auctoritas\".\n\nIn Athens a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the \"Archon Eponymos\", the \"Polemarch\", and the \"Archon Basileus\". According to Aristotle's \"Constitution of the Athenians\", the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient calendar systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as \"strategoi\". The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by \"junior Archons\", called \"Thesmothetes\". After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus, though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.\n\nUnder the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed choregai (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays. Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus. The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the \"protagonist\"), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the \"archon eponymos\". The \"archon eponymos\" remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance.\n\nByzantine historians usually described foreign rulers as \"archontes\". The rulers of the Bulgars themselves, along with their own titles, often bear the title \"archon placed by God\" in inscriptions in Greek.\n\nInside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the \"themata\": Dalmatia, Cephalonia, Crete and Cyprus. \"Archontes\" were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous Slavic-inhabited areas (\"sclaviniae\") under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, \"archontes\" are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an archontia (). The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the mint (), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.\n\nThe title of megas archon (\"grand archon\") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as \"grand prince\". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the Palaiologan period, but did not have any specific functions.\n\nFrom time to time, laity of the Orthodox Church in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople have been granted the title of \"Archon\" to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to St Andrew. This \"Archon\" status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .\n\nAn Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the Orthodox Church (at large).\n\nIt is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the Orthodox Church faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with human rights and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.\n\nAs it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.\n\n\"Archon\" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as \"άρχοντας\" (\"archontas)\" to someone that holds a form of status, or power \n\nThe term is used within the Arab-speaking Copts in church parlance as a title for a leading member of the laity.\n\nVarious fraternities and sororities use the title of archon or variations on it.\n\nSome Gnostic sects used this term for demons associated with the planetspheres.\n\n"}

W.\" Post (October 26, 1854 – May 9, 1914) was an American inventor, breakfast cereal and foods manufacturer and a pioneer in the prepared-food industry.\n\nCharles William Post, commonly known as \"C. W.\", was born October 26, 1854 in Springfield, Illinois. He was the son of Charles Rollin Post and the former Caroline Lathrop, and grew up in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States during Post's boyhood years.\n\nPost graduated from the public schools of Springfield and enrolled at Illinois Industrial University (known today as the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign), where he remained two years before leaving without a degree.\n\nAfter a brief stay in Independence, Kansas, Post returned to Springfield, where he remained for over a decade working as a salesman and manufacturer of agricultural machinery. During this interval Post invented and patented several farm implements, including a plow, a harrow, and a hay-stacking machine.\n\nIn November 1874, Post married Ella Letitia Merriweather; they had one daughter. Ella supported her husband throughout his career and cared for him when he was ill. As Post became wealthier and began spending more time away from Ella, who was often ill, he slowly drifted away from her. Against her wishes, Post separated from her in 1904 and married his second wife, Leila Young, his 27 year old secretary, in November 1904. Post's daughter, who remained close to her father, later said that her mother died of \"a broken heart\" after Post divorced her and married his secretary.\n\nPost suffered a mental breakdown in November 1885, the result of the stress and overwork which accompanied his job as a farm implement manufacturer. Post made a break with his previous life, moving to Texas in 1886, where he came into association with a group of real estate developers in Fort Worth, who were attempting to establish a new community on the eastern outskirts of a town called Riverside. In 1888, Post began a real estate development of his own in Fort Worth on that he had obtained, platting the land for streets and homes and constructing two mills.\n\nThe stress of this work again proved too much for Post's constitution, and a second breakdown followed in 1891. Post began a period of extensive travels in search of a cure, coming to take particular interest in the chemistry of digestion. After a period traversing Europe, Post visited the Battle Creek Sanitarium of Battle Creek, Michigan, a facility operated by John Harvey Kellogg. He was inspired to start his own company based upon the dietary products used there.\n\nIn 1895, Post founded Postum Cereal Co., with his first product, Postum cereal beverage. Post's first breakfast cereal premiered in 1897, and he named the product Grape-Nuts cereal because of the fruity aroma noticed during the manufacturing process and the nutty crunch of the finished product. In 1904, he followed up the Grape Nuts label with a brand of corn flakes, which was first called Elijah's Manna before being renamed Post Toasties in 1908.\n\nIn 1906, Post invested some of his substantial earnings from his food products manufacturing into Texas real estate, purchasing a massive tract in Garza and Lynn Counties. Post platted a new town, which he called Post City. Shade trees were planted, farm parcels laid out, and a hotel, school, churches, and a department store were constructed for the new Garza County seat.\n\nIn 1907 \"Collier's Weekly\" published an article questioning the claim made in advertisements for Grape Nuts that it could cure appendicitis. Post responded with advertisements questioning the mental capacity of the article's author, and \"Collier's Weekly\" sued for libel. The case was heard in 1910, and Post was fined $50,000. The decision was overturned on appeal, but advertisements for Postum products stopped making such claims.\n\nPost was a staunch opponent of the trade union movement and was remembered by the National Association of Manufacturers as one who \"opposed bitterly boycotts, strikes, lockouts, picketing and other forms of coercion in the relations between employer and employee.\" Post was also a leading public advocate of the open shop system.\n\nAt the end of 1913, the chronically ill Post's health deteriorated to the point that he canceled public appearances, which prompted speculation in the press regarding his well-being.\n\nIn early March 1914, Post was believed to be suffering from appendicitis and was rushed via a nonstop train from California to Rochester, Minnesota, to be operated on by Dr.\nWilliam and Charles Mayo, regarded as the preeminent surgeons of the day. Upon examination the Mayo brothers deemed Post to be inoperable, however, and the breakfast cereal magnate returned home to Santa Barbara without surgical remedy, still plagued by stomach pain. In the 1995 book \"American Empress: The Life and Times of Marjorie Merriweather Post\", author Nancy Rubin claims that Post did indeed have the Mayo brothers operate successfully sometime between March 5 and 10, 1914.\n\nOn May 9, 1914, despondent over his ongoing stomach illness, Post took his own life with a self-inflicted gunshot. His 27-year-old daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, inherited his company along with most of his vast fortune, one of the largest of the early 20th century .\n\nMarjorie Merriweather Post later married financier E.F. Hutton and owned a estate on Long Island's North Shore called \"Hillwood.\" Marjorie sold the estate in 1951 for $200,000 to Long Island University, which founded its residential C.W. Post College in 1954, marking the 100th anniversary of C. W. Post's birth. For a while named the C.W. Post Center and then the C.W. Post Campus, what was C.W. Post College has now become mainly a commuter campus called LIU/Post, and it has about 8,500 full- and part-time students and over 100,000 alumni.\n\n\n\n"}

It had been known for centuries that a freely suspended compass needle pointed north. Earlier investigators (including Christopher Columbus) found that direction deviated somewhat from true north, and Robert Norman showed the force on the needle was not horizontal but slanted into the Earth.\n\nWilliam Gilbert's explanation was that the Earth itself was a giant magnet, and he demonstrated this by creating a scale model of the magnetic Earth, a \"terrella\", a sphere formed out of a lodestone. Passing a small compass over the terrella, Gilbert demonstrated that a horizontal compass would point towards the magnetic pole, while a dip needle, balanced on a horizontal axis perpendicular to the magnetic one, indicated the proper \"magnetic inclination\" between the magnetic force and the horizontal direction. Gilbert later reported his findings in De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure, published in 1600.\n\nKristian Birkeland was a Norwegian physicist who, around 1895, tried to explain why the lights of the polar aurora appeared only in regions centered at the magnetic poles.\n\nHe simulated the effect by directing cathode rays (later identified as electrons) at a terella in a vacuum tank, and found they indeed produced a glow in regions around the poles of the terrella. Because of residual gas in the chamber, the glow also outlined the path of the particles. Neither he nor his associate Carl Størmer (who calculated such paths) could understand why the actual aurora avoided the area directly above the poles themselves. Birkeland believed the electrons came from the Sun, since large auroral outbursts were associated with sunspot activity.\n\nBirkeland constructed several terrellas. One large terrella experiment was reconstructed in Tromsø, Norway.\n\nThe German Baron Carl Reichenbach (1788–1869) also experimented with a terrella. He used an electromagnet, placed within a large hollow iron sphere, and this was examined in the darkroom under varying degrees of electrification.\n\nBrunberg and Dattner in Sweden, around 1950, used a terrella to simulate trajectories of particles in the Earth's field. Podgorny in the Soviet Union, around 1972, built terrellas at which a flow of plasma was directed, simulating the solar wind. Hafiz-Ur Rahman at the University of California, Riverside conducted more realistic experiments around 1990. All such experiments are difficult to interpret, and are never able to scale all the parameters needed to properly simulate the Earth's magnetosphere, which is why such experiments have now been completely replaced by computer simulations.\n\nRecently the Terrella has been further developed by a team of physicists at the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics in Grenoble, France to create the Planeterrella which uses two magnetised spheres which can be manipulated to recreate several different auroral phenomena.\n\n"}
{"id": "165226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165226", "title": "Minnesang", "text": "Minnesang\n\nMinnesang (, \"love song\") was a tradition of lyric- and song-writing in Germany that flourished in the Middle High German period. This period of medieval German literature began in the 12th century and continued into the 14th. People who wrote and performed were known as Minnesänger (, \"minnesingers\"), and a single song was called a . \n\nThe name derives from \"minne\", the Middle High German word for love, as that was Minnesang's main subject. The \"Minnesänger\" were similar to the Provençal troubadours and northern French \"trouvères\" in that they wrote love poetry in the tradition of courtly love in the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn the absence of reliable biographical information, there has been debate about the social status of the \"\". Some clearly belonged to the higher nobility – the 14th century Codex Manesse includes songs by dukes, counts, kings, and the Emperor Henry VI. Some \"Minnesänger\", as indicated by the title \"Meister\" (master), were clearly educated commoners, such as Meister Konrad von Würzburg. It is thought that many were \"ministeriales\", that is, members of a class of lower nobility, vassals of the great lords. Broadly speaking, the \"Minnesänger\" were writing and performing for their own social class at court, and should be thought of as courtiers rather than professional hired musicians. Friedrich von Hausen, for example, was part of the entourage of Friedrich Barbarossa, and died on crusade. As a reward for his service, Walther von der Vogelweide was given a fief by the Emperor Frederick II.\n\nSeveral of the best known Minnesänger are also noted for their epic poetry, among them Heinrich von Veldeke, Wolfram von Eschenbach and Hartmann von Aue.\n\nThe earliest texts date from perhaps 1150, and the earliest named Minnesänger are Der von Kürenberg and Dietmar von Aist, clearly writing in a native German tradition in the third quarter of the 12th century. This is referred to as the Danubian tradition.\n\nFrom around 1170, German lyric poets came under the influence of the Provençal troubadours and the French \"trouvères\". This is most obvious in the adoption of the strophic form of the \"canzone\", at its most basic a seven-line strophe with the rhyme scheme ab|ab|cxc, and a musical AAB structure, but capable of many variations.\n\nA number of songs from this period match \"trouvère\" originals exactly in form, indicating that the German text could have been sung to an originally French tune, which is especially likely where there are significant commonalities of content. Such songs are termed contrafacta. For example, Friedrich von Hausen's \"Ich denke underwilen\" is regarded as a contrafactum of Guiot de Provins's \"Ma joie premeraine\".\n\nBy around 1190, the German poets began to break free of Franco-Provençal influence. This period is regarded as the period of Classical Minnesang with Albrecht von Johansdorf, Heinrich von Morungen, Reinmar von Hagenau developing new themes and forms, reaching its culmination in Walther von der Vogelweide, regarded both in the Middle Ages and in the present day as the greatest of the Minnesänger.\n\nThe later Minnesang, from around 1230, is marked by a partial turning away from the refined ethos of classical minnesang and by increasingly elaborate formal developments. The most notable of these later \"Minnesänger\", Neidhart von Reuental introduces characters from lower social classes and often aims for humorous effects.\n\nOnly a small number of Minnelied melodies have survived to the present day, mainly in manuscripts dating from the 15th century or later, which may present the songs in a form other than the original one. Additionally, it is often rather difficult to interpret the musical notation used to write them down. Although the contour of the melody can usually be made out, the rhythm of the song is frequently hard to fathom.\n\nThere are a number of recordings of Minnesang using the original melodies, as well as Rock groups such as Ougenweide performing songs with modern instruments.\n\nIn the 15th century, Minnesang developed into and gave way to the tradition of the Meistersänger. The two traditions are quite different, however; Minnesänger were mainly aristocrats, while Meistersänger usually were commoners.\n\nAt least two operas have been written about the Minnesang tradition: Richard Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" and Richard Strauss' \"Guntram\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following love poem, of unknown authorship, is found in a Latin codex of the 12th century from the Tegernsee Abbey.\nThe standard collections are\n\nThere are separate editions of Walther's works, and of a number of the most prolific Minnesänger.

{"id": "166683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166683", "title": "Rebbe", "text": "Rebbe\n\nRebbe (: or ) is a Yiddish word derived from the Hebrew word \"rabbi\", which means \"master\", \"teacher\", or \"mentor\". Like the title \"rabbi\", it refers to teachers of Torah or leaders of Judaism.\n\nIn common parlance of modern times, the phrase \"the Rebbe\" is often used specifically by Hasidim to refer to the leader of their Hasidic movement.\n\nThe Yiddish term \"rebbe\" comes from the Hebrew word \"rabbi\", meaning \"My Master\", which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. It was an honorific originally given to those who had Smicha in the Pharisaic and Talmudic era. Since vowels were not written at the time, it is impossible to know historically whether it was pronounced rah-bee () or r-bee (). The English word \"rabbi\" () comes directly from this form. In Yiddish, the word became \"reb-eh\" ()—now commonly spelled \"rebbe\" (—or just \"reb\" (). The word \"master\" \"\" literally means \"great one\".\n\nThe Sages of the Mishnah known as the \"Tannaim\", from the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era, were known by the title \"Rabbi\" () (for example, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochoy). Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the leader of Jewry in Mishnaic Times, was simply called \"Rabbi\" (), as being the rabbi par excellence of his generation.\n\nThe Sages of the Talmud known as the \"Amoraim\", from the 3rd, 4th and early 5th centuries, those born in the Land of Israel, are called \"Rabbi\" (); those born in the diaspora are known by the title \"Rav\" ().\n\nToday, \"rebbe\" is used in the following ways:\n\nAn ordinary communal rabbi, or \"rebbe\" in Yiddish, is sometimes distinct from a \"rav\" (, also pronounced \"rov\" by Jews of Eastern European or Russian origin), who is a more authoritative halakhic decider. A significant function of a \"rav\" is to answer questions of halakha (corpus of Jewish law), but he is not as authoritative as a \"posek\". The short form \"reb\" is an honorific for Orthodox Jewish men, who are most likely to have profound knowledge of the Talmud and Torah, as opposed to Reconstructionist, Reform or Conservative Judaism. Originally, this title was added to the names of Jews at the time of the schism with the Karaite sect, as a sign of loyalty to the original rabbinic tradition, known today as Orthodox Judaism.\n\nAs a rule, among hasidim, \"rebbe\" () is referred to in Hebrew as \"admor\" (pl. \"admorim\"), an abbreviation for Hebrew \"adoneinu moreinu v'rabeinu\", meaning 'our master, our teacher, and our rabbi', which is now the modern Hebrew word in Israel for \"rebbe\".\n\nHasidim use the term \"rebbe\" () also in a more elevated manner, to denote someone that they perceive not only as the religious leader or \"nasi\" of their congregation, but as their spiritual adviser and mentor. \"The Rebbe\" or \"my Rebbe\" in this sense is a \"rav\" or \"rabbi\" whose views and advice are accepted not only on issues of religious law and practice, but in all arenas of life, including political and social issues. Sometimes a hasid has a \"rebbe\" as his spiritual guide and an additional \"rav\" for rulings on issues of \"halakha\".\n\nHasidim use the concept of a (non-Hasidic) \"rebbe\" in the simple sense of \"rabbi\", as the Yiddish-German equivalent to the Hebrew word \"\" . For example: \"I will ask my rebbe (), Rabbi () Ploni (so-and-so), for advice about this personal matter.\"\n\nA Hasidic rebbe () is generally taken to mean a great leader of a Hasidic dynasty, also referred to as \"Grand Rabbi\" in English or an \"ADMOR\", a Hebrew acronym for \"Adoneinu-Moreinu-veRabbeinu\" (\"our lord/master, teacher, and rabbi\"). Outside of Hasidic circles, the term \"Grand Rabbi\" has been used to refer to a rabbi with a higher spiritual status. The practice became widespread in America in the early 1900s when Hasidic rebbes began to emigrate to the United States, and was derived from the German \"Grossrabbiner\".\n\nRabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, is regarded by Hasidim as the first Hasidic rebbe. During his lifetime he was referred to mainly as \"The holy\" rather than as \"Rebbe\", and his disciples were \"magidim\" or \"preachers\", such as the Magid of Chernobyl or the Magid of Mezritsh.\n\nThe first \"rebbe\" to be known as such was the Baal Shem Tov's grandson, Rabbi Boruch of Mezhibozh, who was referred to as \"The Rebbe\" during his lifetime. After him, those who rose to positions of leadership and their successors began to be called \"rebbe\". The title gradually came to suggest a higher spiritual status.\n\nEach Hasidic group refers to its leader as \"the rebbe\".\n\nHannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir or the \"Ludmirer Moyd\", was the only female rebbe in the history of the Hasidic movement; she lived in the 19th century in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nAccording to Maimonides, a tzadik is \"one whose merit surpasses [his/her] iniquity\", and every person can reach the level of a Tzadik. According to the Tanya, a tzadik has no evil inclination, and only a select few predestined to attain this level can attain it. According to Kabbalah (and particularly the Hasidic understanding of Kabbalah), the world is sustained on the \"shoulders\" of Tzadikim Nistarim, divinely predestined exceptionally righteous people in a generation. Nobody has knowledge about who was such a tzaddik, even one of these exceptionally righteous people would not know that they really are such a tzadik. These people are understood to have perfected their personal service of God to such an extent that they become literally and physically aware of God. These righteous people's perception (of both spiritual and physical, not to mention temporal matters) transcends the apparent boundaries of existence.\n\nHowever, a Hasidic rebbe is generally said to be a righteous person, called a \"tzaddik\". Furthermore, a rebbe is said to be able to affect divine providence, and a rebbe is said to be able to \"see the future\", or at least have strong insight into the life and trials of another.\n\nAs a result, Hasidim in some Hasidic circles seek their rebbe's advice for a variety of concerns: spiritual, physical, and even business concerns. Furthermore, many people seek the blessing \"(bracha)\" of a rebbe (and a Hasid will specifically seek the blessing of his own rebbe) for anything, from minor (and all the more so major) physical troubles, to grand spiritual concerns. Many famous and common stories of a rebbe's intervention involve women who successfully seek a rebbe's blessing for fertility so that they can conceive after having been barren for many years.\n\nIn some movements the Hasidim believe that their rebbe is the \"\"tzadik hador\"\" (tzaddik of the generation) and would regard any thought that detracts from his perfection and holiness as heresy. Other sects lessen this idealization to some degree or another. Since many rebbes are sons-in-law or students of other rebbes, it makes sense that they would view themselves as subordinate to those other rebbes. Nonetheless, their Hasidim remain loyal to them because of their special loyalty, a family connection, or a belief that a specific \"tzaddik\" or Nasi HaDor (although others might have greater spiritual stature) connects best with one's soul. For example, the Kosover Rebbe makes yearly pilgrimages to the Tosher Rebbe. Nonetheless, his followers remain very loyal to him.\n\nUnlike rabbis or non-Hasidic rebbes in other Jewish movements, Hasidic Judaism considers a \"hasidic rebbe\" to be a conduit between Jews and God. On the basis of traditional Kabbalistic concepts and terminology, Hasidic philosophy bridged deveikut, a Jewish concept referring to closeness to God, to the Hasidic rebbe, embodying and channeling the Divine flow of blessing to the world, because Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce, without which it would revert to nothingness.\n\nGiven a rebbe's physical awareness of God, and the rebbe's transcendent perception of Godliness, many Hasidim take special care to observe the specific and sometimes minute practices of their rebbe. Even things that seem mundane may nonetheless be seen by Hasidim as incredibly significant. For example, Lubavitcher Hasidim frequently shape their fedoras to match the way that the Lubavitcher Rebbe shaped his hat-which was more flat than many others. Many Skverer Hasidim (of the Skverer Rebbe in New Square) wear their peyos identical to those of the Skverer Rebbe. While Hasidim do not always follow the specific practices of their rebbe, the rebbe is able to create practices that may be specific and unique to his Hasidim. For example, Rabbi Aaron Roth (\"Reb Areleh\", as he was called) the first rebbe of Shomer Emunim, told his Hasidim to pause frequently while eating their meals in order to keep them from overindulging. A Hasid will usually love his rebbe like a close family member, if not more so. The degree and nature of this belief varies, however, depending on the movement.\n\nThere are some functions which are exclusively the domain of Hasidic rebbes:\n\nA rebbe conducts a \"tish\" (: \"feert tish\", literally, \"to run [a] table\") or a \"farbrengen\"—a communal festive meal with highly mystical overtones—on Shabbat and other occasions. At a tish, the rebbe distributes \"shirayim\" (lit. remnants) to the Hasidim seated at or gathered round the table. When a gathering similar to a \"tish\" is led by a rabbi who is not a rebbe (i.e. a Mashpia), it can be referred to as a \"botte\" (esp. amongst groups from Romania) or \"sheves achim\".\n\nA rebbe has times when Hasidim (and other petitioners) may come for a private audience. A kvitel (Yiddish for \"note\", plural \"kvitlach\") is a note with the name of the petitioner and a short request for which the rebbe is asked to pray. The formula in which a person's name is written is one's own Hebrew name, the son/daughter of one's mother's Hebrew name, such as \"Shimon ben Rivkah\" (Simeon the son of Rebecca). Hasidim believe that rebbes read supernaturally \"between the lines\" of a \"kvitel\", and in every Hasidic movement there are numerous anecdotes relating how the rebbe saw things that were not written in the \"kvitel\". In most Hasidic groups, the \"kvitel\" is written by the rebbe's \"gabbai\" (secretary), however sometimes the petitioner writes it on his own. Usually, but with some exceptions, a \"pidyon\" (redemption) of cash is customarily handed to the rebbe under the \"kvitel\", but this is not obligatory. This is considered to be the conduit through which the blessing is given, and a redemption for the soul of the petitioner. (\"A gift makes its receiver glad\" is given as an explanation: a blessing only comes from a joyous heart.) It is also customary to tip the gabbai, although this too is not obligatory.\nOthers are not exclusive to Hasidic rebbes, but are often an important part of their role:\n\n\n"}

If bonito is not available, dried anchovies or sardines may be substituted. The element of umami, one of the five basic tastes, is introduced into dashi from the use of katsuobushi and kombu. Katsuobushi is especially high in sodium inosinate and kombu is especially high in glutamic acids; both combined create a synergy of umami.\n\nHomemade \"dashi\", made from dried kombu and katsuobushi, is less popular today, even in Japan.

Compared to the taste of homemade dashi, instant dashi tends to have a stronger, less subtle flavor, due to the use of chemical flavor enhancers—glutamates and ribonucleotides.\n\nOther kinds of dashi stock are made by soaking kelp, niboshi, or shiitake in water for many hours or by heating them in near-boiling water and straining the resulting broth.\n\n\nIn 1908, the unusual and strong flavor of kelp dashi was identified by Kikunae Ikeda as \"umami\", the \"fifth flavor\", attributed to human taste receptors responding to glutamic acid.\n\n"}
{"id": "167097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167097", "title": "OK", "text": "OK\n\n\"OK\" (spelling variations include \"okay\", \"O.K.\", \"ok\") is an American English word denoting approval, acceptance, agreement, assent, acknowledgment, or a sign of indifference. \"OK\" is frequently used as a loanword in other languages. It has been described as the most frequently spoken or written word on the planet. The origins of the word are disputed.\n\nAs an adjective, \"OK\" principally means \"adequate\" or \"acceptable\" as a contrast to \"bad\" (\"The boss approved this, so it is OK to send out\"); it can also mean \"mediocre\" when used in contrast with \"good\" (\"The french fries were great, but the burger was just OK\"). It fulfills a similar role as an adverb (\"Wow, you did OK for your first time skiing!\"). As an interjection, it can denote compliance (\"OK, I will do that\"), or agreement (\"OK, that is fine\"). It can mean \"assent\" when it is used as a noun (\"the boss gave her the OK to the purchase\") or, more colloquially, as a verb (\"the boss OKed the purchase\"). \"OK\", as an adjective, can express acknowledgement without approval. As a versatile discourse marker or back-channeling item, it can also be used with appropriate to show doubt or to seek confirmation (\"OK?\", \"Is that OK?\").\n\nMany explanations for the origin of the expression have been suggested, but few have been discussed seriously by linguists. The following proposals have found mainstream recognition.\n\nThe etymology that most reference works provide today is based on a survey of the word's early history in print: a series of six articles by Allen Walker Read in the journal \"American Speech\" in 1963 and 1964. He tracked the spread and evolution of the word in American newspapers and other written documents, and later throughout the rest of the world. He also documented controversy surrounding \"OK\" and the history of its folk etymologies, both of which are intertwined with the history of the word itself. Read argues that, at the time of the expression's first appearance in print, a broader fad existed in the United States of \"comical misspellings\" and of forming and employing acronyms, themselves based on colloquial speech patterns:\n\nThe general fad is speculated to have existed in spoken or informal written U.S. English for a decade or more before its appearance in newspapers. \"OK\"s original presentation as \"all correct\" was later varied with spellings such as \"Oll Korrect\" or even \"Ole Kurreck\".\n\nThe term appears to have achieved national prominence in 1840, when supporters of the Democratic political party claimed during the 1840 United States presidential election that it stood for \"Old Kinderhook\", a nickname for the Democratic president and candidate for reelection, Martin Van Buren, a native of Kinderhook, New York. \"Vote for OK\" was snappier than using his Dutch name. In response, Whig opponents attributed \"OK\", in the sense of \"Oll Korrect,\" to Andrew Jackson's bad spelling. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in \"OK\"s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.\n\nRead proposed an etymology of \"OK\" in \"Old Kinderhook\" in 1941. The evidence presented in that article was somewhat sparse, and the connection to \"Oll Korrect\" not fully elucidated. Various challenges to the etymology were presented; e.g., Heflin's 1962 article. However, Read's landmark 1963–1964 papers silenced most of the skepticism. Read's etymology gained immediate acceptance, and is now offered without reservation in most dictionaries. Read himself was nevertheless open to evaluating alternative explanations:\n\nIn \"All Mixed Up\", the folk singer Pete Seeger sang that \"OK\" was of Choctaw origin, as the dictionaries of the time tended to agree. Three major American reference works (Webster's, New Century, Funk & Wagnalls) cited this etymology as the probable origin until as late as 1961.\n\nThe earliest written evidence for the Choctaw origin is provided in work by the Christian missionaries Cyrus Byington and Alfred Wright in 1825. These missionaries ended many sentences in their translation of the Bible with the particle \"okeh\", meaning \"it is so\", and was listed as an alternative spelling in the 1913 Webster's.\n\nByington's \"Dictionary of the Choctaw Language\" confirms the ubiquity of the \"okeh\" particle, and his \"Grammar of the Choctaw Language\" calls the particle \"-keh\" an \"affirmative contradistinctive\", with the \"distinctive\" o- prefix.\n\nThe Choctaw language was one of the languages spoken at this time in the South-Eastern United States by a tribe with significant contact with African slaves. The major language of trade in this area, Mobilian Jargon, was based on Choctaw-Chickasaw, two Muskogean-family languages. This language was used, in particular, for communication with the slave-owning Cherokee (an Iroquoian-family language). For the three decades prior to the Boston abbreviation fad, the Choctaw had been in extensive negotiation with the US government, after having fought alongside them at the Battle of New Orleans.\n\nArguments for a more Southern origin for the word note the tendency of English to adopt loan words in language contact situations, as well as the ubiquity of the OK particle. Similar particles exist in native language groups distinct from Iroquoian (Algonquian, Cree cf. \"ekosi\").\n\nA verifiable early written attestation of the particle 'kay' is from transcription by Smyth (1784) of a North Carolina slave not wanting to be flogged by a European visiting America:\n\nA West African (Mande and/or Bantu) etymology has been argued in scholarly sources, tracing the word back to the Wolof and Bantu word \"waw-kay\" or the Mande (aka \"Mandinke\" or \"Mandingo\") phrase \"o ke\".\n\nDavid Dalby first made the claim that the particle \"OK\" could have African origins in the 1969 Hans Wolff Memorial Lecture. His argument was reprinted in various newspaper articles between 1969 and 1971. This suggestion has also been mentioned more recently by Joseph Holloway, who argued in the 1993 book \"The African Heritage of American English\" (co-written with a retired missionary) that various West African languages have near-homophone discourse markers with meanings such as \"yes indeed\" or which serve as part of the back-channeling repertoire. Though Frederic Cassidy challenged Dalby's claims, asserting that there is no documentary evidence that any of these African-language words had any causal link with its use in the American press, one can certainly wonder at the fact that this standard of written proof does not account for the illiteracy in which the West African speakers were kept during the period of slavery in question.\n\nThe West African hypothesis had not been accepted by 1981 by any etymologists, yet has since appeared in scholarly sources published by linguists and non-linguists alike.\n\nA large number of origins have been proposed. Some of them are thought to fall into the category of folk etymology and are proposed based merely on apparent similarity between \"OK\" and one or another phrase in a foreign language with a similar meaning and sound. Some examples are:\n\n\nAllen Walker Read identifies the earliest known use of \"O.K.\" in print as 1839, in the edition of 23 March of the \"Boston Morning Post\". The announcement of a trip by the Anti-Bell-Ringing Society (a \"frolicsome group\" according to Read) received attention from the Boston papers. Charles Gordon Greene wrote about the event using the line that is widely regarded as the first instance of this strain of \"OK\", complete with gloss:\n\nRead gives a number of subsequent appearances in print. Seven instances were accompanied with glosses that were variations on \"all correct\" such as \"oll korrect\" or \"ole kurreck\", but five appeared with no accompanying explanation, suggesting that the word was expected to be well known to readers and possibly in common colloquial use at the time.\n\nVarious claims of earlier usage have been made. For example, it was claimed that the phrase appeared in a 1790 court record from Sumner County, Tennessee, discovered in 1859 by a Tennessee historian named Albigence Waldo Putnam, in which Andrew Jackson apparently said \"proved a bill of sale from Hugh McGary to Gasper Mansker, for an uncalled good, which was O.K.\". However, Read challenged such claims, and his assertions have been generally accepted. The great lawyer who successfully argued many Indian rights claims, however, supports the Jacksonian popularization of the term based on its Choctaw origin.\n\nDavid Dalby (see above) brought up some other earlier attested usages. One example from 1941 is the apparent notation \"we arrived ok\" in the hand-written diary of William Richardson going from Boston to New Orleans in 1815, about a month after the Battle of New Orleans. Frederic Cassidy asserts that he personally tracked down this diary and notes that:\n\nSimilarly, H. L. Mencken, who originally considered it \"very clear that 'o. k.' is actually in the manuscript\", later recanted his endorsement of the expression, asserting that it was used no earlier than 1839. Mencken (following Read) described the diary entry as a misreading of the author's self-correction, and stated it was in reality the first two letters of the words \"a h[andsome]\" before noticing the phrase had been used in the previous line and changing his mind.\n\nAnother example given by Dalby is a Jamaican planter's diary of 1816, which records a black slave saying \"Oh ki, massa, doctor no need be fright, we no want to hurt him\". Cassidy asserts that this is a misreading of the source, which actually begins \"Oh, ki, massa ...\", where \"ki\" is a phrase by itself:\n\nWhether this word is printed as OK, Ok, ok, okay, or O.K. is a matter normally resolved in the style manual for the publication involved. Dictionaries and style guides such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and \"The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage\" provide no consensus.\n\nIn 1961, NASA popularized the variant \"A-OK\" during the launch of Alan Shepard's Mercury mission.\n\nIn Brazil, Mexico and Peru, as well as in other Latin American countries, the word is pronounced just as it is in English and is used very frequently. Spanish speakers often spell the word \"okey\" to conform with the spelling rules of the language. In Brazil, it may be also pronounced as \"ô-kei\". In Portugal, it is used with its Portuguese pronunciation and sounds something like \"ókâi\" (similar to the English pronunciation but with the \"ó\" sounding like the \"o\" in \"lost\" or \"top\"), or even as 'oh-kapa', from the letters \"O\" ('ó') and \"K\" ('capa'). In Spain it's much less common than in Latin American countries (words such as \"vale\" or \"de acuerdo\" are preferred) but it may still be heard.\n\nIn Flanders and the Netherlands, \"OK\" has become part of the everyday Dutch language. It is pronounced the same way.\n\nArabic speakers also use the word (أوكي) widely, particularly in areas of former British presence like Egypt, Jordan, Israel/Palestine and Iraq, but also all over the Arab world due to the prevalence of American cinema and television. It is pronounced just as it is in English but is very rarely seen in Arabic newspapers and formal media.\n\nIn Hebrew, the word \"OK\" is common as an equivalent to the Hebrew word בסדר [b'seder] ('adequate', 'in order'). It is written as it sounds in English אוקיי.\n\nIt is used in Japan and Korea in a somewhat restricted sense, fairly equivalent to \"all right\". \"OK\" is often used in colloquial Japanese as a replacement for 大丈夫 (daijōbu \"all right\")　or いい (ii \"good\") and often followed by です (desu – the copula). A transliteration of the English word, written as オーケー (lit. \"ōkē\") or オッケー (lit. \"okkē\") is also often used in the same manner as the English, and is becoming more popular in recent years. In Korean, 오케이 (literally \"okay\") can be used colloquially in place of 네 (ne, \"yes\") when expressing approval or acknowledgment.\n\nIn Chinese, the term (literally: \"good\"), can be modified to fit most of usages of \"OK\". For example, closely resembles the interjection usage of \"OK\". The \"了\" indicates a change of state; in this case it indicates the achievement of consensus. Likewise, \"OK\" is commonly transformed into \"OK了\" (OK le) when communicating with foreigners or with fellow Cantonese speaking people in at least Hong Kong and possibly to an extent other regions of China. Other usages of \"OK\" such as \"I am OK\" can be translated as . In Hong Kong, movies or dramas set in modern times use the term \"ok\" as part of the sprinkling of English included in otherwise Cantonese dialog. In Mandarin Chinese it is also somewhat humorously used in the \"spelling\" of the word for karaoke, \"卡拉OK\", pronounced \"kah-lah-oh-kei\" (Mandarin does not natively have a syllable with the pronunciation \"kei\"). On the computer, OK is usually translated as \"确定,\" which means \"confirm\" or \"confirmed\".\n\nIn Taiwan, \"OK\" is frequently used in various sentences, popular among but not limited to younger generations. This includes the aforementioned \"OK了\" (Okay le), \"OK嗎\" (Okay ma), meaning \"Is it okay?\" or \"OK啦\" (Okay la), a strong, persuading affirmative, as well as the somewhat tongue-in-cheek explicit yes/no construction \"O不OK？\" (O bù OK?), \"Is it OK or not?\"\n\nIn Russia, \"OK\" is used very frequently for any positive meaning. The word in Russian has many morphologies: \"окей\", \"океюшки\", \"ок\", \"окейно\", etc.\n\nIn France and Belgium, \"OK\" is used to communicate agreement, and is generally followed by a French phrase (e.g. \"OK, d'accord\", \"ok, chef\") or another borrowing (e.g., \"OK, boss. ok, bye.\"). Rarely pronounced /ɔk/ these days, except by young children encountering dialog boxes for the first times.\n\nIn the Philippines \"okay lang\" is a common expression, literally meaning \"just okay\" or \"just fine\". Sometimes spelled as \"okey\".\n\nIn Malay, it is frequently used with the emphatic suffix \"lah\": OK-lah.\n\nIn Vietnamese, it is spelled \"Ô kê\".\n\nIn India, it is often used after a sentence to mean \"did you get it?\", often not regarded politely, for example, \"I want this job done, OK?\" or at the end of a conversation (mostly on the phone) followed by \"bye\" as in \"OK, bye.\"\n\nIn Indonesia, \"OK\" is also used as a slogan of national television station RCTI since the year 1994.\n\nIn Pakistan, \"OK\" has become a part of Urdu and Punjabi languages.\n\nIn Germany, \"OK\" is spelled as \"o.k.\" or \"O.K.\" or \"okay\". It may be pronounced as in English, but /ɔˈkeː/ or /oˈkeː/ are also common. The meaning ranges from acknowledgement to describing something neither good nor bad, same as in US/UK usage.\n\nIn Maldivian Okay is used in different ways, often used to agree with something, more often used while departing from a gathering \"Okay Dahnee/Kendee.\"\n\nIn Singapore, \"OK\" is often used with suffix-es used in \"Singlish\" such as OK lor, OK lah, OK meh, OK leh ... etc. which are used in different occasions.\n\nIn the United States and much of Europe a related gesture is made by touching the index finger with the thumb (forming a rough circle) and raising of the remaining fingers. It is not known whether the gesture is derived from the expression, or if the gesture appeared first. The gesture was popularized in America in 1840 as a symbol to support then Presidential candidate Martin Van Buren. This was because Van Buren's nickname, Old Kinderhook, derived from his hometown of Kinderhook, NY, had the initials O K. Similar gestures have different meanings in other cultures, some offensive, others devotional.\n\n\"OK\" is used to label buttons in modal dialog boxes such as error messages or print dialogs, indicating that the user must press the button to accept the contents of the dialog box and continue. When a modal dialog box contains only one button, it is almost always labeled \"OK\" by convention and default, usually rendered to the screen in upper case without punctuation: \"OK\", rather than \"O.K.\", \"Okay\", or \"Ok\". The \"OK\" button can probably be traced to user interface research done for the Apple Lisa. The inspiration was likely the -ok parameter in Unix' \"find\" command.\n\nThe Forth programming language prints \"ok\" when ready to accept input from the keyboard. This prompt is used on Sun, Apple, and other computers with the Forth-based Open Firmware (OpenBoot). The appearance of \"ok\" in inappropriate contexts is the subject of some humor.\n\nIn HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol, upon which the World Wide Web is based, a successful response from the server is defined as \"OK\" (with the numerical code 200 as specified in RFC 2616). The Session Initiation Protocol also defines a response, \"200 OK\", which conveys success for most requests (RFC 3261).\n\nSome Linux distributions, including those based on Red Hat, display boot progress on successive lines on-screen, which include \"[ OK ]\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "167240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167240", "title": "Omelette", "text": "Omelette\n\nIn cuisine, an omelette or omelet is a dish made from beaten eggs fried with butter or oil in a frying pan (without stirring as in scrambled egg). It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around a filling such as cheese, chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are beaten, sometimes with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.\n\nThe fluffy omelette is a refined version of an ancient food. According to Alan Davidson, the French word \"omelette\" came into use during the mid-16th century, but the versions \"alumelle\" and \"alumete\" are employed by the Ménagier de Paris (II, 5) in 1393. Rabelais (\"Pantagruel\", IV, 9) mentions an \"homelaicte d'oeufs\", Olivier de Serres an \"amelette\", François Pierre La Varenne's \"Le cuisinier françois\" (1651) has \"aumelette\", and the modern \"omelette\" appears in \"Cuisine bourgoise\" (1784).\n\nAccording to the founding legend of the annual giant Easter omelette of Bessières, Haute-Garonne, when Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were traveling through southern France, they decided to rest for the night near the town of Bessières. Napoleon feasted on an omelette prepared by a local innkeeper, and thought it was a culinary delight. He then ordered the townspeople to gather all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day.\n\nOn March 19, 1994, the largest omelette () in the world at the time was made with 160,000 eggs in Yokohama, Japan, but was subsequently overtaken by another, weighing , made by the Canadian Lung Association at the Brockville Memorial Centre in Brockville, Ontario, Canada, on May 11, 2002. In turn, that record was surpassed on August 11, 2012, by an omelette cooked by the Ferreira do Zêzere City Council in Santarém, Portugal. This record-breaking omelette weighed , and required 145,000 eggs and a diameter pan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "167612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167612", "title": "Jerky", "text": "Jerky\n\nJerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat, cut into strips, and then dried to prevent spoilage. Normally, this drying includes the addition of salt, to prevent bacteria from developing on the meat before sufficient moisture has been removed. The word \"jerky\" is derived from the Quechua word \"ch'arki\" which means \"dried, salted meat\". All that is needed to produce basic \"jerky\" is a low-temperature drying method, and salt to inhibit bacterial growth.\n\nModern manufactured jerky is normally marinated in a seasoned spice rub or liquid, and dried, dehydrated or smoked with low heat (usually under 70 °C/160 °F). Some product manufacturers finely grind meat, mix in seasonings, and press the meat-paste into flat shapes prior to drying.\n\nThe resulting jerky from the above methods would be a salty or savory snack. However, sometimes a sweet or semi-sweet recipe is used, with sugar being a major ingredient in that variation. Jerky is ready-to-eat and needs no additional preparation. It can be stored for months without refrigeration. When the protein to moisture content ratio is correct, the resulting meat is cured, or preserved.\n\nThere are many products in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed, chopped and formed meat, rather than traditional sliced, whole-muscle meat. These products may contain more fat, but moisture content, like the whole-muscle product, must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the US. Chemical preservatives can be used to prevent oxidative spoilage, but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity. Some jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet, unlike biltong, which rarely contains added sugars.\n\nAround the world, meat from domestic and wild animals is used to make jerky. Meats from domestic animals include beef, pork, goat and mutton or lamb. Wild animals including deer, kudu, springbok, kangaroo, and bison are also used. Recently, other animals such as turkey, ostrich, salmon, alligator, crocodile, tuna, emu, horse, camel, and earthworm have entered the market.\n\nMost of the fat must be trimmed off prior to drying the meat, as fat does not dry, thus creating the potential for spoilage as the fat becomes rancid (modern vacuum packing and chemical preservatives have served to help prevent these risks). The meat must be dried quickly, to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. To do this, the meat is thinly sliced, or pressed thinly, in the case of ground meat. The strips of meat are dried at low temperatures, to avoid cooking the meat, or overdrying it to the point where it is brittle.\n\nIn factories in the 2010s, large jerky ovens are built using insulated panels. Inside these low-temperature drying ovens are many heater elements and fans. The ovens have exhaust ports to remove the moisture-laden air. The combination of fast-moving air and low heat dries the meat to the desired moisture content within a few hours. The raw, marinated jerky strips are placed on racks of nylon-coated metal screens which have been sprayed with a light vegetable oil to allow the meat to be removed easily. The screen trays are placed closely in layers on rolling carts which are then put in the drying oven.\n\nSome additional form of chemical preservative, such as sodium nitrite, is often used in conjunction with the historical salted drying procedure to prepare jerky. Smoking is the most traditional method, as it preserves, flavors, and dries the meat simultaneously. Salting is the most common method used today, as it both provides seasoning to improve the flavor as well as preserve the meat. While some methods involve applying the seasonings with a marinade, this can increase the drying time by adding moisture to the meat.\n\nAfter the jerky is dried to the proper moisture content to prevent spoilage, it is cooled, then packaged in (often resealable) plastic bags, either nitrogen gas flushed or vacuumed packed. To prevent the oxidation of the fat, the sealed packages often contain small pouches of oxygen absorber. These small packets are filled with iron particles which react with oxygen, removing the oxygen from the sealed jerky package, and from an opened and resealed unfinished packet.\n\nBecause of the necessary low fat and moisture content, jerky is high in protein. A 30 g (about 1 oz) portion of lean meat, for example, contains about 7 g of protein. By removing 15 g of water from the meat, the protein ratio is doubled to nearly 15 g of protein per 30 g portion. In some low moisture varieties, a 30 g serving will contain 21 g of protein, and only one g of fat. The price per unit weight of this type of jerky is higher than less-dried forms, as it takes 90 g of 99% lean meat to generate 30 g of jerky.\n\nUnpackaged fresh jerky made from sliced, whole muscle meat has been available in specialty stores in Hong Kong at least since the 1970s. The products are purchased by kilograms, and customers choose from 10 to 20 types of meat used to make the product. Some are sold in strands instead of slices. Macau has opened numerous specialty shops also, many of which are franchise extensions of stores from Hong Kong. Compared to the sealed packaged versions, unpackaged jerky has a relatively short shelf life.\n\nThis type of jerky has also become very popular in convenience stores in the USA under the name \"slab\" jerky; it is usually sold in plexiglass containers.\n\nMost nations have regulations pertaining to the production of dried meat products. There are strict requirements to ensure safe and wholesome production of jerky products. Factories are required to have inspectors and sanitation plans. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for that oversight. To comply with USDA regulations, poultry jerky must be heated to an internal temperature of 160 °F for uncured poultry or 155 °F for cured poultry to be considered safe Many European Union countries presently prohibit the importation of meat products, including jerky, without additional and extensive customs documentation, and further inspections.\n\nTraditional jerky, made from sliced, whole muscle meat, is readily available in the United States, Mexico and Canada in varying meats, brands and qualities, both as packaged and unpackaged. These products are available in nearly every convenience store, gas station, supermarket, and variety shop in those countries, where there is a long history of jerky as a food of the pioneers. A similar, less expensive product is made with finely ground meat, mixed with flavors, then the mush is processed into thin dried strips. The finished item may be labeled as jerky, but with the qualifier \"ground and formed\". This product is widely available in general interest stores, such as supermarkets and convenience stores.\nAlso popular is shredded dry jerky (meat floss) sold in containers resembling snuff or dip. Jerky made in the traditional style is also a ubiquitous staple of farmers' markets in rural areas all over North America.\n\nIn addition to being common in the United States, Mexico and Canada, jerky is also gaining popularity in supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Germany. They are carried by some major supermarkets, and now also smaller stores. In China, in addition to the more traditional forms of jerky, there is also a similar product which is usually made from pork called pork chip. A similar product is quite popular in Rome, Italy, and its hinterland: it is called \"coppiette\" and was originally made with horse or donkey meat, but it is now generally made with pork. Coppiette are seasoned with red pepper and fennel seeds. Coppiette were usually eaten while drinking wine (mostly white) in Roman osterie.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, India the dish is known as uppu kandam which forms part of authentic non vegetarian cuisine. In Ethiopia, jerky is called \"qwant'a\". In addition to salt, it is seasoned with black pepper and either berbere or awaze. A similar product, biltong, is common in South African cuisine; however, it differs very much in production process and taste. In Hausa cuisine, kilishi is a form of dried meat, similar to jerky, that is heavily spiced with peppers.\n\nJerky (or products closely related to it) is commonly included in military field rations. It is particularly attractive to militaries because of its light weight, high level of nutrition, long shelf life and edibility without further preparation. Since 1996, jerky has been selected by astronauts as space food several times for space flight due to its light weight and high level of nutrition.\n\nA typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10–15 g of protein, 1 g of fat, and 0–3 g of carbohydrates, although some beef jerky can have a protein content above 65%. Since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure, sodium can be a concern for some people. A 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium, which would be about 30% of the recommended USRDA. Listed in the ingredients, sugar can be the second ingredient listed after beef. For example, Old Trapper Old Fashioned beef jerky contains 5 g of sugar in a 28 g portion.\n\n\n"}

It can be made by mixing chocolate syrup (or chocolate powder) with milk (from cows, goats, soy, rice, etc.). It can be purchased pre-mixed with milk or made at home by blending milk with cocoa powder and a sweetener (such as sugar or a sugar substitute), melted chocolate, chocolate syrup, or a pre-made powdered chocolate milk mix. Other ingredients, such as starch, salt, carrageenan, vanilla, or artificial flavoring are sometimes added. \nTo add nutritional value to the product, sometimes some minerals like zinc oxide or iron are added.\n\nThe carrageenan is used at very low concentrations to form an imperceptible weak gel that prevents the large, dense particles of chocolate from sedimentation. Chocolate milk should be refrigerated like unflavored milk, with the exception of some ultra high temperature (UHT) pasteurized drinks, which can be stored at room temperature. Chocolate milk was first created by Hans Sloane in Ireland during the late 1700s, and is generally served cold. The nutritional qualities of chocolate milk are the subject of debate: while some studies criticize the high sugar content of chocolate milk, other studies suggest that chocolate milk is nutritionally superior to white milk.\n\nSome nutritionists have criticized chocolate milk for its high sugar content and its relationship to childhood obesity. In New York City, school food officials report that nearly 60 percent of the 100 million cartons served each year contain fat-free chocolate milk. Because chocolate milk can contain twice as much sugar as plain low-fat milk from added sugars, some school districts have stopped serving the product altogether, including some areas in California and Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to a nationally representative online survey commissioned by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, seven percent of American adults believe that chocolate milk comes from brown cows.\n\nA number of studies have been issued in regards to chocolate milk nutrition. A 2005 study by the New York City (NYC) Department of Education found that by removing whole milk and replacing it with low-fat or fat-free chocolate milk, students were served an estimated 5,960 fewer calories and 619 fewer grams of fat per year. However, more recent studies show that fat-free and low-fat milk may actually increase body fat and contribute to obesity. Whole milk may in fact be healthier for obese children than low-fat or non-fat milk.\n\nIn a study conducted in 2006, researchers stated that the benefits of drinking chocolate milk were likely due to its ratio of carbohydrates to protein, among other nutritional properties. However, this study was small in scale as it was conducted on only nine athletes and was partially funded by the dairy industry. Furthermore, the study compared chocolate milk to two energy drinks and unflavored milk was not used as a comparison, so it is unknown if chocolate milk is superior to unflavored milk as a recovery drink.\n\nAn April 2007 study from Loughborough University indicated that chocolate milk can boost recovery when taken after athletic workouts. The study found that milk was an effective rehydration drink.\n\nA November 2009 study conducted by scientists in Barcelona, Spain suggests that regularly consuming skimmed milk with cocoa rich in flavonoids may reduce inflammation and slow or prevent the development of atherosclerosis. However, the study notes that its effects are not as pronounced as seen in consumption of red wine.\n\nA study published in 2009 compared chocolate milk to a commercial recovery beverage (matched for carbohydrate and protein content) administered to cyclists after intense workouts. The researchers found no difference in post-workout plasma creatine kinase levels and muscle soreness, nor in cycling time to exhaustion. However, being that chocolate milk is usually less expensive than commercial recovery beverages, the researchers concluded that chocolate milk \"serves as a more convenient, cheaper...recovery beverage option for many athletes\".\n\nA May 2010 sports nutrition study concluded that \"exercise recovery during short-term periods of heavy soccer training appears to be similar when isocaloric CM (Chocolate Milk) and CHO (Carbohydrate) beverages are consumed post-exercise\".\n\nYet another study in 2011 at Kean University in New Jersey concluded similar results in male soccer players discovering that there was an increase in time to fatigue when chocolate milk was consumed. The Kean University study also viewed chocolate milk's effects on female soccer players undergoing morning and afternoon practices during preseason. They were either given the carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage or chocolate milk between morning and afternoon preseason practices. Following every afternoon practice, each athlete completed a shuttle run to fatigue. The study concluded that chocolate milk is just as beneficial as the carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage in promoting recovery in women.\n\nThere are 5 milligrams of caffeine in each mini carton of chocolate milk. Chocolate has oxalic acid, which reacts with the calcium in the milk producing calcium oxalate, thus preventing the calcium from being absorbed in the intestine. However, it is present in small enough amounts that the effect on calcium absorption is negligible. As chocolate contains relatively small amounts of oxalate, it is unclear to what extent chocolate consumption affects healthy people with calcium-rich diets.\n\nIn a 2008 study, participants who consumed one or more servings of chocolate on a daily basis had lower bone density and strength than those participants who ate a serving of chocolate six times a week or less. Researchers believe this may be due to oxalate inhibiting calcium absorption – but it could also be due to sugar content in chocolate, which may increase calcium excretion. It is clear however, that consuming foods high in oxalate – and in turn their effect on calcium absorption – is a more significant concern for people with oxalate kidney stones, which occur when there is too much oxalate in the urine. These people especially should reduce their oxalate intake and increase their calcium intake. However, the high magnesium content in chocolate is likely to reduce the risk of stone formation, because like citrate, magnesium is also an inhibitor of urinary crystal formation.\n"}
{"id": "169637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169637", "title": "Imperium", "text": "Imperium\n\nIn ancient Rome, Imperium was a form of authority held by a citizen to control a military or governmental entity. It is distinct from \"auctoritas\" and \"potestas\", different and generally inferior types of power in the Roman Republic and Empire. One's \"imperium\" could be over a specific military unit, or it could be over a province or territory. Individuals given such power were referred to as curule magistrates or promagistrates. These included the curule aedile, the praetor, the consul, the magister equitum, and the dictator. In a general sense, \"imperium\" was the scope of someone's power, and could include anything, such as public office, commerce, political influence, or wealth.\n\nIn ancient Rome, \"imperium\" could be used as a term indicating a characteristic of people, the wealth held in items, or the measure of formal power they had. This qualification could be used in a rather loose context (for example, poets used it, not necessarily writing about state officials). However, in Roman society it was also a more formal concept of legal authority. A man with \"imperium\" (\"imperator\") had, in principle, absolute authority to apply the law within the scope of his magistracy or promagistracy. He could be vetoed or overruled either by a magistrate or promagistrate who was a colleague with equal power (e.g. a fellow consul) or by one whose \"imperium\" outranked his - that is, one of \"imperium maius\" (greater \"imperium).\"\n\nSome modern scholars such as A.H.M. Jones have defined \"imperium\" as \"the power vested by the state in a person to do what he considers to be in the best interests of the state\".\n\n\"Imperium\" can be distinguished from \"regnum\", or royal power, which was inherited. \"Imperium\" was originally a military concept, the power of the \"imperator\" (general in the army) to command. The word derives from the Latin verb, \"imperare\" (to command). The title \"imperator\" was applied to the emperor, who was the commander of the armed forces. In fact, the Latin word, \"imperator\", gives us the English word \"emperor\".\n\n\"Imperium\" was indicated in two prominent ways. A \"curule\" magistrate or promagistrate carried an ivory baton surmounted by an eagle as his personal symbol of office (compare the field marshal's baton). Any such magistrate was also escorted by \"lictors\" bearing the \"fasces\" (traditional symbols of imperium and authority); when outside the \"pomerium\", axes were added to the \"fasces\" to indicate an imperial magistrate's power to enact capital punishment outside Rome (the axes were removed within the \"pomerium\"). The number of lictors in attendance upon a magistrate was an overt indication of the degree of \"imperium\". When in the field, a \"curule\" magistrate possessing an \"imperium\" greater or equal to that of a praetor wore a sash ritually knotted on the front of his cuirass. Further, any man executing \"imperium\" within his sphere of influence was entitled to the curule chair.\n\n\nAs can be seen, dictatorial \"imperium\" was superior to consular, consular to praetorian, and praetorian to aedilician; there is some historical dispute as to whether or not praetorian \"imperium\" was superior to \"equine-magisterial\" \"imperium\". A promagistrate, or a man executing a \"curule\" office without actually holding that office, also possessed \"imperium\" in the same degree as the actual incumbents (i.e., proconsular \"imperium\" being more or less equal to consular \"imperium\", propraetorian \"imperium\" to praetorian) and was attended by an equal number of \"lictors\".\n\nCertain extraordinary commissions, such as Pompey's famous command against the pirates, were invested with \"imperium maius\" meaning they outranked all other owners of imperium of the same type or rank (in Pompey's case, even the consuls) within their sphere of command (his being \"ultimate on the seas, and within 50 miles inland\"). \"Imperium maius\" later became a hallmark of the Roman emperor.\n\nAnother technical use of the term in Roman law was for the power to extend the law beyond its mere interpretation, extending \"imperium\" from formal legislators under the ever-republican constitution: popular assemblies, senate, magistrates, emperor and their delegates to the jurisprudence of jurisconsults.\n\nWhile the Byzantine Eastern Roman Emperors retained full Roman imperium and made the episcopate subservient, in the feudal West a long rivalry would oppose the claims to supremacy within post-Roman Christianity between \"sacerdotium\" in the person of the Pope and the secular \"imperium\" of the revived Western Roman Emperor since Charlemagne. Both would refer to the heritage of Roman law by their titular link with the very city Rome: the Pope, Bishop \"of Rome\", versus the Holy \"Roman\" Emperor (even though his seat of power was north of the Alps).\n\nThe Donatio Constantini, by which the Papacy had allegedly been granted the territorial Patrimonium Petri in Central Italy, became a weapon against the Emperor. The first pope who used it in an official act and relied upon it, Leo IX, cites the \"Donatio\" in a letter of 1054 to Michael Cærularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, to show that the Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly \"imperium\", the royal priesthood. Thenceforth the \"Donatio\" acquires more importance and is more frequently used as evidence in the ecclesiastical and political conflicts between the papacy and the secular power: Anselm of Lucca and Cardinal Deusdedit inserted it in their collections of canons; Gratian excluded it from his \"Decretum\", but it was soon added to it as \"Palea\"; the ecclesiastical writers in defence of the papacy during the conflicts of the early part of the 12th century quoted it as authoritative.\n\nIn one bitter episode, Pope Gregory IX who had several times mediated between the Lombards and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the Pope and the Emperor the antagonism between Church and State became more evident: the Pope claimed for himself the \"imperium animarum\" 'command of the souls' (i.e. voicing God's will to the faithful) and the \"principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo\" 'princedom over all things and bodies in the whole world', while the Emperor wished to restore the \"imperium mundi\", imperium (as under Roman Law) over the (now Christian) world — Rome was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans, so he energetically protested against the authority of the Pope. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova (1237), only embittered the opposition between Church and State. The pope again excommunicated the \"self-confessed heretic\", the \"blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse\" (20 March 1239) who now attempted to conquer the rest of Italy, i.e. the papal states, et cetera.\n\nIn some monotheistic religions such as Christianity (the Catholic Church where the official language, Latin, used terms as \"Imperium Dei/Domini\") the Divine is held to have a superior imperium, as ultimate King of Kings, above all earthly powers. Whenever a society accepts this Divine will to be expressed on earth, as by a religious authority, this can lead to theocratic legitimation. However, the Catholic Church and most other Christian groups acknowledge the authority of secular governments. If however a secular ruler controls the religious hierarchy, he can use it to legitimize his own authority.\n\nThus absolute, universal power was vested under early Islam in the original Caliphate (before it became the political toy of worldly powers 'behind the throne' and was even politically discarded by essentially secular princes), and later again claimed by Mahdis.\n\nThe chief minister of Henry VIII, the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer suggested removal of the Roman Catholic papacy's \"imperium in imperio\" (Latin for \"state within a state\") by requesting that Parliament pass the Act in Restraint of Appeals (1533) specifying that England was an empire and that The Crown was imperial, and a year later the Act of Supremacy proclaiming the Imperial Crown Protector and Supreme Head of the Church of England.\n\nIn Orthodox Russia too, when Peter I the Great assumed the Byzantine imperial titles \"Imperator\" and Autokrator, instead of the royal Tsar, the idea in founding the Russian Holy Synod was to put an end to the old \"Imperium in imperio\" of the free Church, by substituting the synod for the all too independent Patriarch of Moscow, which had become almost a rival of the Tsars — Peter meant to unite all authority in himself, over Church as well as State: through his Ober-Procurator and synod, the Emperor ruled his Church as absolutely as the military through their respective ministries; he appointed its members just as he did generals; and the Russian Government continued his policy until the end of the empire in 1917.\n\n"}
{"id": "169900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169900", "title": "Margarita", "text": "Margarita\n\nA margarita is a cocktail consisting of tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice often served with salt on the rim of the glass. The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice (straight up). Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in the eponymous margarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe.\n\nAccording to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the margarita is merely a popular Mexican and American drink, the Daisy (\"margarita\" is Spanish for \"daisy\"), remade with tequila instead of brandy, which became popular during Prohibition as people drifted over the border for alcohol. There is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita \"creation myths\".\n\n1937 Cafe Royal Cocktail Book contains a recipe for a Picador using the same concentrations of tequila, triple sec and lime juice as a margarita. One of the earliest stories is of the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos \"Danny\" Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California, created for customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits, but not to tequila. This story was related by Herrera and also by bartender Albert Hernandez, acknowledged for popularizing a margarita in San Diego after 1947, at the La Plaza restaurant in La Jolla.\n\nThere are also claims that the margarita was first mixed in Juárez, Chihuahua at Tommy's Place Bar on July 4, 1942 by Francisco \"Pancho\" Morales. Morales later left bartending in Mexico to become a US citizen, where he worked as a milkman for 25 years. Mexico's official news agency Notimex and many experts have said Morales has the strongest claim to having invented the margarita.\n\nOthers say the inventor was Dallas socialite Margarita Sames, when she concocted the drink for her guests at her Acapulco, Guerrero vacation home in 1948. Tommy Hilton reportedly attended, bringing the drink back to the Hilton chain of hotels. However, Jose Cuervo was already running ad campaigns for the margarita three years earlier, in 1945, with the slogan, \"Margarita: It's more than a girl's name.\" According to Jose Cuervo, the cocktail was invented in 1938 by a bartender in honor of Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa.\nAnother common origin tale begins the cocktail's history at the legendary Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas where, in 1948, head bartender Santos Cruz created the margarita for singer Peggy (Margaret) Lee. He supposedly named it after the Spanish version of her name, Margarita.\n\nThe first known publication of a margarita recipe was in the December 1953 issue of \"Esquire\", with a recipe calling for an ounce of tequila, a dash of triple sec and the juice of half a lime or lemon. A recipe for a tequila-based cocktail first appeared in the 1930 book \"My New Cocktail Book\" by G.F. Steele. Without noting a specific recipe or inventor, a drink called the Tequila Daisy was mentioned in the \"Syracuse Herald\" as early as 1936. Margarita is Spanish for Daisy, which is a nickname for Margaret.\n\nA later, certainly false, story is that the margarita was invented in October 1961, at a party in Houston, Texas, by party goer Robert James \"Rusty\" Thomson while acting as bartender. He concocted a mixture of equal parts tequila, Controy orange liqueur, lime, and crushed ice in a salt-rimmed glass. However, Thomson's recipe was made with Damiana Liqueur, not Cointreau orange liqueur. It is said that the idea was an experiment after running out of rum while making frozen daiquiris.\n\nThe IBA (IBA Official list of Cocktails) standard is 7:4:3, that is, 50% tequila, 29% Cointreau, 21% fresh lime juice.\n\nThe \"Original Margarita\" recipe as given by Cointreau on their website has slightly less of their own sweet liqueur: 1 part white tequila, part Cointreau, and part fresh squeezed lime juice.\n\nBesides Cointreau, other orange-flavored liqueurs that might be used include Grand Marnier (yielding the \"Cadillac Margarita\"), Gran Gala, other brands of triple sec, or blue curaçao (yielding the \"blue margarita\"). When sweeter fruit juices or freshly puréed fruits are added to the margarita, the orange-flavored liqueur is often reduced or eliminated entirely. In addition to orange-flavored liqueurs, secondary liqueurs may occasionally be added to a cocktail, including melon-flavored or black raspberry-flavored. Other flavors include pineapple and watermelon.\n\nFreshly squeezed lime juice is the key ingredient. The most common lime in the United States is the thick-skinned Persian lime. However, margaritas in Mexico are generally made with Mexican limes (Key limes). These are small, thin-skinned limes and have more tart and an often bitter flavor compared to Persian limes.\n\nIn addition to being shaken and served \"up\" like other cocktails, margaritas can also be served as a blended ice slush similar to other tropical-inspired mixed drinks like the hurricane or piña colada. This variant is known as a frozen margarita. The ingredients can be poured over crushed ice in a kitchen blender, or for larger establishments that serve many of these, a large quantity of a \"house recipe\" of frozen margarita can be kept in a machine designed specifically for the purpose (but also commonly used to serve non-alcoholic slush drinks); a cylinder leading to a pour spout is kept below freezing temperature, but an impeller within the cylinder constantly churns the mix so it cannot freeze solid, and so it dispenses as a thick half-frozen slush. It was first served in La Jolla, when Albert Hernandez Sr. stopped using crushed ice and instead combined the ingredients in a blender in 1947. The first frozen margarita machine was invented on May 11, 1971, by Dallas, Texas restaurateur Mariano Martinez. The machine was originally a soft-serve ice cream machine and now sits in the Smithsonian National Museum of History.\n\nAlternate fruits and juice mixtures can also be used in a margarita. Fruits like mango, peach, strawberry, banana, melon, or raspberry are suitable for creating this drink. Many recipes call for a splash of orange juice. These days, margarita can be prepared in many different ways. When the word \"margarita\" is used by itself, it typically refers to the lime or lemon juice margarita, but when other juices are used, the fruits are typically added as adjectives in the name; with lime juice or lemon juice added to give it a characteristic margarita flavor (a wedge of lime is often added to the glass). Other varieties of margarita include fruit margarita, top-shelf margarita and virgin margarita.\n\nMargaritas may be served in a variety of glasses, most notably the eponymous margarita glass, a variant of the classic champagne coupe; this is particularly associated with blended fruit margaritas, and the glass is also used for dishes such as guacamole or shrimp cocktails. In formal settings margaritas are often served in a standard cocktail glass, while in informal settings, particularly with ice, margaritas may be served in an old fashioned glass.\n\nThe margarita cocktail was the \"Drink of the Month\" in \"Esquire\" magazine, December 1953, pg. 76:\n\nIt was further popularized by the 1977 song \"Margaritaville\" by Jimmy Buffett, and in 2004 it was described as \"the most popular mixed drink in America\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "172063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172063", "title": "Ribena", "text": "Ribena\n\nRibena ( ) is an English-origin brand of blackcurrant-based uncarbonated and carbonated soft drink and fruit drink concentrate. It was produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) until 2013, when the brand was sold to Suntory.\n\nThe brand originally had a strong reputation as a healthy product for children, stemming from its distribution to children as a vitamin C supplement during World War II by the British government. Beecham (a company that has been part of GSK since 2000) bought the brand in 1955 and developed many soft drink versions. A series of scandals in the 2000s, concerning vitamin C levels, sugar levels, and the amounts of actual fruit in some of the brands, damaged its reputation as a healthy product. By 2013, the brand was widely regarded as being similar to other soft drinks.\n\nIn 2013, annual worldwide sales were around £500 million. That year, GSK sold Ribena and another consumer line, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for £1.35 billion.\n\nIn April 2018, in the United Kingdom, Ribena's longstanding recipe was changed by the addition of artificial sweeteners in response to the introduction of a sugary drinks tax by the UK government.\n\nRibena was originally manufactured by the Bristol-based food and drink company HW Carter as a blackcurrant squash. Development research into pure fruit syrups for the manufacture of milkshakes had been done at the Long Ashton Agriculture and Horticulture Research Station in North Somerset using a pectinase enzyme process; Ribena was essentially invented there by Vernon Charley, a scientist at the University of Bristol in 1933. The blackcurrant variety was found to contain high levels of vitamin C. The drink was launched in 1938 under the name Ribena (from the botanical name for the blackcurrant, \"Ribes nigrum\").\n\nDuring the Second World War, other fruits rich in vitamin C, like oranges, became almost impossible to obtain in the United Kingdom, due to the U-boat campaign. Blackcurrant cultivation was encouraged by the Government, and the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942, almost the entire British blackcurrant crop was made into blackcurrant syrup (or cordial), almost all of it manufactured by Carters, and it was bought by the government and distributed to the nation's children for free, without the Ribena brand name, giving rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant flavourings in Britain.\n\nProduction moved to the new Royal Forest Factory at Coleford in the Forest of Dean in late 1947, where production takes place today.\n\nCarters was bought out by the Beecham Group in 1955. In 1989, The Beecham Group and SmithKline Beckman merged to form SmithKline Beecham, and in 2000, SmithKline Beecham and GlaxoWellcome merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).\n\nThrough the years GSK and its predecessors developed many soft drink versions of Ribena but it retained an image as a \"healthy food\" in the UK and other Commonwealth countries.\n\nIn 2001, a formulation of the diluted Ribena cordial, sold as Ribena Toothkind (and endorsed by the British Dental Association as being less damaging to teeth than other soft drinks), was judged by the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority to have been advertised in a misleading manner, and claims that the drink did not encourage tooth decay should be removed from the packaging. The opinion was upheld by a hearing in the High Court. In 2003, The Food Commission in the United Kingdom criticised the sugar levels in regular Ribena as contributing to childhood obesity.\n\nIn 2004, two high school students in New Zealand conducted a science experiment to determine the vitamin C levels of their favourite fruit drinks. They discovered that the \"Ready to Drink Ribena\" product they tested had undetectable levels of vitamin C, counter to the brand's reputation and to advertisements which said that \"the blackcurrants in Ribena contain four times the vitamin C of oranges\". They contacted GSK, which did not respond to them, and their story was picked up by the television consumer affairs show \"Fair Go\", which broadcast the story nationwide in October 2004. Following further testing, in March 2007, the New Zealand Commerce Commission brought 15 charges in the Auckland District Court against GlaxoSmithKline under the Fair Trading Act. In March 2007, GSK pleaded guilty to all 15 charges and was fined NZ$217,500 by Auckland District Court for misleading consumers, and were ordered to run a series of corrective advertisements and place a statement on its website. GSK maintained the issue only affects Australia and New Zealand, and Ribena products sold in other markets, such as the United Kingdom, contain the levels of vitamin C stated on the product label.\nIn 2007, a study conducted by the Australian Consumers' Association for \"Choice\" magazine in January 2007 reported that blackcurrant juice (from concentrate) only constituted 5% of the Ribena Fruit Drink product.\n\nBy 2013, the brand had annual worldwide sales of about £500 million, and was considered to be similar to other soft drinks. and GSK put Ribena, along with Lucozade, up for sale. The eventual sale, announced in September, was for £1.35 billion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "173155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173155", "title": "Public good", "text": "Public good\n\nIn economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it, and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others or the goods can be effectively consumed simultaneously by more than one person. This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree.\n\nPublic goods include knowledge, official statistics, national security, common language(s), flood control systems, lighthouses, and street lighting. Public goods that are available everywhere are sometimes referred to as global public goods. There is an important conceptual difference between the sense of \"a\" public good, or public \"goods\" in economics, and the more generalized idea of \"the public good\" (or common good, or public interest), \"a shorthand signal for shared benefit at a societal level\". Examples of public good knowledge is mens, womens and youth health awareness, environmental issues, such as maintaining a nation's biodiversity, provision of welfare services and safety nets for future generations, sharing and interpreting contemporary history with a cultural lexicon, particularly about protected cultural heritage sites and monuments, popular and entertaining tourist attractions, libraries and universities. \n\nMany public goods may at times be subject to excessive use resulting in negative externalities affecting all users; for example air pollution and traffic congestion. Public goods problems are often closely related to the \"free-rider\" problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it. Thus, the good may be under-produced, overused or degraded. Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be club goods or private goods; exclusion mechanisms include copyright, patents, congestion pricing, and pay television.\n\nThere is a good deal of debate and literature on how to measure the significance of public goods problems in an economy, and to identify the best remedies.\n\nIn a non-economic sense, the term is often used to describe something that is useful for the public generally, such as education and infrastructure, although these are not \"public goods\" in the economic sense.\n\nPaul A. Samuelson is usually credited as the first economist to develop the theory of public goods. In his classic 1954 paper \"The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure\", he defined a public good, or as he called it in the paper a \"collective consumption good\", as follows:\n\n[goods] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other individual's consumption of that good...\n\nThis is the property that has become known as \"non-rivalry\". A \"pure public good\" exhibits a second property called \"non-excludability\": that is, it is impossible to exclude any individuals from consuming the good.\n\nHowever, many goods may satisfy the two public good conditions (\"non-rivalry\" and \"non-excludability\") only to a certain extent or only some of the time. These goods are known as \"impure public goods\".\n\nThe opposite of a public good is a \"private good\", which does not possess these properties. A loaf of bread, for example, is a private good; its owner can exclude others from using it, and once it has been consumed, it cannot be used again.\n\nA good that is rivalrous but \"non-excludable\" is sometimes called a \"common-pool resource\". Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the \"public goods problem\" for this case is the 'tragedy of the commons'. For example, it is so difficult to enforce restrictions on deep-sea fishing that the world's fish stocks can be seen as a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing.\n\nElinor Ostrom proposed additional modifications to the classification of goods to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals\n\n\nThe definition of non-excludability states that it is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of information goods have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. Official statistics provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable. Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. Copyrights and patents both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the \"lost revenue\" of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good.\n\nDebate has been generated among economists whether such a category of \"public goods\" exists. Steven Shavell has suggested the following:\nwhen professional economists talk about public goods they do \"not\" mean that there are a general category of goods that share the same economic characteristics, manifest the same dysfunctions, and that may thus benefit from pretty similar corrective solutions...there is merely an infinite series of particular problems (some of overproduction, some of underproduction, and so on), each with a particular solution that cannot be deduced from the theory, but that instead would depend on local empirical factors.\n\nCommon confusion is that public goods are goods provided by the public sector. Although it is often the case that government is involved in producing public goods, this is not necessarily the case. Public goods may be \"naturally\" available. They may be produced by private individuals and firms, by non-state collective action, or they may not be produced at all.\n\nThe theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish with regard to the geographical region in which a good may be produced or consumed. However, some theorists such as Inge Kaul use the term \"global public good\" for public goods which is non-rival and non-excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good which exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been held to be an example of a global public good, but also as a commons, the knowledge commons.\nGraphically, non-rivalry means that if each of several individuals has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This is in contrast to the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.\n\nSocial goods are defined as public goods that could be delivered as private goods, but are usually delivered by the government for various reasons, including social policy, and funded via public funds like taxes. Note that some writers have used the term \"public good\" to refer only to non-excludable \"pure public goods\" and refer to excludable public goods as \"club goods\".\n\nCommon examples of public goods include: defence, public fireworks, lighthouses, clean air and other environmental goods, and information goods, such as official statistics, software development, authorship, and invention. Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but cannot be classified as public goods since they do not fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability \"is\" possible, but they do still fit some of the characteristics of public goods.\n\nThe provision of a lighthouse is a standard example of a public good, since it is difficult to exclude ships from using its services. No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular ports, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees (Ronald Coase, \"The Lighthouse in Economics\" 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.\n\nTechnological progress can create new public goods. The most simple examples are street lights, which are relatively recent inventions (by historical standards). One person's enjoyment of them does not detract from other persons' enjoyment, and it currently would be prohibitively expensive to charge individuals separately for the amount of light they presumably use. Official statistics are another example. The government's ability to collect, process and provide high-quality information to guide decision-making at all levels has been strongly advanced by technological progress. On the other hand, a public good's status may change over time. Technological progress can significantly impact excludability of traditional public goods: encryption allows broadcasters to sell individual access to their programming. The costs for electronic road pricing have fallen dramatically, paving the way for detailed billing based on actual use.\n\nSome question whether defense is a public good. Murray Rothbard argues: national defense' is surely not an absolute good with only one unit of supply. It consists of specific resources committed in certain definite and concrete ways—and these resources are necessarily scarce. A ring of defense bases around New York, for example, cuts down the amount possibly available around San Francisco.\" Jeffrey Rogers Hummel and Don Lavoie note, \"Americans in Alaska and Hawaii could very easily be excluded from the U.S. government's defense perimeter, and doing so might enhance the military value of at least conventional U.S. forces to Americans in the other forty-eight states. But, in general, an additional ICBM in the U.S. arsenal can simultaneously protect everyone within the country without diminishing its services\".\n\nPublic goods are not restricted to human beings. It is one aspect of the study of cooperation in biology.\n\nPublic goods provide a very important example of market failure, in which market-like behavior of individual gain-seeking does not produce efficient results. The production of public goods results in positive externalities which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the free rider problem, or occasionally, the \"easy rider problem\" (because consumers' contributions will be small but non-zero). If too many consumers decide to \"free-ride\", private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need.\n\nThe free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as \"homo economicus\": purely rational and also purely selfish—extremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider.\n\nFor example, consider national defense, a standard example of a pure public good. Suppose \"homo economicus\" thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all of the millions of other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.\n\nOn the other hand, the free rider knows that he or she cannot be excluded from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or mercenaries). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently. Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the \"demand revelation problem\"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good. This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since benefit-cost analyses are being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the ungenerated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations.\n\nIn the case of information goods, an inventor of a new product may benefit all of society, but hardly anyone is willing to pay for the invention if they can benefit from it for free. In the case of an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.\n\nAn assurance contract is a contract in which participants make a binding pledge to contribute to building a public good, contingent on a quorum of a predetermined size being reached. Otherwise the good is not provided and any monetary contributions are refunded.\n\nA dominant assurance contract is a variation in which an entrepreneur creates the contract and refunds the initial pledge plus an additional sum of money if the quorum is not reached. (The entrepreneur profits by collecting a fee if the quorum is reached and the good is provided.) In game-theoretic terms this makes pledging to build the public good a dominant strategy: the best move is to pledge to the contract regardless of the actions of others.\nA \"Coasian solution\", named for the economist Ronald Coase, proposes that potential beneficiaries of a public good can negotiate to pool their resources and create it, based on each party's self-interested willingness to pay. His treatise, \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960), argued that if the transaction costs between potential beneficiaries of a public good are low—that it is easy for potential beneficiaries to find each other and organize a pooling their resources based upon the good's value to each of them—that public goods could be produced without government action.\n\nMuch later, Coase himself wrote that while what had become known as the Coase Theorem had explored the implications of zero transaction costs, he had actually intended to use this construct as a stepping-stone to understand the real world of positive transaction costs, corporations, legal systems and government actions:I examined what would happen in a world in which transaction costs were assumed to be zero. My aim in doing so was not to describe what life would be like in such a world but to provide a simple setting in which to develop the analysis and, what was even more important, to make clear the fundamental role which transaction costs do, and should, play in the fashioning of the institutions which make up the economic system.Coase also wrote:The world of zero transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave. What I did in \"The Problem of Social Cost\" was simply to shed light on some of its properties. I argued in such a world the allocation of resources would be independent of the legal position, a result which Stigler dubbed the \"Coase theorem.Thus, while Coase himself appears to have considered the \"Coase theorem\" and Coasian solutions as simplified constructs to ultimately consider the real 20th-century world of governments and laws and corporations, these concepts have become attached to a world where transaction costs were much lower, and government intervention would unquestionably be less necessary.\n\nA minor alternative, especially for information goods, is for the producer to refuse to release a good to the public until payment to cover costs is met. Author Stephen King, for instance, authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating that he would not release subsequent chapters unless a certain amount of money was raised. Sometimes dubbed \"holding for ransom\", this method of public goods production is a modern application of the street performer protocol for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.\n\nOne of the purest Coasian solutions today is the new phenomenon of Internet crowdfunding. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts as well as social pressure. For example, on the Kickstarter site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met. Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors.\n\nIf voluntary provision of public goods will not work, then the solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves each of us from our own tendency to be a free rider, while also assuring us that no one else will be allowed to free ride. One frequently proposed solution to the problem is for governments or states to impose taxation to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because \"good government\" is itself a public good. Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum. These issues are studied by public choice theory and public finance.\n\nSometimes the government provides public goods using \"unfunded mandates\". An example is the requirement that every car be fit with a catalytic converter. This may be executed in the private sector, but the end result is predetermined by the state: the individually involuntary provision of the public good clean air. Unfunded mandates have also been imposed by the U.S. federal government on the state and local governments, as with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example.\n\nRegardless, some argue that the role of the government is to provide vital goods to all individuals, some of which they cannot obtain privately. In order to ensure that government services are properly funded taxes are imposed. Although enforced taxes deter the free-rider problem, many contend that some goods should be excluded and provided privately. However, this is not possible with all goods such as pure public goods that are inseparable and inclusive, thus arguably requiring \"provision by public means\".\n\nA government may subsidize production of a public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result in some form of a competitive market. The potential for cronyism (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, principal–agent problems can arise between the citizens and the government or between the government and the subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken to address it can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.\n\nSubsidies can also be used in areas with a potential for non-individualism: For instance, a state may subsidize devices to reduce air pollution and appeal to citizens to cover the remaining costs.\n\nSimilarly, a joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be \"tied\" to a donation to a charity (public good). It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).\n\nThe study of collective action shows that public goods are still produced when one individual benefits more from the public good than it costs him to produce it; examples include benefits from individual use, intrinsic motivation to produce, and business models based on selling complement goods. A group that contains such individuals is called a privileged group. A historical example could be a downtown entrepreneur who erects a street light in front of his shop to attract customers; even though there are positive external benefits to neighboring nonpaying businesses, the added customers to the paying shop provide enough revenue to cover the costs of the street light.\n\nThe existence of privileged groups may not be a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as underproduction of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.\n\nAn example of the privileged group solution could be the Linux community, assuming that users derive more benefit from contributing than it costs them to do it. For more discussion on this topic see also Coase's Penguin.\n\nAnother example is those musicians and writers who create music and writings for their own personal enjoyment, and publish because they enjoy having an audience. Financial incentives are not necessary to ensure the creation of these public goods. Whether this creates the correct production level of writings and music is an open question.\n\nAnother method of overcoming the free rider problem is to simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not need to worry about free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.\n\nWhile the purchase of all potential free riders may solve the problem of underproduction due to free riders in smaller markets, it may simultaneously introduce the problem of underproduction due to monopoly. Additionally, some markets are simply too large to make a buyout of all beneficiaries feasible—this is particularly visible with public goods that affect everyone in a country.\n\nAnother solution, which has evolved for information goods, is to introduce exclusion mechanisms which turn public goods into club goods. One well-known example is copyright and patent laws. These laws, which in the 20th century came to be called intellectual property laws, attempt to remove the natural non-excludability by prohibiting reproduction of the good. Although they can address the free rider problem, the downside of these laws is that they imply private monopoly power and thus are not Pareto-optimal.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the patent rights given to pharmaceutical companies encourage them to charge high prices (above marginal cost) and to advertise to convince patients to persuade their doctors to prescribe the drugs. Likewise, copyright provides an incentive for a publisher to act like The Dog in the Manger, taking older works out of print so as not to cannibalize revenue from the publisher's own new works.\n\nThe laws also end up encouraging patent and copyright owners to sue even mild imitators in court and to lobby for the extension of the term of the exclusive rights in a form of rent seeking.\n\nThese problems with the club-good mechanism arise because the underlying marginal cost of giving the good to more people is low or zero, but, because of the limits of price discrimination those who are unwilling or unable to pay a profit-maximizing price do not gain access to the good.\n\nIf the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, club goods can emerge naturally. James M. Buchanan showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.\n\nOn the other hand, the inefficiencies and inequities of club goods exclusions sometimes cause potentially excludable club goods to be treated as public goods, and their production financed by some other mechanism. Examples of such \"natural\" club goods include natural monopolies with very high fixed costs, private golf courses, cinemas, cable television and social clubs. This explains why many such goods are often provided or subsidized by governments, co-operatives or volunteer associations, rather than being left to be supplied by profit-minded entrepreneurs. These goods are often known as \"social goods\".\n\nJoseph Schumpeter claimed that the \"excess profits\", or profits over normal profit, generated by the copyright or patent monopoly will attract competitors that will make technological innovations and thereby end the monopoly. This is a continual process referred to as \"Schumpeterian creative destruction\", and its applicability to different types of public goods is a source of some controversy. The supporters of the theory point to the case of Microsoft, for example, which has been increasing its prices (or lowering its products' quality), predicting that these practices will make increased market shares for Linux and Apple largely inevitable.\n\nA nation can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club. This is further studied in the Theory of the State.\n\nWhen enough people do not think like free-riders, the private and voluntary provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. Other public-spirited individuals don't do this and might even pick up existing litter. Reasons for the act could be that the person derives pleasure from helping their community, feels ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them, or could be emotionally attached to the public good. People unconsciously adapt their behavior to that of their peers; this is conformity. Even people who engaged in free-riding by littering elsewhere are less likely to if they see others hold on to their trash.\n\nSocial norms can be observed wherever people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, can also be applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks (\"flames\") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.\n\nExperimental literature suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do not contribute to the public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation. Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored. Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed. Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of other perfectly.\n\nOrganizations such as the Red Cross, public radio and television or a volunteer fire department provide public goods to the majority at the expense of a minority who voluntarily participate or contribute funds. Contributions to online collaborative media like Wikipedia and other wiki projects, and free software projects such as Linux are another example of relatively few contributors providing a public good (information) freely to all readers or software users.\n\nProposed explanations for altruistic behavior include biological altruism and reciprocal altruism. For example, voluntary groups such as labor unions and charities often have a federated structure, probably in part because voluntary collaboration emerges more readily in smaller social groups than in large ones (e.g., see Dunbar's number).\n\nWhile both biological and reciprocal altruism are observed in other animals, our species' complex social behaviors take these raw materials much farther. Philanthropy by wealthy individuals—some, such as Andrew Carnegie giving away their entire vast fortunes—have historically provided a multitude of public goods for others. One major impact was the Rockefeller Foundation's development of the \"Green Revolution\" hybrid grains that probably saved many millions of people from starvation in the 1970s. Christian missionaries, who typically spend large parts of their lives in remote, often dangerous places, have had disproportionate impact compared with their numbers worldwide for centuries. Communist revolutionaries in the 20th century had similar dedication and outsized impacts. International relief organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and Amnesty International have benefited millions, while also occasionally costing workers their lives. For better and for worse, humans can conceive of, and sacrifice for, an almost infinite variety of causes in addition to their biological kin.\n\nVoluntary altruistic organizations often motivate their members by encouraging deep-seated personal beliefs, whether religious or other (such as social justice or environmentalism) that are taken \"on faith\" more than proved by rational argument. When individuals resist temptations to free riding (e.g., stealing) because they hold these beliefs (or because they fear the disapproval of others who do), they provide others with public goods that might be difficult or impossible to \"produce\" by administrative coercion alone.\n\nOne proposed explanation for the ubiquity of religious belief in human societies is multi-level selection: altruists often lose out within groups, but groups with more altruists win. A group whose members believe a \"practical reality\" that motivates altruistic behavior may out-compete other groups whose members' perception of \"factual reality\" causes them to behave selfishly. A classic example is a soldier's willingness to fight for his tribe or country. Another example given in evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson's \"Darwin's Cathedral\" is the early Christian church under the late Roman Empire; because Roman society was highly individualistic, during frequent epidemics many of the sick died not of the diseases \"per se\" but for lack of basic nursing. Christians, who believed in an afterlife, were willing to nurse the sick despite the risks. Although the death rate among the nurses was high, the average Christian had a \"much better chance\" of surviving an epidemic than other Romans did, and the community prospered.\n\nReligious and non-religious traditions and ideologies (such as nationalism and patriotism) are in full view when a society is in crisis and public goods such as defense are most needed. Wartime leaders invoke their God's protection and claim that their society's most hallowed traditions are at stake. For example, according to President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address during the American Civil War, the Union was fighting so \"that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\". Such voluntary, if exaggerated, exhortations complement forcible measures—taxation and conscription—to motivate people to make sacrifices for their cause.\n\nThe Pareto optimum provision of a public good in a society is where the combined sum of the marginal rate of substitution between private goods and a given public good of all individuals is equal to the marginal rate of transformation. This contrasts to the Pareto optimality condition of private goods, in which each consumers' marginal rate of substitution is equal; as is the societies marginal rate of transformation.\n\nAn example is a community of just two consumers and the government is considering whether or not to build a public park. One person is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while the other is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 gain on its production since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225.\n\nRegardless of the method of providing public goods, the efficient level of such provision is still being subjected to economic analysis. For instance, the Samuelson condition calculates the efficient level of public goods production to be where the ratio of the marginal social cost of public and private goods production equals the ratio of the marginal social benefit of public and private goods production.\n\nAn important question regarding public goods is whether they should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm has been applied to public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently it has been shown that the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "174455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174455", "title": "Lentil", "text": "Lentil\n\nThe lentil (\"Lens culinaris\" or \"Lens esculenta\") is an edible legume. It is a bushy annual plant known for its lens-shaped seeds. It is about tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each.\n\nIn cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) are known as \"dal\". Usually eaten with rice or \"rotis\", the lentil is a dietary staple throughout the Indian subcontinent. As a food crop, the majority of world production comes from Canada, India and Australia.\n\nThe cultivated lentil \"Lens culinaris\" was derived from its wild subspecies \"L. culinaris subsp. orientalis\", although other species may also have contributed some genes, according to Jonathan Sauer (\"Historical Geography of Crop Plants\", 2017.) Unlike their wild ancestors, domesticated lentil crops have indehiscent pods and nondormant seeds.\n\nLentils are the oldest pulse crop known, and among the earliest crops domesticated in the Old World, having been found as carbonized remains alongside human habitations dating to 11,000 BC in Greece. The lentil is indigenous to Western and Central Asia.\n\nMany different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil; lentil (English), \"adas\" (Arabic),\" mercimek\" (Turkish), \"messer\" (Amharic), \"masser\" or \"massur\" (Hindi) and\" hiramame \"(Japanese) are the most common names.\n\nThe first use of the word lens to designate a specific genus was in the 16th century by the botanist Tournefort.\n\nThe genus \"Lens\" is part of the subfamily Faboideae which is contained in the flowering plant family Fabaceae or commonly known as legume or bean family, of the order Fabales in the kingdom Plantae.\n\n\"Lens\" is a small genus which consists of the cultivated \"L. culinaris\" and six related wild taxa. Among the different taxa of wild lentils, \"L. orientalis\" is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and is now generally classified as \"L. culinaris\" subsp. \"orientalis\". Therefore, the genus \"Lens\" comprises seven taxa in six species:\n\nLentil is hypogeal, which means the cotyledons of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.\n\nThe plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from 30 to 50 cm (10 to 20 in) in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The rachis bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into tendrils, whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If stipules are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about 1.5 cm long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about 0.5 cm in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds.\n\nLentils are self-pollinating. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers are open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.\n\n\nIn 2016, global production of lentils was 6.3 million tonnes, led by Canada with 51% and India with 17% of the world total (table). \n\nSaskatchewan is the most productive growing region in Canada (95% of Canadian lentils grown). For 2016, Statistics Canada reported a national production yield of 3.2 million tonnes from harvested.\n\nThe Palouse region of eastern Washington and the Idaho panhandle, with its commercial center at Pullman, Washington, constitutes the most important lentil-producing region in the United States. Montana and North Dakota are also significant lentil growers.\n\nLentils can grow on various soil types, from sand to clay loam, growing best in deep sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. A soil pH around 7 would be the best. Lentils do not tolerate flooding or water-logged conditions.\n\nLentils improve the physical properties of soils and increase the yield of succeeding cereal crops. Biological nitrogen fixation or other rotational effects could be the reason for higher yields after lentils\".\"\n\nThe conditions under which lentils are grown differ across different growing regions. In the temperate climates lentils are planted in the winter and spring under low temperatures and vegetative growth occurs in later spring and the summer. Rainfall during this time is not limited. In the subtropics, lentils are planted under relatively high temperatures at the end of the rainy season, and vegetative growth occurs on the residual soil moisture in the summer season. Rainfall during this time is limited. In West Asia and North Africa, some lentils are planted as a winter crop before snowfall. Plant growth occurs during the time of snow melting. Under such cultivation, seed yields are often much higher.\n\nThe lentil requires a firm, smooth seedbed with most of the previous crop residues incorporated. For the seed placement and for later harvesting it is important that the surface is not uneven with large clods, stones, or protruding crop residue. It is also important that the soil is made friable and weed-free so that seeding could be done at a uniform depth.\n\nThe plant densities for lentils vary between genotypes, seed size, planting time and growing conditions and also from region to region. In south Asia a seed rate of 30–40 kg/ha is recommended. In west Asia countries a higher seed rate is recommended and also leads to a higher yield. The seeds should be sown 3–4 cm deep. In agriculturally mechanized countries, lentils are planted using grain drills, but many other areas still hand broadcast.\n\nIn intercropping systems – a practice commonly used in lentil cultivation – herbicides may be needed to assure crop health. Similar to many legume crops, lentils can fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil with specific rhizobia. Lentils grow well under low fertilizer input conditions, although phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur may be used for nutrient-poor soils.\n\nBelow is a list of the most common lentil diseases.\n\nA combination of gravity, screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils based on shape and density. After destoning, they may be sorted by a color sorter and then packaged.\n\nA major part of the world’s red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step. These lentils are dehulled, split and polished. In south Asia, this process is called dhal milling. The moisture content of the lentils prior dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency. The hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7% of the total seed weight, which is lower than most legumes. Lentil flour can be produced by milling the seeds, like cereals.\n\nLentils are consumed in many ways. They can be eaten soaked, germinated, boiled, fried and baked. The most common preparation method is boiling. The seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the variety; shorter for small varieties with the husk removed, such as the common red lentil. Most varieties have a distinctive, earthy flavor. Lentils with husks remain whole with moderate cooking; lentils without husks tend to disintegrate into a thick purée, which leads to quite different dishes. The composition of lentils leads to a high emulsifying capacity which can be even increased by dough fermentation in bread making.\n\nLentils are used worldwide to cook many different dishes. Lentil dishes are most widespread throughout South Asia, the Mediterranean regions and West Asia.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, lentil curry is part of the everyday diet, eaten with both rice and roti. Boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries. They are also used as stuffing in dal parathas and puri for breakfast or snacks. Lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets. Lentil flour is used to prepare several different bread varieties, such as papadum.\n\nThey are frequently combined with rice, which has a similar cooking time. A lentil and rice dish is referred to in Levantine countries as \"mujaddara\" or \"mejadra\". In Iran, rice and lentil is served with fried raisin; this dish is called \"adas polo\". Rice and lentils are also cooked together in \"khichdi\", a popular dish in the Indian subcontinent (India and Pakistan); a similar dish, \"kushari\", made in Egypt, is considered one of two national dishes.\n\nLentils are used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious soup all over Europe and North and South America, sometimes combined with some form of chicken or pork. In western countries, cooked lentils are often used in salads.\n\nLentils are commonly eaten in Ethiopia in a stew-like dish called \"kik\", or \"kik wot\", one of the dishes people eat with Ethiopia's national food, \"injera\" flatbread. Yellow lentils are used to make a non-spicy stew, which is one of the first solid foods Ethiopian women feed their babies.\n\nLentils were a chief part of the diet of ancient Iranians, who consumed lentils daily in the form of a stew poured over rice.\n\nAccording to the USDA National Nutrient Database, 100 g of raw lentils (variety unspecified) provide 353 calories; the same weight of cooked lentils provides 116 calories. Raw lentils are 8% water, 63% carbohydrates including 11% dietary fiber, 25% protein, and 1% fat (table). Lentils are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients, including folate (120% DV), thiamin (76% DV), pantothenic acid (43% DV), vitamin B (42% DV), phosphorus (40% DV), iron (50% DV), and zinc (35%), among others (table). When lentils are cooked by boiling, protein content declines to 9% of total composition, and B vitamins and minerals decrease due to the overall water content increasing (protein itself is not lost). Lentils have the second-highest ratio of protein per calorie of any legume, after soybeans. Lentils contain the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe low levels of readily digestible starch (5%) and high levels of slowly digested starch make lentils of potential value to people with diabetes. The remaining 65% of the starch is a resistant starch classified as RS1. A minimum of 10% in starch from lentils escapes digestion and absorption in the small intestine (therefore called \"resistant starch\"). Additional resistant starch is synthesized from gelatinized starch, during cooling, after the lentils were cooked.\n\nLentils also have antinutrient factors, such as trypsin inhibitors and a relatively high phytate content. Trypsin is an enzyme involved in digestion, and phytates reduce the bioavailability of dietary minerals. The phytates can be reduced by prolonged soaking and fermentation or sprouting.\n\nAlthough lentils have been an important crop for centuries, lentil breeding and genetic research has a relatively short history compared to many other crops. Since the inception of The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) breeding programme in 1977 significant gains have been made. It supplies landraces and breeding lines for countries around the world, supplemented by other programmes in both developing (e.g. India) and developed (e.g. Australia and Canada) countries. In recent years, such collaborations among breeders and agronomists are becoming increasingly important.\n\nThe focus lies on high yielding and stable cultivars for diverse environments to match the demand of a growing population. In particular, progress in quantity and quality as well as in the resistance to disease and abiotic stresses are the major breeding aims. Several varieties have been developed applying conventional breeding methodologies. Serious genetic improvement for yield has been made, however, the full potential of production and productivity could not yet be tapped due to several biotic and abiotic stresses.\n\nWild \"Lens\" species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop. The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned \"L. nigricans\" and \"L. orientalis\" possess morphological similarities to the cultivated \"L. culinaris\". But only \"L. culinaris\" and \"L. culinaris\" subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybridisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability \"Lens\" species can be divided into three gene pools: \n\n\nCrosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, plant growth regulators and/or embryo rescue allows the growth of viable hybrids between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a backcrossing programme. Thus, mutagenesis is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are micro-propagation using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.\n\n\n"}

It can be made from cow's, ewe's, or goat's milk. Tommes are normally produced from the skimmed milk left over after the cream has been removed to produce butter and richer cheeses, or when there is too little milk to produce a full cheese. As a result, they are generally low in fat. However, Tomme de Boudane and Tomme de Revard can contain as much as 20–40% fat.

It first appeared in late 1934, invented by Donn Beach at his Hollywood \"Don the Beachcomber\" restaurant. It was popularized on the East coast soon afterwards at the 1939 New York World's Fair. \n\nLegend has it that Donn Beach originally concocted the Zombie to help a hung-over customer get through a business meeting. The customer returned several days later to complain that he had been turned into a zombie for his entire trip. Its smooth, fruity taste works to conceal its extremely high alcoholic content. \"Don the Beachcomber\" restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece because of their potency, which Beach said could make one \"like the walking dead.\"\n\nAccording to the original recipe, the Zombie cocktail included three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and \"Don's Mix\", a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice.\n\nBeach was very cautious with the recipes of his original cocktails. His instructions for his bartenders contained coded references to ingredients, the contents of which were only known to him. Beach had reason to worry; a copy of the Zombie was served at the 1939 New York World's Fair by a man trying to take credit for it named Monte Proser (later of the mob-tied Copacabana).\n\nBeach's original recipes for the Zombie and other Tiki drinks have been published in \"Sippin' Safari\" by Jeff \"Beachbum\" Berry. Berry researched the origins of many Tiki cocktails, interviewing bartenders from Don the Beachcomber's and other original Tiki places and digging up other original sources. Mostly notably, \"Sippin' Safari\" details Beach's development of the Zombie with three different recipes dating from 1934 to 1956.\n\nThe Zombie was occasionally served heated (a drink more commonly known today as the I.B.A. Hot Zombie), as outlined by the Catering Industry Employee (CIE) journal: \"Juice of 1 lime, unsweetened pineapple juice, bitters, 1 ounce heavily bodied rum, 2 ounces of Gold Label rum, 1 ounce of White Label rum, 1 ounce of apricot-flavored brandy, 1 ounce of papaya juice\"\n\nDue to the popularity of the cocktail during the Tiki craze and the fact that Beach kept his recipe secret and occasionally altered it, there are many variations of the Zombie served at other restaurants and bars (some tasting nothing like the original cocktail). Use of the word Zombie also began to be used at other tiki themed establishments, such as at the Zombie Hut and \"Zombie Village\".\n\nTrader Vic also listed a recipe for the Zombie in his 1947 \"Bartender's Guide\". Other competitors created drinks linked to the zombie. At Stephen Crane's Chicago Kon-Tiki Ports restaurant they featured a drink on the menu called \"The Walking Dead\": \"Makes the dead walk and talk. For those who want immediate action - meet the first cousin to the famous 'Zombie'. Demerara 151 rum. 90¢.\"\n\n"}

In UK English, crackers are sometimes called water biscuits, savoury biscuits or biscuits. Flavorings or seasonings, such as salt, herbs, seeds or cheese, may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top before baking. Crackers are often branded as a nutritious and convenient way to consume a staple food or cereal grain. \n\nCrackers can be eaten on their own, but can also accompany other food items, particularly as or with appetizers - such as cheese or meat slices; dips; or soft spreads such as jam, butter, or peanut butter. Bland or mild crackers are sometimes used as a palate cleanser in food product testing or flavor testing, between samples. Crackers may also be crumbled and added to soup. The modern cracker is somewhat similar to nautical ship's biscuits, military hardtack, chacknels, and sacramental bread. Other early versions of the cracker can be found in ancient flatbreads, such as lavash, pita, matzo, flatbrød, and crisp bread. Asian analogues include papadum and senbei.\n\nThe holes in crackers are called \"docking\" holes. The holes are poked in the dough with something pointed, such as a fork, to stop overly large air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking. Crackers come in many shapes and sizes - round, rectangular, triangular, or irregular.\n\nIn American English, the name \"cracker\" usually refers to savory and/or salty flat biscuits, whereas the term \"cookie\", or \"biscuit\" in UK English, while similar to a cracker in appearance and texture, means it is sweet. Crackers are also generally made differently: crackers are made by layering dough, while cookies, besides the addition of sugar, usually use a chemical leavening agent, may contain eggs, and in other ways are made more like a cake. Crackers sometimes have cheese or spices as ingredients, or even chicken stock. \n\nSaltines and oyster crackers are often used in or served with soup. Additional types of crackers include cream crackers and water biscuits.\n\nCheese crackers are prepared using cheese as a main ingredient. Commercial examples include Cheez-It, Cheese Nips and Goldfish.\n\nGraham crackers and digestive biscuits are also treated more like cookies than crackers, although they were both invented for their supposed health benefits, and graham crackers are sweet.\n\nMock apple pie is made using Ritz (or similar) crackers.\n\nCracker brands include Bremner Wafers, Captain's Wafers, Cheese Nips, Club Crackers, Handi-Snacks, In a Biskit, Town House crackers, Ritz Crackers, Stoned Wheat Thins, Triscuit, TUC and Wheat Thins, among others. Such crackers are sometimes spread with cheese, pâté, or mousse.\n\n"}

Bobbins are typically found in sewing machines, cameras, and within electronic equipment. In non-electrical applications the bobbin is used for tidy storage without tangles. \n\nIn electrical applications a coil of wire carrying a current has important magnetic properties as solenoids.\n\nAs used in spinning, weaving, knitting, sewing, or lacemaking, the bobbin provides temporary or permanent storage for yarn and may be made of plastic, metal, bone, or wood.\n\nBobbin lacemaking is a handcraft which requires the winding of yarn onto a temporary storage spindle made of wood (or, in earlier times, bone) often turned on a lathe. Exotic woods are extremely popular with contemporary lacemakers.\n\nMany lace designs require dozens of bobbins at any one time. \n\nBoth traditional and contemporary bobbins may be decorated with designs, inscriptions, or pewter or wire inlays. Often, the bobbins are 'spangled' to provide additional weight to keep the thread in tension. A hole is drilled near the base to enable glass beads and other ornaments to be attached by a loop of wire. These spangles provide a means of self-expression in the decoration of a tool of the craft. Antique and unique bobbins, sometimes spangled, have become highly sought after by collectors.\n\nElectrical transformers, inductors and relay coils use bobbins as permanent container for the wire to form and retain shape, and to ease assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. The bobbin may be made of thermoplastic or thermosetting (for example, phenolic) materials. This plastic often has to have a TÜV, UL or other regulatory agency flammability rating for safety reasons.\n\nThe term \"bobbins\" also appears in northern English slang, meaning \"rubbish\", i.e. something worthless or incorrect. Taken from the cockney \"bobbins of cotton\", meaning \"rotten\". This may be related to the contemporary British slang usage, where \"bobbins\" can be used to denote something negative, particularly in theatrical circles.\n\n\n"}

As of late February 2019, it is no longer availible in Australia and New Zeland.\n\nIt is sold in the United Kingdom & Ireland as 'Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel'.\n\nOne of the advertising campaigns for Caramilk bars revolved around the question of how the centre of the confection was put into the chocolate flavoured exterior. This theme led to the production of over fifteen separate television advertisements since the candy was introduced, making the series one of the most productive advertising efforts in Canadian history. The \"Caramilk Secret\" ad campaign was conceived by Gary Prouk when he was at Doyle Dane Bernbach. When Prouk left DDB to join Scali McCabe Sloves, the Cadbury account went with him. One notable advertisement involved two conehead aliens who were complimenting each other on successfully concealing the secret from humans, and also creating some of earth's other long-standing works of wonder (e.g. the pyramids).\n\nAnother ad, featuring Leonardo da Vinci drawing the Mona Lisa as she eats a Caramilk, has won a Clio award.\n\nCaramilk bars are produced at one location, the company's Gladstone Chocolate Factory in Toronto.\n\nCaramilk bars contain unsweetened chocolate and cocoa butter but are labelled as candy bars since only solid chocolate bars may be labelled as chocolate bars in Canada.\n\nCaramilk NZ and Australia version\nMilk, sugar, cocoa butter, milk solids, emulsifiers, flavours.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a bar similar in premise (caramel-filled chocolate) but differing considerably in taste, shape, ingredients and packaging is sold as Cadbury Dairy Milk Caramel.\nIn New Zealand, a bar similar to the United Kingdom product is sold as the Caramello variant of the Cadbury Dairy Milk line of blocks.\nIn the early-mid-1990s, a bar was sold in New Zealand by Cadbury under the name Caramilk which was solid caramel-flavoured chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, a similar bar is produced under license by The Hershey Company and sold under the brand Cadbury's Caramello.

Over the years it has become a luxury dish, popular in the 1950s and 1960s in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIt consists of an end cut of steak, such as scotch fillet. Pockets in the meat are made by small cuts, into which oysters are stuffed and sutured with toothpicks or thread. As the dish is broiled, the flavour of the fresh oysters permeates the steak and blends with the juice of the tender meat.\n\nThe combination of beef and oysters is traditional and formed part of the everyday diet of oyster fisherman in Swansea in the mid 1800s . The earliest specific reference in the United States was a newspaper in 1891, which may indicate a connection with carpetbaggers or to gluttony. The earliest specific Australian reference is a printed recipe from between 1899 and 1907. Another recipe from 1909 includes cayenne pepper as an ingredient, which may indicate an American origin. The more recent Australian versions typically use Worcestershire sauce, as does the local version of Oysters Kilpatrick.\n\nIt is sometimes served standing up like a miniature mountain. A strip of bacon may be wrapped around the serving and surrounded by peeled and browned baby potato halves.

The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of \"A. saccharum\", the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.\n\nA few other (but not all) species of maple (\"Acer\") are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder or Manitoba maple (\"Acer negundo\"), the silver maple (\"A. saccharinum\"), and the bigleaf maple (\"A. macrophyllum\"). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.\n\nMaple sugar is what remains after the sap of the sugar maple is boiled for longer than is needed to create maple syrup or maple taffy. Once almost all the water has been boiled off, all that is left is a solid sugar. By composition, this sugar is about 90% sucrose, the remainder consisting of variable amounts of glucose and fructose. This is usually sold in pressed blocks or as a translucent candy. It is difficult to create as the sugar easily burns and thus requires considerable skill.\n\nIn Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.\n\nMaple sugar was the preferred form of maple by First Nations/American Indian peoples as the sugar could easily be transported and lasted a long time. It is called \"ziinzibaakwad\" by the Anishinaabeg. \"Blessing of the Bay\", the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver's works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot's 1755 \"Encyclopedie.\") and others.\n\nMaple sugar is used to flavor maple products and as an alternative to cane sugar.\n\n"}
{"id": "176565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176565", "title": "Hungarian cuisine", "text": "Hungarian cuisine\n\nHungarian or Magyar cuisine is the cuisine characteristic of the nation of Hungary and its primary ethnic group, the Magyars. Traditional Hungarian dishes are primarily based on meats, seasonal vegetables, fruits, fresh bread, dairy products and cheeses.\n\nHungarian cuisine is mostly continental Central European, with some elements from Eastern Europe such as the use of poppy, and the popularity of kefir and quark. Paprika, a quintessential spice and pepper is often associated with Hungary and is used prominently in a handful of dishes. Typical Hungarian food is heavy on dairy, cheese and meats, similar to that of neighboring West Slavic cuisines (Czech, Polish and Slovak). Chicken, pork and beef are very common, while turkey, duck, lamb, fish and game meats are also eaten but not as frequently (mostly on special occasions). Hungary is also famous for the high quality and relatively inexpensive salamis and sausages it produces primarily from pork, but also poultry, beef, etc.\n\nBread is perhaps the most important and basic part of the Hungarian diet. It is eaten at all meals and often as a side to a main dish. Before the fall of communism in 1990, white bread was a staple food, and Hungarians were very proud of the delicious bread widely available. After the change to capitalism, the quality of bread decreased as bakers tried to save on costs. Nevertheless, there was a backlash and many specialty bakers arose who strive to provide the high quality white bread available back then, as well as many new varieties. Not only bread, but numerous types of baked goods, such as buns and pastries both salty and sweet, often creatively filled, have proliferated in recent years. These can be found in the numerous bakeries all over Hungary.\n\nHungarians view main dishes as one of two types: either requiring a side dish (köret) or not requiring one. For the ones that require it, it would be very unusual to eat it without the side dish. Vice versa, if a side dish is not required it would be very unusual to order one. The side dish is most commonly potato prepared in different styles, but rice or steamed vegetables are also popular. Some foods have a customary side dish (i.e. \"csirkepaprikás\" (paprika chicken) is almost always eaten with noodles (\"nokedli\"), while others are completely flexible (i.e. \"rántott sajt\" (fried cheese) can take any kind). Some Hungarian dishes also have toppings or bread on the side considered almost mandatory, for example the sour cream and bread with \"töltött káposzta\" (stuffed cabbage).\n\nIn recent years, chefs have made Hungarian food into a creative art form, adding new ingredients and preparation styles that never existed in the past. As a result, Hungarian dishes prepared for tourists may seem quite unusual to Hungarians who have always eaten those foods in a traditional, less showy way.\n\nGoulash, the quintessential \"Hungarian\" dish, is actually not eaten very frequently, it's a traditional food. Other famous Hungarian meat stews include paprikás, a thicker stew with meat simmered in thick, creamy, paprika-flavored gravy, and pörkölt, a flavorful Hungarian stew with boneless meat (usually beef or pork), onion, and sweet paprika powder, both served with \"nokedli\" or galuska (small dumplings). In old-fashioned dishes, fruits such as plums and apricots are cooked with meat or in piquant sauces/stuffings for game, roasts and other cuts. Various kinds of noodles, dumplings, potatoes, and rice are commonly served as a side dish. Hungarian dry sausages (kolbász) and winter salami are also an integral part of Hungarian cuisine.\n\nOther characteristics of Hungarian cuisine are the soups, casseroles, desserts, and pastries and stuffed crêpes (\"palacsinta\"), with fierce rivalries between regional variations on the same dish (such as the Hungarian hot fish soup called fisherman's soup or \"halászlé\", cooked differently on the banks of Hungary's two main rivers: the Danube and the Tisza), \"palacsinta\" (pancakes served flambéed in dark chocolate sauce filled with ground walnuts) and Dobos Cake (layered sponge cake, with chocolate buttercream filling and topped with a thin layer of crunchy caramel).\n\nTwo remarkable elements of Hungarian cuisine that are hardly noticed by locals, but usually elicit much enthusiasm from foreigners, are the different forms of vegetable stews called \"főzelék\" as well as cold fruit soups, such as cold sour cherry soup ().\n\nHungarian cuisine uses a large variety of cheeses, but the most common are \"túró\" (a type of crumbly quark), cream cheeses, picante ewe-cheese (\"juhturó\"), the most common Hungarian cheeses like Karaván, , Pálpusztai and Emmentaler, Edam.\n\nIt is of worth to mention the wide selection of smoked pork products, which are a very important part of Hungarian cuisine. Many dishes get their character from the smoky taste of one or more of these ingredients. A broad selection of Hungarian smoked sausages, smoked ham, and smoked lard are also consumed without further preparation. These accompanied with bread and fresh vegetables, are often called 'cold dish', mainly consumed for breakfast or dinner, but sometimes offered as starter in restaurants.\n\nThe pickled (fermented) vegetable products are often used in the Hungarian cuisine. The main product is the \"savanyú káposzta\" (lit: sour-cabbage, sauerkraut) and soured peppers, gherkins, but also common the mix of cauliflower, green tomatoes, baby water melon, and some other vegetables too. These traditionally consumed at winter and often were the main source of vitamin-C throughout the cold months of winter. Some seasonal hearty dish such as \"Töltött káposzta\", \"Húsos káposzta\" or \"Korhely leves\" based on \"savanyú káposzta\". Classic Hungarian restaurants often offer some variations as side dish, a refreshing compliment to heavy dishes.\n\nHungarian food uses selected spices judiciously to add flavor, and despite the association of hot paprika with Hungary, most Hungarian dishes do not feature hot chili peppers intrinsically, and one may request not to include them in the dishes that use it. Hot chilis are only sometimes given as a garnish in traditional Hungarian cuisine, although dried hot chilis or hot chili paste may be given on the side for added, optional spiciness. This is in stark contrast to other nations associated with the chili pepper, like Mexico or Thailand, which use the hot variety much more frequently and typically also serve it as a garnish. In Hungary, the sweet (mild) paprika is much more common and is featured prominently in most dishes. The use of a thick sour cream called \"tejföl\" as a topping is another common feature in many dishes\".\"\n\nIn addition to various kinds of paprika and onions (raw, sweated, seared, browned or caramelized), other common flavor components include: dill, bay leaf, black peppercorn, caraway, coriander, cinnamon, garlic, horseradish, lemon juice and peel, marjoram, mustard (prepared), tarragon, oregano, parsley, vinegar, poppy seeds, and vanilla. Less used spices are anise, basil, chervil, chives, cloves, juniper berries, lovage, nutmeg, rosemary, savory, thyme, creeping thyme, and white peppercorn.\n\nHungarian cuisine has influenced the history of the Magyar people, and vice versa. The importance of livestock and the nomadic lifestyle of the Magyar people, as well as a hearkening to their steppe past, is apparent in the prominence of meat in Hungarian food and may be reflected in traditional meat dishes cooked over the fire like goulash (in Hungarian \"gulyás\", lit. \"cattleman's (meal)\"), \"pörkölt\" stew and the spicy fisherman's soup called \"halászlé\" are all traditionally cooked over the open fire in a \"bogrács\" (or cauldron). In the 15th century, King Matthias Corvinus and his Neapolitan wife Beatrice, influenced by Renaissance culture, introduced new ingredients such as sweet chestnut and spices such as garlic, ginger, mace, saffron and nutmeg, onion and the use of fruits in stuffings or cooked with meat. Some of these spices such as ginger and saffron are no longer used in modern Hungarian cuisine. At that time and later, considerable numbers of Saxons (a German ethnic group), Armenians, Italians, Jews, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire; dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa. Some cakes and sweets in Hungary show a strong German-Austrian influence. All told, modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Uralic components mixed with West Slavic, Balkan, Austrian and Germanic. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine.\n\nIn Hungary, people usually have a large breakfast. Hungarian breakfast generally is an open sandwich with fresh bread or toast, butter, cheese or different cream cheeses, \"túró\" cheese or \"körözött\" (Liptauer cheese spread), cold cuts such as ham, liver pâté (called \"májkrém\" or \"kenőmájas\"), bacon, salami, mortadella, sausages such as kabanos, beerwurst or different Hungarian sausages or kolbász.. Traditionally fresh tomatoes and green peppers (sometimes scallion, radish and cucumber) are served with these when they are in season. Eggs (fried, scrambled or boiled) may also be part of breakfast.\n\nSome types of meat that were commonly eaten in the past (such as beef tongue, \"disznósajt\" (head cheese) or \"véres hurka\" (similar to black pudding) are now more associated with the countryside as people turn to healthier diets.\n\nModern day Hungarians do not always eat this typical breakfast. For many, breakfast is a cup of milk, tea or coffee with pastries, a bun, a \"kifli\" or a \"strudel\" with jam or honey, or cereal, such as muesli and perhaps fruit. Children can have rice pudding (\"tejberizs\") or Semolina Cream (\"tejbegríz\") for breakfast topped with cocoa powder and sugar or with fruit syrup. Hot drinks are preferred for breakfast.\n\n\"Villásreggeli\" or brunch, (literally breakfast with fork) is a more luxurious big breakfast given on special occasions or holidays. Often guests are invited. Deviled eggs, cold steak, cold salads, salmon-omelet, pancakes, a spicy cheese spread made with sheep milk cheese called \"körözött\", caviar, foie gras, fruit salads, compote, fruit yogurts, fruit juices, champagne and pastries, cakes and cookies may be served.\n\nLunch is the major meal of the day, traditionally with several courses, but often just one course in modern times. Cold or hot appetizers may be served sometimes (for example fish, egg or liver), then soup. Soup is followed by a main dish. The main dish is a dish including meat, side dishes and salad (or pickled vegetables - paprika, cucumber, sauerkraut, etc.), which precedes the dessert. Fruit may follow. In Hungary, pancakes (or rather, crepes) may be served as a main dish or as a dessert but not for breakfast. Salad is typically served with meat dishes, made of lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, or some pickled variant of them. A simple thin sliced cucumber or tomato salad in vinaigrette is also typical. Salads such as Salade Olivier or potato salad are made of boiled potatoes, vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, mushrooms, fried or boiled meat or fish, in vinaigrette, aspic or mayonnaise. These salads are eaten as appetizers or even as a main course.\n\nSome people and children eat a light meal in the afternoon, called \"uzsonna\", usually an open sandwich, pastry, slice of cake or fruit.\n\nDinner is typically less important than lunch, and there is no typical Hungarian dinner. It may either be a lunch-type meal, with multiple courses and the same foods one would serve for lunch, or it could be the same as a traditional Hungarian breakfast, with bread, cold cuts, cheeses, tomatoes and peppers as described above. When dinner is an important occasion it will be prepared the same way and with the same courses a full lunch would be. When it's not an important occasion, it's a good time to eat leftovers.\n\nHungarian meal times are somewhat flexible. Typical times are as follows: Breakfast 6-9 am; Lunch 12 noon-2 pm; Dinner 6-9 pm\n\nFor Christmas, Hungarians have a fish soup called \"halászlé\". Other dishes may be served, such as roast goose, roast turkey or roast duck, cabbage rolls \"(töltött káposzta)\". Pastry roll filled with walnut or poppy seed called \"(bejgli)\" is a usual Christmas food, and candies and sweets used to decorate the Christmas tree, such as szaloncukor are eaten during all Christmas, when everybody picks them and eats them directly from the tree.\nOn New Year's Eve (\"Szilveszter\"), Hungarians traditionally celebrate with \"virsli\" (Vienna sausage, and lentil soup. On New Year's Day, it is common to eat either lentil soup or \"korhelyleves\", a meaty sauerkraut soup said to cure hangovers.\nEaster (\"Húsvét\") meals have few specialties, though some Hungarians (especially in Szabolcs County) make a special sweet yellow cheese, \"Sárga túró\", made with quark (túró) and eggs.\n\n\n\n\nHungarian wine dates back to at least Roman times, and that history reflects the country's position between the West Slavs and the Germanic peoples. The best-known wines are the white dessert wine called \"Tokaji Aszú\" (after the North-Eastern region of Hungary, Tokaj) and the red wines from Villány (Southern part of Hungary). Famous is also the wine called Bull's Blood (\"Egri Bikavér\"), a dark, full-bodied red wine. Hungarian fruit wines, such as redcurrant wine, are mild and soft in taste and texture.\n\nHungary's most notable liquors are \"Unicum\", a herbal bitters, and \"Pálinka\", a range of fruit brandies (plum and pear are popular). Also notable are the 21 brands of Hungarian mineral waters (for example \"Apenta\" and \"Kékkúti\"). Some of them have therapeutic value, such as \"Mira\".\n\n\"Traubi\" or \"Traubisoda\", is a soft drink based on an Austrian license produced in Balatonvilágos since 1971.\nBefore soft drinks became widely available, Hungarians made their own soft drinks called \"szörp\", which is a concentrate created from sugar and fruits such as the raspberry, currant or elderberry. This concentrate is diluted in either fresh or carbonated water.\n\n\n"}

Alternative names and variants include eggy bread (British usage), Bombay toast, German toast, gypsy toast, poor knights (of Windsor), Eggs-oh-Lay and Torrija.\n\nThe earliest known reference to French toast is in the \"Apicius\", a collection of Latin recipes dating to the 4th or 5th century, where it is described as simply \"aliter dulcia\" (\"another sweet dish\"). The recipe says to \"slice fine white bread, remove the crust, and break it into large pieces. Soak these pieces in milk and beaten egg, fry in oil, and cover with honey before serving.\"\n\nA fourteenth-century German recipe uses the name \"Arme Ritter\" (\"poor knights\"), a name also used in English and the Nordic languages. Also in the fourteenth century, Taillevent presented a recipe for \"tostées dorées\". Italian 15th-century culinary expert Martino da Como offers a recipe. \n\nThe usual French name is pain perdu (, \"lost bread\", reflecting its use of stale or otherwise \"lost\" bread — which gave birth to the metaphoric term \"pain perdu\" for sunk costs. It may also be called \"pain doré\", \"golden bread\", in Canada. There are fifteenth-century English recipes for \"pain perdu\".\n\nAn Austrian and Bavarian term is \"pafese\" or \"pofese\", from \"zuppa pavese\", referring to Pavia, Italy. The word \"soup\" in the dish's name refers to bread soaked in a liquid, a sop. In Hungary, it is commonly called \"bundáskenyér\" (lit. \"furry bread\").\n\nSlices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often whisked with milk or cream. Sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla are variously added to the mixture. The bread is then fried in butter or olive oil until browned and cooked through. Day-old bread is often used, both for its thrift and because it will soak up more egg mixture without falling apart.\n\nThe cooked slices may be served with sugar or sweet toppings such as jam, honey, fruit, or maple syrup.\n\nAccording to the \"Compleat Cook\" (1659) as quoted in the OED, the bread was dipped in milk only, with the egg mixture added afterwards.\n\nAlternatively, the bread may be soaked in wine, rosewater, or orange juice, either before or after cooking.\n\nIn both Portugal and Brazil, \"rabanadas\" are a traditional Christmas dessert. The bread is dipped in egg and milk and occasionally in wine and subsequently is fried. It is topped with sugar and cinnamon.\n\nIn France, it's called \"pain perdu\" and has a wide range of regional variations. It may be eaten as a dessert, or more rarely as an afternoon tea snack (\"goûter\"). It is very rarely eaten as a breakfast.\n\n\"Torrija\" is a similar recipe traditionally prepared in Spain for Lent and Holy Week. It is usually made by soaking stale bread in milk or wine with honey and spices. It is dipped in beaten egg and fried with olive oil. This cooking technique breaks down the fibres of the bread and results in a pastry with a crispy outside and smooth inside. It is often sprinkled with cinnamon as a final touch.\n\n\"Torrijas\" or \"torrejas\" were first mentioned by the Spanish composer, poet and playwright Juan del Encina (1468–1533) in his \"Cancionero\", published in 1496. In \"Anda acá pastor\" one reads: \"En cantares nuevos / gocen sus orejas, / miel e muchos huevos / para hacer \"torrejas\", / aunque sin dolor / parió al Redemptor\".\n\nHong Kong-style French toast () is typically prepared by combining multiple slices of bread with peanut butter or fruit jam filling, then dipped in beaten egg and deep fried. It is served with butter, and topped with golden syrup or honey. It is a typical offering in Hong Kong teahouses (\"cha chaan teng\"). Other types of filling that can be found are meat floss, kaya jam, ham or beef satay.\n\nFrench toast was popularly served in railroad dining cars of the early and mid-20th century. The Santa Fe was especially known for its French toast, and most of the railroads provided recipes of these and other dining car offerings to the public as a promotional feature.\n\nIn New Orleans Louisiana Creole cuisine, French toast is known as \"pain perdu\" and is most commonly served as a breakfast dish. The recipe calls for New Orleans-style French bread; the batter is an egg-based custard that may include spirits. Common toppings include cane syrup, strongly-flavored honey, or fruit syrups; a dusting of powdered sugar is also traditional.\n\n"}
{"id": "176614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176614", "title": "Amish friendship bread", "text": "Amish friendship bread\n\nAmish friendship bread is a type of bread or cake made from a sourdough starter that is often shared in a manner similar to a chain letter. The starter is a substitute for baking yeast and can be used to make many kinds of yeast-based breads, shared with friends, or frozen for future use. The sweet, cake-like Amish cinnamon bread is a common bread that is made from this starter; it is a simple, stirred quickbread that includes a substantial amount of sugar and vegetable oil, with a mild cinnamon flavor. It has characteristics of both pound cake and coffee cake. The flavor of the finished product can be altered by cinnamon being omitted.\n\nA common recipe using this starter suggests using one cup (240 ml) of it to make bread, keeping one cup to start a new cycle, and giving the remaining three cups to friends. The process of sharing the starter makes it somewhat like a chain letter. One cup of starter makes one standard loaf of bread.\n\nThere is no reason to think that the sweet, cinnamon-flavored bread has any connection to the Amish people, although the name is taken from them. According to Elizabeth Coblentz, a member of the Old Order Amish and the author of the syndicated column \"The Amish Cook\",\ntrue Amish friendship bread is \"just sourdough bread that is passed around to the sick and needy\".\n\nThe recipe for Amish cinnamon bread may have first been posted to the Internet in 1990, but the recipe itself is several decades old. Although the origin of Amish friendship bread is up for debate, it is similar to a cake called Herman friendship cake which was developed in Europe. Anne Byrn, who researched hundreds of historical recipes for her book American Cake remembers the friendship bread craze popping up in newspaper columns in the late 1980s, but thinks the recipe can be traced back much further. \n\nStarter can easily be created from scratch with a package of regular baker's yeast and the ingredients that are used to maintain it. Also it is possible to create it in a baker's kitchen through natural wild yeasts. Typically, however, a friend shares a cup of the liquid yeast culture with people who would like to make this bread. The starter is typically maintained by adding sugar, flour and milk every few days, although any source of water and food for the yeast will work.\n\nStarter bread is also known as \"mother bread\".\n\nA common cycle is based on the addition of one cup each of sugar, flour, and milk every five days, with bread baked and extra starter shared every tenth day. The ten-day cycle produces five cups of starter, which must be either used to bake bread, given away, or used to start a new cycle. A common suggestion is to bake one loaf of bread, give away three cups of starter, and to save the remaining one for the next cycle.\n\nIt is not necessary to wait the canonical ten days before using one cup of starter: a cup of starter can be used as a yeast substitute at any point. However, using starter on earlier days will result in a smaller quantity of starter at the end of the cycle. To avoid running out of starter, it is normal to feed the starter (add milk, sugar, and flour) before removing a cup for use, and most recipes assume that starter is always fed immediately before being removed. A five-day baking cycle feeds the starter every fifth day and uses the resulting mixture on that day to bake one or two loaves of bread (one cup per loaf). The remaining starter is reserved to begin the next five-day fermentation cycle.\n\nDespite common instructions to the contrary, the starter can be frozen for later use, and the cycle begun anew after thawing. The cycle can also be slowed to about half the normal fermentation rate by refrigerating the starter instead of allowing it to ferment at room temperature. Refrigeration is usually recommended if a few days' delay is desired.\n\n"}
{"id": "177267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177267", "title": "Suet", "text": "Suet\n\nSuet is the raw, hard fat of beef or mutton found around the loins and kidneys.\n\nSuet has a melting point of between 45 °C and 50 °C (113 °F and 122 °F) and congelation between 37 °C and 40 °C (98.6 °F and 104 °F). Its high smoke point makes it ideal for deep frying and pastry production.\n\nThe primary use of suet is to make tallow, although it is also used as an ingredient in cooking, especially in traditional puddings, such as British Christmas pudding. Suet is made into tallow in a process called rendering, which involves melting and extended simmering, followed by straining, cooling and usually by repeating the entire process. Unlike tallow, suet that is not pre-packed requires refrigeration in order to be stored for extended periods.\n\nIn the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile's husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role exporting mainly suet, ch'arki and leather to the other provinces of the viceroyalty. The importance of this trade led Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna to label the 17th century the \"century of suet\" (Spanish: \"siglo del sebo\").\n\nSuet is found in several traditional British dishes. Suet pastry is soft in contrast to the crispness of shortcrust pastry, which makes it ideal for certain sweet and savoury dishes. Suet is most widely used in sweet puddings, such as jam roly-poly and spotted dick. Savoury dishes include dumplings, which are made using a mixture of suet, flour and water rolled into balls that are added to stews during the final twenty minutes or so of cooking. In the savoury dish steak and kidney pudding, a bowl is lined with suet pastry, the meat is placed inside and a lid of suet pastry tightly seals the meat. The pudding is then steamed for approximately four hours before serving. Suet is also an ingredient of traditional fruit mince (known as 'mincemeat' in the UK).\n\nSuet should not be confused with beef dripping, which is the collected fat and juices from the roasting pan when cooking roast beef. Suet should also not be confused with all beef or sheep fat. It is normally the fat found around the heart and kidneys of cattle and sheep, and nowhere else in the animals.\n\nDue to its high energy content, suet is used by cold weather explorers to supplement the high daily energy requirement needed to travel in such climates. Typically the energy requirement is around 5,000–6,000 Cal per day for sledge hauling or dog-sled travelling. Suet is added to food rations to increase the fat content and help meet this high energy requirement.\n\nSuet can be bought in natural form in many supermarkets. As it is the fat from around the kidneys, the connective tissue, blood and other non-fat items must be removed. It then needs to be coarsely grated to make it ready to use. It must be kept refrigerated prior to use and used within a few days of purchase, just like meat.\n\nPre-packaged suet sold in supermarkets is dehydrated suet. It is mixed with flour to make it stable at room temperature. Because of this, some care is needed when using it for older recipes that call for fresh suet as the proportions of flour to fat can alter. Most modern recipes stipulate packaged suet.\n\nVegetable suet is available in supermarkets in the United Kingdom, made from fat such as palm oil combined with wheat flour (Atora/Tesco) or rice flour(Morrisons). It is used as a vegetarian substitute in recipes, but with slightly different results from animal suet. Vegetable suet is also available in light versions with lower fat content.\n\nConsumption of suet is forbidden according to the Jewish religion as it was reserved for ritual altar sacrifices. This restriction only applies to those animals which were used for sacrifices, and thus does not include wild animals such as deer.\n\nSuet-based bird feeders are favoured by woodpeckers, goldfinches, juncos, cardinals, thrushes, jays, kinglets, bluebirds, chickadees, nuthatches, wrens, and starlings.\n\nBird feed is commonly used in the form of cakes of suet, which can be made with other solid fats, such as lard. Rolled oats, bird seed, cornmeal, raisins, and unsalted nuts are often incorporated into the suet cakes.\n\n\n"}

The sour nature of this sauce led to the final \"su\" being spelled with the character meaning \"vinegar\".\n\nPonzu is made by simmering mirin, rice vinegar, \"katsuobushi\" flakes (from tuna), and seaweed (kombu) over medium heat. The liquid is then cooled, strained to remove the \"katsuobushi\" flakes, and finally the juice of one or more of the following citrus fruits is added: \"yuzu\", \"sudachi\", \"daidai\", \"kabosu\", or lemon.\n\nCommercial ponzu is generally sold in glass bottles, which may have some sediment. \"Ponzu shoyu\" is traditionally used as a dressing for \"tataki\" (lightly grilled, then chopped meat or fish), and also as a dip for \"nabemono\" (one pot dishes) such as shabu-shabu. It is used as a dip for sashimi. In the Kansai region, it is offered as a topping for \"takoyaki\".\n\n"}
{"id": "178574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178574", "title": "Baked beans", "text": "Baked beans\n\nBaked beans is a dish containing beans, sometimes baked but, despite the name, usually stewed, in a sauce. Most commercially canned baked beans are made from haricot beans, also known as navy beans (a variety of \"Phaseolus vulgaris\") in a sauce. In Ireland and Great Britain, a tomato sauce is most commonly used, and they are commonly eaten on toast or as part of a full English, Scottish, or Irish breakfast.\n\nAmerican Boston baked beans use a sauce prepared with molasses and salt pork, the popularity of which has led to the city's being nicknamed \"Beantown\". Beans in a tomato and brown sugar, sugar, or corn syrup sauce are widely available throughout the US. \n\nCanada's Quebec-style beans often use maple syrup. This style is also popular in states bordering Canada's eastern provinces.\n\nCanned baked beans are used as a convenience food. They may be eaten hot or cold, straight from the can, as they are already fully cooked.\n\nThe beans presently used to make baked beans are all native to South America and were introduced to Europe around 1528. The dish is commonly described as having a savory-sweet flavor and a brownish- or reddish-tinted white bean once baked, stewed, canned or otherwise cooked. According to alternative traditions, sailors brought cassoulet from the south of France or northern France, and the Channel Islands, where bean stews were popular. Most probably, a number of regional bean recipes coalesced and cross-fertilised in North America and ultimately gave rise to the baked bean culinary tradition familiar today.\n\nWhile many recipes today are stewed, traditionally beans were slow-baked in a ceramic or cast-iron beanpot. A tradition in Maine of \"bean hole\" cooking may have originated with the native Penobscot people and was later practiced in logging camps. A fire would be made in a stone-lined pit and allowed to burn down to hot coals, and then a pot with 11 pounds of seasoned beans would be placed in the ashes, covered over with dirt, and left to cook overnight or longer. These beans were a staple of Maine's logging camps, served at every meal.\n\nCanned beans, often containing pork, were among the first convenience foods, and it is in this form that they became exported and popularised by U.S. companies operating in the UK in the early 20th century. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration stated in 1996, \"It has for years been recognized by consumers generally that the designation 'beans with pork,' or 'pork and beans' is the common or usual name for an article of commerce that contains very little pork.\" The included pork is typically a piece of salt pork that adds fat to the dish.\n\nCanned baked beans with small pork sausages are still available, as are variants with other added ingredients such as chili.\n\nIn the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore, the term \"baked beans\" usually refers to tinned beans in a tomato sauce. They were originally imported from American companies, first sold in the UK in 1886 in the upmarket Fortnum & Mason store in London as an expensive foreign delicacy.\n\nToday, baked beans are a staple convenience food in the UK, often eaten as part of the modern full English breakfast and particularly on toast (called simply \"beans on toast\"). Baked beans freshly cooked from raw ingredients, much closer to their original unprocessed, unindustrialised form, are offered by a few upmarket brunch establishments. \n\nThe best-selling brand in the UK is Heinz Baked Beans.\n\nIn the United States, Bush's (Bush Brothers and Company), Van Camp's, B&M (Burnham & Morrill Inc.), Allens, Inc., the H. J. Heinz Company, and the Campbell's Soup Company are well-known producers or brands of packaged baked beans. B&M specializes in Boston-style baked beans often sold in beanpot-shaped jars, and canned brown bread, a traditional regional accompaniment to baked beans, whereas Bush and Van Camp produce multiple flavor varieties of canned beans, some styles using cured bacon to flavor the products.\nIn the New England region, baked beans are flavored either with maple syrup (Northern New England), or with molasses (Boston), and are traditionally cooked with salt pork in a beanpot in a brick oven for six to eight hours. In the absence of a brick oven, the beans were cooked in a beanpot nestled in a bed of embers placed near the outer edges of a hearth, about a foot away from the fire. Today, baked beans can be made in a slow cooker or in a modern oven using a traditional beanpot, Dutch oven, or casserole dish.\n\nIn southern states and along the eastern seaboard of the U.S., the beans become tangier usually due to the addition of yellow mustard. For example, the baked beans of Tennessee-based Bush's include mustard in most of their varieties of beans. Ground beef may also become common alongside bacon in the home versions some of these bean styles. They may take on a flavor similar to Cowboy Beans, a home-mixed stew, somewhat similar to a chili but made instead with sweet baked beans.\n\nBaked beans are a staple side dish for various types of barbecue. This is due in part to the ease of handling, as they can be served hot or cold, directly from the can, making them handy for outdoor eating. The tomato-based sweet sauce also complements many types of barbecue. The already-cooked beans may also be baked in a casserole dish topped with slices of raw bacon, which is baked until the bacon is cooked. Additional seasonings are sometimes used, such as additional brown sugar or mustard to make the sauce more tangy.\n\nHeinz baked beans became very successful as an export to the UK, where canned baked beans are now a staple food. In America, the H. J. Heinz Co. continue to sell baked beans, although they are not always as widely distributed as competing American brands. Despite their international fame, there are currently substantial differences between the Heinz baked beans produced for the UK market (descended from the original American recipe) and the nearest currently equivalent American product (Heinz Premium Vegetarian Beans).\n\nThe American product contains brown sugar where the British beans do not, and the U.S. product contains 14 g of sugar per 16 oz tin compared to 7 g for the British version (equating to 140 versus 90 calories). The U.S. beans have a mushier texture and are darker in color than their UK counterpart. This has resulted in a situation where the product is now imported back to the brand's home country. For several years, UK Heinz Baked Beans have been available in the U.S., either in different-sized cans from those sold in the UK or in a 385-gram can (the same can as the 415-gram can in the UK) with an \"export\" label with American English spelling and the word \"baked\" dropped from the title on the label. These are sold in many U.S. specialty stores, attesting to the popularity of baked beans and their appeal to expats. Bush, Van Camp, B&M, and Heinz all produce pork-free baked beans labeled as vegetarian beans, making this American dish available to people who abstain from pork for religious, dietary, or ethical reasons.\n\nTraditional cuisines of many regions claim such recipes as typical specialities, for example:\n\nMany unusual dishes are made with baked beans including the baked bean sandwich. These are slices of bread topped with beans and other additions, such as melted cheese.\n\nIn 2002, the British Dietetic Association allowed manufacturers of canned baked beans to advertise the product as contributing to the recommended daily consumption of five to six vegetables per person. This concession was criticised by heart specialists, who pointed to the high levels of sugar and salt in the product. However, it has been proven that consumption of baked beans does indeed lower total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, even in normo-cholesterolaemic individuals. Some manufacturers produce a \"healthy\" version of the product with reduced levels of sugar and salt.\n\nBaked beans are known on occasion to cause a considerable increase in flatulence following consumption; this is due to the fermentation of polysaccharides (specifically oligosaccharides) by gut flora, specifically \"Methanobrevibacter smithii\". The oligosaccharides pass through the small intestine largely unchanged; when they reach the large intestine, bacteria feast on them, producing copious amounts of flatus. \n\nThis condition is referenced in multiple works of popular culture. Some prominent examples include:\n\n"}

Thinly sliced pepperoni is a popular pizza topping in American-style pizzerias and is used as filling in the West Virginia pepperoni roll.\n\nThe term \"pepperoni\" is a borrowing of \"peperoni\", the plural of \"peperone\", the Italian word for bell pepper. The first use of \"pepperoni\" to refer to a sausage dates to 1919. In Italian, the word \"peperoncino\" (diminutive of \"peperone\") refers to hot and spicy peppers.\n\nPepperoni is a cured dry sausage similar to the spicy salamis of southern Italy, such as \"salsiccia Napoletana piccante,\" a spicy dry sausage from Naples, or the \"soppressata\" from Calabria. The main differences are that pepperoni has a finer grain (akin to \"salami\" of Milan, a spiceless regional variant of salami), is usually softer, and is produced with the use of an artificial casing (instead Italian \"salami\" are produced using natural gut for casing and are made of pure pork). Pepperoni is mass-produced to meet the demand for the sausage. In most of Italy \"pepperoni\" would be considered a type of \"salamino piccante\".\n\nPepperoni is usually made from a mixture of pork and beef. Turkey meat is also commonly used as a substitute, but the use of poultry in pepperoni must be appropriately labeled in the United States. \n\nCuring, with nitrates or nitrites (usually used in modern curing agents, to protect against botulism and other forms of microbiological decay) also contributes to pepperoni's reddish colour, by reacting with heme in the myoglobin of the proteinaceous components of the meat.\n\nAccording to \"Convenience Store Decisions\", Americans annually consume 251.7 million pounds of pepperoni on 36% of all pizzas produced nationally. Pepperoni has a tendency to curl up from the edges in the heat of a pizza oven. Some pepperoni is produced in thicker slices, so that the edges curl intentionally.\n\nPepperoni can also be found accompanying different types of cheeses as a cheap snack food in convenience stores or gas stations.\n\nIn Nova Scotia, deep fried pepperoni served on its own (usually with a honey mustard dipping sauce) is common pub food.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178947", "title": "Salami", "text": "Salami\n\nSalami is a type of cured sausage consisting of fermented and air-dried meat, typically beef or pork. Historically, salami was popular among southern and central European peasants because it can be stored at room temperature for up to 40 days once cut, supplementing a potentially meager or inconsistent supply of fresh meat. Countries and regions across Europe make their own traditional varieties of salami.\n\nThe word \"salami\" in English comes from the plural form of the Italian \"salami\" (singular \"salame\"). It is a singular or plural word in English for cured meats of a European (particularly Italian) style. In Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish, the word is \"salam\"; in Hungarian, it is \"szalámi\", while Polish, Czecho-Slovak, French, German, and Dutch have the same word as English. The name may be derived from the Latin word \"salumen\".\n\nThe word originates from the word \"sale\" (salt) with a termination (\"ame\") that in Italian indicates a collective noun. Thus, it originally meant \"all kinds of salted (meats)\". The Italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles, and the word \"salame\" soon specifically meant only the most popular kind—a salted and spiced meat, ground and extruded into an elongated, thin casing (usually cleaned animal intestine), then left to undergo natural fermentation and drying for days, months, or even years.\n\nThe concept of fermentation—allowing beneficial or benign organisms to grow in food to prevent destructive or toxic ones from growing, with respect to meat, has been around for thousands of years. This is evident in the presence of various types of sausages found globally. Also, environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used, as seen in the Mediterranean and southern Europe, where \"meat products are dried to lower water activity (Aw) values, taking advantage of the long dry and sunny days, while in northern Europe, fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation.\"\n\nIn Europe, the main countries that produce salami are France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Spain, which make \"several of hundred millions kg per year.\"\n\nWorldwide, the many different versions of sausage each have their own cultural and flavor profiles. Additionally, each sausage has its own type of seasonings and amount of salt, making each flavor and texture unique. This wide array of fermented sausages, especially in terms of salami, shows its ubiquitous but exclusive nature. For example, due to immigration to North America, European settlers brought many traditions, including fermented meats such as pepperoni. Similar types of sausages are found in the Middle East, where various meats such as beef, lamb, and mutton are used; or in China, where \"lap cheong\" (translated as \"waxed intestines\") are usually pork.\n\nLikewise, in Eastern Europe, Hungarian salami is quite popular. Hungarian salami is \"intensively smoked, and then its surface is inoculated with mold starters or spontaneous mold growth.\"\n\nA traditional \"salami\", with its typical marbled appearance, is made from beef or pork (sometimes specifically veal). Beef is usual in halal and kosher salami, which never include pork for religious reasons. Makers also use other meats, including venison and poultry (mostly turkey). Goose salami is traditional in parts of Northern Italy. Salami has also been made from horse meat. In the Provence region of France, donkey meat is used for salami, as well, the product being sold in street markets.\nTypical additional ingredients include:\n\nThe maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day, then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing, and hangs it up to cure. Some recipes apply heat to about 40 °C (104 °F) to accelerate fermentation and drying. Higher temperatures (about 60 °C (140 °F)) stop the fermentation when the salami reaches the desired pH, but the product is not fully cooked (75 °C (167 °F) or higher). Makers often treat the casings with an edible mold (\"Penicillium\") culture. The mold imparts flavor, helps the drying process, and helps prevent spoilage during curing.\n\nThough completely uncooked, salami is not raw, but cured. \"Salame cotto\"—typical of the Piedmont region in Italy—is cooked or smoked before or after curing to impart a specific flavor, but not for any benefit of cooking. Before cooking, a \"cotto salame\" is considered raw and not ready to eat.\n\nThree major stages are involved in the production of salami: preparation of raw materials, fermentation, and ripening and drying. Minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various kinds of salami across different countries.\n\nBefore fermentation, raw meat (usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced) is ground (usually coarsely) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt, sugar, spices and yeast, and, if the particular salami variety requires it, lactic acid bacterial starter culture.\n\nThis mixture is then inserted into casings of the desired size. To achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses, fermentation, which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat, has to take place. Direct acidification of meat was found to be inappropriate for salami production, since it causes protein denaturation and an uneven coagulation, thereby causing an undesirable texture in the salami.\n\nFor a more modern controlled fermentation, makers hang the salami in warm, humid conditions for 1-3 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow, then hang it in a cool, humid environment to slowly dry. In a traditional process, the maker skips the fermentation step and immediately hangs the salami in a cool, humid curing environment. Added sugars (usually dextrose) provide a food source for the curing bacteria.\n\nThe bacteria produce lactic acid as a waste product, which lowers the pH and coagulates the proteins, reducing the meat's water-holding capacity. The bacteria-produced acid makes the meat an inhospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria and imparts a tangy flavor that distinguishes salami from machine-dried pork. Salami flavor relies as much on how these bacteria are cultivated as it does on the quality and variety of the other ingredients. Originally, makers introduced wine into the mix, favouring the growth of other beneficial bacteria. Now, they use starter cultures.\n\nThe climate of the curing environment and casing size and style determine the drying and curing process. According to the particular variety of salami, different fermentation methods involving different acids have been explored to create various colours and flavors. Starter cultures such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase-negative cocci (CNC) like specific strains of \"Staphylococcus xylosus\" or \"Micrococcus\" are most commonly used in salami production. More species of LAB and CNC were discovered during recent decades and they were found to have different fermentation temperatures with variable rates of acidification. Despite the fact that these bacteria can help maintain a longer shelf life for meat products and even retard the growth of pathogens, there are a few studies that argue some starter cultures may be related to the production of enterotoxins or biogenic amines that can be harmful to the human body. Therefore, starter cultures have to be carefully selected by producers and properly used in fermentation.\n\nAfter fermentation, the sausage must be dried. This changes the casings from water-permeable to reasonably airtight. A white covering of either mold or flour helps prevent photo-oxidation of the meat and rancidity in the fat.\n\nRipening and drying happens after fermentation. This stage causes the main physical and microbial changes through the large amount of water loss. About half of the water is evaporated and further water loss has to be prevented by packaging. Nonuniform drying processes could cause the formation of a hard shell on the surface of salami. This is similar to other food products such as fruits that undergo dehydration to decrease the risk of diseases or spoilage-causing microbial growth. In modern manufacturing temperature and relative humidity are strictly controlled according to the size of the salami.\n\nNitrates or nitrites may be added to provide additional color and inhibit growth of harmful bacteria from the genus \"Clostridium\". Salt, acidity, nitrate/nitrite levels, and dryness of the fully cured salami combine to make the uncooked meat safe to consume. High quality, fresh ingredients are important to helping prevent deadly microorganisms and toxins from developing.\n\nSalami is homogeneous in appearance and highly ductile. Its quality is dependent on the quality of the raw materials and the level of technology used in its production. The aroma and taste of salami are developed by enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The characteristic fermented meat flavour is believed to be developed by a combination of endogenous enzymatic activities and the lactic acid produced by the starter culture. Lactic acid bacteria develop the tangy flavor of salami through the fermentation of carbohydrates and produces an appealing red color to the meat after fermentation, while coagulase-negative cocci can catabolize amino acids and fatty acids to produce volatile compounds. The flavour itself consists of odour properties, which comes from volatile substances, and taste and tactile properties, which comes from non-volatile substances that are a result of enhancers and synergists.\n\nWhen smoke is applied to salami, it also affects the taste, smell, appearance, and texture. Some of these changes are due to the formation of phenolic compounds, which slow fat oxidation. The pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the salami casing produces carbonyls, which develop the colour of the meat.\n\nMore than 400 volatile compounds have been identified in different types of dry-fermented sausages. For example, the organic compounds identified in Hungarian salami produced the dominant flavours of smokiness, sweetness, pungency, sourness, and cloves; secondary flavours included cooked meat, cheese, popcorn, cooked potato, mushroom, seasoning, phenols, roasting, sulfur, and sweatiness. Some minor flavours included malt, garlic, fruit, pine, grass, citrus, honey, caramel, and vanilla. The overall smoky note is the result of numerous phenols. Whether these odorants are formed in the salami or simply transferred from the raw materials during manufacturing is unknown; systematic studies have yet to compare the odorants present in the raw materials to those in the final product.\n\nSalami will remain stable for long periods of time, as it has a low water activity and contains preservatives, colourings, flavourings, antioxidants and acidifying cultures. Semi-ripened salami will maintain its flavour for long periods of time under retail display conditions, but it will eventually deteriorate due to the development of incipient rancidity. The shelf life of salami is mainly determined by sensory deterioration, which is the result of various oxidation phenomena; pathogenic or spoilage bacteria do not readily proliferate in dry-cured sausage. The main cause of flavour deterioration in dry-cured sausage is rancidity, though the possible formation of other off-flavours, such as mouldy, acid, putrid or pungent traits, may contribute to the decreased quality.\n\nThe use of coriander essential oil in salami has been shown to increase the higher synthetic antioxidant effect of butylated hydroxytoluene, which delays lipid oxidation and the rancid aroma and taste that come with it. Additionally, salami with coriander essential oil shows improvements in the sensory attributes of taste, odor, texture, brightness, and red colour intensity.\n\nSalami varieties include:\n\nMany Old World salami are named after their region or country of origin—such as Arles, Genoa, Hungarian, and Milano salami. Many are flavored with garlic. Some types—including some varieties from Spain (\"salchichón\"), Hungary (pick salami), and Italy (such as Neapolitan varieties that led to American pepperoni) include paprika or chili powder. Varieties also differ by coarseness or fineness of the chopped meat and size and style of the casing.\n\nNaples-type salami is also a popular Southern Italian dry fermented sausage made of coarsely minced pork meat. In Northeast Italy, traditional dry fermented salami sausages made of fresh pork display unique organoleptic sensory profiles characterized by accented acidity, slight sourness, and elastic semi hard consistency. Other popular dry salamis in Italy are mainly made from a combination of pork and small bits of beef, seasoned with garlic; pepperoni is also made of pork and beef, and is usually smoked; and chorizo is highly spiced and smoked.\n\nHungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. \"Szegedi téliszalámi\", a Hungarian winter salami, is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. The Mangalitsa pork breed, with horse large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months.\n\nDry fermented sausage ('salami aeros') is an important product of the Greek meat industry with an annual production of about 10 000 tons. Its manufacture varies depending on the skill and experience of the meat manufacturer rather than a process solely based on scientific and technological means of production. This type of traditional sausage, which undergoes an adventitious fermentation, is of superior quality compared to those inoculated with starters and made in industrial scale. The quality of this type of traditional salami is often more expensive due to its high quality.\n\nIn Germany, Westphalian salami is made with fast technology from pork meat, pepper, garlic, and sometimes mustard seeds, and is smoked, firm, sliceable product with a distinct fermentation/sour flavor. The sausages are stuffed into large-diameter casings and ripened by lowering the temperature from 24 °C to 12–14 °C until a water loss of 25% is obtained.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the most popular Dutch products are finely chopped salami, \"Cervelat\", \"Snijworst\" (with high fat content and rind added), \"Boerenmetworst\" (which is coarsely chopped), and chorizo (which is less spicy than the Spanish product). In Russia, typical products are Moscow-type and Russian-type salamis made from pork and beef meat. A particular feature of Moscow-type salami is the large size of fat particles (7–8mm) that give the sausage a rough cover.\n\nThere are many aspects of salami that can be considered both negative and positive to human health. Salami has been found to be a possible allergen to some people due to the use of penicillium species mold starter during the drying and curing portion of processing to add flavor and stop growth of undesirable molds. These molds occur predominantly in the skin of salami.\n\nFermented pork back fat that is used to make salami has very high saturated fatty acid and cholesterol content, which can increase the risk of heart disease and pancreatitis. However, it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami. Olive oil consists of a much larger amount of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which allows this substitution to create a healthier product. Salami is considered slightly acidic due to lactic acid that is present. In salami where extra virgin olive oil was substituted for the pork back fat, it has shown to have a lower pH of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55 making the salami more acidic. These lower pH levels are healthier for humans as higher populations of lactic acid bacteria inhibit the spread of spoilage microorganisms.\n\nThere have also been cases that have showcased some of the possible health dangers of salami. An outbreak of \"\" infection of a husband and wife was traced back to the consumption of dry fermented salami made with pork meat after the couple was hospitalized for bloody diarrhea. There was also an outbreak of \"E. coli\" O157 in 1994 with 17 cases all occurring from the consumption of pre-sliced salami that was processed by one company. A research investigation of the factory where the salami was processed found that all processing techniques and production methods complied with all regulations and there was no evidence of contamination after processing.\n\nPreservation of any meat products is important. Some fungi can create undesirable color and flavor to the contaminated meat and produce toxins. There are also fungi which are not harmful to humans such as those that are formed on the surface of dried salami which are an indication of maturation after ripening. Thus, producers have to eliminate fungi that have potential risks to human health. As natural preservatives are becoming more desirable food additives than artificial preservatives in food industries, some studies about salami have been focusing on the utilization of essential oils such as oregano and clove oil as preservatives that can be applied to salami production due to their anti-fungal activities. Several types of oils including rosemary, clove, oregano and sage oils were found to have different levels of inhibition effect to various types of fungi that could possibly grow on salami. Since several of these oils contain volatile compounds whose amount can affect the flavor of the food, researchers often perform a sensory test to find the amount of the oil that can best serve as an anti-fungal preservative but have the least effect on the flavor or appearance of the salami.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178952", "title": "Kimchi", "text": "Kimchi\n\nKimchi (; , ), a staple in Korean cuisine, is a famous traditional side dish made from salted and fermented vegetables, most commonly napa cabbage and Korean radishes, with a variety of seasonings, including \"gochugaru\" (chili powder), scallions, garlic, ginger, and \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood). There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients. In the past, kimchi was traditionally stored underground in jars to keep cool during warm months, and remain unfrozen throughout the winter months, during which time it was a vital source of vegetables. With the rise of technology, kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used to store kimchi.\n\nThe term \"ji\" (), which has its origins in archaic Korean \"dihi\" (), has been used to refer to kimchi since ancient times. The sound change can be roughly described as:\nThe Middle Korean form \"dihi\" is found in several books from \"Joseon\" (1392–1897). In Modern Korean, the word remains as the suffix \"-ji\" in the standard language (as in \"jjanji\", \"seokbak-ji\"), and as the suffix \"-ji\" as well as the noun \"ji\" in Gyeongsang and Jeolla dialects. The unpalatalized form \"di\" is preserved in P'yŏngan dialect.\n\n\"Kimchi\" () is the accepted word in both North and South Korean standard languages. Earlier forms of the word include \"timchɑi\" (), a Middle Korean transcription of the Sino-Korean word (literally \"submerged vegetable\"). \"Timchɑi\" appears in \"Sohak Eonhae\", the 16th century Korean rendition of the Chinese book, \"Xiaoxue\" (in Korean, \"Sohak\"). Sound changes from Middle Korean to Modern Korean regarding the word can be described as:\n\nThe aspirated first consonant of \"timchɑi\" became unaspirated in \"dimchɑi\", then underwent palatalization in \"jimchɑi\". The word then became \"jimchui\" with the loss of the vowel \"ɑ\" () in Korean language, then \"Kimchi\", with the depalatalized word-initial consonant. In Modern Korean, the hanja characters are pronounced \"chimchae\" (), and are not used to refer to kimchi, or anything else. The word \"Kimchi\" is not considered as a Sino-Korean word. Older forms of the word are retained in many regional dialects: \"jimchae\" (Jeolla, Hamgyŏng dialects), \"jimchi\" (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Hamgyŏng, Jeolla dialects), and \"dimchi\" (P'yŏngan dialect).\n\nThe English word \"kimchi\" perhaps originated from \"kimch'i\", the McCune–Reischauer transcription of the Korean word \"Kimchi\" ().\n\nThe origin of kimchi dates back at least to the early period of the Three Kingdoms (37 BC‒7 AD). Fermented foods were widely available, as the \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", a Chinese historical text published in 289 AD, mentions that \"The \"Goguryeo\" people [referring to the Korean people] are skilled in making fermented foods such as wine, soybean paste, and salted and fermented fish\" in the section named \"Dongyi\" in the \"Book of Wei\". \"Samguk Sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, also mentions the pickle jar used to ferment vegetables, which indicates that fermented vegetables were commonly eaten during this time. During the Silla dynasty (57 BC – AD 935), kimchi became prevalent as Buddhism caught on throughout the nation and fostered a vegetarian lifestyle. \n\nThe pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods. In Korea, kimchi was made during the winter by fermenting vegetables, and burying it in the ground in traditional brown ceramic pots called \"onggi\". This labor further allowed a bonding among women within the family. A poem on Korean radish written by Yi Gyubo, a 13th century literatus, shows that radish kimchi was a commonplace in Goryeo (918–1392).\n\nKimchi has been a staple in Korean culture, but historical versions were not a spicy dish. Early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a standard ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century due to it being a New World crop. Chili peppers, originally native to the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in \"Jibong yuseol\", an encyclopedia published in 1614. \"Sallim gyeongje\", a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread. The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.\n\nA 1766 book, \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\", reports kimchi varieties made with a myriad of ingredients, including \"chonggak-kimchi\" (kimchi made with chonggak raddish), \"oi-sobagi\" (with cucumber), \"seokbak-ji\" (with \"jogi-jeot\"), and \"dongchimi\". However, napa cabbage was only introduced to Korea at the end of 19th century, and whole-cabbage kimchi similar to its current form is described in \"Siuijeonseo\", a cookbook published around that time.\n\nKimchi is a national dish of both North and South Korea. During South Korea's involvement in the Vietnam War its government requested American help to ensure that South Korean troops, reportedly \"desperate\" for the food, could obtain it in the field; South Korean president Park Chung-hee told U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson that kimchi was \"vitally important to the morale of Korean troops\". It was also sent to space on board Soyuz TMA-12 with South-Korean astronaut Yi So-yeon after a multimillion-dollar research effort to kill the bacteria and lessen the odor without affecting taste. On 22 November 2017 a Google Doodle was used to \"Celebrate Kimchi\".\n\nKimchi varieties are determined by the main vegetable ingredients and the mix of seasoning used to flavor the kimchi.\n\nThere are many different types of Kimchi dishes, and the most famous meal in this category is the cabbage Kimchi. This meal is pungent and largely seasoned, and illustrates the family pride source as well as a taste of a good home. Cabbages (napa cabbages, bomdong, headed cabbages) and radishes (Korean radishes, ponytail radishes, gegeol radishes, yeolmu radishes) are the most commonly used kimchi vegetables. Other kimchi vegetables include: aster, balloon flower roots, burdock roots, celery, chamnamul, cilantro, cress, crown daisy greens, cucumber, eggplant, garlic chives, garlic scapes, ginger, Korean angelica-tree shoots, Korean parsley, Korean wild chive, lotus roots, mustard greens, onions, perilla leaves, potatoes, pumpkins, radish greens, rapeseed leaves, scallions, soybean sprouts, spinach, sugar beets, sweet potato vines, and tomatoes..\n\nBrining salt (with a larger grain size compared to kitchen salt) is used mainly for initial salting of kimchi vegetables. Being minimally processed, it serves to help develop flavours in fermented foods.\n\nCommonly used seasonings include \"gochugaru\" (chili powder), scallions, garlic, ginger, and \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood) \"Jeotgal\" can be replaced with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the Korean peninsula. If used, milder \"saeu-jeot\" (salted shrimp) or \"jogi-jeot\" (salted croaker) is preferred and the amount of \"jeotgal\" is also reduced in Northern and Central regions. In Southern Korea, on the other hand, generous amount of stronger \"myeolchi-jeot\" (salted anchovies) and \"galchi-jeot\" (salted hairtail) is commonly used. Raw seafood or \"daegu-agami-jeot\" (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.\n\nThe microorganisms present in kimchi include \"Bacillus mycoides\", \"B. pseudomycoides\", \"B. subtilis\", \"Lactobacillus brevis\", \"Lb. curvatus\", \"Lb. kimchii\", \"Lb. parabrevis\", \"Lb. pentosus\", \"Lb. plantarum\", \"Lb. sakei\", \"Lb. spicheri\", \"Lactococcus carnosum\", \"Lc. gelidum\", \"Lc. lactis\", \"Leuconostoc carnosum\", \"Ln. citreum\", \"Ln. gasicomitatum\", \"Ln. gelidum\", \"Ln. holzapfelii\", \"Ln. inhae\", \"Ln. kimchii\", \"Ln. lactis\", \"Ln. mesenteroides\", \"Serratia marcescens\", \"Weissella cibaria\", \"W. confusa\", \"W. kandleri\", \"W. kimchii\". \"W. koreensis\", and \"W. soli\".\n\nKimchi is one of the most important dishes in Korean cuisine. \"Kimchi\" is Korean terminology for fermented vegetables, and encompasses salt and seasoned vegetables. Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish consisting of pickled vegetables, which is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish. Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally. Variations are not limited, as Koreans \"can make kimchi out of anything edible; a concept which extends toward infinite possibilities...\" Variations of kimchi continue to grow, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season. Conventionally, the secret of kimchi preparation was passed down by mothers to their daughters in a bid to make them suitable wives to their husbands. However, with the current technological advancement and increase in social media use, many individuals worldwide can now access the recipe for kimchi preparation. It is highly nutritious and offers deeply-flavored and spicy meals favorable to many classes of people, and illustrates the Korean culture as well.\n\nKimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons. Korea's northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference. There are over 180 recognized varieties of kimchi. The most common kimchi variations are\nKimchi from the northern parts of Korea tends to have less salt and red chili and usually does not include brined seafood for seasoning. Northern kimchi often has a watery consistency. Kimchi made in the southern parts of Korea, such as Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, uses salt, chili peppers and \"myeolchijeot\" (, brined anchovy allowed to ferment) or \"saeujeot\" (, brined shrimp allowed to ferment), \"myeolchiaekjeot\" (), \"kkanariaekjeot\" (), liquid anchovy jeot, similar to fish sauce used in Southeast Asia, but thicker.\n\n\"Saeujeot\" () or \"myeolchijeot\" is not added to the kimchi spice-seasoning mixture, but is simmered first to reduce odors, eliminate tannic flavor and fats, and then is mixed with a thickener made of rice or wheat starch (). This technique has been falling into disuse in the past 40 years.\n\nWhite kimchi are neither red in color nor spicy. It includes white napa cabbage kimchi and other varieties such as white radish kimchi (\"dongchimi\"). Watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in \"dongchimi\" brine (\"dongchimi-guksu\").\n\n\nThis regional classification dates back to 1960s and contains plenty of historical facts, but the current kimchi-making trends in Korea are generally different from those mentioned below.\n\n\nDifferent types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration. Although the advent of modern refrigeration — including kimchi refrigerators specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation — has made this seasonality unnecessary, Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.\n\nAfter a long period of consuming \"gimjang kimchi\" () during the winter, fresh potherbs and vegetables were used to make kimchi. These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.\n\n\nYeolmu radishes and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, \"yeolmu-kimchi\" () which is eaten in several bites. Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.\n\n\"Baechu kimchi\" is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called \"sok\" (literally \"inside\"), between layers of salted leaves of uncut, whole Napa cabbage. The ingredients of \"sok\" () can vary, depending on the different regions and weather conditions. Generally, \"baechu kimchi\" used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large amount of \"myeolchijeot\" or \"saeujeot\" had been used.\n\n\"Gogumasoon Kimchi\" is made from sweet potato stems.\n\nTraditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter. In preparation for the long winter months, many types of kimjang kimchi () were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots. Today, many city residents use modern kimchi refrigerators offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi. November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each other's homes to help with winter kimchi preparations. \"Baechu kimchi\" is made with salted baechu filled with thin strips of radish, parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, manna lichen (), garlic, and ginger.\n\nA 2004 book about vegetable preservation said that the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: baechu kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then kaktugi, then dongchimi and then chonggak kimchi. The book said that baechu kimchi comprises more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprises about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.\n\nA 2003 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" said that South Koreans consume 18kg (40lbs) of kimchi per person annually. A 2015 book cited a 2011 source that said that adult Koreans eat from to of kimchi a day.\n\nSome Koreans believe that kimchi helps them cope with their fast-paced lives. Kimchi is made of various vegetables and contains a high concentration of dietary fiber, while being low in calories. One serving also provides over 50% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin C and carotene. Most types of kimchi contain onions, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers, all of which are salutary. The vegetables used in kimchi also contribute to its overall nutritional value. Kimchi is rich in vitamin A, thiamine (B), riboflavin (B), calcium, and iron, and contains lactic acid bacteria, among those the typical species \"Lactobacillus kimchii\".\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak in Asia, many people believed that kimchi could protect against infection. While there was no scientific evidence to support this belief, kimchi sales rose by 40%.\n\nHowever, kimchi may also contribute to stomach cancer, which is the most common form of cancer in South Korea. In 2011, three Korean scientists reported that, \"Kimchi, which is allegedly believed to have anti-carcinogenic properties, accounts for approximately 20% of sodium intake [in South Korea]. Case-control studies on the intake level of kimchi and gastric cancer risk generally showed an increased risk among subjects with high or frequent intakes of kimchi.\"\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\nKimchi is known to be a traditional side dish as it is almost always served along with other side dishes in most Korean family households and restaurants. Kimchi can be eaten alone or with white rice, but it is also included in recipes of other traditional dishes, including porridges, soups, and rice cakes. Kimchi is also the basis for many derivative dishes such as kimchi stew (), kimchi pancake (), kimchi soup (), and kimchi fried rice (). \nArmy base stew () is a popular dish made with spam, sausage, and kimchi. It originated after the Korean war with ingredients that would be scrounged from the army.\n\nSouth Korea consumes 1.85 million metric tons of kimchi annually, or nearly 80 pounds a person. It imports a significant fraction of that, mostly from China, and runs a $47.3 million kimchi trade deficit.\n\nIn 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product (\"kimuchi\") was different from kimchi (in particular, Japanese kimuchi was not fermented so it was salted like sweet cabbage). Korea lobbied for an international standard from the Codex Alimentarius, an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as \"a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature\", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives.\n\nSouth Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.\n\nDue to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly. Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis. Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which \"The New York Times\" compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free ketchup. In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the Kimjang season.\n\nSince 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned Korean kimchi exports to China through government regulations. Ignoring the standards of Kimchi outlined by the Codex Alimentarius, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called pao cai. However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations. Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero, the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi are exhibition events held in China.\n\nKimchi-related items have been inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by both South and North Korea. This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two different countries, the other one being the folk song \"Arirang\" which was also submitted by both the Koreas.\n\nKimjang, the tradition of making and sharing of kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as \"Kimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea\". The practice of Kimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation. Kimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.\n\nNorth Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015 as \"Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\". North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and red than South Korean kimchi.\n\nA 2014 article in \"Tuổi Trẻ\" said that around 40 Vietnamese brides who had already married or who were going to marry Korean men spent two hours in a class in 2014 to make kimchi and kimbap at the Kim & Kim Company’s factory in the Tân Bình Industrial Zone of Ho Chi Minh City. The event was arranged by the Kim & Kim Company and the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City. The class is a free class that has been taught to 30 to 35 women once a month. Han Ji-sook, the director of the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City, said, \"Kimchi is important for Korean people, so anyone who visits the country will experience kimchi or kimchi-making. Especially for the wives of Korean men, it's important to know how to make kimchi.\" Kim Tae-kon, director of the Kim & Kim Company, said, \"All of these Vietnamese women who are going to live in Korea must eat kimchi every day, three meals a day. I'm pleased to give them the chance to learn how to make kimchi.\"\n\nA 2017 article in \"The New York Times\" said that anti-Korean sentiment in China has risen after South Korea's acceptance of the deployment of THAAD in South Korea, Government-run Chinese news media has encouraged the boycott of South Korean goods, and Chinese nationalists have vowed to not eat kimchi.\n\n\n\n"}

The dough is stretched with the help of vegetable oil to make very thin strips and then air dried. When served warm in soup, usually in winter, they are called \"nyumen\" (\"煮麺)\" in Japanese.\n\nSōmen are usually served cold with a light flavored dipping sauce or \"tsuyu\". The tsuyu is usually a \"katsuobushi\"-based sauce that can be flavored with Japanese bunching onion, ginger, or \"myoga\". In the summer, sōmen chilled with ice is a popular meal to help stay cool.\n\nSōmen served in hot soup is usually called \"nyūmen\" and eaten in the winter, much as soba or udon are.\n\nSome restaurants offer \"nagashi-sōmen\" (流しそうめん flowing noodles) in the summer. The noodles are placed in a long flume of bamboo across the length of the restaurant. The flume carries clear, ice-cold water. As the sōmen pass by, diners pluck them out with their chopsticks and dip them in tsuyu. Catching the noodles requires a fair amount of dexterity, but the noodles that are not caught by the time they get to the end usually are not eaten, so diners are pressured to catch as much as they can. A few luxury establishments put their sōmen in real streams so that diners can enjoy their meal in a beautiful garden setting. Machines have been designed to simulate this experience at home.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, \"somyeon\" is used in hot and cold noodles soups such as \"janchi-guksu\" (banquet noodles) and \"kong-guksu\" (noodles in cold soybean soup), as well as soupless noodle dishes such as \"bibim-guksu\" (mixed noodles). It is often served with spicy \"anju\" (food that accompanies alcoholic drink) such as \"golbaengi-muchim\" (moon snail salad).\n\n"}
{"id": "180075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180075", "title": "Takoyaki", "text": "Takoyaki\n\n\"Yaki\" is derived from which is one of the cooking methods in Japanese cuisine, meaning \"to fry or grill\", and can be found in the names of other Japanese cuisine items such as \"okonomiyaki\" and \"ikayaki\" (other famous Osakan dishes).\n\nTakoyaki was first popularized in Osaka, where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. Takoyaki was inspired by akashiyaki, a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture made of an egg-rich batter and octopus. Takoyaki was initially popular in the Kansai region, and later spread to the Kantō region and other areas of Japan. Takoyaki is associated with \"yatai\" street food stalls, and there are many well-established takoyaki specialty restaurants, particularly in the Kansai region. Takoyaki is now sold at commercial outlets, such as supermarkets and 24-hour convenience stores.\n\nIt is also very popular in Taiwanese cuisine due to the historical influence of Japanese culture.\n\nFurthermore, the earliest appeared in Osaka's takoyaki store which called Aizuya. It has a history of more than 80 years, is the ancestor of takoyaki. The founder is Tomekichi Endo. For the first appeared of takoyaki that was not made by octopus, and some also added beef and konjac. Until later, customers dissatisfied of this takoyaki. Mr. Endo changed to use the octopus as a material and added flavor to the batter. Octopus being the raw material of takoyaki is popular with customers since they loves the octopus in the meatballs with the brown sauce. Finally, this food named ‘’Octopus balls’’, which promoted quickly to whole Japan. \n\nA or—much more rarely— is typically a griddle made of cast iron with half-spherical molds. The heavy iron evenly heats the takoyaki, which are turned with a pick during the cooking process to pull the uncooked batter to the base of the rounded cavity. Commercial gas-fueled takoyaki cookers are used at Japanese festivals or by street vendors. For home use, electric versions resemble a hotplate; stovetop versions are also available.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "180786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180786", "title": "Hermeticism", "text": "Hermeticism\n\nHermeticism, also called Hermetism, is a religious, philosophical, and esoteric tradition based primarily upon writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (\"thrice-greatest Hermes\"). These writings have greatly influenced the Western esoteric tradition and were considered to be of great importance during both the Renaissance and the Reformation. The tradition traces its origin to a \"prisca theologia\", a doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true theology that is present in all religions and that was given by God to man in antiquity.\n\nMany writers, including Lactantius, Cyprian of Carthage, Augustine of Hippo, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella, Sir Thomas Browne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity.\n\nMuch of the importance of Hermeticism arises from its connection with the development of science during the time from 1300 to 1600 AD. The prominence that it gave to the idea of influencing or controlling nature led many scientists to look to magic and its allied arts (e.g., alchemy, astrology) which, it was thought, could put nature to the test by means of experiments. Consequently, it was the practical aspects of Hermetic writings that attracted the attention of scientists. Isaac Newton placed great faith in the concept of an unadulterated, pure, ancient doctrine, which he studied vigorously to aid his understanding of the physical world.\n\nThe term \"Hermetic\" is from the medieval Latin \"hermeticus\", which is derived from the name of the Greek god Hermes. In English, it has been attested since the 17th century, as in \"Hermetic writers\" (e.g., Robert Fludd).\n\nThe word \"Hermetic\" was used by John Everard in his English translation of \"The Pymander of Hermes\", published in 1650.\n\nMary Anne Atwood mentioned the use of the word \"Hermetic\" by Dufresnoy in 1386.\n\nThe synonymous term \"Hermetical\" is also attested in the 17th century. Sir Thomas Browne in his \"Religio Medici\" of 1643 wrote: \"Now besides these particular and divided Spirits, there may be (for ought I know) a universal and common Spirit to the whole world. It was the opinion of Plato, and is yet of the Hermeticall Philosophers.\" (R. M. Part 1:2)\n\nHermes Trimegistus supposedly invented the process of making a glass tube airtight (a process in alchemy) using a secret seal. Hence, the term \"completely sealed\" is implied in \"hermetically sealed\" and the term \"hermetic\" is also equivalent to \"occult\" or hidden.\n\nIn Late Antiquity, Hermetism emerged in parallel with early Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, the Chaldaean Oracles, and late Orphic and Pythagorean literature. These doctrines were \"characterized by a resistance to the dominance of either pure rationality or doctrinal faith.\"\n\nThe books now known as the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" were part of a renaissance of syncretistic and intellectualized pagan thought that took place from the 3rd to the 7th century AD. These post-Christian Greek texts dwell upon the oneness and goodness of God, urge purification of the soul, and defend religious practices such as the veneration of images. Their predominant literary form is the dialogue: Hermes Trismegistus instructs a perplexed disciple upon various teachings of the hidden wisdom.\n\nPlutarch's mention of Hermes Trismegistus dates back to the 1st century AD, and Tertullian, Iamblichus, and Porphyry were all familiar with Hermetic writings.\n\nAfter centuries of falling out of favor, Hermeticism was reintroduced to the West when, in 1460, a man named Leonardo de Candia Pistoia brought the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" to Pistoia. He was one of many agents sent out by Pistoia's ruler, Cosimo de' Medici, to scour European monasteries for lost ancient writings.\n\nIn 1614, Isaac Casaubon, a Swiss philologist, analyzed the Greek Hermetic texts for linguistic style. He concluded that the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were not the work of an ancient Egyptian priest but in fact dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\n\nEven in light of Casaubon's linguistic discovery (and typical of many adherents of Hermetic philosophy in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries), Thomas Browne in his \"Religio Medici\" (1643) confidently stated: \"The severe schools shall never laugh me out of the philosophy of Hermes, that this visible world is but a portrait of the invisible.\" (R. M. Part 1:12)\n\nIn 1678, however, flaws in Casaubon's dating were discerned by Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon's allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the Corpus Hermeticum. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon's failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a terminus a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of alchemy clothed in philosophical metaphor.\n\nIn the 19th century, Walter Scott placed the date of the Hermetic texts shortly after 200 AD, but W. Flinders Petrie placed their origin between 200 and 500 BC.\n\nIn 1945, Hermetic texts were found near the Egyptian town Nag Hammadi. One of these texts had the form of a conversation between Hermes and Asclepius. A second text (titled \"On the Ogdoad and Ennead\") told of the Hermetic mystery schools. It was written in the Coptic language, the latest and final form in which the Egyptian language was written.\n\nAccording to Geza Vermes, Hermeticism was a Hellenistic mysticism contemporaneous with the Fourth Gospel, and Hermes Tresmegistos was \"the Hellenized reincarnation of the Egyptian deity Thoth, the source of wisdom, who was believed to deify man through knowledge (\"gnosis\").\"\n\nGilles Quispel says \"It is now completely certain that there existed before and after the beginning of the Christian era in Alexandria a secret society, akin to a Masonic lodge. The members of this group called themselves 'brethren,' were initiated through a baptism of the Spirit, greeted each other with a sacred kiss, celebrated a sacred meal and read the Hermetic writings as edifying treatises for their spiritual progress.\" On the other hand, Christian Bull argues that \"there is no reason to identify [Alexandria] as the birthplace of a 'Hermetic lodge' as several scholars have done. There is neither internal nor external evidence for such an Alexandrian 'lodge', a designation that is alien to the ancient world and carries Masonic connotations.\"\n\nIn Hermeticism, the ultimate reality is referred to variously as God, the All, or the One. God in the Hermetica is unitary and transcendent: he is one and exists apart from the material cosmos. Hermetism is therefore profoundly monotheistic although in a deistic and unitarian understanding of the term. \"For it is a ridiculous thing to confess the World to be one, one Sun, one Moon, one Divinity, and yet to have, I know not how many gods.\"\n\nIts philosophy teaches that there is a transcendent God, or Absolute, in which we and the entire universe participate. It also subscribes to the idea that other beings, such as aeons, angels and elementals, exist within the universe.\n\nHermeticists believe in a \"prisca theologia\", the doctrine that a single, true theology exists, that it exists in all religions, and that it was given by God to man in antiquity. In order to demonstrate the truth of the \"prisca theologia\" doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of Moses or the third in a line of men named Hermes—Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest-king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus.\n\nThe actual text of that maxim, as translated by Dennis W. Hauck from \"The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus\", is: \"That which is Below corresponds to that which is Above, and that which is Above corresponds to that which is Below, to accomplish the miracle of the One Thing.\" Thus, whatever happens on any level of reality (physical, emotional, or mental) also happens on every other level.\n\nThis principle, however, is more often used in the sense of the microcosm and the macrocosm. The microcosm is oneself, and the macrocosm is the universe. The macrocosm is as the microcosm and vice versa; within each lies the other, and through understanding one (usually the microcosm) a person may understand the other.\n\nAlchemy (the operation of the Sun): Alchemy is not merely the changing of lead into gold. It is an investigation into the spiritual constitution, or life, of matter and material existence through an application of the mysteries of birth, death, and resurrection. The various stages of chemical distillation and fermentation, among other processes, are aspects of these mysteries that, when applied, quicken nature's processes in order to bring a natural body to perfection. This perfection is the accomplishment of the \"magnum opus\" (Latin for \"Great Work\").\n\nAstrology (the operation of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered this part of the wisdom of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, it is likely that the movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained when we know what these influences are and how to deal with them.\n\nTheurgy (the operation of the gods): There are two different types of magic, according to Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's \"Apology\", completely opposite of each other. The first is Goëtia (Greek: γοητεια), black magic reliant upon an alliance with evil spirits (i.e., demons). The second is Theurgy, divine magic reliant upon an alliance with divine spirits (i.e., angels, archangels, gods).\n\n\"Theurgy\" translates to \"The Science or Art of Divine Works\" and is the practical aspect of the Hermetic art of alchemy. Furthermore, alchemy is seen as the \"key\" to theurgy, the ultimate goal of which is to become united with higher counterparts, leading to the attainment of Divine Consciousness.\n\nReincarnation is mentioned in Hermetic texts. Hermes Trismegistus asked:\n\nO son, how many bodies have we to pass through, how many bands of demons, through how many series of repetitions and cycles of the stars, before we hasten to the One alone?\n\nHermes explains in Book 9 of the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" that nous (reason and knowledge) brings forth either good or evil, depending upon whether one receives one's perceptions from God or from demons. God brings forth good, but demons bring forth evil. Among the evils brought forth by demons are: \"adultery, murder, violence to one's father, sacrilege, ungodliness, strangling, suicide from a cliff and all such other demonic actions\".\n\nThis provides evidence that Hermeticism includes a sense of morality. However, the word \"good\" is used very strictly. It is restricted to references to God. It is only God (in the sense of the nous, not in the sense of the All) who is completely free of evil. Men are prevented from being good because man, having a body, is consumed by his physical nature, and is ignorant of the Supreme Good.\n\nA focus upon the material life is said to be the only thing that offends God:\n\nOne must create, one must do something positive in one's life, because God is a generative power. Not creating anything leaves a person \"sterile\" (i.e., unable to accomplish anything).\n\nA creation story is told by God to Hermes in the first book of the \"Corpus Hermeticum\". It begins when God, by an act of will, creates the primary matter that is to constitute the cosmos. From primary matter God separates the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Then God orders the elements into the seven heavens (often held to be the spheres of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon, which travel in circles and govern destiny).\n\n\"The Word\" then leaps forth from the materializing four elements, which were unintelligent. Nous then makes the seven heavens spin, and from them spring forth creatures without speech. Earth is then separated from water, and animals (other than man) are brought forth.\n\nThe God then created androgynous man, in God's own image, and handed over his creation.\n\nMan carefully observed the creation of nous and received from God man's authority over all creation. Man then rose up above the spheres' paths in order to better view creation. He then showed the form of the All to Nature. Nature fell in love with the All, and man, seeing his reflection in water, fell in love with Nature and wished to dwell in it. Immediately, man became one with Nature and became a slave to its limitations, such as sex and sleep. In this way, man became speechless (having lost \"the Word\") and he became \"double\", being mortal in body yet immortal in spirit, and having authority over all creation yet subject to destiny.\n\nAn alternative account of the fall of man, preserved in the \"Discourses of Isis to Horus\", is as follows:\n\nGod, having created the universe, then created the divisions, the worlds, and various gods and goddesses, whom he appointed to certain parts of the universe. He then took a mysterious transparent substance, out of which he created human souls. He appointed the souls to the astral region, which is just above the physical region.\n\nHe then assigned the souls to create life on Earth. He handed over some of his creative substance to the souls and commanded them to contribute to his creation. The souls then used the substance to create the various animals and forms of physical life. Soon after, however, the souls began to overstep their boundaries; they succumbed to pride and desired to be equal to the highest gods.\n\nGod was displeased and called upon Hermes to create physical bodies that would imprison the souls as a punishment for them. Hermes created human bodies on earth, and God then told the souls of their punishment. God decreed that suffering would await them in the physical world, but he promised them that, if their actions on Earth were worthy of their divine origin, their condition would improve and they would eventually return to the heavenly world. If it did not improve, he would condemn them to repeated reincarnation upon Earth.\n\nTobias Churton, Professor of Western Esotericism at the University of Exeter, states, \"The Hermetic tradition was both moderate and flexible, offering a tolerant philosophical religion, a religion of the (omnipresent) mind, a purified perception of God, the cosmos, and the self, and much positive encouragement for the spiritual seeker, all of which the student could take anywhere.\" Lutheran Bishop James Heiser recently evaluated the writings of Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola as an attempted \"Hermetic Reformation\".\n\nHermeticists generally attribute 42 books to Hermes Trismegistus, although many more have been attributed to him. Most of them, however, are said to have been lost when the Great Library of Alexandria was destroyed.\n\nThere are three major texts that contain Hermetic doctrines:\n\nOther important original Hermetic texts include the Discourses of Isis to Horus, which consists of a long dialogue between Isis and Horus on the fall of man and other matters; the Definitions of Hermes to Asclepius; and many fragments, which are chiefly preserved in the anthology of Stobaeus.\n\nThere are additional works that, while not as historically significant as the works listed above, have an important place in neo-Hermeticism:\n\n\"A Suggestive Inquiry\" was used for the study of Hermeticism and resulted in several works being published by members of the Golden Dawn:\n\nWhen Hermeticism was no longer endorsed by the Christian church, it was driven underground, and several Hermetic societies were formed. The western esoteric tradition is now steeped in Hermeticism. The work of such writers as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who attempted to reconcile Jewish kabbalah and Christian mysticism, brought Hermeticism into a context more easily understood by Europeans during the time of the Renaissance.\n\nA few primarily Hermetic occult orders were founded in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance.\n\nHermetic magic underwent a 19th-century revival in Western Europe, where it was practiced by groups such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Aurum Solis, and Ragon. It was also practiced by individual persons, such as Eliphas Lévi, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, Frederick Hockley, and Kenneth M. Mackenzie.\n\nMany Hermetic, or Hermetically influenced, groups exist today. Most of them are derived from Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, or the Golden Dawn.\n\nRosicrucianism is a movement which incorporates the Hermetic philosophy. It dates back to the 17th century. The sources dating the existence of the Rosicrucians to the 17th century are three German pamphlets: the \"Fama\", the \"Confessio Fraternitatis\", and \"The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz\".\nSome scholars believe these to be hoaxes and say that later Rosicrucian organizations are the first actual appearance of a Rosicrucian society. This argument is hard to sustain given that original copies are in existence, including a \"Fama Fraternitatis\" at the University of Illinois and another in the New York Public Library. \n\nThe Rosicrucian Order consists of a secret inner body and a public outer body that is under the direction of the inner body. It has a graded system in which members move up in rank and gain access to more knowledge. There is no fee for advancement. Once a member has been deemed able to understand the teaching, he moves on to the next higher grade.\n\nThe \"Fama Fraternitatis\" states that the Brothers of the Fraternity are to profess no other thing than \"to cure the sick, and that gratis\".\n\nThe Rosicrucian spiritual path incorporates philosophy, kabbalah, and divine magic.\n\nThe Order is symbolized by the rose (the soul) and the cross (the body). The unfolding rose represents the human soul acquiring greater consciousness while living in a body on the material plane.\n\nUnlike the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was open to both sexes and treated them as equals. The Order was a specifically Hermetic society that taught alchemy, kabbalah, and the magic of Hermes, along with the principles of occult science.\n\nThe Golden Dawn maintained the tightest of secrecy, which was enforced by severe penalties for those who disclosed its secrets. Overall, the general public was left oblivious of the actions, and even of the existence, of the Order, so few if any secrets were disclosed.\n\nIts secrecy was broken first by Aleister Crowley in 1905 and later by Israel Regardie in 1937. Regardie gave a detailed account of the Order's teachings to the general public.\n\nRegardie had once claimed that there were many occult orders which had learned whatever they knew of magic from what had been leaked from the Golden Dawn by those whom Regardie deemed \"renegade members\".\n\nThe Stella Matutina was a successor society of the Golden Dawn.\n\nHermeticism remains influential within esoteric Christianity, especially in Martinism. Influential 20th century and early 21st century writers in the field include Valentin Tomberg and Sergei O. Prokofieff. The Kybalion somewhat explicitly owed itself to Christianity, and the Meditations on the Tarot was one important book illustrating the theory and practice of Christian Hermeticism.\n\nHermeticism remains influential within Neopaganism, especially in Hellenism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "181327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181327", "title": "Danish pastry", "text": "Danish pastry\n\nA Danish pastry or just a Danish (especially in American English) is a multilayered, laminated sweet pastry in the viennoiserie tradition. The concept was brought to Denmark by Austrian bakers and has since developed into a Danish specialty. Like other viennoiserie pastries, such as croissants, it is a variant of puff pastry made of laminated yeast-leavened dough that creates a layered texture.\n\nDanish pastries were brought with immigrants to the United States, and are now popular around the world.\n\nDanish pastry is made of yeast-leavened dough of wheat flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and large amounts of butter or margarine.\n\nA yeast dough is rolled out thinly, covered with thin slices of butter between the layers of dough, and then the dough is folded and rolled several times, creating 27 layers. If necessary, the dough is chilled between foldings to ease handling. The process of rolling, buttering, folding, and chilling is repeated multiple times to create a multilayered dough that becomes airy and crispy on the outside, but also rich and buttery.\n\nButter is the traditional fat used in Danish pastry, but in industrial production, less expensive fats are often used, such as hydrogenated sunflower oil.\n\nIn Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the term for Danish pastry is \"wienerbrød\" or \"wienerbröd\", meaning \"Viennese bread\". The same etymology is also the origin of the Finnish \"viineri\".\nIn Vienna, the Danish pastry is called \"Kopenhagener Plunder\", referring to Copenhagen, or \"Dänischer Plunder\".\n\nThe origin of the Danish pastry is often ascribed to a strike amongst bakery workers in Denmark in 1850. The strike caused bakery owners to hire workers from abroad, among them several Austrian bakers, who brought along new baking traditions and pastry recipes. The Austrian pastry of \"Plundergebäck\" soon became popular in Denmark and after the labour disputes ended, Danish bakers adopted the Austrian recipes, adjusting them to their own liking and traditions by increasing the amount of egg and fat for example. This development resulted in what is now known as the Danish pastry.\n\nOne of the baking techniques and traditions that the Austrian bakers brought with them was the Viennese lamination technique. Due to such novelties the Danes called the pastry \"wienerbrød\" (Vienna bread) and, as mentioned, that name is still in use in Northern Europe today. At that time, almost all baked goods in Denmark were given exotic names.\n\nDanish pastries as consumed in Denmark have different shapes and names. Some are topped with chocolate, pearl sugar, glacé icing, and/or slivered nuts and they may be stuffed with a variety of ingredients such as jam or preserves (usually apple or prune), remonce, marzipan, and/or custard. Shapes are numerous, including circles with filling in the middle (known in Denmark as \"Spandauers\"), figure-eights, spirals (known as snails), and the pretzel-like kringles.\n\nIn Sweden, Danish pastry is typically made in the Spandauer-style, often with vanilla custard.\n\nIn the UK, various ingredients such as jam, custard, apricots, cherries, raisins, flaked almonds, pecans, or caramelized toffee are placed on or within sections of divided dough, which is then baked. Cardamom is often added to increase the aromatic sense of sweetness.\n\nIn the US, Danishes are typically given a topping of fruit or sweetened cream cheese prior to baking. Danishes with nuts on them are also popular there and in Sweden, where chocolate spritzing and powdered sugar are also often added.\n\nIn Argentina, they are usually filled with dulce de leche or dulce de membrillo.\n\nDanish pastry was brought to the United States by Danish immigrants. Lauritz C. Klitteng of Læsø popularized \"Danish pastry\" in the US around 1915–1920. According to Klitteng, he made Danish pastry for the wedding of President Woodrow Wilson in December 1915. Klitteng toured the world to promote his product and was featured in such 1920s periodicals as the \"National Baker\", the \"Bakers' Helper\", and the \"Bakers' Weekly\". Klitteng briefly had his own Danish Culinary Studio at 146 Fifth Avenue in New York City.\n\nHerman Gertner owned a chain of New York City restaurants and had brought Klitteng to New York to sell Danish pastry. Gertner's obituary appeared in the January 23, 1962 \"The New York Times\":\n\"At one point during his career Mr. Gertner befriended a Danish baker who convinced him that Danish pastry might be well received in New York. Mr. Gertner began serving the pastry in his restaurant and it immediately was a success.\"\n\nDuring the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy in 2006, several religious Iranian groups advocated changing the name of the highly popular Danish (\"Shriniye Danmarki\"), given its name association with the source country of the offending cartoons. The Association of Iranian Confectionery Manufacturing designated \"Roses of the Prophet Muhammad\" as the new name for danishes made in the country as of 15 February 2006, although compliance with the proposed name in bakeries was mixed and short-lived. Related to this, many protesters in several Muslim countries, angered by the pictures of Muhammad, boycotted Danish goods. \"Roses of Muhammad\" ( \"\"gole mohammadi\"\", literally: Muhammed flower) is a traditional Persian synonym for a variety of pink rose flowering shrub.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "181347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181347", "title": "Interjection", "text": "Interjection\n\nAn interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling or reaction. The category is quite heterogeneous, and includes such things as exclamations (\"ouch!\", \"wow!\"), curses (\"damn!\"), greetings (\"hey\", \"bye\"), response particles (\"okay\", \"oh!\", \"m-hm\", \"huh?\"), hesitation markers (\"uh\", \"er\", \"um\") and other words (\"stop\", \"cool\"). Due to its heterogeneous nature, the category of interjections partly overlaps with categories like profanities, discourse markers and fillers. The use and linguistic discussion of interjections can be traced historically through the Greek and Latin Modistae over many centuries.\n\nGreek and Latin intellectuals as well as the Modistae have contributed to the different perspectives of interjections in language throughout history. The Greeks held that interjections fell into the grammatical category of adverbs. They thought interjections modified the verb much in the same way as adverbs do, thus interjections were closely connected to verbs.\n\nUnlike their Greek counterparts, many Latin scholars took the position that interjections did not rely on verbs and were used to communicate emotions and abstract ideas. They considered interjections to be their own independent part of speech. Further, the Latin grammarians classified any small non-word utterances as interjections.\n\nSeveral hundred years later, the 13th- and 14th-century Modistae took inconsistent approaches to interjections. Some, such as Thomas of Erfurt, agreed with the former Greeks that the interjection was closely tied to the verb while others like Siger of Courtrai held that the interjection was its own part of speech syntactically, much like the Latin scholars.\n\nIn contrast to typical words and sentences, the function of most interjections is related to an expression of feeling, rather than representing some idea or concept. Generally, interjections can be classified into three types of meaning: volitive, emotive, or cognitive.\nWhile there exists some apparent overlap between emotive and cognitive interjections, as both express a feeling, cognitive interjections can be seen as more related to knowledge of something (i.e. information previously known to the speaker, or recently learned).\n\nInterjections may be subdivided and classified in several ways. A common distinction is based on relations to other word categories: \"primary interjections\" are interjections first and foremost (examples: \"Oops.\", \"Ouch!\", \"Huh?\"), while \"secondary interjections\" are words from other categories that come to be used as interjections in virtue of their meaning (examples: \"Damn!\", \"Hell!\") Primary interjections are generally considered to be single words (\"Oh!\", \"Wow\"!). Secondary interjections can consist of multi-word phrases, or interjectional phrases, (examples: \"sup!\" from \"What's up?\", \"Excuse me!\", \"Oh dear!\", \"Thank God!\"), but can also include single-word alarm words (\"Help!\"), swear and taboo words (\"Heavens!\"), and other words used to show emotion (\"Drats!\"). Although secondary interjections tend to interact more with the words around them, a characteristic of all interjections—whether primary or secondary—is that they can stand alone. For example, it is possible to utter an interjection like \"ouch!\" or \"bloody hell!\" on its own, whereas a different part of speech that may seem similar in function and length, such as the conjunction \"and\", cannot be uttered alone (you can't just say \"and!\" independently in English).\n\nFurther distinctions can be made based on function. Exclamations and curses are primarily about giving expression to private feelings or emotions, while response particles and hesitation markers are primarily directed at managing the flow of social interaction.\n\nMany consider interjections to fall under the part of speech of particles which also includes adverbs, fillers and onomatopoeias. As particles share many similarities, there exists confusion as to how to correctly define one subcategory from another. For example, one way to differentiate interjections from onomatopoeias is to take into account that interjections are not created by inanimate sources. That is, onomatopoeias can be created from sounds made by tools, machines, and non-animate sources in nature as well as animate sources such as animals. Thus, interjections are by and large created by animate sources which in almost all cases come from humans.\n\nInterjections are often confused as adverbs as they often appear following a form of the verb “go” causing many to think it is describing the verb instead of supplementing the utterance (example: One way to differentiate between an interjection and adverb is to find the locutor of the utterance. That is, if the locutor is making the utterance then it is an interjection. However, if the locutor is making a description of an utterance made by another locutor then it is considered an adverb.\n\nThere is also a need to make a distinction between fillers and interjections. Often considered the same, interjections belong to their own subcategory in that they are able to stand freely outside of an utterance and may include pauses without losing its semantic meaning. Further, interjections are able to begin a direct and hypothetical utterance unlike fillers. Finally, many words of expressions considered as fillers are not classified as belonging to interjections.\n\nRoutines are considered as a form of speech acts that rely on an understood social communicative pattern between the addressee and addressed. This differs from an interjection that is more of a strategic utterance within a speech act that brings attention to the utterance but may or may not also have an intended addressed (directed at an individual or group). In addition, routines generally are multi-word expressions whereas interjections tend to be single utterances.\n\nNot all scholars agree that interjections can be grouped with particles. Felix Ameka maintains that the two are distinct in that particles cannot be independent utterances and are fully a part of the syntax of the utterance. Interjections, on the other hand, can stand alone and also are always preceded by a pause, separating them from the grammar and syntax of other surrounding utterances.\n\nInterjections are bound by context, meaning that their interpretation is largely dependent on the time and place at which they are uttered. In linguistics, interjections can also be considered a form of deixis. Although their meaning is fixed (e.g. \"\"Wow!\"\" = surprised), there is also a referencing element which is tied to the situation. For example, the use of the interjection \"\"Wow!\"\" necessarily references some relation between the speaker and something that has just caused surprise to the speaker at the moment of the utterance. Without context, the listener would not know the referent of the expression (i.e. the source of the surprise). Similarly, the interjection \"\"Ouch!\"\" generally expresses pain, but also requires contextual information for the listener to determine the referent of the expression (i.e. the cause of the pain).\n\nWhile we can often see deictic or indexical elements in expressive interjections, examples of reference are perhaps more clearly illustrated in the use of imperative examples. Volitive interjections such as \"\"Ahem\"\", \"\"Psst!\"\", and \"\"Shh!\"\" could be considered imperative, as the speaker is requesting or demanding something from the listener. Similar to the deictic pronoun \"you\", the referent of these expressions changes, dependent on the context of the utterance.\n\nInterjections can take very different forms and meanings across cultures. For instance, the English interjections \"gee\" and \"wow\" have no direct equivalent in Polish, and the closest equivalent for Polish '\"fu'\" (an interjection of disgust) is the different sounding '\"Yuck!\"'. Curses likewise are famously language-specific and colourful. On the other hand, interjections that manage social interaction may be more similar across languages. For instance, the word '\"Huh?\"', used when one has not caught what someone just said, is remarkably similar in 31 spoken languages around the world, prompting claims that it may be a universal word. Similar observations have been made for the interjections \"'Oh!\"' (meaning, roughly, \"now I see\") and '\"Mm/m-hm\"' (with the meaning \"keep talking, I'm with you\").\n\nAcross languages, interjections often use special sounds and syllable types that are not commonly used in other parts of the vocabulary. For instance, interjections like '\"brr'\" and '\"shh!\"' are made entirely of consonants, where in virtually all languages, words have to feature at least one vowel-like element. Some, like '\"tut-tut\"' and \"'ahem\"', are written like normal words, but their actual production involves clicks or throat-clearing. The phonetic atypicality of some interjections is one reason they have traditionally been considered as lying outside the realm of language.\n\nSeveral English interjections contain sounds, or are sounds as opposed to words, that do not (or very rarely) exist in regular English phonological inventory. For example:\n\n"}

The cereal was created by John Harvey Kellogg in 1894 as a food that he thought would be healthy for the patients of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan where he was superintendent. The breakfast cereal proved popular among the patients and the Kellogg Company (Kellogg's) was set up by Dr. John's brother, Will Kellogg, to produce corn flakes for the wider public. A patent for the process was granted in 1896.\n\nWith corn flakes becoming popular in the wider community, a previous patient at the sanitarium, C. W. Post, started to make rival products. Kellogg continued to experiment and various ingredients were added and different grains were used. In 1928, he started to manufacture Rice Krispies, another successful breakfast cereal.\n\nThere are many generic brands of corn flakes produced by various manufacturers. As well as being used as a breakfast cereal, the crushed flakes can be a substitute for bread crumbs in recipes and can be incorporated into many cooked dishes.\n\nCorn flakes are a packaged cereal product formed from small toasted flakes of corn, usually served cold with milk and sometimes sugar. Since their original production, the plain flakes have been flavoured with salt, sugar and malt, and many successive products with additional ingredients have been manufactured such as sugar frosted flakes and honey & nut corn flakes. Corn flakes are produced in significant quantities at the Trafford Park factory in Manchester, England, which is the largest cereal factory in the world.\n\nThe story of corn flakes goes back to the late 19th century, when a team of Seventh-day Adventists began to develop new foods to adhere to the vegetarian diet recommended by the church. Members of the group experimented with a number of different grains, including wheat, oats, rice, barley and maize. In 1894, John Harvey Kellogg, the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan and an Adventist, used these recipes as part of a strict vegetarian regimen for his patients, which also included no alcohol, tobacco or caffeine. The diet he imposed consisted entirely of bland foods. A follower of Sylvester Graham, the inventor of graham crackers and graham bread, Kellogg believed that spicy or sweet foods would increase passions..\n\nThis idea for corn flakes began by accident when Kellogg and his younger brother, Will Keith Kellogg, left some cooked wheat to sit while they attended to some pressing matters at the sanitarium. When they returned, they found that the wheat had gone stale, but being on a strict budget, they decided to continue to process it by forcing it through rollers, hoping to obtain long sheets of the dough. To their surprise, what they found instead were flakes, which they toasted and served to their patients. This event occurred on August 8, 1894, and a patent for \"Flaked Cereals and Process of Preparing Same\" was filed on May 31, 1895, and issued on April 14, 1896.\nThe flakes of grain, which the Kellogg brothers called \"granose\", were a very popular food among the patients. The brothers then experimented with other flakes from other grains. In 1906, Will Keith Kellogg, who served as the business manager of the sanitarium, decided to try to mass-market the new food. At his new company, Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, he added sugar to the flakes to make them more palatable to a mass audience, but this caused a rift between his brother and him. In 1907, his same company ran an ad campaign which offered a free box of cereal to any woman who winked at her grocer. To increase sales, in 1909 he added a special offer, the \"Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet\", which was made available to anyone who bought two boxes of the cereal. This same premium was offered for 22 years. At the same time, Kellogg also began experimenting with new grain cereals to expand his product line. Rice Krispies, his next great hit, first went on sale in 1928.\n\nThere have been many mascots of Kellogg's Cornflakes. The most popular one is a green rooster named Cornelius \"Corny\" Rooster, which has been the mascot since his debut. In early commercials, he would speak the catch phrase \"Wake up, up, up to Kellogg's Cornflakes!\" Dallas McKennon and Andy Devine voiced him. Later, he stopped talking and simply crowed. The concept of using a stylized rooster originated from a suggestion by family friend Nansi Richards, a harpist from Wales and a Welsh language proponent. The Welsh word for \"rooster\" is \"ceiliog\" (pronounced \"kayleeog\" or in some dialects \"kaylog\"), sounding similar to Kellog's name.\n\nA former patient of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, C. W. Post, started a rival company to create the other major brand of corn flakes in the United States, Post Toasties or Elijah's Manna. The Australian company Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing also manufactures their own brand of corn flakes called \"Skippy corn flakes\". Many generic brands of corn flakes are produced by various manufacturers. In addition, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons, Asda Co-operative, etc. have brought out similar products based on cornflakes. A variety of corn flakes that is sold in the United Kingdom is one where honey and nuts have been added to the corn flakes, colloquially as \"honey nut corn flakes\" and as Crunchy Nut under the Kellogg's brand name.\n\nThere are a wide variety of different recipes for dishes involving corn flakes and crushed corn flakes can even be a substitute for bread crumbs.\n\n\"Honey joys\" are a popular party snack in Australia. They are made by mixing corn flakes with honey, butter and sugar and baking in patty cases or muffin cups. A variant popular in the UK is \"chocolate corn flake cakes\", made with corn flakes, dark chocolate, golden syrup and butter. In New Zealand, corn flakes are a core ingredient in Afghan biscuits, a chocolate biscuit made with corn flakes and topped with chocolate icing.\n\n"}

{"id": "182802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182802", "title": "Halva", "text": "Halva\n\nHalva (also halvah, halwa, and other spellings) is any of various dense, sweet confections made in the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is also served in the Caucasus, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Balkans, Eastern and Western Europe, Malta and in the Jewish diaspora. In some Indian cultures, the dish is known as a soup-based sweet. Identical sweets exist in other countries, such as China, though these are not generally referred to as \"halva\". The first known written halvah recipe appeared in the early 13th century Arabic Kitab al-Tabikh [The Book of Dishes].\n\nIn global, popular usage it means \"desserts\" or \"sweet\", and describes two types of desserts:\n\nHalva may also be based on various other ingredients, including beans, lentils, and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, yams and squashes.\n\nHalva can be kept at room temperature with little risk of spoilage. However, during hot summer months, it is better kept refrigerated, as it can turn runny after several days.\n\nThe word \"halva\" entered the English language between 1840 and 1850 from the Yiddish \"halva\" (), which came from the Turkish \"helva\" (حلوا), itself ultimately derived from the \"ḥalwá\", a sweet confection. The Arabic root حلو \"ḥelw\" means \"sweet\".\n\nMost types of halva are relatively dense confections sweetened with sugar or honey. Their textures, however, vary. For example, semolina-based halva is gelatinous and translucent, while sesame-based halva is drier and more crumbly.\n\nFlour based halva is made by frying flour (such as semolina) in oil, mixing it into a roux, and then cooking it with a sugary syrup. This variety is popular in India, Greece, Armenia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Somalia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. \n\nThis variety of halva is produced and served in India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, and surrounding countries (different versions of it are also found in Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Turkey). It is usually made with wheat semolina, sugar or honey, and butter or vegetable oil. Raisins, dates, other dried fruits, or nuts such as almonds or walnuts are often added to semolina halva. The halva is very sweet, with a gelatinous texture similar to polenta; the added butter gives it a rich mouth feel. The standard proportions of semolina halva are: one part fat (a vegetable oil or butter), two parts semolina, two parts sweetening agent (e.g. sugar or honey), and four parts water. The semolina is sautéed in the fat, while a syrup is made from the sweetener and water. Then the two are mixed carefully while hot, and any extra ingredients are added. At this point, the halva is off-white to light beige, and rather soft. Depending on recipe and taste, it can be cooked a bit further, which makes it darker and firmer, or left to set as is.\n\nIn India, halva is prepared in different forms. The recipes use flour, melted butter or ghee, sugar and optionally acacia gum (gum arabic, also known as Dinka or Goondh or Katira Goond or Gond or Kamarka). It comes in various colors like orange, brown, green and white; in a translucent appearance studded with raisins, cashew nuts, pistachios, almonds, etc. Technically- the term halva is used in native recipes throughout India, and though semolina halva is considered to be a quintessential \"Northern\" confection, it is also quite popular in South India. A prominent South Indian version of halva (or \"alvaa\" in Tamil) is from Tirunelveli, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu. Another semolina preparation widely enjoyed throughout South India called \"kesari\" or \"kesari-bath\" originates from the state of Karnataka.\n\nAlternative vegetable-based halva recipes popular in India and Pakistan use beetroots, potatoes, yams, and most commonly carrots (for \"gajar halwa\"), mung beans (for \"moong dal halwa\"), or bottle gourds (for \"doodi halwa\") instead of semolina. Prepared with condensed milk and ghee, without semolina to bind it together, the end result has a moist, yet flaky, texture when freshly prepared. Other examples include the famous Agra Petha- easily available at Taj Mahal, Agra.\n\nCornstarch-gelatinous halva is popular in Greece and Somalia and has many variations. The \"Farsala\" recipe is the most well known. It is quite sweet, with caramel-like syrup.\n\nThis rice flour and coconut milk halva is common fare on the streets of Zanzibar.\n\nThis type of halva is made by grinding oily seeds, such as sesame or sunflower seeds, to a paste, and then mixing with hot sugar syrup cooked to hard-crack stage. This type is popular in eastern Arab nations, the Mediterranean, and in Balkan regions and countries. Some include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Romania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Russia, Greece and Bangladesh, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, the Levant, Albania, Central Asia, southern India, the Caucasus region, and Turkey. It is also popular in Algeria and on the central Mediterranean islands of Malta.\n\nSesame halva is popular in the Balkans, Poland, Middle East, and other areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The primary ingredients in this confection are sesame butter or paste (tahini), and sugar, glucose or honey. Soapwort (called \"‘erq al halaweh\" in Arabic; \"çöven\" in Turkish), egg white, or marshmallow root are added in some recipes to stabilize the oils in the mixture or create a distinctive texture for the resulting confection. A version of sesame halva, called sesame crumble candy (芝麻酥糖) in China uses ground sesame and sugar, cooked to the hard ball stage because it is made crispier than other halvas.\n\nOther ingredients and flavorings, such as pistachio nuts, cocoa powder, orange juice, vanilla, or chocolate are often added to the basic tahini and sugar base.\n\nSunflower halva is popular in countries in Eastern Europe, including Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, and Ukraine as well as other former U.S.S.R countries. It is made of sunflower seeds instead of sesame.\n\n\"Pişmaniye\" (Turkish) or \"floss halva\" is a traditional sweet, prepared in Kocaeli, Turkey, made by flossing thin strands of halva into a light confection. Made primarily of wheat flour and sugar, the strands are continuously wrapped into a ball shape and then compressed. The result is a halva with a light consistency, similar to cotton candy. Floss halva can be found in regular and pistachio flavors, and there are brands with halal or kosher certifications.\n\nA similar pistachio-based version of floss halva is popular in North India. It tends to be slightly denser and is often referred to as \"patisa\" or \"sohan papdi\". In Chinese cuisine, a floss-like candy similar to \"pismaniye\" or \"pashmak halva\", known as \"dragon beard candy\", is eaten as a snack or dessert.\n\nA raw version of halva also has become popular among proponents of raw food diets. In this version, a mixture of raw sesame tahini, raw almonds, raw agave nectar and salt are blended together and frozen to firm.\n\nHalva can be a snack or served as part of a meal.\n\nIn Baku, \"halva\" is likely to refer to the Turkish style, tahini-based version. The most famous regional variant is from Sheki where \"Şəki halvası\" halva refers to a layered bakhlava style pastry filled with spiced-nut mix and topped by criss-crossed patterns of a red syrup made from saffron, dried carrot and beetroot. \n\nIndia has many types of halva, some unique to particular regions of the country. It is one of the popular sweets of India usually made from semolina.\n\nIt is speculated that Halva(or Halwa) was first introduced by the Persian and Arab invaders who brought the dish along with them, but written records of sweets from manosollasa indicate that semolina halwas, the most popular form of halvas in india were already known in india for instance it mentions a sweet called shali-anna which is semolina based sweet today known as kesari bat. Various types of halva from India are distinguished by the region and the ingredients from which they are prepared. In northern India, the most famous include \"sooji \" (or \"suji\") \"halva\" (semolina), \"aate ka halva\" (wheat), \"moong dal ka halva\" (mung bean halva), \"gajar halva\" (carrot) which traditionally belongs to Punjab and is referred to as \"gajrela\", \"dudhi halva\", \"chana daal halwa\" (chickpeas), and \"Satyanarayan halwa\" (variation of \"suji halwa\", with the addition of detectable traces of banana), and \"kaju halva\" (cashew nut). \"Kashi halva\", made from winter melon or ash gourd, is a famous and traditional sweet of Karnataka, and mainly makes a regular appearance in traditional Brahmin weddings. Sooji halwa is sold in many eateries in Karnataka as Kesari bhath, usually alongside pineapple.\n\n\"Halva Ardeh\" is the Iranian term for tahini-based halva, and may or may not include whole pistachios. \"Ardeh\" is processed sesame in the form of paste, usually sweetened with syrup.\n\nIn Iran, \"halva\"(حلوا) usually refers to a related confection made from wheat flour and butter and flavored with rose water. The final product has a dark brown color. The halva is spread thin on a plate till it dries into a paste. Halva usually is served at funerals and other formal ceremonies, often with almonds or coconut shavings on the top.\n\nTahini halvah (חלווה) is very popular in Israel and among Jewish people all over the world. Spelled \"halvah\" in English, it usually comes in slabs, nearly-cylindrical cakes (illustrated), or small packages, and is available in a wide variety of flavours, chocolate and vanilla being very common. The halvah is almost always parve. Israeli halvah will usually not contain wheat flour or semolina, but will contain sesame tahini, glucose, sugar, vanilla and saponaria officinalis root extracts (soapwort), which are not usually found in other recipes. It is often served as a breakfast component at Israeli hotels, though it is not usually part of an Israeli breakfast, and it is even used in specialty ice-cream.\n\nHalva can be found in ethnic Indian, Jewish, Argentine, and Middle Eastern community stores. Besides being imported from the Middle East or India (or \"Mantecol\" imported into Argentine stores), one can find the version manufactured in the U.S. by Joyva in Brooklyn, \"the largest halvah producer in the United States.\"\n\nNew York based restaurant Ilili -run by Lebanese-American Philippe Massoud- provides Halva based deserts. Greek Americans have also made this sweet popular, in Greek delis, supermarkets and homes.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran, after the burial ceremony, on the seventh and fortieth day following the death of a Muslim, and also on the first anniversary, semolina helva or flour helva is cooked and offered to visitors and neighbours by relatives of the deceased. For this reason, flour (\"un\") helva is also called in Turkish \"ölü helvası\", meaning \"helva of the dead\". The expression \"roasting the helva of someone\" suggests the person referred to died some time ago.\nIn episode 46 of the Turkish TV series Winter Sun (Kış Güneşi), İsmail tells a joke: \nThe Greek saying \"Ante re halva!\" (\"Άντε ρε χαλβά!\" – could be translated as \"get lost, you halva\") is used when the speaker wants to offend someone, usually a man, by calling him a coward and/or chubby. Another saying, dating from the period of Ottoman domination, states \"Ρωμαίικος καβγάς, τούρκικος χαλβάς\" (roughly translated as \"A fight among Greeks is halva to Turks\").\n\nIn Egypt, it is believed that halawa is a prized item within the incarcerated community, and is offered to inmates by visiting family members; this belief has often been portrayed in literature and media. This has led to the exploitation of this cultural phenomenon by a local halawa manufacturer in a recent advertising campaign.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also, to a lesser extent, Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia (Styrian part of the country), the phrase \"\"ide / prodaje se kao halva\"\" or Styrian dialect of Slovene \"\"re ko' alva\"\" (\"sells like halva\") is a colloquial expression denoting a product's sales are very high, similar to the English expression \"sells like hotcakes\" or the German expression \"\"verkauft sich wie warme Semmeln\"\" (\"sells like hot bread rolls\").\n\nIn regions of India where Hindi is a spoken language, \"हलवा है क्या?\" (\"Halwa hai kya?\") which literally translates to \"(Do you think) it is halwa?\" is a snide rhetorical question used to indicate to another person that he or she is about to do or ask for something that's far less trivial than he or she possibly comprehends. \"Halwa puri khana\" (to eat puri with halwa) is an idiom for a celebration (of possibly modest means). \"Lay halwa\" is a Bengali interjection expressing exasperation or unpleasant surprise.\n\nIn Pakistan, the term Halva Molvi is used to refer to religious people who are hypocritical and indulge in lavish life-styles.\n\nRecurring references to halvah have been made in \"Mad\" magazine over the years.\n\nAllan Sherman's song \"The Streets of Miami\", a Jewish-centered parody of \"The Streets of Laredo\" contains the line, \"I shot and Sam crumbled / Just like a piece halvah...\"\n\nA minor planet, 518 Halawe, is named after halva.\n"}

They were first manufactured in Lancashire, England in the 19th century. Their popularity waned in England before being revived by Bassett's of Sheffield, Yorkshire who were responsible for mass-producing Jelly Babies from 1918.\n\n'Jelly Babies' are known at least since advertisements by Riches Confectionery Company of 22 Duke St, London Bridge in 1885, along with a variety of other baby-sweets including 'Tiny Totties' and 'Sloper's Babies'. But the pricing of these at a farthing each suggests that they were very much larger than the modern Jelly Baby.\n\nThe sweets were invented in 1864 by an Austrian immigrant working at \"Fryers of Lancashire\" and were originally marketed as \"Unclaimed Babies\". By 1918 they were produced by Bassett's in Sheffield as \"Peace Babies\" to mark the end of World War I. Bassett's themselves have supported the \"Peace Babies\" part. Production was suspended during World War II due to wartime shortages. In 1953 the product was relaunched as \"Jelly Babies\".\n\nThe most noted modern manufacturer of Jelly Babies, Bassett's, now allocate individual name, shape, colour and flavour to different 'babies': Brilliant (red - strawberry), Bubbles (yellow - lemon), Baby Bonny (pink - raspberry), Boofuls (green - lime), Bigheart (purple - blackcurrant) and Bumper (orange). The introduction of different shapes and names was an innovation, circa 1989, prior to which all colours of jelly baby were a uniform shape. In 2007, Bassett's jelly babies changed to include only natural colours and ingredients.\n\nThere are many brands of jelly babies, as well as supermarket own brands. A line of sweets called Jellyatrics were launched by Barnack Confectionery Ltd to commemorate the Jelly Baby's 80th birthday.\n\nLike most other gummy sweets, they contain gelatin. Jelly babies manufactured in the United Kingdom tend to be dusted in starch which is left over from the manufacturing process where it is used to aid release from the mould. Jelly babies of Australian manufacture generally lack this coating.\n\nA popular science class experiment is to put them in a strong oxidising agent and see the resulting spectacular reaction. The experiment is commonly referred to as \"screaming jelly babies\".\n\nIn 1962, Jelly Babies were referred to as \"those kids' candies\" in a Supercar episode, \"Operation Superstork\". When Beatlemania broke out in 1963, fans of The Beatles in the UK pelted the band with jelly babies (or, in the US, the much harder jelly beans) after it was reported that George Harrison liked eating them.\n\nIn the British television programme \"Doctor Who\", jelly babies were often mentioned in the classic series as a confection The Doctor, an alien time traveller, favoured. First seen being consumed by the Second Doctor, they became most associated with Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor, who had a predilection for offering them to strangers in order to defuse tense situations (and in one episode bluffing another alien into thinking them a weapon). The Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Doctors, as well as the Doctor's nemesis the Master, also offered them up in different episodes. In the series, they were often identified simply by the fact the Doctor (and later the Master) usually carried them around in a simple white paper bag.\n\nIn Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series, the country of Djelibeybi (a pun on 'jelly baby', but putatively meaning 'Child of the [River] Djel', and possibly derived from Djellaba) is the Discworld's analogue of Ancient Egypt. The main setting of \"Pyramids\", the country is about two miles wide along the length of the Djel.\n\nIn May 2013, Australian singer Alison Hams released \"Jelly Baby Song\" – its content alluding to the consumption of jelly babies by type 1 diabetics to overcome hypoglycaemic episodes as a way to raise awareness for type 1 diabetes for JDRF Australia (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) who sell specially packaged jelly babies as the focus of their annual \"Jelly Baby Month\" campaign.\n\nIn 2009, a poll of 4,000 British adults voted jelly babies their sixth favourite sweet. In the 2018 film \"Johnny English Strikes Again\", the titular character (played by Rowan Atkinson) carries a box of jelly babies with him, but they are actually disguised explosives, as in said context, \"jelly\" is short for gelignite, and they blow up whoever eats them.\n"}

They are sold at retail outlets and are also available from bakeries as a take-away food. A miniature version can be served as buffet or party food.\n\nThe basic composition of a sausage roll is sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk before being baked. They can be served either hot or cold. In the 19th century, they were made using shortcrust pastry instead of puff pastry.\n\nIn the UK, the bakery chain Greggs sells around 2.5 million sausage rolls per week, or around 140 million per year.\n\nThe wrapping of meat or other foodstuffs into dough can be traced back to the Classical Greek or Roman eras. However sausage rolls in the modern sense of meat surrounded by rolled pastry, appear to have been conceived at the beginning of the 19th century in France. From the beginning, use was made of flaky pastry, which in turn originated with the Hungarian croissant of the late 17th century. Early versions of the roll with pork as a filling proved popular in London during the Napoleonic Wars and it became identified as an English dish.\n\nOn 20 September 1809, the \"Bury and Norwich Post\" mentions T. Ling, aged 75, (an industrious vendor of saloop, buns, and sausage rolls). The Times first mentions the food item in 1864 when William Johnstone, \"wholesale pork pie manufacturer and sausage roll maker\", was fined £15 (\"2015: £\"), under the Nuisances Removal Act (Amendment) Act 1863 , for having on his premises a large quantity of meat unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food. In 1894, a theft case provided further insights into the Victorian sausage roll production whereby the accused apprentice was taught to soak brown bread in red ochre, salt, and pepper to give the appearance of beef sausage for the filling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "185689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185689", "title": "Sunday roast", "text": "Sunday roast\n\nThe Sunday roast is a traditional British main meal that is typically served on Sunday (hence the name), consisting of roasted meat, roast potato, and accompaniments such as Yorkshire pudding, stuffing, vegetables and gravy. Other vegetables such as cauliflower often in the form of cauliflower cheese, roast parsnips, brussels sprouts (typically termed \"brussel sprouts\"), peas, carrots, runner beans and broccoli, can be part of the dish. The Sunday roast is also popular in many parts of Ireland, especially in most of Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and County Donegal).\n\nIts prominence in British culture is such that in a UK poll it was ranked second in a list of things people love about Britain. Other names for this meal are \"Sunday lunch\", \"roast dinner\", \"full roast\", and \"Sunday joint\" (\"joint\" referring specifically to the joint of meat). The meal is often comparable to a less grand version of a traditional Christmas dinner. \n\nBesides being served in its original homelands, the tradition of a Sunday dinner has been a major influence on food cultures in the English-speaking world. Roast dinner is also a traditionally popular dish in the Republic of Ireland.\nAn Irish Sunday roast normally comprises roast beef or chicken, potatoes (mashed and/or roast), carrots, green vegetables (such as peas, beans, or Brussels sprouts), and gravy.\nIn South Africa it is also common to have rice with a Sunday roast.\n\nThe Sunday roast originated in England as a meal to be eaten after church on Sunday. Eating a large meal following church services is common to all of the continent of Europe as with other Christian countries, but the Sunday roast variant of this meal is uniquely English. On Sundays, all types of meat and dairy produce are allowed to be eaten, unlike on Fridays where many Roman Catholics and Anglicans traditionally abstain from eating meats, so ate fish instead. Likewise, it is traditional for Anglicans and English Catholics to fast before Sunday services, with a larger meal to break the fast afterwards. \nThese religious rules created several traditional dishes in the United Kingdom.\n\nThere are two historical points on the origins of the modern Sunday roast. In the late 1700s during the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, families would place a cut of meat into the oven as they got ready for church. They would then add in vegetables such as potatoes, turnips and parsnips before going to church on a Sunday morning. When they returned from the church the dinner was all but ready. The juices from the meat and vegetables were used to make a stock or gravy to pour on top of the dinner.\nThe second opinion holds that the Sunday roast dates back to medieval times, when the village serfs served the squire for six days a week. Then, on the Sunday, after the morning church service, serfs would assemble in a field and practise their battle techniques and were rewarded with a feast of oxen roasted on a spit.\n\nTypical meats used for a Sunday roast are chicken, lamb, pork or roast beef, although seasonally duck, goose, gammon, turkey or (rarely) other game birds may be used.\n\nSunday roasts can be served with a range of boiled, steamed and/or roasted vegetables. The vegetables served vary seasonally and regionally, but will usually include roast potatoes, roasted in meat dripping or vegetable oil, and also gravy made from juices released by the roasting meat, perhaps supplemented by one or more stock cubes, gravy browning/thickening, roux or corn flour.\n\nThe potatoes can be cooked around the meat itself, absorbing the juices and fat directly (as in a traditional Cornish under-roast). However, many cooks prefer to cook the potatoes and the Yorkshire pudding in a hotter oven than that used for the joint and so remove the meat beforehand to rest and \"settle\" in a warm place.\n\nOther vegetable dishes served with roast dinner can include mashed swede or turnip, roast parsnip, boiled or steamed cabbage, broccoli, green beans and boiled carrots and peas. It is also not uncommon for leftover composite vegetable dishes—such as cauliflower cheese and stewed red cabbage—to be served alongside the more usual assortment of plainly cooked seasonal vegetables.\n\nCommon traditional accompaniments include:\n\n\nLeft-over food from the Sunday roast has traditionally formed the basis of meals served on other days of the week. For example, meats might be used as sandwich fillings, roast beef may be chopped up with leftover roasted potatoes and some additional onion and then fried in a pan with a bit of oil and desired seasonings until somewhat crispy to make roast beef hash, lamb might be used in the filling for a shepherd's pie, and vegetables might form the basis for bubble and squeak.\n\nIn the UK, many pubs serving food have a Sunday menu that features a Sunday roast, usually with a variety of meats. This is often cheaper than the normal menu, which may or may not be available on Sundays.\n\n"}

The sausage centre varies depending on geographic location (e.g Cumberland is a favoured variety in the UK while it is virtually unknown in the USA). Geography also dominates the form of the ‘blanket’ with bacon being the most common choice in the UK, while Americans choose pastry.\n\nMany are large, but other recipes call for a dish that is small in size and can be eaten in one or two bites. For this reason, they are commonly served as an appetizer or hors d'oeuvre, or are accompanied by other items during the main course. \n\nA small bite-sized form is a common hors d'oeuvre served at cocktail parties and is often accompanied by a mustard or aioli dipping sauce.\n\nPigs in a blanket are different from sausage rolls, consisting of sausage meat (different in flavour, texture and appearance to an actual sausage) wrapped in flaky pastry. These are mainly eaten in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand as a lunchtime snack.\n\n\"Pigs in a blanket\" functions as both the singular and the plural for the food. To match speakers' and listeners' notions formed by other experience with the English language, sometimes a single roll is found to be referred to as a \"pig in a blanket\" or the plural occurs as \"pigs in blankets\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"pigs in blankets\" refers to small sausages (usually chipolatas) wrapped in bacon. They are a traditional accompaniment to roast turkey in a Christmas dinner.\n\nThe naming of this food (sausage wrapped in bacon) as Pigs In Blankets in the UK is relatively recent, with first written mention in 1957, and there were previously regional variations, including \"wrapped sausages\". The pastry versions are only ever referred to as sausage rolls, varying in size from cocktail bites to jumbo versions that are a complete snack.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"pigs in a blanket\" typically refers to hot dogs in croissant rolls, but may include Vienna sausages, cocktail or breakfast/link sausages baked inside biscuit dough or croissant dough. The dough is sometimes homemade, but canned dough is most common. Pancake dough is also sometimes used, although this combination is more commonly served like a corn dog and sold as a pancake on a stick. Pigs in a blanket are somewhat similar to a sausage roll. The larger variety is served as a quick and easy main course or a light meal (particularly for children) at lunch or supper while the smaller version is served as an appetizer. In Texas, they are also referred to as kolaches, despite the term being a slight misnomer.\n\nThey are also sold in the US as \"franks in a blanket\" or \"franks in blanks\".\n\nThe name can also refer to Czech-American dish, klobasnek.\n\nThe German \"Würstchen im Schlafrock\" (\"\"sausage in a dressing gown\"\") uses sausages wrapped in puff pastry or, more rarely, pancakes. Cheese and bacon are sometimes present. - not to be confused with the English \"Pig in blanket\" - which it is not.\n\nIn Russia, this dish is named \"Сосиска в тесте (Sosiska v teste, \"\"sausage in dough\"\").\n\nIn Israel, \"Moshe Ba'Teiva\" (Moses in the basket) is a children's dish consisting of a hot dog rolled in a ketchup-covered sheet of puff pastry or phyllo dough and baked.\n\nIn Denmark, there is a dish similar to the British-style dish known as the \"Pølse i svøb\", which means \"sausage in blanket\", usually sold at hot dog stands known as \"pølsevogn\" (sausage-wagons). The American-style pigs in a blanket are known as \"Pølsehorn\", meaning \"Sausage horns\".\n\nIn Finland, pigs in blanket are known as \"nakkipiilo\", which means \"hidden sausage\" if it is translated freely.\n\nIn Mexico, the sausage is wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried in vegetable oil. The name \"salchitaco\" comes from the fusion of the words \"salchicha\" (sausage) and \"taco\" (sausage taco).\n\nIn both Australia and New Zealand, pig in a blanket is a cocktail frankfurter wrapped in bacon or puff pastry.\n\nIn China, a Chinese sausage wrapped in pastry is called \"Lap Cheong Bao\" and is steamed rather than baked. In southern Canton, particularly Hong Kong, a sausage wrapped in pastry is called \"Cheung Jai Bau\" or \"Hot Dog Bun\" and is baked instead of being steamed.\n\nIn Estonia, they are referred to as \"viineripirukas\", which means sausage pastry.\n\nIn Serbia, the dish has a name \"rol viršla\", lit. \"(hot) dog roll.\" Rol viršla is a very popular type of fast food in Serbia.\n\n"}

The filling is wrapped or layered in phyllo (filo) pastry with butter or olive oil, either in a large pan from which individual servings are cut, or rolled into individual triangular servings. While the filo-dough recipe is most common, many recipes from the Greek islands call for a crust made of flour and water to form a crunchier, calzone-like exterior in place of the flaky filo dough. The pastry is golden in colour when baked, the colour often enhanced by butter and egg yolk. Other white, fresh, preferably salted cheeses may also be mixed with, or substituted for, the feta cheese.\n\nIt can be served straight from the oven or at room temperature. There is a \"fasting\", or vegan, version of spanakopita, eaten during the Great Lent and other religious fasts, and composed of spinach, onions or green onions, other green herbs like dill, parsley or celery, olive oil and a little wheat flour, but without eggs or dairy products; the mixture is oven-baked until crisp. Non-traditional vegan versions are available that typically use tofu instead of cheese.\n\nIn rural Greece, smaller amounts of spinach are used, with the missing amount replaced with leeks, chard and sorrel. \n\nSpanakopita appears in many traditional Greek cookery books and appears in numerous restaurants and hotel menus throughout Greece and internationally. The pastry is similar to \"torta pasqualina\", a traditional dish from Italy's Liguria region, that is very common in Argentina and Uruguay, and to \"pita zeljanica\" (sometimes considered a kind of \"burek\") popular in Serbia and Bosnia. It is also a common dish in Gibraltar where cheddar or edam may replace the feta.\n\nIt can also be made with puff pastry.\n\n"}
{"id": "188294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188294", "title": "Irish whiskey", "text": "Irish whiskey\n\nIrish whiskey ( or \"uisce beatha\") is whiskey made on the island of Ireland.\n\nThe word \"whiskey\" is an Anglicisation of the first word in the Gaelic phrase, \"uisce beatha\", meaning \"water of life\" (modern Irish: \"uisce beatha\", Scottish: \"uisge\" \"beatha\" and Manx: \"ushtey bea\"). The phrase was a translation of the Latin term aqua vitae, which was commonly used to describe distilled spirits during the Middle Ages.\n\nPeat is rarely used in the malting process, so that Irish whiskey has a smoother finish as opposed to the smoky, earthy overtones common to some Scotches. There are notable exceptions to these rules in both countries; an example is Connemara peated Irish malt (double distilled) whiskey from the Cooley Distillery in Riverstown, Cooley, County Louth, Pearse Whiskey from Pearse Lyons Distillery Dublin, and the as yet unreleased whiskey from Waterford Distillery.\n\nIrish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry. So much so that although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later, this number had fallen to just three. Irish whiskey has seen a resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of August 2017, Ireland has eighteen distilleries in operation, with at least a further sixteen in the planning stages. Only six of these have been operating long enough to have products sufficiently aged for sale, and only one of these was operating prior to 1975.\n\nThe word 'whiskey' (or whisky) comes from the Irish (or 'Gaelic') \"uisce beatha\", meaning water of life. Irish whiskey was one of the earliest distilled drinks in Europe, arising around the 12th century (see Distilled beverage). It is believed that Irish monks brought the technique of distilling perfumes back to Ireland from their travels to the Mediterranean countries around 1000 A.D. The Irish then modified this technique to obtain a drinkable spirit. Although termed \"whiskey\", the spirit produced during this period would have differed from what we currently recognise as whiskey. The \"uisce beatha\" or whiskey produced in historical times would not have been aged, and was often flavoured with aromatic herbs such as mint, thyme or anise. Irish Mist, a whiskey liqueur launched in 1963, is purportedly based on such a recipe.\n\nAlthough known to have occurred for hundreds of years, records of whiskey production in Ireland can be difficult to come by, particularly in the earlier years when production was unregulated. Even in later years, as production was frequently illicit, official records bear little reflection of reality. In addition, as many Irish records were traditionally oral, rather than written, details on early production are likely lost.\n\nThe oldest known written record of whiskey comes from Ireland in 1405 in the Irish Annals of Clonmacnoise, where it was written that the head of a clan died after \"taking a surfeit of aqua vitae\" at Christmas, and its first known mention in Scotland dates from 1494. However, it is known that by 1556 whiskey was widespread, as an Act passed by the English Parliament declared whiskey to be \"a drink nothing profitable to be drunken daily and used is now universally through the realm of Ireland\". This Act also made it technically illegal for anyone other than \"the peers, gentlemen and freemen of larger towns\" to distil spirits without a licence from the Lord Deputy. However, as Crown control did not extend far beyond the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin, this had little effect.\n\nIn 1608, King James I granted one such licence to Sir Thomas Phillips, a landowner in Bushmills, County Antrim. It is through this licence that the Old Bushmills Distillery lays claim to being the oldest surviving grant of licence to distil in the world. However, the current Bushmills distillery and company was not registered to trade until 1784 which allows the Kilbeggan Distillery (formerly Locke's Distillery), founded by the McManus family in Kilbeggan, County Westmeath, which has been licensed and distilling since 1757 (not counting the period between 1954 and 2007) to lay claim to the title of the oldest licensed distillery in Ireland. Kilbeggan also has what is believed to be the oldest operational copper pot still in the world, over 250 years old.\n\nIn 1661, the Crown introduced a tax on whiskey production in Britain and Ireland. Therefore, in theory, all whiskey distillers in Ireland were to register and pay taxes. Although Crown control now extended far beyond the Pale, there is limited official record of whiskey distillation during this period. One reason for this, is that until 1761 registration was done on a voluntary basis. Therefore, as registration entailed paying a tax, it was much avoided for obvious reasons. Another reason, is that those tasked with enforcing the law were frequently local landlords, and if their tenants were the illicit distillers, it was not in their best interests to enforce the law. However, it is known that more distillation occurred than is officially recorded, as when registration later became compulsory, several registrations detail the use of existing facilities.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the introduction of this Act is a historical milestone as it provides a clear distinction between licit and illicit whiskey distillation in Ireland. For many years following the introduction of this Act, whiskey produced by registered distillers was known as \"Parliament whiskey\", while that produced by illicit producers was, and still is referred to as \"Poitín\", a Gaelic term meaning \"small pot\" (often anglicised as poteen) in reference to the small pot stills used by the illicit distillers. However, although traditionally the product of illicit production, many legal varieties of \"Poitín\" have come to market in recent years.\n\nIn the 18th century, demand for whiskey in Ireland grew significantly, driven both by strong population growth, and by displacing the demand for imported spirits. Growth in the latter is very much visible in the share of Irish duties paid on legal spirits in the late 1700s. In 1770, whiskey only accounted for 25% of the total duty on spirits received by the exchequer, while duty on imported rum accounted for 51%, with the remainder divided equally between brandy and gin. However, by 1790, only twenty years later, whiskey's share accounted for 66%.\n\nAs a consequence of this increased demand, some distillers prioritized quantity over quality, to the detriment of their product. This prompted parliament to pass an Act in 1759 prohibiting distillers from using any ingredient other than malt, grain, potatoes or sugar in the production of whiskey, and specifically prohibiting several unsavory ingredients. Another consequence, was that the potential revenue lost to the exchequer through the under-reporting of output at legal distilleries, and the tax avoidance of illicit producers became more significant, prompting parliament to introduce another Act of Parliament. This was enacted in 1779 and significantly reformed how the taxes payable on whiskey production were calculated. Previously, taxes were payable on production volumes, which were subject to manipulation. However, this Act removed the potential for under-reporting by making taxes payable on a distillery's potential output (based on the capacity of its pot stills), rather than its actual, or reported output. In addition, the Act penalised smaller distillers in an attempt to reduce reporting fraud.\n\nDue to the stringency of this Act, which made assumptions about output (for instance, a 500-gallon pot still was assumed to produce 33,075 gallons a month) and the minimum numbers of days which a still was in operation per annum (112), many of the smaller, or less efficient registered distilleries were forced underground. In 1779, when the Act was introduced, there were 1,228 registered distilleries in Ireland, however, by 1790, this number had fallen to 246, and by 1821, there were just 32 licensed distilleries in operation. This had the effect of concentrating licit distillation in a smaller number of distilleries based mainly in the larger urban centres, such as Cork and Dublin, which offered better markets for legal producers. Whereas, in the rural areas distillation became a more illicit activity. In particular, in the northwest of Ireland, where agricultural lands were poorer and poitín provided a supplemental source of income to the tenant farmers, an income which landlords were again slow to curtail as it would have weakened their abilities to pay rent. The scale of this illicit activity was such, that one surveyor estimated that duty was paid on only 2% of the spirit consumed in northwestern provinces of Ulster and Connaught, while Aeneas Coffey (an excise officer at the time, and later inventor of the Coffey Still) estimated that there were over 800 illicit stills in operation in Inishowen, County Donegal alone. By contrast, illicit distillation in Munster and Leinster was less extensive.\n\nBy some measures the Act was successful, as the volume of whiskey on which excise was paid increased from 1.2 million to 2.9 million gallons. In addition, it prompted capital investments in establishing larger distilleries (which were more easily regulated), due to the need for economies of scale to profit from legal distillation. However, when demand for whiskey increased in the early 1800s, due to population growth, and changing consumption patterns (which saw it becoming more ingrained in Irish cultural activities), much of the demand was initially met by small-scale illicit distillers who did not need to pay tax or comply with the restrictions of the 1779 Act. In fact, so much illicit spirit was available during this period that the licensed distillers in Dublin complained that it could obtained \"as openly in the streets as they sell a loaf of bread\".\n\nIn 1823, the authorities, acknowledging the problems with the licensing system, cut the duties by half, and published an Excise Act which significantly reformed the existing legislation, making legal distillation much more attractive. In particular, the reforms removed the need for distillers to rush production in order to produce as much (or more) whiskey than duties would be paid on, leading to improvements in fuel efficiency and product quality, as distillers could operate the stills at a more appropriate pace. In addition, restrictions on the type and capacity of stills used were removed, granting distillers more freedom to tailor their equipment. Another significant reform, was a change to how duty was paid. Previously, duty was charged monthly, based on still output, meaning that distilleries paid tax on whiskey before it was sold. However, under the reforms, duty was to be paid only when the whiskey was actually sold, making its storage in bond more attractive, as less of the distillery's working capital would be tied up in stock.\n\nTogether, these reforms greatly improved the distilling landscape, leading to a drop in illicit whiskey production, and a boom in investment in legal distilleries. In 1821, two years before the reforms, there were 32 licensed distilleries in Ireland. However, just four years after the reforms, this number had risen to 82 in 1827, while by 1835 it had reached 93, a 19th-century peak. The increased attractiveness of legal distillation is evident in the scale of the equipment used. Prior to the Excise Act of 1823, the largest pot still in Ireland had a capacity of just 750 gallons. However, by 1825, just two years later, the Midleton Distillery would open with a 31,618-gallon pot still, which remains the largest ever built; the largest pot stills currently in operation in the world (as of 2014), located next door in the New Midleton Distillery, are roughly half this size, at 16,498 gallons (75,000 litres).\n\nThough domestic demand would reduce somewhat in the mid-1800s, due to the Temperance movement of the 1830s, and the Great Famine of the 1840s, during which a million died, between 1823 and 1900, whiskey output in Ireland increased fourfold, and with access to the overseas markets provided by the British Empire, Irish whiskey became the most popular spirit in the World, with \"Dublin whiskey\" being particularly well regarded.\n\nIn the early 1800s, Ireland was the largest spirit market in the United Kingdom, with demand for spirit exceeding that even of more populous England. Therefore, as capacities expanded, Ireland became the largest producer of spirits in the United Kingdom, and Dublin, then the largest market for spirits in Ireland, emerged as a major distilling centre. By 1823, Dublin boasted the five largest licensed distilleries in the country. At their peak, the distilleries in Dublin would grow to become the largest in the world, with a combined output of almost 10 million gallons per annum, the largest of which, Roe's Thomas Street Distillery, had an output exceeding 2 million gallons per annum. By 1878, the reputation of Dublin whiskey was such that Distillers Company Ltd., a Scottish distilling firm, having built a distillery in Dublin, claimed that Dublin whiskey could sell for a 25% premium over other Irish whiskey, and that it had a demand five times that of Scotch at the time. Although these figures are likely inflated, they give an indication of the esteem in which Dublin whiskey was held, even by Scottish distillers.\nDuring this period, the four largest Dublin distilling firms, of John Jameson, William Jameson, John Powers and George Roe (all family run, and collectively known as the \"Big Four\") came to dominate the Irish distilling landscape. The chief output of these distilleries, known as single or \"pure pot still\" whiskey, was made from a mix of malted and unmalted barley, and solely distilled in pot stills. The style, having initially emerged as a means of avoiding a 1785 tax on malt, endured although the tax had been later repealed. In fact, even by the late 1880s, only two of Ireland's then 28 existing distilleries were producing single malt whiskey, the rest steadfast in their devotion to \"pure pot still\".\n\nIn this period, when Irish whiskey was at its zenith, it would have been difficult to imagine that Scotch, then produced by small-scale producers, and almost unheard of outside of Scotland, would soon becomes the world's preeminent drink. Whereas, Irish whiskey, then the world's most popular whiskey, would enter a century of decline, with all of Dublin's great distilleries shutting their doors. So much so, that by the late 20th century, the once popular pure pot still whiskey had almost disappeared entirely, with only two specialist bottlings, Green Spot and Redbreast remaining in existence. However, since 2010, several new single pot whiskeys have been launched.\n\nThere were a number of factors, both internal and external, which lead to this decline. However, one of the main turning points was the patenting in 1832 of the Coffey still by Aeneas Coffey. Ironically, Coffey was both the former Inspector General of Excise in Ireland, and subsequently, after leaving the excise service, an Irish distiller himself. His patent, the Coffey still, was a continuous distillation apparatus which offered an improvement on the traditional pot still. Although similar continuous stills had been proposed in the past, including by other Irish distillers themselves, the Coffey still was the most effective, and soon entered widespread use.\n\nUnlike traditional pot stills, which were operated in a batch manner, Coffey stills could be operated continuously. This made them cheaper to operate, as they required less fuel, and more efficient to run, producing a continuous, rapid output of spirit. In addition, because technically, continuous distillation entails the conduct of a series of distillation runs in sequence internally within a self-contained unit rather than the conduct of a single distillation within a pot still, Coffey stills were capable of producing a far higher strength output than pot stills. However, this advantage also came with a downside. As a consequence of increasing the alcohol concentration in the product, Coffey stills removed some of the other volatile components responsible for flavour. As a result, their use proved extremely controversial when first introduced.\n\nIreland was the initial testing ground for the Coffey still, with Coffey showcasing them in his own distillery and offering them to other Irish distillers. Although there were seven in operation in Ireland by 1833, their use did not become widespread amongst the larger distilleries. In particular, the big four Dublin distillers, proud of their existing produce, scoffed at its use, questioning if its product, grain whiskey, which they termed \"neutral\" or \"silent\" (i.e. tasteless) \"spirit\", could even be termed whiskey. It wasn't that the distillers were Luddites, afraid of change, their distilleries being amongst the most advanced in the world. The distillers were simply steadfast in the belief that their existing methods yielded a superior whiskey. For instance, John Jameson trialled a Coffey still at his distillery, but chose not adopt the technology because he was not satisfied with the quality of product it produced. Therefore, in the face of opposition in Ireland, Coffey offered his still to the English gin and Scottish whiskey distillers, who proved more receptive, and where the technology gained widespread use.\n\nThe adoption of the Coffey still in Scotland was indirectly assisted by Ireland's Great Famine of the 1840s, which lead to the repealing of the Corn Laws, which between 1815 and 1846 had restricted the import of cheaper foreign grain into Britain and Ireland. After the laws were repealed in 1846, cheap American corn could be imported and used to produce neutral spirit in Coffey stills. This spirit, though lacking in taste, could then be blended with traditional pot still derived spirit to produce, a cheaper, \"blended whiskey\". This blended whiskey, which was less intense in taste than pure pot still, was to prove popular in Britain, capturing much market share from Irish pure pot still whiskey.\n\nDespite changing tastes and falling market share, the adoption of Coffey stills was stubbornly resisted by Irish distillers for many years, with some arguing for restrictions on their use. For instance, in 1878, the big Dublin distillers jointly published a pamphlet entitled \"Truths about Whisky,\" in which they referred to the output of Coffey stills as \"\"Good, bad or indifferent; but it cannot be whiskey, and it ought not to be sold under that name\"\". In 1904, almost seventy years after it had been patented, the Senior Manager of Ireland's largest rural distillery, Allman's of Bandon, placed an outright ban on the introduction of Coffey stills at his distillery in the face of opposition from a director.\n\nThe issue came to a head in 1908, when a royal commission was appointed to investigate the issue. By this point 60% of all whiskey produced in Britain and Ireland was made in Coffey stills. In 1909, a royal commission settled the argument, declaring that whiskey could refer to the output of by either Coffey or pot stills. By comparison, a similar debate occurred in France; such that under French law, to be termed \"Cognac\", a spirit must be produced using a pot still. Whereas, Coffey stills are permissible in the production of armagnac.\n\nIn addition to the introduction of blended whiskey, and the Irish distillers' failure to account for its appeal to changing tastes, there were a number of additional issues which placed further pressure on the Irish distillers: the Irish War of Independence, the subsequent civil war, and trade war with Britain (which cut off whiskey exports to Britain and all Commonwealth countries, then Irish whiskey's biggest market); prohibition in the United States (1920-1933), which severely curtailed exports to Irish whiskey's second biggest market; widespread counterfeiting of Irish whiskeys in America and Britain; protectionist policies introduced by the Irish Free State Government, which significantly capped whiskey exports in the hope of taxing domestic consumption; and finally, over-expansion and mismanagement at several Irish distilleries. Together, these factors greatly hampered exports and forced many distilleries into economic difficulties and out of business, and by the early 20th century, Scotland had surpassed Ireland to become the World's largest whiskey producer.\n\nWhen Alfred Barnard, a British historian, published his account of the distilleries of Britain and Ireland in 1887, there were 28 distilleries in operation in Ireland. By the 1960s, there was only a handful of these remaining in operation, and in 1966, three of these (John Jameson, Powers, and Cork Distilleries Company) chose to amalgamate their operations under the name of Irish Distillers and to close their existing facilities and concentrate their operations in a new purpose-built facility to be constructed beside the Old Midleton Distillery in Co. Cork. In 1972, these were joined by the only other remaining Irish operation, Bushmills, so that by the mid-1970s there were only two whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland, the New Midleton Distillery and the Old Bushmills Distillery, both owned by Irish Distillers, and with only one of these having operated during Irish whiskey's golden years.\n\nProduction reached a nadir at about 400,000–500,000 cases per annum during this period, down from a height of 12 million cases around 1900. The late 1980s saw the beginnings of a long and slow resurgence in the Irish whiskey industry, with the establishment of the Cooley Distillery in 1987, and Pernod Ricard's takeover of Irish Distillers in 1988, which led to increased marketing of Irish whiskeys, in particular Jameson, overseas. Since then Irish whiskey has undergone a major resurgence, and for the past twenty years, has been the fastest growing spirit in the world, with annual growth of approximately 15–20% per annum. In 2010, the Kilbeggan Distillery, which had closed in 1954, reopened, bringing the number of operating distilleries up to four. By August 2017, this figure had grown to eighteen, with at least sixteen more in the planning stages. As of 2016, sales of Irish whiskey stood at 8.7 million 9-litres cases, up from 4.4 million cases in 2008, with sales projected to exceed 12 million cases (its historical peak) by 2020, and 24 million by 2030. As of 2017, roughly 750 people are employed on a full-time basis in the whiskey industry in Ireland. In addition, it is estimated that the industry provides support to a further 4,200 jobs across agriculture and other sectors of the economy.\n\nIrish whiskey is a protected European Geographical Indication (GI) under Regulation (EC) No 110/2008. As of 29 January 2016, production, labelling and marketing of Irish whiskey must be verified by the Irish revenue authorities as conforming with the Department of Agriculture's 2014 technical file for Irish whiskey.\nKey requirements include specifications that: \n\nThere are several regulations governing the labelling of Irish whiskeys. In particular: \n\nAccording to the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland, as of August 2017 there are 18 whiskey distilleries in operation in Ireland. However, many of these are recently established and have not yet aged their own spirits for sale as whiskey:\n\nIn addition, there are a number of independently owned brands, such as Clontarf 1014, that purchase and market whiskey sourced from operating distilleries.\n\nAccording to the Alcoholic Beverage Federation of Ireland, as of November 2016, at least thirteen new distilleries have been granted planning permission in Ireland, with many other projects in various stages of planning. In addition, to the \"Alltech\" and \"Glendalough\" distilleries mentioned above, which had previously distilled spirit, planned distilleries include:\n\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries, around 1,000 registered distilleries opened and closed across Ireland - with multiples of this number operating illegally. Most of these have disappeared without a trace, only to be remembered by local street names e.g. Bond Street in Dublin. For instance, the excise return for 1800 lists 40 distilleries operating in Dublin city alone, while Drogheda is estimated to have had 15 distilleries in the 1780s, with as many as ten operating in Cork city in the 19th century. Of these numerous ventures, only one, Bushmills, has remained in continuous operation until the present day. However, the Kilbeggan Distillery (est. 1757) which closed in 1954, reopened in recent years, while a new distillery was constructed in Tullamore to replace an existing distillery which also closed in 1954. Some of the notable distilleries previously in operation across Ireland are listed below.\n\nIrish whiskey comes in several forms, with the name of the style depending on the type of grain used and the distillation process. Traditionally, Irish whiskey was produced in pot stills. Irish whiskeys made in a pot still fall into two categories.\n\nWhiskeys made entirely from malted barley distilled in a pot still within a single distillery are referred to as single malt whiskeys, a style also very commonly associated with Scotch whisky. These may be double or triple distilled.\n\nSingle pot still whiskey is made from a mixture of malted and unmalted barley completely distilled in a pot still within a single distillery. This differs from single malt whiskey through the inclusion of raw, unmalted grain in the mash. This style has also historically been referred to as \"pure pot still\" whiskey and \"Irish pot still whiskey\", with older bottlings and memorabilia often bearing these names. Single pot whiskeys were the most common style of Irish whiskey until the emergence of blends in the 20th century.\n\nWhiskey produced from continuous distillation in a column or Coffey still, rather than a pot still, is referred to as grain whiskey. This may be produced from a variety of grains. Lighter and more neutral in taste, this spirit is rarely found on its own, though some examples exist. The vast majority of grain whiskey is used to make blended whiskey, a product made by mixing column still product with richer and more intense pot still product.\n\nA mixture of the above styles. Regardless of whether the blended whiskey is made from combining grain whiskey with either single malt whiskey or with single pot still whiskey or both, it is labelled with the same terminology. Blended whiskeys are now the most common style of both Irish and Scotch whiskeys.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "188904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188904", "title": "Pasty", "text": "Pasty\n\nA pasty ( or , ) is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall and Devon, United Kingdom. It is made by placing an uncooked filling, typically meat and vegetables, on one half of a flat shortcrust pastry circle, folding the pastry in half to wrap the filling in a semicircle and crimping the curved edge to form a seal before baking.\n\nThe traditional Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status in Europe, is filled with beef, sliced or diced potato, swede (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall as turnip) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and is baked. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It is regarded as the national dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made and some shops specialise in selling all sorts of pasties.\n\nThe origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide due to the spread of Cornish miners and sailors from across Devon and Cornwall, and variations can be found in Australia, the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Ulster and elsewhere.\n\nDespite the modern pasty's strong association with Cornwall, its exact origins are unclear. The English word \"pasty\" derives from Medieval French (O.Fr. \"paste\" from V.Lat \"pasta\") for a pie, filled with venison, salmon or other meat, vegetables or cheese, baked without a dish. Pasties have been mentioned in cookbooks throughout the ages. For example, the earliest version of \"Le Viandier\" (Old French) has been dated to around 1300 and contains several pasty recipes. In 1393, \"Le Menagier de Paris\" contains recipes for \"pasté\" with venison, veal, beef, or mutton.\n\nOther early references to pasties include a 13th-century charter that was granted by Henry III (1207–1272) to the town of Great Yarmouth. The town is bound to send to the sheriffs of Norwich every year \"one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties\", which the sheriffs are to deliver to the lord of the manor of East Carlton who is then to convey them to the King. Around the same time, 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris wrote of the monks of St Albans Abbey \"according to their custom, lived upon pasties of flesh-meat\". A total of 5,500 venison pasties were served at the installation feast of George Neville, archbishop of York and chancellor of England in 1465. \nThe earliest reference for the Devon pasty can be found in Plymouth City Records of 1509/10, which describe \"Itm for the cooke is labor to make the pasties 10d.\" \nThey were even eaten by royalty, as a letter from a baker to Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour (1508–1537) confirms: \"...hope this pasty reaches you in better condition than the last one ...\" In his diaries written in the mid-17th century, Samuel Pepys makes several references to his consumption of pasties, for instance \"dined at Sir W. Pen's ... on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil.\", but after this period the use of the word outside Cornwall declined.\n\nIn contrast to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it due to its unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.\n\nSide-crimped pasties gave rise to the suggestion that the miner might have eaten the pasty holding the thick edge of pastry, which was later discarded, thereby ensuring that his dirty fingers (possibly including traces of arsenic) did not touch food or his mouth. However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or muslin and were eaten from end to end; according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is \"the true Cornish way\" to eat a pasty. Another theory suggests that pasties were marked at one end with an initial and then eaten from the other end so that if not finished in one go, they could easily be reclaimed by their owners.\n\nThe pasty is regarded as the national dish of Cornwall, and the term \"Cornish pasty\" has been in use since at least the early 1860s:\n\nBy the late 19th century, national cookery schools began to teach their pupils to create their own version of a \"Cornish pasty\" that was smaller, and was to be eaten as an \"economical savoury nibble for polite middle-class Victorians\".\n\nOn 20 July 2011, after a nine-year campaign by the Cornish Pasty Association – the trade organisation of about 50 pasty makers based in Cornwall – the name \"Cornish pasty\" was awarded Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status by the European Commission. According to the PGI status, a Cornish pasty should be shaped like a 'D' and crimped on one side, not on the top. Its ingredients should include beef, swede (called turnip in Cornwall), potato and onion, with a light seasoning of salt and pepper, keeping a chunky texture. The pastry should be golden and retain its shape when cooked and cooled. The PGI status also means that Cornish pasties must be prepared in Cornwall. They do not have to be baked in Cornwall, nor do the ingredients have to come from the county, though the Cornish Pasty Association (CPA) noted that there are strong links between pasty production and local suppliers of the ingredients. Packaging for pasties that conform to the requirements includes an authentication stamp, the use of which is policed by the CPA.\n\nProducers outside Cornwall objected to the PGI award, with one saying \"[EU bureaucrats could] go to hell\", and another that it was \"protectionism for some big pasty companies to churn out a pastiche of the real iconic product\". Major UK supermarkets Asda and Morrisons both stated they would be affected by the change, as did nationwide bakery chain Greggs, though Greggs was one of seven companies allowed to continue to use the name \"Cornish pasty\" during a three-year transitional period.\n\nMembers of the CPA made about 87 million pasties in 2008, amounting to sales of £60 million (about 6% of the food economy of Cornwall). In 2011, over 1,800 permanent staff were employed by members of the CPA and some 13,000 other jobs benefited from the trade. Surveys by the South West tourism board have shown that one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall is the food and that the Cornish pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall.\n\nMichael Ball, a Cornish-born businessman who is chief executive of WMC Retail Partners, Oxfordshire, is planning to establish a Cornish pasty museum at Cornish Market World near St Austell. He hopes to collect pasty-making artifacts and memorabilia for the museum.\n\nThe recipe for a Cornish pasty, as defined by its protected status, includes diced or minced beef, onion, potato and swede in rough chunks along with some \"light peppery\" seasoning. The cut of beef used is generally skirt steak. Swede is sometimes called turnip in Cornwall, but the recipe requires use of actual swede, not turnip. Pasty ingredients are usually seasoned with salt and pepper, depending on individual taste. The use of carrot in a traditional Cornish pasty is frowned upon, though it does appear regularly in recipes.\n\nThe type of pastry used is not defined, as long as it is golden in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, although modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.\n\nAlthough the officially protected Cornish pasty has a specific ingredients list, old Cornish cookery books show that pasties were generally made from whatever food was available. Indeed, the earliest recorded pasty recipes include venison, not beef. \"Pasty\" has always been a generic name for the shape and can contain a variety of fillings, including stilton, vegetarian and even chicken tikka. Pork and apple pasties are readily available in shops throughout Cornwall and Devon, with the ingredients including an apple flavoured sauce, mixed together throughout the pasty, as well as sweet pasties with ingredients such as apple and fig or chocolate and banana, which are common in some areas of Cornwall.\n\nA part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the Bedfordshire clanger) was eaten by miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on Parys Mountain, Anglesey. The technician who did the research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work. No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today, but are usually the product of amateur cooks. They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain Morrisons (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty'). Other traditional fillings have included a wide variety of locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, mackerel and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, jam and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.\n\nA pasty is known as a \"tiddy oggy\" when steak is replaced with an extra potato, \"tiddy\" meaning potato and \"oggy\" meaning pasty and was eaten when times were hard and expensive meat could not be afforded. Another traditional meatless recipe is 'herby pie' with parsley, freshly gathered wild green herbs and chives, ramsons or leeks and a spoonful of clotted cream.\n\nWhilst the PGI rules state that a Cornish pasty must be a \"D\" shape, with crimping along the curve (i.e., side-crimped), crimping is variable within Cornwall, with some advocating a side crimp while others maintain that a top crimp is more authentic.\n\nSome sources state that the difference between a Devon and Cornish pasty is that a Devon pasty has a top-crimp and is oval in shape, whereas the Cornish pasty is semicircular and side-crimped along the curve. However, pasties with a top crimp have been made in Cornwall for generations, yet those Cornish bakers who favour this method now find that they cannot legally call their pasties \"Cornish\".\n\nMigrating Cornish miners and their families (colloquially known as Cousin Jacks and Cousin Jennies) helped to spread pasties into the rest of the world during the 19th century. As tin mining in Cornwall began to decline, miners took their expertise and traditions to new mining regions around the world. As a result, pasties can be found in many regions, including:\n\n\nPasties have been mentioned in multiple literary works since the 12th century Arthurian romance \"Erec and Enide\", written by Chrétien de Troyes, in which they are eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall. There is a mention in Havelok the Dane, another romance written at the end of the thirteenth century; in the 14th century Robin Hood tales; in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\"; and in three plays by William Shakespeare.\n\nPasties appear in many novels, used to draw parallels or represent Cornwall. In \"American Gods\" by Neil Gaiman, main character Shadow discovers pasties at Mabel's restaurant in the fictional town of Lakeside. The food is mentioned as being popularised in America by Cornishmen, as a parallel to how gods are \"brought over\" to America in the rest of the story. Another literature reference takes place in \"The Cat Who\" ... series by Lilian Jackson Braun. Pasties are referred to as a cultural part of the north country, and Jim Qwilleran often eats at The Nasty Pasty, a popular restaurant in fictional Moose County, famous for its tradition of being a mining settlement. Reference to pasties is made in Brian Jacques' popular \"Redwall\" series of novels, where it is a staple favourite on the menu to the mice and hares of Redwall Abbey. Pasties also appear in the \"Poldark\" series of historical novels of Cornwall, by Winston Graham, as well as the BBC television series adapted from these works.\n\nIn the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were associated with \"knockers\", spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore, or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the knockers, miners would leave a small part of the pasty within the mine for them to eat. Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was bad luck to take a pasty aboard ship.\n\nA Cornish proverb, recounted in 1861, emphasised the great variety of ingredients that were used in pasties by saying that the devil would not come into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a filling in one. A West Country schoolboy playground-rhyme current in the 1940s concerning the pasty went: In 1959 the English singer-songwriter Cyril Tawney wrote a nostalgic song called \"The Oggie Man\". The song tells of the pasty-seller with his characteristic vendor's call who was always outside Plymouth's Devonport Naval Dockyard gates late at night when the sailors were returning, and his replacement by hot dog sellers after World War II.\n\nThe word \"oggy\" in the internationally popular chant \"Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi\" is thought to stem from Cornish dialect \"\"hoggan\"\", deriving from \"hogen\" the Cornish word for pasty. When the pasties were ready for eating, the bal maidens at the mines would supposedly shout down the shaft \"Oggy Oggy Oggy\" and the miners would reply \"Oi Oi Oi\".\n\nAs the national dish of Cornwall, several oversized versions of the pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is passed over the goal posts.\n\nThe world's largest Cornish pasty was made in August 2010, measuring and weighing . It was created by \"Proper Cornish\" bakers, using of beef, of swede, of potatoes and of onions. The pasty was estimated to cost £7,000 and contain 1.75 million calories.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "189345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189345", "title": "Sourdough", "text": "Sourdough\n\nSourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast, and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.\n\nSourdough is a dough containing a \"Lactobacillus\" culture in symbiotic combination with yeasts. It is one of the principal means of biological leavening in bread baking, the others using cultivated forms of yeast.\n\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology\", Michael Gaenzle writes: \"The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation. One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent several thousand years earlier ... Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years.\"\n\nPliny the Elder described the sourdough method in his \"Natural History\":\n\nSourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages until being replaced by barm from the beer brewing process, and then later purpose-cultured yeast.\n\nBread made from 100% rye flour, popular in the northern half of Europe, is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a leavening agent for rye bread, as rye does not contain enough gluten. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the starch in the flour, as well as other carbohydrates known as pentosans; however, rye amylase is active at substantially higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during cooking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. In the southern part of Europe, where panettone was originally made with sourdough, sourdough has become less common in recent times; it has been replaced by the faster-growing baker's yeast, sometimes supplemented with longer fermentation rests to allow for some bacterial activity to build flavor.\n\nFrench bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture of San Francisco today. The nickname remains in \"Sourdough Sam\", the mascot of the San Francisco 49ers. Sourdough has long been associated with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make bread with commercial yeast or baking soda. The \"celebrated\" San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced sourness, and indeed the strain of \"Lactobacillus\" in sourdough starters is named \"Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis\", alongside the sourdough yeast \"Candida milleri\" found in the same cultures.\n\nThe sourdough tradition was carried into Alaska and the western Canadian territories during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Conventional leavenings such as yeast and baking soda were much less reliable in the conditions faced by the prospectors. Experienced miners and other settlers frequently carried a pouch of starter either around their neck or on a belt; these were fiercely guarded to keep from freezing. However, freezing does not kill a sourdough starter; excessive heat does. Old hands came to be called \"sourdoughs\", a term that is still applied to any Alaskan or Klondike old-timer. The significance of the nickname's association with Yukon culture was immortalized in the writings of Robert Service, particularly his collection of \"Songs of a Sourdough\".\n\nIn English-speaking countries, where wheat-based breads predominate, sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers.\n\nManufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially-made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.\n\nThe preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the \"starter\" or \"leaven\", also known as the \"chief\", \"chef\", \"head\", \"mother\" or \"sponge\"), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli. The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters, as the ratio of water to flour in the starter (\"hydration\") varies. A starter may be a liquid batter or a stiff dough.\n\nFlour naturally contains a variety of yeasts and bacterial spores. When wheat flour comes into contact with water, the naturally occurring enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into the sugars glucose and maltose, which sourdough's natural yeast can metabolize. With sufficient time, temperature, and refreshments with new or fresh dough, the mixture develops a stable culture. This culture will cause a dough to rise if the gluten has been developed sufficiently. The bacteria ferment maltose that the yeast cannot metabolise, and the byproducts are metabolised by the yeast which produces carbon dioxide gas, leavening the dough.\n\nObtaining a satisfactory rise from sourdough takes longer than a dough leavened with baker's yeast because the yeast in a sourdough is less vigorous. In the presence of lactic acid bacteria, however, some sourdough yeasts have been observed to produce twice the gas of baker's yeast. The acidic conditions in sourdough, along with the bacteria also producing enzymes that break down proteins, result in weaker gluten and may produce a denser finished product.\n\nAs it ferments, sometimes for several days, the volume of the starter is increased by periodic additions of flour and water, called \"refreshments\". As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly it will remain active.\n\nThe ratio of fermented starter to fresh flour and water is critical in the development and maintenance of a starter. This ratio is called the \"refreshment ratio\". Higher refreshment ratios are associated with greater microbial stability in the sourdough. In San Francisco sourdough, the ratio is 40% of the total weight, which is roughly equivalent to 67% of the new-dough's weight. A high refreshment ratio keeps acidity of the refreshed dough relatively low. Acidity levels of below pH 4.0 inhibit lactobacilli and favour acid-tolerant yeasts.\n\nA starter prepared from scratch with a salted wheat-rye dough takes about 54 hours at to stabilise at a pH between 4.4 and 4.6. 4% salt inhibits \"L. sanfranciscensis\", while \"C. milleri\" can withstand 8%.\n\nA drier and cooler starter has less bacterial activity and more yeast growth, which results in the bacterial production of more acetic acid relative to lactic acid. Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid. The yeasts produce mainly CO and ethanol. High amounts of lactic acid are desired in rye and mixed-rye fermentations, while relatively higher amounts of acetic acid are desired in wheat fermentations. A dry, cool starter produces a sourer loaf than a wet, warm one. Firm starters (such as the Flemish Desem starter, which may be buried in a large container of flour to prevent drying out) tend to be more resource-intensive than wet ones.\n\nA stable culture in which \"L. sanfranciscensis\" is the dominant bacterium requires a temperature between and refreshments every 24 hours for about two weeks. Refreshment intervals of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.\n\nThe intervals between refreshments of the starter may be reduced in order to increase the rate of gas (CO) production, a process described as \"acceleration.\" In this process, the ratio of yeasts to lactobacilli may be altered. Generally, if once-daily refreshment-intervals have not been reduced to several hours, the percentage amount of starter in the final dough should be reduced to obtain a satisfactory rise during proof.\n\nFaster starter processes, requiring fewer refreshments, have been devised, sometimes using commercial sourdough starters as inoculants. These starters generally fall into two types. One is made from traditionally maintained and stable starter doughs, often dried, in which the ratios of microorganisms are uncertain. Another is made from microorganisms carefully isolated from Petri dishes, grown into large, homogeneous populations in fermentors, and processed into combined baker's products with numerically defined ratios and known quantities of microorganisms well suited to particular bread styles.\n\nBakers have devised several ways of encouraging a stable culture of micro-organisms in the starter. Unbleached, unbromated flour contains more micro-organisms than more processed flours. Bran-containing (wholemeal) flour provides the greatest variety of organisms and additional minerals, though some cultures use an initial mixture of white flour and rye or whole wheat flour or \"seed\" the culture using unwashed organic grapes (for the wild yeasts on their skins). Grapes and grape must are also sources of lactic acid bacteria, as are many other edible plants. Basil leaves are soaked in room-temperature water for an hour to seed traditional Greek sourdough. Using water from boiled potatoes is said to increase the activity of the bacteria by providing additional starch.\n\nThe piped drinking water supplied in most urban areas is treated by chlorination or chloramination, adding small amounts of substances that inhibit potentially dangerous micro-organisms but are harmless to animals. Some bakers recommend unchlorinated water for feeding cultures. Because a sourdough fermentation relies on microorganisms, using water without these agents may produce better results. Bottled drinking water is suitable; chlorine, but not chloramines, can be removed from tap water by boiling it for a time, or simply by leaving it uncovered for at least 24 hours. Chlorine and chloramines can both be removed by activated carbon filters and other methods.\n\nAdding a small quantity of diastatic malt provides maltase and simple sugars to support the yeasts initially.\n\nBakers often make loaves with fermented dough from a previous batch (which they call \"mother dough\", \"mother sponge\", \"chef\", or \"seed sour\") rather than making a new starter every time they bake. The original starter culture may be many years old. Because of their pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, such cultures are stable and able to prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria. For this reason, sourdough products inherently keep fresh for a longer time than other breads, and are good at resisting spoilage and mold without the additives required to retard spoiling of other types of bread.\n\nThe flavour of sourdough bread varies from place to place according to the method used, the hydration of the starter and the final dough, the refreshment ratio, the length of the fermentation periods, ambient temperature, humidity, and elevation, all of which contribute to the microbiology of the sourdough.\n\nThe starter is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into loaves, left to rise, and then baked.\n\nBecause the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.\n\nSourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. Broadly speaking, the yeast produces gas (carbon dioxide) which leavens the dough, and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor in the form of sourness. The lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast cannot, while the yeast metabolizes the byproducts of lactic acid fermentation.\n\nLactic acid bacteria are aerotolerant anaerobes, which means that though they are anaerobes, they can multiply in the presence of oxygen. Hammes and Vogel in 1995 distinguished three metabolic groups of lactic acid bacteria:\n\nThe phylogenetic groupings of \"Lactobacillus\" species have been undergoing reclassification, first being studied in 1991 by Collins, \"et al\". In 1995, Hammes and Vogel phylogenetically grouped \"L. sanfranciscensis\" to \"L. casei-Pediococcus\". In 2003, Hammes and Hertel grouped it to \"L. buchneri\". In 2007, Dellaglio and Felis grouped it to \"L. fructivorans\".\n\nThe most common yeast species in sourdough are \"Kazachstania exigua (Saccharomyces exiguous)\", \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", \"Candida milleri\", and \"Candida humilis\".\n\nTraditional San Francisco sourdough is a Type I sourdough. Type I sourdoughs are generally firm doughs, have a pH range of 3.8 to 4.5, and are fermented in a temperature range of . \"Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis\" was named for its discovery in San Francisco sourdough starters, though it is not endemic to San Francisco. \"Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis\" and \"L. pontis\" often highlight a lactic-acid bacterial flora that includes \"L. fermentum\", \"L. fructivorans\", \"L. brevis\", and \"L. paralimentarius\". The yeasts \"Saccharomyces exiguus\", \"Candida milleri\", or \"Candida holmii\" usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with \"Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis\". The perfect yeast \"S. exiguus\" is related to the imperfect yeasts \"C. milleri\" and \"C. holmii\". \"Torulopsis holmii\", \"Torula holmii\", and \"S. rosei\" are synonyms used prior to 1978. \"C. milleri\" and \"C. holmii\" are physiologically similar, but DNA testing established them as distinct. Other yeasts reported found include \"C. humilis\", \"C. krusei\", \"Pichia anomaola\", \"C. peliculosa\", \"P. membranifaciens\", and \"C. valida\". There have been changes in the taxonomy of yeasts in recent decades. \"L. sanfranciscensis\" requires maltose, while \"C. milleri\" is maltase negative and thus cannot consume maltose. \"C. milleri\" can grow under conditions of low pH and relatively high acetate levels, a factor contributing to sourdough flora's stability.\n\nIn order to produce acetic acid, \"L. sanfrancisensis\" needs maltose and fructose. Wheat dough contains abundant starch and some polyfructosanes, which enzymes degrade to \"maltose, fructose and little glucose.\" The terms \"fructosan, glucofructan, sucrosyl fructan, polyfructan, and polyfructosan\" are all used to describe a class of compounds that are \"structurally and metabolically\" related to sucrose, where \"carbon is stored as sucrose and polymers of fructose (fructans).\" Yeasts have the ability to free fructose from glucofructans which compose about 1–2% of the dough. Glucofructans are long strings of fructose molecules attached to a single glucose molecule. Sucrose can be considered the shortest glucofructan, with only a single fructose molecule attached. When \"L. sanfrancisensis\" reduces all available fructose, it stops producing acetic acid and begins producing ethanol. If the fermenting dough gets too warm, the yeasts slow down, producing less fructose. Fructose depletion is more of a concern in doughs with lower enzymatic activities.\n\nA Belgian study of wheat and spelt doughs refreshed once every 24 hours and fermented at in a \"laboratory environment\" provides insight into the three-phase evolution of first-generation-to-stable sourdough ecosystems. In the first two days of refreshment, atypical genera \"Enterococcus\" and \"Lactococcus\" bacteria highlighted the doughs. During days 2–5, sourdough-specific bacteria belonging to the genera \"Lactobacillus\", \"Pediococcus\", and \"Weissella\" outcompete earlier strains. Yeasts grew more slowly and reached population peaks near days 4–5. By days 5–7, \"well-adapted\" \"Lactobacillus\" strains such as \"L. fermentum\" and \"L. plantarum\" had emerged. At their peaks, yeast populations were in the range of about 1–10% of the lactobacilli populations or 1:10–1:100. One characteristic of a stable dough is that the heterofermentative have outcompeted homofermentative lactobacilli.\n\nInvestigations of wheat sourdough found that \"S. cerevisiae\" died off after two refreshment cycles. \"S. cerevisiae\" has less tolerance to acetic acid than other sourdough yeasts. Continuously maintained, stable sourdough cannot be unintentionally contaminated by \"S. cerevisiae.\"\n\nIn Type II sourdoughs, baker's yeast or \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" is added to leaven the dough; \"L. pontis\" and \"L. panis\" highlight the flora. They have a pH less than 3.5, and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings, which reduces the flora's activity. This process was adopted by some in industry, in part, due to simplification of the multiple-step build typical of Type I sourdoughs.\n\nIn Type II sourdoughs, yeast growth is slowed or stopped due to higher fermentation temperatures. These doughs are more liquid and once fermented may be chilled and stored for up to a week. They are pumpable and used in continuous bread production systems.\n\nType III sourdoughs are Type II sourdoughs subjected to a drying process, usually either spray or drum drying, and are mainly used at an industrial level as flavoring agents. They are dominated by \"drying-resistant [lactic acid bacteria] such as \"Pediococcus pentosaceus\", \"Lactobacillus plantarum\", and \"L. brevis\".\" The drying conditions, time and heat applied, may be varied in order to influence caramelization and produce desired characteristics in the baked product.\n\nThere are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread. Danish rugbrød (\"rye bread\") is a dense, dark bread best known from its use in the Danish smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches). The Mexican salty birote started out in the city of Guadalajara as a short French baguette that replaces the yeast with a sourdough fermentation process, yielding a bread that is crunchy outside but soft and savory inside. Amish friendship bread uses a sourdough starter that includes sugar and milk. It is also leavened with baking powder and baking soda. An Amish sourdough is fed with sugar and potato flakes every 3–5 days. German pumpernickel is traditionally made from a sourdough starter, although modern pumpernickel loaves often use commercial yeasts, sometimes spiked with citric acid or lactic acid to inactivate the amylases in the rye flour. Flemish desem bread (the word means 'starter') is a whole-wheat sourdough. In Azerbaijan, whole-wheat sourdough flatbreads are traditionally eaten. In Ethiopia, teff flour is fermented to make injera. A similar variant is eaten in Somalia, Djibouti, and Yemen (where it is known as lahoh). In India, idlis and dosa are made from a sourdough fermentation of rice and \"Vigna mungo\".\n\nAlthough sourdough breads made from wheat, rye, barley, and other cereal grains may cause gluten sensitivity, sourdough fermentation and lactic acid bacteria may be useful to improve the quality of gluten-free breads, such as by enhancing texture, aroma, and shelf life, which can be extended by inhibition of mycotoxins associated with fungal contamination.\n\nSourdough bread has a relatively low glycemic index compared with other types of bread. The acidity of sourdough bread during fermentation may inhibit formation of phytates which affect the absorption of some dietary minerals. In one review, sourdough bread made from whole grains was recommended as a key daily food in the Italian Mediterranean diet.\n\n"}
{"id": "189616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189616", "title": "Eudaimonia", "text": "Eudaimonia\n\nEudaimonia (Greek: ), sometimes anglicized as eudaemonia or eudemonia , is a Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, \"human flourishing or prosperity\" has been proposed as a more accurate translation. Etymologically, it consists of the words \"\"eu\"\" (\"good\") and \"\"daimōn\"\" (\"spirit\"). It is a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and political philosophy, along with the terms \"aretē\", most often translated as \"virtue\" or \"excellence\", and \"phronesis\", often translated as \"practical or ethical wisdom\". In Aristotle's works, eudaimonia (based on older Greek tradition) was used as the term for the highest human good, and so it is the aim of practical philosophy, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider (and also experience) what it really is, and how it can be achieved.\n\nDiscussion of the links between virtue of character (\"ēthikē aretē\") and happiness \"(eudaimonia)\" is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of much disagreement. As a result there are many varieties of eudaimonism. Two of the most influential forms are those of Aristotle and the Stoics. Aristotle takes virtue and its exercise to be the most important constituent in eudaimonia but acknowledges also the importance of external goods such as health, wealth, and beauty. By contrast, the Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.\n\nThe \"Definitions\", a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to Plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the Academy, provides the following definition of the word eudaimonia: \"The good composed of all goods; an ability which suffices for living well; perfection in respect of virtue; resources sufficient for a living creature.\"\n\nIn his \"Nicomachean Ethics\" (§21; 1095a15–22), Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for human beings, but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well; i.e. eudaimon:\n\nVerbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour… [1095a17]\n\nSo, as Aristotle points out, saying that eudaimon life is a life which is objectively desirable, and means living well, is not saying very much. Everyone wants to be eudaimon; and everyone agrees that being eudaimon is related to faring well and to an individual's well being. The really difficult question is to specify just what sort of activities enable one to live well. Aristotle presents various popular conceptions of the best life for human beings. The candidates that he mentions are a (1) life of pleasure, (2) a life of political activity and (3) a philosophical life.\n\nOne important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, \"arete\" (\"virtue\"). Aristotle says that the eudaimon life is one of \"virtuous activity in accordance with reason\" [1097b22–1098a20]. And even Epicurus who argues that the eudaimon life is the life of pleasure maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue. So the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (areté is bound up with eudaimonia). However, they disagree on the way in which this is so. We shall consider the main theories in a moment, but first a warning about the proper translation of areté.\n\nAs already noted, the Greek word areté is usually translated into English as \"virtue\". One problem with this is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense, which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For a Greek, areté pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty. So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of ‘virtue' operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom, courage and compassion. The sense of virtue which areté connotes would include saying something like \"speed is a virtue in a horse\", or \"height is a virtue in a basketball player\". Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.) has its own set of virtues. The alternative translation \"excellence\" (or \"a desirable quality\") might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term. The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.\n\nPositive Psychology defines Eudaimonia as a self-discovery, perceived development of one's best potentials, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, intense involvement in activities, investment of significant effort, and enjoyment of activities as personally expressive, deep relationships.\n\nIn terms of its etymology, eudaimonia is an abstract noun derived from \"eu\" meaning \"well\" and \"daimon\" (daemon), which refers to a minor deity or a guardian spirit.\n\nEudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach. A literal view of eudaimonia means achieving a state of being similar to benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity. As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as 'happiness' although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed. Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any super-natural significance.\n\nIn his \"Nicomachean Ethics,\" (1095a15–22) Aristotle says that eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is significant that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘happiness is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is \"a very happy person\", we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life. We mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.\n\nEudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone's life: they concern a person's really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle's discussion: \"Nicomachean Ethics,\" book 1.10–1.11.)\n\nBecause of this discrepancy between the meaning of eudaimonia and happiness, some alternative translations have been proposed. W.D. Ross suggests \"well-being\" and John Cooper proposes \"flourishing\". These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by \"happiness\" although each tends to raise some problems of its own. In some modern texts therefore, the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek, as \"eudaimonia\".\n\nWhat we know of Socrates' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's writings. Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the \"Phaedo\" and the \"Republic.\" This division will be employed here in dividing up the positions of Socrates and Plato on eudaimonia.\n\nAs with all other ancient ethical thinkers, Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else. (see Plato, \"Apology\" 30b, \"Euthydemus\" 280d–282d, \"Meno\" 87d–89a). However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control, courage, justice, piety, wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy (eudaimon) life. Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia. For example, in the \"Meno\", with respect to wisdom, he says: \"everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness\" [\"Meno\" 88c].\n\nIn the \"Apology,\" Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.\n\nGood Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul [29e].\n\n... it does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for \"virtue\". [31a–b; italics added]\n\nIt emerges a bit further on that this concern for one's soul, that one's soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue. So Socrates' point that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches. Virtues are states of the soul. When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected it possesses the virtues. Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good. The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than (e.g.) wealth and political power. Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the \"Crito\", where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:\n\nAnd is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body? Not at all. It is much more valuable…? Much more… (47e–48a)\n\nHere Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing. In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.\n\nPlato's great work of the middle period, the \"Republic\", is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist Thrasymachus, that conventional morality, particularly the 'virtue' of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia. Thrasymachus's views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the \"Gorgias\", through the mouthpiece of Callicles. The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires. This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the \"Republic\" when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus' challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges. According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment. When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne. The thrust of Glaucon's challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim. But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality. (This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of Nietzsche.) Throughout the rest of the \"Republic\", Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the virtue of justice is necessary for eudaimonia.\nThe argument of the \"Republic\" is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person's benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man's soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato's ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato's version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.\n\nAristotle's account is articulated in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and the \"Eudemian Ethics\". In outline, for Aristotle, eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (\"aretē\" sometimes translated as excellence) in accordance with reason. This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle's essentialist understanding of human nature, the view that reason (\"logos\" sometimes translated as rationality) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (\"ergon\") of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason. Basically, well being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one's highest and most human capabilities and human beings are \"the rational animal\". It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (\"areté\") in reason.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires activity, action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition. Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity. Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby. Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions. For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills, one might say \"doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist\". From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason [1097b22–1098a20]. Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success. The rest of the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason. Since reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.\n\nAristotle's ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. However, it is Aristotle's explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia. While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other ‘goods' such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic. He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as ‘good birth, good children, and beauty'. So, a person who is hideously ugly or has \"lost children or good friends through death\" (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon. In this way, \"dumb luck\" (chance) can preempt one's attainment of eudaimonia.\n\nEpicurus' ethical theory is hedonistic. (His view proved very influential on the founders and best proponents of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.) Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad. An object, experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is. Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value. An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money. Someone asks them \"why do you want the money?\", and they answer: \"So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean, and a red sports car.\" This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it – in this case, the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities.\n\nEpicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure. He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and, also, freedom from pain and distress. But it is important to notice that Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure. Rather, he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized \"in the long run\". In other words, Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains, and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures. The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.\n\nAncient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual's well being. Epicurus' doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue. He believes that we do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure. Epicurus' basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life which generates the most amount of pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous. This thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a tautology as \"eudaimonia is the good life\" would be: rather, it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in.\n\nOne important difference between Epicurus' eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness. To this difference, consider Aristotle's theory. Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree). He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason. The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., \"Nicomachean Ethics\" 1099a5). However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure. Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous. Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia. Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we aren't particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason. Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.\nBy contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness. His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon. Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness. So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure, Epicurus would endorse this claim.\n\nStoic philosophy begins with Zeno of Citium c.300 BC, and was developed by Cleanthes (331–232 BC) and Chrysippus (c.280–c.206 BC) into a formidable systematic unity. Zeno believed happiness was a \"good flow of life\"; Cleanthes suggested it was \"living in agreement with nature\", and Chrysippus believed it was \"living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature\". Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato's earlier dialogues.) We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by \"virtue\", which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).\n\nThe Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely \"neutral\". The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to Cynic philosophers such as Antisthenes and Diogenes in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one's family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of Immanuel Kant, who argues that the possession of a \"good will\" is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant's position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.\n\nInterest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally enjoyed a revival in the twentieth century. G. E. M. Anscombe in her article \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" (1958) argued that duty-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a \"law without a lawgiver\". She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the Ten Commandments depends on someone having made these rules. Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.\n\nJulia Driver in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" explains:\n\nAnscombe's article \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as \"morally ought\", \"morally obligated\", \"morally right\", and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of moral authority. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.\n\nModels of eudaimonia in psychology emerged from early work on self-actualization and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as Erik Erikson, Gordon Allport, and Abraham Maslow. \n\nCentral theories are Diener's tripartite model of subjective well-being, Ryff's Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being, Keyes work on flourishing, and Seligman's contributions to positive psychology and his theories on \"authentic happiness\" and P.E.R.M.A. Related concepts are happiness, flourishing, quality of life, contentment, and meaningful life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "189951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189951", "title": "Force carrier", "text": "Force carrier\n\nIn particle physics, force carriers or messenger particles or intermediate particles are particles that give rise to forces between other particles. These particles are bundles of energy (quanta) of a particular kind of field. There is one kind of field for every type of elementary particle. For instance, there is an electric field whose quanta are electrons, and an electromagnetic field whose quanta are photons. The force carrier particles that mediate the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions are called gauge bosons.\n\nIn particle physics, quantum field theories such as the Standard Model describe nature in terms of fields. Each field has a complementary description as the set of particles of a particular type. A force between two particles can be described either as the action of a force field generated by one particle on the other, or in terms of the exchange of virtual force carrier particles between them.\n\nThe energy of a wave in a field (for example, electromagnetic waves in the electromagnetic field) is quantized, and the quantum excitations of the field can be interpreted as particles. The Standard Model contains the following particles, each of which is an excitation of a particular field:\nIn addition, composite particles such as mesons can be described as excitations of an effective field.\n\nGravity is not a part of the Standard Model, but it is thought that there may be particles called gravitons which are the excitations of gravitational waves. The status of this particle is still tentative, because the theory is incomplete and because the interactions of \"single\" gravitons may be too weak to be detected.\n\nWhen one particle scatters off another, altering its trajectory, there are two ways to think about the process. In the field picture, we imagine that the field generated by one particle caused a force on the other. Alternatively, we can imagine one particle emitting a virtual particle which is absorbed by the other. The virtual particle transfers momentum from one particle to the other. This particle viewpoint is especially helpful when there are a large number of complicated quantum corrections to the calculation since these corrections can be visualized as Feynman diagrams containing additional virtual particles.\n\nThe description of forces in terms of virtual particles is limited by the applicability of the perturbation theory from which it is derived. In certain situations, such as low-energy QCD and the description of bound states, perturbation theory breaks down.\n\n\nThe concept of messenger particles dates back to the 18th century when the French physicist Charles Coulomb showed that the electrostatic force between electrically charged objects follows a law similar to Newton's Law of Gravitation. In time, this relationship became known as Coulomb's law. By 1862, Hermann von Helmholtz had described a ray of light as the \"quickest of all the messengers\". In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the existence of a light-particle in answer to the question: \"what are light quanta?\" \n\nIn 1923, at the Washington University in St. Louis, Arthur Holly Compton demonstrated an effect now known as Compton scattering. This effect is only explainable if light can behave as a stream of particles and it convinced the physics community of the existence of Einstein's light-particle. Lastly, in 1926, one year before the theory of quantum mechanics was published, Gilbert N. Lewis introduced the term \"photon\", which soon became the name for Einstein’s light particle. From there, the concept of messenger particles developed further.\n\n"}

Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding in North America, although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes.\n\nThe original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter, flour, cereal, eggs, and/or suet, resulting in a solid mass. These puddings are baked, steamed, or boiled. Depending on its ingredients, such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert.\n\nSteamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savory and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding.\n\nThe second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie. These puddings are easily scorched on the fire, which is why a double boiler is often used; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring.\n\nCreamy puddings are typically served chilled, but a few, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm. Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly.\n\nThis pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange.\nTable cream is a dessert, similar to blancmange. The dessert was popularized by English manufacturer Symington's Ltd in the early 20th century. It is still produced under the Symington's brand name, but no longer made by the original company.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "192176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192176", "title": "Shura", "text": "Shura\n\nShura ( \"shūrā\") is an Arabic word for \"consultation\". The Quran and the Prophet Muhammad encourage Muslims to decide their affairs in consultation with those who will be affected by that decision.\n\nShura is mentioned as a praiseworthy activity often used in organizing the affairs of a mosque, Islamic organizations, and is a common term involved in naming parliaments.\n\nSunni Muslims believe that Islam requires all decisions made by and for the Muslim societies to be made by shura of the Muslim community and believe this to be the basis for implementing representative democracy. Traditionally however, the Amir/Sultan/Khalifa would consult with his Wazirs (Advisors) and make a decision, after taking into consideration their opinions.\n\nShia Muslims say that Islam requires submission to existing rulers if they are correctly appointed, so long as they govern according to Sharia or Islamic law. This is a more traditional approach, characteristic of many centuries of Islamic history (see History of Islam).\n\nThe difference between the two appears more semantic than actual—the latter accept that the rulers must be accounted in all aspects of ruling, to ensure affairs are managed in the best possible way whether decisions were taken through consultation or not.\n\n\"Those who hearken to their Lord, and establish regular Prayer; who (conduct) their affairs by mutual consultation among themselves; who spend out of what We bestow on them for Sustenance\" [are praised] \n\n Thus it is due to mercy from God that you deal with them gently, and had you been rough, hard hearted, they would certainly have dispersed from around you; pardon them therefore and ask pardon for them, and take counsel with them in the affair; so when you have decided, then place your trust in God; surely God loves those who trust. \nThe first verse only deals with family matters. The second proposed a lifestyle of people who will enter heavens and is considered the most comprehensive verse on shura. The third verse advises on how mercy, forgiveness and mutual consultation can win over people.\n\nMuhammad made all his decisions in consultation with his followers unless it was a matter in which God has ordained something. It was common among Muhammad's companions to ask him if a certain advice was from God or from him. If it was from Muhammad, they felt free to give their opinion. Some times Muhammad changed his opinion on the advice of his followers like his decision to defend the city of Madinah by going out of the city in Uhad instead of from within the city.\n\nArguments over shura began with the debate over the ruler in the Islamic world. When Muhammad died in 632 CE, a tumultuous meeting at Saqifah selected Abu Bakr as his successor. This meeting did not include some of those with a strong interest in the matter—especially Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law; people who wanted Ali to be the caliph (ruler) (later known as Shia ) still consider Abu Bakr an illegitimate leader of the caliphate.\n\nIn later years, the followers of Ali (Shi'atu Ali) as the ruler of Muslims became one school of thought, while the followers of Abu Bakr became the Sunni school of thought.\n\nThe Sunni school of thought believe that shura is recommended in the Qur'an (though some classical jurists maintained it is obligatory), The Qur'an, and by numerous hadith, or oral traditions of the sayings and doings of Muhammad and his companions. They say that most of the first four caliphs, or rulers of Islam, whom they call the Four Rightly-guided Caliphs, were chosen by shura. (See Succession to Muhammad, Umar ibn al-Khattab, The election of Uthman, and Ali Ibn Abi Talib.)\n\nThe Shi'a school of thought believe that Muhammad had clearly indicated that Ali was his appointed infallible ruler of Muslim nation regardless of shura, a recommendation that was ignored by the first three caliphs. Shi'a do not stress the role of shura in choosing leaders, but believe that the divine vice-regent is chosen by God, or Allah, from the lineage of Muhammad (Ahl al-Bayt). The largest Shi'a sect believes that the current imam is in \"occultation\", hidden away until the last days, but there are minority Shi'a who follow leaders believed to be infallible imams.\n\nDuring and after Imam Ali's tenure as caliph, the Muslim community fell into civil war. Power was eventually grasped by the Ummayad caliphs and then by the Abbasid caliphs. There were also rival caliphates in Egypt and Al-Andalus, the latter of which is today known as Spain. Later the rulers of the Ottoman Empire inherited the caliphate. The Ottoman Caliphate was officially dissolved by the newly founded Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1924.\n\nFew of the later caliphs had anything but nominal control over the many Islamic states, and none were chosen by shura; all reached power by inheritance. The Muslim clergy counseled submission to rulers but also stressed the duty of the ruler to rule by shura. They based this recommendation on the passages from the Qur'an mentioned above. The verses indicate that shura is praiseworthy but do not indicate who should be consulted, what they should be consulted about, or whether the ruler or the shura should prevail in the event the two do not agree.\n\nIn some Muslim nations, shuras play a role in the constitution or governance. Some Muslim nations, such as Turkey, are secular republics, and Morocco is a constitutional monarchy. They could thus be said to be ruled by one version of shura. For instance, the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan is officially called the Majlis-i-Shura, although the Constitution uses various spellings of the term. In Egypt, the Upper House of Parliament is known as the Shura Council. The People's Consultative Assembly in Indonesia is called \"Majlis Permusyawaratan Rakyat\" in Indonesian language. The word \"musyawarat\" is derived from shura/syawara.\n\nIn some monarchies and clerical regimes, there is a shura with an advisory or consultative role. Saudi Arabia, a monarchy, was given a shura council, the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia, in 1993; there are now 150 members. All real power is held by the King, who is elected by family members. Oman, also a monarchy has a shura council; all members are elected except the president, who is appointed by the Sultan. The council can only offer advice, which may be refused if vetoed by the Sultan.\n\nIn Iran, a council called the assembly of experts has the ability to impeach the supreme leader. In addition to that, a general shura wields legislative powers, equivalent to a modern-day Western parliament.\n\nShuras have also been a feature of revolutions in Islamic societies, such as in the Iranian revolution of 1979, where they were formed by workers and held considerable power over parts of the economy for a year before being dismantled. Shuras were similarly a feature of the uprisings in Iraq in 1991, where they functioned as a form of participatory democracy.\n\nMany traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that to be in keeping with Islam, a government should have some form of council of consultation or \"majlis al-shura\", although it must recognize that God and not the people are sovereign. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said that in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, and then the majlis should select a caliph from the list of candidates.\n\nMany contemporary Muslims have compared the concept of Shura to the principles of western parliamentary democracy. For example: \nWhat is the shura principle in Islam? ... It is predicated on three basic precepts. First, that all persons in any given society are equal in human and civil rights. Second, that public issues are best decided by majority view. And third, that the three other principles of justice, equality and human dignity, which constitute Islam's moral core, ... are best realized, in personal as well as public life, under shura governance.\n\nOther modern Muslim thinkers distance themselves from democracy. Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, the founder of the modern transnational Islamist party Hizb ut-Tahrir, writes that shura is important and part of \"the ruling structure\" of the Islamic caliphate, \"but not one of its pillars.\" If the caliph \"neglects it,\" by not paying much or any attention, as happened after the first four caliphs, \"he would be negligent, but the ruling system would remain Islamic.\"\n\nThis is because the shura (consultation) in Islam is for seeking the opinion and not for ruling. This is contrary to the parliamentary system in democracy.\nThe democratic parliamentary system being distinct from and inferior to the true Islamic caliphate system according to Taqiuddin an-Nabhani.\n\nUnder the Hizb ut-Tahrir constitution, non-Muslims may not serve a caliph or any other ruling official, nor vote for these officials, but may be part of the majlis and voice \"complaints in respect to unjust acts performed by the rulers or the misapplication of Islam upon them.\"\n\nStill others, such as the Muslim author Sayyid Qutb, go further, arguing that an Islamic shura should advise the caliph but not elect or supervise him. In a rigorous analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb noted that Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute. In 1950 Qutb denounced democracy in favor of dictatorship, saying it was already bankrupt in the West and asking why it should be imported to the Middle East.\n\nThe practice of a consultative, but not bill-passing, caliph-electing or popularly elected shura, was adopted by the self-described strict Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. While the Kandahar Shura of the Taliban debated issues, in the end its spokesman declared, \"we abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view.\" \n\nIn Persian language and Dari in Afghanistan, the term \"شوروی\", \"shuravi\" is used for 'Soviet' (the etymology being related to \"council\"). In Tajik language it is written \"Шӯравӣ\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "192368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192368", "title": "Hot dog", "text": "Hot dog\n\nThe hot dog or dog (also spelled hotdog) is a grilled or steamed link-sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced hot dog bun, a bun of size and shape to hold the sausage. It can also refer to the sausage (the \"wurst\" or \"wörst\") of its composition itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches. Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, and relish, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, chili, cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.\n\nThese types of sausages and their sandwiches were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States, where the \"hot dog\" became a working-class street food sold at hot dog stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines, including notably Chicago street cuisine.\n\nClaims about the invention of the hot dog are difficult to assess, as different stories assert different origins for the distinction between hot dogs and other similar foods. The history of the dish may begin with the creation of the sausage, with the placing of the sausage on bread or a bun as finger food, with the popularization of the existing dish, or with the application of the name \"hot dog\" to a sausage and bun combination most commonly used with ketchup or mustard and sometimes relish.\n\nThe word \"frankfurter\" comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated. These sausages, \"Frankfurter Würstchen\", were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor as King. \"Wiener\" refers to Vienna, Austria, whose German name is \"Wien\", home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef. Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city of Coburg, is said to have brought the \"Frankfurter Würstchen\" to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it \"Frankfurter\". Nowadays, in German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called \"Wiener\" or \"Wiener Würstchen\" (\"Würstchen\" means \"little sausage\"), in differentiation to the original pork-only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called \"Wienerli\", while in Austria the terms \"Frankfurter\" or \"Frankfurter Würstel\" are used.\n\nAnother possible origin for serving the sausages in rolls is the pieman Charles Feltman, at Coney Island in New York City. In 1867 he had a cart made with a stove on which to boil sausages, and a compartment to keep buns fresh in which they were served. In 1871 he leased land to build a permanent restaurant, and the business grew, selling far more than just the \"Coney Island Red Hots\" as they were known.\n\nIn 1916, a Polish American employee of Feltman's named Nathan Handwerker was encouraged by Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante, both working as waiters/musicians, to go into business in competition with his former employer.\nHandwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging ten.\n\nAt an earlier time in food regulation, when the hot dog was suspect, Handwerker made sure that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at Nathan's Famous to reassure potential customers.\n\nThe term \"dog\" has been used as a synonym for sausage since the 1800s, with one thought being that it came from accusations that sausage makers used dog meat, starting in at least 1845. In the early 20th century, consumption of dog meat in Germany was common. The suspicion that sausages contained dog meat was \"occasionally justified\".\n\nAn early use of \"hot dog\" in reference to sausage-meat appears in the \"Evansville\" (Indiana) \"Daily Courier\" (September 14, 1884): \"even the innocent 'wienerworst' man will be barred from dispensing hot dog on the street corner\". It was used to mean a sausage in casing in the \"Paterson\" (New Jersey) \"Daily Press\" (31 December 1892): \"the 'hot dog' was quickly inserted in a gash in a roll\". Subsequent uses include the \"New Brunswick \"(New Jersey)\" Daily Times\" (May 20, 1893), the \"New York World\" (May 26, 1893), and the \"Knoxville \"(Tennessee)\" Journal\" (September 28, 1893).\n\nAccording to a myth, the use of the complete phrase \"hot dog\" in reference to sausage was coined by the newspaper cartoonist Thomas Aloysius \"Tad\" Dorgan around 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a New York Giants baseball game at the Polo Grounds. However, Dorgan's earliest usage of \"hot dog\" was not in reference to a baseball game at the Polo Grounds, but to a bicycle race at Madison Square Garden, in \"The New York Evening Journal\" December 12, 1906, by which time the term \"hot dog\" in reference to sausage was already in use. In addition, no copy of the apocryphal cartoon has ever been found.\n\nCommon hot dog sausage ingredients include:\n\nPork and beef are the traditional meats used in hot dogs. Less expensive hot dogs are often made from chicken or turkey, using low-cost mechanically separated poultry. Typical hot dogs contain sodium, saturated fat and , which when consumed in excess have been linked to health problems. Changes in meat technology and dietary preferences have led manufacturers to use turkey, chicken, vegetarian meat substitutes, and to lower the salt content.\n\nHot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are \"skinless\" rather than \"natural casing\" sausages.\n\nAs with most sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing to be cooked. Traditional casing is made from the small intestines of sheep. The products are known as \"natural casing\" hot dogs or frankfurters. These hot dogs have firmer texture and a \"snap\" that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten.\n\nKosher casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted collagen casings.\n\n\"Skinless\" hot dogs must use a casing for cooking, but the casing may be a long tube of thin cellulose that is removed between cooking and packaging, a process invented in Chicago in 1925 by Erwin O. Freund, founder of Visking.\n\nThe first skinless hot dog casings were produced by Freund's new company under the name \"Nojax\", short for \"no jackets\" and sold to local Chicago sausage makers.\n\nSkinless hot dogs vary in surface texture, but have a softer \"bite\" than with natural casing. Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size and cheaper to make than natural casing hot dogs.\n\nA hot dog sausage is prepared and served in various ways. It is reheated for safety by any means (boiled, grilled, fried, steamed, broiled, baked, microwaved, toasted, etc). Typically it is served in a hot-dog bun with prepared mustard and optional other condiments. The sausage itself may be sliced and added, without bread, to other dishes.\n\nHot dogs are cooked during manufacture and can be eaten as bought, although they are usually warmed before serving.\n\nMost hot dogs are high in fat and salt and have preservatives sodium nitrate and nitrite, which are contributors to nitrate-containing chemicals classified as group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization, although this has been disputed. These health concerns have resulted in manufacturers offering alternative product lines made from turkey and chicken, and uncured, low-sodium, and \"all-natural\" franks.\nHot dogs have relatively low carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCA) levels compared to other types of ready-to-eat meat products, because they are manufactured at low temperatures.\n\nAn American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) report found that consuming one daily 50-gram serving of processed meat — about one hot dog — increases long-term risk of colorectal cancer by 20 percent. This is an increase due to eating a hot dog every day of 1.2 percentage points in the probability of contracting colorectal cancer, from 5.8 percent to 7 percent. The AICR's warning campaign has been criticised as \"attack ads\". The Cancer Project group filed a class-action lawsuit demanding warning labels on packages and at sporting events.\n\nLike many foods, hot dogs can cause illness if not heated properly to kill pathogens. An unopened package of franks contains ingredients that have the potential for promoting the growth of \"Listeria\" bacteria. \"Listeria monocytogenes\" can also cause serious infections in infants and pregnant women, and can be transmitted to an infant in utero or after birth. Adults with suppressed immune systems can also be harmed.\n\nDue to their size, shape, and ubiquitous consumption, hot dogs present a significant choking risk, especially for children. A study in the US found that 17% of food-related asphyxiations among children younger than 10 years of age were caused by hot dogs. The risk of choking on a hot dog sausage is eliminated by slicing it. It has been suggested that redesign of size, shape and texture would reduce the risk.\n\nIn the US, the term \"hot dog\" refers to both the sausage by itself and the combination of sausage and bun. Many nicknames applying to either have emerged over the years, including frankfurter, frank, wiener, weenie, coney, and red hot. Annually, Americans consume 20 billion hot dogs.\n\nHot dog stands and trucks sell hot dogs at street and highway locations. Wandering hot dog vendors sell their product in baseball parks. At convenience stores, hot dogs are kept heated on rotating grills. 7-Eleven sells the most grilled hot dogs in North America — 100 million annually. Hot dogs are also common on restaurants' children's menus.\n\nHot dogs are commonly served with one or more condiments. In 2005, the US-based National Hot Dog & Sausage Council (part of the American Meat Institute) found mustard to be the most popular, preferred by 32% of respondents; 23% favored ketchup; 17% chili con carne; 9% pickle relish, and 7% onions. Other toppings include sauerkraut, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.\n\nCondiment preferences vary across the U.S.. Southerners showed the strongest preference for chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup.\n\nAn endless list of hot dog variations has emerged. The original leader, known today as a \"New York dog\" or \"New York style\", is a natural-casing all-beef frank topped with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard, onions optional. Sauteed bell peppers, onions, and potatoes find their way into New Jersey's deep-fried Italian hot dog. In the midwest, the Chicago-style hot dog reigns, served on a poppyseed bun and topped with mustard, fresh tomatoes, onions, \"sport peppers\", bright green relish, dill pickles, and celery salt.\nMany variations are named after regions other than the one in which they are popular. Meaty Michigan hot dogs are popular in upstate New York (as are white hots), while beefy Coney Island hot dogs are popular in Michigan. Hot wieners, or weenies, are a staple in Rhode Island where they are sold at restaurants with the misleading name \"New York System.\" Texas hot dogs are spicy variants found in upstate New York and Pennsylvania (and as \"all the way dogs\" in New Jersey), but not Texas.\n\nSome baseball parks have signature hot dogs, such as Dodger Dogs at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and Fenway Franks at Fenway Park in Boston, which are boiled then grilled, and served on a New England-style bun.\n\nSkinner's Restaurant, in Lockport, Manitoba is reputed to be Canada's oldest hot dog outlet in continuous operation, founded in 1929, by Jim Skinner Sr. Hotdogs served at Skinners are European style footlongs with natural casings, manufactured by Winnipeg Old Country Sausage in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nThe Half Moon Drive In, also in Lockport, Manitoba and located directly across the river from Skinners, was established in 1938 by brothers Peter and Louie Kosowicz. The original drive-in consisted of three wooden buildings shaped like semicircles—one was for takeout, one was for dine-in, and the third was a dance hall and later an arcade. The Half Moon also serves European-style wieners manufactured by Winnipeg Old Country Sausage. One of the most popular items is the Moon Dog, consisting of cheese, bacon, fried onions, pickles and mustard, and the Half Moon serves about 2,000 on an average summer weekend day.\n\nIn most of the world, \"hot dog\" is recognized as a sausage in a bun, but the type varies considerably. The name is often applied to something that would not be described as a hot dog in North America. For example, in New Zealand a \"hot dog\" is a battered sausage, often on a stick, which is known as a corn dog in North America; an \"American hot dog\" is the version in a bun.\n\nThe world's longest hot dog created was , which rested within a bun. The hot dog was prepared by Shizuoka Meat Producers for the All-Japan Bread Association, which baked the bun and coordinated the event, including official measurement for the world record. The hot dog and bun were the center of a media event in celebration of the Association's 50th anniversary on August 4, 2006, at the Akasaka Prince Hotel, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, Guinness World Records certified the world record for most expensive hot dog at US$145.49. The \"California Capitol City Dawg\", served at Capitol Dawg in Sacramento, California, features a grilled all-beef in natural casing frank from Chicago, served on a fresh baked herb and oil focaccia roll, spread with white truffle butter, then grilled. It is topped with a whole grain mustard from France, garlic and herb mayonnaise, sauteed chopped shallots, organic mixed baby greens, maple syrup marinated/fruitwood smoked uncured bacon from New Hampshire, chopped tomato, expensive moose cheese from Sweden, sweetened dried cranberries, basil olive oil/pear-cranberry-coconut balsamic vinaigrette, and ground peppercorn. Proceeds from the sale of each super dog are donated to the Shriners Hospitals for Children.\n\n"}
{"id": "193276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193276", "title": "Margarine", "text": "Margarine\n\nMargarine () is a spread used for flavoring, baking, and cooking, that was first made in France in 1869. It was created by Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès in response to a challenge by Emperor Napoleon III to create a butter substitute from beef tallow for the armed forces and lower classes. First named \"oleomargarine\" from Latin for \"oleum\" (olive oil) and Greek for \"margarite\" (pearl indicating luster), it was later named \"margarine\".\n\nWhereas butter is made from the butterfat of milk, modern margarine is made mainly of refined vegetable oil and water, and may also contain milk. In some places in the United States, it is colloquially referred to as oleo, short for oleomargarine. In Britain it can be referred to colloquially as marge.\n\nMargarine, like butter, consists of a water-in-fat emulsion, with tiny droplets of water dispersed uniformly throughout a fat phase in a stable crystalline form. In some jurisdictions, margarine must have a minimum fat content of 80% to be labelled as such, the same as butter. Colloquially in the United States, the term margarine is used to describe \"non-dairy spreads\" with varying fat contents.\n\nDue to its versatility, margarine can be used as an ingredient in other food products, such as pastries, doughnuts, and cookies.\n\nMargarine originated with the discovery by French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul in 1813 of margaric acid (itself named after the pearly deposits of the fatty acid from Greek or μάργαρον (\"margaritēs\" / \"márgaron\"), meaning \"pearl-oyster\" or \"pearl\", or (\"margarís\"), meaning palm-tree, hence the relevance to palmitic acid). Scientists at the time regarded margaric acid, like oleic acid and stearic acid, as one of the three fatty acids that, in combination, form most animal fats. In 1853, the German structural chemist Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz analyzed margaric acid as simply a combination of stearic acid and the previously unknown palmitic acid.\n\nEmperor Napoleon III of France offered a prize to anyone who could make a satisfactory butter alternative, suitable for use by the armed forces and the lower classes. French chemist Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès invented a substance he called \"oleomargarine\", which became shortened to the trade name \"margarine\". Mège-Mouriès patented the concept in 1869 and expanded his initial manufacturing operation from France, but had little commercial success. In 1871, he sold the patent to the Dutch company Jurgens, now part of Unilever. In the same year a German pharmacist, Benedict Klein from Cologne, founded the first margarine factory \"Benedict Klein Margarinewerke\", producing the brands Overstolz and Botteram.\n\nJohn Steele wrote in his 1850 California gold miner's journal: \"I became acquainted with Mr. Daniels, from Baltimore, who... manufactured butter from tallow and lard, and it looked and tasted so much like real butter, that... I could not tell the difference. However, he deceived no one, but sold it for just what it was. He never explained the process of its manufacture, and whether he was the originator of oleomargarine I do not know.\" \n\nThe principal raw material in the original formulation of margarine was beef fat. In 1871, Henry W. Bradley of Binghamton, New York received for a process of creating margarine that combined vegetable oils (primarily cottonseed oil) with animal fats. By the late 19th century, some 37 companies were manufacturing margarine in opposition to the butter industry, which protested and lobbied for government intervention, eventually leading to the 1886 Margarine Act imposing punitive fees against margarine manufacturers.\n\nShortages in beef fat supply combined with advances by Boyce and Sabatier in the hydrogenation of plant materials soon accelerated the use of Bradley's method, and between 1900 and 1920 commercial oleomargarine was produced from a combination of animal fats and hardened and unhardened vegetable oils. The depression of the 1930s, followed by the rationing of World War II, led to a reduction in supply of animal fat and butter, and, by 1945, \"original\" margarine almost completely disappeared from the market. In the United States, problems with supply, coupled with changes in legislation, caused manufacturers to switch almost completely to vegetable oils and fats (oleomargarine) by 1950, and the industry was ready for an era of product development.\n\nWhile butter that cows produced had a slightly yellow color, margarine had a white color, making the margarine look more like lard, which many people found unappetizing. Around the late 1880s, the manufacturers began coloring the margarine yellow to improve sales.\n\nDairy firms, especially in Wisconsin, became alarmed and succeeded in getting legislation passed to prohibit the coloring of the stark white product. In response, the margarine companies distributed the margarine together with a packet of yellow food coloring. The product was placed in a bowl and the coloring mixed in manually. This took some time and effort, and it was not unusual for the final product to be served as a light and dark yellow, or even white, striped product. During World War II, there was a shortage of butter in the United States, and \"oleomargarine\" became popular. In 1951, the W.E. Dennison Company received for a method to place a capsule of yellow dye inside a plastic package of margarine. After purchase, the capsule was broken inside the package, and then the package was kneaded to distribute the dye. Around 1955, the artificial coloring laws were repealed, and margarine could for the first time be sold colored like butter.\n\nDuring WWII rationing, only two types of margarine were available in the UK, a premium brand and a cheaper budget brand. With the end of rationing in 1955, the market was opened to the forces of supply and demand, and brand marketing became prevalent. The competition between the major producers was given further impetus with the beginning of commercial television advertising in 1955 and, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, competing companies vied with each other to produce the margarine that tasted most like butter.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the introduction of two lower-fat blends of butter oil and vegetable oils in Scandinavia, called \"Lätt & Lagom\" and \"Bregott\", clouded the issue of what should be called \"margarine\" and began the debate that led to the introduction of the term \"spread\". In 1978, an 80% fat product called \"krona\", made by churning a blend of dairy cream and vegetable oils, was introduced in Europe and, in 1982, a blend of cream and vegetable oils called \"clover\" was introduced in the UK by the Milk Marketing Board. The vegetable oil and cream spread I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! was introduced into the United States in 1981, and in the United Kingdom and Canada in 1991.\n\nIn the 21st century, margarine spreads had many developments to improve their consumer appeal. Most brands phased out the use of hydrogenated oils and became trans fat free. Many brands launched refrigerator-stable margarine spreads that contain only 1/3 of the fat and calorie content of traditional spreads. Other varieties of spreads include those with added Omega-3 fatty acids, low or no salt, added plant sterols (claimed to reduce blood cholesterol), olive oil, or certified vegan oils. In the early 21st century, manufacturers provided margarines in plastic squeeze bottles to ease dispensing and offered pink margarine as a novelty.\n\nThe basic method of making margarine today consists of emulsifying a blend of vegetable oils and fats, which can be modified using fractionation, interesterification or hydrogenation, with skimmed milk, chilling the mixture to solidify it and working it to improve the texture. Vegetable and animal fats are similar compounds with different melting points. Those fats that are liquid at room temperature are generally known as oils. The melting points are related to the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds in the fatty acids components. A higher number of double bonds gives a lower melting point.\nCommonly, the natural oils are hydrogenated by passing hydrogen through the oil in the presence of a nickel catalyst, under controlled conditions. The addition of hydrogen to the unsaturated bonds (alkenic double C=C bonds) results in saturated C-C bonds, effectively increasing the melting point of the oil and thus \"hardening\" it. This is due to the increase in van der Waals' forces between the saturated molecules compared with the unsaturated molecules. However, as there are possible health benefits in limiting the amount of saturated fats in the human diet, the process is controlled so that only enough of the bonds are hydrogenated to give the required texture. Margarines made in this way are said to contain hydrogenated fat. This method is used today for some margarines although the process has been developed and sometimes other metal catalysts are used such as palladium. If hydrogenation is incomplete (partial hardening), the relatively high temperatures used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the carbon-carbon double bonds into the \"trans\" form. If these particular bonds are not hydrogenated during the process, they remain present in the final margarine in molecules of trans fats, the consumption of which has been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. For this reason, partially hardened fats are used less and less in the margarine industry. Some tropical oils, such as palm oil and coconut oil, are naturally semi-solid and do not require hydrogenation.\n\nModern margarines can be made from any of a wide variety of animal or vegetable fats, mixed with skim milk, salt, and emulsifiers. Margarines and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat. Depending on its final fat content and its purpose (spreading, cooking or baking), the level of water and the vegetable oils used vary slightly. The oil is pressed from seeds and refined. It is then blended with solid fat. If no solid fats are added to the vegetable oils, the latter undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The resulting blend is mixed with water, citric acid, carotenoids, vitamins and milk powder. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, and salt and preservatives are also commonly added. This oil-and-water emulsion is then heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub margarines are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block margarines.\n\nThree types of margarine are common:\n\nIn a 100-gram reference amount, margarine – manufactured from soybean oil and pasteurized – provides 628 calories and is composed of 70% fat, 2% carbohydrates, 26% water, and negligible protein (table). Margarine is rich in vitamin E (37% of the Daily Value, DV), containing 35 mg gamma-tocopherol) and sodium (47% DV) added as salt for flavor. Unless fortified with micronutrients during manufacturing, there are no other nutrients in significant content. Vitamin A and vitamin D may be added for fortification.\n\nThe roles of butter and traditional margarine (80% fat) are similar with respect to their energy content, but low-fat margarines and spreads are also widely available.\n\nReplacing saturated and trans unsaturated fats with unhydrogenated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is more effective in preventing coronary heart disease than reducing overall fat intake. See saturated fat and cardiovascular disease.\n\nVegetable fats can contain anything from 7% to 86% saturated fatty acids. Liquid oils (canola oil, sunflower oil) tend to be on the low end, while tropical oils (coconut oil, palm kernel oil) and fully hardened (hydrogenated) oils are at the high end of the scale. A margarine blend is a mixture of both types of components. Generally, firmer margarines contain more saturated fat.\n\nTypical soft tub margarine contains 10% to 20% of saturated fat. Regular butterfat contains 52 to 65% saturated fats. The American Institute of Medicine and the European Food Safety Authority recommend saturated fat intake to be as low as possible.\n\nConsumption of unsaturated fatty acids has been found to decrease LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels in the blood, thus reducing the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases.\n\nThere are two types of unsaturated oils: mono- and poly-unsaturated fats, both of which are recognized as beneficial to health in contrast to saturated fats. Some widely grown vegetable oils, such as rapeseed (and its variant canola), sunflower, safflower, and olive oils contain high amounts of unsaturated fats. During the manufacture of margarine, makers may convert some unsaturated fat into hydrogenated fats or trans fats to give them a higher melting point so they stay solid at room temperatures.\n\n\nUnlike essential fatty acids, trans fatty acids are not essential and provide no known benefit to human health besides providing calories. There is a positive linear trend between trans fatty acid intake and LDL cholesterol concentration, and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease, by raising levels of LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of HDL cholesterol.\n\nSeveral large studies have indicated a link between consumption of high amounts of trans fat and coronary heart disease, and possibly some other diseases, prompting a number of government health agencies across the world to recommend that the intake of trans fats be minimized.\n\nIn the United States, partial hydrogenation has been common as a result of preference for domestically produced oils. However, since the mid-1990s, many countries have started to move away from using partially hydrogenated oils. This led to the production of new margarine varieties that contain less or no trans fat.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration ordered that trans fat is to be eliminated from food processing after a three-year grace period beginning in June 2015, to then be implemented by June 18, 2018.\n\nHigh levels of cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein, are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and atheroma formation. The narrowing of blood vessels can cause reduced blood flow to the brain, heart, kidneys and other parts of the body. Cholesterol, though needed metabolically, is not essential in the diet, because the body's production increases as needed when dietary intake falls. The human body makes cholesterol in the liver, adapting the production according to its food intake, producing about 1 g of cholesterol each day or 80% of the needed total body cholesterol. The remaining 20% comes directly from food intake (in those who eat animal products).\n\nOverall intake of cholesterol as food has less effect on blood cholesterol levels than the type of fat eaten. Most margarines are vegetable-based and thus contain no cholesterol, while a teaspoon (5 grams) of butter contains 10.8 mg of cholesterol.\n\nPlant sterol esters or plant stanol esters have been added to some margarines and spreads because of their cholesterol-lowering effect. Several studies have indicated that consumption of about 2 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10%.\n\nMargarine, particularly polyunsaturated margarine, has become a major part of the Western diet and had overtaken butter in popularity in the mid-20th century. In the United States, for example, in 1930, the average person ate over of butter a year and just over of margarine. By the end of the 20th century, an average American ate around of butter and nearly of margarine.\n\nMargarine has a particular market value to those who observe the Jewish dietary laws of Kashrut, which forbids the mixing of meat and dairy products; hence there are strictly kosher non-dairy margarines available. These are often used by the kosher-observant consumer to adapt recipes that use meat and butter or in baked goods served with meat meals. The 2008 Passover margarine shortage in America caused much consternation within the kosher-observant community.\n\nRegular margarine contains trace amounts of animal products such as whey or dairy casein extracts. However, margarine that strictly does not contain animal products also exists. Such margarines provide a vegan substitute for butter.\n\nMargarine is common in Australian supermarkets. Sales of the product have decreased in recent years due to consumers \"reducing their use of spreads in their daily diet\". Butter-colored margarine was sold from its introduction in Australia, but dairy and associated industries lobbied governments strongly in a (vain) attempt to have them change its color, or banned altogether.\n\nAustralia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Standard 2.4.2 – Edible Oil Spreads requires that edible oil spreads and table margarine must contain no less than 55 μg/kg of vitamin D.\n\nCanadian standard B.09.016 states that margarine shall be:\n\n\"An emulsion of fat, or water in fat, oil, or fat and oil that are not derived from milk and shall contain not less than 80% fat and not less than 3300 IU of vitamin A and 530 IU of vitamin D.\"\n\nCalorie reduced margarine is specified in standard B.09.017 as:\n\n\"Containing not less than 40% fat and having 50% of the calories normally present in margarine.\"\nIn 2007, Health Canada released an updated version of the Canada's Food Guide that recommended Canadians choose \"soft\" margarine spreads that are low in saturated and trans fats and limit traditional \"hard\" margarines, butter, lard, and shortening in their diets.\n\nUnder European Union directives, margarine is defined as:\n\n\"A water-in-oil emulsion derived from vegetable/animal fats, with a fat content of at least 10% but less than 90%, that remain solid at a temperature of 20°C and are suitable as spread.\"\n\nMargarines may not have a milk fat content of more than 3%. For blends and blended spreads, the milk fat may be between 10% and 80%.\n\nSpread that contains 60 to 62% of fat may be called \"three-quarter-fat margarine\" or \"reduced-fat margarine\".\nSpread that contains 39 to 41% of fat may be called \"half-fat margarine\", \"low-fat margarine\", or \"light margarine\".\nSpreads with any other percentage of fat are called \"fat spread\" or \"light spread\".\n\nMany member states currently require the mandatory addition of vitamins A and D to margarine and fat spreads for reasons of public health. Voluntary fortification of margarine with vitamins had been practiced by manufacturers since 1925, but in 1940 with the advent of the war, certain governments took action to safeguard the nutritional status of their nations by making the addition of vitamin A and D compulsory. This mandatory fortification was justified in the view that margarine was being used to replace butter in the diet.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, no brands of spread on sale contain partially hydrogenated oils. Fortification with vitamins A and D is no longer mandatory for margarine, this brings it in line with other spreads wherein fortification is not required.\n\nSince margarine intrinsically appears white or almost white, by preventing the addition of artificial coloring agents, legislators found they could protect the dairy industries by discouraging the consumption of margarine based on visual appeal. If margarine were colored the same as butter, consumers would see it as being virtually the same thing as butter, and as a natural product. Bans on adding color became commonplace in the United States, Canada, and Denmark and, in some cases, those bans endured for almost 100 years. The rivalry between the dairy industry and the oleomargarine industry persists even today.\n\nIn Canada, margarine was prohibited from 1886 to 1948, though this ban was temporarily lifted from 1917 until 1923 due to dairy shortages. Nevertheless, bootleg margarine was produced in the neighboring Dominion of Newfoundland from whale, seal, and fish oil by the Newfoundland Butter Company and was smuggled to Canada where it was widely sold for half the price of butter. The Supreme Court of Canada lifted the margarine ban in 1948 in the Margarine Reference. That year, Newfoundland negotiated its entry into the Canadian Confederation, and one of its three non-negotiable conditions for union with Canada was a constitutional protection for the new province's right to manufacture margarine.\n\nIn 1950, as a result of a court ruling giving provinces the right to regulate the product, rules were implemented in much of Canada regarding margarine's color, requiring that it be bright yellow or orange in some provinces or colorless in others. By the 1980s, most provinces had lifted the restriction. However, in Ontario it was not legal to sell butter-colored margarine until 1995. Quebec, the last Canadian province to regulate margarine coloring, repealed its law requiring margarine to be colorless in July 2008.\n\nIn 1877, New York became the first U.S. state to attempt legal restriction of the sale of oleomargarine through compulsory labeling. The law, \"to prevent deception in sales of butter,\" required retailers to provide customers with a slip of paper that identified the \"imitation\" product as margarine. This law proved ineffective, as it would have required an army of inspectors and chemists to enforce it. By the mid-1880s, the U.S. federal government had introduced a tax of two cents per pound, and manufacturers needed an expensive license to make or sell the product. The simple expedient of requiring oleo manufacturers to color their product distinctively was, however, left out of early federal legislation. But individual states began to require the clear labeling of margarine. The color bans, drafted by the butter lobby, began in the dairy states of New York and New Jersey. In several states, legislatures enacted laws to require margarine manufacturers to add pink colorings to make the product look unpalatable, despite the objections of the oleo manufacturers that butter dairies themselves added annatto to their product to imitate the yellow of mid-summer butter.\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, eight out of ten Americans could not buy yellow margarine, and those who could had to pay a hefty tax on it. Bootleg colored margarine became common, and manufacturers began to supply food-coloring capsules so the consumer could knead the yellow color into margarine before serving it. Nevertheless, the regulations and taxes had a significant effect: the 1902 restrictions on margarine color, for example, cut annual consumption in the United States from .\n\nWith the coming of World War I, margarine consumption increased enormously, even in countries away from the front, such as the United States. In the countries closest to the fighting, dairy products became almost unobtainable and were strictly rationed. The United Kingdom, for example, depended on imported butter from Australia and New Zealand, and the risk of submarine attacks meant little arrived.\n\nThe long-running battle between the margarine and dairy lobbies continued: in the United States, the Great Depression brought a renewed wave of pro-dairy legislation; the Second World War, a swing back to margarine. Post-war, the margarine lobby gained power and, little by little, the main margarine restrictions were lifted, the most recent states to do so being Minnesota in 1963 and Wisconsin in 1967. Lois Dowdle Cobb (1889–1987) of Atlanta, wife of the agricultural publisher Cully Cobb, led the move in the United States to lift the restrictions on margarine. Some unenforced laws remain on the books.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "193310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193310", "title": "Oatmeal", "text": "Oatmeal\n\nOatmeal is a type of coarse flour made of hulled oat grains – groats – that have either been milled (ground), steel-cut, or rolled. Ground oats are also called \"white oats\". Steel-cut oats are known as \"coarse oatmeal\" or \"Irish oatmeal\" or \"pinhead oats\". Rolled oats can be either \"thick\" or \"thin\", and may be \"old-fashioned\", or \"quick\", or \"instant\". The term \"oatmeal\" is also used in the U.S. and parts of Canada as another word for an oat-based porridge popular in such countries made from either ground, steel-cut, or rolled oats.\n\nThe oat grains are dehusked by impact, then heated and cooled to stabilize the oat groats – the seed inside the husk. The process of heating produces a nutty flavour in the oats. These oat groats may be milled to produce fine, medium or coarse oatmeal. Steel-cut oats may be small and contain broken groats from the dehusking process (these bits may be steamed and flattened to produce \"smaller\" rolled oats).\n\nRolled oats are steamed and flattened whole oat groats. \"Old-fashioned oats\" can be thick and take a while to boil to make porridge. Quick-cooking rolled oats (\"quick oats\") are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. \"Instant oatmeal\" is precooked and dried, often with a sweetener, such as sugar, and flavourings added.\n\nBoth types of rolled oats may be eaten uncooked, as in muesli, or may be cooked with water or milk to make porridge. In some countries, rolled oats are eaten raw or toasted with milk and sugar, sometimes with raisins added, like a basic muesli. The term \"oatmeal\" sometimes refers to a porridge made from the bran or fibrous husk as well as the oat kernel or groat. Rolled oats are often used as a key ingredient in granola breakfast cereals (in which toasted oats are blended with sugar and/or nuts and raisins) and granola bars.\n\nRolled oats are also used as an ingredient in oatmeal cookies, oatcakes, British flapjack bars and baked oatmeal dessert dishes such as Apple Brown Betty and apple crisp. Oats may also be added to foods as an accent, as in the topping on many oat bran breads and as the coating on Caboc cheese. Oatmeal is also used as a thickening agent in thick, savoury Arabic or Egyptian meat-and-vegetable soups, and sometimes as a way of adding relatively low-cost fibre and nutritional content to meatloaf.\n\nUnenriched oatmeal, cooked by boiling or microwave, is 84% water, and contains 12% carbohydrates, including 2% dietary fiber, and 2% each of protein and fat (table). In a 100 gram amount, cooked oatmeal provides 71 Calories and contains 29% of the Daily Value (DV) for manganese and moderate content of phosphorus and zinc (11% DV each), with no other micronutrients in significant content (see table on right).\n\nOatmeal and other oat products were the subject of a 1997 ruling by the Food and Drug Administration that consuming oat bran or whole rolled oats can lower the risk of heart disease when combined with a low-fat diet via the effect of oat beta-glucan to reduce levels of blood cholesterol. A similar conclusion was reached in 2010 by the European Food Safety Authority.\n\nIn the United States oatmeal is often served as a porridge with milk or cream and a sweetener, such as brown sugar or honey. It may include additional ingredients such as peanut butter, cinnamon, or various types of fruits.\n\nOatmeal has a long history in Scottish culinary tradition because oats are better suited than wheat to the country's low temperatures and high humidity. As a result, oats became the staple grain of Scotland. The ancient universities of Scotland had a holiday called Meal Monday to permit students to return to their farms and collect more oats for food.\n\nSamuel Johnson referred, disparagingly, to this in his dictionary definition for oats: \"A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.\" His biographer, James Boswell, noted that Lord Elibank was said by Sir Walter Scott to have retorted, \"Yes, and where else will you see such horses and such men?\"\n\nA common method of cooking oatmeal in Scotland is to soak it overnight in salted water and cook on a low heat in the morning for a few minutes until the mixture thickens.\n\nIn Scotland, oatmeal is created by grinding oats into a coarse powder. It may be ground fine, medium, or coarse, or rolled, or the groats may be chopped in two or three pieces to make what is described as pinhead oatmeal. Ground oatmeal, rolled oats, and pinhead oatmeal, are all used (throughout Britain); one Scots manufacturer describes varieties as \"Scottish Porridge Oats\" (rolled), \"Scottish Oatmeal\" (medium ground), and \"Pinhead Oatmeal\". The main uses are:\n\n\nStaffordshire oatcakes are a local component of the full English breakfast. It is a plate-sized pancake, made with equal parts medium oatmeal and wheatmeal (flour), along with frothing yeast. Once the mixture has risen to produce something like a Yorkshire pudding batter, it is ladled onto a griddle or bakestone, and dried through. Staffordshire oatcakes are commonly paired with bacon, sausages, mushrooms, kidney, and baked beans, among others. A related oatcake is sometimes found in neighbouring Derbyshire.\n\nThroughout the Nordic and Baltic regions, oatmeal porridge made from rolled oats and water or milk is a traditional breakfast staple. Known under various local names meaning \"oat porridge\", \"oat flake porridge\" or \"oatmeal porridge\", it is normally made either salty or sweet by adding salt or sugar, and it is often eaten with added raisins or other dried fruits. Local names for the porridge include Swedish \"havregrynsgröt\", Danish \"havregrød\", Norwegian \"havregrøt\" or \"havregrøt\", Icelandic \"hafragrautur\", Finnish \"kaurapuuro\", Estonian \"kaerahelbepuder\", Latvian \"auzu pārslu (putra)\", Lithuanian \"avižinių dribsnių košė\" and Polish \"owsianka.\"\n\nOatmeal porridge has a long tradition in these regions, but during the Middle Ages porridge made from rye or barley was even more common in at least some parts of the area.\n\n"}
{"id": "193379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193379", "title": "Ginger ale", "text": "Ginger ale\n\nGinger ale is a carbonated soft drink flavoured with ginger. It is consumed on its own or used as a mixer, often with spirit-based drinks. There are two main types of ginger ale. The golden style is credited to the Irish doctor, Thomas Joseph Cantrell. The dry style (also called the pale style), a paler drink with a much milder ginger flavour, was created by Canadian John McLaughlin.\n\nThomas Joseph Cantrell, an Irish apothecary and surgeon, claimed to have invented ginger ale in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and marketed it with local beverage manufacturer Grattan and Company. Grattan embossed the slogan \"The Original Makers of Ginger Ale\" on its bottles. This was the older style Golden ginger ale, dark coloured, generally sweet to taste, with a strong ginger spice flavour. Ginger ale is clear; ginger beer is often cloudy due to the residues of brewing, and has a stronger ginger taste.\n\nDry ginger ale is recognized as a Canadian creation by John J. McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavour extracts to add to the water in 1904. That year, he introduced \"Pale Dry Ginger Ale\", the bubbly libation that would be patented in 1907 as \"Canada Dry Ginger Ale\". An instant success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages. Dry ginger ale quickly surpassed golden ginger ale in popularity. Today, golden ginger ale is an uncommon, more regional drink exemplified by Vernors. By contrast, dry ginger ale is produced on a large scale internationally, and is a staple in supermarkets and bars, and on airlines.\n\nCommercial ginger ales commonly contains carbonated water, sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial or natural ginger-flavour. Ginger content is often listed on labels in a general \"natural aroma\" or \"natural flavoring\" statement, to preserve secrecy of the complex proprietary mix of spices, fruits and other flavours used; lemon, lime, and cane sugar are the most common ingredients. Pineapple and honey are also occasionally used.\n\nTraditional ginger ale is made from a microbial starter culture (yeast or ginger bug), sugar, fresh ginger root, other flavourings and water. Ginger bug can be derived from ginger beer plant containing Saccharomyces florentinus and Lactobacillus hilgardii or fresh ginger root containing Lactobacillus bacteria and wild yeast. The carbonation comes from the yeast fermentation as opposed to carbonating the finished product. Ethanol, as a byproduct of fermentation, will be present in the ginger ale but can be controlled by modifying fermentation time.\n\nTo make traditional ginger ale, yeast or ginger bug is added to the initial ginger preparation containing sugar and other flavourings. Sugar is added because ginger does not contain enough for the entire fermentation process (1.7g sugar/100g ginger). Like other fermented beverages, the sugar present in the preparation is fermented by the microorganism into ethanol and carbon dioxide. In yeast, the enzyme responsible for fermentation is known as zymase. Fermentation must be conducted in an air-tight container because contact with oxygen will cause the microorganisms to stop fermenting.\n\nTraditional ginger ale will contain carbon dioxide as a result of fermentation but most commercial ginger ales will carbonate the final product instead. First, the water is chilled to a low temperature to allow more carbon dioxide to be dissolved. Then, alkaline compounds such as sodium bicarbonate may be added to reduce acidity. Lastly, carbon dioxide is added and slightly over-pressurized to facilitate movement into storage and the filling machine.\n\nPreservation of commercial ginger ale is usually done by adding a solution of salicylic acid, which has bactericidal and antiseptic properties. Another method of preservation is to use steam heating.\n\nCanada Dry Ginger ale has an acidic pH of 2.82, due to the relatively high concentration of carbonic acid it contains. This preserves the product in that foods with pH below 4.6 do not support microorganism growth.\n\nGinger ale, as with other ginger products and other non-ginger-flavored carbonated beverages, is often recommended as a home remedy for indigestion and motion sickness. It is also used to soothe coughs and sore throats.\n\nGinger ale is usually acceptable for people on a clear liquid diet.\n\nGinger ale is generally high in sugar.\n\nIt is popular in mixed drinks, and punch, and it is sometimes used as a non-alcoholic substitute for champagne or beer, since the beverages resemble each other in appearance. Ginger ale can be mixed with many hard liquors, beers and wines. In Jamaica, a common way to consume ginger ale is mixed with Red Stripe beer; this is called a Shandy Gaff.\n\nGinger ale and ginger beer are similar beverages, however, there are clear differences during the process. Ginger beer originated in England in the 1800s while ginger ale was founded in Ireland approximately 50 years later before it was modernized in 1907 by John McLaughlin. Original ginger beer contains 11% alcohol, but modern ginger beer contains less than 0.5% alcohol while modern ginger ale has absolutely no alcohol content. Ginger beer is brewed with natural ginger, lemon juice, sugar and it is fermented with a ginger beer plant culture (mainly lactobacillus). The fermentation of the lactobacillus produces a cloudy appearance, stronger-tasting and spicier flavour compared to ginger ale.\n\nDry ginger ale is also sold with a mint flavouring added. Some mint ginger ale brands have an artificial green colour added, while others are clear. Canada Dry has introduced a line of ginger ale mixed with green tea and one mixed with lemonade. In selected Japanese vending machines, Canada Dry also offers hot ginger ale, which is the heated version of the original but still retains carbonation.\n\nVernors, Blenheim, A-Treat, Bull's Head, Chelmsford, Buffalo Rock, Sussex and Red Rock are brands of golden ginger ale. Canada Dry, Schweppes, and Seagram's are major brands of dry ginger ale.\n\nBrands available in North America include Canada Dry, Canfield's, Hansen Natural, Vernors, Seagram's, Schweppes, Sussex, Buffalo Rock, Boylan Bottling Company, Polar Beverages, Ale-8-One, Blenheim, Foxon Park, Fitz's, Sprecher, Market Basket/Chelmsford, Red Rock, Reed's Ginger Brew, Chek (River of Dreams), Shasta, and Sussex Golden Ginger Ale.\n\nVernors is a flavoured golden ginger ale aged for three years in oak barrels before bottling. It was the first U.S. soft drink, originating in 1866, although it was modelled on imported Irish ginger beers. In Detroit, Michigan, a drink made with vanilla ice cream and Vernors ginger ale is called a Boston cooler.\n\nBlenheim is a golden ginger ale made in South Carolina; unlike most other brands, it is available in several degrees of spiciness: Old #3 Hot, #5 Not as Hot, and #9 Diet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "193430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193430", "title": "Chutney", "text": "Chutney\n\nChutney is a sauce or a dry base for a sauce, originating from the Indian subcontinent, used with the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, that can include such forms as a spicy coconut dip, a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish or a dahi (yogurt), cucumber, and mint dip.\n\nAn offshoot that took root in Anglo-Indian cuisine is usually a tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar was added to the recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or else to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product that in western cuisine is often eaten with a hard cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.\n\nNowadays, the making of some pickles and chutneys in India has been passed over to commercial production, whereas at one time it was done entirely in people's homes. The disadvantage of commercial chutneys and those produced in western style with vinegar and large amounts of sugar is that the main aim of sugar and vinegar as preservatives is to make the product safe for long-term consumption. Regular consumption of these products (as distinct from the original Indian array of fresh relishes) can add to total sugar consumption being increased to unhealthy levels.\n\nThe word \"chutney\" is derived from the Hindi word \"\", meaning to lick. In India, \"chutney\" refers to fresh and pickled preparations indiscriminately. Several Indian languages use the word for fresh preparations only. A different word \"achār\" () applies to pickles that often contain oil and are rarely sweet.\n\nIn India, chutneys can be either made alongside pickles that are matured in the sun for up to two weeks and kept up to a year or, more commonly, are freshly made from fresh ingredients that can be kept a couple of days or a week in the refrigerator.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, \"thogayal\" or \"thuvayal\" (Tamil) are preparations similar to chutney but with a pasty consistency. In Andhra Pradesh it is also called \"roti pacchadi\". In Telangana the same are called \"tokku\".\n\nMedicinal plants that are believed to have a beneficial effect are sometimes made into chutneys, for example \"Pirandai Thuvayal\" or ridged gourd chutney (\"Peerkangai Thuvayal\" or \"beerakaaya tokku\"). Ridged gourd can be bought in Chinese and Indian shops in large towns in the west and, when dried, becomes a bath sponge known as a luffa or loofah.\n\nBitter gourd can also serve as a base for a chutney which is like a relish or, alternatively as a dried powder.\n\nOccasionally, chutneys that contrast in taste and colour can be served together—a favourite combination being a green mint and chili chutney with a contrasting sweet brown tamarind and date chutney.\n\nChutneys may be ground with a mortar and pestle or an \"ammikkal\" (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a particular order; the wet paste thus made is sautéed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric blenders or food processors can be used as labor-saving alternatives to stone grinding.\n\nAmerican and European-style chutneys are usually fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction, with added flavourings. These may include sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger. Western-style chutneys originated from Anglo-Indians at the time of the British Raj recreated Indian chutneys using English orchard fruits—sour cooking apples and rhubarb, for example. They would often contain dried fruit: raisins, currants, and sultanas.\n\nThey were a way to use a glut of fall fruit and preserving techniques were similar to sweet fruit preserves using approximately an equal weight of fruit and sugar, the vinegar and sugar acting as preservatives.\n\nSouth Indian chutney powders are made from roasted dried lentils to be sprinkled on idlis and dosas. Peanut chutneys can be made wet or as a dry powder.\n\nSpices commonly used in chutneys include fenugreek, coriander, cumin, and asafoetida (\"hing\"). Other prominent ingredients and combinations include cilantro, capsicum, mint (coriander and mint chutneys are often called हरा \"hara\" chutney, Hindi for \"green\"), Tamarind or \"Imli\" (often called \"meethi\" chutney, as मिठाई \"meethi\" in Hindi means \"sweet\"), sooth (or \"saunth\", made with dates and ginger), coconut, onion, prune, tomato, red chili, green chili, mango, lime (made from whole, unripe limes), garlic, coconut, peanut, dahi, green tomato, dhaniya pudina (cilantro and mint), peanut (\"shengdana\" chutney in Marathi), ginger, dahi (yogurt), red chili powder, tomato onion chutney, cilantro, mint coconut chutney, and apricot.\n\nMajor Grey's Chutney is a type of sweet and spicy chutney popular in the United States. The recipe was reportedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name (likely apocryphal) who presumably lived in Colonial India. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey's Chutney, in India, the UK and the US.\n\nSimilar in preparation and usage to a pickle, simple spiced chutneys can be dated to 500 BC. Originating in India, this method of preserving food was subsequently adopted by the Romans and later British empires, who then started exporting this to the colonies, Australia and North America.\n\nAs greater imports of foreign and varied foods increased into northern Europe, chutney fell out of favor. This combined with a greater ability to refrigerate fresh foods and an increasing amount of glasshouses meant chutney and pickle were relegated to military and colonial use. Chutney reappeared in India around the 1780s as a popular appetizer.\n\nDiego Álvarez Chanca brought back chili peppers from the Americas to Spain in 1493. He had sailed with Columbus. After discovering their medicinal properties, Chanca developed a chutney to administer them.\n\nIn the early 17th century, British colonization of the Indian subcontinent relied on preserved food stuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and marmalades. (Marmalades proved unpopular due to their sweetness. They were also rare due to a lack of available sugar.)\n\nBeginning in the 17th century, fruit chutneys were shipped to European countries such as England and France as luxury goods. These imitations were called \"mangoed\" fruits or vegetables, the word 'chutney' still being associated with the lower working classes.\n\nMajor Grey's Chutney is thought to have been developed by a British officer who had traveled to India. The formula was eventually sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s. In the 19th century, types of chutney like Major Grey's or Bengal Club created for Western tastes were shipped to Europe from Monya.\n\nGenerally these chutneys are fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction.\n\nThe tradition of chutney making spread through the English-speaking world, especially in the Caribbean and American South, where chutney is a popular condiment for ham, pork, and fish.\n\n\n\n"}

The adjective \"wyborowa\" (with the same meaning as \"choice\" when used as an adjective in English) was used in a favorable press article and then added after the word \"vodka\" resulting in the final name \"Wódka Wyborowa\".\n\nThe product remained popular domestically until 1873 when the export of the vodka was started to the European countries. In 1927, Wyborowa became the first vodka brand to be an international trademark. In the 1950s and 60s, Wyborowa conquered all major European countries - it constituted over 60% of the total volume of vodka exported to the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter the period of economic transition in the late 1980s and early 90s, the Poznań distillery, like many others in the country, got itself into serious trouble and was close to filing for bankruptcy protection. However, due to the large international popularity of its major product, the plant was bought by the French alcohol producer Pernod Ricard. \n\nUntil 2009, Wyborowa was presented in 29 international competitions bringing - together with \"Wyborowa Exquisite\" (formerly \"Single Estate\") in the Super Premium category - 29 medals including 22 gold. In addition, Wódka Wyborowa received the \"International High Quality Trophy\" at Monde Selection's World Quality Selections in 2012. \n\nIn 2017 Wyborowa introduced new series of products including Wyborowa od Mistrza and Dark - first black vodka.\n\nWyborowa is produced from rye grain, using a double-step distillation process. The rye is sent to small privately owned agricultural distilleries, where the rye is mashed and distilled once to produce \"raw spirit\". \nWhen the rye arrives at the agricultural distillery, it is ground and then cooked within a large vessel using heated water from the distillery's own source. The mixture is treated with enzymes that facilitate the hydrolysis of starch to glucose. Afterwards, it undergoes fermentation in stainless steel tanks. Once the fermentation has been completed, the resulting liquid is known as the ‘wash’ and has an alcoholic strength of between 7% and 11% ABV\nThe wash is distilled in a copper column still, yielding a spirit around 90% ABV. It takes 3 kg of rye to produce one litre of spirit. This \"raw spirit\" is then transferred to the rectification plant for further purification. \n\nThe raw spirit passes through three columns of a continuous still to remove impurities.\nBefore Wyborowa is bottled, the rectified spirit needs to be reduced to the bottling strength of 40% ABV by diluting it with water from a dedicated spring. Once diluted, the vodka is passed through natural cellulose plates and mesh filters to remove particulate matter. Filtered vodka is pumped to the bottling line, where 5,000 bottles of Wyborowa are filled per hour. \n\nThe unique bottle shape was designed by architect Frank Gehry.\nIn an analysis mandated by Swiss TV RTS in May 2014, the Eurofins Scientific group of laboratories reveals the presence of sugar cane or corn while Wyborowa's labeling mentions rye alcohol only.\n\n"}

Absolut is owned by French group Pernod Ricard; it bought Absolut for €5.63 billion in 2008 from the Swedish state. Absolut is one of the largest brands of spirits in the world (after Officer's Choice, Smirnoff, Bacardi) and is sold in 126 countries. Absolut Vodka is distilled from wheat grown in southern Sweden. \n\nAbsolut was established in 1879 by Lars Olsson Smith and is produced in Åhus, Sweden. Smith challenged the city of Stockholm's liquor marketing monopoly with his vodka. It was sold just outside the city border at a lower price than the monopoly's product. Smith even offered free boat rides to the distillery and \"Rent Brännvin\" made Smith a fortune.In 1917, the Swedish government monopolized the country's alcohol industry. Vodka was then sold nationwide under the name \"Absolut Rent Brännvin\". The name changed with intervals, Absolut Rent Brännvin. In 1979, the old name Absolut was picked up when the upper-price range ABSOLUT VODKA was introduced. \"Renat\" is still a euphemism for spirits in Sweden, and the name of another vodka product by Vin & Sprit.\nAbsolut Vodka was introduced to the global market in 1979. Since its launch, Absolut has grown to sell over 90 million litres of vodka annually by 2008. The vodka is made from winter wheat. Approximately 80,000 metric tonnes (2,900,000 bushels) of wheat are used annually to produce Absolut Vodka. Over one kilogramme of grain is used in every one-litre bottle.\n\nAbsolut Vodka is known for its long-running advertising campaign created by TBWA for the Absolut's U.S. importer, Carillon Importers, Ltd. The first of these ads, typical of the rest, was introduced in 1981 and featured a picture of the bottle with a halo over the cap above the slogan ABSOLUT PERFECTION. In 1983, Carillon's President/CEO Michel Roux approached the artist Andy Warhol, whom he paid $65,000 to create an advertisement for Absolut. Over the years, Carillon commissioned the work of well-known painters, graphic designers, fashion designers, as well as many up-and-coming artists.\nDuring the 2017 Corporate Art Awards Ceremony hosted by the President of the Italian Republic Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinal Palace , Absolut received by pptArt a special award “for their long-running collaboration with 550 artists on 850 projects to shape their corporate image and brand” .\n\nIn 2007, Absolut began its \"In An Absolut World\" campaign in which the company posted various, often fanciful scenarios of what the target audience might think would constitute a perfect, or \"Absolut\", reality. In 2008, an advertisement placed in Mexican publications and on Mexican billboards featured a map of the U.S. and Mexico with the boundaries between the two as they were prior to the 1836 Texas Revolution and the Mexican–American War. Media outlets reported on some American consumers' reactions at the advert's perceived insensitivity to immigration issues.\nAbsolut responded that the adverts were purely whimsical, with no political or nationalist agenda, but its critics were adamant. Absolut later issued a public apology and withdrew the advert.\n\nAbsolut Art Collection\n"}
{"id": "197383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197383", "title": "Dzogchen", "text": "Dzogchen\n\nDzogchen () or \"Great Perfection\", Sanskrit: अतियोग, is a tradition of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism aimed at discovering and continuing in the natural primordial state of being. It is a central teaching of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism and of Bon. In these traditions, Dzogchen is the highest and most definitive path of the nine vehicles to liberation.\n\n\"Dzogchen\" is composed of two terms:\n\nThe term initially referred to the \"highest perfection\" of deity visualisation, after the visualisation has been dissolved and one rests in the natural state of the innately luminous and pure mind. In the 10th and 11th century, \"Dzogchen\" emerged as a separate tantric vehicle in the Nyingma tradition, used synonymously with the Sanskrit term \"ati yoga\" (primordial yoga).\n\nAccording to van Schaik, in the 8th-century tantra \"Sarvabuddhasamāyoga\" \nAccording to the 14th Dalai Lama, the term \"dzogchen\" may be a rendering of the Sanskrit term \"mahāsandhi\".\n\nAccording to Anyen Rinpoche, the true meaning is that the student must take the entire path as an interconnected entity of equal importance. Dzogchen is perfect because it is an all-inclusive totality that leads to middle way realization, in avoiding the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. It classifies outer, inner and secret teachings, which are only separated by the cognitive construct of words and completely encompasses Tibetan Buddhist wisdom. It can be as easy as taking Bodhicitta as the method, and failing this is missing an essential element to accomplishment.\n\nAccording to the Nyingma tradition, the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra taught Dzogchen to the Buddha Vajrasattva, who transmitted it to the first human lineage holder, the Indian Garab Dorje (fl. 55 CE). According to tradition, the Dzogchen teachings were brought to Tibet by Padmasambhava in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. He was aided by two Indian masters, Vimalamitra and Vairocana. According to the Nyingma tradition, they transmitted the Dzogchen teachings in three distinct series, namely the Mind Series (\"sem-de\"), Space series (\"long-de\"), and Secret Instruction Series (\"men-ngak-de\"). According to tradition, these teachings were concealed shortly afterward, during the 9th century, when the Tibetan empire disintegrated. From the 10th century forward, innovations in the Nyingma tradition were largely introduced historically as revelations of these concealed scriptures, known as terma.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a terma containing the story of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. According to this terma, Dzogchen originated with the founder of the Bon tradition, Tonpa Shenrab, who lived 18,000 years ago, ruling the kingdom of Tazik, which supposedly lay west of Tibet. He transmitted these teachings to the region of Zhang-zhung, the far western part of the Tibetan cultural world. The earliest Bon literature only exists in Tibetan manuscripts, the earliest of which can be dated to the 11th century. The Bon tradition also has a threefold classification, namely \"Dzogchen\", \"A-tri\", and the \"Zhang-zhung Aural Lineage (\"zhang-zhung nyen-gyu\").\n\nThe written history of Tibet begins in the early 7th century, when the Tibetan kingdoms were united, and Tibet expanded throughout large parts of Central Asia. Songtsen Gampo (reign ca.617-649/50) conquered the kingdom of Zhangzhung in western Tibet, dominated Nepal, and threatened the Chinese dominance in strategically important areas of the Silk Road. He is also credited with the adoption of a writing system, the establishment of a legal code, and the introduction of Buddhism, though it probably only played a minor role. Tri Songdetsen (742-ca.797) adopted Buddhism, but also maintained the martial traditions of the Tibetan empire. The Tibetans controlled Dunhuang, a major Buddhist center, from the 780s until the mid-ninth century. Halfway through the 9th century the Tibetan empire collapsed. Royal patronage of Buddhism was lost, leading to a decline of Buddhism in Tibet, only to recover with the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century, known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.\n\nTraditionally, the early Dzogchen literature is categorized into three categories, which more or less reflect the historical development of Dzogchen:\n\nAccording to Sam van Schaik, who studies early Dzogchen manuscripts from the Dunhuang caves, the Dzogchen texts are influenced by earlier Mahayana sources such as the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra and Indian Buddhist Tantras with their teaching of emptiness and luminosity, which in Dzogchen texts are presented as 'ever-purity' (\"ka-dag\") and 'spontaneous presence' (\"lhun-grub\").\n\nSam van Schaik also notes that there is a discrepancy between the histories as presented by the traditions, and the picture that emerges from those manuscripts.\n\nThere is no record of Dzogchen as a separate tradition or vehicle prior to the 10th century, although the terms \"atiyoga\" (as a higher practice than Tantra) and \"dzogchen\" do appear in 8th and 9th century Indian tantric texts. There is also no independent attestation of the existence of any separate traditions or lineages under the name of \"Dzogchen\" outside of Tibet, and it may be a unique Tibetan teaching, drawing on multiple influences, including both native Tibetan non-Buddhist beliefs and Chinese and Indian Buddhist teachings.\n\nAccording to van Schaik, the term \"atiyoga\" first appeared in the 8th century, in an Indian tantra called \"Sarvabuddhasamāyoga\". In this text, \"Anuyoga\" is the stage of yogic bliss, while \"Atiyoga\" is the stage of the realization of the \"nature of reality.\" According to van Schaik, this fits with the three stages of deity yoga as described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen). \"Atiyoga\" here is not a vehicle, but a stage or aspect of yogic practice. In Tibetan sources, until the 10th century \"Atiyoga\" is characterized as a \"mode\" (\"tshul\") or a \"view\" (\"lta ba\"), which is to be applied within deity yoga.\n\nAccording to van Schaik, the concept of dzogchen, \"great perfection,\" first appeared as the culmination of the meditative practice of deity yoga around the 8th century. The term \"dzogchen\" was likely taken from the \"Guhyagarbhatantra\". This tantra describes, as other tantras, how in the creation stage one generates a visualisation of a deity and its mandala. This is followed by the completion stage, in which one dissolves the deity and the mandala into oneself, merging oneself with the deity. In the \"Guhyagarbhatantra\" and some other tantras, there follows a stage called \"rdzogs chen\", in which one rests in the natural state of the innately luminous and pure mind.\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen in terms of nonconceptuality, nonduality and the spontaneous presence of the enlightened state. Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show the first signs of a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, \"Anuyoga\" and \"Atiyoga\" are still regarded then as modes of \"Mahāyoga\" practice. Only in the 11th century came \"Atiyoga\" to be threatened as a separate vehicle, at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition. Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools. Van Schaik quotes Sakya Pandita as writing, in his \"Distinguishing the Three Vows\":\nMost of the early Dzogchen literature, which are claimed to be \"translations\", are original compositions from a much later date than the 8th century. According to Germano, the Dzogchen-tradition first appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints. They were codified into a canon of eighteen texts which were referred to as \"mind oriented\" (\"sems phyogs\"), and later became known as \"mind series\" (sems de\"). \n\nThe mind series reflect the teachings of early Dzogchen, which rejected all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion. One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (\"stong pa\"), luminous (\"'od gsal ba\"), and pure. According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras. Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric Mahayoga, with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries these texts, which represent the dominant form of the tradition in the 9th and 10th centuries, were gradually transformed into full-fledged tantras, culminating in the Kulayarāja Tantra (\"kun byed rgyal po\", \"The All-Creating King\"), in the last half of the 10th or the first half of the 11th century. According to Germano, this tantra was historically perhaps the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.\n\nEarly Dzogchen was completely transformed in the 11th century, with the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,known as the later dissemination of Buddhism. New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism, and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice. The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences through the process of Treasure revelation. Especially the \"yogini\" tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual and somatic practices. These influences are reflected in the rise of subtle body representations and practices, new pantheons of wrathful and erotic Buddhas, increasingly antinomium rhetorics, and a focus on death-motifs.\n\nThese influences were incorporated in several movements such as the \"Secret Cycle\" (\"gsang skor\"), \"Ultra Pith\" (\"yang tig\"), \"Brahmin's tradition\" (\"bram ze'i lugs\"), the \"Space Class Series,\" and especially the \"Instruction Class series\", which culminated in the \"Seminal Heart\" (\"snying thig\"), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century.\n\nThe \"Seminal Heart\" belongs to the \"Instruction series.\" The main texts of the instruction series are the so-called seventeen tantras and the two \"seminal heart\" collections, namely the \"bi ma snying thig\" (\"Vima Nyingthig\", \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\") and the \"mkha' 'gro snying thig\" (\"Khandro nyingthig\", \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\"). The \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\" is attributed to Vimalamitra, but was largely composed by their discoverers, in the 11th and 12th century. The \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\" was produced by Tsultrim Dorje (\"Tshul khrims rdo rje\")(1291-1315/17).\n\nThe Seminal Heart teachings became the dominant Dzogchen-teachings, but was also criticized by conservative strands within the Nyingma-school. The most important Nyingma of the 12th century, Nyangrel Nyingma Özer (\"Nyang ral nyi ma 'od zer\", 1136-1204\n) developed his \"Crown Pith\" (\"spyi ti\") to reassert the older traditions in a new form. His writings, which were also presented as revelations, are marked by a relative absence of \"yogini\" tantra influence, and transcend the prescriptions of specific practices, as well as the rhetoric of violence, sexuality and transgression.\n\nA pivotal figure in the history of Dzogchen was Longchenpa Rabjampa (1308-1364, possibly 1369). He systematized the Seminal Heart teachings and other collections of texts that were circulating at the time in Tibet, in the Seven Treasuries (\"mdzod bdun\"), the \"Trilogy of Natural Freedom\" (\"rang grol skor gsum\"), and the Trilogy of Natural Ease (\"ngal gso skor gsum\"). Longchenpa refined the terminology and interpretations, and integrated the Seminal Heart teachings with broader Mahayana literature.\n\nMalcolm Smith notes that Longchenpa's \"Tshig don mdzod,\" the \"Treasury of Subjects,\" was preceded by several other texts by other authors dealing with the same topics. Smith mentions the 12th century text \"The Eleven Subjects of The Great Perfection\" by Nyi 'bum. This itself was derived from the eighth and final chapter of the commentary to The String of Pearls Tantra.\n\nNyi 'bum's \"Eleven Subjects\" is the basis for Longchenpa's \"Treasury of Subjects\" as well as Rigzin Godem's \"The Aural Lineage of Vimalamitra\" from the Gongpa Zangthal.\n\nAccording to Smith, Nyi 'bum's \"Eleven Subjects\" provided the outline upon which Longchenpa's \"Treasury of Subjects\" was based, using the general sequence of citations, and even copying or reworking entire passages. According to Smith, Nyi 'bum's \"Eleven Subjects\" was transmitted in a close circle of disciples, with very little outside contact, whereas Longchenpa's \"Treasury of Subjects\" contains responses to 14th century scholastic objections to Dzogchen.\n\nIn subsequent centuries more additions followed, including the \"Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones\" (\"kar-gling zhi-khro\") by Karma Lingpa, (1326–1386), popularly known as \"Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones\", which includes the two texts of the \"bar-do thos-grol\", the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\".\n\nOther important termas are \"The Penetrating Wisdom\" (\"dgongs pa zang thal\"), revealed by Rinzin Gödem (\"rig 'dzin rgod ldem\", 1337-1409); and \"The Nucleus of Ati's Profound Meaning\" (\"rDzogs pa chen po a ti zab don snying po\") by Terdak Lingpa (\"gter bdag gling pa\", 1646-1714).\n\nParticularly influential of these later revelations are the works of Jigme Lingpa (1730–1798). His Longchen Nyingthig (\"klong chen snying thig\"), \"The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse\" or \"The Seminal Heart of the Great Matrix\", is a hidden teaching from Padmasambhava which was revealed by Jigme Lingpa. The Longchen Nyingthig is said to be the essence of the \"Vima Nyingthig\" and \"Khandro Nyingthig\", the \"Early Nyingthig,\", and has become known as the \"later Nyingthig\". It is one of the most widely practiced teachings in the Nyingmapa school. Patrul Rinpoche (1808–1887) wrote down Jigme Lingpa's pre-liminary practices into a book called \"The Words of My Perfect Teacher\".\n\nIn the early 20th century the first publications on Tibetan Buddhism appeared in the west. An early publication on Dzogchen was the so-called \"Tibetan Book of the Dead,\" edited by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, which became highly popular, but contains many mistakes in translation and interpretation. Dzogchen has been popularized in the western world by the Tibetan diaspora, starting with the exile of 1959. Well-known teachers include Sogyal Rinpoche and Namkhai Norbu. The 14th Dalai Lama is also a qualified Dzogchen teacher.\n\nChögyam Trungpa, a master of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism, coined the term \"Maha Ati\" for Dzogchen, . He generally preferred to introduce Sanskrit rather than Tibetan terms to his students and felt \"Maha Ati\" was the closest equivalent for Dzogchen, although he acknowledged it was an unorthodox choice. The coinage does not follow the sandhi rules which would be rendered as mahāti. This serves as an indication of its pedigree as a calque.\n\nDzogchen has also been taught and practiced in the Kagyu lineage, beginning with the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339). \n\nThe Drikung Kagyu also have a tradition of Dzogchen teachings, the \"yangzab dzogchen\". \n\nLozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682), Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama ( 1876–1933), and Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama (present), all Gelugpas, are also noted Dzogchen masters, although their adoption of the practice of Dzogchen has been a source of controversy among more conservative members of the Gelug tradition.\n\nTibetan Buddhism developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in the Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya and Gelugpa schools. The Jonang school, which until recently was thought to be extinct, developed a different interpretation of ultimate truth.\nDzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view. Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind. The generic term for consciousness is \"shes pa\", and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Different forms of shes pa include \"ye shes\" (Jñāna, 'pristine consciousness') and \"shes rab\" (prajñā, wisdom). According to Sam van Schaik, two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the Ground (\"gzhi\") and Gnosis (\"rig pa\"), which represent the \"ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state\" respectively. Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the \"expanse\" (\"klong\" or \"dbyings\") or the \"true expanse\" (\"chos dbyings\", Sanskrit: Dharmadhatu). The term Dharmakaya is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen, as explained by Tulku Urgyen:\nDharmakaya is like space. You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space. Space is infinite in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.\n\nAccording to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist Buddha-nature doctrine of the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras. According to the 14th Dalai Lama the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness. According to Rinpoche Thrangu, Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature. According to Rinpoche Thrangu, \"whether one does Mahamudra or Dzogchen practice, buddha nature is the foundation from which both of these meditations develop.\"\n\nA key concept in Dzogchen is the 'basis', 'ground' or 'primordial state' (Tibetan: \"gzhi\", Sanskrit: \"sthana\"), also called the general ground (\"spyi gzhi\") or the original ground (\"gdod ma'i gzhi\"). The basis is the original state \"before realization produced buddhas and nonrealization produced sentient beings\". It is atemporal and unchanging and yet it is \"noetically potent\", giving rise to mind, delusion and wisdom. The basis is also associated with the term Dharmata.\n\nThe basis has three qualities:\n\nThe text, \"An Aspirational prayer for the Ground, Path and Result\" defines the three aspects of the basis thus:\n\nMoreover, the basis is associated with the primordial or original Buddhahood, also called Samantabhadra, which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood is not something to be gained, but an act of recognizing what is already immanent in all sentient beings. Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian Buddha-nature theory. Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (\"ma 'gags pa\"), universal (\"kun khyab\") and omnipresent.\n\n\"Rigpa\" (Sk: \"Vidya\", \"knowledge\") is a central concept in Dzogchen which means \"unconfused knowledge of the basis that is its own state\". It is \"reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom,\" which is self-reflexively aware of itself as unbounded wholeness. The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's true nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections; or like a crystal ball that takes on the colour of the material on which it is placed without itself being changed. The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified) is called rigpa.\n\nAccording to Alexander Berzin, there are three aspects of rigpa:\n\nAs Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (\"yon-tan\") of a Buddha are already \"are innate (\"lhan-skyes\") to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (\"gnyugs-ma\"), in the sense of having no beginning.\n\nSam van Schaik translates rigpa as \"gnosis\" which he glosses as \"a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state\". He notes that other definitions of rigpa include \"free from elaborations\" (\"srpos bral\"), \"non conceptual\" (\"rtog med\") and \"transcendent of the intellect\" (\"blo 'das\"). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction \"rig stong\" (gnosis-emptiness).\n\nJohn W. Pettit notes that \"rigpa\" is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as \"natural\" (\"ma bcos pa\") and \"effortless\" (\"rtsol med\") once recognized. Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.\n\n\"Ma Rigpa\" (avidyā) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. \"Ma rigpa\" is ignorance or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or Dharmata, which is associated with \"ye shes\" or 'pristine consciousness'. Automatically arising unawareness (\"lhan-skyes ma-rigpa\") exists because the basis is seen having a natural cognitive potentiality and luminosity (\"gdangs\"), which is the ground for samsara and nirvana. When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (\"rtsal\") of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not \"recognize its own face\", sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. As explained by Tulku Urgyen:\n\nIn the case of an ignorant sentient being the mind is called empty cognizance suffused with ignorance (marigpa). The mind of all the Buddhas is called empty cognizance suffused with awareness (rigpa).\n\nAccording to Vimalamitra's \"Illuminating Lamp\", delusion arises because sentient beings \"lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects\". This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of dependent origination. This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed manas as well as \"awareness moving away from the ground\".\n\nAccording to Sam van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that samsara and nirvana are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the Longchen Nyingtig for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being \"intrinsically innate to the individual mind\". The \"Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra’s Wisdom\" states:\n\nIf you think that he who is called “the heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra” is contained in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.\n\nLikewise, Longchenpa (12th century), writes in his \"Illuminating Sunlight\":\n\nEvery type of experiential content belonging to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural state that is a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, in a way that also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena belonging to samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.\n\nThis lack of difference between these two states, their non-dual (\"advaya\") nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (\"rang ngo sprod\") of what is already innately (\"lhan-skyes\") there. According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika, which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the \"doer\", the \"going\" and the \"going to\" (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).\n\nIn spite of this emphasis on immanence, Dzogchen texts do indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (\"kun gzhi\" or \"alaya\", \"sems\" or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (\"dharmakaya\" and \"rigpa\"). The Alaya and Ālayavijñāna are associated with karmic imprints (\"vasana\") of the mind and with mental afflictions (\"klesa\"). The \"alaya for habits\" is the basis (\"gzhi\") along with ignorance (\"marigpa\") which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies.\n\nThese terms stem from Indian Yogacara texts, such as the Ratnagotravibhāga.\n\nKoppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as Mipham attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with Madhyamaka, the earlier Nyingma author Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo did not. Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra. In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book Dzogchen, concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.\n\nDzogchen is a secret teaching emphasizing the rigpa view. It is a secret from those who are incapable of receiving it. The student can properly receive it with direct in-person realization under a guru's instruction. It is accessible to all; however, it is generally considered an advanced practice because safety from generating an incorrect view necessitates preliminary practices with a teacher's empowerment. \n\nDzogchen teachings emphasize naturalness, spontaneity and simplicity. Although Dzogchen is portrayed as being distinct from tantra, it has incorporated many concepts and practices from tantric Buddhism. It embraces a widely varied array of traditions, that range from a systematic rejection of all tantric practices, to a full incorporation of tantric practices.\n\nThe \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\" epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as the Three Statements of Garab Dorje (Tsik Sum Né Dek). They give in short the development a student has to undergo:\n\nIn subsequent centuries these teachings were expanded, most notably in the Longchen Nyingthig by Jigme Lingpa (1730-1798). His systematisation is the most widely used Dzogchen-teaching nowadays.\n\nThe dzogchen teachings consist of vast anthologies of practices presented as preliminary and auxiliary contemplative techniques, including standard Buddhist meditation techniques and tantra practices which have been integrated into Dzogchen.\n\nLongchenpa, in \"Finding Comfort and Ease in Meditation\" (\"bsam gtan ngal gso\"), the second text of the Trilogy of Natural Ease (\"ngal gso skor gsum\"), and its auto-commentary the \"Shing rta rnam dag\", uses the standard triad of meditative experiences (\"nyams\") to structure the text and the practices: bliss (\"bde ba\"), radiance/clarity (\"gsal ba\"), and non-conceptuality (\"mi rtog pa\"). This triad is also presented as preliminaries, main practice, and concluding phase. The preliminaries are further divided into:\n\nThis systematisation contextualized the system in terms of Tibetan Buddhism, while simultaneously relegating these preliminaries to a lower status, while emphasizing their necessity. Longchenpa couples meditation with Guru yoga in these preliminaries.\n\nThe teachings based on the \"Longchen Nyingthig\" are divided into preliminary practices and main practices. Alexander Berzin explicitly mentions meditative practices as a preliminary of the main practice.\n\nA general overview gives the following:\n\nThe \"Ngondro\", preliminary practices, consist of outer preliminaries and inner preliminaries.\n\nAccording to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, before one starts with the Dzogchen-practices empowerment is necessary. This plants the \"seeds of realization\" within the present body, speech and mind. Empowerment \"invests us with the ability to be liberated into the already present ground.\" The practices bring the seeds to maturation, resulting in the qualities of enlightened body, speech and mind.\n\nThe outer preliminaries are as follows:\n\nThe inner preliminaries are as follows: \n\nAccording to Berzin, receiving empowerment (\"dbang\", initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time is a necessary step to move on to the main practice. This activates our Buddha-mind, by consciously generating a state of mind that is accompanied by understanding. Alexander Berzin further notes:\n\nWith the influence of tantra, and the systematisations of Longchenpa, the main Dzogchen practices came to be preceded by preliminary (meditative) practices.\n\nIn the text \"Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind\" (\"sems nyid ngal gso\"), which is part of the Trilogy of Natural Ease (\"ngal gso skor gsum\"), Longchenpa arranges 141 contemplative practices, split into three sections: exoteric Buddhism (92), tantra (92), and the Great Perfection (27). Most of these practices are \"technique-free.\" The typical Buddhist meditations are relegated to the preliminary phase, while the main meditative practices are typical \"direct\" approaches.\n\nLongchenpa includes the perfection phase techniques of channels, winds and nuclei into the main and concluding phases. The \"concluding phase\" includes discussions of new contemplative techniques, which aid the practice of the main phase.\n\nThe Great Perfection practices as described by Jigme Lingpa consist of preliminary practices, specific for the Great Perfection practice, and the main practice.\n\nJigme Lingpa mentions two kinds of preliminary practices, \"'khor 'das ru shan dbye ba\", \"making a gap between samsara and nirvana,\" and \"sbyong ba\".\n\n\"Ru shan\" is a series of visualisation and recitation exercises, derived from the Seminal Heart tradition. The name reflects the dualism of the distinctions between mind and insight, ālaya and dharmakāya. Longchenpa places this practice in the \"enhancement\" (\"bogs dbyung\") section of his concluding phase. It describes a practice \"involving going to a solitary spot and acting out whatever comes to your mind.\"\n\n\"Sbyong ba\" is a variety of teachings for training (\"sbyong ba\") the body, speech and mind. The training of the body entails instructions for physical posture. The training of speech mainly entails recitation, especially of the syllable \"hūm\". The training of the mind is a Madhyamaka-like analysis of the concept of the mind, to make clear that mind cannot arise from anywhere, reside anywhere,or go anywhere. They are in effect an establishment of emptiness by means of the intellect.\n\nAccording to Alexander Berzin, after the preliminary practices follow meditative practices, in which the practitioners works with the three aspects of rigpa.\n\nThe three samadhis (ting-nge-’dzin gsum) are practiced, in which the practitioners works, in the imagination, with the three aspects of rigpa:\n\nThe Dzogchen meditation practices also include a series of exercises known as \"Semdzin\" (\"sems dzin\"), which literally means \"to hold the mind\" or \"to fix mind.\" They include a whole range of methods, including fixation, breathing, and different body postures, all aiming to bring one into the state of contemplation.\n\nThe practice of Trekchö (\"khregs chod\"), \"cutting through solidity\", reflects the earliest developments of Dzogchen, with its admonition against practice. In this practice one first identifies, and then sustains recognition of, one's own innately pure, empty awareness. Students receive pointing-out instruction (\"sems khrid\", \"ngos sprod\") in which a teacher introduces the student to the nature of his or her mind. According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, these instructions are received after the preliminary practices, though there's also a tradition to give them before the preliminary practices.\n\nJigme Lingpa divides the trekchö practice into ordinary and extraordinary instructions. The ordinary section comprises the rejection of the \"all is mind – mind is empty\" approach, which is a conceptual establishment of emptiness. Jigme Lingpa's extraordinary instructions give the instructions on the breakthrough proper, which consist of the setting out of the view (\"lta ba\"), the doubts and errors that may occur in practice, and some general instructions thematized as \"the four ways of being at leisure\" (\"cog bzhag\"). The \"setting out of the view\" tries to point the reader toward a direct recognition of rigpa, insisting upon the immanence of rigpa, and dismissive of meditation and effort.). Insight leads to \"nyamshag\", \"being present in the state of clarity and emptiness\".\n\n\"Tögal\" (\"thod rgal\") means \"spontaneous presence\", \"direct crossing\", \"direct crossing of spontaneous presence\", or \"direct transcendence. The literal meaning is \"to proceed directly to the goal without having to go through intermediate steps.\"\n\n\"Tögal\" is also called \"the practice of vision\", or \"the practice of the Clear Light (\"od-gsal\")\". It entails progressing through the Four Visions. The practices engage the subtle body of psychic channels, winds and drops (\"rtsa rlung thig le\"). The practices aim at generating a spontaneous flow of luminous, rainbow-colored images that gradually expand in extent and complexity.\n\n\"Tögal\" is an innovative practice, and reflects the innovations of the Manngede cycles in Dzogchen, and the incorporation of complex tantric techniques and doctrines. They are an adaptation of Tantric \"perfection phase\" techniques (\"rdzogs rim\"), as outlined in the early-eleventh-century Indian Tantric \"Kalachakra\" cycle, \"The Wheel of Time\", which was probably a direct inspiration for the Seminal Heart.\n\nLhun grub practice may lead to full enlightenment and the self-liberation of the human body into a rainbow body at the moment of death, when all the fixation and grasping has been exhausted. It is a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion. It is a manifestation of the Sambhogakāya.\n\nSome exceptional practitioners such as Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra are held to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a Sambhogakāya) with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "197394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197394", "title": "Bon", "text": "Bon\n\nBon, also spelled Bön (), is a Tibetan religion. According to traditional Bon beliefs and legends, the Bon religion predates the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet. According to the scholar and Buddhist master Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, there is clear manuscript evidence confirming the existence of fully articulated Bon doctrine and practice prior to the forcible annexation of the Bon kingdom of Zhangzhung in the 8th century CE by Tibetan king Trisong Deutsung: \"It is very clearly stated in the ancient lineage-manuscripts of Bon, known as \"Srid-rGyud\", during the reign of the Buddhist King Trisong Deutsen, that the tradition of Bon and its founder both first started [centuries earlier] in Zhangzhung.\" [This is disputed by some subsequent Buddhist commentators, e.g., by Sam van Schaik, \"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\" Its scriptures are derived primarily from termas (hidden teachings) and visions by tertöns (discoverers of hidden teachings) such as Loden Nyingpo..]\n\nAs Bon only arose in the eleventh century through the work of tertöns, Sam van Schaik claims it is improper to refer to the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet as Bon:\n\nThree Bon scriptures—\"mdo <nowiki>'</nowiki>dus\", \"gzer mig\", and \"gzi brjid\"—relate the mythos of Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche. The Bonpos regard the first two as \"gter ma\" rediscovered around the tenth and eleventh centuries and the last as \"nyan brgyud\" (oral transmission) dictated by Loden Nyingpo, who lived in the fourteenth century. In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a terma known as \"The Brilliance\" (), which contained the story of Tonpa Shenrab. He was not the first Bonpo tertön, but his terma became one of the definitive scriptures of Bon religion. It states that Shenrab established the Bon religion while searching for a horse stolen by a demon. Tradition also tells that he was born in the land of Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring (considered an axis mundi) which is traditionally identified as Mount Yung-drung Gu-tzeg (“Edifice of Nine Sauwastikas”), possibly Mount Kailash, in western Tibet. Due to the sacredness of Tagzig Olmo Lungting and Mount Kailash, the Bonpo regard both the swastika and the number nine as auspicious and as of great significance.\n\nTonpa Shenrab Miwoche visited Kongpo and found people whose practice involved spiritual appeasement with animal sacrifice. He taught them to substitute offerings with symbolic animal forms made from barley flour. He only taught according to the student's capability with lower shamanic vehicles to prepare; until with prayer, diligence, devotion and application they could incarnate to achieve sutra, tantra and Dzogchen.\n\nBon teachings feature Nine Vehicles, which are pathway-teaching categories with distinct characteristics, views, practices and results. Medicine, astrology, and divination are in the lower vehicles; then sutra and tantra, with Dzogchen (\"great perfection\") being the highest. Traditionally, the Nine Vehicles are taught in three versions: as Central, Northern and Southern treasures. The Central treasure is closest to Nyingma Nine Yānas teaching and the Northern treasure is lost. Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche elaborated the Southern treasure with shamanism.\n\n“A Cavern of Treasures” () is a Bon terma uncovered by Shenchen Luga () in the early 11th century. Martin identifies the importance of this scripture for studies of the Zhang-Zhung language:\nFor students of Tibetan culture in general, the \"mDzod phug\" is one of the most intriguing of all Bon scriptures, since it is the only lengthy bilingual work in Zhang-zhung and Tibetan. (Some of the shorter but still significant sources for Zhang-zhung are signalled in Orofino 1990.)\n\nThe Dzungar people invaded Tibet in 1717 and deposed a pretender to the position of Dalai Lama who had been promoted by Lhabzang, the titular King of Tibet. This was met with widespread approval. However, they soon began to loot the holy places of Lhasa, which brought a swift response from the Kangxi Emperor in 1718, but his military expedition was annihilated by the Dzungars not far from Lhasa.\n\nMany Nyingmapas and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras, which was said to make the tongue black or brown. This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapas and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras. A habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom into modern times.\n\nIn the 19th century, Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen, a Bon master whose collected writings comprise eighteen volumes significantly rejuvenated the tradition. His disciple Kagya Khyungtrul Jigmey Namkha trained many practitioners to be learned in not only the Bon religion, but in all Tibetan schools.\n\nAccording to the Bonpo, eighteen enlightened entities will manifest in this aeon and Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche, the founder of Bon, is considered the enlightened Buddha of this age (compare yuga and kalpa). The 33rd lineage holder of Menri Monastery, Menri Trizin Lungtog Tenpei Nyima and Lopön Tenzin Namdak are important current lineage holders of Bon.\n\nMore than three hundred Bon monasteries had been established in Tibet prior to Chinese annexation. Of these, Menri Monastery and Shurishing Yungdrung Dungdrakling Monastery were the two principal monastic universities for the study and practice of Bon knowledge and science-arts.\n\nEthnic Tibet is not confined culturally to China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The broader area of ethnic Tibet also includes, to the east and north, parts of the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan and the southern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; to the southwest, the Indian territories of Ladakh, Lahaul and Spiti and the Baltistan region of Pakistan; the extreme northwest of Assam; and to the south, Bhutan, Sikkim, and parts of northern Nepal, such as Mustang and Dolpo, the regions in northeastern Nepal inhabited by Sherpa and Tamang peoples, and extreme northern Burma (Myanmar). Even parts of modern Bangladesh were once a part of this \"Greater Tibet.\"\n\nBonpos cultivate household gods in addition to other deities:\n\nAnother set of deities are the White Old Man, a sky god, and his consort. They are known by a few different names, such as the Gyalpo Pehar called “King Pehar” (). Pehar is featured as a protecting deity of Zhangzhung, the center of the Bon religion. Reportedly, Pehar is related to celestial heavens and the sky in general. In early Buddhist times, Pehar transmogrified into a shamanic bird to adapt to the bird motifs of shamanism. Pehar's consort is a female deity known by one of her names as Düza Minkar (, Stein1954 in Hummel 1962).\n\nAccording to a recent Chinese census, an estimated 10 percent of Tibetans follow Bon. When Tibet was annexed into the People's Republic of China, there were approximately 300 Bon monasteries in Tibet and the rest of western China. According to a recent survey, there are 264 active Bon monasteries, convents, and hermitages.\n\nThe present spiritual head of the Bon is Lungtok Tenpa'i Nyima (1929–2017), the thirty-third Abbot of Menri Monastery (destroyed in the Cultural Revolution, but now rebuilt), who now presides over Pal Shen-ten Menri Ling in Dolanji in Himachal Pradesh, India, for the abbacy of which monastery he was selected in 1969.\n\nA number of Bon establishments also exist in Nepal; Triten Norbutse Bonpo Monastery is one on the western outskirts of Kathmandu. Bon's leading monastery is the refounded Menri Monastery in Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh, India.\n\nMany Bon elements are similar to the Hangui (韩规) religion of the Pumi people.\n\nLobsang Yeshe, recognized as the 5th Panchen Lama by the 5th Dalai Lama, was a member of the Dru family, an important family of the Bon religion. Under Lozang Gyatso, Bon became respected both philosophically and politically. However, the Bonpo remained stigmatized and marginalized until 1977, when they sent representatives to Dharamshala and the 14th Dalai Lama, who advised the Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration to accept Bon members.\n\nSince then, Bon has had official recognition of its status as a religious group, with the same rights as the Buddhist schools. This was re-stated in 1987 by the Dalai Lama, who also forbade discrimination against the Bonpos, stating that it was both undemocratic and self-defeating. He even donned Bon ritual paraphernalia, emphasizing \"the religious equality of the Bon faith\".\n\nHowever, Tibetans still differentiate between Bon and Buddhism, referring to members of the Nyingma, Shakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools as \"nangpa\", meaning \"insiders\", but to practitioners of Bon as \"Bonpo\", or even \"chipa\" (\"outsiders\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "199662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199662", "title": "Rock (confectionery)", "text": "Rock (confectionery)\n\nRock (often known by its place of origin, for instance Blackpool rock or Brighton rock) is a type of hard stick-shaped boiled sugar confectionery most usually flavoured with peppermint or spearmint. It is commonly sold at tourist (usually seaside) resorts in the United Kingdom (such as Brighton, Southend-on-Sea, Scarborough or Blackpool) and Ireland (e.g. Bray and Strandhill); in Gibraltar; in Denmark in towns such as Løkken and Ebeltoft; and in Sydney and Tasmania, Australia.\n\nIt usually takes the form of a cylindrical stick (\"a stick of rock\", or, in Scotland, \"a stalk of rock\"), normally in diameter and long. Blackpool rock is usually at least in diameter, and can be as thick as across and up to long when made for special retail displays. These cylinders usually have a pattern embedded throughout the length, which is often the name of the resort where the rock is sold, so that the name can be read on both ends of the stick (reversed at one end) and remains legible even after pieces are bitten off. Rock is also manufactured as a promotional item, for example with a company name running through it.\n\nIt is sometimes found in the form of individual sweets, with writing or a pattern in the centre; these are, in effect, slices of rock.\n\nTraditional seaside rock is made using granulated sugar and glucose syrup. The mix is approximately 3:1, i.e. three parts sugar to one part glucose syrup. This is mixed together in a pan with enough water to dissolve the sugar (not enough water will result in burning the sugar or the end product being sugary and possibly \"graining off\"). This is then boiled to approximately 147 °C or \"hard crack\" before being poured onto water-cooled steel plates. Once poured, food colourings for the casing and lettering are added and mixed in by hand using a spoon or small palette knife. Once the toffee mixture is poured onto a water-cooled plate, it begins to form a skin underneath, this makes it possible to cut out the colourings, using a pair of shears. The casings and lettering is constantly \"turned in\" to prevent \"chill\" (unsightly lumps in the finished product). The remainder of the toffee is stiffened up before going onto a \"pulling\" machine, a machine that has a fixed arm, and two moving arms, one rotating clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. The pulling machine aerates the toffee, turning it from a solid golden mass into the soft white that forms the centre of the stick of rock. Whilst on the pulling machine, flavourings are added by pouring in measured amounts. A small amount of now white toffee is taken from the pulling machine, this is used to keep the form of the letters which are made from the coloured toffee.\n\nLetters are formed by combining thin strips of multi colored and white toffee. When they are made, the face of each letter is approximately the size of a thumbprint, not the tiny size seen in the final, stretched product.\n\nThe letters are not made in order of appearance in the name (B, L, A, C, K, P, O, O, L) but by their shape; \"square\" letters, (B, E, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, W, X, Y and Z), are made first, as they will not lose their shape, while \"triangle\" (A and V) and \"round\" (C, D, G, O, Q, S, U) letters are made last to prevent them from losing their shape, as the toffee is still reasonably soft at this point. For example, the letters that make up \"BLACKPOOL ROCK\" may be made in this order: B, P, R, K(×2), L(×2), A, C(×2) and O(×3). The individual letters are placed between blocks or sticks at this point, to prevent them from losing shape and going flat. The letters are then placed in their correct spelling order with a \"strip\" of white, aerated toffee between each letter to make it readable.\n\nCapital letters are the most common form of lettering as small case lettering is far more complicated, owing to their tails and high backs.\n\nThe now aerated white toffee from the pulling machine is divided into three parts; one will form the centre and two will form the \"flaps\". The flaps are kneaded and spread thinly and evenly before being placed directly onto the letters; these form the space between the casing and letters, and are then wrapped around the stiffened centre. The casing is then kneaded and evenly rolled out, using a rolling pin, and this is then wrapped around the assembled \"boiling\", which is one very large bar of rock, usually too thick for a person to encircle in his hands, that is still pliable and warm. This is then placed into a \"batch roller\", which has several tapered rollers and heaters. The rollers keep the boiling of rock round and the heaters keep it just soft enough to work.\n\nA craftsman known as a \"sugar boiler\" then proceeds to \"spin out\", or stretch, the boiling onto a long flat slab, where rollers make sure it is kept rolling until it has set hard enough to maintain its round shape. The process of spinning out is what turns the very thick boiling into the much longer and much thinner final size. Once set, the strings of toffee are cut to length and wrapped in clear paper with a label, known as a \"view\" as it usually has a view of a landmark.\n\nThe whole process of making lettered rock is done by hand by skilled workers. Smaller sticks of rock, without letters or a \"view\", can be machine manufactured.\n\n\n\nRock is a different product from rock candy; it more closely resembles a harder candy cane.\n\nEdinburgh rock is another confection based on sugar and cream of tartar, made into sticks. It is friable and flavoured, for example, with ginger or lemon.\n\nAnother distinctively Scottish form of rock is star rock (also sometimes known as starry rock), or \"starrie\", which is made in Kirriemuir. It is sold in small bundles of pencil-sized sticks, and is less brittle than seaside rock.\n\n\n"}

Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (<>) to mark off ideographs.\n\nThe term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic Michael Calvin McGee (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions. McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology. Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.” Meanwhile, Celeste Condit and John Lucaites, influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.” Ideographs are common in advertising and political discourse.\n\nMcGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the \"Quarterly Journal of Speech\" in 1980. He begins his essay by defining the practice of ideology as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of ideology create social control.\n\nMcGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of political philosophy.” He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”: “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse. It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”\n\nAn ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition. Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the vocabulary for public values and decision-making that they are linked to ideology.\n\nThere is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as <liberty>, <property>, <freedom of speech>, <religion>, and <equality>. In each case, the term does not have a specific referent. Rather, each term refers to an abstraction which may have many different meanings depending on its context. It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power. If the definition of a term such as <equality> can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.\n\nBy encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of Richard Nixon’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the Watergate scandal by invoking “the principle of confidentiality.” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the \"rule of law\", Nixon pitted \"the principle of confidentiality” against the “rule of law,” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another. Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of confidentiality” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.\n\nWhile the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic rhetorical criticism, some political consultants and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.\n\nIdeographs appear in advertising and political campaigns regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “equality” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups. The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit & Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.\n\nAnother important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is <terrorism>. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the <War on Terror> and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”. Obama justified the <War on Terror> by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the <rule of law> and <democratic values>, we must fight against <terrorism>. Obama used this term to his advantage and made <terrorism> appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause. This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.\n\nMarouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of <liberty>, <equality>, or <privacy> epitomized in eugenics. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the Nazis used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race\".\n\nWhile rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as \"glittering generalities,” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.\n\nIn addition to practitioners, corporate marketing and political consulting use key terms in this way, concentrating on the image and branding of terms. For example, Frank Luntz tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as \"trigger words\" in an advertising campaign.\n\nThere are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics. First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use. By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.\n\nSecond, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the rhetorical study of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.\n\nThis leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics. McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children. This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).\n\n\"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity.\"\nThere exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures. The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures. Such as the concept of femininity that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.\n\nAt the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that\n“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the diachronic structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of synchronic relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”\nSuch an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific rhetorical situations as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as <property>, <patriarchy>, <religion>, <liberty>. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as <family values> and <equality>. Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include photographs. and objects represented in mass media.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202444", "title": "Ummah", "text": "Ummah\n\nIt is a synonym for ' (, 'the Islamic community'), and it is commonly used to mean the collective community of Islamic people. In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation. In the context of pan-Islamism and politics, the word ' can be used to mean the concept of a \"Commonwealth of the Believers\" ( \"\").\n\nThe word \"Ummah\" (pl. \"umam\") means Nation in Arabic. For example the Arabic term for the United Nations in Arabic is \"الأمم المتحدة Al-Umam Al-Mutahedah\", and the term \"الأمة العربية Al-Ummah Al-Arabeyah\" is used to refer to \"The Arabic Nation\". \n\nThe Word \"Ummah\" differs from the concept of a country or people. In it is greater context it is used to describe a larger group of people. For example, in Arabic the word شعب \"Sha'ab\" (\"people\") would be used to describe the citizens of Turkey. However, the term \"Ummah\" is used to describe the Turkic Nation as a whole, which includes Turkey, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and other countries and ethnic groups in Central Asia.\n\nThe phrase ' in the Quran (, \"One Nation\") refers to all the Islamic world as it existed at the time. The Quran says: \"You [Muslims] are the best nation brought out for Mankind, commanding what is righteous ( ', lit. \"recognized [as good]\") and forbidding what is wrong ( \", lit. \"recognized [as evil]\")\" [3:110].\n\nThe usage is further clarified by the Constitution of Medina, an early document said to have been negotiated by Muhammad in CE 622 with the leading clans of Medina, which explicitly refers to Jewish, Christians \nand pagan citizens of Medina as members of the \".\n\nAt the time of Muhammad, before the conception of the ummah, Arab communities were typically governed by kinship. In other words, the political ideology of the Arabs centered around tribal affiliations and blood-relational ties. In the midst of a tribal society, the religion of Islam emerged and along with it the concept of the ummah. The ummah emerged according to the idea that a messenger or prophet has been sent to a community. But unlike earlier messengers who had been sent to various communities in the past (as can be found among the Prophets in the Old Testament), Muhammad sought to develop a universal ummah and not only for the Arabs. Muhammad saw his purpose as the transmission of a divine message, and the leadership of the Islamic community. Islam sees Muhammad as the messenger to the ummah, transmitting a divine message, and implying that God is directing the life affairs of the ummah. Accordingly, the purpose of the ummah was to be based on religion, following the commands of God, rather than kinship.\n\nThere are a total of sixty-two instances that the term ummah is mentioned in the Qur'an. The use of ummah in the Qur'an almost always refers to ethical, linguistic, or religious bodies of people who are subject to the divine plan of salvation. The meaning of the term ummah in the Qur'an appears to transform throughout the chronology of the Qur'an. When it is first used in the Qur'an it is hardly distinguishable from the term \"qawm\" which can be translated to 'people'. The Qur'an recognizes that each ummah has a messenger that has been sent to relay a divine message to the community and that all ummahs await God's ultimate judgment. Although the meaning of the ummah begins simply with a general application of the word, it gradually develops to reference a general religious community and then evolves to specifically refer to the Muslim community. Before it refers exclusively to Muslims, the ummah encompasses Jewish and Christian communities as one with the Muslims and refers to them as the People of the Book. This is supplemented by the Constitution of Medina which declares all members of the ummah, regardless of religion, to be of ‘one ummah.' In these passages of the Qur'an, ummah may be referring to a unity of mankind through the shared beliefs of the monotheistic religions. However, Denny points out that the most recent ummah that receives a messenger from God is the Arab ummah. As the Muslims became stronger during their residence in Medina, the Arab ummah narrowed into an ummah exclusively for Muslims. This is evidenced by the resacralization of the Kaaba and Muhammad's command to take a pilgrimage to Mecca, along with the redirection of prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca. The period in which the term ummah is used most often is within the Third Meccan Period followed by the Medinian period. The extensive use of the term during these two time periods indicates that Muhammad was beginning to arrive at the concept of the ummah to specify the genuine Muslim community. Furthermore, the early Meccan passages generally equate ummah as religion, whereas in the Medinan period the passages of the Qur'an refer more specifically to the relation of the ummah and religion. The final passage that refers to ummah in the Qur'an refers to the Muslims as the \"best community\" and accordingly led to ummah as an exclusive reference to Islam.\n\nA verse in the Qur'an also mentions the ummah, in the context of all of the messengers, that this ummah (nation) of theirs is one ummah and that God is their Lord entirely:\n\nInitially it did not appear that the new Muslim community would oppose the tribes that already existed in Mecca. The first Muslims did not need to make a break with traditional Quraysh customs since the vision for the new community included moral norms that were not unfamiliar to the tribal society of Mecca. However, what distinguished this community from the tribes was its focus of the place of those morals within a person's life.\n\nAfter Muhammad and the first converts to Islam were forced to leave Mecca, the community was welcomed in Medina by the Ansar, a group of Pagans who had converted to Islam. Despite Medina already being occupied by numerous Jewish and polytheistic tribes, the arrival of Muhammad and his followers provoked no opposition from Medina's residents. Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad established the Constitution of Medina with the various tribal leaders in order to form the Meccan immigrants and the Medinan residents into a single community, the ummah. Rather than limiting members of the ummah to a single tribe or religious affiliation as had been the case when the ummah first developed in Mecca, the Constitution of Medina ensured that the ummah was composed of a variety of people and beliefs essentially making it to be supra-tribal. Islamic historian, Tabari, suggested that Muhammad's initial intentions upon arriving in Medina was to establish a mosque, however this is unlikely Tabari also claimed that Muhammad observed the first Friday prayer in Medina. It occurred on Friday because Friday served as a market day in Medina to enable Jews to observe the sabbath. Membership to the ummah was not restricted to adhering to the Muslim faith but rather encompassed all of the tribes as long as they vowed to recognize Muhammad as the community and political figure of authority. The Constitution of Medina declared that the Jewish tribes and the Muslims from Medina formed 'one ummah.' It is possible that the Medinan ummah was purely secular (compared to the later transformation of the ummah in Mecca) due to its variety of beliefs and practices of its members. The purpose of the Constitution of Medina was to uphold political obligations and social relations between the various tribes. The community members in Medina, although not derived from the same faith, were committed to each other through a desire to defend the common good of the community. In other words, the community was united according to preserve its shared interests. The people of other religious beliefs, particularly those that are considered to be \"People of the Book\" were granted the special protection of God through the dhimmah contract. These other religious groups were guaranteed security by God and Muhammad because of their common religious history as being the \"People of the Book.\" The dhimmah served as a sort of alliance between Muslims and non-Muslims. In the earlier treaties of the dhimmah, both groups were viewed as equal in status and both were obligated to help the other. However, in later treaties, after Islam had gained more power throughout Arabia, the dhimmah was perceived as the fulfilment of the religious duties of Muslims along with the payment of zakat. With the new contract of dhimmah, non-Muslims' protection by God and Muhammad became dependent on their payment.\n\nThe Constitution of Medina is a document created by Muhammad to regulate social and political life in Medina. It deals with various tribal issues such as the organization and leadership of the participating tribal groups, warfare, blood money, ransom of captives, and war expenditures. It is at the beginning of the document that the Muslims from the Quraysh (those from Mecca) and the Muslims from Yathrib (those from Medina) are declared to be an ummah or one community. The word ummah appears again when the document refers to the treaty of the Jews and states that the Yahūd Banī ' Awf, or Jews, are an ummah that exists alongside the ummah of the Muslims or may be included in the same ummah as the Muslims. The document does state that the Jews who join the Muslims will receive aid and equal rights. In addition, the Jews will be guaranteed security from the Muslims, and are granted to maintain their own religion just as the Muslims will maintain theirs. This implies that the ummah is not strictly a religious community in Medina. The Constitution of Medina lists the various Medinan tribes derived from the Aws and Khazraj as well as the several Jewish tribes that are granted to keep their tribal organization and leadership. The document also reveals that each group, the Muslims and the Jews, is responsible for its own finances except during time of war, when the two are able to share expenses.\n\nAfter the Muslim takeover of Mecca, membership in the ummah required a commitment to Islam. This happened as a result of Islam beginning to distinguish itself not just from Paganism but also Judaism and Christianity by emphasizing a model of community based on Abraham. The membership of the ummah was now based on two main principles; the first is to worship God alone and secondly, in order to worship God properly one must be in a guided community.\n\nThe essentials of the new society were the new relations between human beings and God and between human beings and one another. The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden. Muhammad's community was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202447", "title": "Satay", "text": "Satay\n\nSatay ( , ), or sate in Indonesian spelling, is a Southeast Asian dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. It is a dish from Indonesia; and popular in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu; the more authentic version uses skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond, although bamboo skewers are often used. These are grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire, then served with various spicy seasonings. Satay can be served in various sauces, however most often they are served in a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.\n\nSatay originated on the Indonesian island of Java. It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. It is also popular in many other Southeast Asian countries including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. A key feature of Thai satay is the inclusion of pork as a meat option, and Thai-style peanut sauce. Meanwhile, Indonesian satay is often served with kecap manis - a sweet soy sauce, and is often accompanied with lontong, a type of rice cake. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.\n\nSatay is a popular delicacy in Indonesia. The country's diversity (see Indonesian cuisine) has produced a wide variety of satays. In Indonesia, satay is a popular street food, it can be obtained from a travelling satay vendor, from a street-side tent-restaurant, in an upper-class restaurant, or at traditional celebration feasts.\n\nClose analogues are yakitori from Japan, kǎoròu chuàn from China, shish kebab from Turkey and the Middle East, shashlik from the Caucasus, and sosatie from South Africa. It is listed at number 14 on \"World's 50 most delicious foods\" readers' poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011.\n\nContemporary scholars say that the English word \"satay\" is derived from , and , both perhaps of Tamil origin, and that satay was developed by Javanese street vendors as an adaptation of Indian kebabs. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as \"tongseng\" and \"gulai kambing\" based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century.\n\nFrom Java, satay spread through the Malay Archipelago and, as a consequence, numerous variations of the dish have been developed. By the late-19th century, satay had crossed the Strait of Malacca into neighbouring Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. In the 19th century, the term migrated, presumably with Malay immigrants from the Dutch East Indies, to South Africa, where it is known as \"sosatie\". The Indo Dutch people took this dish, as well as many other Indonesian specialties, to the Netherlands, thereby influencing Dutch cuisine.\n\nMeat commonly used includes chicken, lamb, goat, mutton, beef, venison and rabbit; seafoods such as fish, shrimp and squid; or offal such as liver, intestine and tripe. Some have also used more exotic varieties of meat, such as turtle, crocodile, horse, lizard and snake meat. Most of the time, the meat is cut into small cubes shape, about thumb-size. However, such recipes as Ponorogo use chicken fillet cut into an elongated finger-like shape, thus one skewer holds only one piece.\n\nThe skewers used for chicken satay are traditionally made from \"lidi\", a midrib of coconut fronds. Bamboo skewers might be used instead. For firmer meats, such as lamb, goat, and beef, a thicker bamboo skewer is used. The skewers are usually soaked in water before using to avoid burning during grilling. Each skewer usually holds four pieces of meat, some only three pieces. A goat meat satay might insert a cube of fat between meat cubes. Turmeric is required to marinate satay to give the dish its characteristic yellow color. Another popular marinade is sweet soy sauce mixed with coconut oil or palm margarine. The skewered meat is seasoned, marinated, and then grilled on charcoal embers.\n\nSatay may be served with a spicy peanut sauce dip, or peanut gravy, served with slices of \"lontong\" or \"ketupat\" (rice cakes), and accompanied by \"acar\" (pickles) consisting of slivers of onions, carrots and cucumbers in vinegar, salt, and sugar solution. Mutton satay is usually served with \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce) instead of peanut sauce. Pork satay can be served in a pineapple-based satay sauce or cucumber relish. An Indonesian version uses a soy sauce-based dip.\n\nIndonesia is the home of satay (known as \"sate\" in Indonesian and pronounced similar to the English \"satay\"), and satay is a widely renowned dish in almost all regions of Indonesia; it is considered the national dish and one of Indonesia's best dishes. Satays, in particular, are a staple in Indonesian cuisine, served everywhere from street carts to fine dining establishments, as well as in homes and at public gatherings. As a result, many variations have been developed throughout the Indonesian Archipelago. \n\nIn Indonesia there are some restaurants that specialized on serving various kinds of satay and present it as their specialty, such as Sate Ponorogo Restaurant, Sate Blora Restaurant, and also chains of Sate Khas Senayan restaurants, previously known as Satay House Senayan. In Bandung, the West Java Governor's office is popularly called Gedung Sate () to refer the satay-like pinnacle on its roof. \n\nIndonesia has the richest variations of satay in the world. The satay variants in Indonesia usually named after the region its originated, the meats, parts or ingredients its uses, also might named after the process or method of cooking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown as \"sate\" in Malay (and pronounced similarly to the English \"satay\"), it can be found throughout all the states of Malaysia in restaurants and on the street, with hawkers selling satay in food courts and Pasar malam. While the popular kinds of satay are usually beef and chicken satays, different regions of Malaysia have developed their own unique variations. Sate is often associated with Muslim Malays, but pork sate is also available at non-halal Chinese eating establishments.\n\nThere are a number of well-known satay outlets in Kajang, Selangor which is dubbed the Sate City in the country. \"Sate Kajang\" is a generic name for a style of sate where the meat chunks are bigger than normal, and the sweet peanut sauce served along with a portion of fried chilli paste. Given its popularity, sate Kajang is now found throughout Malaysia. Stalls and restaurants around Kajang offer not only the more traditional chicken or beef satay, but also more exotic meats such as venison, rabbit or fish, as well as gizzard, liver, and a number of other variations.\n\nAnother type of meat satay is the \"sate lok-lok\" from Penang and \"sate celup\" (dip satay) from Malacca. Both are Malaysian Chinese fusions of the hotpot and the Malay satay. Pieces of raw meat, tofu, century eggs, quail eggs, fish cake, offal or vegetables are skewered on bamboo sticks. These are cooked by being dipped in boiling water or stock. The satay is then eaten with a sweet, dark sauce, sometimes with chilli sauce as an accompaniment. If the satay is eaten with satay sauce, it is called sate lok-lok. If the satay is cooked with boiling satay peanut sauce, it is called sate celup. Both dishes are available from street vendors or in certain restaurants, and the majority are not halal. Customers use a common container containing boiling stock to personally cook their satay. Sauces are either served in common containers or individually. There are usually no tables near street vendors, and customers thus tend to gather around the food cart.\n\nKnown as \"saté\" or \"sateh\", it is fully adapted in Dutch everyday cuisine. Owed to their shared colonial history, satay is an Indonesian food that has become an integral part of Dutch cuisine. Pork and chicken satays are almost solely served with spicy peanut sauce and called \"een sateetje\", and are readily available in snackbars and supermarkets. Versions with goat-meat (\"sateh kambing\") and sweet soy sauce are available in Indonesian restaurants and take-aways. Pork or chicken satay in peanut sauce, with salad and French-fries, is popular in pubs or \"eetcafes\". With Indonesian take-away meals like \"nasi goreng speciaal\", the special part is often a couple of sate-sticks. Another favourite in Dutch snackbars is the \"satékroket\", a croquette made with a peanut sauce and shredded meat ragout.\n\nIn the majority of the Philippines, satay (especially pork or chicken) is referred to by the generic English name \"barbecue\" (usually shortened to \"BBQ\"). This association is the source of the portmanteau names for other popular street foods that are also served skewered, such as banana cue (\"banana\" + \"barbecue\") and camote cue (\"\"camote\" (sweet potato) + barbecue\").\n\nSatay is known as \"satti\" in the Southern Philippines (especially in the regions of Zamboanga, Sulu Archipelago and Tawi-Tawi). \"Satti\" is usually made from chicken or beef among Muslim Filipinos. It is particularly popular in Tausug cuisine and is commonly eaten as breakfast in restaurants which specialize in \"satti\". It is typically served with \"ta'mu\" (\"pusô\" in other Philippine languages) and a bowlful of warm sauce.\n\nOffal-based versions of satay are also commonly sold in the Philippines as street food. The most popular are made from chicken or pork intestines known as \"isaw.\" Other variants use liver, tripe, lungs, chicken heads and feet, cubes of coagulated pork blood, and pork ears, among others.\n\nAnnatto seeds and banana ketchup-based sauces are also widely used which gives the meat a vibrant orange or red color.\n\nIn Singapore, satay is sold by Chinese, Malay and Indian Muslim vendors. It is thought to have originated in Java and brought to Singapore by Muslim traders. Satay is one of the earliest foods to be associated with Singapore; it has been associated with the city since the 1940s. Previously sold on makeshift roadside stalls and pushcarts, concerns over public health and the rapid development of the city led to a major consolidation of satay stalls at Beach Road in the 1950s, which came to be collectively called the \"Satay Club\". They were moved to the Esplanade Park in the 1960s, where they grew to the point of being constantly listed in tourism guides.\nOpen only after dark with an open air or \"al fresco\" dining concept, the Satay Club defined how satay is served in Singapore since then, although they are also found across the island in most hawker stalls, modern food courts, and upscale restaurants at any time of the day. Moved several times around Esplanade Park due to development and land reclamation, the outlets finally left the area permanently to Clarke Quay in the late 1990s to make way for the building of the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay.\n\nSeveral competing satay hotspots have since emerged, with no one being able to lay claim to the reputation the Satay Club had at the Esplanade. While the name has been transferred to the Clarke Quay site, several stalls from the original Satay club have moved to Sembawang in the north of the city. The satay stalls which opened at Lau Pa Sat are popular with tourists. Served only at night when Boon Tat Street is closed to vehicular traffic and the stalls and tables occupy the street, it mimics the open-air dining style of previous establishments. Other notable outlets include the ones at Newton Food Centre, East Coast Park Seafood Centre and Toa Payoh Central.\n\nPeanut sauce is used in Singaporean satays, Malay satay is quite similar to Indonesian satay by using \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce), while Chinese Hainan satay uses pineapple purée sauce and marinated in five-spice powder. The common types of satay sold in Singapore include \"Satay Ayam\" (chicken satay), \"Satay Lembu\" (beef satay), \"Satay Kambing\" (mutton satay), \"Satay Perut\" (beef intestine), and \"Satay Babat\" (beef tripe).\n\nSingapore's national carrier, Singapore Airlines, also serves satay to its First and Business Class(previously known as raffles class) passengers as an appetizer.\n\n\"Sathe\" as it is known in Sri Lanka is a Sri Lankan Malay dish that has become a staple of the country's diet. \"Sathe\" is served with peanut and chili sauce. It is sometimes called \"sate daging\" by the country's Malay community.\n\nSatay (, , ) is a popular dish in Thailand. Usually served with peanut sauce and \"achat\", Thai satay have various recipes, from chicken, beef, and pork, to vegetarian variants that employ soy protein strips or tofu. Satay can easily be found in virtually any Thai restaurant worldwide. Satay came to Thailand via Indonesia. Because Thai cuisine is heavily marketed internationally and has attracted world culinary attention earlier than Indonesian cuisine, despite its Indonesian origin, there is a widespread misconception abroad that satay originated from Thailand. As a result, it is most frequently associated with Thai food. For example, in the United States, satay is said to be one of America's favorite Thai dishes.\n\nNonetheless, as the Thai satay has evolved over time through the use of different marinades, sauces and meats from the original version of the dish, it can be argued that the Thai and Indonesian satays are two different dishes that only share the same name and origin. Due to the global popularity of Thai cuisine and the lower numbers of Indonesian restaurants outside of Indonesia, diners outside the region, particularly those in the West, are more likely to be referring to the Thai version rather than the original Indonesian version when referencing the dish. A Thai popular street food, \"Khao Niaow Moo Ping\", grilled pork on a skewer, is believed to be influenced by satay.\n\nThe first satay restaurant in Thailand was in front of Chaloem Buri Theater near the Chaloem Buri Intersection in the Yaowarat neighborhood. Now it is on Rama IV Road near Lumphini MRT station and has been for more than 50 years.\n\nA popular misconception is that the term \"satay\" is a peanut sauce. Traditionally, satay referred to any grilled skewered meats with various sauces; it is not necessarily served solely with peanut sauce. However, since the most popular variant of satay is chicken satay in peanut sauce (\"Sate Madura\" in Indonesia, \"Sate Kajang\" in Malaysia, and Thai chicken satay with peanut sauce), in modern fusion cuisine the term \"satay\" has shifted to satay style peanut sauce instead.\n\nFor example, the fusion \"satay burger\" refers to beef hamburger served with so-called \"satay sauce\", which is mainly a kind of sweet and spicy peanut sauce or often replaced with gloppy peanut butter. The Singapore satay bee hoon is actually rice vermicelli served in peanut sauce. The American-Thai fusion fish fillet in satay sauce also demonstrates the same trend. The fusion French cuisine \"Cuisses de Grenouilles Poelees au Satay, Chou-fleur Croquant\" is actually frog legs in peanut sauce. The Indomie instant noodle is also available in satay flavour, which is only the addition of peanut sauce in its packet. In Hong Kong, satay sauce is usually served with instant noodles and stir-fried beef. This dish is most often eaten for breakfast.\n\n\n"}

An especially popular brand was Louis Roederer's, who shipped a third of his production to Russia.\n\nCristal was first created in 1876 for Alexander II of Russia, and is viewed by many as the first \"prestige cuvée\". As the political situation in Russia at the time of his rule was unstable, the Tsar feared assassination. He ordered that champagne bottles for his Three Emperors Dinner be made clear, so that he could see the bubbles and also to prevent an explosive being hidden beneath them, as could happen with a typical dark green indented bottle. Louis Roederer commissioned a Flemish glassmaker to create a clear lead glass Champagne bottle with a flat bottom. The Champagne has since become known as \"Cristal\".\n\nThe wine was not commercially available until 1945. \nIn the mid 1990s and early 2000s, the brand became increasingly associated with hip hop music and culture, with several artists referencing the drink in song lyrics and as part of their public image, including Raekwon, 50 Cent, The Notorious B.I.G., R. Kelly, Sean Combs, Big L, Trina, and Jay-Z. The nickname \"Crissy\" is sometimes used for the drink. Tupac Shakur created a cocktail called \"Thug Passion\", which is a blend of Alizé Gold Passion and Cristal.\nIn an interview with \"The Economist\" in 2006, Louis Roederer managing director Frederic Rouzaud said he viewed the attention from rappers with \"curiosity and serenity.\" Asked if he thought the association would harm the brand, he replied, \"that's a good question, but what can we do? We can't forbid people from buying it. I'm sure Dom Pérignon or Krug would be delighted to have their business.\" Subsequent interpretations and reactions to these statements resulted in the brand's loss of position in hip-hop culture. Cristal went from being the rappers' default to being discarded. Jay-Z released a statement saying he would never \"drink Cristal or promote it in any way or serve it at any of [his] clubs\" for what he felt was off-hand, patronizing disrespect for the culture of hip hop.\n\nThe 1974 vintage was the first release of a rosé Cristal. The grape composition is an approximately equal blend of Chardonnay and Pinot noir, while the rosé contains more Pinot noir, and is colored with red wine rather than Pinot noir grape skins, the \"saignée\" method. The 2000 vintage is 55% Pinot Noir and 45% Chardonnay, with a dosage of 10 g/l. The annual production of Cristal is about 1,000,000 bottles.\n\n"}
{"id": "205264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205264", "title": "Internal medicine", "text": "Internal medicine\n\nInternal medicine or general medicine (in Commonwealth nations) is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases. Physicians specializing in internal medicine are called internists, or physicians (without a modifier) in Commonwealth nations. Internists are skilled in the management of patients who have undifferentiated or multi-system disease processes. Internists care for hospitalized and ambulatory patients and may play a major role in teaching and research.\n\nBecause internal medicine patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Internists often have subspecialty interests in diseases affecting particular organs or organ systems.\n\nInternal medicine is also a specialty within clinical pharmacy and veterinary medicine.\n\nThe etymology of the term \"internal medicine\" in English is rooted in the German term \"Innere Medizin\" from the 19th century. Internal medicine delved into underlying pathological causes of symptoms and syndromes by use of laboratory investigations in addition to bedside clinical assessment of patients. In contrast, physicians in previous generations, such as the 17th-century physician Thomas Sydenham, who is known as the father of English medicine or \"the English Hippocrates\", had developed nosology (the study of diseases) via the clinical approach to diagnosis and management, by careful bedside study of the natural history of diseases and their treatment. Sydenham eschewed dissection of corpses and scrutiny of the internal workings of the body, for considering the internal mechanisms and causes of symptoms. It was thus subsequent to the 17th century that there was a rise in anatomical pathology and laboratory studies, with Giovanni Battista Morgagni, an Italian anatomist of the 18th century, being considered the father of anatomical pathology. Laboratory investigations became increasingly significant, with contribution of doctors including German physician and bacteriologist Robert Koch in the 19th century. The 19th century saw the rise of internal medicine that combined the clinical approach with use of investigations. Many early-20th century American physicians studied medicine in Germany and brought this medical field to the United States. Thus, the name \"internal medicine\" was adopted in imitation of the existing German term.\n\nHistorically, some of the oldest traces of internal medicine can be traced from Ancient India and Ancient China. Earliest texts about internal medicine are the Ayurvedic anthologies of Charaka.\n\nInternal medicine specialists, also known as general internal medicine specialists or general medicine physicians in Commonwealth countries, are specialist physicians trained to manage particularly complex or multisystem disease conditions that single-organ-disease specialists may not be trained to deal with. They may be asked to tackle undifferentiated presentations that cannot be easily fitted within the expertise of a single-organ specialty, such as dyspnoea, fatigue, weight loss, chest pain, confusion or change in conscious state. They may manage serious acute illnesses that affect multiple organ systems at the same time in a single patient, and they may manage multiple chronic diseases or \"comorbidities\" that a single patient may have. \n\nGeneral internal medicine specialists do not provide necessarily less expertise than single-organ specialists, rather, they are trained for a specific role of caring for patients with multiple simultaneous problems or complex comorbidities.\n\nPerhaps because it is complex to explain treatment of diseases that are not localised to a single-organ, there has been confusion about the meaning of internal medicine and the role of an \"internist.\" Internists are qualified physicians with postgraduate training in internal medicine and should not be confused with \"interns\", who are doctors in their first year of residency training (officially the term intern is no longer in use). Although internists may act as primary care physicians, they are not \"family physicians,\" \"family practitioners,\" or \"general practitioners,\" whose training is not solely concentrated on adults and may include surgery, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The American College of Physicians defines internists as \"physicians who specialize in the prevention, detection and treatment of illnesses in adults\".\n\nInternal medicine physicians have practiced both in clinics and in hospitals, often in the same day. Pressures on time have led to many internal medicine physicians to choose one practice setting, who may choose to practice only in the hospital, as a \"hospitalist\", or only in an outpatient clinic, as a primary care physician.\n\nThe training and career pathways for internists vary considerably across the world.\n\nMany programs require previous undergraduate education prior to medical school admission. This \"pre-medical\" education is typically four or five years in length. Graduate medical education programs vary in length by country. Medical education programs are tertiary-level courses, undertaken at a medical school attached to a university. In the United States, medical school consists of four years. Hence, gaining a basic medical education may typically take eight years, depending on jurisdiction and university.\n\nFollowing completion of entry-level training, newly graduated medical practitioners are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before the licensure, or \"registration\", is granted, typically one or two years. This period may be referred to as \"internship\", \"conditional registration\", or \"foundation programme\". Then, doctors may finally follow specialty training in internal medicine if they wish, typically being selected to training programs through competition. In North America, this period of postgraduate training is referred to as residency training, followed by an optional fellowship if the internist decides to train in a subspecialty. In Commonwealth countries, during that training period in internal medicine, trainees are often called senior house officers, and advance to registrar grade when they undergo a compulsory subspecialty training whilst commonly continuing service provision in the main speciality. In the United States, residency training for internal medicine lasts three years.\n\nIn the United States, three organizations are responsible for certification of trained internists (i.e., doctors who have completed an accredited residency training program) in terms of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are essential for excellent patient care: the American Board of Internal Medicine, the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine and the Board of Certification in Internal Medicine.\n\nIn the United States, two organizations are responsible for certification of subspecialists within the field: the American Board of Internal Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine. Physicians (not only internists) who successfully pass board exams get \"board certified\" status.\n\nThe following are the subspecialties recognized by the American Board of Internal Medicine.\n\n\nThe American College of Osteopathic Internists recognizes the following subspecialties:\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the three medical Royal Colleges (the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow) are responsible for setting curricula and training programmes through the Joint Royal Colleges Postgraduate Training Board (JRCPTB), although the process is monitored and accredited by the General Medical Council (which also maintains the specialist register).\n\nDoctors who have completed medical school spend two years in foundation training completing a basic postgraduate curriculum. After two years of Core Medical Training (CT1/CT2) and attaining the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, physicians commit to one of the medical specialties: \n\nMany training programmes provide dual accreditation with general (internal) medicine and are involved in the general care to hospitalised patients. These are acute medicine, cardiology, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, endocrinology and diabetes mellitus, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, renal medicine, respiratory medicine and often, rheumatology. The role of general medicine, after a period of decline, was reemphasised by the Royal College of Physicians of London report from the Future Hospital Commission (2013).\n\nMedicine is mainly focused on the art of diagnosis and treatment with medication, but many subspecialties administer procedural treatment:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "205362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205362", "title": "Spanish omelette", "text": "Spanish omelette\n\nSpanish omelette is the English name for a traditional dish from Spanish cuisine called tortilla española, tortilla de patatas or tortilla de papas. It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes, sometimes also with onion and/or chives or garlic; fried in oil and often served cold as an appetizer. It is part of the cuisine of Spain.\n\nIn Spanish \"tortilla\" is the diminutive form of \"torta\" \"cake\"; this dish is called \"tortilla de patatas\" or \"tortilla española\" to distinguish it from a plain omelette (\"tortilla francesa\", literally \"\"French omelette\"\"). These dishes are unrelated to the maize or wheat tortilla of Mexico and neighbouring countries, which is a thin flatbread. In most of Hispanic America, where both the flatbread and potato omelette are eaten, the omelette is called \"tortilla española\" to distinguish it from the maize tortilla of the region. Because the potato is called \"papa\" in much of Hispanic America (instead of the term \"patata\" used in Spain), this dish can sometimes be referred to as \"tortilla de papas\" in that region as well.\n\nThe Spanish tortilla (\"tortilla de patatas\" in Spain) is widely eaten in Spain and some Spanish-speaking countries. While there are numerous regional variations, the basic version is made only with eggs and potatoes, and possibly onion. The addition of the onion is often controversial and usually related to the tenderness of the local varieties of potatoes. To avoid confusions some restaurants distinguish between the plain \"tortilla de patatas\" and the \"tortilla de patatas con cebolla\" (with onion).\n\nThe potatoes, ideally a starchy variety, are cut into thin slices or small dice. They are then seasoned and sautéed in cooking oil, with sliced onions being added at this stage if used. These ingredients are stirred at a moderate temperature until they are soft but not brown. The potatoes (and onions, if included) are then removed, drained, and mixed with beaten eggs. This mixture is then returned to the pan and slowly fried, turning to fry both sides. Once the eggs are cooked on one side, a pan should be placed over the mixture and it can be inverted onto the separate pan or plate. The mixture is then slipped back into the pan to cook the other side. The essential ingredients are eggs, potatoes, and salt; onion or garlic is sometimes added; seasonings such as pepper, parsley or oregano may be added as well. Other ingredients such as green or red peppers, chorizo or other sausage, tuna, shrimp or different vegetables, may also be included as well, although the result is not strictly a tortilla de patatas/papas. The Spanish government nutrition web site specifies extra virgin olive oil and includes onion, but some recipes simply state vegetable oil.\n\nThe tortilla may be eaten hot or cold; it is commonly served as a \"tapa\" or picnic dish throughout Spain. As a tapa, it may be cut into bite-size pieces and served on cocktail sticks; a large tortilla can be cut into triangular portions (\"pincho de tortilla\") to be eaten as a finger food.\n\nThe first reference to the tortilla in Spanish is found in a Navarrese document, as an anonymous \"Mousehole's memorial\" addressed to the Navarra region's court in 1817. It explains the sparse conditions of Navarre's farmers in contrast with those in Pamplona (the capital) and la Ribera (in southern Navarre). After listing the sparse food eaten by highlanders, the next quote follows: \"…two to three eggs in tortilla for 5 or 6 [people] as our women do know how to make it big and thick with less eggs, mixing potatoes, breadcrumbs or whatever.\"\n\nAccording to legend, during the siege of Bilbao, Carlist general Tomás de Zumalacárregui invented the \"\"tortilla de patatas\"\" as an easy, fast and nutritious dish to satisfy the scarcities of the Carlist army. Although it remains unknown whether this is true, it appears the tortilla started to spread during the early Carlist wars.\n\nAnother tale is that the recipe was learnt by Spanish prisoners captured after the Battle of Montes Claros during the Portuguese Restoration War in 1665. After the Portuguese victory, more than 6000 Spanish soldiers were kept in captivity for 2 years until the Treaty of Lisbon was signed. Upon their release, these prisoners brought part of the culture of Alentejo to Spain, including many recipes, which featured a potato egg pie that evolved into the modern version of \"tortilla\".\n\nSpanish omelettes can range from authentic and carefully made seasoned preparations of raw potatoes of a variety carefully selected for best results, eggs, optional onions and good olive oil and nothing else, to nontraditional preparations with many additional ingredients.\n\nSome of the many additions to the base ingredients include green peppers, chorizo, courgette, aubergine, mushrooms, and diced ham. The \"tortilla paisana\" includes red pepper and peas. The tortilla is supposed to be juicy and usually fairly thick, ranging from about ; circumference ranges from a small individual tortilla to about . In Spain a tortilla is almost always accompanied by bread and sometimes with fried pimientos de padron. In most bars and canteens, it is served in a sandwich (\"bocadillo)\". A tortilla will remain juicy for around 24 hours, after this it will solidify (see picture to the right). \n\nA very large tortilla was made by 12 chefs in Vitoria, Spain in 2014, claiming to be a record. It was in diameter, and used 1.6 tons of potatoes, 16,000 eggs, of oil, of onions, and of salt.\n\n"}
{"id": "206990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206990", "title": "Lancashire hotpot", "text": "Lancashire hotpot\n\nLancashire hotpot is a stew originating from Lancashire in the North West of England. It consists of lamb or mutton and onion, topped with sliced potatoes and baked in a heavy pot on a low heat.\n\nIn Lancashire before industrialisation, families would work at home spinning thread while scrags of mutton stewed slowly over a low fire. Family members could attend to the cooking over many hours. In the initial stages of industrialisation and urbanisation, both men and women of all ages had long, strictly-regulated work hours that made it impossible to cook food that required extensive attention and preparation time. Often lacking their own cooking facilities, housewives would carry a pudding or stew to the baker's oven and leave it there to cook.\n\nThe recipe usually calls for a mix of mutton (nowadays more frequently lamb) and onions covered with sliced potato. Many regional variations add vegetables (carrot, turnip, or leeks). Many early recipes add lamb kidneys and modern variants may use beef or bacon chops instead of lamb, or have a pastry topping.\n\nThe traditional recipe once included oysters, but increasing cost eliminated them from common usage. Pickled red cabbage or beetroot, and in some areas Lancashire cheese, are often served as an accompaniment.\n\nIt is often thought that the \"hot pot\" referred to is a pottery dish used to cook casseroles in British cuisine. However, it is more likely to refer to the idea of a jumble or hodge podge of ingredients in the filling. Sir Kenelm Digby's 1677 \"The Closet Opened\" contains a recipe for the \"Queen Mothers Hotchpot of Mutton\". Similarly, \"Mrs Beeton's Cookery Book\" contains a recipe for \"Hotch Potch\", calling for neck of mutton, onion, carrot, peas, cauliflower and lettuce.\n\n\n"}

Modern methods use an industrial food processor to produce large quantities for retail distribution. Freshly pounded taro without the addition of water is \"pa‘i ‘ai\" and is highly starchy and dough-like. Water is added to the \"pa‘i ‘ai\" during mashing and again just before eating to achieve the desired consistency, which can range from highly viscous to liquid. As such, poi can be known as \"one-finger,\" \"two-finger,\" or \"three-finger\" poi depending on the consistency, alluding to how many fingers are required to scoop it up in order to eat it (the thicker the poi, the fewer fingers required to scoop a sufficient mouthful). Poi can be eaten immediately when fresh and sweet, or left a bit longer to ferment.\n\nPoi made from taro should not be confused with\n\nTaro, a root vegetable and the primary poi ingredient, was highly regarded by Hawaiians, who believed that the taro plant, or \"kalo\", was the original ancestor of the Hawaiian people. Poi was considered such an important and sacred aspect of daily Hawaiian life that it was believed that the spirit of Hāloa, the legendary ancestor of the Hawaiian people, was present when a bowl of poi was uncovered for consumption at the family dinner table. Accordingly, all conflict among family members was required to come to an immediate halt.\n\nAlthough many of the world's people consume taro, only Hawaiians make poi. Hawaiians traditionally cook the starchy, potato-like heart of the taro root for hours in an underground oven called an \"imu\". An \"imu\" is also used to cook other types of food such as pork, carrots and sweet potatoes.\n\nIn recent years, taro-production shortages (resulting from pests and labor shortages) have resulted in higher prices for poi in Hawaii. At the same time, innovations in poi production have resulted in poi that stays fresh longer and tastes sweeter. However, such products generally sell at a premium price and require refrigeration.\n\nPoi has a paste-like texture and a delicate flavor, with a pale purple color that derives from that of the taro corm. The flavor changes distinctly once the poi has been made. Fresh poi is sweet and edible all by itself. Each day thereafter the poi loses sweetness and turns slightly sour, due to a natural fermentation that involves lactobacillus, yeast, and Geotrichum. Therefore, some people find poi more palatable if it is mixed with milk and/or sugar. The speed of this fermentation process depends upon the bacteria level in the poi. To slow the souring process, poi can be stored in a cool, dark location. Commercial poi stored in a refrigerator can be squeezed out of the bag into a bowl, and a thin layer of water drizzled over the top to keep a crust from forming.\n\nSour poi is still edible, and is usually served with salted fish or lomi salmon on the side. Sourness is prevented by freezing or dehydrating, although the resulting poi tends to be bland in comparison to the fresh product. Sour poi is also used as a cooking ingredient, usually in breads and rolls. It has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.\n\nTaro is low in fat, high in vitamin A, and abounds in complex carbohydrates.\n\nPoi has been used as a milk substitute or baby food for babies. It contains no gluten, and as such is safe for ingestion by people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "207393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207393", "title": "Jump cut", "text": "Jump cut\n\nA jump cut is a cut in film editing in which two sequential shots of the same subject are taken from camera positions that vary only slightly if at all. This type of edit gives the effect of jumping forwards in time. It is a manipulation of temporal space using the duration of a single shot, and fracturing the duration to move the audience ahead. This kind of cut abruptly communicates the passing of time as opposed to the more seamless dissolve heavily used in films predating Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\", when jump cuts were first used extensively. For this reason, jump cuts, while not seen as inherently bad, are considered a violation of classical continuity editing, which aims to give the appearance of continuous time and space in the story-world by de-emphasizing editing. Jump cuts, in contrast, draw attention to the constructed nature of the film.\n\nContinuity editing uses a guideline called the \"30 degree rule\" to avoid jump cuts. The 30 degree rule advises that for consecutive shots to appear seamless, the camera position must vary at least 30 degrees from its previous position. Some schools would call for a change in framing as well (e.g., from a medium shot to a close up). Generally, if the camera position changes less than 30 degrees, the difference between the two shots will not be substantial enough, and the viewer will experience the edit as a jump in the position of the subject that is jarring, and draws attention to itself. Although jump cuts can be created through the editing together of two shots filmed non-continuously (spatial jump cuts), they can also be created by removing a middle section of one continuously filmed shot (temporal jump cuts).\n\nJump cuts can add a sense of speed to the sequence of events.\n\nGeorges Méliès is known as the father of the jump cut as a result of having discovered it accidentally, and then using it to simulate magical tricks; however, he tried to make the cut appear seamless to complement his illusions. Dziga Vertof's \"avant-garde\" Russian film \"Man With a Movie Camera\" (1929) is almost entirely composed of jump cuts. Contemporary use of the jump cut stems from its appearance in the work of Jean-Luc Godard (at the suggestion of Jean-Pierre Melville) and other filmmakers of the French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s. In Godard's ground-breaking \"Breathless\" (1960), for example, he cut together shots of Jean Seberg riding in a convertible (see image) in such a way that the discontinuity between shots is emphasized and its jarring effect deliberate. In the screen shots to the right, the first image comes from the very end of one shot and the second is the very beginning of the next shot—thus emphasizing the gap in action between the two (when Seberg picked up the mirror). Recently the jump cut has been used in films like \"Snatch\", by Guy Ritchie, and \"Run Lola Run\", by Tom Tykwer. It is frequently used in TV editing, in documentaries produced by Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel (NatGeo), for example. It is noticeable in Universal Monsters films and music videos.\n\nThe jump cut has sometimes served a political use in film. It has been used as an alienating Brechtian technique (the \"Verfremdungseffekt\") that makes the audience aware of the unreality of the film experience, in order to focus the audience's attention on the political message of a film rather than the drama or emotion of the narrative—as may be observed in some segments of Sergei Eisenstein's \"The Battleship Potemkin\".\n\nIt was also used in Alexander Dovzhenko's \"Arsenal\" (Soviet Union, 1930), where a close-up shot of a character's face cuts closer and closer a total of nine times. Mark Cousins comments that this \"fragmentation captured his indecision... and confusion\", adding that \"Although the effect jars, the idea of visual conflict was central to Soviet montage cinema of that time\".\n\nJump cuts are sometimes used to show a nervous searching scene, as is done in the 2009 science fiction film \"Moon\" in which the protagonist, Sam Bell, is looking for a secret room on a moon base, and \"District 9\" in which the protagonist, Wikus, searches for illegal objects in the house of Christopher's friend.\n\nIn television, \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the jump cut. Jump cutting remained an uncommon TV technique until shows like \"\" popularized it on the small screen in the 1990s.\n\nThe well-remembered music video for \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\" has a jump cut for virtually every frame.\n\nOther uses of the jump cuts include Vincent Gallo's short \"Flying Christ\" in which various shots of \"Christ\" jumping are cut together as he is in mid jump, creating the illusion of flight, and in many vlogs online, as popularized by the show with zefrank.\n\nBritish comedian Russell Kane has produced a series of comic, satirical videos, named \"Kaneings\", in response to current events. These make extensive use of jump cut-style editing.\n\nVernacular use of the term \"jump cut\" can describe any abrupt or noticeable edit in a film. However, technically, many such over-broad usages are incorrect. In particular, a cut between two different subjects is not a true jump cut, no matter how jarring.\n\nA \"match cut\" (a.k.a. graphic match) may also be abrupt, but the viewer is meant to see the similarity between two scenes with disparate subjects rather than experience the discontinuity between the two shots. A well-known example is found at the end of the \"Dawn of Man\" sequence in the film \"\". A primitive hominid discovers the use of a bone as a weapon and throws it into the air. When the bone reaches its highest point, the shot cuts to that of a similarly shaped space station in orbit above the earth. This edit has been described as a jump cut by those unfamiliar with film editing terminology (even on the box of the DVD release of the film), but it is properly termed a \"graphic match\" or a \"match cut.\" \n\nJump cuts are also distinguishable from an \"impossible match on action\" (a.k.a. impossible continuous action), where the action of the subject seems continuous and fluid but the background suddenly changes in an impossible way. Several of the cuts, sometimes mislabeled jump cuts, in the \"Patricia in the car\" sequence from Godard's \"Breathless\" are actually examples of impossible match on action. ( Contradicts \"example illustrated above ? )\" Other infamous examples include Resnais' \"Last Year in Marienbad\", the \"air mattress to Mrs. Robinson\" cut in \"The Graduate\", and the very last cut in \"Pal Joey\" where Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak instantly walk from a street in San Francisco to a location with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\n"}

A large weapon, the arbalest had a steel prod (\"bow\"). Since the arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. However, the greater draw weight was offset by the smaller powerstroke, which limited its potential in fully transferring the energy into the crossbow bolt. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) of force and be accurate up to 100 m. A skilled arbalestier (arbalester) could loose two bolts per minute.\n\nThe term \"arbalest\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"crossbow\". \n\"Arbalest\" is a Medieval French word originating from the Roman name ' (from ' 'bow' + \" 'missile-throwing engine'), which was then used for crossbows, although originally used for types of artillery. \nModern French uses the word \", which is linguistically one step further from the stem (disappearance of the \"s\" phoneme in the last syllable, before \"t\"). \n\nThe word applies to both crossbow and arbalest (the latter may be referred to as a \"heavy crossbow\", but an actual heavy crossbow may not be the same as an arbalest).

The mints are stocked in Morrisons. Marks & Spencer produces a near identical product called \"Curiously Strong Mints\".

Callard & Bowser-Suchard once manufactured Altoids at a plant in Bridgend, Wales, but has since moved Altoids' production to an existing plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States. This was done to manufacture the products closer to where they are primarily marketed. They were marketed for a brief period in the 1990s under the \"Nuttall's\" brand when Callard and Bowser was under the ownership of Terry's.\n\nAltoids mints are available in four flavours: peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint, and cinnamon. \"Sugar-Free Smalls\", tiny square mints sweetened with sorbitol and sucralose, are also available in peppermint, wintergreen, and cinnamon. In 2007, dark chocolate-dipped mints were introduced in three flavours: peppermint, cinnamon and ginger and in 2008, dark chocolate-dipped mints were introduced in crème de menthe. The chocolate dipped varieties were discontinued in 2010. Also historically made but no longer available were liquorice, cool honey, and (non-chocolate dipped) ginger and crème de menthe varieties. Circa early 2011, Altoids altered the ingredients of their Wintergreen mints, adding blue food colouring. Altoid mints labeled \"sugar-free smalls\" contain gelatin.\n\nSour hard sweets in round tins were introduced in 2004 but were discontinued in 2010 due to low sales. Flavours included raspberry, citrus, apple, tangerine, and mango. Limited edition passion fruit sours were also released around Valentine's Day in 2005 in a larger 2.3 oz tin instead of the standard 1.76 oz sours tins that had been released up until then.\n\nThe sugar-free chewing gum, introduced in 2003, was made in the United States. Flavours include peppermint, cinnamon, spearmint, wintergreen and two sour flavours, cherry and apple. The gum has not been seen in stock in US stores since January 2010 and has been discontinued.\n\nIn 2003, breath strips in peppermint and cinnamon flavours were introduced. They were discontinued and are no longer available.\n\nIn 2014, Eclipse Mints, another Wrigley product, were rebranded as Altoids Arctic, with the tin remaining identical save for labeling. The rebranded mints were released in only Peppermint, Wintergreen, and Strawberry, doing away with the wider varieties of Eclipse such as Cinnamon, Winterfrost and several other flavors, as well as the chewables. As before, each tin contains 1.2 oz (34g), or about 50 mints.\n\nThe distinctive tin cases, in which Altoids mints are packaged, are often reused for other purposes. They have long served as containers for household items like paper clips, coins, sewing materials and other small items.\n\nThe tins are sometimes used to house electronic projects. BeagleBone, a single-board computer made by Texas Instruments, is deliberately shaped with rounded corners to fit inside the tin. The CMoy pocket headphone amplifiers also often use Altoid tins as an enclosure. A Retrocomputing hobbyist computer, the RCA 1802-based Membership Card microcomputer kit, is designed to fit in an Altoids tin. In 2018, Aden Shank even converted an Altoids tin into the smallest-ever functional homemade portable video game system that could play GameCube and Wii games in short sessions.\n\nAltoids tins have also been popular with outdoor enthusiasts for many years as first-aid or mini survival kit containers. A name for these kits is \"Bug-Out Altoids Tins\", or \"BOATs\".\n\nIn Darden Case No. UVA-M-0705 Altoids sales numbers are referenced and compared to Listerine breath strips. In the year 2000 Altoids achieved sales of $107 million and shortly declined to $90 million in sales revenue after only two years. The decline in sales is in part due to the success of PocketPaks breath strips which produced $110 million in sales revenue in less than a year.\n\nIn 2007 at the grand opening of The New Museum of Contemporary Art Altoids announced the biennial Altoids Award. A cash prize of $25,000 is awarded to four individual artists from around the country. Winners have their art exhibited at the museum after the rigorous selection process is completed. The first winners were chosen by Paul McCarthy, Cindy Sherman, and Rirkrit Tiravanija.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "209717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209717", "title": "Madrasa", "text": "Madrasa\n\nMadrasa (, \",\" pl. , \"\") is the Arabic word for any type of educational institution, secular or religious (of any religion), whether for elementary instruction or higher learning. The word is variously transliterated \"madrasah\", \"medresa\", \"madrassa\", \"madraza\", \"medrese\", etc. In the West, the word usually refers to a specific type of religious school or college for the study of the Islamic religion, though this may not be the only subject studied.\nThe word ' derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س \"D-R-S\" 'to learn, study', through the \"wazn\" (form/stem) ; , meaning \"a place where something is done\". Therefore, ' literally means \"a place where learning and studying take place\". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian. In the Arabic language, the word \"\" simply means the same as \"school\" does in the English language, whether that is private, public or parochial school, as well as for any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike the use of the word \"school\" in British English, the word ' more closely resembles the term \"school\" in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as \"danişmends\". The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is \" ()\". The Hebrew cognate \"midrasha\" also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term \"midrash\" literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.\n\nHowever, in English, the term ' usually refers to the specifically Islamic institutions. A typical Islamic school usually offers two courses of study: a ' course teaching memorization of the Qur'an (the person who commits the entire Qur'an to memory is called a ); and an course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community. A regular curriculum includes courses in Arabic, \"tafsir\" (Qur'anic interpretation), (Islamic law), hadiths (recorded sayings and deeds of Muhammad), mantiq (logic), and Muslim history. In the Ottoman Empire, during the Early Modern Period, the study of hadiths was introduced by Süleyman I. Depending on the educational demands, some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in Arabic literature, English and other foreign languages, as well as science and world history. Ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught \"styles of writing, grammary, syntax, poetry, composition, natural sciences, political sciences, and etiquette.\"\n\nPeople of all ages attend, and many often move on to becoming imams. The certificate of an \"ʻālim\", for example, requires approximately twelve years of study. A good number of the \"ḥuffāẓ\" (plural of \"ḥāfiẓ\") are the product of the madaris. The madaris also resemble colleges, where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories. An important function of the madaris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training. Madaris may enroll female students; however, they study separately from the men.\n\nThe term \"Islamic education\" means education in the light of Islam itself, which is rooted in the teachings of the Qur'an - the holy book of the Muslims. Islamic education and Muslim education are not the same. Because Islamic education has epistemological integration which is founded on Tawhid - Oneness or monotheism.\n\nThe first institute of madrasa education was at the estate of Zaid bin Arkam near a hill called Safa, where Muhammad was the teacher and the students were some of his followers. After Hijrah (migration) the madrasa of \"Suffa\" was established in Madina on the east side of the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque. Ubada ibn as-Samit was appointed there by Muhammad as teacher and among the students. In the curriculum of the madrasa, there were teachings of The Qur'an, The Hadith, fara'iz, tajweed, genealogy, treatises of first aid, etc. There were also trainings of horse-riding, art of war, handwriting and calligraphy, athletics and martial arts. The first part of madrasa based education is estimated from the first day of \"nabuwwat\" to the first portion of the Umayyad Caliphate.\n\nEstablished in 859, (located in Mosque) in the city of Fas, Morocco, is considered the oldest university in the world by some scholars, though the existence of universities in the medieval Muslim world is debated. It was founded by , the daughter of a wealthy merchant named . This was later followed by the establishment of al-Azhar in 959 in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nDuring the late ʻAbbāsid period, the Seljuk vizier created one of the first major official academic institutions known in history as the , based on the informal ' (sessions of the shaykhs). , who would later be murdered by the Assassins ('), created a system of state madaris (in his time they were called the Niẓāmiyyahs, named after him) in various ʻAbbāsid cities at the end of the 11th century.\nDuring the rule of the Fatimid and Mamluk dynasties and their successor states in the medieval Middle East, many of the ruling elite founded madaris through a religious endowment known as the waqf. Not only was the madrasa a potent symbol of status but it was an effective means of transmitting wealth and status to their descendants. Especially during the Mamluk period, when only former slaves could assume power, the sons of the ruling elite were unable to inherit. Guaranteed positions within the new madaris thus allowed them to maintain status. Madaris built in this period include the Mosque- of Sultan in Cairo.\n\nDimitri Gutas and the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the \"Golden Age\" of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by al-Ghazali's successful integration of logic into the curriculum and the subsequent rise of Avicennism.\n\nAt the beginning of the Caliphate or Islamic Empire, the reliance on courts initially confined sponsorship and scholarly activities to major centres. Within several centuries, the development of Muslim educational institutions such as the \"\" and \"masjid\" eventually introduced such activities to provincial towns and dispersed them across the Islamic legal schools and Sufi orders. In addition to religious subjects, they also taught the \"rational sciences,\" as varied as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, geography, alchemy, philosophy, magic, and occultism, depending on the curriculum of the specific institution in question. The madaris, however, were not centres of advanced scientific study; scientific advances in Islam were usually carried out by scholars working under the patronage of royal courts. During the Islamic Golden Age, the Caliphate experienced a growth in literacy, having the highest literacy rate of the Middle Ages, comparable to classical Athens' literacy in antiquity but on a much larger scale. The emergence of the maktab and madrasa institutions played a fundamental role in the relatively high literacy rates of the medieval Islamic world.\n\nThe following excerpt provides a brief synopsis of the historical origins and starting points for the teachings that took place in the Ottoman madaris in the Early Modern Period:\n\nIn the medieval Islamic world, an elementary school was known as a ', which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like madaris (which referred to higher education), a was often attached to an endowed mosque. In the 11th century, the famous Persian Islamic philosopher and teacher (known as \"Avicenna\" in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter about the ' entitled \"The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children,\" as a guide to teachers working at ' schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in classes instead of individual tuition from private tutors, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of competition and emulation among pupils, as well as the usefulness of group discussions and debates. described the curriculum of a ' school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a \" school.\n\n wrote that children should be sent to a \" school from the age of 6 and be taught primary education until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote, they should be taught the Qur'an, Islamic metaphysics, Arabic, literature, Islamic ethics, and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).\n\n refers to the secondary education stage of \" schooling as a period of specialisation when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be allowed to choose and specialise in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, medicine, geometry, trade and commerce, craftsmanship, or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future career. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.\n\nDuring its formative period, the term \" referred to a higher education institution, whose curriculum initially included only the \"religious sciences\", whilst philosophy and the secular sciences were often excluded. The curriculum slowly began to diversify, with many later madaris teaching both the religious and the \"secular sciences\", such as logic, mathematics and philosophy. Some madaris further extended their curriculum to history, politics, ethics, music, metaphysics, medicine, astronomy and chemistry. The curriculum of a was usually set by its founder, but most generally taught both the religious sciences and the physical sciences. Madaris were established throughout the Islamic world, examples being the 9th century University of al-Qarawiyyin, the 10th century al-Azhar University (the most famous), the 11th century , as well as 75 madaris in Cairo, 51 in Damascus and up to 44 in Aleppo between 1155 and 1260. Many more were also established in the Andalusian cities of Córdoba, Seville, Toledo, Granada (Madrasah of Granada), Murcia, Almería, Valencia and Cádiz during the Caliphate of Córdoba.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire during the early modern period, \"Madaris were divided into lower and specialised levels, which reveals that there was a sense of elevation in school. Students who studied in the specialised schools after completing courses in the lower levels became known as \"danişmends\".\"\n\nWhile \"\" can now refer to any type of school, the term \"\" was originally used to refer more specifically to a medieval Islamic centre of learning, mainly teaching Islamic law and theology, usually affiliated with a mosque, and funded by an early charitable trust known as \"waqf\".\n\nMadaris were largely centred on the study of ' (Islamic jurisprudence). The \"\" (\"licence to teach and issue legal opinions\") in the medieval Islamic legal education system had its origins in the 9th century after the formation of the \"\" (schools of jurisprudence). George Makdisi considers the ' to be the origin of the European doctorate. However, in an earlier article, he considered the ' to be of \"fundamental difference\" to the medieval doctorate, since the former was awarded by an individual teacher-scholar not obliged to follow any formal criteria, whereas the latter was conferred on the student by the collective authority of the faculty. To obtain an ', a student \"had to study in a guild school of law, usually four years for the basic undergraduate course\" and ten or more years for a post-graduate course. The \"doctorate was obtained after an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate's theses\", and to test the student's \"ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.\" These were scholarly exercises practised throughout the student's \"career as a graduate student of law.\" After students completed their post-graduate education, they were awarded \"ijaza\"s giving them the status of \"\" 'scholar of jurisprudence', \"\" 'scholar competent in issuing fatwās', and \"\" 'teacher'.\nThe Arabic term ' was awarded to Islamic scholars who were qualified to teach. According to Makdisi, the Latin title \"licentia docendi\" 'licence to teach' in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic, but the underlying concept was very different. A significant difference between the ' and the \"licentia docendi\" was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher, while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the individual scholar-teacher.\n\nMuch of the study in the college centred on examining whether certain opinions of law were orthodox. This scholarly process of \"determining orthodoxy began with a question which the Muslim layman, called in that capacity \"\", presented to a jurisconsult, called \"mufti\", soliciting from him a response, called \"fatwa\", a legal opinion (the religious law of Islam covers civil as well as religious matters). The \"mufti\" (professor of legal opinions) took this question, studied it, researched it intensively in the sacred scriptures, in order to find a solution to it. This process of scholarly research was called \"\", literally, the exertion of one's efforts to the utmost limit.\"\n\nThough Islamic medicine was most often taught at the bimaristan teaching hospitals, there were also several medical madaris dedicated to the teaching of medicine. For example, of the 155 madrasa colleges in 15th century Damascus, three of them were medical schools.\n\nToby Huff argues that no medical degrees were granted to students, as there was no faculty that could issue them, and that, therefore, no system of examination and certification developed in the Islamic tradition like that of medieval Europe. However, the historians Andrew C. Miller, Nigel J. Shanks and Dawshe Al-Kalai point out that, during this era, physician licensure became mandatory in the Abbasid Caliphate. In 931 AD, Caliph Al-Muqtadir learned of the death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician's error. He immediately ordered his muhtasib Sinan ibn Thabit to examine and prevent doctors from practicing until they passed an examination. From this time on, licensing exams were required and only qualified physicians were allowed to practice medicine.\n\nIn the Early Modern Period in the Ottoman Empire, \"Suleyman I added new curriculums ['sic'] to the Ottoman medreses of which one was medicine, which alongside studying of the was given highest rank.\"\n\nScholars like Arnold H. Green and Seyyed Hossein Nasr have argued that, starting in the 10th century, some medieval Islamic madaris indeed became universities. However, scholars like George Makdisi, Toby Huff and Norman Daniel argue that the European medieval university has no parallel in the medieval Islamic world. Darleen Pryds questions this view, pointing out that madaris and European universities in the Mediterranean region shared similar foundations by princely patrons and were intended to provide loyal administrators to further the rulers' agenda. A number of scholars regard the university as uniquely European in origin and characteristics. According to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", however, the earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa, predating the first European medieval universities.\n\nUniversity in Fez, Morocco is recognised by many historians as the oldest degree-granting university in the world, having been founded in 859 by Fatima al-Fihri. While the madrasa college could also issue degrees at all levels, the \"jāmiʻah\"s (such as and al-Azhar University) differed in the sense that they were larger institutions, more universal in terms of their complete source of studies, had individual faculties for different subjects, and could house a number of mosques, madaris, and other institutions within them. Such an institution has thus been described as an \"Islamic university\".\n\nAl-Azhar University, founded in Cairo, Egypt in 975 by the Ismaʻīlī Shīʻī Fatimid dynasty as a ', had individual faculties for a theological seminary, Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy and logic in Islamic philosophy. The postgraduate doctorate in law was only obtained after \"an oral examination to determine the originality of the candidate's theses\", and to test the student's \"ability to defend them against all objections, in disputations set up for the purpose.\" ‘Abd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī also delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at al-Azhar, while Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin. Another early ' was the Niẓāmīyah of Baghdād (founded 1091), which has been called the \"largest university of the Medieval world.\" Mustansiriya University, established by the ʻAbbāsid caliph al-Mustanṣir in 1233, in addition to teaching the religious subjects, offered courses dealing with philosophy, mathematics and the natural sciences.\n\nHowever, the classification of madaris as \"universities\" is disputed on the question of understanding of each institution on its own terms. In madaris, the \"ijāzahs\" were only issued in one field, the Islamic religious law of , and in no other field of learning. Other academic subjects, including the natural sciences, philosophy and literary studies, were only treated \"ancillary\" to the study of the Sharia. For example, a natural science like astronomy was only studied (if at all) to supply religious needs, like the time for prayer. This is why Ptolemaic astronomy was considered adequate, and is still taught in some modern day madaris. The Islamic law undergraduate degree from al-Azhar, the most prestigious madrasa, was traditionally granted without final examinations, but on the basis of the students' attentive attendance to courses. In contrast to the medieval doctorate which was granted by the collective authority of the faculty, the Islamic degree was not granted by the teacher to the pupil based on any formal criteria, but remained a \"personal matter, the sole prerogative of the person bestowing it; no one could force him to give one\".\n\nMedievalist specialists who define the university as a legally autonomous corporation disagree with the term \"university\" for the Islamic madaris and \"jāmi‘ah\"s because the medieval university (from Latin \"universitas\") was structurally different, being a legally autonomous corporation rather than a \"waqf\" institution like the madrasa and '. Despite the many similarities, medieval specialists have coined the term \"Islamic college\" for madrasa and ' to differentiate them from the legally autonomous corporations that the medieval European universities were. In a sense, the madrasa resembles a university college in that it has most of the features of a university, but lacks the corporate element. Toby Huff summarises the difference as follows: As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a \"spurt\" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula.\n\nThe madrasa of , one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the \"first universities\" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as 1947. The other, al-Azhar, did acquire this status in name and essence only in the course of numerous reforms during the 19th and 20th century, notably the one of 1961 which introduced non-religious subjects to its curriculum, such as economics, engineering, medicine, and agriculture. It should also be noted that many medieval universities were run for centuries as Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools prior to their formal establishment as \"universitas scholarium\"; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the university dates back to the 6th century AD, thus well preceding the earliest madaris. George Makdisi, who has published most extensively on the topic concludes in his comparison between the two institutions: \n\nNevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including \"the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'chairman' of their subject\" being based on the \"traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him\", the term 'academic circles' being derived from the way in which Islamic students \"sat in a circle around their professor\", and terms such as \"having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back\" to the Islamic concepts of ' ('companions, as of Muhammad'), ' ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and \"\" ('licence [to teach]') respectively. Makdisi has listed eighteen such parallels in terminology which can be traced back to their roots in Islamic education. Some of the practices now common in modern universities which Makdisi and Goddard trace back to an Islamic root include \"practices such as delivering inaugural lectures, wearing academic robes, obtaining doctorates by defending a thesis, and even the idea of academic freedom are also modelled on Islamic custom.\" The Islamic scholarly system of \"\" and \"\", meaning opinion and consensus respectively, formed the basis of the \"scholarly system the West has practised in university scholarship from the Middle Ages down to the present day.\" According to Makdisi and Goddard, \"the idea of academic freedom\" in universities was also \"modelled on Islamic custom\" as practised in the medieval Madrasa system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was \"certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university\" in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II founded by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1224.\n\nHowever, all of these facets of medieval university life are considered by standard scholarship to be independent medieval European developments with no tracable Islamic influence. Generally, some reviewers have pointed out the strong inclination of Makdisi of overstating his case by simply resting on \"the accumulation of close parallels\", but all the while failing to point to convincing channels of transmission between the Muslim and Christian world. Norman Daniel points out that the Arab equivalent of the Latin disputation, the taliqa, was reserved for the ruler's court, not the madrasa, and that the actual differences between Islamic fiqh and medieval European civil law were profound. The taliqa only reached Islamic Spain, the only likely point of transmission, after the establishment of the first medieval universities. In fact, there is no Latin translation of the taliqa and, most importantly, no evidence of Latin scholars ever showing awareness of Arab influence on the Latin method of disputation, something they would have certainly found noteworthy. Rather, it was the medieval reception of the Greek Organon which set the scholastic sic et non in motion. Daniel concludes that resemblances in method had more to with the two religions having \"common problems: to reconcile the conflicting statements of their own authorities, and to safeguard the data of revelation from the impact of Greek philosophy\"; thus Christian scholasticism and similar Arab concepts should be viewed in terms of a parallel occurrence, not of the transmission of ideas from one to the other, a view shared by Hugh Kennedy.\n\nToby Huff, in a discussion of Makdisi's hypothesis, argues:\nGeorge Saliba criticized Huff's views regarding the legal autonomy of European universities and limited curriculum of Madrasahs, demonstrating that there were many Madrasahs dedicated to the teaching of non-religious subjects and arguing that Madrasahs generally had greater legal autonomy than medieval European universities. According to Saliba, Madrasahs \"were fully protected from interference in their curriculum by the very endowments that established them in the first place.\" Examples include the Dakhwariyya madrasah in Damascus, which was dedicated to medicine, a subject also taught at Islamic hospitals; the Madrasah established by Kamal al-Din Ibn Man`a (d. 1242) in Mosul which taught astronomy, music, and the Old the New Testaments; Ulugh Beg’s Madrasah in Samarqand which taught astronomy; and Shi`i madrasahs in Iran which taught astronomy along with religious studies. According to Saliba:\n\nPrior to the 12th century, women accounted for less than one percent of the world’s Islamic scholars. However, al-Sakhawi and Mohammad Akram Nadwi have since found evidence of over 8,000 female scholars since the 15th century. al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary \"\" to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them. More recently, the scholar Mohammad Akram Nadwi, currently a researcher from the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, has written 40 volumes on the (the women scholars of hadith), and found at least 8,000 of them.\n\nFrom around 750, during the Abbasid Caliphate, women \"became renowned for their brains as well as their beauty\". In particular, many well known women of the time were trained from childhood in music, dancing and poetry. Mahbuba was one of these. Another feminine figure to be remembered for her achievements was Tawaddud, \"a slave girl who was said to have been bought at great cost by because she had passed her examinations by the most eminent scholars in astronomy, medicine, law, philosophy, music, history, Arabic grammar, literature, theology and chess\". Moreover, among the most prominent feminine figures was Shuhda who was known as \"the Scholar\" or \"the Pride of Women\" during the 12th century in Baghdad. Despite the recognition of women's aptitudes during the Abbasid dynasty, all these came to an end in Iraq with the sack of Baghdad in 1258.\n\nWomen played an important role in the foundations of many Islamic educational institutions, such as Fatima al-Fihri's founding of the University of Al Karaouine in 859. This continued through to the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques and madaris were established in Damascus, 26 of which were funded by women through the Waqf (charitable trust) system. Half of all the royal patrons for these institutions were also women.\n\nAccording to the Sunni scholar in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education in the medieval Islamic world, writing that women could study, earn \"ijazahs\" (academic degrees), and qualify as scholars and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters. Ibn ʻAsakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by Muhammad's wives, such as Khadijah, a successful businesswoman, and 'A'isha, a strong leader and interpreter of the Prophet's actions. According to a hadith attributed both to Muhammad and 'A'isha, the women of Medina were praiseworthy because of their desire for religious knowledge:\n\nWhile it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal classes, it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madaris and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time:\n\nThe term \"\" is often translated as 'that which is indecent', which usually meant the exposure of anything other than a woman's face and hands, although scholarly interpretations of the \"\" and have always tended to vary, with some more or less strict than others.\n\n\"The first Ottoman Medrese was created in İznik in 1331 and most Ottoman medreses followed the traditions of Sunni Islam.\" \"When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, Murad II brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance the reputation of the Ottoman medrese\". This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: \"Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.\"\nİnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of \"schooling\" was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built \"on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.\" The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.\nThis is the rank of madaris in the Ottoman Empire from the highest ranking to the lowest: (From İnalcık, 167).\n\nAlthough Ottoman madaris had a number of different branches of study, such as calligraphic sciences, oral sciences, and intellectual sciences, they primarily served the function of an Islamic centre for spiritual learning. \"The goal of all knowledge and in particular, of the spiritual sciences is knowledge of God.\" Religion, for the most part, determines the significance and importance of each science. As İnalcık mentions: \"Those which aid religion are good and sciences like astrology are bad.\"\nHowever, even though mathematics, or studies in logic were part of the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. \"The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths\" – key word being \"divine\". İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam.\" Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe \"Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah.\" Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach \"proper religious values.\" This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools in the sense that they offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.\n\nAs is previously mentioned, religion dominated much of the knowledge and teachings that were endowed upon students. \"Religious learning as the only true science, whose sole aim was the understanding of God's word.\" Thus, it is important to keep this impulse in mind when going over the curriculum that was taught.\n\nThe following is taken from İnalcık.\n\nAs with any other country during the Early Modern Period, such as Italy and Spain in Europe, the Ottoman social life was interconnected with the medrese. Medreses were built in as part of a Mosque complex where many programmes, such as aid to the poor through soup kitchens, were held under the infrastructure of a mosque, which reveals the interconnectedness of religion and social life during this period. \"The mosques to which medreses were attached, dominated the social life in Ottoman cities.\" Social life was not dominated by religion only in the Muslim world of the Ottoman Empire; it was also quite similar to the social life of Europe during this period. As Goffman says: \"Just as mosques dominated social life for the Ottomans, churches and synagogues dominated life for the Christians and Jews as well.\" Hence, social life and the medrese were closely linked, since medreses taught many curricula, such as religion, which highly governed social life in terms of establishing orthodoxy. \"They tried moving their developing state toward Islamic orthodoxy.\" Overall, the fact that mosques contained medreses comes to show the relevance of education to religion in the sense that education took place within the framework of religion and religion established social life by trying to create a common religious orthodoxy. Hence, medreses were simply part of the social life of society as students came to learn the fundamentals of their societal values and beliefs.\n\nThere are three different madrasa education systems in Bangladesh: the original darse nizami system, the redesigned nizami system, and the higher syllabus alia nisab. The first two categories are commonly called Qawmi or non-government madaris. Amongst them the most notable are Al-Jamiatul Ahlia Darul Ulum Moinul Islam in Hathazari, Al-Jamiah Al-Islamiah Patiya, in Patiya, and Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah in Sylhet.\n\nIn 2006 there were 15,000 registered Qawmi madaris with the Befaqul Mudarressin of Bangladesh Qawmi Madrasah Education Board, though the figure could be well over double that number if unregistered madaris were counted.\n\nIn India the majority of these schools follow the Hanafi school of thought. The religious establishment forms part of the mainly two large divisions within the country, namely the Deobandis, who dominate in numbers (of whom the Darul Uloom Deoband constitutes one of the biggest madaris) and the Barelvis, who also make up a sizeable portion (Sufi-oriented). Some notable establishments include: Al Jamiatul Ashrafia, Mubarakpur, Manzar Islam Bareilly, Jamia Nizamdina New Delhi, Jamia Nayeemia Muradabad which is one of the largest learning centres for the Barelvis. The HR ministry of the government of India has recently declared that a Central Madrasa Board would be set up. This will enhance the education system of madaris in India. Though the madaris impart Quranic education mainly, efforts are on to include Mathematics, Computers and science in the curriculum.\nIn July 2015, the state government of Maharashtra created a stir de-recognised madrasa education, receiving critisicm from several political parties with the NCP accusing the ruling BJP of creating Hindu-Muslim friction in the state, and Kamal Farooqui of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board saying it was \"ill-designed\"\nAfter the establishment of the British Raj and the emergence of Darul Ulum Manazar-e Islam Bareilly Sharif, Indian Muslim Scholars left India to establish madaris in other regions of the world. Some of the most notable of these madaris are Darul Ulum Holocombe, which produced scholars such as Shaikh Ibrahim Memon Madani, or Darul Uloom Al-Madania. These offshoot schools symbolise an emotional drive based upon both religion and patriotism that is not evident elsewhere.\n\nThe Arabic and Islamic educational system has also become a channel for employment in the Middle East in modern times in Kerala. Originating in 8th century madaris for primary children, Arabic and Islamic schooling in Kerala was patronised and funded by the British colonial government.\n\nToday, the system of Arabic and Islamic education has grown and further integrated with Kerala government administration. In 2005, an estimated 6,000 Muslim Arabic teachers taught in Kerala government schools, with over 500,000 Muslim students. State-appointed committees, not private mosques or religious scholars outside the government, determine the curriculum and accreditation of new schools and colleges. Primary education in Arabic and Islamic studies is available to Kerala Muslims almost entirely in after-school madrasa programs - sharply unlike full-time madaris common in north India, which may replace formal schooling. Arabic colleges (over eleven of which exist within the state-run University of Calicut and the Kannur University) provide B.A. and Masters' level degrees. At all levels, instruction is co-educational, with many women instructors and professors. Islamic education boards are independently run by the following organizations, accredited by the Kerala state government: Samastha Kerala Islamic Education Board, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.\n\nWith Malayalam rather than Urdu as the lingua franca of Kerala Muslims, these madaris and colleges are relatively unknown and unlinked from Urdu-based madaris in the rest of India, due to the linguistic barrier.\n\nThe madaris rose as colleges of learning in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier. They catered not only to the religious establishment, though that was the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one. To the latter they supplied physicians, administrative officials, judges and teachers. Even to this day many Registered madaris are Working effectively and coping up with Modern Education System such as Jamia-tul-Madina which is a chain of Islamic schools in Pakistan and in European and other countries established by Dawat-e-Islami. The Jamia-tul-Madina are also known as Faizan-e-Madina. Dawat-e-Islami has grown its network of Madaris from Pakistan to Europe.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Muslim students have a choice of attending a secular government or an Islamic school. Madaris or Islamic schools are known as \"Sekolah Agama\" () in Malaysia and Indonesia, โรงเรียนศาสนาอิสลาม () in Thailand and \"madaris\" in the Philippines. In countries where Islam is not the majority or state religion, Islamic schools are found in regions such as southern Thailand (near the Thai-Malaysian border) and the southern Philippines in Mindanao, where a significant Muslim population can be found.\n\nIn Singapore, madrasahs are private schools which are overseen by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS, \"Islamic Religious Council of Singapore\"). There are six Madrasahs in Singapore, catering to students from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 (and junior college equivalent, or \"Pre-U\", at several schools). Four Madrasahs are coeducational and two are for girls. Students take a range of Islamic Studies subjects in addition to mainstream MOE curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE 'O' Levels like their peers. In 2009, MUIS introduced the \"Joint Madrasah System\" (JMS), a joint collaboration of Madrasah Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah primary school and secondary schools Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah (offering the \"ukhrawi\", or religious stream) and Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah (offering the academic stream). The JMS aims to introduce the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme into the Madrasah Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah by 2019. Students attending a madrasah are required to wear the traditional Malay attire, including the songkok for boys and tudong for girls, in contrast to mainstream government schools which ban religious headgear as Singapore is officially a secular state. For students who wish to attend a mainstream school, they may opt to take classes on weekends at the \"madrasah\" instead of enrolling full-time.\n\nIn 2004, madaris were mainstreamed in 16 Regions nationwide, primarily in Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao under the auspices of the Department of Education (DepEd). The DepEd adopted \"Department Order No. 51\", which instituted Arabic-language and Islamic Values instruction for Muslim children in state schools, and authorised implementation of the Standard Madrasa Curriculum (SMC) in private-run madaris. While there are state-recognised Islamic schools, such as Ibn Siena Integrated School in the Islamic City of Marawi, Sarang Bangun LC in Zamboanga and SMIE in Jolo, their Islamic studies programmes initially varied in application and content.\n\nSince 2005, the AusAID-funded DepEd project Basic Education Assistance for Mindanao (BEAM) has assisted a group of private madaris seeking a Permit To Operate from the government and implement the SMC. These private madaris are scattered throughout Regions XI, XII and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.\n\nIn South Africa, the madaris also play a social and cultural role in giving after-school religious instruction to children of Muslims who attend government or private non-religious schools. However, increasing numbers of more affluent Muslims' children attend fully-fledged private Islamic schools, which combine secular and religious education. Among Muslims of Indian origin, madaris also used to provide instruction in Urdu, although this is far less common today than it used to be.\n\nThe first Madressa established in North America, Al-Rashid Islamic Institute, was established in Cornwall, Ontario in 1983 and has graduates who are Hafiz (Quran) and Ulama. The seminary was established by Mazhar Alam under the direction of his teacher the leading Indian Tablighi scholar Muhammad Zakariya Kandhlawi and focuses on the Hanafi school of thought . Due to its proximity to the US border city of Messina the school has historically had a high ratio of US students. Their most prominent graduate Shaykh Muhammad Alshareef completed his Hifz in the early 1990s then went on to form the AlMaghrib Institute.\n\nOn May 26, 2012, Congressman André Carson of Indiana called for additional Madaris in the United States. There is a madrassa in Queens, NY called Shia Ithna-Asheri Jamaat of New York. à It would be Presently, the Darul Uloom in New York City, an affiliate of Darul Uloom Haqqania in Pakistan, also serves as a madrassa.\n\nWestern commentators post-9/11 often perceive madaris as places of radical revivalism with a connotation of anti-Americanism and radical extremism, frequently associated in the Western press with Wahhabi attitudes toward non-Muslims. In Arabic the word \"madrasa\" simply means \"school\" and does not imply a political or religious affiliation, radical or otherwise. Madaris have varied curricula, and are not all religious. Some madaris in India, for example, have a secularised identity. Although early madaris were founded primarily to gain \"knowledge of God\" they also taught subjects such as mathematics and poetry. For example, in the Ottoman Empire, \"Madrasahs had seven categories of sciences that were taught, such as: styles of writing, oral sciences like the Arabic language, grammar, rhetoric, and history and intellectual sciences, such as logic.\" This is similar to the Western world, in which universities began as institutions of the Catholic church.\n\nThe Yale Center for the Study of Globalization examined bias in United States newspaper coverage of Pakistan since the September 11, 2001 attacks, and found the term has come to contain a loaded political meaning:\n\nWhen articles mentioned \"madrassas,\" readers were led to infer that all schools so-named are anti-American, anti-Western, pro-terrorist centres having less to do with teaching basic literacy and more to do with political indoctrination.\n\nVarious American public figures have, in recent times, used the word in a negative context, including Newt Gingrich,\nDonald Rumsfeld, and Colin Powell.\n\"The New York Times\" published in January 2007 a correction for misusing the word \"madrassa\" in a way that assumed it meant a radical Islamic school. The correction stated:\nAn article [...] about a pointed exchange [...] over a Web site report that said Senator Barack Obama had attended an Islamic school or madrassa in Indonesia as a child referred imprecisely to madrassas. While some [madrassas] teach a radical version of Islam, most historically have not.\n\n\n"}

Its main ingredients are: pasta noodles (usually hollow), fish (rockfish, monkfish, cuttlefish, squid), and shellfish (\"Squilla mantis\", shrimp, crayfish). It is seasoned mainly with lemon.\n\nThe invention of fideuà is attributed to a picturesque story. Gabriel Rodriguez Pastor, (\"Gabrielo\" from a kiosk in the port district of Grau in Gandía), worked as a cook in a boat and Juan Bautista Pascual (\"Zábalo\"), was the youngest man in the boat and his assistant. According to Gabriel's family, the boat captain loved rice and the rest of sailors almost never received their full portion of arròs a banda, the dish that the cook usually prepared. Trying to find a solution for the problem, the cook had the idea of using noodles instead of rice to see if the result was a little less appetizing for the captain.\n\nThe invention was liked, and fame of the dish spread though harbor restaurants such as the \"Pastaora House,\" where they cooked the first \"fideuades.\" The dish became distinctive and essential in the area.\n\nJust like paella, it is cooked in a special wide and flat frying pan, also called \"paella\", although there are other traditional variants made in a casserole.\n\nGandia is the birthplace of fideuà, and in this city of La Safor region there is an annual competition-contest where the best cooks try to prepare the best fideuà.\n\nCurrently, various skill competitions for chefs are done in preparing fideuà.\n\n"}
{"id": "210008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210008", "title": "Lao cuisine", "text": "Lao cuisine\n\nLao cuisine is the cuisine of Laos and Northeast Thailand, which is distinct from other Southeast Asian cuisines.\n\nThe staple food of the Lao is steamed sticky rice, which is eaten by hand. In fact, the Lao eat more sticky rice than any other people in the world. Sticky rice is considered the essence of what it means to be Lao. It has been said that no matter where they are in the world, sticky rice will always be the glue that holds the Lao communities together, connecting them to their culture and to Laos. Often the Lao will refer to themselves as \"luk khao niaow\", which can be translated as \"children or descendants of sticky rice\". \n\nThe most famous Lao dish is \"larb\" (; sometimes also spelled \"laap\"), a spicy mixture of marinated meat or fish that is sometimes raw (prepared like \"ceviche\") with a variable combination of herbs, greens, and spices. Another Lao invention is a spicy green papaya salad dish known as \"tam mak hoong\" (), more famously known to the West as \"som tam\".\n\nLao cuisine has many regional variations, corresponding in part to the fresh foods local to each region. A French legacy is still evident in the capital city, Vientiane, where baguettes are sold on the street and French restaurants are common and popular, which were first introduced when Laos was a part of French Indochina.\n\nThe Lao originally came from a northern region that is now part of China. As they moved southward, they brought their traditions with them. Due to historical Lao migrations from Laos into neighboring regions, Lao cuisine has influenced the mainly Lao-populated region of Northeastern Thailand (Isan), and Lao foods were also introduced to Cambodia and Northern Thailand (Lanna) where the Lao have migrated.\n\nWith the Columbian Exchange, non-native crops such as tomato, papaya, corn, pineapple and chili peppers were introduced to Southeast Asia probably through the various sea ports of modern day Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam via the Philippines and Malacca. Through trades with the Portuguese and Europeans, acceptance and cultivation of non-native crops and ingredients quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nBy the mid-1500s, the Europeans were already exploring and trading with mainland Southeast Asia reaching as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Laos. Some of the more notable Europeans who had travelled as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang or wrote extensively about their experiences were Fernão Mendes Pinto (1542-1545), Diogo Veloso and Blas Ruiz (1596), Geebard van Wusthof (1641), Giovanni Filippo de Marini (1642-1648), Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix (1830) and Henri Mouhot (1861). \n\nSimon de la Loubère (1642-1729) observed that the cultivation of the papaya was already widespread in Siam around the early 1700s and by the time Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix (1830) arrived as missionary to Bangkok; the papaya and chilli peppers was already fully integrated in the Lao territory, dependencies and the Southeast Asian food culture as a whole. \n\nAccording to Henri Mouhot (1826 - 1861), French explorer and \"discoverer\" of Angkor Wat, during his trip to Luang Prabang, Laos noted that the Laotians absolutely adored chili peppers.\n\nIn his book, \"Culture and Customs of Laos\", Arne Kislenko noted the following about Lao cuisine:\n\nAny discussion about Lao cuisine cannot be limited to Laos. There are approximately six times more ethnic Lao in the Isan region of northeastern Thailand than in Laos itself, which makes it necessary to go beyond national boundaries in search of definitively Lao food. In fact, with the recent droves of migrants from Isan further south to Bangkok, the Thai capital has in many respects become the epicenter of Lao cuisine. Some estimate that more Lao are there than in any other city in the world, including Vientiane. There are also sizable expatriate communities in places like the United States and France that make for numerous culinary variations abroad.\n\nDespite there being more ethnic Lao living in Thailand than in Laos and Lao cuisine playing a pivotal role in making Thai food an international phenomenon, very little to no mention of the word \"Lao\" is found. This phenomenon is most likely the direct consequence of forced Thaification (1942–present), an official attempt to promote national unity and \"Thainess\", where any mention of \"Lao\" and other non-Thai descriptors were removed and replaced with \"northeastern Thai\" or \"Isan\".\n\nConsequently, Thaification has led to social discrimination against northeasterners and the word \"Lao\" became a derogatory term. Being \"Lao\" was stigmatized as being uneducated and backward, thus causing many northeasterners to be ashamed to be known as being Lao. More recently, as Lao identity loses its stigma, there is now a real sense of resurgence and pride in Lao identity, particularly among the Isan youth.\n\nIn the West, even with a sizable expatriate communities, Lao cuisine is still virtually unknown even though much of what is served in Thai restaurants is likely to be Lao or Lao-owned. In fact, unbeknownst to most people when they eat their favourite som tam, larb, and sticky rice at their favourite Thai or northeastern Thai (Isan) restaurants they are actually eating the Thai versions of traditional Lao food. This accidental reinforcement of Thaification by the expatriate Lao communities and Lao restaurateurs is well observed by Malaphone Phommasa and Celestine Detvongsa in their article, \"Lao American Ethnic Economy\":\nUnlike […] ethnic specific stores, Lao-owned restaurants are doing better in reaching out to the general public. Although there are some restaurants that advertised as singularly \"Laotian\", many Lao restaurants are established under the guise of Thai restaurants and Thai/Lao restaurants to entice mainstream customers. Because most Americans are unfamiliar with Laotian food, Lao entrepreneurs have aimed to acquire more business by advertising themselves as Thai restaurants: the latter have successfully achieved popularity with the mainstream population. These restaurateurs would then incorporate Lao dishes onto the menu. Although there are many similarities between Lao and northern Thai cuisine, certain foods will distinguish a true Thai restaurant from a Lao-owned restaurant would be the inclusion of \"sticky rice\" on the menu...\n\nThere is now a growing movement to promote Lao cuisine led by Chef Seng and executive chef Phet Schwader, to name a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nFruits in Laos may consist of watermelon, pineapple, sugar apple, (custard apple or sweetsop), longan, litchi, Asian pear, mango, rose apple (water apple), banana, jackfruit, rambutan, young coconut, orange, sweet tamarind, papaya, durian, sugarcane, pomelo, sapodilla, guava, star apple, mangosteen, melon, santol, langsat, grapes, corossolier (soursop), \"mak yom\", and \"mak num nom\".\n\nMelon carving is also a popular tradition in Laos, where artists may carve beautiful flowers and other designs into fruits such as watermelon. Fruit arrangements are also common, and these are done during special occasions such as weddings and other ceremonies.\n\nThe typical Lao stove, or brazier, is called a \"tao-lo\" and is fueled by charcoal. It is shaped like a bucket, with room for a single pot or pan to sit on top. The wok, \"maw khang\" in Lao, is used for frying and stir frying. Sticky rice is steamed inside of a bamboo basket, a \"huad\", which sits on top of a pot, which is called the \"maw nung\".\n\nA large, deep mortar called a \"khok\" is used for pounding \"tam mak hoong\" and other foods. It is indispensable in the Lao kitchen.\n\nGrilling, boiling, stewing, steaming, searing and mixing (as in salads) are all traditional cooking methods. Stir-frying is now common, but considered to be a Chinese influence. Stews are often green in color, because of the large proportion of vegetables used as well as \"ya nang\" leaf. Soups/stews are categorized as follows, \"tom,\" \"tom jeud,\" \"kaeng,\" and \"kaeng soua.\"\n\n\"Ping\" means grilled. It is a favorite cooking method. \"Ping gai\" is grilled chicken, \"ping sin\" is grilled meat, and \"ping pa\" is grilled fish. Before grilling, the meat is typically seasoned with minced garlic, minced coriander root, minced galangal, salt, soy sauce, and fish sauce, each in varying quantities, if at all, according to preference. The Lao seem to prefer a longer grilling at lower heat.\n\nThe result is grilled meat that is typically drier than what Westerners are accustomed to. The Lao probably prefer their food this way, because they wish to keep their hands dry and clean for handling sticky rice. They also typically eat the grilled food with a hot sauce (\"chaew\") of some sort, which takes away the dryness.\n\nLao food differs from neighboring cuisines in multiple respects. One is that the Lao meal almost always includes a large quantity of fresh raw greens, vegetables and herbs served undressed on the side. Another is that savory dishes are never sweet. \"Sweet and sour\" is generally considered bizarre and foreign in Laos. Yet another is that some dishes are bitter. There is a saying in Lao cuisine, \"\"van pen lom; khom pen ya,\"\" which can be translated as, \"sweet brings you down; bitter is medicine.\"\n\nA couple of the green herbs favored in Lao cuisine but generally ignored by their neighbors are mint and dill, both of paramount importance. Galangal is a cooking herb that is heavily favored in Laos, unlike in neighboring countries. It appears in probably the majority of Lao dishes, along with the conventional herbs: garlic, shallots, lemongrass, etc. Another distinctive characteristic of Lao food or more properly, Lao eating habits, is that food is frequently eaten at room temperature. This may be attributable to the fact that Lao food served with sticky rice is traditionally handled by hand.\n\nThe traditional manner of eating was communal, with diners sitting on a reed mat on the wooden floor around a raised platform woven out of rattan called a \"ka toke.\" Dishes are arranged on the \"ka toke,\" which is of a standard size. Where there are many diners, multiple \"ka tokes\" will be prepared. Each \"ka toke\" will have one or more baskets of sticky rice, which is shared by all the diners at the \"ka toke.\"\n\nIn recent times, eating at a \"ka toke\" is the exception rather than the rule. The custom is maintained, however, at temples, where each monk is served his meal on a \"ka toke.\" Once food is placed on the \"ka toke\" it becomes a \"pha kao\". In modern homes, the term for preparing the table for a meal is still \"taeng pha kao,\" or prepare the \"phah kao.\"\n\nTraditionally, spoons were used only for soups and white rice, and chopsticks (ໄມ້ທູ່,\"mai thu\") were used only for noodles. Most food was handled by hand. The reason this custom evolved is probably due to the fact that sticky rice can only be easily handled by hand.\n\nLao meals typically consist of a soup dish, a grilled dish, a sauce, greens, and a stew or mixed dish (\"koy\" or \"laap\"). The greens are usually fresh raw greens, herbs and other vegetables, though depending on the dish they accompany, they could also be steamed or more typically, parboiled. Dishes are not eaten in sequence; the soup is sipped throughout the meal. Beverages, including water, are not typically a part of the meal. When guests are present, the meal is always a feast, with food made in quantities sufficient for twice the number of diners. For a host, not having enough food for guests would be humiliating.\n\nThe custom is to close the rice basket, when one is finished eating.\n\nJaew (), a popular type of dipping sauce in Laos.\n\nKap kaem (), are dishes served as snacks, before the main dish, or with beer.\n\nSarad (), is a general name to describe a dish with mixed vegetables, herbs, and spices. Meat salads in Laos are known as \"larb\" or \"laap\".\n\nKaeng (; lit. \"soup\")\n\nAhan ping (; lit. \"grilled food\")\n\nAhan neung (; lit. \"steamed food\")\n\nAhan kap khao (; lit. \"food with rice\"), are dishes made with rice as the main ingredient. In most Lao meals, glutinous rice known as \"khao niao\", is a staple to the Laotian diet.\n\nFeu () or Mee (). Noodles are popular dishes in northern and central Laos. These can vary from \"wet noodles\", served with broth, or \"dry noodles\" which are typically stir-fried.\n\nKhong van (; lit. \"sweet things\"). Lao desserts are generally made with the combination of tropical fruits and glutinous rice products. These can vary from types of cakes, to jelly, to drinks, and custards.\n\nLao coffee is often called \"Pakxong\" coffee (\"cafe pakxong\" in Lao), which is grown on the Bolovens Plateau around the town of Pakxong. This area is sometimes said to be the best place in Southeast Asia for coffee cultivation. Both Robusta and Arabica are grown in Laos, and if you ask for Arabica, there is a very good chance the proprietor will know what you are talking about. Most of the Arabica in Laos is consumed locally and most of the Robusta is exported to Thailand, where it goes into Nescafé. The custom in Laos is to drink coffee in glasses, with condensed milk in the bottom, followed by a chaser of green tea. The highly regarded tea is also grown on the Bolovens Plateau.\n\nThere are two general types of traditional alcoholic beverages, both produced from rice: \"lao hai\" and \"lao lao\". \"Lao hai\" means \"jar alcohol\" and is served from an earthen jar. It is communally and competitively drunk through straws at festive occasions. It can be likened to sake in appearance and flavor. \"Lao lao\" or \"Lao alcohol\" is more like a whiskey. It is also called \"lao khao\" or, in English, \"white alcohol\". However, there is also a popular variant of lao lao made from purple rice, which has a pinkish hue.\n\nIn more recent times, the Lao state-owned brewery's Beerlao has become ubiquitous in Laos and is highly regarded by expatriates and residents alike. The \"Bangkok Post\" has described it as the Dom Perignon of Asian beers. In 2004, \"Time\" magazine described it as Asia's best beer. In June 2005, it beat 40 other brews to take the silver prize at Russia's Osiris Beer Festival, which it had entered for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "210015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210015", "title": "Glutinous rice", "text": "Glutinous rice\n\nGlutinous rice (\"Oryza sativa var. glutinosa\"; also called sticky rice, sweet rice or waxy rice) is a type of rice grown mainly in Southeast and East Asia and the eastern parts of South Asia, which has opaque grains, very low amylose content, and is especially sticky when cooked. It is widely consumed across Asia.\n\nIt is called glutinous (Latin: \"glūtinōsus\") in the sense of being glue-like or sticky, and not in the sense of containing gluten (which it does not). While often called \"sticky rice\", it differs from non-glutinous strains of japonica rice which also become sticky to some degree when cooked. There are numerous cultivars of glutinous rice, which include japonica, indica and tropical japonica strains.\n\nIn China, glutinous rice has been grown for at least 2,000 years.\n\nGlutinous rice is grown in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, Northeast India, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines. An estimated 85% of Lao rice production is of this type. The rice has been recorded in the region for at least 1,100 years.\n\nThe improved rice varieties (in terms of yield) adopted throughout Asia during the Green Revolution were non-glutinous, and Lao farmers rejected them in favor of their traditional sticky varieties. Over time, higher-yield strains of glutinous rice have become available from the Lao National Rice Research Programme. By 1999, more than 70% of the area along the Mekong River Valley were of these newer strains.\n\nGlutinous rice is distinguished from other types of rice by having no (or negligible amounts of) amylose, and high amounts of amylopectin (the two components of starch). Amylopectin is responsible for the sticky quality of glutinous rice. The difference has been traced to a single mutation that was selected for by farmers.\n\nLike all types of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten (i.e. does not contain glutenin and gliadin), and should be safe for gluten-free diets.\n\nGlutinous rice can be used either milled or unmilled (that is, with the bran removed or not removed). Milled glutinous rice is white and fully opaque (unlike non-glutinous rice varieties, which are somewhat translucent when raw), whereas the bran can give unmilled glutinous rice a purple or black color. Black and purple glutinous rice are distinct strains from white glutinous rice. In developing Asia, there is little regulation, and some governments have issued advisories about toxic dyes being added to colour adulterated rice. Both black and white glutinous rice can be cooked as discrete grains, or ground into flour and cooked as a paste or gel.\n\nSticky rice is used in many recipes throughout Southeast and East Asia.\n\nSticky rice called \"bora saul\" is the core component of Assamese sweets, snacks, and breakfast. This rice is widely used in the traditional sweets of Assam, which are very different from the traditional sweets of India whose basic component is milk.\n\nSuch traditional sweets in Assam are Pitha (Narikolor pitha, Til pitha, Ghila pitha, Tel pitha, Kettle pitha, etc.). Also, its powder form is used as breakfast or other light meal directly with milk. They are called Pitha guri (If powder was done without frying the rice, by just crushing it after soaking) or Handoh guri (If rice is dry fried first, and then crushed).\n\nThe soaked rice is also cooked with no added water inside a special kind of bamboo (called \"sunga saul bnaah\"). This meal is called \"sunga saul\".\n\nDuring religious ceremonies, Assamese people make \"Mithoi\" (\"Kesa mithoi\" and \"Poka mithoi\") using \"Gnud\" with it. Sometimes \"Bhog\", \"Payakh\" and \"Khir\" are also made from it using milk and sugar with it.\n\nDifferent Assamese communities make rice beer from it which is preferred more than other rice, as it is sweeter and more alcoholic. They also offer this beer to their gods and ancestors (demi-gods). Rice cooked with it is also taken directly as lunch or dinner on rare occasions.\n\nIn Bangladesh, especially in the Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar and Sylhet areas, the sticky rice called \"bini dhan\"(unhusked sticky rice) is very popular. Both white and pink varieties are cultivated at many homestead farms. Husked sticky rice is called \"bini choil\" (chal) in some dialects. Boiled or steamed \"bini choil\" is called \"Bini Bhat\". With meat or fish curry and grated coconut, \"Bini Bhat\" is a popular breakfast. Sometimes it is eaten with a splash of sugar, salt, and coconut only without any curry. \"Bin dhan\" also used to make \"khoi\" (pop rice like popcorn) and \"chida\" (bitten husked rice). A part of these many other sweet items made of \"bini choil\" are popular. \nOne of the favorite pitas made of \"bini choil\" is \"atikka pita\" (pita).It is made with the mixture of cubed or small sliced coconut, sugar or brown sugar, ripe banana and \"bini choil\" wrapped with banana leaf and steamed.\nAnother delicacy is \"Patishapta\" pita made of ground \"bini choil\". Ground \"bini choil\" is sprayed over a hot pan and a mixture of grated coconut, sugar, milk powder; then ghee is sprayed over that and rolled out. Dumplings made of powdered fried \"bini choil\" called laru. First \"bini choil\" is fried and ground into flour. This flour is mixed with sugar or brown sugar, and ghee or butter and is made into small balls or dumplings.\nOne kind of porridge or \"khir\" made of \"bini choil\" is called \"modhu (honey) bhat\". This \"modhu bhat\" becomes naturally sweet without mixing any sugar. It is one of the delicacies of local people. To make \"modhu bhat\" first prepare some normal paddy or rice \"(dhan)\" for germination by soaking it in the water for few days. After coming out of little sprout dry the paddy and husk and grind the husked rice called \"jala choil\" into flour. It tastes sweet. Mixing this sweet flour with freshly boiled or steamed warm \"bini bhat\" and then fermenting the mixture overnight yields \"modhu bhat\". It is eaten either on its own or with milk, jaggery or grated coconut.\n\nGlutinous rice, called \"kao hnyin\" (), is very popular in Myanmar (also known as Burma).\n\n\nIn the Chinese language, glutinous rice is known as \"nuòmǐ\" (糯米) or \"chu̍t-bí\" (秫米) in Hokkien.\n\nGlutinous rice is also often ground to make glutinous rice flour. This flour is made into \"niangao\" and sweet-filled dumplings \"tangyuan\", both of which are commonly eaten at Chinese New Year. It also used as a thickener and for baking.\n\nGlutinous rice or glutinous rice flour are both used in many Chinese bakery products and in many varieties of dim sum. They produce a flexible, resilient dough, which can take on the flavors of whatever other ingredients are added to it. Cooking usually consists of steaming or boiling, sometimes followed by pan-frying or deep-frying.\n\nSweet glutinous rice is eaten with red bean paste.\n\n\"Nuòmǐ fàn\" (糯米飯), is steamed glutinous rice usually cooked with Chinese sausage, chopped Chinese mushrooms, chopped barbecued pork, and optionally dried shrimp or scallop (the recipe varies depending on the cook's preference).\n\n\"Zongzi\" (Traditional Chinese 糭子/糉子, Simplified Chinese 粽子) is a dumpling consisting of glutinous rice and sweet or savory fillings wrapped in large flat leaves (usually bamboo), which is then boiled or steamed. It is especially eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival, but may be eaten at any time of the year. It is popular as an easily transported snack, or a meal to consume while traveling. It is a common food among Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nCifangao (Traditional Chinese 糍飯糕, Simplified Chinese 糍饭糕) is a popular breakfast food originating in Eastern China consisting of cooked glutinous rice compressed into squares or rectangles, and then deep-fried. Additional seasoning and ingredients such as beans, zha cai, and sesame seeds may be added to the rice for added flavour. It has a similar appearance and external texture to hash browns.\n\n\"Cifantuan\" (Traditional Chinese 糍飯糰, Simplified Chinese 糍饭团) is another breakfast food consisting of a piece of youtiao tightly wrapped in cooked glutinous rice, with or without additional seasoning ingredients. Japanese onigiri resembles this Chinese food.\n\n\"Lo mai gai\" (糯米雞) is a dim sum dish consisting of glutinous rice with chicken in a lotus-leaf wrap, which is then steamed. It is served as a dim sum dish in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\n\"Ba bao fan\" (八寶飯), or \"eight treasure rice\", is a dessert made from glutinous rice, steamed and mixed with lard, sugar, and eight kinds of fruits or nuts.\n\nA distinctive feature of Hakka cuisine is its variety of steamed snack-type buns, dumplings and patties made with a dough of coarsely ground rice, or \"ban\". Collectively known as \"rice snacks\", some kinds are filled with various salty or sweet ingredients.\n\nCommon examples of rice snacks made with \"ban\" from glutinous or sticky rice and non-glutinous rice include \"Aiban\" (mugwort patty), \"Caibao\" (turnip bun)[This 'turnip' is not the Western turnip. The proper name is yam bean. [In Mandarin Chinese, it is known as dòushǔ(豆薯) or liáng shǔ (涼薯)] \"Ziba\" (sticky rice balls) and \"Bantiao\" (\"Mianpaban\" or flat rice noodles).\n\n\"Aiban\" encompasses several varieties of steamed patties and dumplings of various shapes and sizes, consisting of an outer layer made of glutinous \"ban\" dough filled with salty or sweet ingredients. It gets its name from the aromatic \"ai\" grass (mugwort), which after being dried, powdered and mixed with the \"ban\", gives the dough a green color and an intriguing tea-like taste. Typical salty fillings include ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded white turnips. The most common sweet filling is made with red beans.\n\n\"Caibao\" is a generic term for all types of steamed buns with various sorts of filling. Hakka-style \"caibao\" are distinctive in that the enclosing skin is made with glutinous rice dough in the place of wheat flour dough. Besides ground pork, mushrooms and shredded turnips, fillings may include ingredients such as dried shrimp and dry fried-shallot flakes.\n\n\"Ziba\" is glutinous rice dough which, after steaming in a big container, is mashed into a sticky, putty-like mass from which small patties are formed and coated with a layer of sugary peanut powder. It has no filling.\n\nIn the Philippines, glutinous rice is known as malagkit in Tagalog or pilit in Visayan, among other names. Both meaning \"sticky\". The most common way glutinous rice is prepared in the Philippines is through soaking uncooked glutinous rice in water or coconut milk (usually overnight) and then grinding it into a thick paste (traditionally with stone mills). This produces a rich and smooth viscous rice dough known as galapóng, which is the basis for numerous rice cakes in the Philippines. However, in modern preparation methods, \"galapong\" is sometimes made directly from dry glutinous rice flour (or from commercial Japanese \"mochiko\"), with poorer-quality results.\n\n\"Galapong\" was traditionally allowed to ferment, which is still required for certain dishes. A small amount of starter culture of microorganisms (\"tapay\" or \"bubod\") or palm wine (\"tubâ\") may be traditionally added to rice being soaked to hasten the fermentation. These can be substituted with yeast or baking soda in modern versions. Other versions of \"galapong\" may also be treated with wood ash lye.\n\nAside from the numerous white and red glutinous rice cultivars, the most widely used glutinous rice heirloom cultivars in the Philippines are \"tapol\" and \"pirurutong\" rice, both of which have colors ranging from purple, reddish brown, to almost black. However both varieties are expensive and becoming increasingly rare, thus some Filipino recipes nowadays substitute it with dyed regular glutinous rice or infuse purple yam (\"ube\") to achieve the same coloration.\n\nDessert delicacies in the Philippines are known by the umbrella term \"kakanin\" (from \"kanin\", \"prepared rice\"). These were originally made primarily from rice, but in recent centuries, the term has come to encompass dishes made from other types of flour, including corn flour (\"masa\"), cassava, wheat, and so on. Glutinous rice figures prominently in two main subtypes of \"kakanin\": the \"puto\" (steamed rice cakes), and the \"bibingka\" (baked rice cakes). Both largely utilize glutinous rice \"galapong\". A notable variant of \"puto\" is \"puto bumbong\", which is made with \"pirurutong\".\n\nOther \"kakanin\" that use glutinous rice include \"suman\", \"biko\", and \"sapin-sapin\" among others. There is also a special class of boiled \"galapong\" dishes like \"palitaw\", \"moche\", \"mache\", and \"masi\". Fried \"galapong\" is also used to make various types of \"buchi\", which are the local Chinese-Filipino versions of \"jian dui\". They are also used to make \"puso\", which are boiled rice cakes in woven leaf pouches.\n\nAside from \"kakanin\", glutinous rice is also used in traditional Filipino rice gruels or porridges known as \"lugaw\". They include both savory versions like \"arroz caldo\" or \"goto\" which are similar to Chinese-style congee; and dessert versions like \"champorado\", \"binignit\", and \"ginataang mais\".\n\nGlutinous rice is known as beras ketan or simply ketan in Java and most of Indonesia, and pulut in Sumatra. It is widely used as an ingredient for a wide variety of sweet, savoury or fermented snacks. Glutinous rice is used as either hulled grains or milled into flour. It is usually mixed with santan, meaning coconut milk in Indonesian, along with a bit of salt to add some taste. Glutinous rice is rarely eaten as a staple. One example is \"lemang\", which is glutinous rice and coconut milk cooked in bamboo stem lined by banana leaves. Glutinous rice is also sometimes used in a mix with normal rice in rice dishes such as \"nasi tumpeng\" or nasi tim. It is widely used during the Lebaran seasons as traditional food. It is also used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as \"tuak\" and \"brem bali\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, glutinous rice dishes adapted from other cultures are easily available. Examples include \"kue moci\" (mochi, Japanese) and \"bacang\" (zongzi, Chinese).\n\nIndonesian glutinous rice dishes\n\nIn Japan, glutinous rice is known as \"mochigome\" [mō-chee-gōmay] (). It is used in traditional dishes such as sekihan is known as the red rice, okowa, and ohagi. It may also be ground into \"mochiko\" (もち粉) a rice flour, used to make \"mochi\" (もち) which are known as sweet rice cakes to the non-Japanese, \"mochi\" a traditional rice cake prepared for the Japanese New Year but also eaten year-round. See also Japanese rice.\n\nIn Korea, glutinous rice is called \"chapssal\" (Hangul: 찹쌀), and its characteristic stickiness is called \"chalgi\" (Hangul: 찰기). Cooked rice made of glutinous rice is called \"chalbap\" (Hangul: 찰밥) and rice cakes (Hangul: 떡, ddeok) are called \"chalddeok\" or \"chapssalddeok\" (Hangul: 찰떡, 찹쌀떡). \"Chalbap\" is used as stuffing in \"samgyetang\" (Hangul: 삼계탕).\n\nGlutinous rice is the main rice eaten in Laos (see Lao cuisine), where it is known as \"khao niao\" (Lao: ເຂົ້າໜຽວ): \"khao\" means rice, and \"niao\" means sticky. It is cooked by soaking for several hours and then steaming in a bamboo basket or \"houat\" (Lao: ຫວດ). After that, it should be turned out on a clean surface and kneaded with a wooden paddle to release the steam; this results in rice balls that will stick to themselves but not to fingers. The large rice ball is kept in a small basket made of bamboo or \"tip khao\" (Lao: ຕິບເຂົ້າ). The rice is sticky but dry, rather than wet and gummy like non-glutinous varieties. The fingers of the right hand are used to eat it by wadding the rice.\n\nLaotians consume glutinous rice as part of their main diet; they also use toasted glutinous rice \"khao khoua\" (Lao:ເຂົ້າຄົ່ວ) to add a nut-like flavor to many dishes. A popular Lao meal is a combination of Lao grilled chicken \"ping kai\" (Lao:ປີ້ງໄກ່), Lao papaya salad \"tam mak houng\" (Lao:ຕຳໝາກຫູ່ງ), and Lao sticky rice (\"khao niao\").\nKhao Niao has also been used for preparing a popular dish from Laos called Naem Khao (or Laotian crispy rice salad). It is made with deep-fried sticky rice balls, chunks of Lao-style fermented pork sausage called som moo, chopped peanuts, grated coconut, sliced scallions or shallots, mint, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, and other ingredients.\nKhao niao is also used as an ingredient in desserts. Khao niao mixed with coconut milk can be served with ripened mango or durian. \"Khao tôm\" (Lao:ເຂົ້າຕົ້ມ) is a steamed mixture of \"khao niao\" with sliced fruits and coconut milk.\n\nIn Malaysia, glutinous rice is known as pulut. It is usually mixed with santan, coconut milk in English, along with a bit of salt to add some taste. It is widely used during the Raya festive seasons as traditional food, such as:\n\nIn Thailand, glutinous rice is known as \"khao niao\" (; lit. \"sticky rice\") in central Thailand and Isan, and as \"khao nueng\" (; lit. \"steamed rice\") in northern Thailand. Northern Thais (Lanna people) and northeastern Thais traditionally eat glutinous rice as their staple food. Southern and central Thais, and northeastern Thais from Surin Province and neighboring areas influenced by the Khmer-Thai people favor non-sticky \"khao chao\".\n\n\nGlutinous rice is called \"gạo nếp\" in Vietnamese. Dishes made from glutinous rice in Vietnam are typically served as desserts or side dishes, but some can be served as main dishes. There is a wide array of glutinous rice dishes in Vietnamese cuisine, the majority of them can be categorized as follows:\n\nGlutinous rice can also be fermented to make Vietnamese alcoholic beverages, such as rượu nếp, rượu cần and rượu đế.\n\n\nAccording to legend, glutinous rice was used to make the mortar in the construction of the Great Wall of China. Chemical tests have confirmed that this is true for the city walls of Xi'an. In Assam also, this rice was used for building palaces during Ahom rule.\n\nGlutinous rice starch is often used as a vegetarian glue or adhesive.\n"}
{"id": "210458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210458", "title": "Waffle", "text": "Waffle\n\nA waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties. Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially precooked and frozen.\n\nThe word \"waffle\" first appears in the English language in 1725: \"Waffles. Take flower, cream...\" It is directly derived from the Dutch \"wafel\", which itself derives from the Middle Dutch \"wafele\".\n\nWhile the Middle Dutch \"wafele\" is first attested to at the end of the 13th century, it is preceded by the French \"walfre\" in 1185; both from Frankish *\"wafla\" 'honeycomb' or 'cake'.\n\nAlternate spellings throughout modern and medieval Europe include waffe, wafre, wafer, wâfel, waufre, iauffe, gaufre, goffre, gauffre, wafe, waffel, wåfe, wāfel, wafe, vaffel, and våffla.\n\nIn ancient times the Greeks cooked flat cakes, called obelios, between hot metal plates. As they were spread throughout medieval Europe, the cake mix, a mixture of flour, water or milk, and often eggs, became known as wafers and were also cooked over an open fire between iron plates with long handles.\n\nWaffles are preceded, in the early Middle Ages, around the period of the 9th–10th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of \"fer à hosties\" / \"hostieijzers\" (communion wafer irons) and \"moule à oublies\" (wafer irons). While the communion wafer irons typically depicted imagery of Jesus and his crucifixion, the \"moule à oublies\" featured more trivial Biblical scenes or simple, emblematic designs. The format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communion.\n\nThe oublie was, in its basic form, composed only of grain flour and water – just as was the communion wafer. It took until the 11th century, as a product of The Crusades bringing new culinary ingredients to Western Europe, for flavorings such as orange blossom water to be added to the oublies; however, locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that time.\n\nOublies, not formally named as such until \"ca. 1200\", spread throughout northwestern continental Europe, eventually leading to the formation of the \"oublieurs\" guild in 1270. These oublieurs/obloyers were responsible for not only producing the oublies but also for a number of other contemporaneous and subsequent \"pâtisseries légères\" (light pastries), including the waffles that were soon to arise.\n\nIn the late 14th century, the first known waffle recipe was penned in an anonymous manuscript, \"Le Ménagier de Paris\", written by a husband as a set of instructions to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are a variation of the first: \"Beat some eggs in a bowl, season with salt and add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease\". The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed in between two layers of batter, grated and mixed in to the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / \"gaufre\" in name only, as the recipe contained no leavening.\nThough some have speculated that waffle irons first appeared in the 13th–14th centuries, it was not until the 15th century that a true physical distinction between the oublie and the waffle began to evolve. Notably, while a recipe like the fourth in \"Le Ménagier de Paris\" was only flour, salt and wine – indistinguishable from common oublie recipes of the time – what did emerge was a new shape to many of the irons being produced. Not only were the newly fashioned ones rectangular, taking the form of the \"fer à hosties\", but some circular oublie irons were cut down to create rectangles. It was also in this period that the waffle's classic grid motif appeared clearly in a French \"fer à oublie\" and a Belgian \"wafelijzer\" – albeit in a more shallowly engraved fashion – setting the stage for the more deeply gridded irons that were about to become commonplace throughout Belgium.\nBy the 16th century, paintings by Joachim de Beuckelaer, Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern waffle form. Bruegel's work, in particular, not only shows waffles being cooked, but fine detail of individual waffles. In those instances, the waffle pattern can be counted as a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting the use of a fairly thin batter, akin to our contemporary Brussels waffles (Brusselse wafels).\n\nEarliest of the 16th century waffle recipes, \"Om ghode waffellen te backen\" – from the Dutch \"KANTL 15\" manuscript (\"ca. 1500–1560\") – is only the second known waffle recipe after the four variants described in \"Le Ménagier de Paris\". For the first time, partial measurements were given, sugar was used, and spices were added directly to the batter: \"Take grated white bread. Take with that the yolk of an egg and a spoonful of pot sugar or powdered sugar. Take with that half water and half wine, and ginger and cinnamon.\"\n\nAlternately attributed to the 16th and 17th centuries, \"Groote Wafelen\" from the Belgian \"Een Antwerps kookboek\" was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): \"Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those who do not want them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it.\" Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin \"moule à oublies\". \"Groote Wafelen\", in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.\nBy the mid-16th century, there were signs of waffles' mounting French popularity. Francois I, king from 1494–1547, of whom it was said \"les aimait beacoup\" (loved them a lot), had a set of waffle irons cast in pure silver. His successor, Charles IX enacted the first waffle legislation in 1560, in response to a series of quarrels and fights that had been breaking out between the oublieurs. They were required \"\"d'être au moins à la distance de deux toises l'un de l'autre. \"\" (to be no less than 4 yards from one to the other).\n\nMoving into the 17th century, unsweetened or honey-sweetened waffles and oublies – often made of non-wheat grains – were the type generally accessible to the average citizen. The wheat-based and particularly the sugar-sweetened varieties, while present throughout Europe, were prohibitively expensive for all but the monarchy and bourgeoisie. Even for the Dutch, who controlled much of the mid-century sugar trade, a kilogram of sugar was worth ½ an ounce of silver (the equivalent of ~$7 for a 5 lb. bag, 01/2016 spot silver prices), while, elsewhere in Europe, it fetched twice the price of opium. The wealthier families' waffles, known often as \"mestiers\", were, \"\"...smaller, thinner and above all more delicate, being composed of egg yolks, sugar, and the finest of the finest flour, mixed in white wine. One serves them at the table like dessert pastry.\"\"\n\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, expansion of Caribbean plantations had cut sugar prices in half. Waffle recipes abounded and were becoming decadent in their use of sugar and other rare ingredients. For instance, Menon's \"gaufre\" from \"Nouveau Traité de la Cuisine\" included a livre of sugar for a demi-livre of flour.\n\nGermany became a leader in the development and publication of waffle recipes during the 18th century, introducing coffee waffles, the specific use of Hefeweizen beer yeast, cardamom, nutmeg, and a number of zuickerwaffeln (sugar waffles). At the same time, the French introduced whipped egg whites to waffles, along with lemon zests, Spanish wine, and cloves. Joseph Gillier even published the first chocolate waffle recipe, featuring three ounces of chocolate grated and mixed into the batter, before cooking.\n\nA number of the 18th century waffle recipes took on names to designate their country or region/city of origin – \"Schwedische Waffeln\", \"Gauffres à l'Allemande\" and, most famous of all the 18th century varieties, \"Gauffres à la Flamande\", which were first recorded in 1740. These \"Gauffres à la Flamande\" (Flemish waffles / Gaufres de Lille) were the first French recipe to use beer yeast, but unlike the Dutch and German yeasted recipes that preceded them, use only egg whites and over a pound of butter in each batch. They are also the oldest named recipe that survives in popular use to the present day, produced regionally and commercially by Meert.\n\nThe 18th century is also when the word \"waffle\" first appeared in the English language, in a 1725 printing of \"Court Cookery\" by Robert Smith. Recipes had begun to spread throughout England and America, though essentially all were patterned after established Dutch, Belgian, German, and French versions. Waffle parties, known as 'wafel frolics', were documented as early as 1744 in New Jersey, and the Dutch had earlier established waffles in New Amsterdam (New York City).\nLiège waffles, the most popular contemporary Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in \"l'Art du Cuisiner\" where brioche dough is introduced as the base of the waffle and \"sucre cassé\" (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate \"gros sucre\" into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, \"Le Maitre d'Hotel Français\". Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for \"gaufres grêlées\" (hail waffles), where \"gros sucre\" is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.\n\nWaffles remained widely popular in Europe for the first half of the 19th century, despite the 1806 British Atlantic naval blockade that greatly inflated the price of sugar. This coincided with the commercial production of beet sugar in continental Europe, which, in a matter of decades, had brought the price down to historical lows. Within the transitional period from cane to beet sugar, Florian Dacher formalized a recipe for the Brussels Waffle, the predecessor to American \"Belgian\" waffles, recording the recipe in 1842/43. \"Stroopwafels\" (Dutch syrup wafels), too, rose to prominence in the Netherlands by the middle of the century. However, by the second half of the 1800s, inexpensive beet sugar became widely available, and a wide range of pastries, candies and chocolates were now accessible to the middle class, as never before; waffles' popularity declined rapidly.\n\nBy the early 20th century, waffle recipes became rare in recipe books, and only 29 professional waffle craftsmen, the oublieurs, remained in Paris. Waffles were shifting from a predominately street-vendor-based product to an increasingly homemade product, aided by the 1918 introduction of GE's first electric commercial waffle maker. By the mid-1930s, dry pancake/waffle mix had been marketed by a number of companies, including Aunt Jemima, Bisquick, and a team of three brothers from San Jose, Calif. – the Dorsas. It is the Dorsas who would go on to innovate commercial production of frozen waffles, which they began selling under the name \"Eggo\" in 1953. Manufacturers are now testing the production of waffles with potato starch, which increase the stability of the waffle and protect them from sticking to the iron.\n\nBelgian-style waffles were showcased at Expo 58 in Brussels. Another Belgian introduced Belgian-style waffles to the United States at the 1962 Seattle World's Fair, but only really took hold at the 1964 New York World's Fair, when another Belgian entrepreneur introduced his \"Bel-Gem\" waffles. In practice, contemporary American \"Belgian waffles\" are actually a hybrid of pre-existing American waffle types and ingredients and some attributes of the Belgian model.\n\nEven as most of the original recipes have faded from use, a number of the 18th and 19th century varieties can still be easily found throughout Northern Europe, where they were first developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaffles can be eaten plain (especially the thinner kinds) or eaten with various toppings, such as:\n\nIce cream cones are also a type of waffles or wafers.\n\nWaffles are also eaten with savory rather than sweet toppings.\n\nMixing is a critical step in batter preparation since overmixing causes the gluten to develop excessively and create a batter with too high of a viscosity that is difficult to pour and does not expand easily. A thick batter that is difficult spreading in the baking iron has an increased water activity of around 0.85. The increased viscosity made it harder for water to evaporate from the waffle causing an increase in water activity. The control waffles with a softer texture had a water activity of 0.74 after cooking. The Aw is less because the softer texture allows the water to evaporate. With an increased storage time, waffle physical and textural properties changes regardless of the batter viscosity. Aged waffles shrink because air bubbles leak out and the structure starts to condense. Hardness and viscosity also increases as time goes by. Aged waffle samples displayed a starch retrogradation peak that increased with storage time due to the fact that more crystalline structures were present. Starch retrogradation is mentioned previously in this paper. The enthalpy value for melting of starch crystals increased with storage time as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "210472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210472", "title": "Pancake", "text": "Pancake\n\nA pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.\n\nThe pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In Britain, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A \"crêpe\" is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a \"palačinke\", a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cheese cream, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.\n\nWhen potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a \"potato pancake\". Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes Blini, Kaletez, Ploye, and Memil-buchimgae.\n\nPancakes may be served at any time of the day with a variety of toppings or fillings but in America they are typically considered a breakfast food. Pancakes serve a similar function to waffles. In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as \"Pancake Day\", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (\"tēganitēs\"), ταγηνίτης (\"tagēnitēs\") or ταγηνίας (\"tagēnias\"), all words deriving from τάγηνον (\"tagēnon\"), \"frying pan\". The earliest attested references to \"tagenias\" are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast. Another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (\"staititēs\"), from σταίτινος (\"staitinos\"), \"of flour or dough of spelt\", derived from σταῖς (\"stais\"), \"flour of spelt\". Athenaeus mentions, in his Deipnosophistae, \"staititas\" topped with honey, sesame, and cheese. The Middle English word \"pancake\" appears in English in the 15th century.\n\nThe Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions \"alia dulcia\", Latin for \"other sweets\". These were much different from what are known as pancakes today.\n\nPancakes in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia) are known as \"injera\" (sometimes transliterated as \"enjera\", \"budenaa\" (Oromo), or \"canjeero\" (Somali)). \"Injera\" is a yeast-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally, it is made out of teff flour and is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea. \"Canjeero\", also known as \"lahooh\" or \"lahoh\", is a similar kind of flatbread eaten in Somalia and Yemen.\n\nIn Eritrea and Ethiopia, \"injera\" are usually served with one or more stews known as \"wat\" or with salads (especially, for instance, during periods of Ethiopian Orthodox fasting) or with other injera (\"injera firfir\"). The right hand is used to tear small pieces from the \"injera\" to use to pick up and eat the stews or salads. The \"injera\" under these stews soaks up juices and flavours and, after the stews and salads are finished, is also consumed. \"Injera\" thus acts simultaneously as food, eating utensil and plate. When the \"tablecloth\" formed by the \"injera\" is finished, the meal is over.\n\n\"Lahoh\" is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen. It is often eaten along with honey, ghee and tea. During lunch, \"lahoh\" is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.\n\nIn Kenya, pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.\n\nA \"pancake\" in South Africa is a crêpe. In Afrikaans, it is known as a \"pannekoek\" (plural \"pannekoeke\") and, traditionally, is prepared on gas stoves and eaten on wet and cold days. \"Pannekoeke\" are usually served with cinnamon-flavoured sugar (and, sometimes, lemon juice) that is either allowed to dissolve into and soften them or, if their crispy texture is to be retained, eaten immediately. They are a staple at Dutch Reformed Church fêtes.\n\n\"Plaatkoekies\" (\"flapjacks\", or lit. \"plate cookies\") are American-style \"silver dollar\" pancakes.\n\nA variation of the \"pannekoek\" is the South African crumpet, made from self-raising flour, eggs, milk and a pinch of salt. The smooth batter is fried in butter to produce a slightly raised flat cake. Crumpets are always served hot, usually for breakfast, with butter and golden syrup.\n\nIn Uganda, pancakes are locally made with bananas (one of the staple foods of the country) and usually served as a breakfast or as a snack option.\n\nBanana pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented backpackers' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term \"Banana Pancake Trail\".\n\nChinese pancakes may be either savoury or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter. The dough mostly consists of water, flour, and vegetable oil. The dish can be served as a side, usually alongside duck, or as a snack, topped with scallions along with hot and sour sauce.\n\nIndia has many styles of pancake. Variations range from their taste to the main ingredient used. All are made without the use of added raising agents.\n\nPancakes prepared using a north Indian cooking style are known as \"cheela\". Sweet \"cheela\" are made using sugar or jaggery with a wheat flour-based batter. North Indian salty pancakes are made using batter prepared from gram flour or green gram paste (\"moong daal\") and are sometimes garnished with \"paneer\", a cottage-style cheese. \n\n\"Dosa\", \"appam\", \"neer dosa\" and \"uttapam\" are pancakes made in a south Indian cooking style. They are prepared by fermenting rice batter and split-skinned urad bean (black lentil) blended with water. \"Meetha pooda\" – sweet pancakes often eaten with pickles and chutney – are a common breakfast food item in the Punjab. Most of the \"pitha\" in Assam are types of pancakes served on occasions such as Bihu festivals. The Bengali semi-sweet pancake \"pati-shapta\" is stuffed with grated coconut or thickened milk.\n\nIn Western India, the multi-grain \"thalipeeth\" is popular. In Goa, a traditional crêpe-like pancake known as \"alebele\" or \"alle belle\" is eaten at tea-time. It is usually filled with jaggery and coconut.\n\nIn Eastern India, \"malpuas\" are sometimes prepared in the form of pancakes.\n\nPancake in Indonesia called as \"panekuk\". The Indonesian pancake \"serabi\" is made from rice flour and coconut milk. The dish is often served with kinca, a thick, brown-colored coconut sugar syrup. Other toppings may include sugar, ground peanuts, sliced bananas, jackfruit, and other fruits, and chocolate. Other variations include cheddar cheese, corned beef, shredded chicken, and sausage. Other types of pancakes in Indonesia are \"dadar gulung\", \"kue ape\", \"kue apem\", \"kue cubit\", \"kue cucur\", \"kue terang bulan\", \"murtabak\", \"poffertjes\", \"roti canai\", and \"roti jala\".\n\nIn Japan, \"okonomiyaki\" are made from flour, egg, cabbage and a choice of ingredients. \"Oyaki\" are pancakes often stuffed with anko, eggplant, or nozawana. \"Dorayaki\" are a sort of sandwich made from Western-style pancakes and anko. Sweet crepes are also very popular.\n\nThe Japanese have also created a pancake inspired by American pancakes which is taller and fluffier, found in Singapore, Toronto, Australia and the UK.\n\nIn Korea, pancakes include \"jeon\", \"pajeon\", \"bindaetteok\", \"kimchijeon\", and \"hotteok\". These may be served during all times of the day as side dishes or just snacks. Variants of the dish use the batter of the pancake to make deep fried vegetables, meat, or fish.\n\nThe traditional Malay pancake in Malaysia and Singapore is called \"lempeng\". Cooked very similarly to an American or Canadian style pancake albeit without a rising agent, it is usually served during the breakfast hours with curry, \"rendang\", or \"sambal\".\n\nIn Nepal, the Newar have a savoury rice pancake called \"chataamari\" cooked with meat or eggs on top. This dish is also known as the \"Newari Pizza\", as it is served and eaten similarly to American pizza. Besides being served with meat or eggs, it can also be served plain.\n\nIn Pakistani cuisine, \"rishiki\" is a pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe, which is made from whole wheat flour, water and eggs and usually served with honey. It is widely consumed in the far north and is a staple of Chitrali cuisine.\n\nIn the Philippines, traditional dessert pancakes include \"salukara\", a rice pancake made from glutinous rice, eggs, and coconut milk. The batter is placed in a clay pot lined with banana leaves or greased with oil, and is baked over hot coals. \"Salukara\" is a subtype of \"bibingka\" (Philippine baked rice cakes). \"Panyalam\", a similar rice pancake from Mindanao, is deep-fried rather than baked.\n\nTraditional savory pancakes in the Philippines (including omelettes) are generally known under the term \"torta\". They include \"tortang talong\" (eggplant omelette), \"pudpod\" (smoked fish flake pancakes), and \"okoy\" (a pancake made of battered shrimp, pumpkin, or sweet potatoes).\n\nThe North American variety of pancakes, or \"hotcakes\", is also recognized, and despite it being commonly prepared for breakfast, it can also be eaten as an afternoon snack, with street kiosks selling small hotcakes topped with margarine and sugar.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine there are a variety of traditional pancakes; these include \"bánh xèo\" in the north, \"bánh khọt\" in the south, and \"bánh căn\" and \"bánh khoái\" in central Vietnam.\n\nIn Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, pancakes are called \"palatschinke\", \"palačinka\" and \"palacinka\", respectively (plural: \"palatschinken\", \"palačinky\", and \"palacinky\"). \"Kaiserschmarrn\" is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. In Romania, they are called \"clătită\" (plural: \"clătite\"). In countries of former Yugoslavia, they are called \"palačinka\" (plural: \"palačinke\"). In these languages, the word derives from the Latin \"placenta\", meaning \"cake\". These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, lingonberry, apple or strawberry jam, chocolate sauce, or hazelnut spread. Eurokrem, Nutella, and Lino-Lada fillings are favourite among the younger population. A traditional version includes filling pancakes with cheese, pouring yoghurt over them, and then baking in an oven.\n\nEastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a large variety of pancake types. In Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizer, main course, or dessert.\n\n\"Blini\" () and \"mlynci\" () are thin pancakes, somewhat thicker than crêpes, made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. Blini/mlynci cooking dates back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today's \"pancake week\" celebrated in the winter before the Great Lent. In pre-Christian times, blini and mlynci were symbolically considered by early Slavic peoples as a symbol of the sun, due to their round form.\nBlintzes ( \"blinchiki\") are thin crêpes made without yeast. Filled blintzes are also referred to as \"nalysnyky\" (), \"nalistniki\" () or \"nalesniki\" (). A filling such as jam, fruits, quark, or cottage cheese, potato, cooked ground meat or chicken, and even chopped mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage, and onions, is rolled or enveloped into a pre-fried blintz and then the blintz is lightly re-fried, sautéed, or baked.\n\nSmall thick pancakes are called \"oladyi\" () or \"oladky\" (). The batter may contain various additions, such as apple and raisins.\n\n\"Æbleskiver\" are traditional Danish pancakes made in a distinctive spherical shape. (The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not an ingredient.) \"Æbleskiver\" are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special cast iron pan with several hemispherical indentations. Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the \"æbleskiver\" begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. \"Æbleskiver\" are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\n\nFinnish pancakes greatly resemble \"plättar\" (see the description in the Sweden section below) and are called \"lettu\", \"lätty\", \"räiskäle\" or \"ohukainen\". In Finland pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice cream. In Finnish, \"lettu\" and \"pannukakku\" (literally \"pancake\") have different meanings, the latter having a structurally closer resemblance to a hotcake, and is baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan. \"Ålandspannkaka\", literally \"pancake of Åland\", is an extra thick variety of oven-made pancake that includes the addition of cardamom and either rice pudding or semolina porridge to the dough.\n\n\"Crêpes\", popular in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal, are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin pancakes and are served with a sweet (fruit, ice cream, jam, chocolate spread) or savoury filling (cheese, ham, seafood, spinach). In Francophone Europe, crêpes are often sold in special stands. In Italy they are called \"crespelle\" or \"scrippelle\". In Brittany, a \"galette\" (or \"galette bretonne\") is a large thin pancake made of buckwheat flour, often cooked on one side only.\n\nCrêpes are popular in many South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. They are consumed with sweet fillings (marmalade, dulce de leche) or with salty fillings (ground meat (Brazil), vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese).\n\nThey have also become popular East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and China, where they are sold in crêpe stands and kiosks. They are often served with whipped cream and fruits, or non-sweet spreads such as vegetables.\n\n\"Farinata\" are popular in Mediterranean regions, including Nice. Also called \"socca\", these are pancakes made from chickpea flour and seasoned with black pepper. They are popular street food in Nice.\n\nGerman pancakes are known as \"Pfannkuchen\" (from the German \"Pfanne\" and \"Kuchen\" meaning \"pan\" and \"cake\") except in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony, where \"Pfannkuchen\" are Berliner pastries and pancakes are known as \"Eierkuchen\". They are generally thicker than French-style crêpes and usually served with sweet or, occasionally, savoury fillings. Usage of a leavening agent or yeast is uncommon. Fried apple rings covered by pancake dough and served with sugar and cinnamon are called \"Apfelküchle\". \"Kaiserschmarrn\", a thick but light caramelized pancake popular in Bavaria and regions of the former Austria-Hungary, is usually split into pieces, filled with fruits or nuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a fruit sauce. It is believed that this was first prepared for Kaiser Franz Joseph I of Austria.\n\nIn Swabia, sliced pancake strips (\"flädle\") are often served in soup.\n\nEnglish pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though Gervase Markham's 1615 version in \"The English Huswife\" used water instead of milk, and added sweet spices. The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the frying pan when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to French crêpes and Italian crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with golden syrup, or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On Shrove Tuesday, it is custom to eat pancakes, and lemon juice and sugar may be added on top. Yorkshire pudding is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. Oatcakes are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with Staffordshire.\n\nPancakes (also called \"Scotch pancakes\" or \"Scottish pancakes\") are more like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also referred to as \"drop scones\" or \"dropped scones\". They are made from flour, eggs, sugar, buttermilk or milk, salt, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar. Smaller than American or English pancakes at about 3.5 in / 9 cm in diameter, they are made by the traditional method of dropping batter onto a griddle (a \"girdle\" in Northumberland or in Scots). They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In Scotland pancakes are generally served at teatime.\n\nWelsh pancakes, known as \"crempog\", \"ffroes\" and other names, vary considerably. Generally, they are thick and layered on top of each other to form a tall mock-Cake, but some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called \"crempog furum\") or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes. \"Crumpets\" and \"pikelets\" are sometimes considered a variety of pancake.\n\nGreek pancakes are called \"tiganites\" (\"τηγανίτες\", from the ancient Greek \"τηγανίτης\") and are popular across Greece and Cyprus. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with honey and cinnamon, and sometimes topped with cheese, nuts, fruits or vegetables. Various small shops in Cyprus called creperies sell crepes, either savoury or sweet varieties. Tiganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like Corfu and Patras are customarily served in the feast days of Saint Spyridon and Saint Andrew. In Cyprus the pancake recipe is used for a similar dish such as Genoese cannelloni – ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese, and sometimes bechamel sauce – instead of the traditional cannelloni dried pasta sold at supermarkets.\n\nIn Hungary, pancakes known as \"palacsinta\" (derived from the Latin \"placenta\") are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar, and eggs. Sweet wine may be added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa, or cinnamon powder, but meat and mushroom fillings are also used (see \"Hortobágyi palacsinta\"). \"Gundel palacsinta\" is a Hungarian pancake stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum that is served in chocolate sauce and is often flambéed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert.\n\nIcelandic crepe-like pancakes are called \"pönnukaka\" (pl. \"pönnukökur\"), whereas smaller, thicker and denser pancakes resembling North American pancakes are called \"lumma\" or \"skonsa\". The pancakes are usually a bit browner than traditional Swedish ones. \"Pönnukökur\" are usually cooked on a special Icelandic pancake pan, which is made to get the pancake as thin as possible, which is traditionally never washed or rinsed, not even with water. \"Pönnukökur\" are traditionally served rolled up with sugar or folded with jam and whipped cream, but if eaten at a café they might contain ice cream instead. Pönnukökur are also a popular dessert in North America among people of Icelandic descent.\n\nIn Iceland, North American-style pancakes are cut in half and used as sandwich bread, similar to Icelandic flatbread.\n\nIn the Netherlands, pancakes are known as \"pannenkoeken\" and are mostly eaten at lunch and dinner time. Pancake restaurants are popular with families and serve many sweet, savoury, and stuffed varieties. Pannenkoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large, or so in diameter. The batter is egg-based and fillings include such items as sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, and candied ginger, alone or in combination. \"Stroop\", a thick molasses-like sugar beet-based syrup is also popular, particularly in a classic filling of bacon and stroop. \"Poffertjes\" are another Dutch quick bread, similar to American pancakes but sweeter and much smaller. Made in a specially dimpled copper or cast iron pan, they are flipped once with a fork. Unlike Dutch pancakes, the batter for poffertjes contains baking powder and therefore they have a softer interior than pancakes. A spekdik is a pancake like-food which is traditionally eaten in the provinces Groningen and Drenthe in the Netherlands around New Year. Unlike pancakes, a spekdik is cooked with a waffle iron. The main ingredients of a spekdik are syrup, eggs and rye-flour, and some varieties include bacon.\n\nIn Poland, thin crêpe-style pancakes are called \"naleśniki\" (pronounced \"naleshniki\"). They are usually rolled and served with a variety of savoury or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. bilberries), jams (often apple jam), and soft white cheese with sugar. Savoury fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, spinach, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage or ham. Another Polish dish reassembling pancakes are \"racuchy\". They are smaller and thicker than \"naleśniki\" and can be stuffed with apple slices.\n\nSpanish pancakes are called \"frixuelos\" or \"filloas\" and are very popular in the north-west of Spain. They are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sugar or honey. They are a typical Carnival sweet dessert in Galicia, Asturias and León.\n\nNordic pancakes are similar to the French-style crêpes. In some Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, especially lingonberries (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called \"pannkakor\", which resemble the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine also has \"plättar\" — very small pancakes, which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are usually fried in a special pan called a \"plättlagg\", a sort of frying pan with indentations to allow for several (normally seven) to be made at once. Another type of pancake is the \"ugnspannkaka\" (oven pancake), which is very thick and resembles German pancakes, and is baked in the oven. There is also a variant which includes fried pork in the batter, \"fläskpannkaka\" (pork pancake). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing \"rårakor\"). \"Raggmunk\" and \"rårakor\" are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is \"saffron pancake\" from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special \"Swedish pancake\" is the \"äggakaka\" (eggcake), also called \"skånsk äggakaka\" (Scanian eggcake), which is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also much more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan, is about 1½ to 2 inches thick, and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry) or sugar.\n\nCosta Rican \"chorreadas\" are similar to \"cachapas\".\n\nGuatemalan pancakes are called \"panqueques\". They are made with the same ingredients as American pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on the region, the \"panqueque\" can be thin as a crêpe or as fluffy as a North American pancake.\n\nMexican \"hotcakes\" are similar to American pancakes. Crêpes became popular toward the end of the 19th century after their introduction by the French sometime between the First French Intervention (1838) and the Second French Intervention in Mexico (1861–67). Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal, as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country, and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns through the day. They are also sold during fairs; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as condensed milk, fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called \"cajeta\".\n\nAmerican and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called \"hotcakes\", \"griddlecakes\", or \"flapjacks\") are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three, topped with real or artificial maple syrup and butter. They are often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include jam, peanut butter, nuts, fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, cinnamon and sugar, and molasses. In addition, when a pancake is occasionally served as a dessert, toppings such as ice cream, chocolate syrup, and various fruits are often used.\n\nThe thick batter contains eggs, flour, milk, and a raising agent such as baking powder. The batter can have ingredients such as buttermilk, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg can also be used. Yogurt may be used to give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be ⅓ inch (1 cm) thick and about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.\n\n\"Bannock\" is common to virtually all North America's first peoples. The European version (Scotland) was traditionally made of oatmeal. The bannock of Aboriginal people was made of corn, nut meal and plant bulb meal. Each region had its own variation of flour and fruit. Today, bannock is most often deep-fried, pan-fried and oven-baked.\n\n\"Johnnycake\" (also \"jonnycake\", \"johnny cake\", \"journey cake\" or \"Johnny Bread\") is a cornmeal flatbread that was an early American staple food, and is still eaten in the West Indies and Bermuda. The modern johnnycake is stereotypically identified with today's Rhode Island foods, though they are a cultural staple in all of the northern US. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and frequently lightly sweetened.\n\n\"Yaniqueques\" or \"yanikeke\" are a Dominican Republic version of the johnnycake. They are a fried bread rather than a pancake, and are a popular beach food.\n\nSourdough was used by prospectors and pioneers to make pancakes without having to buy yeast. Prospectors would carry a pot of sourdough to make pancakes and bread, as it could last indefinitely, needing only flour and water to replenish it. Sourdough pancakes are now a particular specialty in Alaska. They are also found in many American pancake houses and restaurants elsewhere in America. \n\nA \"silver dollar pancake\" refers to a pancake about two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 silver dollar coins in the United States. This is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake. One serving usually consists of five to ten silver dollar pancakes.\n\n\"German pancakes\" or \"Dutch baby pancakes\" served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters. A David Eyre's pancake is a variation on the German pancake named for the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912–2008).\n\n\"Toutons\" are small, tall pancakes traditional in Newfoundland. They are usually served with dark molasses.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about 75 mm in diameter) known as \"pikelets\" are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam or whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea, but can also be served at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs, and a small amount of icing sugar.\n\nIn some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or English pancake-like pancakes (around in diameter) are served with butter, or butter and lemon, sugar, and then rolled up and eaten.\n\nAmerican-style pancakes are also popular. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, stewed fruits such as strawberries and cream, ice cream, or mascarpone.\n\n (), () or () are cassava (manioc) starch flour unleavened pancakes. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be eaten plain or with sweet or savoury toppings. Tapioca flour must be moistened and strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour. The heat of an ungreased hot griddle or pan makes the starchy grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a grainy pancake. Popular toppings include molten butter and dried, shredded coconut.\n\nThe exotic Brazilian pancake () is made from a mixture of coconut milk (, ) and (), a paste extracted from fermented cassava, most prominent in the cuisines of the Northern and Northeastern regions and relatively unknown elsewhere. The resulting product is significantly more watery, filling and strongly flavored than the unfermented , and care should be taken in rolling the pancakes if desired because it breaks very easily. Common toppings include molten butter and common sorts of savoury filling, but creative recipes might arise, such as fake lasagne.\n\nCachapas are corn pancakes, popular in Colombian and Venezuelan cuisine.\n\nIn the US, Mexico and Canada, the franchised restaurant chain International House of Pancakes (IHOP) serves pancakes all day. The Original Pancake House is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and Walker Brothers is a series of pancake houses in the Chicago area that developed as a franchised spin-off of The Original Pancake House.\n\nThe popularity of pancakes in Australia has spawned the Pancake Parlour and Pancakes on the Rocks franchised restaurants. In British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, the restaurant chain De Dutch serves Dutch and Flemish-style pannenkoeken.\n\nPancake syndrome is an allergic reaction which some people have after eating pancakes in tropical regions where certain mites can contaminate the flour in pancakes.\n\nPancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which is known as \"Pancake Day\" in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, and \"Pancake Tuesday\" in Ireland and Scotland. (Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No meat products should be eaten during Lent.\n\nCharity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a \"pancake race\" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of St Peter and St Paul's Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing her apron and headscarf. Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney and Liberal, Kansas have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.\n\nThe Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national brain injury charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "210486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210486", "title": "Fatback", "text": "Fatback\n\nFatback is a cut of meat from a domestic pig. It consists of the layer of adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat) under the skin of the back, with or without the skin (pork rind). Fatback is \"hard fat\", distinct from the visceral fat that occurs in the abdominal cavity and is called \"soft fat\" and leaf lard.\n\nLike other types of pig fat, fatback may be rendered to make a high quality lard, and is one source of salt pork. Finely diced or coarsely ground fatback is an important ingredient in sausage making and in some meat dishes.\n\nFatback is an important element of traditional charcuterie. In several European cultures it is used to make specialty bacon. Containing no skeletal muscle, this bacon is a delicacy.\n\nAt one time fatback was Italy's basic cooking fat, especially in regions where olive trees are sparse or absent, but health concerns have reduced its popularity. However, it provides a rich, authentic flavour for the classic battuto – sautéed vegetables, herbs and flavourings – that forms the basis of many traditional dishes. Today, pancetta is often used instead.\n\nFatback is processed into slab bacon by many methods, including brine curing, dry curing, smoking, or boiling. Usually the skin (rind) is left on.\n\nThis fatback bacon is widely eaten throughout Europe. In Italy it is called \"lardo\", and notable examples are Valle d'Aosta Lard d'Arnad and Lardo di Colonnata. In Ukraine, Russia, and other countries of the former Soviet Union, it is called \"salo\". In Hungary, where it is called \"szalonna\" and in Bulgaria, where it is called \"slanina\", it is very popular for campfire cookouts (\"szalonnasütés\"). In Germany, where it is called \"Rückenspeck\" (back pork fat), it is one of two cuts known as \"Speck\".\n\nFatback is a traditional part of southern US cuisine, soul food and traditional Cuisine of Quebec, where it is used for fried pork rinds (known there as cracklings, or Oreilles de crisse in Quebec), and to flavor stewed vegetables such as leaf vegetables, green beans, and black-eyed peas. A common delicacy is strips of heavily salted and fried fatback. Fatback was extremely popular in the South during the Great Depression because it is an inexpensive piece of meat. In the southwestern United States, fried fatback is known by its Spanish name, \"chicharrón\".\n\nFatback is an important ingredient in notable traditional sausages including nduja, cudighi, and cotechino Modena.\n\nIn French cooking, very thinly sliced fatback is used to line the mold when making a terrine or pâté, and thin strips of fatback are inserted under the skin of lean gamebirds for roasting. These techniques are barding and larding, respectively, and in both the fatback is used without the rind. Fatback also is used to make lardons, salt pork, and lard.\n\nThe 1954 rhythm and blues song \"Fat Back and Corn Liquor\" was written by Louisiana songwriter Rudy Toombs and sung by Louis Jordan.

The mixture is then allowed to go through a slow natural sweetening process before being baked in an oven until set with Maillard reaction. Preparation takes many hours, and after baking the mämmi is stored chilled for three to four days before being ready to eat. Instead of being allowed to sweeten naturally, traditionally, commercially made mämmi is usually seasoned with dark molasses. Traditional mämmi tastes aromatic sweet, having only up to 2% sugar, but commercially produced mämmi can have as much as 20% sugar and tastes different, not so aromatic sweet. Mämmi has up to 10% protein and is rich in trace elements. Mämmi was traditionally stored in small bowls made of birch bark called \"tuokkonen\" or \"rove\". Finnish packaging still prints birch bark-like texture on the carton boxes.\n\nGenerally, mämmi is eaten cold with either milk or cream and sugar, and less commonly with vanilla sauce. In olden times it was also eaten by some spread on top of a slice of bread. There is a Finnish society for mämmi founded by Ahmed Ladarsi, the former chef at the Italian Embassy in Helsinki, who has developed around fifty recipes containing mämmi. There are a number of websites with recipes using mämmi, most of which are in Finnish. Mämmi is also used as a minor ingredient in a mämmi-beer by Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas.\n\nMämmi was first mentioned during the 16th century, in a dissertation (in Latin). It is claimed that it has been eaten in the southwestern region of Finland, ever since the 13th century. \n\nOriginally mämmi was eaten during Lent. Its laxative properties were associated with purification and purging. As the dish keeps well for several days, it was also a convenient food for Good Friday, when cooking was against religious custom.\n\nNowadays Finns seldom make mämmi at home and most modern mämmi is mass-produced, traditional versions of mämmi are sold in Finland with the labels \"perinteinen\" (traditional) or \"luomu\" (organic). Some Finnish origin immigrants in North-America and Australia still make mämmi at home.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "212394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212394", "title": "Ghee", "text": "Ghee\n\nGhee (Sanskrit: Ghṛta), is a class of clarified butter that originated in ancient India. It is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine, cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asian cuisine, traditional medicine, and religious rituals.\n\nGhee is typically prepared by simmering butter, which is churned from cream (traditionally made by churning dahi), skimming any impurities from the surface, then pouring and retaining the clear liquid fat while discarding the solid residue that has settled to the bottom. Spices can be added for flavor. The texture, color and taste of ghee depends on the quality of the butter, the milk source used in the process and the duration of time spent boiling.\n\nThe word \"ghee\" comes from (\"\", ) 'clarified butter', from \"ghṛ-\" 'to sprinkle'.\n\nTraditionally, ghee () is always made from bovine milk, as cows are considered sacred, and it is a sacred requirement in Vedic \"yajña and homa\" (fire rituals), through the medium of Agni (fire) to offer oblations to various deities. (See Yajurveda).\n\nFire ritual have been performed dating back over 5,000 years. They are thought to be auspicious for ceremonies such as marriage, funerals, etc. Ghee is also necessary in Vedic worship of \"mūrtis\" (divine deities), with \"aarti\" (offering of ghee lamp) called\" diyā\" or \"dīpa\" and for \"Pañcāmṛta\" (Panchamruta) where ghee along with mishri (mishri is different from sugar), honey, milk, and \"dahi\" (curd) is used for bathing the deities on the appearance day of Krishna on Janmashtami, \"Śiva\" (Shiva) on \"Mahā-śivarātrī\" (Maha Shivaratri). There is a hymn to ghee.\n\nIn the \"Mahabharata\", the \"kaurava\" were born from pots of ghee.\nFinding ghee pure enough to use for sacred purposes is a problem these days for devout Hindus, since many large-scale producers add salt to their product. Ghee is also used in bhang in order to heat the cannabis to cause decarboxylation, making the drink psychoactive.\n\nGhee is common in cuisines from the Indian subcontinent, including traditional rice preparations (such as \"biryani\"). In Maharashtra, polis or Indian breads are accompanied with ghee. For example, 'Puranpoli', a typical Maharashtrian dish is eaten with lots of ghee. In Rajasthan, ghee often accompanies \"baati\". All over north India, ghee tops \"roti\". In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, ghee tops dosa, and kesari bhath. In Bengal (both West Bengal and Bangladesh) and Gujarat, \"khichdi\" is a traditional evening meal of rice with lentils, cooked in curry made from dahi (yogurt), cumin seeds, curry leaves, cornflour, turmeric, garlic, salt and ghee. It is also an ingredient in \"kadhi\" and Indian sweets, such as \"Mysore pak\" and varieties of \"halva\" and \"laddu\". Pakistani and Punjabi restaurants typically incorporate large amounts of ghee, sometimes brushing \"naan\" and \"roti\" with it, either during preparation or just before serving. In the state of Odisha ghee is widely used in regional Odia cusines such as 'Khechedi' and 'Dalma'. Particularly the satwik type of food prepared in almost temples in Odisha use a ghee as a major ingredient for their culnary skills. Ghee is widely used in South Indian cuisine for tempering curries, in preparation of rice dishes and sweets. South Indians have a habit of adding ghee to their rice before eating it with pickles and curries. South Indians are one of the biggest consumers of ghee. The people from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh especially use ghee for preparation of savoury and sweet dishes alike. Ghee is important to traditional Punjabi cuisine, with \"parathas, daals\" and curries often using ghee instead of oil for a richer taste. The type of ghee, in terms of animal source, tends to vary with the dish; for example, ghee prepared from cow's milk () is traditional with rice or \"roti\" or as a finishing drizzle atop a curry or \"daal\" (lentils) whereas buffalo-milk ghee is more typical for general cooking purposes.\n\nGhee is an ideal fat for deep frying because its smoke point (where its molecules begin to break down) is 250 °C (482 °F), which is well above typical cooking temperatures of around 200 °C (392 °F) and above that of most vegetable oils.\n\nThe main flavor components of ghee are carbonyls, free fatty acids, lactones, and alcohols. Along with the flavor of milk fat, the ripening of the butter and temperature at which it is clarified also affect the flavor. For example, ghee produced by the clarification of butter at 100 °C or less results in a mild flavor, whereas batches produced at 120 °C produce a strong flavor.\n\nGhee differs slightly in its production. The process of creating traditional clarified butter is complete once the water is evaporated and the fat (clarified butter) is separated from the milk solids. However, the production of ghee includes simmering the butter, which makes it nutty-tasting and aromatic.\n\nA traditional Ayurvedic recipe for ghee is to boil raw milk, let it cool to 110 °F (43 °C). After letting it sit covered at room temperature for around 12 hours, add a bit of dahi (yogurt) to it and let it sit overnight. This makes more yogurt. This is churned with water, to obtain cultured butter, which is used to simmer into ghee.\n\nAyurveda considers pure ghee to be \"sāttvik\" or \"sattva-guṇi\" (in the \"mode of goodness\"), when used as food. It is the main ingredient in some of the Ayurvedic medicines, and is included under \"catuh mahā sneha\" (the four main oils: \"ghṛta, taila, vasā\", and \"majjā\") along with sesame oil, muscle fat, and bone marrow. Though eight types of ghee are mentioned in Ayurvedic classics, ghee made of human breast milk and cow's ghee are favored. Ghee is also used in Ayurvedas for constipation and ulcers.\n\nIn Sri Lankan indigenous medical traditions (\"Deshīya Cikitsā\"), ghee is included in \"pas tel\" (five oils: ghee, margosa oil, sesame oil, castor oil, and butter tree oil).\n\nLike any clarified butter, ghee is composed almost entirely of fat, 62% of which consists of saturated fats. It is also rich in oxidized cholesterol: 259 μg/g, or 12.3% of total cholesterol. Ghee is also sometimes called \"desi\" (country-made) ghee or \"asli\" (genuine) ghee to distinguish it from the modern \"vegetable ghee\".\n\nSeveral communities outside the Indian subcontinent make ghee. Egyptians make a product called \"samna baladi\", meaning \"countryside butter\" identical to ghee in terms of process and result, but commonly made from water buffalo milk instead of cow milk, and white in color. Also, during the process, the darkened milk solids are considered a delicacy called morta which is a salty condiment used sparingly as a spread, or as an addition on fava dishes. Regular samna is also made from cow milk in Egypt and is often yellowish.\n\nGhee is also used by various peoples in the Horn of Africa. Tesmi (in Tigrinya language) is the clarified butter prepared in the country of Eritrea. The preparation is similar to that of ghee but the butter is oftentimes combined with garlic and other spices found native to the area. In Ethiopia, \"niter kibbeh\" is used in much the same way as ghee, but with spices added during the process that result in distinctive tastes. In North Africa, Maghrebis take this one step further, aging spiced ghee for months or even years, resulting in a product called \"smen\".\n\nIn northeastern Brazil, an unrefrigerated butter similar to ghee, called \"manteiga-de-garrafa\" (butter-in-a-bottle) or \"manteiga-da-terra\" (butter of the land), is common.\n\nIn Switzerland as well as bordering areas, butter was rendered in the old days to preserve the product for several months without refrigeration. \"Boiled butter\", as it is commonly called, is used extensively to finish a typical dish of \"rösti\", the Swiss version of hash browns. It gives the dish a distinct flavor in baking of various pastor use in baked goods as a substitute for fresh butter to enhance flavor.\n\nThere are 4 common methods through which ghee is prepared. Industrial preparation on the other hand by FMCG companies such as Patanjali is done by using \"white butter\", usually sourced from other dairies and contractors.\n\nSour raw milk is churned into butter. The butter is boiled in an open pan to allow the water to evaporate. The hot ghee is transferred and stored.\n\nFresh cream, cultured or washed cream is directly converted to ghee. This method requires a long heating time and produces a caramelized flavor.\n\nMilk is separated into cream which is then churned into butter. The butter undergoes heat clarification to produce ghee.\n\nSuitable for large quantities of butter. Butter is melted at 80-85 °C for 30 minutes. Layers of protein particles, fat and buttermilk are induced. The buttermilk is drained out. The remaining layers of fat are heated to a temperature of 110 °C to remove moisture and develop flavor.\n\nGhee is generally found to be packaged in airtight glass jars. They should be kept away from direct sunlight as sunlight can cause moisture to build inside the jar. Moisture can cause deterioration to the ghee's quality as well as reduce its shelf life. To prevent the acceleration of the oxidation process, they should be protected from anything that causes it, such as UV rays from the sunlight and fluorescent lights. If the jar is unopened, it does not need to be refrigerated as long as the previously mentioned conditions are met. Once opened, they can be stored in a kitchen cabinet for up to 3 months. Afterwards, it may be left in the refrigerator for up to a year. The refrigerator causes ghee to harden but if it is left at room temperature for a while, it will soften up again.\n\nGhee may be made of milk from various domesticated ungulates, such as cows and sheep. The composition of ghee varies depending on the animal whose milk has been used. The vitamin A content ranged from 315 to 375 international units per 100 grams. Palmitic acid and oleic acid were two of the main fatty acids found in both cow and sheep ghee. The saturated fatty acid profile was 53.9 to 66.8 percent, the unsaturated fatty acid profile was 22.8 to 38.0 and the other fatty acids was 3.5 to 10.4. Cholesterol amounts ranged from 252 to 284 mg/100 grams.\n\nThe market size of ghee in India is 10,000 crores or US$1.5 Billion as of 2016. India is the world's largest producer of buffalo and cow milk and consequently also the largest producer and consumer of ghee.\n\n"}
{"id": "212490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212490", "title": "Subatomic particle", "text": "Subatomic particle\n\nIn the physical sciences, subatomic particles are particles much smaller than atoms. The two types of subatomic particles are: elementary particles, which according to current theories are not made of other particles; and \"composite\" particles. Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact.\nThe idea of a particle underwent serious rethinking when experiments showed that light could behave like a stream of particles (called photons) as well as exhibiting wave-like properties. This led to the new concept of wave–particle duality to reflect that quantum-scale \"particles\" behave like both particles and waves (they are sometimes described as wavicles to reflect this). Another new concept, the uncertainty principle, states that some of their properties taken together, such as their simultaneous position and momentum, cannot be measured exactly. In more recent times, wave–particle duality has been shown to apply not only to photons but to increasingly massive particles as well.\n\nInteractions of particles in the framework of quantum field theory are understood as creation and annihilation of \"quanta\" of corresponding fundamental interactions. This blends particle physics with field theory.\n\nAny subatomic particle, like any particle in the three-dimensional space that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics, can be either a boson (with integer spin) or a fermion (with odd half-integer spin).\n\nThe elementary particles of the Standard Model include:\nVarious extensions of the Standard Model predict the existence of an elementary graviton particle and many other elementary particles.\n\nComposite subatomic particles (such as protons or atomic nuclei) are bound states of two or more elementary particles. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while the atomic nucleus of helium-4 is composed of two protons and two neutrons. The neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. Composite particles include all hadrons: these include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons (such as pions and kaons).\n\nIn special relativity, the energy of a particle at rest equals its mass times the speed of light squared, \"E\" = \"mc\". That is, mass can be expressed in terms of energy and vice versa. If a particle has a frame of reference in which it lies at rest, then it has a positive rest mass and is referred to as \"massive\".\n\nAll composite particles are massive. Baryons (meaning \"heavy\") tend to have greater mass than mesons (meaning \"intermediate\"), which in turn tend to be heavier than leptons (meaning \"lightweight\"), but the heaviest lepton (the tau particle) is heavier than the two lightest flavours of baryons (nucleons). It is also certain that any particle with an electric charge is massive.\n\nAll massless particles (particles whose invariant mass is zero) are elementary. These include the photon and gluon, although the latter cannot be isolated.\n\nThrough the work of Albert Einstein, Satyendra Nath Bose, Louis de Broglie, and many others, current scientific theory holds that \"all\" particles also have a wave nature. This has been verified not only for elementary particles but also for compound particles like atoms and even molecules. In fact, according to traditional formulations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, wave–particle duality applies to all objects, even macroscopic ones; although the wave properties of macroscopic objects cannot be detected due to their small wavelengths.\n\nInteractions between particles have been scrutinized for many centuries, and a few simple laws underpin how particles behave in collisions and interactions. The most fundamental of these are the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, which let us make calculations of particle interactions on scales of magnitude that range from stars to quarks. These are the prerequisite basics of Newtonian mechanics, a series of statements and equations in \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", originally published in 1687.\n\nThe negatively charged electron has a mass equal to of that of a hydrogen atom. The remainder of the hydrogen atom's mass comes from the positively charged proton. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its nucleus. Neutrons are neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of the proton. Different isotopes of the same element contain the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons. The mass number of an isotope is the total number of nucleons (neutrons and protons collectively).\n\nChemistry concerns itself with how electron sharing binds atoms into structures such as crystals and molecules. Nuclear physics deals with how protons and neutrons arrange themselves in nuclei. The study of subatomic particles, atoms and molecules, and their structure and interactions, requires quantum mechanics. Analyzing processes that change the numbers and types of particles requires quantum field theory. The study of subatomic particles \"per se\" is called particle physics. The term \"high-energy physics\" is nearly synonymous to \"particle physics\" since creation of particles requires high energies: it occurs only as a result of cosmic rays, or in particle accelerators. Particle phenomenology systematizes the knowledge about subatomic particles obtained from these experiments.\n\nThe term \"\"subatomic\" particle\" is largely a retronym of the 1960s, used to distinguish a large number of baryons and mesons (which comprise hadrons) from particles that are now thought to be truly elementary. Before that hadrons were usually classified as \"elementary\" because their composition was unknown.\n\nA list of important discoveries follows:\n\n\n\n"}

Quiche can be served hot or cold. It is part of French cuisine but is also popular in other countries, particularly as party food.\n\nThe word is first attested in French in 1805, and in 1605 in Lorrain patois. The first English usage — \"quiche Lorraine\" — was recorded in the \"Indiana Evening Gazette\" in 1925. The further etymology is uncertain but it may be related to the German \"\" meaning \"cake\" or \"tart\".\n\nQuiche is considered a French dish; however, using eggs and cream in pastry was practiced in English cuisine at least as early as the 14th century and Italian cuisine at least as early as the 13th century.

{"id": "213589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213589", "title": "Pretzel", "text": "Pretzel\n\nA pretzel () () () is a type of baked bread product made from dough most commonly shaped into a twisted knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive nonsymmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back into itself in a certain way (a pretzel loop). In modern times, pretzels come in a range of different shapes. \n\nSalt is the most common seasoning for pretzels, complementing the washing soda or lye treatment that gives pretzels their traditional skin and flavor through the Maillard reaction; other seasonings include various cheeses, sugars, chocolate, glazes, seeds, or nuts. There are several varieties of pretzels, including soft pretzels, which must be eaten shortly after preparation, and hard-baked pretzels, which have a long shelf life. \n\nPretzels originated in Europe centuries before Christ's birth, although popular stories claim that the pretzel was invented by a monk to represent arms crossed in prayer to the Trinity.\n\nThere are numerous unreliable accounts regarding the origin of pretzels, as well as the origin of the name; most assume that they have Christian backgrounds and were invented by European monks. According to legend, as cited by several sources, including \"The History of Science and Technology\", by Bryan Bunch and Alexander Hellemans, in 610 AD \"... [a]n Italian monk invents pretzels as a reward to children who learn their prayers. He calls the strips of baked dough, folded to resemble arms crossing the chest, 'pretiola' (\"little reward[s]\")\". However, there is no known historical evidence to verify this claim. Another source locates the invention in a monastery in southern France. In Germany, there are stories that pretzels were the invention of desperate bakers held hostage by local dignitaries. \n\nHowever popular these stories have been, the pretzel's origin is pagan, and pre-dates Christianity. \"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" from 1905 speculated that the origin of pretzels came in a ban of heathen baking traditions, such as in the form of a sun cross, at the Synod of Estinnes in the year 743. The pretzel may have emerged as a substitute. Modern scholars identify it as a symbol of human sacrifice to a Celtic water deity named Sirona. The three holes in the pretzel represent the nooses used to kill the three people during the sacrifice.\nThe German name \"\"Brezel\"\" may derive also from Latin \"bracellus\" (a medieval term for \"bracelet\"), or \"bracchiola\" (\"little arms\").\n\nThe pretzel has been in use as an emblem of bakers and formerly their guilds in southern German areas since at least the 12th century. A 12th-century illustration in the \"Hortus deliciarum\" from the southwest German Alsace region (today France) may contain the earliest depiction of a pretzel. \n\nWithin the Christian Church, pretzels were regarded as having religious significance for both ingredients and shape. Pretzels made with a simple recipe using only flour and water could be eaten during Lent when Christians were forbidden to eat eggs, lard, or dairy products such as milk and butter. As time passed, pretzels became associated with both Lent and Easter. Pretzels were hidden on Easter morning just as eggs are hidden today, and are particularly associated with Lent, fasting, and prayers before Easter.\n\nLike the holes in the hubs of round Swedish flat bread (which let them be hung on strings), the loops in pretzels may have served a practical purpose: bakers could hang them on sticks, for instance, projecting upwards from a central column, as shown in a painting by Job Berckheyde (1630–93) from around 1681.\n\nPretzel baking has most firmly taken root in the region of Franconia and adjoining Upper German-speaking areas, and pretzels have been an integral part of German baking traditions for centuries. Lye pretzels are popular in southern Germany, Alsace, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland as a variety of bread, a side dish or a snack, and come in many local varieties. Almost every region and even city has its own way of baking them. Examples for pretzel names in various Upper-German dialects are \"Breze\", \"Brezn\", \"Bretzel\", \"Brezzl\", \"Brezgen\", \"Bretzga\", \"Bretzet\", \"Bretschl\", \"Kringel\", \"Silserli,\" and \"Sülzerli\". Baked for consumption on the same day, they are sold in every bakery and in special booths or stands in downtown streets. Often, they are sliced horizontally, buttered, and sold as \"Butterbrezel\", or come with slices of cold meats or cheese. Sesame, poppy, sunflower, pumpkin, or caraway seeds, melted cheese, and bacon bits are other popular toppings. Some bakeries offer pretzels made of different flours, such as whole wheat, rye or spelt. \n\nIn Bavaria, lye pretzels accompany a main dish, such as Weisswurst sausage. The same dough and baking procedure with lye and salt is used to make other kinds of \"lye pastry\" (\"Laugengebäck\"): lye rolls, buns, croissants, and even loaves (\"Laugenbrötchen\", \"Laugenstangen\", \"Laugencroissants\", \"Laugenbrot\"). Yet, in some parts of Bavaria, especially in lower Bavaria, unglazed \"white\" pretzels, sprinkled with salt and caraway seeds are still popular. Basically, with the same ingredients, lye pretzels come in numerous local varieties. Sizes are usually similar; the main differences are the thickness of the dough, the content of fat and the degree of baking. Typical Swabian pretzels, for example, have very thin \"arms\" and a \"fat belly\" with a split, and a higher fat content. The thicker part makes it easier to slice them for the use of sandwiches. In Bavarian pretzels, the arms are left thicker so they do not bake to a crisp and contain very little fat.\n\nThe pretzel shape is used for a variety of sweet pastries made of different types of dough (flaky, brittle, soft, crispy) with a variety of toppings (icing, nuts, seeds, cinnamon). Around Christmas, they can be made of soft gingerbread (\"Lebkuchen\") with chocolate coating. In southern Germany and adjoining German-speaking areas, pretzels have retained their original religious meanings and are still used in various traditions and festivals. In some areas, on January 1, people give each other lightly sweetened yeast pretzels for good luck and good fortune. These \"New Year's pretzels\" are made in different sizes and can have a width of and more. Sometimes children visit their godparents to fetch their New Years pretzel. On May 1, love-struck boys used to paint a pretzel on the doors of the adored. On the other hand, an upside-down pretzel would have been a sign of disgrace. Especially Catholic areas, such as Austria, Bavaria, or some parts of Swabia, the \"Palm pretzel\" is made for Palm Sunday celebrations. Sizes can range from up to and they can weigh up to . An old tradition on Palm Sunday dating back to 1533 is the outdoor pretzel market (\"Brezgenmarkt\") in the Hungerbrunnen Valley near Heldenfingen.\n\nIn the Rhineland region, sweet pretzels are made with pudding-filled loops (pudding pretzels). On Laetare Sunday in Luxembourg, the fourth Sunday in Lent, there is a festival called \"Pretzel Sunday\". Boys give their girlfriends pretzels or cakes in pretzel form. The size symbolizes how much he likes her. In return, if a girl wants to increase his attention, she will give him a decorated egg on Easter. The pretzel custom is reversed on Pretzel Sunday during leap years. This custom also still exists in some areas of the Swabian Alb. On the same occasion in Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate, people have parades carrying big pretzels mounted on colourful decorated poles.\n\nDuring Lent in Biberach, \"Lent pretzels\" are popular. These are shortly boiled in water before baking and afterwards sprinkled with salt. Schloss Burg is renowned for a 200-year-old speciality, the \"Burger pretzel\". Its texture and flavour resembles rusk or zwieback. A local story says that the recipe came from a grateful Napoleonic soldier in 1795, whose wounds were treated by a baker's family in the little town of Burg. The cultural importance of the pretzel for Burg is expressed by a monument in honour of the pretzel bakers, and by an 18 km hiking trail nearby called \"Pretzel Hiking Trail\".\n\nA variety typical for Upper Franconia is the \"anise pretzel\". The town of Weidenberg celebrates the \"Pretzel weeks\" during the carnival season when anise flavored pretzels are served with special dishes such as cooked meat with horseradish or roast.\nIn the city of Lübeck, the 500-year-old guild of boatmen on the Stecknitz Canal call their annual meetings in January \"Kringelhöge\" (Pretzelfun). The elaborate affair, with about 200 participants, is celebrated as a breakfast with beer and includes Mass in the Lübeck Cathedral and a presentation of songs by a children's choir. In earlier times, the children were very poor, coming from an orphanage, and each received a \"Kringel\" (pretzel) as a reward. Hence, the name \"Pretzelfun\" was adopted, because this gift was considered a highlight. Today, the children come from schools, but they still get the pretzels.\n\nThe city of Osnabrück celebrates the anniversary of the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and organizes an annual hobby horse race for grade-four children. On finishing the race, they are presented with a sweet pretzel. In heraldry, the city seal of Nörten dates from around 1550 and depicts two facing lions holding a pretzel at the center.\n\nThe lye pretzel is the theme for a number of festivals in Germany. The city of Speyer prides itself to be the \"pretzel town\", and around the second weekend of July, from Friday to Tuesday, it holds an annual funfair and festival called \"\"Brezelfest\"\", which is the largest beer festival in the Upper Rhine region, and attracts around 300,000 visitors. The festival includes a parade with over 100 bands, floats, and clubs participating from the whole region, and 22,000 pretzels are thrown among the crowds. On the market square of Speyer, there is a fountain with a statue of a boy selling pretzels. The pretzel booths on the main street are permanently installed and were specially designed when the whole downtown area was redone for the 2000th anniversary. One-day pretzel fests and markets in other German towns are in Kirchhellen, a borough of Bottrop, or in Kornwestheim. In 2003 and 2004, \"Peace Pretzels\" were baked for a UNICEF charity event and other charity purposes in Munich. Instead of the typical pretzel loop, they were made in the similar shape of a peace symbol.\n\nIn the late 18th century, southern German and Swiss German immigrants introduced the pretzel to North America. The immigrants became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, and in time, many handmade pretzel bakeries populated the central Pennsylvania countryside, and the pretzel's popularity spread.\nIn the 20th century, soft pretzels became popular in other regions of the United States. Cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York became renowned for their soft pretzels. The key to success was the introduction of the new mass production methods of the industrialized age, which increased the availability and quantity, and the opening up of multiple points of distribution at schools, convenience and grocery stores, and entertainment venues such as movie theaters, arenas, concert halls, and sport stadiums. Prior to that, street vendors used to sell pretzels on street corners in wooden glass-enclosed cases.\n\nIn particular, the S-shaped soft pretzel, often served with brown mustard, became very popular in Philadelphia and was established as a part of Philadelphia's cuisine for snacking at school, work, or home, and considered by most to be a quick meal. The average Philadelphian today consumes about twelve times as many pretzels as the national average. Pennsylvania is the center of American pretzel production for both the hard-crispy and the soft-bread types of pretzels. Southeastern Pennsylvania, with its large population of German background, is considered the birthplace of the American pretzel industry, and many pretzel bakers are still located in the area. Pennsylvania produces 80% of the nation's pretzels.\n\nThe annual United States pretzel industry is worth over $550 million. The average American consumes about of pretzels per year. The privately run \"Pretzel Museum\" opened in Philadelphia in 1993. In 2003, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell declared April 26 \"National Pretzel Day\" to acknowledge the importance of the pretzel to the state's history and economy. Philly Pretzel Factory stores offer a free pretzel to each customer on this day.\nHard pretzels originated in the United States, where, in 1850, the Sturgis bakery in Lititz, Pennsylvania, became the first commercial hard pretzel bakery. Snack food hard pretzels are made in the form of loops, braids, letters, little pretzels, or sticks around thick and long; they have become a popular snack in many countries around the world. A thicker variety of sticks can be thick; in the U. S. these are called Bavarian pretzels or pretzel rods. Unlike the soft pretzels, these were durable when kept in an airtight environment and marketable in a variety of convenience stores. Large-scale production began in the first half of the 1900s, more so during 1930 to 1950. A prime example was in 1949, when highly innovative American Machine and Foundry Co., of New York City, developed the \"pretzel bender\": a new automatic crispy-styled baked pretzel-twisting machine that rolled and tied them at the rate of 50 a minute—more than twice as fast as skilled hand twisters could make them—and conveyed them through the baking and salting process. \n\nIn Europe, snack-food pretzels are usually sprinkled with salt, but also with sesame seed, poppy seed, or cheese. In the U.S., they come in many varieties of flavors and coatings, such as yogurt, chocolate, strawberry, mustard, cheese and others, and chocolate-covered hard pretzels are popular around Christmas time and given as gifts. The variety of shapes and sizes became contest of imagination in the marketing of the pretzels taste. During the 1900s, people in Philadelphia would use the small slender pretzel stick as a common accompaniment to ice cream or would crumble pretzels as a topping. This combination of cold sweet and salty taste was very popular for many years. Eventually, this led to the development of an ice cream cone tasting like a pretzel. More recently Mars, Incorporated manufactures M&M's with a small spherical pretzel covered in milk chocolate and candy coated in all of the standard M&M's colors, called \"Pretzel M&M's\". Soft pretzels are frequently sold in shopping malls, with notable chains including Auntie Anne's and Pretzelmaker/Pretzel Time.\n\n\nFreeport, Illinois, which sits about 100 miles outside of Chicago, is another city known for its rich pretzel history. In 1869, a German immigrant named John Billerbeck established the first Billerbeck Bakery which was known for selling German style pretzels to compliment the large number of breweries that existed in Freeport during this time. Prohibition eventually shut down the breweries which led to the decline of pretzel sales in Freeport, but the city never lost its pretzel pride. For more than 100 years, Freeport has been known as \"Pretzel City, USA.\" Their high school athletic mascot is the Pretzel and the football stadium has been appropriately named \"Pretzel Field.\" In 2003, local citizens launched Freeport's first Pretzel Festival which is a large community event where residents get together to celebrate the city's pretzel history. Contestants are chosen to be crowned Pretzel Prince and Princess and a festival mascot by the name of \"Pretzel Bill\" (stemming from the Billerbeck Bakery name) dresses as a 6-foot tall walking talking pretzel who hands out pretzels from floats and takes photos with the local festival goers.\n\nAlthough not as popular as among German speakers and Americans, the looped pretzel is known in other European countries and in other countries around the world. In the Czech Republic, the pretzel is known as \"preclík\", in Finland as \"viipurinrinkeli\", in Slovakia, it is called \"praclík\". The Spanish, French call it \"bretzel\", the Italian \"brezel\", the Dutch favor sweet variants called \"krakeling\", Norwegian and Danish call it a \"kringle\", and the Swedish call it \"kringla\". In Polish it is \"precel\", in Hungarian and Croatian it is \"perec\", and in Serbian it is \"pereca\". In Romania, the pretzel is known as a variety of \"covrigi\" and it is a very popular fast food in urban areas and also as a holiday gift.\n\nThe pretzel has become an element in popular culture, both as a food staple, and its unique knotted twist shape which has inspired ideas, perspectives, attitudes, memes, images, and other phenomena. Although historically, the pretzel has influenced culture, it has recently been heavily influenced by mass media.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "213926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213926", "title": "HP Sauce", "text": "HP Sauce\n\nHP Sauce is a brown sauce originally produced by HP Foods in the United Kingdom, now produced by the H. J. Heinz Company in the Netherlands. It was named after London's Houses of Parliament. Since its first appearance on British dinner tables, HP Sauce has become an icon of British culture. It was the best-selling brand of brown sauce in the UK in 2005, with 73.8% of the retail market.\n\nHP Sauce has a tomato base, blended with malt vinegar and spirit vinegar, sugars (molasses, glucose-fructose syrup, sugar), dates, cornflour, rye flour, salt, spices and tamarind. It is used as a condiment with hot and cold savoury food, and as an ingredient in soups and stews. It is also popular in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nThe picture on the front of the bottle is a selection of famous London landmarks including Big Ben, the Palace of Westminster and Westminster Bridge.\n\nThe original recipe for HP Sauce was invented and developed by Frederick Gibson Garton, a grocer from Nottingham. He registered the name H.P. Sauce in 1895. Garton called the sauce HP because he had heard that a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it. For many years the bottle labels have carried a picture of the Houses of Parliament. Garton sold the recipe and HP brand to Edwin Samson Moore for the sum of £150 and the settlement of some unpaid bills. Moore, the founder of the Midlands Vinegar Company (the forerunner of HP Foods), subsequently launched HP Sauce in 1903. In 2013, nearly 140 years after its establishment, the Midland Vinegar Company Limited returned to the originator's family, with Nigel Britton, great-great-grandson of the founders, now being the owner.\n\nFor many years the description on the label was in both English and French. The factory in Aston, Birmingham, was once bisected by the A38(M) motorway and had a pipeline, carrying vinegar over the motorway, from the Top Yard to the main Tower Road factory site. The Top Yard site was subsequently closed, and vinegar was no longer brewed on the Aston site during the last few years of production there.\n\nHP Sauce became known as \"Wilson's gravy\" in the 1960s and 1970s after Harold Wilson, the Labour Prime Minister. The name arose after Wilson's wife, Mary, gave an interview to \"The Sunday Times\" in which she said: \"If Harold has a fault, it is that he will drown everything with HP Sauce.\"\n\nHP Sauce is available in a range of formats and sizes, including the iconic 8.99oz/255g glass bottle, plastic squeeze bottle, and TopDown bottle.\n\nAlso the ingredients vary markedly. In 2007 for example the varieties from Mexico and Canada were lighter and less concentrated.\nIn addition, a number of other products exist under the HP brand.\n\nThe brand was passed from the Midlands Vinegar Company to Smedley HP Foods Limited, acquired by a division of Imperial Tobacco, then sold to the French Groupe Danone SA in 1988 for £199 million.\n\nIn June 2005, Heinz purchased the parent company, HP Foods, from Danone. In October of that year the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading referred the takeover to the Competition Commission, which approved the £440 million acquisition in April 2006.\n\nIn May 2006, Heinz announced plans to switch production of HP Sauce from Aston to its European sauces facility in Elst, Netherlands, only weeks after HP launched a campaign to \"Save the Proper British Cafe\". The announcement prompted a call to boycott Heinz products. The move, resulting in the loss of approximately 125 jobs at the Aston factory, was criticised by politicians and union officials, especially as the parent company still wanted to use the image of the House of Commons on its bottles. In the same month, local Labour MP Khalid Mahmood brandished a bottle of HP Sauce during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons as part of a protest against the Heinz move. He also made reference to the sauce's popularity with the former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson. These plans were confirmed on 23 August 2006 and the factory at Aston ceased production on 16 March 2007. A week later a \"wake\" was held at the location of the factory.\n\nThe factory was demolished in the summer of 2007. The tower of the factory had been a famous landmark alongside the Aston Expressway. One of the giant logos from the top of the tower is now in the collection of Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery.\n\nThe six-acre Aston site was purchased by developer Chancerygate in 2007 at £800,000 per acre; they subsequently sold it for half that price and it now houses a distribution warehouse for East End Foods.\n\nHP Sauce for the Canadian market is manufactured by H. J. Heinz of North York, Ontario.\n\n"}
{"id": "214049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214049", "title": "Bagel", "text": "Bagel\n\nA bagel ( '; ), also spelled beigel, is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland.\nIt is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are generally eaten untoasted, as they have already been cooked. However, toasted bagels are also a popular choice for consumers. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.\n\nThough the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed by Ashkenazi Jews from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland.\n\nBagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with alternative ways of making them. Like other bakery products, bagels are available (fresh or frozen, often in many flavors) in many major supermarkets in those cities.\n\nThe basic roll-with-a-hole design is hundreds of years old and has other practical advantages besides providing more even cooking and baking of the dough: The hole could be used to thread string or dowels through groups of bagels, allowing easier handling and transportation and more appealing seller displays.\n\nLinguist Leo Rosten wrote in \"The Joys of Yiddish\" about the first known mention of the Polish word \"bajgiel\" derived from the Yiddish word \"bagel\" in the \"Community Regulations\" of the city of Kraków in 1610, which stated that the food was given as a gift to women in childbirth.\n\nIn the 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the \"bajgiel\" became a staple of Polish cuisine and a staple of the Slavic diet generally. Its name derives from the Yiddish word \"beygal\" from the German dialect word \"beugel\", meaning \"ring\" or \"bracelet\".\n\nVariants of the word \"beugal\" are used in Yiddish and in Austrian German to refer to a similar form of sweet-filled pastry (\"Mohnbeugel\" (with poppy seeds) and \"Nussbeugel\" (with ground nuts), or in southern German dialects (where \"beuge\" refers to a pile, e.g., \"holzbeuge\" \"woodpile\"). According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, 'bagel' derives from the transliteration of the Yiddish\" 'beygl',\" which came from the Middle High German 'böugel' or ring, which itself came from 'bouc' (ring) in Old High German, similar to the Old English \"bēag\" \"ring\" and \"būgan\" \"to bend, bow\". Similarly, another etymology in the Webster's New World College Dictionary says that the Middle High German form was derived from the Austrian German \"beugel\", a kind of croissant, and was similar to the German \"bügel\", a stirrup or ring.\n\nIn the Brick Lane district and surrounding area of London, England, bagels (locally spelled \"beigels\") have been sold since the middle of the 19th century. They were often displayed in the windows of bakeries on vertical wooden dowels, up to a metre in length, on racks.\nBagels were brought to the United States by immigrant Polish Jews, with a thriving business developing in New York City that was controlled for decades by Bagel Bakers Local 338. They had contracts with nearly all bagel bakeries in and around the city for its workers, who prepared all their bagels by hand.\n\nThe bagel came into more general use throughout North America in the last quarter of the 20th century with automation. Daniel Thompson started work on the first commercially viable bagel machine in 1958; bagel baker Harry Lender, his son, Murray Lender, and Florence Sender leased this technology and pioneered automated production and distribution of frozen bagels in the 1960s. Murray also invented pre-slicing the bagel.\n\nAround 1900, the \"bagel brunch\" became popular in New York City. The bagel brunch consists of a bagel topped with lox, cream cheese, capers, tomato, and red onion. This and similar combinations of toppings have remained associated with bagels into the 21st century in the US.\n\nIn Japan, the first kosher bagels were brought by from New York in 1989. BagelK created green tea, chocolate, maple-nut, and banana-nut flavors for the market in Japan. There are three million bagels exported from the U.S. annually, and it has a 4%-of-duty classification of Japan in 2000. Some Japanese bagels, such as those sold by , are soft and sweet; others, such as Einstein Bro. bagels sold by Costco in Japan, are the same as in the U.S.\n\nAt its most basic, traditional bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred to create the firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. Most bagel recipes call for the addition of a sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, or sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.\n\nBagels are traditionally made by:\n\nThis production method gives bagels their distinctive taste, chewy texture, and shiny appearance.\n\nIn recent years, a variant has emerged, producing what is sometimes called the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.\n\nBagels can be frozen for up to six months.\n\nAccording to a 2012 \"Consumer Reports\" article, the ideal bagel should have a slightly crispy crust, a distinct \"pull\" when a piece is separated from the whole by biting or pinching, a chewy inside, and the flavor of bread freshly baked. The taste may be complemented by additions cooked on the bagel, such as onion, garlic, sesame seeds, or poppy seeds. The appeal of a bagel may change upon being toasted. Toasting can have the effect of bringing or removing desirable chewiness, softening the crust, and moderating off-flavors.\n\nA typical bagel has 260–350 calories, 1.0–4.5 grams of fat, 330–660 milligrams of sodium, and 2–5 grams of fiber. Gluten-free bagels have much more fat, often 9 grams, because of ingredients in the dough to supplant the wheat flour of the original.\n\nTraditional bagels in North America can be either Montreal-style bagel or New York-style, or East Coast Style although these styles reflect traditional methods used in Eastern Europe before bagels' importation to North America. The distinction is less rigid than other varieties.\n\nThe Montreal-style bagel contains malt and sugar with no salt; it is boiled in honey-sweetened water before baking in a wood-fired oven. It is predominantly of the sesame \"white\" seeds variety (bagels in Toronto are similar to those made in New York in that they are less sweet, generally are coated with poppy seeds and are baked in a standard oven).\n\nIn contrast to the Montreal Style Bagel, the New York bagel contains salt and malt and is boiled in water before baking in a standard oven. The resulting bagel is puffy with a moist crust. The Montreal bagel is smaller (though with a larger hole), crunchier, and sweeter. There is a local belief that New York bagels are the best due to the quality of the local water. However, this belief is heavily debated. For instance, Davidovich Bagels, made in NYC, are a recognized wholesale manufacturer of bagels that use these traditional bagel-making techniques (associated here with the Montreal-style bagel), including kettle boiling and plank baking in a wood fired oven.\n\nThe East Coast style bagel has qualities that compare to the New York-style bagel and Montreal-style bagel, while also uniquely incorporating sourdough. This sourdough mixture features a unique set of ingredients only found in Halifax, in the form of locally sourced wild yeasts. The East Coast-style bagel is not as chewy and fluffy, nor as salty as the New York-style bagel, and is less dense, doughy and sweet than a Montreal-style bagel, with an added dash of San Francisco influence.\n\nThe St. Louis style bagel refers not to composition, but to a particular method of slicing the bagel. The St. Louis style bagels are sliced vertically multiple times, instead of the traditional single horizontal slice. The slices range from 1/4 to 1/8 inches thick. This style of bagel was popularized by the St. Louis Bread Company, now known as Panera Bread. Generally, the bagels are sliced into eight pieces using a bread slicer, which produces characteristically precise cuts (e.g., the bagel is not torn or crushed while slicing). This particular method of preparation increases the surface area available for spreads (e.g., cream cheese, butter). However, it decreases the portability of the bagel and prevents formation of sandwiches.\n\nAs suggested above, other bagel styles can be found elsewhere, akin to the way in which families in a given culture employ a variety of methods when cooking an indigenous dish. Thus, Chicago-style bagels are baked or baked with steam. The traditional London bagel (or beigel as it is spelled) is harder and has a coarser texture with air bubbles.\n\nPoppy seeds are sometimes referred to by their Yiddish name, spelled either \"mun\" or \"mon\" (written מאָן), which comes from the German word for poppy, \"Mohn\", as used in \"Mohnbrötchen\". American chef John Mitzewich suggests a recipe for what he calls “San Francisco-Style Bagels”. His recipe yields bagels flatter than New York-style bagels, characterized by a rough-textured crust. An everything bagel may include such toppings as poppy seeds, sesame seeds, onion flakes, caraway seeds, garlic flakes, pretzel salt, and pepper.\n\nWhile normally and traditionally made of yeasted wheat, in the late 20th century variations on the bagel flourished. Non-traditional versions that change the dough recipe include pumpernickel, rye, sourdough, bran, whole wheat, and multigrain. Other variations change the flavor of the dough, often using blueberry, salt, onion, garlic, egg, cinnamon, raisin, chocolate chip, cheese, or some combination of the above. Green bagels are sometimes created for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nMany corporate chains now offer bagels in such flavors as chocolate chip and French toast.\n\nSandwich bagels have been popularized since the late 1990s by specialty shops such as Bruegger's and Einstein Brothers, and fast food restaurants such as McDonald's.\n\nBreakfast bagels, a softer, sweeter variety usually sold in fruity or sweet flavors (e.g., cherry, strawberry, cheese, blueberry, cinnamon-raisin, chocolate chip, maple syrup, banana and nuts) are common at large supermarket chains. These are usually sold sliced and are intended to be prepared in a toaster.\n\nA flat bagel, known as a 'flagel', can be found in a few locations in and around New York City, Long Island, and Toronto. According to a review attributed to New York's \"Village Voice\" food critic Robert Seitsema, the flagel was first created by Brooklyn's 'Tasty Bagels' deli in the early 1990s.\n\nThe New York Style Snacks brand has developed the baked snacks referred to as Bagel Crisps and Bagel Chips, which are marketed as a representation of the \"authentic taste\" of New York City bakery bagels.\n\nThough the original bagel has a fairly well-defined recipe and method of production, there is no legal standard of identity for bagels in the United States. Bakers are free to call any bread torus a bagel, even those that deviate wildly from the original formulation.\n\nAccording to the American Institute of Baking (AIB), 2008 supermarket sales (52-week period ending January 27, 2009) of the top eight leading commercial fresh (not frozen) bagel brands in the United States:\n\nFurther, AIB-provided statistics for the 52-week period ending May 18, 2008, for refrigerated/frozen supermarket bagel sales for the top 10 brand names totaled US$50,737,860, based on 36,719,977 unit package sales. Price per package was $3.02 for fresh, $1.38 for frozen.\n\nThe AIB reported US$626.9 million fresh bagel US supermarket sales (excluding Wal-Mart) for the 52 weeks ending 11 April 2012. Fresh/frozen supermarket sales (excluding Wal-Mart) for the 52 weeks ending 13 May 2012 was US$592.7 million. The average price for a bag of fresh bagels was $3.27; for frozen it was $1.23.\n\nMany cultures developed similar breads and preparations. The \"bublik\" in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the \"obwarzanek\" (in particular \"obwarzanek krakowski\") in Poland are essentially larger bagels with a wider hole. Similar to bagels, these breads are usually topped with sesame and poppy seeds. Other ring-shaped breads known among East Slavs are \"baranki\" (smaller and drier) and \"sushki\" (even smaller and drier). In Lithuania, similar breads are called \"riestainiai\", or sometimes by their Slavic name \"baronkos\".\nIn Finland, \"vesirinkeli\" are small rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread. They are placed in salted boiling water before being baked. They are often eaten for breakfast toasted and buttered. They are available in many varieties (sweet or savoury) in supermarkets.\n\nGerman \"pretzels\" (which are soft and formed into rings or long rectangular shapes) are somewhat similar to bagels in texture, the main exceptions being the shape and the alkaline water bath that makes the surface dark and glossy.\n\nIn Romania, \"covrigi\" are topped with poppy, sesame seeds or large salt grains, especially in the central area of the country. The recipe does not contain any added sweetener. They are usually shaped like pretzels rather than bagels.\n\nIn some parts of Austria, ring-shaped pastries called \"Beugel\" are sold in the weeks before Easter. Like a bagel, the yeasted wheat dough, usually flavored with caraway, is boiled before baking. However, the \"Beugel\" is crispy and can be stored for weeks. Traditionally it has to be torn apart by two individuals before eating.\n\nIn Turkey, a salty and fattier form is called \"açma\". The ring-shaped simit is sometimes marketed today as a Turkish bagel. Archival sources show that the \"simit\" has been produced in Istanbul since 1525. Based on Üsküdar court records (Şer’iyye Sicili) dated 1593, the weight and price of simit was standardized for the first time. Noted 17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi wrote that there were 70 simit bakeries in Istanbul during the 1630s\n\nJean Brindesi's early 19th-century oil paintings about Istanbul daily life show simit sellers on the streets. Warwick Goble made an illustration of the simit sellers of Istanbul in 1906. Simit is very similar to the twisted sesame-sprinkled bagels pictured being sold in early 20th century Poland. \"Simit\" are also sold on the street in baskets or carts, as bagels were then.\n\nThe Uyghurs of Xinjiang, China enjoy \"girdeh nan\" (from Persian, meaning round bread), a type of nan, the local bread.\n\n\"Bagel\" is also a Yeshivish term for sleeping 12 hours straight—e.g., \"I slept a bagel last night.\" There are various opinions as to the origins of this term. It may be a reference to the fact that bagel dough has to \"rest\" for at least 12 hours between mixing and baking or simply to the fact that the hour hand on a clock traces a bagel shape over the course of 12 hours.\n\nIn tennis, a \"bagel\" refers to a player winning a set 6–0; winning a match 6–0, 6–0, 6–0 is called a \"triple bagel\".\n\n\"\"Bublitchki\" or \"\"Bagelach\" is a title of a famous Russian and Yiddish song written in Odessa in the 1920s. The Barry Sisters together with the Ziggy Elman Orchestra made it popular in the US in 1939. Today it belongs to the repertoire of klezmer, jazz and pop musicians.\n\nIn America, February 9 is often celebrated as National Bagel Day, in which people celebrate the rich history of getting together and eating bagels.\n\n\n\n"}

It was invented in 1950 by Giuseppe Cipriani from Harry's Bar in Venice and popularised during the second half of the twentieth century. The beef was served with lemon, olive oil, and white truffle or Parmesan cheese. Later, the term was extended to dishes containing other raw meats or fish, thinly sliced and served with lemon or vinegar, olive oil, salt and ground pepper.\n\nThe dish, based on the Piedmont speciality \"carne cruda all'albese\", was invented in 1950 by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice. He originally prepared the dish for the countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo when he learned that the doctors had recommended that she eat raw meat. The dish was named \"carpaccio\" after Vittore Carpaccio, the Venetian painter known for the characteristic red and white tones of his work.\n\n"}
{"id": "214836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214836", "title": "Graham cracker", "text": "Graham cracker\n\nThe graham cracker is a sweet, cinnamon-flavored cracker made with graham flour. It originated in the early 1880s, and is a mass-produced product in contemporary times. It is eaten as a snack food, sometimes with honey, and is used as an ingredient in some foods. The name can be pronounced as or in North America.\n\nThe graham cracker was inspired by the preaching of Sylvester Graham, who was a part of and strongly influenced by the 19th-century temperance movement; Graham believed that a vegetarian diet anchored by home-made whole grain bread, made from wheat coarsely ground at home, as part of a lifestyle that involved minimizing pleasure and stimulation of all kinds, was how God intended people to live and that following this natural law would keep people healthy. His preaching was taken up widely in the US in the midst of the 1829–51 cholera pandemic. His followers, Grahamites, formed one of the first vegetarian movements in the US, and graham flour, graham crackers, and graham bread were created for them and marketed to them; Graham neither invented nor profited from these products.\n\nThe main ingredients in its earlier preparations were graham flour, oil, shortening or lard, molasses and salt. Graham crackers have been a mass-produced food product in the United States since 1898, with the National Biscuit Company being the first to mass-produce it at that time. The Loose-Wiles Biscuit Company also began mass-producing the product beginning sometime in the early 1910s. The product continues to be mass-produced in the U.S. today. In earlier times, mass-produced graham crackers were typically prepared using yeast-leavened dough, which added flavor to the food via the process of fermentation, whereas contemporary mass-production of the product typically omits this process. The dough is sometimes chilled before being rolled out, which prevents blistering and breakage from occurring when the product is baked.\n\nGraham cracker crumbs are used to create graham cracker crusts for pies and moon pie, and as a base, layer or topping for cheesecake. Graham cracker pie crusts are also mass-produced in the United States, and consumer versions of the product typically consist of a graham cracker crumb mixture pressed into an aluminum pie pan. The graham cracker is a main ingredient in the preparation of the s'more.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215722", "title": "Blood sausage", "text": "Blood sausage\n\nBlood sausages, often called blood pudding in British English (and sometimes \"black pudding\", though this normally includes oats or barley) are sausages filled with blood that are cooked or dried and mixed with a filler until they are thick enough to solidify when cooled. Variants are found worldwide. Pig, cow, sheep, duck, and goat blood can be used, varying by country.\n\nIn Europe and the Americas, typical fillers include meat, fat, suet, bread, cornmeal, onion, chestnuts, barley, and oatmeal. In Spain, Portugal, and Asia, rice is often used instead of cereals.\n\nIn many languages, there is a general term such as \"blood sausage\" (American English) and \"blood pudding\" (British English) that is used for all sausages that are made from blood, whether or not they include non-animal material such as bread, cereal, and nuts. Sausages that include such material are often in addition referred to with more specific terms, for example, \"black pudding\" in English.\n\nIn Kenya \"Mutura\" is a traditional dish among the people of central Kenya, although today popular among all. It is made with meat, blood, spices all encased in the animal's intestines or stomach. In Kenya fillers include fresh minced goat or beef, fat, and red onions.\n\nThe slaughtered goat, cow or sheep has its blood collected to use in the stuffing, though today many types of mutura, especially commercial ones sold on the streets do not contain blood. The meat for the filling can be any fleshy part, but like any other sausage, the prime cuts are not ordinarily used for the stuffing. Instead the tougher, leaner cuts for example the neck are trimmed off the bone. The casing for the stuffing is the stomach sack and larger intestines. These are flushed many times with water to clean them.\n\nThe meat for the stuffing is finely chopped or minced, and the mandatory fat is often trimmed from other parts. The meat is slightly fried, mixed with finely chopped red onions, salt and optionally fresh chili. Other additions include freshly chopped coriander (dhania or cilantro), garlic, pepper and even beef stock. This is then mixed thoroughly with the fresh blood from the animal, and stuffed into the stomach and intestines, with the openings sewn or tied together with string.\n\nThe sausage is boiled in large pot (often with other parts of the animal not roasted and used to make soup) for 30 – 45 minutes, and roasted over coals till brown. Sliced, it is served with kachumbari, an onion based salad consisting of tomatoes, red onions and fresh coriander, a bit of chili and squeeze of lemon. The accompanying starch is ugali.\n\nBlood sausages are very difficult to find in US supermarkets. Brussels and Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin are both home to local grocers who produce blood sausage, due to their large Belgian American populations. Supermarkets throughout Maine also carry locally produced blood pudding due to the state's large French Canadian population. In southeastern Michigan, Polish-style \"Kaszanka\" can be found in supermarkets throughout the year and is very popular.\n\nAn Italian-American version of blood sausage in the San Francisco Bay Area is called \"biroldo\" and has pine nuts, raisins, spices, pig snouts and is made using either pig's or cow's blood. German-style blood sausage and Zungenwurst can be found in Fresno and Santa Rosa, where Russian and Armenian delis offer a wide range of Central European foods. Also, Alpine Village in Torrance, California has Blutwurst due to a considerable German-American population in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County.\n\nCajun \"boudin\" is a fresh sausage made with green onions, pork, pork liver (making it somewhat gritty/grainy), and rice. Pig's blood was sometimes added to produce \"boudin rouge\", but this tradition became increasingly rare after the mid-twentieth century due to the decline of the \"boucherie\" (traditional communal butchering) and government health regulations prohibiting the transportation of raw blood. As a result, Cajun \"boudin\" is now usually made without blood; however, blood or \"black\" \"boudin\" can still be purchased.\n\n In many areas of Latin America, \"morcilla\" is served. \"Morcilla\" is sometimes made with a filler of rice and/or onions, and seasoned with paprika and other spices. In Puerto Rico, it is served fried and mostly consumed during the holidays. In Colombia, \"morcilla\" can have rice, green peas, cilantro or culantro, and is often eaten as an appetizer called \"picada\" or with the traditional dishes \"Bandeja Paisa\" or \"Fritanga\". In Venezuela, \"morcilla\" is often served with \"parrilla\" (barbecue). \n\n\"Morcilla\" is also eaten inside a sandwich called \"morcipán\", especially in the Río de la Plata. In Argentina, \"morcilla\" is a component of the \"asado\", a regional mixed grill or barbecue meal. In Uruguay, a sweet version including raisins and pine nuts is popular, some vendors even add chocolate, caramelised orange peels, peanuts, and other dried fruits. Uruguayans usually are fond of sweet or salty \"morcilla\", and most restaurants and supermarkets carry both versions.\n\nIn Ecuador the blood sausage is also called \"morcilla\", while in Panama and Colombia, it is called \"morcilla\", \"rellena\" or \"tubería negra\", and is usually filled with rice. In Brazil, as in Portugal, \"morcela\" and \"chouriço de sangue\" are eaten. In El Salvador, Nicaragua and Mexico, it is called \"moronga\".\n\nIn Brazil there is a version of the blood sausage called \"chouriço\" or \"morcela\" (sometimes the Castillian Spanish version \"morcilla\" is used as well), consisting of a fresh sausage made of the blood and fat from pork and usually rice. It is a variation of the Portuguese blood sausage, and it is known for its deep dark color. In some regions, it is popular on barbecues (\"Churrascos\") as a starter.\n\nIn Antigua, rice pudding is a local delicacy and it is prepared the same way as blood sausage.\n\nIn Barbados, blood sausage is made with sweet potato (\"batata\"), pig's blood and onions, seasoned with peppers and other herbs and stuffed in pig intestines. It is normally served with \"souse\", which is pickled pig's feet, pig's ears and other trimmings. The cooked meat is cut into bite-sized pieces and soaked in a brine made of water, lime juice, cucumbers, hot pepper, and specially prepared seasonings. Blood sausage and souse is a Bajan delicacy usually prepared on weekends and special occasions.\n\nIn the French Antilles, \"boudin créole\" is very popular, this being the French \"boudin noir\" with local Caribbean chilli and other spices.\n\nIn Guyana, blood sausage is a very popular snack served at social occasions, and as \"cutters\" when drinking. The main ingredient is cooked rice seasoned with herbs, such as thyme and basil. The rice is mixed with cow's blood, stuffed into cow's or pig's intestine, and boiled until firm, sliced and served with Sour (a mild type of dipping sauce with hot peppers). White pudding is also made.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, blood sausage is known as morcilla. Puerto Rican blood sausage is made with rice, culantro, cilantro, garlic, and Cubanelle pepper. Some contain paprika and annatto. Morcilla is especially popular during Christmas.\n\nIn Suriname, blood sausage is known by the Dutch name \"bloedworst\", and white pudding by the also Dutch name \"vleesworst\".\n\nIn Trinidad & Tobago, the local style of blood sausage is heavily seasoned with local peppers and traditionally prepared from pig's blood, often substituted by pig's liver today. It is sold by local producers as a popular accompaniment to rolls of crusty hops bread or served as an accompaniment to \"trotter souse\", a stew based on trotters.\n\nOther varieties of blood sausage include \"boudin rouge\" (Creole and Cajun), \"rellena\" or \"moronga\" (Mexico) and \"sanganel\" (Friuli).\n\nIn Chile, the blood sausage is called \"prieta\" (a synonym of \"negra\", black) and tends to have a very thick skin, so is eaten cut open lengthwise. Apart from blood and a little fat, \"prietas\" may contain a variety of ingredients, such as chopped onion and spices, cabbage, peppers, watercress, rice, meat or even dried fruit or nuts. \"Prietas\" or \"morcillas\" are part of the Chilote tradition of \"\"reitimiento\"\" involving the slaughter and preparation of a pig.\n\nPrietas are easily found at supermarkets throughout the country and are available from practically any butcher.\n\nIn The Yucatán Peninsula, morcilla is made exclusively from pig's blood and once deep fried it's served with a mix of pickled onions, cilantro and spices. It's always consumed in the form of Tacos and paired with fresh Habanero Peppers.\n\nIn Central Mexico, morcilla is known as Moronga.\n\nAcross Asia, various people create food from congealed animal blood. Most of these food types do not have casing and might be considered a version of sliced sausage.\n\nBlood sausage is popular in Mongolia. In Mongolia a special method of killing sheep was made mandatory by Genghis Khan to save blood for sausage. It appears in the Yasa and is still used today.\n\nIn Tibetan cuisine, sausages or \"gyurma\" refer to blood sausages and are made with yak or sheep's blood which may or may not include either rice or roasted barley flour as filler. The sausage uses natural casing employing the use of yak or sheep's intestine.\n\nIn the Chinese cuisines, whole coagulated blood is fried or steamed as a snack or cooked in a hot pot. In mainland China, \"blood tofu\" (), or \"red tofu\" (), is most often made with pig's or duck's blood, although chicken's or cow's blood may also be used. Like the above dishes, this has no casing but is simply cut into rectangular pieces and cooked. In the Northeast China, the \"blood sausage\" is a traditional food which is cooked with sheep or goat blood. In resource-poor Tibet, congealed yak's blood is a traditional food. Chinese people also used Pig blood curd make pig blood soup that was consumed by laborers in Kaifeng over 1,000 years ago. in the south of China. The Chinese mostly eat rice and sometimes into different styles of rice dishes. They added rice to the duck blood and steamed it. called blood rice cake (Chinese:米血糕 pinyin:mǐ xuě gāo;).and because it used duck blood，often called duck blood rice cake (Chinese:鴨血糕; pinyin: yā xuě gāo;). However, the price of duck meat was once very high and its blood was unable to be supplied. Therefore, duck blood is now replaced by pig blood.\n\nIn Taiwan, \"pig's blood cake\" () or \"rice blood cake\"(), made of pork blood and sticky rice is served on a popsicle stick is a very popular snack at local night markets in Taiwan.\n\nThe majority of Korea's \"sundae\" (순대) can be categorised as blood sausage. The most common type of \"Sundae\" is made of sweet potato noodle (\"dangmyeon\"), barley, and pig's blood but some variants contain sesame leaves, green onion, fermented soy paste (\"doenjang\"), sweet rice, kimchi, bean sprouts, in addition to the common ingredients. The Korean Sundae is wrapped with pig's intestines. The addition of sweet potato noodle is a more modern addition to the dish.\nThere is another Korean food called Seonji which is cow blood that has been boiled in soup. It looks like the Blodpudding of Sweden.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the dish closest to Blood sausage is Pig blood curd, which is only made from pig's blood and is not considered a sausage.\n\nThis dish is known in Java as \"saren\", which is made with chicken's blood.\n\nIn Penang or other northern states, pig blood curd (known locally in Penang Hokkien as \"too huet\"; ) is usually served with the local street delicacy Curry Mee (curry noodles). It can also be mixed with some traditional Hokkien dishes as well.\n\nBlood sausage is known generically as \"longganisang dugo\" (lit. \"blood longaniza\") in the Philippines. A notable type of native blood sausage is \"pinuneg\", which is composed of minced pork and innards in a pork casing made from large intestines that is prepared in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines.\n\nIn Thai cuisine \"sai krok lueat\" (Thai: ไส้กรอกเลือด) is a blood sausage ( = sausage, = blood), often served sliced and accompanied by a spicy dipping sauce. \"Blood tofu\" is simply called \"lueat\" (, blood) in Thailand. This can be used in many Thai dishes such as in noodle soups, Thai curries, or as an addition to certain rice dishes such as Khao man kai.\n\nVietnamese 'dồi tiết' (Northern) or 'dồi huyết' (Southern) is blood sausage, boiled or fried, made with pork blood, pork fat and basil.\n\nIn Limbu cuisine, sargemba or sargyangma is a type of blood sausage made mostly from pork intestines, pork fat, rice and yangben, a type of edible wild lichen.\n\nThroughout Central and Eastern Europe, blood sausage, known as \"kishka\" (meaning \"intestine\"), is made with pig's blood and buckwheat kasha. It is also known in Russia as \"krovyanka\" (кровянка), or \"krovyanaya kolbasa\" (кровяная колбаса, literally \"blood sausage\"), and include buckwheat as a main filler, instead of oats or oatmeal. In Ukraine it's called \"krov'yanka\" (кров'янка) or \"kryvava kyshka\" (кривава кишка), \"kiszka\" or \"kaszanka\" in Poland, \"krvavnička\" in Slovakia and \"krupniok\" in Silesia. Polish \"salceson\" (\"black\" and \"\") are a type of head cheese (\"brawn\") that contains blood. In Hungary, \"véres hurka\" is made with rice, pig's blood and pork. In Bulgaria, \"karvavitsa\" (кървавица) is usually prepared with pig's blood, fat and a variety of mountain herbs and spices and eaten warm during the winter. A similar blood sausage, called \"krvavica\" (крвавица), made out of similar ingredients, is also eaten in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia during winter time, usually with sauerkraut and cooked potatoes.\n\nIn Romania, the traditional \"sângerete\" (from \"sânge\", \"blood\" in Romanian) is made from shoulder butt pork meat, pork blood and a filler such as pre-boiled rice seasoned with pepper, garlic and basil. It has many regional variants, but the most common are the \"sângerete\" from Transylvania.\n\nSimilarly, in Czech cuisine, \"jelito\" is made from second-rate pork, pig's blood and peeled barley; the stuffing served by itself, unformed, is called \"prejt\".\n\nIn Denmark, \"blodpølse\" is made from pigs's blood and suet, rye flour, brown sugar, raisins, salt, cinnamon and cardamom stuffed into natural or artificial intestines. It is usually boiled in its skin, eaten hot or cold, sometimes sliced and fried, served with syrup, cinnamon and stewed apples.\n\nIn Estonia, \"verivorst\" (blood sausage) is very similar to Finnish \"mustamakkara\". It is sold and eaten mostly in winter, being a traditional Christmas food. At that time there is a large variety of \"verivorst\" in stores, ranging in different shapes and sizes. \"Verivorst\" is usually cooked in an oven, but sometimes also fried in a pan. \"Verivorst\" is often eaten together with lingonberry jam, but occasionally also with butter or sour cream. Another similar dish is called \"verikäkk\" (blood dumpling). Its popularity has decreased during the past decades (possibly because of its less appealing commercial appearance) and has mostly been substituted by \"verivorst\".\n\nAlongside the \"mustamakkara\" (black sausage) in Finland, a dish similar to the British black pudding is made by making batter out of pig's blood and baking it like pancakes. Traditionally, rye flour or oatmeal is used and minced onion is added to the mix. This dish is called \"veriohukainen\" or \"verilettu\" (blood pancake). \"Rössypottu\" is a traditional soup in northern Finland with blood pudding as a main ingredient.\n\nIn Iceland, \"blóðmör\" is one of two types of \"slátur\". It is made from lamb's blood and suet, rye flour and oats, traditionally stuffed into pouches sewn from the lamb's stomach. It is usually boiled in its skin, eaten hot or cold, sometimes sliced and fried. After cooking, it is often preserved in fermented whey and acquires a distinct sour taste.\n\n\"Blodpudding\" is a traditional medieval dish still popular in Sweden. The exact proportions and ingredients vary, partly according to regional preference, but generally it is made from pig's blood, milk, rye or barley flour, diced lard, either beer or svagdricka, treacle and onion, flavoured with allspice and marjoram. It is then poured into forms and oven-baked in a waterbath. Most of the \"blodpudding\" consumed today is made on industrial basis.\n\nWhen prepared for serving, it is sliced and fried. The style of serving and accompaniments vary across the country, and it is not uncommon to have the \"blodpudding\" act as the meat in a meal. Nationally, the common way is to serve it with lingonberry jam, grated carrots and ice cold milk to drink. Fried bacon or porkside is also common. In Scania, the lingonberry jam is often replaced by finely sliced apples, fried along with the pork.\n\nOther blood-based foods include \"blodkorv\" (blood sausage) which differs from \"blodpudding\" by having raisins, pork tallow and apple sauce in it, \"blodplättar\" (blood pancakes, similar to the original Finnish dish \"veriohukainen\" above) and \"blodpalt\". There is also a soup made from blood, called \"svartsoppa\" (black soup).\n\nIn Italy, regional varieties of blood sausage are known as 'sanguinaccio'. In Tuscany, is a sausage made with pig's blood and fat cooked in a pig's stomach. It is not reheated and is often spread on bread. It is found only in the south of Tuscany in the winter months and even there it can be difficult to come by. Biroldo is another type of black pudding which can be found in Tuscany, while the version made in southern Lombardy is called Marsapan.\n\nMigliaccio is a black pudding that was traditionally prepared in winter in Romagna. It is a sweet pudding with a thick black filling made with pig's blood, sugar, breadcrumbs, almonds, chocolate, butter and spices contained in a thin pastry crust. A similar pudding is made throughout southern Italy, generally called Sanguinaccio.\n\nIn Portuguese cuisine, there are many varieties of blood sausage. Sausages made of blood are usually called \"morcela\" or \"negrinha\" (a slang term from Portuguese \"negro\" meaning dark or black). There are many varieties around the Portuguese world. There are varieties local to Portugal, the Azores, Hawaii, China, US and India, etc.\n\nSpanish \"morcilla\" has many variants. The most well-known and widespread is \"morcilla de Burgos\" which contains mainly pork blood and fat, rice, onions, and salt, and is produced in two varieties: cylindrical and gut-shaped. In Albacete and La Mancha, the \"morcilla\" is filled with onions instead of rice, which completely changes the texture. In Extremadura the creamy \"morcilla patatera\" includes roughly mashed potatoes. In the northern regions and the Canary Islands there is a sweet variety known as \"morcilla dulce\". Other varieties introduce breadcrumbs, pine nuts, and almonds, and vary the proportions of the other ingredients or flavourings, some of them considered delicacies.\n\nThere are other similarly famous kinds being made at Asturias (slightly darker and smaller, used for bean and chickpea stews) and León (no-rice grilled & spread on toasted bread). Other less popular varieties may add cumin to the pudding mixture, but this is not a standard practice. The cooking method for consumption is typically done fried, stewed, grilled or roasted, and usually sliced in one-finger-thick wheelettes (\"rodajas\"). There are many derivative foods made from morcilla, such as omelettes, stuffed red pepper, puff pastry, pizza, flavoured nachos, croquettes, and a range of fillings for different dishes.\n\nIn Belgium and the Netherlands, \"bloedworst\" or \"beuling\" is sold either in slices, or individual sausages the size of a banana. It is generally pan fried; sometimes apples are cooked alongside or on top of the pieces. It is also eaten with apple sauce, brown sugar, syrup or red cabbage. As a cold cut, thin slices are eaten as a sandwich topping. Green cabbage is one of the ingredients in Luxembourg's träipen which are also served pan fried with apple sauce. It is known to have been eaten in church in the Middle Ages during Carnival in the Netherlands.\n\nIn France, \"boudin noir\" is traditionally prepared in \"charcuteries\", shops that prepare mainly pork products (and sometimes duck and game), but also sell smoked and dried sausages, pâtés, and terrines, along with prepared salads. It is usually called \"boudin noir\" and is often made with cream with apples or onions as a filler. It is generally served with either cooked apples, mashed potatoes or both, and is appreciated by combining either the apples or mashed potatoes with each bite of \"boudin\", which has been gently heated and browned in butter. In France also, there are many different regional \"Boudins Noirs\" such as the large \"Boudin du Béarn\" with pork meat pieces eaten usually cold. The French \"Confrérie des Chevaliers du Goûte-Boudin\" (Brotherhood of the Knights of Blood Sausage Tasting) in Mortagne-au-Perche in southern Normandy holds an annual contest of international blood sausage specialities. Boudin is considered the emblematic staple of the French Foreign Legion, and gives its name to the Legion's anthem.\n\nThe most common variant of German \"Blutwurst\" is made from pork rind, pork blood and regionally different fillers such as barley. Though already cooked and \"ready to eat\" it is sometimes served warm, similar to the usage in France. In the Rhineland, where it is also traditionally made from horse meat, fried \"Blutwurst\" is a constituent of various dishes. In particular in Cologne, the traditional \"Himmel und Erde\" (Heaven and Earth) combines apple sauce, mashed potatoes and \"Blutwurst\" served hot on one plate. In Berlin, hot \"Blutwurst\" mixed together with liverwurst and potatoes is called \"\"\"\" (\"Dead Grandma\").\n\nOther German variants are \"Zungenwurst\", which is \"Blutwurst\" mixed with pieces of pickled ox tongue, and \"Beutelwurst\" which is pressed in a linen or paper bag (\"Beutel\"). A variety of \"Blutwurst\", the \"Rotwurst\" from Thuringia (\"Thüringer Rotwurst\") has geographical indication protection under EU law, with PGI status. \"Kartoffelwurst\" (potato sausage) is a post-World War II variety popular in the Palatinate, a reduced fat version of \"Blutwurst\" using potato cubes instead of bacon.\n\nIn Austria it is often prepared in a dish known as \"Blunzngröstl\", which consists of pan-fried potatoes and blood sausage. This is usually served with freshly grated horseradish.\n\nBlack pudding is the native British version of blood sausage. It is generally made from pork blood and a relatively high proportion of oatmeal. In the past it was occasionally flavoured with pennyroyal, differing from continental European versions in its relatively limited range of ingredients and reliance on oatmeal and barley instead of onions to absorb the blood. It can be eaten cold, as it is cooked in production, grilled, fried or boiled in its skin. It is often served sliced and fried or grilled as part of a traditional full breakfast, a tradition that followed British and Irish emigrants around the world. Black pudding is now part of the local cuisine of New Zealand and the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nStornoway Black Pudding produced on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, is one of the most renowned varieties and has been granted Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin (PGI) status.\n\nThe similar white pudding is a further important feature of the traditional Northumbrian, Scottish, Irish and Newfoundland breakfast. Black and white pudding, as well as a third variant, red pudding, is served battered in some chip shops in England, Scotland and Ireland as an alternative to fish and chips.\n\nWhile \"blood sausage\" in English is understood in Britain, the term is applied only to foreign usage (e.g., in the story \"The Name-Day\" by Saki), or to similar blood-based sausages elsewhere in the world.\n\nOther varieties of blood sausage include \"blodpølse\" (Norway and Denmark), \"tongenworst\" (with added pigs tongues) (Netherlands), \"mazzit\" (Malta), \"krvavica\" (Balkans), \"krovianka\" (Russia and Ukraine), \"vėdarai\" (Lithuania), \"asins desa\" (Latvia).\n\n"}

{"id": "216082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216082", "title": "Climbing harness", "text": "Climbing harness\n\nA climbing harness is an item of climbing equipment for rock-climbing, abseiling, or other activities requiring the use of ropes to provide access or safety such as industrial rope access, working at heights, etc. A harness secures a person to a rope or an anchor point.\n\nIn its simplest form, a harness can be made from a length of rope or a nylon webbing tied round the waist. However this is extremely uncomfortable unless the wearer is very light. It can also ride up to the abdomen or even the diaphragm under load and cause serious injury. Looping the rope between the legs will prevent this, though care should be taken to avoid sensitive areas. More sophisticated harnesses exist in many patterns, designed to give greater comfort and security, and more options for carrying equipment.\n\nWhile harnesses can be improvised, it is more common to use commercially produced harnesses, which often include padding and amenities such as gear loops. Most commercial climbing harnesses meet the guidelines and manufacturing standards of organizations such as the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UiAA) or European Committee for Standardization.\n\nHarnesses should be attached to dynamic (stretchy) rope, except possibly when abseiling where the rope is always taut. Falling onto a system consisting entirely of static components e.g. slings over even a very short distance e.g. a metre or two is enough to deliver large forces to the body and possibly cause the equipment to fail altogether. For via ferrata, the harness is attached to lines via a shock absorber that can absorb some of the impact in the event of a fall.\n\nAttachment of the rope to the harness is done using a knot called a figure-eight follow through, and often backed up with a stopper knot. Other knots are possible for the purpose, primarily a variation of the double bowline, but the figure-eight is usually preferred. Although it is harder to untie after a fall, it is inherently more secure, easier to tie, and easier to verify that it has been tied correctly. There are many variations of the bowline knot, and some will untie themselves when repeatedly stressed and unstressed, as is common in climbing.\n\nIn addition to the weight bearing parts of the harness, there are parts of the harness that are not designed to be part of the safety system. These include the gear loops, used for carrying equipment e.g. protection devices, carabiners, etc., and the elastic cords which pass behind the buttocks for the purpose of keeping the leg loops from slipping down while not under load. Any attempt to tie the safety system into these components could lead to failure and an unprotected fall. It is acceptable to attach the rope to a leg loop via a Prusik knot and carabiner, but this should only be done with the brake end of the rope in an abseil system in order to keep the Prusik clear of the belay plate. This end of the rope experiences considerably lower forces than the \"live\" end, due to the action of the belay device.\n\nThe invention of the climbing harness has been attributed to Jeanne Immink, a Dutch climber in the late nineteenth century. Some of the first climbing harnesses were devised in the U.K. in the early 1960s by Alan Waterhouse, Paul Seddon and Tony Howard who went on to form the Troll climbing equipment manufacturers. A harness designed by British climber Don Whillans was made by Troll for the 1970 Annapurna South Face Expedition. It went into mass production shortly afterwards and soon became popular worldwide.\n\nThe sit or seat harness was invented in the 1960s by Yosemite climbers. The first innovation was the Swami Belt, which was multiple loops of webbing around the waist. Then quickly came the Swami Seat, a sit harness tied from webbing, including leg loops and an integrated waist loop. Once the seat/sit harness came to be, suppliers of climbing gear started making them with stitching replacing the knots. The Swami Seat was revealed to the climbing world thru an article in Summit Magazine in the mid-60s. Sewn harnesses came later.\n\nA sit harness consists of a waist belt and two leg loops which are normally connected in the front of the hips through a permanent webbing loop called a \"belay loop\". Belay loops are extremely strong, but nonetheless still a single point of failure that caused at least one notorious death. For rock climbing, the rope typically goes through the two \"tie-in loops\" that are above and below the \"belay loop\". The figure-eight knot is mostly used for rock climbing. These are the most commonly used harnesses for recreational activities such as abseiling and rock climbing, as they afford a wide range of movement while still maintaining a high level of safety. Ensuring the harness fits correctly is key to avoiding pain in the upper thigh area caused by the leg loops being too tight around the upper legs and groin area, while at the same time ensuring that a climber flipped over in a fall does not slip out. The waist belt should be tightened snugly. Leg loops should not be particularly tight, but for obvious reasons neither should they have enough slack to allow extraneous parts of a male climber to get caught inside them.\n\nA chest harness is worn around the shoulders, usually with a sit harness so as to provide an additional attachment point. This attachment point allows for better balance in some situations such as when carrying a heavy pack (as the centre of mass is below the connection to the rope) and when the person in the harness may be unable to maintain an upright position (due to injury or other influences).\n\nA full-body harness is the combination of a sit harness and a chest harness which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of harness normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of a sit harness which is easier to slip out of.\n\nIn a study conducted, researchers came to a conclusion that there was no statistically significant evidence revealing a pattern between harness type and severity of climbing accidents. Direct rock contact in rock climbing was the main reason for injury, not the type of climbing harness used.\n\nMost harnesses are generally made from webbing. This webbing is often nylon webbing as polyester webbing doesn't hold triglides and d-rings as well, and it's easier to untie nylon webbing. Specifically, Nylon 66 is the most common type of nylon used for this webbing. The webbing is often also tubular webbing, instead of flat webbing. Within a single harness, there are many different weaves of nylon based on the intended function of the specific part of the harness. These weaves sometimes include polyester. The buckles are typically made of anodized aluminum. For the leg loops and waist belt, companies use various methods to make the harness comfortable. The most common method is cushioning the harness with foam and mesh. However, for more lightweight harnesses, some companies use wider waist belts and unidirectional fibers going along the waist belt to distribute the weight evenly and minimize pressure points. Harness designers use increasingly advanced materials such as Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), aramid fibers (Kevlar, Vectran, etc.), and sailcloth (e.g. the Black Diamond Vision harness) in order to make harnesses lighter and more comfortable. Different harnesses use different materials for these fibers across the leg loops and waist belt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216102", "title": "Genetically modified food", "text": "Genetically modified food\n\nGenetically modified foods (GM foods), also known as genetically engineered foods (GE foods), or bioengineered foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering. Genetic engineering techniques allow for the introduction of new traits as well as greater control over traits when compared to previous methods, such as selective breeding and mutation breeding.\n\nCommercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its unsuccessful Flavr Savr delayed-ripening tomato. Most food modifications have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and cotton. Genetically modified crops have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and for better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have been developed, although, , none were on the market.\n\nThere is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.\n\nHowever, there are ongoing public concerns related to food safety, regulation, labelling, environmental impact, research methods, and the fact that some GM seeds, along with all new plant varieties, are subject to plant breeders' rights owned by corporations.\n\nGenetically modified foods are foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering as opposed to traditional cross breeding. In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) favor the use of the term \"genetic engineering\" over \"genetic modification\" as being more precise; the USDA defines \"genetic modification\" to include \"genetic engineering or other more traditional methods\".\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, \"genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called 'modern biotechnology' or 'gene technology', sometimes also 'recombinant DNA technology' or 'genetic engineering'. ... Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods.\"\n\nHuman-directed genetic manipulation of food began with the domestication of plants and animals through artificial selection at about 10,500 to 10,100 BC. The process of selective breeding, in which organisms with desired traits (and thus with the desired genes) are used to breed the next generation and organisms lacking the trait are not bred, is a precursor to the modern concept of genetic modification (GM). With the discovery of DNA in the early 1900s and various advancements in genetic techniques through the 1970s it became possible to directly alter the DNA and genes within food.\n\nThe first genetically modified plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. Genetically modified microbial enzymes were the first application of genetically modified organisms in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant chymosin was approved for use in several countries. Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows' stomach lining. Scientists modified bacteria to produce chymosin, which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.\n\nThe first genetically modified food approved for release was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. Developed by Calgene, it was engineered to have a longer shelf life by inserting an antisense gene that delayed ripening. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in 1993 with the introduction of virus-resistant tobacco. In 1995, \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt) Potato was approved for cultivation, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the US. Other genetically modified crops receiving marketing approval in 1995 were: canola with modified oil composition, Bt maize, cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, Bt cotton, glyphosate-tolerant soybeans, virus-resistant squash, and another delayed ripening tomato.\n\nWith the creation of golden rice in 2000, scientists had genetically modified food to increase its nutrient value for the first time.\n\nBy 2010, 29 countries had planted commercialized biotech crops and a further 31 countries had granted regulatory approval for transgenic crops to be imported. The US was the leading country in the production of GM foods in 2011, with twenty-five GM crops having received regulatory approval. In 2015, 92% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 94% of cotton produced in the US were genetically modified strains.\n\nThe first genetically modified animal to be approved for food use was AquAdvantage salmon in 2015. The salmon were transformed with a growth hormone-regulating gene from a Pacific Chinook salmon and a promoter from an ocean pout enabling it to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer.\n\nIn April 2016, a white button mushroom (\"Agaricus bisporus\") modified using the CRISPR technique received \"de facto\" approval in the United States, after the USDA said it would not have to go through the agency's regulatory process. The agency considers the mushroom exempt because the editing process did not involve the introduction of foreign DNA.\n\nThe most widely planted GMOs are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. Palmer amaranth is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.\n\nGenetically engineered organisms are generated and tested in the laboratory for desired qualities. The most common modification is to add one or more genes to an organism's genome. Less commonly, genes are removed or their expression is increased or silenced or the number of copies of a gene is increased or decreased.\n\nOnce satisfactory strains are produced, the producer applies for regulatory approval to field-test them, called a \"field release\". Field-testing involves cultivating the plants on farm fields or growing animals in a controlled environment. If these field tests are successful, the producer applies for regulatory approval to grow and market the crop. Once approved, specimens (seeds, cuttings, breeding pairs, etc.) are cultivated and sold to farmers. The farmers cultivate and market the new strain. In some cases, the approval covers marketing but not cultivation.\n\nAccording to the USDA, the number of field releases for genetically engineered organisms has grown from four in 1985 to an average of about 800 per year. Cumulatively, more than 17,000 releases had been approved through September 2013.\n\nPapaya was genetically modified to resist the ringspot virus (PSRV). \"SunUp\" is a transgenic red-fleshed Sunset papaya cultivar that is homozygous for the coat protein gene PRSV; \"Rainbow\" is a yellow-fleshed F1 hybrid developed by crossing 'SunUp' and nontransgenic yellow-fleshed \"Kapoho\". \"The New York Times\" stated, \"in the early 1990s, Hawaii's papaya industry was facing disaster because of the deadly papaya ringspot virus. Its single-handed savior was a breed engineered to be resistant to the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. Today, 80% of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered, and there is still no conventional or organic method to control ringspot virus.\" The GM cultivar was approved in 1998. In China, a transgenic PRSV-resistant papaya was developed by South China Agricultural University and was first approved for commercial planting in 2006; as of 2012 95% of the papaya grown in Guangdong province and 40% of the papaya grown in Hainan province was genetically modified. In Hong Kong, where there is an exemption on growing and releasing any varieties of GM papaya, more than 80% of grown and imported papayas were transgenic.\n\nThe New Leaf potato, a GM food developed using naturally occurring bacteria found in the soil known as \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt), was made to provide in-plant protection from the yield-robbing Colorado potato beetle. The New Leaf potato, brought to market by Monsanto in the late 1990s, was developed for the fast food market. It was withdrawn in 2001 after retailers rejected it and food processors ran into export problems.\n\nAs of 2005, about 13% of the Zucchini (a form of squash) grown in the US was genetically modified to resist three viruses; that strain is also grown in Canada.\n\nIn 2011, BASF requested the European Food Safety Authority's approval for cultivation and marketing of its Fortuna potato as feed and food. The potato was made resistant to late blight by adding resistant genes blb1 and blb2 that originate from the Mexican wild potato Solanum bulbocastanum. In February 2013, BASF withdrew its application.\n\nIn 2013, the USDA approved the import of a GM pineapple that is pink in color and that \"overexpresses\" a gene derived from tangerines and suppress other genes, increasing production of lycopene. The plant's flowering cycle was changed to provide for more uniform growth and quality. The fruit \"does not have the ability to propagate and persist in the environment once they have been harvested\", according to USDA APHIS. According to Del Monte's submission, the pineapples are commercially grown in a \"monoculture\" that prevents seed production, as the plant's flowers aren't exposed to compatible pollen sources. Importation into Hawaii is banned for \"plant sanitation\" reasons.\n\nIn 2014, the USDA approved a genetically modified potato developed by J. R. Simplot Company that contained ten genetic modifications that prevent bruising and produce less acrylamide when fried. The modifications eliminate specific proteins from the potatoes, via RNA interference, rather than introducing novel proteins.\n\nIn February 2015 Arctic Apples were approved by the USDA, becoming the first genetically modified apple approved for sale in the US. Gene silencing is used to reduce the expression of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), thus preventing the fruit from browning.\n\nCorn used for food and ethanol has been genetically modified to tolerate various herbicides and to express a protein from \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt) that kills certain insects. About 90% of the corn grown in the US was genetically modified in 2010. In the US in 2015, 81% of corn acreage contained the Bt trait and 89% of corn acreage contained the glyphosate-tolerant trait. Corn can be processed into grits, meal and flour as an ingredient in pancakes, muffins, doughnuts, breadings and batters, as well as baby foods, meat products, cereals and some fermented products. Corn-based masa flour and masa dough are used in the production of taco shells, corn chips and tortillas.\n\nGenetically modified soybean has been modified to tolerate herbicides and produce healthier oils. In 2015, 94% of soybean acreage in the U.S. was genetically modified to be glyphosate-tolerant.\n\nAs of December 2017, genetically modified wheat has been evaluated in field trials, but has not been released commercially.\n\nStarch or amylum is a polysaccharide produced by all green plants as an energy store. Pure starch is a white, tasteless and odourless powder. It consists of two types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin. Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to 80% amylopectin by weight.\n\nStarch can be further modified to create modified starch for specific purposes, including creation of many of the sugars in processed foods. They include:\n\nLecithin is a naturally occurring lipid. It can be found in egg yolks and oil-producing plants. It is an emulsifier and thus is used in many foods. Corn, soy and safflower oil are sources of lecithin, though the majority of lecithin commercially available is derived from soy. Sufficiently processed lecithin is often undetectable with standard testing practices. According to the FDA, no evidence shows or suggests hazard to the public when lecithin is used at common levels. Lecithin added to foods amounts to only 2 to 10 percent of the 1 to 5 g of phosphoglycerides consumed daily on average. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about GM food extend to such products. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in Europe in 2000, when Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because of the difficulty of detecting the origin of derivatives like lecithin with current testing practices, European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to employ a comprehensive system of Identity preservation (IP).\n\nThe US imports 10% of its sugar, while the remaining 90% is extracted from sugar beet and sugarcane. After deregulation in 2005, glyphosate-resistant sugar beet was extensively adopted in the United States. 95% of beet acres in the US were planted with glyphosate-resistant seed in 2011. GM sugar beets are approved for cultivation in the US, Canada and Japan; the vast majority are grown in the US. GM beets are approved for import and consumption in Australia, Canada, Colombia, EU, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, the Russian Federation and Singapore. Pulp from the refining process is used as animal feed. The sugar produced from GM sugar beets contains no DNA or protein – it is just sucrose that is chemically indistinguishable from sugar produced from non-GM sugar beets. Independent analyses conducted by internationally recognized laboratories found that sugar from Roundup Ready sugar beets is identical to the sugar from comparably grown conventional (non-Roundup Ready) sugar beets.\n\nMost vegetable oil used in the US is produced from GM crops canola, corn, cotton and soybeans. Vegetable oil is sold directly to consumers as cooking oil, shortening and margarine and is used in prepared foods. There is a vanishingly small amount of protein or DNA from the original crop in vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is made of triglycerides extracted from plants or seeds and then refined and may be further processed via hydrogenation to turn liquid oils into solids. The refining process removes all, or nearly all non-triglyceride ingredients. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) offer an alternative to conventional fats and oils. The length of a fatty acid influences its fat absorption during the digestive process. Fatty acids in the middle position on the glycerol molecules appear to be absorbed more easily and influence metabolism more than fatty acids on the end positions. Unlike ordinary fats, MCTs are metabolized like carbohydrates. They have exceptional oxidative stability, and prevent foods from turning rancid readily.\n\nLivestock and poultry are raised on animal feed, much of which is composed of the leftovers from processing crops, including GM crops. For example, approximately 43% of a canola seed is oil. What remains after oil extraction is a meal that becomes an ingredient in animal feed and contains canola protein. Likewise, the bulk of the soybean crop is grown for oil and meal. The high-protein defatted and toasted soy meal becomes livestock feed and dog food. 98% of the US soybean crop goes for livestock feed. In 2011, 49% of the US maize harvest was used for livestock feed (including the percentage of waste from distillers grains). \"Despite methods that are becoming more and more sensitive, tests have not yet been able to establish a difference in the meat, milk, or eggs of animals depending on the type of feed they are fed. It is impossible to tell if an animal was fed GM soy just by looking at the resulting meat, dairy, or egg products. The only way to verify the presence of GMOs in animal feed is to analyze the origin of the feed itself.\"\n\nA 2012 literature review of studies evaluating the effect of GM feed on the health of animals did not find evidence that animals were adversely affected, although small biological differences were occasionally found. The studies included in the review ranged from 90 days to two years, with several of the longer studies considering reproductive and intergenerational effects.\n\nEnzymes produced by genetically modified microorganisms are also integrated into animal feed to enhance availability of nutrients and overall digestion. These enzymes may also provide benefit to the gut microbiome of an animal, as well as hydrolyse antinutritional factors present in the feed.\n\nRennet is a mixture of enzymes used to coagulate milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.\n\nFPC was the first artificially produced enzyme to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and as of 2015 had yet to be surpassed in commercial markets. In 1999, about 60% of US hard cheese was made with FPC. Its global market share approached 80%. By 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC.\n\nIn some countries, recombinant (GM) bovine somatotropin (also called rBST, or bovine growth hormone or BGH) is approved for administration to increase milk production. rBST may be present in milk from rBST treated cows, but it is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected into the human bloodstream, has no observable effect on humans. The FDA, World Health Organization, American Medical Association, American Dietetic Association and the National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, on 30 September 2010, the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, analyzing submitted evidence, found a \"compositional difference\" between milk from rBGH-treated cows and milk from untreated cows. The court stated that milk from rBGH-treated cows has: increased levels of the hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); higher fat content and lower protein content when produced at certain points in the cow's lactation cycle; and more somatic cell counts, which may \"make the milk turn sour more quickly\".\n\nGenetically modified livestock are organisms from the group of cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, birds, horses and fish kept for human consumption, whose genetic material (DNA) has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. In some cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the animals which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. transgenesis.\n\nA 2003 review published on behalf of Food Standards Australia New Zealand examined transgenic experimentation on terrestrial livestock species as well as aquatic species such as fish and shellfish. The review examined the molecular techniques used for experimentation as well as techniques for tracing the transgenes in animals and products as well as issues regarding transgene stability.\n\nSome mammals typically used for food production have been modified to produce non-food products, a practice sometimes called Pharming.\n\nA GM salmon, awaiting regulatory approval since 1997, was approved for human consumption by the American FDA in November 2015, to be raised in specific land-based hatcheries in Canada and Panama.\n\nThere is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.\n\nOpponents claim that long-term health risks have not been adequately assessed and propose various combinations of additional testing, labeling or removal from the market. The advocacy group European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility (ENSSER), disputes the claim that \"science\" supports the safety of current GM foods, proposing that each GM food must be judged on case-by-case basis.\n\nThe legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Countries such as the United States, Canada, Lebanon and Egypt use \"substantial equivalence\" to determine if further testing is required, while many countries such as those in the European Union, Brazil and China only authorize GMO cultivation on a case-by-case basis. In the U.S. the FDA determined that GMO's are \"Generally Recognized as Safe\" (GRAS) and therefore do not require additional testing if the GMO product is substantially equivalent to the non-modified product. If new substances are found, further testing may be required to satisfy concerns over potential toxicity, allergenicity, possible gene transfer to humans or genetic outcrossing to other organisms.\n\nGovernment regulation of GMO development and release varies widely between countries. Marked differences separate GMO regulation in the U.S. and GMO regulation in the European Union. Regulation also varies depending on the intended product's use. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.\n\nIn the U.S., three government organizations regulate GMOs. The FDA checks the chemical composition of organisms for potential allergens. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) supervises field testing and monitors the distribution of GM seeds. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for monitoring pesticide usage, including plants modified to contain proteins toxic to insects. Like USDA, EPA also oversees field testing and the distribution of crops that have had contact with pesticides to ensure environmental safety. In 2015 the Obama administration announced that it would update the way the government regulated GM crops.\n\nIn 1992 FDA published \"Statement of Policy: Foods derived from New Plant Varieties\". This statement is a clarification of FDA's interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to foods produced from new plant varieties developed using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) technology. FDA encouraged developers to consult with the FDA regarding any bioengineered foods in development. The FDA says developers routinely do reach out for consultations. In 1996 FDA updated consultation procedures.\n\nThe StarLink corn recalls occurred in the autumn of 2000, when over 300 food products were found to contain a genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food.\n\nAs of 2015, 64 countries require labeling of GMO products in the marketplace.\n\nUS and Canadian national policy is to require a label only given significant composition differences or documented health impacts, although some individual US states (Vermont, Connecticut and Maine) enacted laws requiring them. In July 2016, Public Law 114-214 was enacted to regulate labeling of GMO food on a national basis.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the labeling requirement depends on the relative quantity of GMO in the product. A study that investigated voluntary labeling in South Africa found that 31% of products labeled as GMO-free had a GM content above 1.0%.\n\nIn the European Union all food (including processed food) or feed that contains greater than 0.9% GMOs must be labelled.\n\nTesting on GMOs in food and feed is routinely done using molecular techniques such as PCR and bioinformatics.\n\nIn a January 2010 paper, the extraction and detection of DNA along a complete industrial soybean oil processing chain was described to monitor the presence of Roundup Ready (RR) soybean: \"The amplification of soybean lectin gene by end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully achieved in all the steps of extraction and refining processes, until the fully refined soybean oil. The amplification of RR soybean by PCR assays using event-specific primers was also achieved for all the extraction and refining steps, except for the intermediate steps of refining (neutralisation, washing and bleaching) possibly due to sample instability. The real-time PCR assays using specific probes confirmed all the results and proved that it is possible to detect and quantify genetically modified organisms in the fully refined soybean oil. To our knowledge, this has never been reported before and represents an important accomplishment regarding the traceability of genetically modified organisms in refined oils.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas Redick, detection and prevention of cross-pollination is possible through the suggestions offered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Suggestions include educating farmers on the importance of coexistence, providing farmers with tools and incentives to promote coexistence, conduct research to understand and monitor gene flow, provide assurance of quality and diversity in crops, provide compensation for actual economic losses for farmers.\n\nThe genetically modified foods controversy consists of a set of disputes over the use of food made from genetically modified crops. The disputes involve consumers, farmers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations, environmental and political activists and scientists. The major disagreements include whether GM foods can be safely consumed, harm the environment and/or are adequately tested and regulated. The objectivity of scientific research and publications has been challenged. Farming-related disputes include the use and impact of pesticides, seed production and use, side effects on non-GMO crops/farms, and potential control of the GM food supply by seed companies.\n\nThe conflicts have continued since GM foods were invented. They have occupied the media, the courts, local, regional, national governments, and international organizations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216592", "title": "Postal stationery", "text": "Postal stationery\n\nA piece of postal stationery is a stationery item, such as a stamped envelope, letter sheet, postal card, lettercard, aerogram or wrapper, with an imprinted stamp or inscription indicating that a specific rate of postage or related service has been prepaid. It does \"not\", however, include any postcard without a pre-printed stamp.\n\nIn general, postal stationery is handled similarly to postage stamps; sold from post offices either at the face value of the printed postage or, more likely, with a surcharge to cover the additional cost of the stationery. It can take the form of an official mail issue produced only for the use of government departments. It can be an issue of a military force where an army, perhaps in a distant war, issues letter sheets for the use of its troops to write home. Postal stationery can be overprinted by the government or, occasionally, by a private overprint. In emergency situations, postal stationery has been produced by handstamping envelopes with modified canceling devices; many of the rare Confederate postmasters' provisionals are of this form. Finally, some postal stationery can be printed to private order. In this last case, stamped stationery bearing indicia is applied with postal administration approval and with specified regulations, to paper or cards provided by private persons or organizations. Private impressions result in a wider range of denominations and designs compared with governmental issues.\n\nThe postal services of some countries also offer a form of letter sheet called an aerogram consisting of a blank sheet of paper with folding instructions and adhesive flaps that becomes its own envelope, and carries prepaid postage at either the international airmail letter rate or at a special lower aerogram rate. Letter sheets lend themselves to airmail usage because they are lightweight. Enclosures are not permitted in aerograms. Sales of aerograms in the United States ended in 2006 due to poor sales.\n\nA letter card almost has the advantages of a postal card as far as weight and size, but also the advantage of privacy of contents is concerned. It is a double card, folded over, with gum or adhesive applied to the three open edges. It is then opened by the recipient by tearing perforations on the three sides that are on the message side of the gum. The gummed strip around the card is then discarded, giving rise to the problems collectors have in finding intact used cards. The US has never issued any letter cards.\n\nBefore 1845 correspondence was not enclosed in an envelope. Letters were folded, sealed, addressed and postmarked on the outside. This continued even after adhesive postage stamps were introduced. The popularity of folded letters led postal authorities to introduce stamped letter sheets. These became available in the U.S. in 1861, but the first official postal stationery were the 1838 embossed letter sheets of New South Wales. These were followed by the Mulready stationery that was issued by Great Britain at the same time as the Penny Black in 1840. Since then, most postal services have issued a steady stream of stationery alongside stamps. Often the design of the stationery mimics the contemporaneous stamps, though with less variety and lower printing quality, due to the limitations of printing directly onto the envelope. Much later, 1947 in the U.S., letter sheets morphed into lithographed air letter sheets or aerograms.\n\nPostal cards are postal stationery and have a printed or embossed indicium and are sold by governmental postal authorities. In the United States, they were first produced in 1873. Some of the forms taken by postal cards include the regular single card, the attached message-reply cards, airmail postal cards, and official postal cards used for official government business with a \"penalty for private use\". \n\nPostcards, on the other hand, are cards prepared by private companies that do not have prepaid franking and readily available at commercial outlets. They are frequently illustrated with pictures or printed advertisements. They are generally \"not\" considered postal stationery.\n\nA strong envelope with an imprinted stamp sold only for use with the registered mail service. Confusingly, these are usually marked \"Registered Letter\" but that term strictly only relates to a normal letter or packet that has extra postage and markings applied so that it may travel under the registered mail service.\n\nThe envelope form may be called a stamped envelope or, alternatively, a postal stationery envelope (PSE for short). In August 1852 an act of the U.S. Congress authorized the Postmaster General to provide \"suitable letter envelopes with such watermarks or other guards against counterfeits... with the addition of the value or denomination of the postage stamps so printed or impressed thereon...\". The first result was the 1853 Nesbitt issues of stamped envelopes, named after the contractor who produced them for the government. Considering the different envelope sizes, knives, colors, dies to print the indicia, and denominations there are literally thousands of different stamped envelopes produced for the US\n\nThe manufacture of wrappers for the sending of newspapers or periodicals began in the U.S. in 1861. The first wrappers were rectangular pieces of paper with gum to seal it on one end and an embossed envelope stamp or indicium on it. By 1870, the form was that of a rectangle with the narrow side rounded and gummed at the top. They were manufactured from piles of 300 - 500 sheets of paper which were then cut to shape by a knife. After around 1900, they were cut individually from long ribbons of paper which had been printed with an embossed envelope die.\n\nIn the US, they were removed from the items for sale in 1934, though remainders were sold for several years after that. By 1940 most countries had discontinued their production due to declining demand. Because the recipient of a wrapped newspaper often tore it open and threw it away, untorn used wrappers, preferred by collectors, are scarce. Scarcer yet are wrappers with the original newspaper contents. Because of their larger size, even mint copies are often sold folded or creased which is also less desirable to collectors.\n\nMost postal stationery pieces are collected as entires, that is, the whole card, sheet or envelope. In the 19th century the practice was to collect \"cut squares\" (or \"cut-outs\" in the UK) which involved clipping the embossed indicia from a postal envelope. This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The manner in which the stamped envelope is cut out (defined by the term \"knife\") vanishes on a cut square. Thus most collectors prefer entires to cut squares.\n\nMany country-specific stamp catalogs list postal stationery and there are books devoted to the postal stationery of individual countries. The current, but now dated, principal encyclopedic work is the nineteen volume Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog.\n\nCollectors of postal stationery may seek out postal stationery societies or study groups in other countries. These societies provide information, publications and guidance to those who are interested. They include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216990", "title": "Borscht", "text": "Borscht\n\nBorscht () is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and across Russia. The variety most often associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin, and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which gives the dish its distinctive red color. It shares the name, however, with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based green borscht, rye-based white borscht and cabbage borscht.\n\nBorscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common hogweed (\"Heracleum sphondylium\"), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables, which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with \"smetana\" or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as ' or ', that can be served with the soup. \n\nIts popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local guises, as their own national dish consumed as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.\n\nThe English word \"borscht\", also spelled \"borsch\", \"borsht\", or \"bortsch\", comes from Yiddish ('). The latter derives from the word ('), which is common to East Slavic languages, such as Ukrainian or Russian.\n\nTogether with cognates in other Slavic languages, it comes from Proto-Slavic \"*bŭrščǐ\" 'hogweed' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*bhr̥sti-\" < \"*bhares-/bhores-\" 'point, stubble'. Common hogweed (\"\") was the soup's principal ingredient before it was replaced with other vegetables, notably beetroot. The beetroot borscht was invented in what is now Ukraine and first popularized in North America by Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe.\n\nTypical Ukrainian borscht is traditionally made from meat or bone stock, sautéed vegetables, and beet sour (i.e., fermented beetroot juice). Depending on the recipe, some of these components may be omitted or substituted for.\nThe stock is typically made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork or a combination of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.\n\nThe vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip may be used as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form ' rather than '. Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.\nThe dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as \"chametz\" (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as \"kvas\" (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as ' (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian ' 'pickle juice', Polish \"\" 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.\n\nAs the traditional method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning at least several days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with a wide selection of herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.\n\nAs the home country of beetroot borscht, Ukraine boasts great diversity of the soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.\n\nMany regional recipes for borscht have also developed in Russian cuisine. Examples include the Moscow borscht, served with pieces of beef, ham and Vienna sausages; Siberian borscht with meatballs; and Pskov borscht with dried smelt from the local lakes. Other unique Russian variants include a monastic Lenten borscht with marinated kelp instead of cabbage and the Russian Navy borscht (\"), the defining characteristic of which is that the vegetables are cut into square or diamond-shaped chunks rather than julienned.\nAs well as the thick borschts described above, Polish cuisine offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as ', or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat may be used for the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with sour cream. ', or Christmas Eve borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for \" (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.\n\nAshkenazi Jews living in Eastern Europe adopted beetroot borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted it to their taste and religious requirements. As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (') and dairy ('). The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness. Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim so that it would be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.\n\nIn the summertime, cold borscht is a popular alternative to the aforementioned variants, which are normally served hot. It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir or yogurt. The mixture has a distinctive pink or magenta color. It is served refrigerated, typically over finely chopped beetroot, cucumbers, radishes and green onion, together with halves of a hard-boiled egg and sprinkled with fresh dill. Chopped veal, ham, or crawfish tails may be added as well. \n\nThis soup probably originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which comprised the territories of modern-day Lithuania and Belarus, and it is still part of the culinary traditions of these and neighboring nations. The Lithuanian language is the only one in the region which actually refers to it as 'cold borscht' ('). In Belarusian it is known simply as ', or 'cold soup'; in Polish as \"chłodnik litewski\", or 'Lithuanian cold soup'; and in Russian as \"\", or 'beetroot soup'.\n\nAlthough in the English language \"borscht\" refers almost invariably to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures there exist soups with the same or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.\n\nGreen borscht (\"), a light soup made from leaf vegetables, is an example common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The naturally tart-tasting sorrel is most commonly used, but spinach, chard, nettle, garden orache and occasionally dandelion, goutweed or ramsons, may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, it is based on meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.\n\nIn Polish cuisine, white borscht (', also known as ' or \", 'sour soup') is made from a fermented mixture of rye flour or oatmeal and water. It is typically flavored with garlic and marjoram, and served over eggs and boiled fresh sausage; the water in which the sausage was boiled is often used instead of meat stock. \nIn the Carpathian Mountains of southern Poland, variants of borscht are also made in which the tart taste comes from dairy products, such as whey or buttermilk. Although the deep red color of beetroot borscht may remind those unfamiliar with Polish cuisine of blood, the kind of borscht that does contain animal (usually poultry) blood mixed with vinegar is dark brownish-gray in color and aptly called \"gray borscht\" ('), which is a regional name of the Polish blood soup better known as '.\n\nIn Romanian and Moldovan cuisines, a mixture of wheat bran or cornmeal with water that has been left to ferment, similar to, but less cloudy than that used in Polish white borscht, is called '. It is used to impart a sour taste to a variety of tangy Romanian soups, known as either also ' or '. Variants include ' (with meatballs), ' (with tripe), ' (with fish) and \" (with beetroots).\nThe Armenian version of borscht is a hot soup made with beef stock, green peppers and other vegetables, which may or may not include beetroots, and flavored with parsley and cilantro. In ethnic Mennonite cuisine, \"borscht\" refers to a whole range of seasonal vegetable soups based on beef or chicken stock – from spring borscht made with spinach, sorrel and chard to summer borscht with cabbage, tomatoes, corn and squash to fall and winter borscht with cabbage, beets and potatoes. In Chinese cuisine, a soup known as \", or \"Russian soup\", is based on red cabbage and tomatoes, and lacks beetroots altogether; also known as \"Chinese borscht\", it originated in Harbin, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as Hong Kong. In Shanghai's Haipai cuisine, tomatoes are the main ingredient; beef and its broth, onions and cabbages are also added; while flour, rather than sour cream, is used for thickening.\n\nThe diversity of borscht styles is matched by the wide choice of garnishes and side dishes with which various kinds of borscht may be served.\nMost often, borscht is served with sour cream, the East European version of which, known as \", is runnier than its American counterpart. The sour cream may be served in a separate pitcher for the diners to add the desired amount themselves or the borscht may come already \"whitened\", that is, blended with sour cream. Sometimes the cream is thickened with flour before being added to the soup. Yogurt and a mixture of milk and yolks are possible substitutes.\n\nChopped herbs are often sprinkled on the surface of the soup; dill is most common, but parsley, chives or scallion are often added as well. Individual helpings may be spiced up with minced hot peppers or garlic. Many kinds of borscht are served over halves or quarters of hard-boiled chicken or quail eggs. Navy beans, broad beans or string beans are also a common addition.\nMeat, removed from the stock on which the borscht was based, may be cut into smaller chunks and either added back into the soup or served on the side with horseradish or mustard. Bacon and sausages are also commonly used as borscht garnishes. Borscht based on bone stock may be served Old Polish style, with marrow from the bones.\n\nSome kinds of the soup, such as Poltava borscht, may be served with \",\" or thick noodles of wheat or buckwheat flour. Siberian borscht is eaten with boiled meatballs (') of minced beef and onion. In Poland and parts of western Ukraine, borscht is typically ladled over ', or bite-sized ear-shaped dumplings made from pasta dough wrapped around mushroom, buckwheat or meat filling. Mushroom-filled \" are particularly associated with Polish Christmas Eve borscht.\n\nBorscht, like any other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather accompanied by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.\nIn Ukraine, borscht is often accompanied with ', or savory, puffy yeast-raised rolls glazed with oil and crushed garlic. In Russian cuisine, borscht may be served with any of assorted side dishes based on ', or the East European variant of farmer cheese, such as ', ' or '. ' are baked round cheese-filled tarts; ' are small pancakes wherein the cheese is mixed into the batter; and a ' is a casserole of buckwheat groats baked with cheese.\n\n', or baked dumplings with fillings as for ', are another common side for both thick and clear variants of borscht. Polish clear borscht may be also served with a croquette or '. A typical Polish croquette (') is made by wrapping a ' (thin pancake) around a filling and coating it in breadcrumbs before refrying; ' (literally, 'little ') are variously shaped filled hand-held pastries of yeast-raised or flaky dough. An even more exquisite way to serve borscht is with a coulibiac, or a large loaf-shaped pie. Possible fillings for croquettes, ' and coulibiacs include mushrooms, sauerkraut and minced meat.\n\nBorscht derives from a soup originally made by the Slavs from common hogweed (\", also known as cow parsnip), which lent the dish its Slavic name. Growing commonly in damp meadows throughout the north temperate zone, hogweed was used not only as fodder (as its English names suggest), but also for human consumption – from Eastern Europe to Siberia, to northwestern North America.\n\nThe Slavs collected hogweed in May and used its roots for stewing with meat, while the stems, leaves and umbels were chopped, covered with water and left in a warm place to ferment. After a few days, lactic and alcoholic fermentation produced a mixture described as \"something between beer and sauerkraut\". This concoction was then used for cooking a soup characterized by a mouth-puckering sour taste and pungent smell. As the Polish ethnographer wrote in 1830, \"Poles have been always partial to tart dishes, which are somewhat peculiar to their homeland and vital to their health.\"\n\nThe earliest written reference to the Slavic hogweed soup can be found in \"\" (\"Domestic Order\"), a 16th-century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice. It recommends growing the plant \"by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows\", to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, \"for the Lord's sake, share it with those in need\". Simon Syrenius (), a 17th-century Polish botanist, described \"our Polish hogweed\" as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, Ruthenia, Lithuania and Samogitia (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a \"tasty and graceful soup\" with capon stock, eggs, sour cream and millet. More interested in the plant's medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover.\n\nHogweed borscht was mostly a poor man's food. The soup's humble beginnings are still reflected in Polish fixed expressions, where \"cheap like borscht\" is the equivalent of \"dirt cheap\" (also attested as a calque in Yiddish and Canadian English), whereas adding \"two mushrooms into borscht\" is synonymous with excess. For the professors of the University of Kraków, who led a monastic way of life in the 17th century, hogweed borscht was a fasting dish which they ate regularly (sometimes with deviled eggs) from Lent till Rogation days. It was uncommon on the royal table, although according to the 16th-century Polish botanist Marcin of Urzędów – citing , a court physician to the Jagiellonian kings of Hungary – the Polish-born King Vladislaus II used to have a Polish hogweed-based dish prepared for him at his court in Buda.\n\nWith time, other ingredients were added to the soup, eventually replacing hogweed altogether, and the names ' or ' became generic terms for any sour-tasting soup. In 19th-century rural Poland, this term included soups made from barberries, currants, gooseberries, cranberries, celery or plums.\nWhen describing the uses of common hogweed, John Gerard, a 17th-century English botanist, observed that \"the people of [Poland] and Lithuania [used] to make [a] drink with the decoction of this herb and leaven or some other thing made of meal, which is used instead of beer and other ordinary drink.\" It may suggest that hogweed soup was on some occasions combined with a fermented mixture of water and barley flour, oatmeal or rye flour. Such soured, gelatinous flour-and-water mixture, originally known as kissel (from the Proto-Slavic root \"*kyslŭ\", 'sour') had been already mentioned in \"The Tale of Bygone Years\", a 12th-century chronicle of Kievan Rus', and continued to be a staple of Ukrainian and Russian cooking until the middle of the 19th century. In Poland, a soup based on diluted kissel became known as either ' (from Middle High German ' 'sour') or ' and later – to distinguish it from the red beetroot borscht – as ' 'white borscht'.\n\nThe earliest known Polish recipes for borscht, written by chefs catering to Polish magnates (aristocrats), are from the late 17th century. , head chef to Prince , included several borscht recipes in his ' (\"A Collection of Dishes\"), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include such sour soups as lemon borscht and \"royal borscht\", the latter made from assorted dried, smoked or fresh fish and fermented rye bran. A manuscript recipe collection from the family court, dating back to ca. 1686, contains an instruction for making hogweed borscht mixed with poppy seeds or ground almonds. As this was a Lenten dish, it was garnished, in a ' fashion typical of Baroque cuisine, with mock eggs made from finely chopped pike that was partly dyed with saffron and formed into oval balls. An alternative recipe for the almond borscht replaced pickled hogweed with vinegar.\nBorscht also evolved into a variety of sour soups to the east of Poland. Examples include onion borscht, a recipe for which was included in a 1905 Russian cookbook, and sorrel-based green borscht, which is still a popular summer soup in Ukraine and Russia. \"A Gift to Young Housewives\" by Elena Molokhovets, the best-selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century, first published in 1861, contains nine recipes for borscht, some of which are based on kvass, a traditional Slavic fermented beverage made from rye bread. Kvass-based variants were also known in Ukraine at that time; some of them were types of green borscht, while others were similar to the Russian \"\".\n\nBefore the advent of beet-based borscht, cabbage borscht was of particular importance. Made from either fresh cabbage or sauerkraut, it could be indistinguishable from the Russian '. Indeed, the mid-19th-century \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\" defines ' as \"a kind of \"\"\" with beet sour added for tartness. The significance of cabbage as an essential ingredient of borscht is manifest in the Ukrainian proverb, \"without bread, it's no lunch; without cabbage, it's no borscht.\"\n\nBeet ('), a plant native to the Mediterranean Basin, was already grown in antiquity. Only the leaves were of culinary use, as the tapered, tough, whitish and bitter-tasting root was considered unfit for human consumption. It is likely that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before the invention of the beetroot-based red borscht. Beet varieties with round, red, sweet taproots, known as beetroots, were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century. , a Polish Renaissance poet and moralist, included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled beetroots in his 1568 book, \"Life of an Honest Man\". It would later evolve into ', or \", a beet-and-horseradish relish popular in Polish and Jewish cuisines. also recommended the \"very tasty brine\" left over from beetroot pickling, which was an early version of beet sour. The sour found some applications in Polish folk medicine as a cure for hangover and – mixed with honey – as a sore throat remedy.\n\nIt may never be known who first thought of using beet sour to flavor borscht, which also gave the soup its now-familiar red color. 's Polish-German dictionary published in 1806 was the first to define \" as a tart soup made from pickled beetroots. The fact that certain 19th-century Russian and Polish cookbooks, such as \"Handbook of the Experienced Russian Housewife\" (1842) by and \"The Lithuanian Cook\" (1854) by , refer to beetroot-based borscht as \"Little Russian borscht\" (where \"Little Russian\" is a term used at the time for ethnic Ukrainians under imperial Russian rule) suggests that this innovation took place in what is now Ukraine, whose soils and climate are particularly well suited to beet cultivation. Ukrainian legends, probably of 19th-century origin, attribute the invention of beetroot borscht either to Zaporozhian Cossacks, serving in the Polish army, on their way to break the siege of Vienna in 1683, or to Don Cossacks, serving in the Russian army, while laying siege to Azov in 1695.\nSpanish conquistadors brought potatoes and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour as the source of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.\n\nOver the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht's popularity spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia's growing political clout and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out of the country. As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran, to Central Asia and China, to Alaska (Russian America).\nBorscht's westward expansion was less successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup along with other East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant ' dish with an air of eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an oxtail, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef quenelles, deviled eggs and croûtons. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of ' (\"borscht soup\") in French cuisine. and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, ', published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, ' (\"Polish-style beet-juice soup\"), which had been changed to \"\" by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with herrings, sturgeon, coulibiac, Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad, at a Russian-themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.\n\nMass migration from the Russian Empire to North America – initially mostly by members of persecuted religious minorities – was instrumental in bringing borscht across the Atlantic. The earliest waves of migration occurred at a time when cabbage-based borscht was still the dominant variant of the soup in at least parts of Russia. The Mennonites, who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia's Volga region in the 1870s, still eschew beetroots in their borscht; instead, Mennonite varieties include ' (with cabbage or sauerkraut) and ' (sorrel-based \"summer borscht\"). According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" published in 1906, cabbage-based \"kraut borscht\" was also more popular than the beet-based variant in American Jewish cuisine at the time. Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America.\nIn the 1930s, when most American hotels refused to accept Jewish guests due to widespread anti-Semitism, New York Jews began flocking to Jewish-owned resorts in the Catskill Mountains for their summer vacations. The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment, with restaurants offering all-you-can-eat Ashkenazi Jewish fare, including copious amounts of borscht. Grossinger's, one of the largest resorts, served borscht throughout the day, every day of the year. The region became known, initially in derision, as the \"Borscht Belt\", reinforcing the popular association between borscht and American Jewish culture. As most visitors arrived in the summertime, the borscht was typically served cold. Marc Gold was one of its largest suppliers, producing 1,750 short tons (1,590 tonnes) a year in his business's heyday. Gold's borscht consists of puréed beetroots seasoned with sugar, salt and citric acid; it is usually blended with sour cream and served as a refreshing beverage, more aptly described as a \"beet smoothie\". Such kind of \"purplish, watery broth\" is, according to Nikolai Burlakoff, author of \"The World of Russian Borsch\", \"associated in America with borsch, in general, and Jewish borsch in particular.\"\n\nIn the Soviet Union, borscht was one of the most popular everyday dishes. It was described by James Meek, a British correspondent in Kiev and Moscow, as \"the common denominator of the Soviet kitchen, the dish that tied together ... the high table of the Kremlin and the meanest canteen in the boondocks of the Urals, ... the beetroot soup that pumped like a main artery through the kitchens of the east Slav lands\". Among Soviet leaders, the Ukrainian-born Leonid Brezhnev was especially partial to borscht, which his wife continued to personally cook for him even after they had moved into the Kremlin.\nThe soup has even played a role in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a communications equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.\n\nBorscht is often associated with its role in religious traditions of various denominations (Eastern Orthodox, Greek and Roman Catholic, and Jewish) that are common in Eastern Europe. In East Slavic countries, \"memorial borscht\" is served as the first course at a post-funeral wake. According to a traditional belief, the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by puffs of steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes, such as blini, porridge, boiled potatoes or freshly baked bread. In the region of Polesye, straddling the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, the same steaming-hot dishes, including borscht, are given as an offering to the souls of deceased ancestors during the annual semi-pagan remembrance ceremony known as \" or Forefathers' Night.\nIn Poland and Ukraine, borscht is usually one of the dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner. Celebrated after the first star has appeared in the sky on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which is at the same time festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin. Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream. In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour dry-roasted in a pan instead of the usual roux. The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth. Both Ukrainian and Polish variants are often served with \".\n\nWhile Christmas in Poland is traditionally linked to red borscht, Lent – the fasting period that leads up to Easter – is associated with a meatless version of white borscht, or \". Youths used to celebrate Holy Saturday, the last day of the fast, with a mock \"funeral\" of the white borscht, in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken, sometimes – to the crowd's amusement – while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head. On the next day, the white borscht would reappear on the Easter table, but this time, in its more coveted, meat-based guise with sausage, bacon and eggs.\n\nIn Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as \", is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to provide an opportunity to use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended with sour cream is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.\n\nIn its currently most popular, beet-based version, borscht most likely originated in what is now Ukraine. Borscht's role as a staple of everyday Ukrainian diet is reflected in the Ukrainian saying, \"borscht and porridge are our food\" (compare the equivalent Russian saying, where borscht is replaced with \"\"). The hearty soup in which the beetroot is just one of sundry vegetables, as opposed to the typically Polish clear beet broth, is still known in Poland as \"Ukrainian borscht\".\n\nBorscht is associated with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, in the words of Burlakoff, \"is perfectly suited to a global culture.\" He describes it as \"a global phenomenon\", in which \"local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition.\" In his view, borscht \"is an almost perfect example of ... 'glocalization' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation; ... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones.\" However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, \"people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it.\" Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of \"a common connection between culinary and territorial claims\", which results in the culinary area turning into \"a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths.\"\nIn the Soviet Union, government-sponsored cookbooks, such as \"The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food\" curated by Anastas Mikoyan, \"Cookery\" and \"Directory of Recipes and Culinary Production\", promoted a unified Soviet cuisine with standardized and nutritionally \"rational\" versions of traditional dishes. The same cooking techniques and recipes were taught in culinary vocational schools throughout the country, establishing a common cooking style in Soviet cafés and restaurants. Though inspired by the cuisines of the country's various ethnic groups, many recipes were presented as part of an overall Soviet heritage, disassociated from their individual geographic origins. By many people both inside and outside the Soviet Union, borscht was increasingly seen not as an ethnic Ukrainian soup, but as a Soviet or – metonymically – Russian dish. This approach was criticized by William Pokhlebkin, a preeminent Russian food writer, who unequivocally described beet-based borscht as one of the \"dishes of Ukrainian cookery\" which \"have entered the menu of international cuisine\". \"One could understand\", he wrote, \"and forgive foreigners for calling borscht or \"\" Russian national dishes, but when it turns out that they gleaned the information from Soviet cookbooks or from restaurant menus, one is embarrassed for our authors and chefs, who popularize the national cuisines of our peoples [that is, the ethnic groups of the Soviet Union] with such ignorance.\"\n\nAccording to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore political boundaries. ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.\n\n\n\n\n"}
