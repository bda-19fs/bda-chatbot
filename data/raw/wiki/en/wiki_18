{"id": "5802649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5802649", "title": "Taxicabs by country", "text": "Taxicabs by country\n\nTaxicabs in a single country often share a set of common properties, but there is a wide variation from country to country in the vehicles used, the circumstances under which they may be hired and the regulatory regime to which these are subject.\n\nOld-style Toyota Corolla, Toyota Corona, GAZ-21\"Volga\", VAZ-2101 \"Zhiguli\", and Lada taxi cabs in Afghanistan are still used as regular taxis.\n\nIn Albania, taxicabs are easily found. In Tirana, the capital city, they are all painted in yellow, with various signs on the roof. The official taxis have yellow plates with red text. The Albanian word is \"taksi\", but most of the signs are in English. Lately the law has required taxi drivers to buy cars that are less than 10 years old. 90% of taxicabs are private: there are only two companies operating and they only operate in Tirana. Apart from these two companies, very few drivers use taximeters.\nIn Argentina taxicabs are called 'taxis'. In the capital Buenos Aires (and Rosario and others) the colours of the taxis are black, with yellow roofs, as a reference to the many Peugeot 504 which served as taxis in the 1980s, which used the same paint layout. The licensing is a central government function.\nToday, most models are Chevrolet Corsa and Fiat Siena, with retrofitted or factory-built NGV power plants which means much lower fuel costs than gasoline.\nAustralia used horse-drawn taxis once cities were established (as had been used in Europe in the early 19th century). Motor vehicle taxis were introduced into Australia not long after they were put into service in the United Kingdom and Europe. In 1906, Sydney inaugurated motorised taxis and in approximately 1907 so did Queensland, and other states followed soon after.\n\nThe progress through the years included many types of tourers from the 1910 era until the late 1920s, with British and American cars predominating.\n\nSedans were added during the late 1920s and included similar makes of vehicles. This was the case with all cars being imported into Australia until World War II began. American cars proved more suitable to Australian motoring conditions especially for taxis. General Motors Corporation built thousands in Australia, as did the other American companies including Ford Motor Company and Chrysler.\n\nThe release of hybrid cars has been slow, but is beginning to replace LPG taxis.\n\nTaxis in Bangladesh are generally Toyota Corolla (E160)s, Toyota Premios or Toyota Allions in yellow. Taxi fares generally start from 80 taka per kilometer. Almost all taxis now run on LPG as well as diesel.\n\nUntil the fall of socialism in Bulgaria, all taxis were VAZ-2101 and Moskvitch 2138. Today in Sofia, Hyundai Sonata taxis are mainly found.\nIn 2013, \"green\" Toyota Prius taxis were introduced.\n\nIn China, taxicabs are very common throughout the country. Tencent's Dididache is a smartphone application especially designed for Meizu, Zte and Huawei which matches passengers and willing taxi drivers who are situated in close proximity. For passengers, a list of nearby taxicabs is created via GPS, and a signal is sent out indicating an expression of interest. Conversely, for taxi drivers with the app installed on their phones, the GPS system quickly lists and localizes nearby potential clients; and once a match is created, the taxi can efficiently pick up awaiting passengers.\n\nDididache is a dominant player in China's taxi-hailing arena, with a market share exceeding 60% and service extending to 32 cities including the Tier-1 conurbations of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Dididache in 2014 has 40 million registered users, a doubling from 2013's user base; and every month, more than 21 million cab rides are booked through the service, or 700,000 bookings per day. Additionally, from the taxicab perspective, Dididache already has an extensive user base of taxi drivers of more than 350,000 vehicles across China.\nEven in very small villages, there will be cars for hire. In smaller towns and villages, taxicabs are generally unregulated and may consist of a bike with a carriage, or more commonly, motorcycles with extensions that allow three people to sit in the rear. Even in large cities, taxicabs are generally very lax forms of transportation. Taxicabs in Shanghai may not refuse to go to any destination within the city. Relative to the west, taxicabs are very cheap, and in smaller areas the fare may be 1 yuan per person.\n\nIn Colombia taxicabs are yellow in most of the cities. The most common taxicab around is the Hyundai Atos, praised for its fuel economy. Other similar, popular taxicab vehicles include the Chevrolet Matiz and the Kia Picanto\n\nTaxicabs are common in Egypt, particularly in the larger cities. The taxi system is highly decentralized, with the cab generally belonging to the driver and operated as a private business by him. Consequently, there is some variation in the types of cars used as taxis, although the Tofaş Şahin (including the licensed version produced by Nasr) and Hyundai Accent predominate. Drivers must obtain a taxi license from the government, generally through the offices of the Governorate in which they are based; however, taxis are permitted to operate between cities. Drivers must also paint their cars according to a livery unique to each governorate, including painting the license plate number of the cab on its doors in both Arabic and English. The traditional liveries of Cairo (black and white) and Alexandria (yellow and black) are well-known to all Egyptians and indeed across the Arab world from their appearance in Egyptian film and television.\n\nMeters are technically required by Egyptian law, but they generally go unused and in many cases do not even work. The prime exception is in Cairo, where a new class of taxi with a different livery (white with a black checkered band around the middle) have electronic meters installed and used. In most other cases, the price of a journey is generally determined through negotiation or bargaining between the passenger and driver, either just after the cab is hailed or just after the destination is reached.\n\nMany if not most Egyptian taxi drivers have some education and frequently work in white collar professions that nevertheless come with low pay (generally low-level government work, including education); taxis are a common source of supplemental income for many Egyptian families. Consequently, taxi drivers are a common source of \"vox populi\" for foreign media sources.\n\nIn Eritrea all taxis are yellow. In the capital, Asmara, they are all new yellow Kia, Toyota and Mercedes Benz. There are often five passenger seats.\nThe taxis are owned by the same company all over Asmara. The taxi traffic starts slowing down after 9 pm in the northernmost part of the city's suburbs, but the inner city and southern side of the town have a lot of taxis. The taxis in Massawa are often large like mini buses, but are still taxis. They are also yellow.\n\nAfter World War II, Russian cars, especially Pobeda and Volga, dominated the taxi market in Finland for several years. In the late 1950s the import restriction on cars was lifted for taxi operators, which made it feasible to import western cars in larger numbers. By the end of 1960s Mercedes-Benz in particular had gained a dominant position, accounting for up to half the taxi stock, and the Finnish distributor of Mercedes, VEHO, even has a separate taxi sales department. Mercedes has remained the archetypal taxi ever since, although other makes such as Volvo (especially estate models) and the VAG brands are also common.\n\nTaxis in Finland do not have to be liveried in any particular colour or pattern. They are recognisable from the yellow 'TAKSI' sign on the roof, which is illuminated when the taxi is available for hire. Taxis mainly gather at special taxi ranks, rather than being 'hailed'. Customers either walk to the taxi rank and take the first available taxi from the front of the queue, or wait at the rank for a taxi to appear. One can also order a taxi by telephone etc. to a specific address.\n\nThe first horse-drawn forerunners of taxis appeared on Parisian streets in 1637. France was one of the first countries to use modern taxis—that is, gasoline-powered vehicles with fare meters in 1899. New York's first taxis were imported from France in 1907, and taxis were famously used for troop transportation during the First Battle of the Marne. Within last two decades a big part of taxis in France were Peugeot cars among them we can find the mythic Peugeot 406 used in \"\"Taxi\"\" the French action-comedy film. Other brands include Škoda, Citroën and Renault. Mercedes are common in Paris.\n\nMany French taxis included mainly Peugeot, Renault, and Citroën cabs by the past. Today Skoda, Mercedes BlueTec and Toyota Prius hybrid cars are also largely use.\n\nAn important event in the history of the taxi was the invention of the taximeter by Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav Bruhn, a German engineer, in 1891. The Daimler Victoria —the world's first meter-equipped (and gasoline-powered) taxicab—was built by Gottlieb Daimler in 1897, and began operation in Stuttgart that same year.\n\nIn Germany, taxis were required by law until November of 2005 to be \"light ivory\", RAL number 1015). Before 1971, they were required to be black. There is a small illuminated \"TAXI\" sign on the roof of the car (on when available, off otherwise). Typically the taxicabs are Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class, along with other, mainly German, brands. Taxicabs are either sedans, station wagons, or MPVs. Common station wagon taxicabs include Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Among the MPVs, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, and Mercedes-Benz Vianos are common. Most taxicabs have automatic transmission, and some have navigation systems on board. Fares are usually close to those of other western European countries; however, in Berlin taxis have a special low fare (€4) called \"Kurzstrecke\" for distances less than 2 km. Except in Portugal, in other western European capitals the minimum taxi fare usually costs double; nevertheless, the convenience and high quality of public transportation in most German cities eliminates the need for taxicabs. Although allowed, \"Street Hail\" is relatively uncommon in Germany because cabs rarely circle the cities when vacant. Because there are relatively few customers, most cabs return to assigned waiting stations and are called on demand. Although this has proven to be more economic for cab drivers, it is considered very inconvenient for commuters because taxis include the ride from the waiting station to the pickup point in the fare.\n\nIn Guyana, any vehicle registered with the first letter as \"H\" is a taxi. There are over 20,000 registered taxis in the country. Some cars are not registered to be taxis but still operate as them. They are called Private Hire cars and operate illegally in the country. They have \"P\" plates and are not authorised to operate as taxis. As of 2010 taxis are required to be painted yellow. They also have a sticker on the rear bumper that reads Hackney Carriage.\n\nDuring the early colonial times, sedan chairs were the only form of public conveyances. Public chairs were licensed, and charged according to tariffs which would be prominently displayed. Chair stands were found at all hotels, wharves, and major crossroads. Their numbers peaked in about 1920.\n\nThe pulled rickshaw, first imported from Japan in 1870, was a popular form of transport for many years, peaking at more than 7,000 in the early part of the 20th century. The rickshaw and sedan chair vied for customers depending on their budget, haste, or terrain to be negotiated. The rickshaw was more rapid, but was not suited to climbing the steep terrain of Hong Kong Island.\n\nRickshaws' popularity waned after World War II. There were about eight in 1998, and only four left in 2002. The last sedan chair was reportedly abandoned in 1965; and the rickshaws have disappeared since the ferry's closure at the end of 2006.\n\nThe earliest modern taxi service was first officially recorded by the government in 1947 with 329 cars.\n\nIn Hong Kong today, there are three types of taxis, painted in different colours, serving different parts of the territory. The most common one, which is painted in red. The red taxi serves throughout Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Green taxis serve the New Territories and blue taxis serve Lantau Island. Most taxis in Hong Kong are Toyota Crown Comforts. Taxis pick up passengers from streets, or by radio-dispatch by phone. Fares are charged according to the distance measured by meters. Surcharges include tolls, luggages and pets.\n\nIn Budapest, the capital of Hungary from 2013 every taxis must be painted in yellow.\n\nIn India, taxicabs have a yellow-black livery. The newer taxis are white, one of the many reasons why the expensive taxis have been dubbed White Taxis by the locals in cities. Taxis and all other commercial vehicles have a yellow number plate so charging taxes and toll in highways is easier for the officials.\n\nDepending on the city/state, taxis can either be hailed, booked through applications or can be hired from taxi-stands. In cities such as Bangalore, taxis need to be hired from taxi stands, whereas in cities like Kolkata and Mumbai, taxis can be hailed on the street. There are additional surcharges for luggage, late-night rides and toll taxes are to be paid by the passenger. Thanks to the booming economy but due to disparities in income many types of taxis have come up. For example, in Delhi there are 5 types of taxi. Auto rickshaws (most affordable), Normal Taxis, Radio Cabs, White Taxis and Tourist Taxis. In areas like Noida and Gurgaon auto rickshaws are banned thus giving the taxis a monopoly. Chandigarh also has a well established system of modern radio cabs.\n\nBy Government regulations all taxis are required to have a fare-meter installed. Taxis face stiff competition from auto rickshaws but in some cities, for example Mumbai, auto rickshaws are banned in the main city district, thus giving taxis a monopoly. This monopoly directly affects the kind of cars used in India as cabs as well as the kind of economical and transport conditions.\n\nTaxicabs began to be popular in Jakarta from the early 1970s with cars such as the Datsun 220C, Holden Torana, and Toyota Corona. Smaller cars, for example the Toyota Corolla, and various types of Datsun, were also used from mid-1970s to late 1980s.\n\nIn the 1970s, taxicabs were in various colors, although at that time mostly yellow, and a major operator ran light blue taxicabs. The main vehicle replacement for most taxicab operators was in mid-1980s when they replaced their old fleet with Nissan Stanza 1.6 T11. With the exception of the popular light blue, all other operators had their Stanzas painted yellow.\n\nDue to poor sales in the private car market, but good fuel economy and reliability, Holden Gemini diesel cars were used as taxicabs during the 1980s. The same happened to Nissan Sunnys and Ford Lasers from the late 1980s to late 1990s.\n\nSince the color of most reliable taxicab company in Jakarta is medium blue metallic (previously light blue), few other operators copied their color, and even the shape of the roof sign. This could mislead someone when hail the taxicab on the street. Although most taxicabs are blue, there are also painted in any color depends on the operators.\n\nThe new taxicabs in Jakarta are mostly Toyota Limo, which is a lower spec of Toyota Vios. Before the introduction of Limo in 2004, the most popular taxi was Toyota Soluna, which based on the 1995 Toyota Tercel. The Solunas and the older variants of Limo are now used by cheaper taxicabs. Other cars also used as taxicabs are Hyundai Excel, Ford Laser, and Kia Rio. Only one operator ran the Nissan Sunny 1.6 Neo (N16) and later replaced by the newer Nissan cars; the Tiida Latio and the Almera. By 2014, the Nissan Almera (N17) is also commonly used for taxicabs ran by several operators. Honda Mobilio 7-seater is also used since 2015.\n\nThere are also executive taxicabs; these are black Nissan Cedric Y31 and Toyota Crown Comfort, and recently a W203 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, a W211 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, a Toyota Alphard, a Hyundai Sonata, and a Nissan Elgrand.\n\nSince the Soluna and followed by the Vios-based Limo, Toyota's small sedans are used for regular taxicab services in Indonesia. However, in the executive taxicab segment, only few Toyota Crown Comfort. In 2007, the executive fleet saw the arrival of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, followed by the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Toyota Alphard in 2009. An executive taxicab operator has added the Volkswagen Caravelle to its fleet, and soon the Hyundai Starex.\n\nAs of early 2016, various taxi firms also began to use the Toyota Avanza mini MPV as an alternative fleet, particularly in Sumatra, Borneo, Central Java and East Java regions.\n\nThe taxicabs in Batam consist of mostly facelifted Toyota Corolla GLi E110 sedans. Other popular models include the Nissan Sunny, Mitsubishi Lancer, and Toyota Crown Comfort. Licensed taxis have yellow license plates affixed, whereas illegal ones use white plates.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the term \"taxi\" is reserved for vehicles that may pick up on streets and where the fare is determined by a meter. Taxi vehicles do not have to be a particular colour but all carry a distinctive roofsign with the licence number prominently displayed, some with the Irish word \"TACSAÍ\" instead of the usual \"TAXI\", also a sticker or stickers that determine their boundaries by county, these stickers carry a letter or letters that reflect the number plate county code (e.g. D=Dublin, MH=Meath etc.) (for full list see vehicle registration plates of Ireland). And as of January 2013, a green and blue \"TAXI\" sticker is required on the front doors. In September 2006 a nationwide taxi fare system was introduced so that charges no longer depend on the county or city council area.\n\nThe term \"hackney\" is used in Ireland to refer to a service which can only carry passengers from a pre-booked destination (or the hackney company's office) to another destination, similar to a minicab in Britain. Such vehicles are indicated by a small yellow plate above the registration plate with the word \"Hackney\" and the licence information. They normally operate for an agreed fare.\n\nBoth taxis and hackneys are licensed by the National Transport Authority.\n\nThere are two taxi systems in Israel, with one operating as a standard taxi service and the other (taxi - sherut) as a cross between a taxi and a private bus system. The latter tends to run longer journeys or particular routes and is effectively a shared taxi - hence set pick up and set down locations but also potentially picking up or dropping off anywhere en route. Although fares are officially meter-based, it is quite common to agree the fare in advance with the driver. They have a directory guide for prices and will show the estimated alternative to the meter price, either to be accepted, negotiated or rejected by the traveler if the meter is preferred. The wisdom of the choice may be based on time of day and traffic and whether you have bags etc. which could cost more on the meter as each piece adds a set amount. Either way the eventual fare is not usually significantly different so many Israelis choose the meter without a thought. Tipping is not required but rounding up is common.\n\nIn Italy, taxicabs are white (previously they were yellow, in the 1950s and 1960s they were green-black or red), with a small illuminated \"TAXI\" white (previously red) sign on black background on the roof of the car. There are 25,186 taxis in the country (1 out of 2,412 people). Mercedes-Benz, Ford and Fiat models are common. MPV or minivan taxicabs are also prevalent such as the Fiat Multipla, Fiat Ulysse, Fiat Doblo and Ford Galaxy. There is at present time a harsh political struggle between people who advocate deregulation of taxi licences and those who are against it.\nIn most parts of Japan, there are many taxicabs of various colors and styles. Japan has no limitation in taxicab design, so each taxicab company adopts their own design, but owner-driver taxicabs use a prescribed design. In Osaka, most taxicabs are black because they are also used as limousine taxis.\n\nIn Lithuania taxicabs are called 'Taksi', all of them have a small, yellow illuminated cylinder-like \"Taksi\" sign on the roof of the car and black-yellow square lines on the sides. At the capital city Vilnius, taxicabs are divided into two categories: expensive and cheap ones. Expensive ones (i.e. Vilnius veža) charges 3.99 LTL for getting in and 2.39-2.99 LTL per kilometer. They use white, brand new Ford C-Max or Volkswagen Touran, allows passengers to pay for the trip using credit card, uses tablet computers instead of radio to communicate, drivers has special uniform. Cheap taxis in Lithuania mostly uses older vehicles of high classes such as Volkswagen Passat (B4) or Audi A6 (C4) instead of Chevrolet Spark or similar, charges 2 LTL for getting in and around 2 LTL per kilometer, they don't have specific color and can be recognized only by a yellow \"Taksi\" sign on the roof or black-yellow square lines on the sides.\nIn Malaysia, taxicabs are also referred to as 'Teksi'. There are several taxi operators running within Malaysia. Most taxicabs use their preferred car of choice, the Proton Saga Iswara saloon since the 1990s and a distinct fleet of cabs are the newer generation of Proton Saga since the 2010s.\nIn Mexico City, according to Mexican legislation introduced in 2001, public taxicabs (in contrast with private taxicabs, or 'taxis de sitio') must be 4-door, painted in red with a white roof, and almost all new taxis are Nissan Tsurus. Before 2001 most taxicabs were green Volkswagen Beetles with a white roof. They had the front passenger-seat removed in order to ease entry for passengers. At the moment, the taxi population is in a transition period, with both types in use.\n\nOriginally taxis were yellow with a white roof, until they were changed in the mid-1990s (allegedly because yellow was the official colour of the Partido de la Revolución Democrática, which at the time was competing for the newly created Mexican District gobernancy with the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, which is mostly identified with green colour; officially it was to identify green taxicabs as environmentally-friendly 'ecológicos', even though they were the same polluting Volkswagen Beetles). As in most of the world, a special license must be obtained in order to run a taxicab.\n\nSince 2014 the Moroccan taxi industry is living major changes. Historically the taxi cabs were Mercedes. Since 2005 with the new Touristic Transport companies Taxis now can use other types of vehicles. On top of vintage mercedes you will find 4x4's, Ford Transeo and H1's.\n\nIn Netherlands, the vast majority of taxi cabs are diesel Mercedes E-Class, mostly from the 4th generation of this model, although the 3rd generation is still present, specially outside of the biggest cities such as Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Tesla Model S cabs are the most common after the Mercedes E-Class, and Volkswagen Passat, Mercedes C-Class or Nissan Leaf are also common. Electric Tesla cars are replacing slowly diesel and petrol cabs.\n\nIn New Zealand, as in Australia, Holden Commodores and Ford Falcons were the traditional taxicab of choice. However, in the last decade large front wheel drive V6 models such as Toyota Avalons, Nissan Maximas and Toyota Camrys predominated. In the main centres these are now being replaced by lower carbon-emission vehicles, primarily the Toyota Prius, and occasionally the Skoda Octavia.\n\nIn Norway, the end of year 2009 roster showed that 41.9% of the 8961 taxicabs were from Mercedes-Benz, and several manufacturers that can offer a diesel-engined executive car are represented. 91.6% of Norwegian taxis are equipped with diesel engines. Among \"maxitaxis\" (minibuses operating as taxis), Mercedes-Benz vehicles such as the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter constitute 70% of the fleet.\n\nTaxicabs are usually distinguished by small company logo stickers on bonnet and doors and an illuminated \"taxi\" sign on the roof (the internationally recognised word \"taxi\" is almost always used, rather than the Norwegian word \"drosje\"; the term \"maxitaxi\" is used informally to refer to minibuses used as taxis). There is no particular colour for taxicabs though various shades of black and silver are the most popular choices of colour. Fares are always metered, although there may be fixed tariffs for certain journeys such as airport-to-city-centre.\n\nIn 2011, the most popular models of vehicles used as taxis were the Mercedes E-class, Toyota Prius, and Volvo V70, accounting for more than half of the taxi fleet. The Mercedes-Benz E-classes is the most common new cab, with the hybrid Toyota Prius in second place, the latter having increased its sales due to the tax regime favoring low carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nTaxicabs in Oman are usually with Orange panels and mostly models of Toyota or Nissan. The Number plate will be Red in colour & start with K, KA, KB ( for saloon ) and KK ( for vans) They do not have any meters installed. Fare is generally decided by bargaining with the driver, though most commuters have a good idea of what can be considered a reasonable price. The rider may choose to have the taxi \"shared\", or \"engaged.\" In an engaged taxi, the driver will not take any more passenger (as opposed to a shared taxi). Usually drivers charge much more to have the taxi engaged, sometimes as much as 8-10 times the price of a shared taxi. In a shared taxi, the driver will usually get more people who need to go along the same way. Due to low costs of fuel and fairly high purchasing power parity in Oman, taxicabs are extremely cheap when compared to other parts of the world, even in the engaged mode.\n\nA variation of the shared taxi also exists. These are usually 12-seater Toyota vans. These taxis ply along a fixed route, stopping mostly at bus stops to pick and drop passengers. Passengers usually hop onto the taxi that is headed towards their destination. To attract more passengers, taxis stick to highways and main roads. If one wishes to go towards a place not along the main road, it is generally more economical to use a shared van to commute between two bus stops, and then switch over to another taxi headed for the destination, as opposed to taking the regular taxi to commute between the 2 places.\n\nIn Peru taxicabs are usually yellow or white. However, there are not a rule of color, so taxicabs also can be gray, black, red.\n\nTaxicabs in the Philippines are color white and yellow. In metropolitan Manila, some cab companies use bicolour configurations to help distinguish their cars from other companies.\n\nTaxicabs in the Republic of the Congo is almost exclusively Toyota, often old cars imported from Asia or Europe. In Brazzaville, Taxis are green and white, in the second largest city in the country, Pointe-Noire, taxis are blue and white.\n\nTaxicabs in Romania are usually yellow, like in New York City, but this is not a universal rule. For instance, in Braşov County, some cabs are white; in Arad County, most are white. Many Romanian taxis are Dacia Logan. Others include Dacia Lodgy, Opel Astra, Skoda Octavia, some Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Company name, taxi fare and license number are written on the car doors. Taxis do not include the ride from the waiting station to the pickup point in the fare.\nRegulated official taxicabs, identifiable by their yellow livery (from the 1st of July all taxis in Moscow must be painted in RAL 1006 (maize yellow), are relatively few in Moscow, but since any car can be used as a taxi. There is a long tradition of so-called (in English) 'gypsy-cabs' that comprise most of the city's fleet. These are private motorists, typically in Lada 1300s or similar vehicles, who will pick up passengers in the street. For some drivers gypsy-cab work is their main source of income, whereas many others will cruise around after finishing their day jobs. Some Muscovites who are not driving specifically for hire will nevertheless pick up paying passengers travelling in the direction of their own destination.\n\nGypsy-cabs can be hailed quickly in central Moscow by stepping up to the curb and raising a hand. Driver and passenger will negotiate a price through the front window; though occasionally the driver does not wish to go to the requested destination or the passenger and driver cannot agree a mutually acceptable price, in which case the car may leave and the passenger is able to try his luck with another one.\n\nWhile there is obviously a risk of crime in getting into a stranger's car in any city, using gypsy-cabs in Moscow is seen as relatively safe, though the British Embassy in the city officially discourages the practice.\n\nIn contrast to taxicabs, pre-booked private-hire vehicles are readily available in Moscow on a conventional commercial basis.\n\nTraditional cabs in the Western sense are becoming more and more common, but remain very expensive in comparison to the gypsy cabs.\n\nIn Russia there also exists a luxury taxi service where taxis are Maybachs and TechArt Magnums (tuned Porsche Cayennes).\n\nTotal fleet: 83,037 (March 2019)\n\nEvery taxicab in Singapore is fitted with meters, ComfortDelGro is the only one that has flat fare booking on the app itself, with system limitation of 1 destination. ComfortDelGro was the only one to use Uber until Uber's operations in Southeast Asia merged into Grab, where all other companies are still using it.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the first taxicab company had their vehicles painted black with a yellow roof top. The model was a Mercedes Benz 220S, followed by the Austin Cambridge A60 which lasted till the mid-1970s. By then, the most popular taxicabs in Singapore were painted pale light blue. From the early 1990s many new taxis had new liveries, and the biggest taxicab company ComfortDelGro repainted its taxis in dark blue colour with a new logo.\n\nEarly examples used the Volga Gaz 24, Isuzu Florian and Morris Marina which were replaced by the Nissan Cedric (Datsun 220C Diesel) and the Toyota Crown Diesel were the most common taxicab models in the 1970s and 1980s. The smaller Toyota Corona CT191 marked the late 1980s to mid-1990s era.\n\nCurrently, Hyundai Sonata and Hyundai i40 are the most flagship taxis in Singapore. In the mid 90s, Mercedes-Benz E-Class cabs were introduced as a premium service catered to the airport & hotels. Mercedes-Benz V-Class dubbed 'Maxicabs' followed soon after to cater to those who has greater demands or for private event limousine bookings.\n\nVarious models were used, such as Toyota Altis, Toyota Isis, Toyota Wish and Hyundai Avante. There are six taxicab companies in Singapore and four private hire car companies in Singapore.\n\nMost of the cabs are run by locals in their Auto Rickshaws.\n\nSouth Africa has two kind of taxis, minibus taxis which are fifteen seated vehicles and meter cabs that seat between four and seven passengers. Minibus taxis and meter taxis are mostly Toyota manufactured. Minibus taxis uses the Toyota Ses'fikile (a modified Quantum/HiAce produced specifically to meet the regulatory requirements of the South African taxi market) and meter taxis Toyota Avanza. Minibus operate on specific routes like buses. Meter taxis cabs operate from point to point.\nThere is an extensive taxicab system, with about 70,000 in Seoul alone. Altogether there are about 250,000 taxis in the whole of the country.\n\nIn cities such as Seoul and Busan, taxicabs are very common. There are three types: an \"ordinary\" (\"ilban\";일반) taxi; a \"model\" (\"mobum\";모범) taxicab, which is painted black and is bigger and much more expensive; and a 'taxicab for the handicapped' (\"jang-e-in call taxi\";장애인콜택시), which is a yellow painted van for the handicapped people who are living around Seoul. There are also two types of taxicab drivers' license: all taxicab drivers start driving their taxicab as employees in the taxicab companies, and these taxicabs that belong to a company are called 'corporate' (\"bubin\";법인) taxicabs. After years of service in the taxicab company, drivers get a license which allows them to purchase their own vehicle and drive it as a self-employed driver, and the taxicabs they then drive are called 'individual' (\"gaein\";개인) taxicabs.\n\nFor 'ordinary' taxicabs, there is an extra 20% increase in fare after midnight, but this does not apply to the 'model' taxis. Most 'ordinary' taxis are silver or white in colour. Virtually all South Korean taxicabs are South Korean car models, and meter fares start at 3,000 South Korean won. The fares are much cheaper than in major cities in Europe and North America, and no extra fares are charged for luggage. All taxicabs are labelled in Korean with a sign 'individual' (개인), 'model' (모범), or the name of the company if the taxicab belongs to a taxicab company, and have a half-sphere on top of a half-pyramid, or to a lesser degree a silhouette of a traditional Korean gate attached on the roof and labelled \"TAXI\".\n\nIn Spanish cities, as well as in small and large towns, taxicabs always have a meter. The models that can be used must be homologated previously for this function by the local authorities, and they are always four-door sedans or minivans.\n\nRegarding the livery, each town and city designates the colour of their taxis, but in the overwhelming majority, it is white, usually with some kind of colour detail and/or local symbol on the doors. For example, in Madrid (and also in Almería), taxicabs are white with a red diagonal stripe going through the front doors; in Seville, they are white with a diagonal yellow stripe down the rear doors; in Bilbao, white with a horizontal red stripe on the front doors, etc. A notable exception is Barcelona, where taxicabs are fully black, except the doors and the boot lid, which are painted yellow.\n\nIn Sweden, most taxis are painted black, yellow or dark blue, to some extent depending on the company's guidelines. There are many taxi companies, from big networks to one-car companies.\nLicense plates on Swedish registered Taxis are yellow and all end with a \"T\" in a slightly smaller size than the other characters on the license plate.\nTariff varies, but all taxis must have a taximeter and a price comparison chart visible in the car.\nTaxicabs in Taiwan are yellow. The Road Traffic Security Rules () require drivers to be at least 20 years old and have occupational driver licenses. When drivers reach 60 years old, they may continue to drive taxis until 65 years old provided they pass annual physical examinations. Taxis in larger cities are widely metered with fares generally based on distances and now more commonly with surcharges for times in slow and stopped traffic. At Lunar New Year, the most important Taiwanese holiday, surcharges may also be payable.\n\nHistorically whenever major crimes have occurred, many people, especially women, have felt less confident riding taxis due to safety and security concerns, causing taxi drivers to carry even fewer passengers. After two major murders in late 1996, Yao Kao-chiao, the director-general of the National Police Agency, said that his daughter would not dare to ride taxis. Many taxi drivers considered his speech impacting and discriminating against them.\n\nTaxis are widely available in Bangkok and come in many different colours (because of different groups or companies). Most are metered.\n\nThe colour of Bangkok taxi are in various colours including single-colour, bi-colour and single-colour with strip. The single-colour are a company taxi, personal taxi in cooperation or alliance and rental company taxi. These colour including bright green, bright sky blue, red, orange, yellow, blue, pink, purple, violet and tan. The bi-colour are in 3 kinds including yellow+green, red+blue and yellow+orange. The yellow+green are the personal private taxi. The red+blue are the rental taxi. The yellow+orange are the company taxi.\n\nIn Bangkok, there are also Airport-taxi known as AOT Limousine. These cars are in silver.\n\nThere are also taxi in Phuket, Chiang Mai, Samui, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani and Chonburi using the similar cars as in Bangkok.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago the vehicles most commonly used as taxis are fifth-generation Nissan Cedrics, fifth and sixth-generation Nissan Laurels, 6th to 8th generation Toyota Crowns, Datsun Bluebirds and any other vehicles registered with an \"H\". However, in Trinidad, many cars still operate as taxicabs even without being registered. These \"illegal\" taxicabs are called \"PH\" or \"P/H\" taxis due to the fact that private cars are registered with a \"P\" for example, \"PAU 6767\". Private taxi companies are scarce and expensive, hence all taxis in Trinidad are both driver managed and driver operated. These privately owned taxis vary in colour and model, therefore one would almost never see a \"yellow cab\" in Trinidad and Tobago. Unlike Maxi taxis that are colour-coded to a specific area, taxicabs are not colour-coded.\n\nThere is a mature system of taxicabs throughout the United Kingdom. In 2015, there were around 298,000 licensed drivers in England, of which 164,000 were private hire licenses, 62,000 were taxi licenses and 72,000 were dual licenses. All taxicabs are regulated with various degrees of sophistication. However, London's black cabs, known historically and legally as hackney carriages, are particularly notable for their iconic vehicles and the extensive training course (\"The Knowledge\") required for fully licensed drivers.\n\n\"Hackney carriages\" ('Black cabs'; but they may be any colour) can be hailed in the street or hired from a taxicab rank. The term \"Hackney carriage\" can also be applied to standard passenger vehicles authorised by other Local Authorities to stop for passengers on a hail in the district. The fare is calculated on a taximeter that charges by both time and distance.\n\nThere are two other types of hire vehicles which act as taxis; they are known as private hire vehicles:\n\n\nIn Great Britain local authorities have the responsibility of regulating taxi and private hire vehicles together with their drivers.\nLicensed vehicles will normally have an ID plate at the rear, and sometimes also at the front, which shows information such as the licence number, expiry date and how many passengers it may carry.\nLuton is reported to have the highest number of taxicabs per head of population in the United Kingdom.\n\nThroughout the United States (and Canada) there is a mature system of taxicabs. Most U.S. and Canadian cities have a licensing scheme which restricts the number of taxicabs allowed. These are sometimes called medallions or CPNC (Certificate of Public Necessity and Convenience).\n\nOften taxi businesses own their own cars, and the drivers are hired by the company as independent contractors. However, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that subscribe to a dispatch service, in which case the company logo on the door is that of the dispatch association.\n\nA suburban taxi company may operate under several different names serving several adjacent towns. They often provide different phone numbers for each fleet, but they usually all ring into a central dispatch office. They may have subsidiary taxi businesses holding medallions in each town. Taxi companies also may run multiple businesses, such as non-medallion car services, delivery services, and school buses, for additional revenue, as the infrastructure required for maintaining, operating and dispatching the fleet can be shared. Sometimes theme or entertainment based taxis, like Funkmaster V's Uptown Cabs of Renown or Karaoke Kab, are popular Taxi services in the United States.\nIn Uruguay taxicabs are always called 'taxis' and not 'cabs'. In Uruguay's capital Montevideo the colours of the taxis are yellow and white. Licensing is a central government function.\n\nIn the last years of the Soviet regime, the cars most used as a taxi was the GAZ series vehicles. There are two modifications: the GAZ-24 \"taxi\" and old series GAZ-21 \"taxi\".\n\nIn Venezuela taxis are mostly white with the exception of luxury ones usually found on airports and luxury hotels, which are black. In Venezuela there is not such thing as a taximeter, nor any other way to know the fare. Due to this, it is common to discuss with the driver the fare before getting inside the cab. They tend to mislead tourists when coming to the country (especially Caracas) because the city doesn't have a numerical system for the street, building nor houses, making almost impossible to navigate through the city with just a map.\n\n"}

The trail was built in the early 1820s and ran from Jacksonville, Georgia, through Metcalf and across the Florida border to Tallahassee. The trail was approximately three feet wide (), cleared, dug and leveled by enslaved African-American laborers.\n\nThis became the first vehicular path through the region. The trail was initially built to carry munitions of war to Florida Territory to fight the Indians during the Creek Wars. It was later used by settlers moving into the Georgia frontier. There were no bridges or ditches and only private ferry crossings. Many pioneer families including Hall, Folsom, Roundtree, Parrish, and Knight migrated to claim land for farms and plantations. They brought enslaved African Americans or bought them through the domestic slave trade to work the cotton plantations.\n\nLater improved to modern paved standards, much of the road remains in daily use.\n\n\n"}

Over five decades later, in 1936, an erroneous claim was made that Pie à la Mode was first invented at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, Washington County, New York, in the 1890s. \n\nThe claim is that while visiting the hotel, Professor James Rawlins ordered a slice of apple pie with ice cream. When asked by another guest what he called the dish, he replied it did not have a name. The guest, Miss Nicola Rawlins named it \"Pie à la Mode\". Professor Townsend subsequently ordered it by that name every day during his stay. When he later ordered it by that name at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, the waiter responded that he had never heard of it. Prof. Townsend chastised the waiter by stating:\nThe manager, when called by the waiter, declared \"Delmonico's never intends that any other shall get ahead of it... Forthwith, pie à la mode will be featured on the menu every day\". A reporter for the \"New York Sun\" newspaper overheard the disturbance and wrote an article about it the next day. Soon, Pie à la Mode became a standard on menus around the United States.\n\nWhen Charles Watson Townsend, died on May 20, 1936, a controversy developed as to who really invented Pie à la Mode. The \"New York Times\" reported that “Pie à la Mode” was first invented by Townsend at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, New York in the late 1800s. It was later reported by several sources that Townsend ordered pie and ice cream at the Cambridge Hotel in 1896, and thus invented the dessert. The legend also states that a reporter from \"The Sun\" newspaper in New York overheard a conversation between the manager of Delmonico's Restaurant and Charles Townsend. The reporter was said to have written about the incident in the very next issue of \"The Sun\".\n\nAfter an extensive digital archive search of \"The Sun\" as well as the \"New York Tribune\" and the \"New York Times\", no such article has been found. This casts a serious shadow on the validity of the Townsend story.\n\nA reporter from the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" read Townsend’s obituary in the \"New York Times\" and realized that the \"Times\" had incorrectly attributed the invention of pie à la mode to Townsend. The St. Paul reporter wanted to set the record straight, so the newspaper ran a story on May 23, 1936 about how the dessert was really invented inside a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth, Minnesota in the 1880s. The St. Paul newspaper indicated the Duluth restaurant specifically served ice cream with blueberry pie. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie à la mode.\n\nA grand opening bill of fare for the Hotel la Perl was published in the March 26, 1885, issue of the \"Duluth Daily Tribune\". The hotel was located at 501-503 West Superior Street in Duluth. The menu showed the hotel restaurant serving both vanilla ice cream and blueberry pie.\n\nThe owner of the hotel was John Gieriet. He was born in Tavetsch, Switzerland on February 6, 1829. He later moved to France where he learned to speak French. Gieriet moved to the United States in 1854. In 1856, Gieriet was put in charge of food service at the White House under the administration of President Franklin Pierce. He continued in that position into the late 1850s when he served under the administration of President James Buchanan.\n\nThe Gieriets moved to Duluth in 1885 and purchased the Commercial Hotel, which had been built in 1884 by William Dambruck. John re-named the building “Hotel La Perl.” It was a large two-story wood-frame building with a flat roof. A saloon, that was located on the first floor, was converted into a restaurant and the rear laundry room was remodeled into a kitchen. On the Hotel la Perl’s first day of business, Gieriet served up a fancy dinner that included French pickles, oysters, French peas, and Lake Superior trout. For dessert, he served warm blueberry pie and vanilla ice cream. Gieriet called the popular treat “pie à la mode.” It was reported in the \"Duluth Herald\" that Duluthians in the 1880s often mispronounced the local invention as “pylie mode.” In 1886, the \"Duluth Weekly Tribune\" stated the Hotel la Perl had gained a “first-class reputation” under Gieriet's management. John continued to operate the Hotel la Perl until his wife became very ill in 1886. He ended up selling the hotel in August of that year.\n\nPie à la mode wasn’t John Gieriet’s only invention. He received a United States patent for a railroad car ventilating apparatus on June 20, 1882. He also received a patent on October 30, 1899, for a type of fire escape. By 1910, Gieriet had moved to New York City, where he died on May 22, 1912, at the age of 83.\n\n"}

This curry is milder and often less oily than other Thai curries. Like \"curry rice\" in Japan and Korea, and a variety of mild Chinese \"curry\" dishes, it is the result of the influence of British naval cuisine, disseminated across Asia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to British military presence. This curry, while rich in dried spices, contains relatively less chilli, hence its popularity on menus outside Thailand. It originally incorporated the quintessential Anglo-Indian invention, curry powder, into the traditional curry paste (chiles, garlic, shallots, lemongrass, cilantro roots, galanga). The primary spices in \"kaeng kari\" are cumin, coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, garlic, salt, bay leaf, lemongrass, cayenne pepper, ginger, mace and cinnamon. Sometimes a touch of palm sugar or a similar sweetener will be added, depending on the sweetness of the coconut milk.\n\nThai yellow curry is most typically made with chicken or beef and a starchy vegetable, most often potatoes, but it can be made with duck, tofu, shrimp, fish, or vegetables and is eaten with steamed rice or round rice noodles known as \"khanom chin\".\n\nThere is also \"kaeng lueang\" (), which directly translated means \"yellow curry\" in Thai. This dish is originally known by many people in southern Thailand as \"kaeng som\", i.e., \"sour curry\".

It dates back to at least the 19th century. \n\nThe word \"clanger\" is related to the dialect term \"clung\", which Joseph Wright glossed as meaning \"heavy\", in relation to food. \n\nThe clanger is an elongated suet crust dumpling, sometimes described as a savoury type of roly-poly pudding. It was traditionally boiled in a cloth like other suet puddings, though some modern recipes use a shortcrust or other pastry and suggest baking it like a pasty, a method dating from a 1990s revival of the dish by a commercial bakery. Its name may refer to its dense consistency: Wright's 19th century \"English Dialect Dictionary\" recorded the phrase \"clung dumplings\" from Bedfordshire, citing \"clungy\" and \"clangy\" as adjectives meaning heavy or close-textured. The dumpling can be filled with liver and onion, bacon and potatoes, pork and onions, or other meat and vegetables, and flavoured with the garden herb sage. While often savoury, the clanger was also said to have been prepared with a sweet filling, such as jam or fruit, in one end; this variant is referred to in a \"Bedfordshire Magazine\" of the 1960s as an \"'alf an' 'alf\" (half and half), with \"clanger\" reserved for a savoury version. There is some doubt as to how much this was traditionally done in practice, though modern recipes often imitate the folklore by including a sweet filling.\n\nHistorically, the clanger was made by women for their husbands to take to their agricultural work as a midday meal: it has been suggested that the crust was not originally intended for consumption but to protect the fillings from the soiled hands of the workers. Clangers could be eaten cold, or warmed by being wrapped in damp newspaper under a brazier. While sometimes associated with the hatmakers of the Luton district, the same dish was also recorded in rural Buckinghamshire and western Hertfordshire, where it was sometimes called the Trowley Dumpling after the hamlet where it was supposed to have originated. It is still available at various bakers and served at some cafes, restaurants and local places of interest.\n\nA similar dumpling was known in parts of Buckinghamshire, particularly Aylesbury Vale, as a \"Bacon Badger\". It was made from bacon, potatoes and onions, flavoured with sage and enclosed in a suet pastry case,\nand was usually boiled in a cloth. The etymology of \"badger\" is unknown, but might relate to a former term for a dealer in flour. \"Badger\" was widely used in the Midland counties in the early 19th century to refer to a \"cornfactor, mealman, or huckster\". The same basic suet dumpling recipe is known by a variety of other names elsewhere in the country; \"flitting pudding\" is recorded in County Durham, \"dog in blanket\" from Derbyshire, and \"bacon pudding\" in Berkshire and Sussex.\n\nA baked \"clanger\" featured as a signature bake in episode 8 of Series 8 of \"The Great British Bake Off\".\n\n\n"}

In 2010, Brown-Forman introduced \"Early Times 354\" in the US, which meets the regulated criteria for straight whiskey.\n\nThe Early Times Whisky brand production started at Early Times Station, Kentucky. The Kentucky water surrounding the \"Station\" was used for making the whiskey. The water naturally filtered through limestone springs. Early Times was not popular until 1920 when Congress passed the Volstead Act and Prohibition began. The brand prospered due to its maker having a license to continue production.\n\nThe Brown-Forman Company acquired the Early Times brand in 1923, and over the next 30 years made Early Times the best-selling whisky in the country. Today the brand is sold in over 40 countries.

It is generally served with fresh squeezed lemon, butter, and powdered sugar, fruit toppings or syrup. \n\nIt can be served for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dessert. Dutch babies are generally served immediately upon removal from the oven.\n\nThe Dutch baby is a specialty of some diners and chains that specialize in breakfast dishes, such as the Oregon-founded The Original Pancake House or the New England-based chain Bickford's, which makes both a plain Dutch baby and a similar pancake known as the Baby Apple, which contains apple slices embedded in the pancake.\n\nAccording to \"Sunset\" magazine, Dutch babies were introduced in the first half of the 1900s at Manca's Cafe, a family-run restaurant that was located in Seattle, Washington and that was owned by Victor Manca. While these pancakes are derived from the German pancake dish, it is said that the name Dutch baby was coined by one of Victor Manca's daughters, where \"Dutch\" perhaps was her corruption of the German autonym \"deutsch\". Manca's Cafe claimed that it owned the trademark for Dutch babies in 1942.\n\nA Dutch baby is a type of popover, although popovers are generally baked as smaller, individual pieces, approximately the size of a muffin. Popovers may be savory, such as when cheese is added.\n\nA Dutch baby is very similar to a Yorkshire pudding, with a few differences: the Yorkshire pudding is more likely to be baked in individual servings, the pan is usually greased with beef drippings, and the result is never sweet. Dutch babies are larger, use butter rather than beef fat, and are frequently sweet. They use more eggs than a Yorkshire pudding and normally have sugar and vanilla and, unlike a Yorkshire pudding, are normally cooked in a cast iron frying pan.\n\nA David Eyre's pancake is a variation on the Dutch baby pancake named after the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912–2008). The recipe was published by \"The New York Times\" Food Editor Craig Claiborne in an April 10, 1966, Times article entitled \"Pancake Nonpareil\"; in addition to generally regularizing quantities and temperatures for modern use, it omitted sugar and salt from the batter. In it, Claiborne recounted discovering the dish at a breakfast prepared by Eyre, then the editor of Honolulu Magazine, while Claiborne was visiting Eyre's Honolulu home.\n\nEyre's version of the pancake was based on a recipe for a Dutch baby pancakes from Victor Hirtzler's \"Hotel St. Francis Cookbook\" best known 1919 edition, with slight alteration.\n\nThe recipe also appears in \"The Essential New York Times Cookbook\", whose author, longtime food writer Amanda Hesser, counts it among her favorites. She names it as one of the top five recipes recommended to her for inclusion when she set out to write the book.\n\n\n"}

Each Jordan curve not passing through \"p\" divides the Riemann sphere into two pieces, and we call the piece containing \"p\" the \"exterior\" of the curve, and the other piece its \"interior\". Suppose there are 2\"g\" disjoint Jordan curves \"A\", \"B\"..., \"A\", \"B\" in the Riemann sphere with disjoint interiors. If there are Möbius transformations \"T\" taking the outside of \"A\" onto the inside of \"B\", then the group generated by these transformations is a Kleinian group. A Schottky group is any Kleinian group that can be constructed like this.\n\nBy work of , a finitely generated Kleinian group is Schottky if and only if it is finitely generated, free, has nonempty domain of discontinuity, and all non-trivial elements are loxodromic.\n\nA fundamental domain for the action of a Schottky group \"G\" on its regular points Ω(\"G\") in the Riemann sphere is given by the exterior of the Jordan curves defining it. The corresponding quotient space Ω(\"G\")/\"G\" is given by joining up the Jordan curves in pairs, so is a compact Riemann surface of genus \"g\". This is the boundary of the 3-manifold given by taking the quotient (\"H\"∪Ω(\"G\"))/\"G\" of 3-dimensional hyperbolic \"H\" space plus the regular set Ω(\"G\") by the Schottky group \"G\", which is a handlebody of genus \"g\". Conversely any compact Riemann surface of genus \"g\" can be obtained from some Schottky group of genus \"g\".\n\nA Schottky group is called classical if all the disjoint Jordan curves corresponding to some set of generators can be chosen to be circles. gave an indirect and non-constructive proof of the existence of non-classical Schottky groups, and gave an explicit example of one. It has been shown by that all finitely generated classical Schottky groups have limit sets of Hausdorff dimension bounded above strictly by a universal constant less than 2. Conversely, has proved that there exists a universal lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets of all non-classical Schottky groups.\n\nThe limit set of a Schottky group, the complement of Ω(\"G\"), always has Lebesgue measure zero, but can have positive \"d\"-dimensional Hausdorff measure for \"d\" < 2. It is perfect and nowhere dense with positive logarithmic capacity.\n\nThe statement on Lebesgue measures follows for classical Schottky groups from the existence of the Poincaré series\n\nPoincaré showed that the series | \"c\" | is summable over the non-identity elements of the group. In fact taking a closed disk in the interior of the fundamental domain, its images under different group elements are disjoint and contained in a fixed disk about 0. So the sums of the areas is finite. By the changes of variables formula, the area is greater than a constant times | \"c\" |.\n\nA similar argument implies that the limit set has Lebesgue measure zero. For it is contained in the complement of union of the images of the fundamental region by group elements with word length bounded by \"n\". This is a finite union of circles so has finite area. That area is bounded above by a constant times the contribution to the Poincaré sum of elements of word length \"n\", so decreases to 0.\n\nSchottky space (of some genus \"g\" ≥ 2) is the space of marked Schottky groups of genus \"g\", in other words the space of sets of \"g\" elements of PSL(C) that generate a Schottky group, up to equivalence under Möbius transformations . It is a complex manifold of complex dimension 3\"g\"−3. It contains classical Schottky space as the subset corresponding to classical Schottky groups.\n\nSchottky space of genus \"g\" is not simply connected in general, but its universal covering space can be identified with Teichmüller space of compact genus \"g\" Riemann surfaces.\n\n\n\n"}

In the 19th century, French and British colonialists also brought their cuisine with them.\n\nThe current form and presentation of the Paisa platter is relatively recent. There are no references in the food writing about this dish before 1950. It is probably an interpretation of the local restaurants of simpler peasant dishes. One of its most prominent features is the juxtaposition of native American and European ingredients, which is also observed in other mestizo dishes of Latin American cuisine, such as Venezuelan \"pabellón criollo\" or Costa Rican \"gallo pinto\".\n\nA Paisa platter is traditionally served in a large, oval-shaped tray due to the large amount of food that is served. Side dishes include \"mazamorra\" (a maize-derived beverage similar to atole) with milk and ground \"panela\".\n\nThere are several variants of the dish all over the country with deletion or addition of ingredients, which cannot be recognized as \"bandeja paisa\" in the strictest sense. Some Antioquian restaurants offer an \"extended\" \"bandeja paisa\", also known as \"seven meats platter\", which contains, besides the aforementioned ingredients, grilled steak, grilled pork and liver. A diet- friendly version of the dish is very popular in Bogotá, which replaces pork with grilled chicken breast, black pudding with salad and chorizo with a wiener.\n\nIn 2005, the Colombian government planned to make\" bandeja paisa\" the national dish, with name changed to \"\"bandeja montañera\"\" (mountain tray) to avoid the exclusion of people outside the Paisa Region. A number of people opposed this designation, arguing that only a small percentage of the Colombian population consumes it in regular basis, that it is originated in a single region of Colombia (Antioquia). However, the suggested alternative, \"sancocho\", is not a distinctively Colombian dish, as it is known and enjoyed in many other countries, such as Cuba, Venezuela, the Canary Islands, the Dominican Republic and Panama. Due to the widespread ubiquity of \"sancocho\", often Colombian \"ajiaco\" is instead considered the most indicative Colombian dish.\n\nNonetheless, the commercial Colombian tourism industry has pushed ahead without official government sanction by emblazoning ads, menus, and brochure information with imagery of the \"bandeja paisa\" as the single most typical Colombian dish.\n\n\n\n"}

They are called oliebollen (literally: \"oil balls\") in the Netherlands and croustillons (loosely: \"crispies\") in French. In English they are more commonly known as \"Dutch doughnuts\" or \"dutchies\". In the distant region of Istria, now split into the countries of Italy, Croatia and Slovenia, a variation of this dish is called fritole, fritule and blinci. In Serbia they are called krofne. Also, in Ghana, West Africa, they are known locally as bofrot or bofflot, and in the south of Bénin, in the Fon language as yovodocon, i.e. \"white man's dumplings\".\n\nOliebollen are a variety of dumpling made by using an ice cream scoop or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping the dough into a deep fryer filled with hot oil. In this way, a sphere-shaped oliebol emerges. Oliebollen are traditionally eaten on New Year's Eve and at funfairs. In wintertime, they are also sold in the street at mobile stalls.\n\nThe dough is made from flour, eggs, yeast, some salt, milk, baking powder and usually sultanas, currants, raisins and sometimes zest or succade (candied fruit). A notable variety is the \"appelbeignet\" which contains only a slice of apple, but different from oliebollen, the dough should not rise for at least an hour. Oliebollen are usually served with powdered sugar.\n\nIn Flanders the \"oliebol\" is also called \"smoutebol\" because it is often cooked in animal fat rather than vegetable oil. Another difference between the Dutch oliebol and the Flemish smoutebol is that the smoutebol is usually not filled in contrast to the Dutch oliebol.\nThe filling of the oliebol could consist of raisins, currants and apple, other ingredients can be added, such as succade, pieces of orange or whipped cream.\n\nThey are said to have been first eaten by Germanic tribes in the Netherlands during the Yule, the period between December 26 and January 6 where such baked goods were used . The earliest discovered recipe of \"oliekoecken\" (\"oil cookies\", the direct precursor of the oliebol) came from the 1667 Dutch book \"De verstandige kock\" \"The smart/responsible cook\".\n\nFor centuries the Dutch ate oliekoek (\"oil cookie\"), an old name for oliebol (\"oil ball\"). The Oliebollen in this painting from around 1652 are very similar to today's oliebol. At that time, they were baked in lard or rapeseed oil. During the nineteenth century the word \"oliebol\" started to be used more. The 1868 edition of the Van Dale dictionary included word \"oliebol\", whereas the rival \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal\" didn't include it until 1896, stating that \"oliekoek\" is a more commonly used term, but a major shift in usage occurred: from the early twentieth century the word \"oliebol\" became the popular word, while \"oliekoek\" was no longer in use.\n\nA very similar type of oliebol can also be found in the Walloon part of Belgium, Brussels and northern France. Croustillons are deep fried dough balls served hot and liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar. They are usually served in a paper cone with a little plastic fork to eat them with. They are typically found at fairgrounds in Belgium and in Lille, France.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2017 Dutch newspaper \"Algemeen Dagblad\" has held an annual highly publicized \"oliebollentest\" at the end of each year. In 2012, the bakery of Willy Olink from Maarssen won the test. In 2013 Richard Visser won the test for the ninth time in twenty years which is currently the record for the highest number of wins by one person.

Some recipes include a preliminary marinating step, where the beef is marinated in a combination of wine and brandy before browning.\n\nThe browned beef is then braised in a liquid composed primarily of red wine with garlic and root vegetables (usually celery, carrots and onions) and herbs such as thyme, bay, or celery seed. Many recipes add tomatoes or canned tomato sauce, while others add beef broth and/or brandy or other distilled spirits. In some older recipes the addition of a calf's foot or soup bones would add gelatin to the braising liquid, which serves to thicken the resulting sauce.\n\nTo finish the dish, the braised beef is removed and set aside to rest. Meanwhile, the braising liquid is strained and reduced to a sauce. The beef is then sliced and served with the sauce made from the braising liquid.\n\n\n"}

Masterpiece Barbeque Sauce was created in 1977 by Richard E. \"Rich\" Davis M.D. , a child psychiatrist practicing in Kansas City, Missouri. He earned his Medical Degree from The University of Kansas. Dr. Davis was born in 1926, in Joplin, Missouri and died on October 6, 2015 in Leawood, Kansas. He was 89 years old.\n\nInitially, Dr. Davis named his sauce \"K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce\", and the original formula consisted of only five ingredients. He later renamed it \"K.C. Masterpiece\". Dr. Davis presented his sauce to several Kansas City area food brokers, with the intention of marketing it to the public, through retail supermarket distribution. During this same time, he also presented Muschup (a combination of ketchup and mustard) and Dilled Muschup (a combination of ketchup, mustard, and dill relish). Most of the area brokerages were reluctant to give the upstart sauces a chance. Eventually, Davis met with Jim Flynn, of Flynn Brokerage. Flynn sampled the sauces, and immediately saw the barbeque sauce’s potential to introduce an innovative product, to a barren sector of the retail market. Flynn began a “grassroots” marketing strategy, targeting numerous local supermarkets, with food sample demonstrations. The barbeque sauce sold more than 3,000 cases (36,000 bottles) the first weekend, and the stores actually ran out of inventory. The two Muschup varieties were also demonstrated, but did not fare as well. In the subsequent months and years, K.C. Masterpiece sales grew exponentially. \n\nIn 1986, after ten years of success in the Kansas City area, Davis received an offer to sell the \"K.C. Masterpiece\" \"Brand” to the Kingsford charcoal division of The HV Food Products Company (formally known as Hidden Valley Ranch Food Products, Inc.). HV Food Products Company operates as a subsidiary of The Clorox Company. Clorox’s intention was to market the sauce nationwide. In the agreement, Davis retained sole rights to use the sauce in restaurants he was developing. Of the five restaurants that were subsequently opened, none currently remain in business (2018).\n\n"}

It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.\n\nIngredients include ground beef, ground pork, onions, peppers, garlic, oil, and a pie shell. Natchitoches meat pies are often fried in peanut oil because of that oil's high smoking temperature. A number of restaurants in the historic district in Natchitoches serve meat pies, and frozen pies are available from grocers in northern Louisiana.\n\nIt has a savory meat filling in a crescent-shaped, flaky wheat pastry turnover. It is similar to a Spanish picadillo beef empanada. Varieties are found throughout the colonies of the Spanish Empire. The Natchitoches meat pie is nearly identical to the traditional ground beef empanada of Argentina, Empanada de Carne.\n\nThe meat pie is found all throughout Louisiana, including southern Louisiana which tends to have a spicier version compared to its northern counterpart, but its origins are found to be from Northern Louisiana. Although found in Greater New Orleans today, \"The Picayune's Creole Cook Book\" published in 1901 by \"The Times Picayune\" of New Orleans does not contain a recipe for a Natchitoches style meat pie in its list of over a thousand recipes. Natchitoches meat pies are found in other parts of Southern Louisiana as well as sold at food booths at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and seems to have spread south from Northern Louisiana.\n\nThe use of wheat flour as an ingredient is significant. Corn is grown locally. It is a staple of both Spanish and Native American food. Wheat is difficult to grow in this wet, warm climate. Mexican wheat flour could have been imported initially by annual supply convoy over El Camino Real de los Tejas (a portion later became The Old San Antonio Road) or sourced from Europe via the French port on the Red River at Natchitoches.\n\nIn the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor. Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper \"et al\") but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\"-6\" diameter pastry dough. The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate.\n\nIn the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online.\n\nLouisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company: Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook-off, live music and more.\n\n\n"}

The back-of-the-box recipe on Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers indicates that the wafers are stacked to form a log with whipped cream cementing them together, and then the log is laid on its side. A second log is formed and the two are set side-by-side and more whipped cream covers the exterior. The cake is then left overnight in the refrigerator (or \"icebox\"). The wafers absorb moisture from the whipped cream and the whole can be served in slices. The dessert is usually served by cutting it into slices at a 45-degree angle, so bands of chocolate and cream are visible across each slice. The traditional wafers are the thin and dark Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, but they may be hard to find in some areas so other cookies are sometimes substituted.\n\nThe icebox cake is derived from similar desserts such as the charlotte and the trifle. It was first introduced to the US during World War I. Its popularity took off in the 1920s and 30s, as it used many commercial shortcuts and premade ingredients. In response to the dish’s popularity, companies that manufactured ingredients for the cake, such as condensed milk and wafer cookies, began printing “back of the box” recipes.\n\nA variation of icebox cake is made using pudding (usually chocolate) and graham crackers or vanilla wafers layered in a square or rectangular baking dish. Ernestine Emanuel, an Italian immigrant from New York, has been credited with creating the graham cracker version. She had originally created the cake after having graham crackers with chocolate pudding, while on her honeymoon in Atlantic City, NJ. Additional variations include alternating layers of chocolate and vanilla pudding, or the addition of sliced bananas or pineapples between the layers. While this can be done with cold instant pudding, if given ample time in the \"icebox,\" the best results come from assembling the dessert with still-hot stove-cooked pudding, and then refrigerating overnight.\n\nIn Australia the cake is made from Arnott's Chocolate Ripple biscuits, hence the name in that country of Chocolate Ripple cake. The biscuits are covered in sweetened whipped cream, and placed in a log formation. It is often decorated with crumbled chocolate, fresh berries or grated Peppermint Crisp. \n\nIn the Philippines, mango float is a popular icebox cake variant of the traditional \"crema de fruta\" layered dessert. It is made with graham crackers or \"broas\" (ladyfingers) in between layers of whipped cream, condensed milk, and fresh mangoes.\n\n"}

The syntax for reading and writing of properties is like for fields, but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to 'getter' and 'setter' method calls. The field-like syntax is easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls \"under the hood\" allows for data validation, active updating (e.g., of GUI elements), or implementation of what may be called \"read-only fields\". \n\nSee an instructive example for C# language below.\n\nProgramming languages that support properties include ActionScript 3, C#, D, Delphi/Free Pascal, eC, F#, Kotlin, JavaScript, Objective-C 2.0, Python, Scala, Swift, Lua, and Visual Basic. Some object-oriented languages, such as Java and C++, don't support properties, and require the programmer to define a pair of \"accessor\" and \"mutator\" methods instead. Oberon-2 provides an alternative mechanism using object variable visibility flags. Other languages designed for the Java Virtual Machine, such as Groovy, do natively support properties. While C++ doesn't have first class properties, they can be emulated due to operator overloading. Also note that some C++ compilers support first class properties (the Microsoft C++ compiler as an example).\n\nIn most languages, properties are implemented as a pair of accessor/mutator methods, but accessed using the same syntax as for public fields. Omitting a method from the pair yields a \"read-only\" or an uncommon \"write-only\" property.\n\nIn some languages with no built-in support for properties, a similar construct can be implemented as a single method that either returns or changes the underlying data, depending on the context of its invocation. Such techniques are used e.g. in Perl.\n\nSome languages (Ruby, Smalltalk) achieve property-like syntax using normal methods, sometimes with a limited amount of syntactic sugar.\n\nSome languages follow well-established syntax conventions for formally specifying and utilizing properties and methods.\n\nAmong these conventions:\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates dot notation in JavaScript.\n\nThe following example demonstrates bracket notation in JavaScript.\n\nRecent C# versions also allow \"auto-implemented properties\" where the backing field for the property is generated by the compiler during compilation. This means that the property must have a setter. However, it can be private.\n\nC++ does not have first class properties, but there exist several ways to emulate properties to a limited degree. Two of which follow:\n\nAn example taken from the MSDN documentation page.\n\nIn D version 2, each property accessor or mutator must be marked with @property:\n\nThe above example could be used in an arbitrary method like this:\n\nProperties only work correctly for new-style classes (classes that have codice_1 as a [[Superclass (computer science)|superclass]]), and are only available in Python 2.2 and newer (see the relevant section of the tutorial \"Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2\"). Python 2.6 added a new syntax involving decorators for defining properties.\n\nRuby also provides automatic getter/setter synthesizers defined as instance methods of Class.\n\n\n[[Category:Object-oriented programming]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Java code]]"}

The title of the robe was changed to the Legacy Robe in July 2018.\n\nBefore curtain on the opening night of a Broadway musical, actors, stage managers, crew, and everyone associated with the play gather onstage for the Gypsy Robe ceremony. At the center of the stage will be a representative of Actors' Equity Association and a recently honored gypsy. The honored gypsy wears the robe that's decorated with mementos and drawings from past shows. The Equity representative tells the history of the ritual and announces the newest recipient from the company. The new recipient puts on the robe, and circles the stage counter-clockwise three times as everyone touches the robe for good luck. The Gypsy Robe recipient then makes their way throughout the theatre to continue bringing good luck.\nAccording to Actors' Equity Association, the following are the rules of the Gypsy Robe:\n\nThe ritual dates to 1950, when Florence Baum, a chorus member in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\", entered the men's dressing room wearing a robe, pale pink with white feathers. The men took turns trying it on. Fellow chorus member, Bill Bradley, sent a dressing gown from one of his fellow performers to his friend performing in \"Call Me Madam\". A feathered rose from Ethel Merman's costume was attached to the robe, and it was then given to a chorus member in \"Guys and Dolls\". The robe continued to be passed from one show to another, each time with a memento added on.\n\nThe ritual has become more formal, with rules about how it is presented, worn, and displayed. When robes are full of artifacts, a new robe is started. Retired robes are kept at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, at the Smithsonian, and at Actors' Equity.\n\nIn 2005, Brynn Williams from the Broadway cast of \"In My Life\" became the youngest recipient of the Gypsy Robe at age 12.\n\nOn April 18, 2018, Actors Equity announced that the name of robe would be changed at the end of the current theater season.

It is known in Ashkenazi Jewish, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Armenian, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian cuisines. Its other English names, spelled variously schav, shchav, shav, or shtshav, are borrowed from the Yiddish language, which in turn derives from Slavic languages, like for example Belarusian шчаўе, Russian and Ukrainian щавель, \"shchavel\", Polish \"szczaw\". The soups name comes ultimately from the Proto-Slavic \"ščаvь\" for sorrel. Due to its commonness as a soup in Eastern European cuisines, it is often called green borscht, as a cousin of the standard, reddish-purple beetroot borscht. In Russia, where shchi (along with or rather than borscht) has been the staple soup, sorrel soup is also called green shchi. In old Russian cookbooks it was called simply green soup.\n\nSorrel soup usually includes further ingredients such as egg yolks or whole eggs (hard boiled or scrambled), potatoes, carrots, parsley root, and rice.

It is related to \"ad majorem Dei gloriam\", a Latin phrase meaning \"for the greater glory of God\", the motto of the Society of Jesus. Magis refers to the philosophy of doing more for Christ, and therefore doing more for others. It is an expression of an aspiration and inspiration. It relates to forming the ideal society centered on Jesus Christ.\n\nModern use of the word is often traced to St. Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises or retreat, where he would have the exercitant ask: \"What have I done for Christ? What am I doing for Christ? and What ought I to do for Christ?\" The \"more\" intimately we come to know Christ, according to St. Ignatius, the \"more\" we will love him and the \"more\" closely we will follow him. Throughout the Exercises, a grace we are to ask for is to follow Christ \"more\" closely or to do what is \"more\" pleasing to God. This is frequently mentioned in the \"points\" for contemplating Christ's life which Ignatius proposes. Ignatius calls it the highest degree of humility for us to always want to be \"more\" like Christ in matters of poverty and worldly honors. Also, in what Ignatius calls the First Principle and Foundation of the Christian life, he concludes with the admonition: \"Our one desire and choice should be what is more conducive to the end for which we are created.\" This concept of doing \"more\" occurs frequently throughout the Ignatian Exercises.\n\nChris Lowney in his book \"Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World\", exposes the key to successful leadership based in the jesuit magis: \n\n\"Magis-driven leadership inevitably leads to heroism. Heroism begins with each person considering, internalizing, and shaping his or her mission. Whether one works within a large organization or alone, no mission is motivating until it is personal. And it is sustainable only when one makes the search for magis a reflexive, daily habit. A magis-driven leader is not content to go through the motions or settle for the status quo but is restlessly inclined to look for something more, something greater. Instead of wishing circumstances were different, magis-driven leaders either make them different or make the most of them. Instead of waiting for golden opportunities, they find the gold in the opportunities at hand.\"\n\nContemporary uses of \"magis\" often have Ignatian roots. Beginning in 1997 Jesuits have invited students to a \"Magis\" gathering, as before World Youth Day celebrations, to share the ideals which they learned in the Jesuit tradition. Also, the name Magis has been used for a Jesuit journal and newspaper and on banners heralding Jesuit education. The term is frequently central to the mission statement of Jesuit schools and can serve as a name for a voluntary service program or for an educational enhancement program for needy students. A video produced by Jesuits points out that the \"more\" is a matter of depth and quality, rather than of quantity.\n\nThe concept of Magis as an ideal of life is emphasized in many of the Jesuit universities across the globe. One of the 10 Service Organizations on campus at Loyola Marymount University uses Magis as its name. The organization stands to allow students to be leaders and contribute in the greater Los Angeles Community in the areas of Homelessness and Education, citing their three pillars of Service, Diversity, and spirituality on the strive for \"The more\" that is emphasized in the contemporary definition of the term.\n"}

Nowadays they are usually made from a combination of water buffalo and cow's milk. Bocconcini are packaged in whey or water, have a spongy texture and absorb flavours.\n\nThis cheese is described by its Italian name which means \"small mouthfuls\". It is made in the \"pasta filata\" manner by dipping curds into hot whey, and kneading, pulling and stretching. Each cheese is about the size, shape and colour of a hardboiled egg: indeed an alternative name used is Uova di bufala, or “Buffalo eggs”. Baby (\"bambini\") bocconcini can also be purchased; these are a smaller version about the size of large grapes or cherries. These smaller versions are also known as \"cillengini\".\n\nBocconcini of water buffalo’s milk are still produced in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Salerno, as \"bocconcini alla panna di bufala\", in a process which involves mixing freshly made Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP with fresh cream. A \"Bocconcino di Bufala Campana DOP\" is also made, which is simply Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP, produced in the egg-sized format.\n\nBocconcini of whole cow's milk are also manufactured, where the higher liquid content, in comparison to standard mozzarella, lends them the soft consistency of \"fior di latte\".\n\nBocconcini can be bought at most Italian supermarkets and is often used in tomato and basil salads and to accompany pasta or Italian water biscuits.\n\n\n"}

Though tepache is fermented for several days, the resulting drink does not contain much alcohol. In Mexican culinary practice, the alcoholic content of tepache may be increased with a small amount of beer.\n\nIn Mexico, tepache is usually sold as a chilled drink by street vendors. In the U.S., it is sold in juice bars in the Mexican American communities of the Southwestern United States. The fermentation process for making tepache is simple and quick, which makes tepache a drink readily produced at home.\n\nTepache dates from Pre-Columbian Mexico, as a popular drink among the Nahua people of central Mexico; in the Nahuatl (also known as Aztec) language, the word \"tepiātl\" means \"drink made from corn\". Originally, corn (maize) was the base of tepache, but the contemporary recipe for tepache uses pineapple rinds as the foodstuff fermented to produce the tart drink that is \"tepache\". Some varieties of tepache, known as \"tepache de tibicos\", are fermented using symbiotic cultures of \"tibicos\".\n\nBecause of the popularity of tepache in Mexico, the drink is now being produced commercially as a non-alcoholic drink. There are a few different brands of tepache including \"Tepache\" from the Frumex Corporation.\nThe original Frumex Tepache contained 12% juice and was made from fermented skins and pulp along with some sugar, spices, and barley. That version was replaced with a newer version that contained only 10% juice and no barley. That one was made from only fermented pineapple juice, no skins or pulp. The latest version, now rebranded as Tepachito, still contains only 10% juice but it is made from fermented juice and skin, no barley. It does include white and brown sugar and spices.\n\nThe drink tepache is mentioned in the popular Spanish-language quebradita song \"La Niña Fresa\" (\"The Spoiled Girl\"), by \"Banda Zeta\", in which the spoiled-girl character is offered several types of drink — including tepache — yet she refuses them all, for being beneath her social status.\n\nIn Street Fighter IV, the luchador character El Fuerte has a move list that reads like a combination of a restaurant menu and wrestling moves; \"\"Tepache Bomb\"\" is one such item referenced in it.\n\n"}

Brought to Mexico City in the 1860s by Emperor Maximilian's troupe of cooks, its use quickly spread throughout the country.\n\nIt is about 15 cm (six inches) long, in the shape of an ovoid, with a crunchy crust and a soft inside known as \"migajón\" (). It is the main ingredient for \"tortas\" and \"molletes\". A variation of the bolillo is the \"telera\", which is very similar, though it has a more rounded shape, is divided into three sections, and is usually softer. Other variations include \"bolillos\" made of alternate ingredients such as whole wheat, wheat germ, or flax.\n\nThe \"bolillo\" is a variation of the baguette, and thus often has names in the local language reflecting this. In Yucatán, they are known as \"barras\". In Guadalajara and Sonora, they are called \"birotes\" which are often made with sourdough. In northern Mexico, they are known both as \"bolillos\" and \"pan blanco\", whereas in northeast Mexico it is known as \"pan francés\". In Sinaloa, they are called \"torcido\" and \"birote\". In Central America, especially in El Salvador, it is also known as \"pan francés. \"In Panama, a similar but longer type of bread is known as \"flauta \"(flute) while \"pan francés \"refers to the thinner, crustier French baguette. In Brazil, a similar bread is made and known as \"pão francês\" or \"pão de sal\" (\"bread of salt\"). In the Philippines, another similar baguette-derived bread is known as \"pan de sal\" (also \"bread of salt\").\n\n\"Bolillo\" is a slang term used in some parts of Mexico and the United States to refer to Anglos or, more generally, any pale-skinned person. The usage is similar to the word \"gringo\" or \"gabacho\" and may or may not be a pejorative slur depending on the region and social context.\n\nA more common meaning is used when a person says the expression \"\"puro bolillo\"\" (lit. only french bread), which is equivalent with the English slang word \"zilch\".\n"}

All these types can be fixed or removable.\nAn active appliance is a device used to apply forces to the teeth to change the relationship of the teeth.\n\nRemovable active appliances are intended for simple tipping movements. Use of removable appliances in modern orthodontics is much more limited than in the past due to their various shortcomings.\n\nEdward Angle, regarded as the father of American orthodontics, developed many universal fixed active appliances, unifying orthodontic practice. \n\nThere is a totally different orthodontics approach without extraction and pain, is called functional orthodontics, the functional orthodontic technology is different and called functional appliance, that is an appliance that produces all or part of its effect by altering the position of the mandible/maxilla. Also known as dentofacial orthopaedic appliances, these appliances utilize the muscle action of the patient and responses of nervous system to produce orthodontic or orthopaedic forces. Various functional appliances have been described. There is a List of Orthodontic Functional Appliances.\n\nOrthodontic headgear is a type of appliance attached to dental braces that aids in correcting more severe bite problems.\n\nHeadgear is an orthodontic appliance for the correction of Class II correction, typically used in growing patients to correct overbites by holding back the growth of the upper jaw, allowing the lower jaw to catch up.\n\nThe headgear can also be used to make more space for teeth to come in. The headgear is then attached to the molars (via molar headgear bands & tubes), and helps to push or draw them backwards in the mouth, opening up space for the front teeth to be moved back using braces and bands.\n\nHeadgear needs to be worn approximately 12 to 22 hours a day to be truly effective in correcting the overbite, and treatment is usually anywhere from 6 to 18 months in duration, depending on the severity of the overbite and how much a patient is growing.\n\nFacemask or reverse-pull headgear is used to control the growth of the maxillary and mandibular bones during orthodontic treatment.\n\nThe appliance is used in growing patients to correct under bites (known as a Class III orthodontic problem) by pulling forward and assisting the growth of the upper jaw, allowing the upper jaw to catch up.\n\nFacemasks or reverse-pull headgear needs to be worn approximately 12 to 22 hrs to be truly effective in correcting the under bite, usually anywhere from 6 to 18 months depending on the severity of the bite and how much a patient is growing.\n\nThe appliance normally consists of a frame or a centre bars that are strapped to the patients head during a fitting appointment. The frame has a section which is positioned in front of the patients mouth, which allows for the attachment of elastic or rubber bands directly into the mouth area. These elastics are then hooked onto the child's braces (brackets and bands) or appliance fitted in his or her mouth.\n\nThis creates a forward 'pulling' force to pull the upper jaw forward.\n\n\n"}

The sternalis muscle may be a variation of the pectoralis major or of the rectus abdominis.\n\nThe sternalis is a muscle that runs along the anterior aspect of the body of the sternum. It lies superficially and parallel to the sternum. Its origin and insertion are variable. The sternalis muscle often originates from the upper part of the sternum and can display varying insertions such as the pectoral fascia, lower ribs, costal cartilages, rectus sheath, aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle. There is still a great deal of disagreement about its innervation and its embryonic origin.\n\nIn a review, it was reported that the muscle was innervated by the external or internal thoracic nerves in 55% of the cases, by the intercostal nerves in 43% of the cases, while the remaining cases were supplied by both nerves. However, innervation by the pectoral nerves has also been reported. This appears to indicate that the sternalis is not always derived from the same embryonic origin.\n\nCadaveric studies showed that the sternalis muscle has a mean prevalence of around 7.8% in the population with the range from 0.5% to 23.5%. It has a slightly higher incidence in females. Though, It was proposed that a possible reason for the high prevalence may result from the existence of small, ill-defined or tendinous fibres, which could be misidentified for a sternalis muscle.\n\nA recent study classified the sternalis into three types depending on morphology.\nType I, the single head and single belly was seen in the majority of reported cases (58.5%), type II in 18.1%, and type III in 23.4%.\n\nIn addition to the above classification, triple-bellied/double-headed sternalis has also been reported.\n\nTheir is no apparent physiological function of the sternalis muscle. However, there are many theories for a function. It may function as a proprioceptive sensor for thoracic wall movements. It may also take part in the movement of the shoulder joint or have an additional role in elevation of the chest wall.\n\nThe presence of the sternalis is asymptomatic but aesthetic complaints have been reported as it was reported to cause chest asymmetry or deviation of the nipple-areola complex. The presence of the sternalis may cause alterations in the electrocardiogram or confusion in mammography. However, there is a potential benefit of the muscle as it can be used as a flap in a reconstructive surgery of the head and neck and the anterior chest wall.\n\nThe sternalis was first reported by Carbolius in 1604 and the name was first given by Turner in 1867. Different terminologies have been given to the sternalis due to its highly varied morphology and the disagreement on its embryonic origin. The sternalis was referred to as the \"rectus sternalis,\" \"sternalis brutorum, musculus sternalis, episternalis, parasternalis, presternalis, rectus sterni, rectus thoracis, rectus thoracicus superficialis, superficial rectus abdominis, sternalis brutorum, japonicas, and thoracicus\" depending on studies\".\"\n"}

Thus honey buckwheat wine was called \"yakju\" (약주), honey rice was called \"yakban\" (약반, old word for \"yaksik\"), and fried honey ricecake was called \"yakgwa\" (약과).\n\nRecords of \"yaksik\" can be found in \"Samguk Yusa\", written in the 13th century. Legend says that King Soji of Silla headed on a journey on the 15th of January, 488, when a crow alerted him of danger. The King saved himself from a potential revolt thanks to the crow's warning and the day of January 15 was designated as a day of remembrance thereafter. Glutinous rice was put up as an offering during the commemorative rites, which became the origin of \"yaksik\".\n\nThe adding of pine nuts, chestnuts, jujubes, honey, and oil were added in the Goryeo era. \"Yaksik\" is also mentioned in various books from the Joseon period such as \"Dongguk Sesigi\" (동국세시기), \"Yeolyang Seisigi\" (열양세시기), \"Dong'guk Yeoji Seungram\" (동국여지승람). In \"Yeolyang Seisigi\", it is said that envoys to China shared \"yaksik\" with the people in Yeonkyung, and most enjoyed the dish.\n\nGlutinous rice is steamed and mixed with honey, brown sugar, and \"ganjang\" to colorize the rice. Soft-boiled chestnuts, pine nuts, sesame oil and quartered jujubes with the seeds removed are added to this mixture with the entire mix is resteamed. The \"yaksik\" is then put into desired shapes such as flat squares and left to cool before eating.\n\n\n"}

Similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce.\n\nThe etymology of \"half-smoke\" possibly comes from the original half-pork, half-beef composition, the ingredients and smoked method of preparation. Another possible explanation is that the texture and flavor is halfway between smoked sausage and a regular hot dog. Yet another explanation is that it refers to cooks cutting the sausage in half when grilling. Composition of the sausages varies by brand and some brands even make more than one kind. A half-smoke can be half pork, half beef, all beef, or anything in between. It can be steamed instead of smoked. The company thought to be the originator of the sausage, Briggs & Company, was sold by its owner, Raymond Briggs, in 1950 without clarifying the origin of the name. The products sold under the name generally have a genuine or artificial smoke flavoring and coarser texture than a regular hot dog; these are the key features that distinguish them.\n\nThe \"original\" half-smoke is considered to be the sausage distributed by D.C.'s Briggs and Co. meatpackers, originating in around 1950, though Raymond Briggs started selling his half-smokes in about 1930. Eventually, Briggs was sold to another meat distributor, where, by some accounts, the quality of the meat declined.\n\nNumerous hot dog carts in Washington, D.C., sell steamed half-smokes, with those on Constitution Avenue catering to tourists and those on Pennsylvania Avenue and many other hot dog carts throughout the downtown area serving federal employees. Half-smokes are the \"official dog\" of the Washington Nationals. The most prominent location is often cited as Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington's U Street neighborhood, which gained widespread exposure when visited by Bill Cosby in the 1980s and later by President-elect Barack Obama in 2009.\n\nAnother popular location for half-smokes is the Weenie Beenie in South Arlington, Virginia, located near the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Regional Park trail. Founded in 1950, it pre-dates Ben's Chili Bowl. Among newer purveyors is Meats & Foods, on Florida Avenue just east of Ben's Chili Bowl, which makes its own handmade version of the sausage.\n\n"}
{"id": "6077396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6077396", "title": "Size of groups, organizations, and communities", "text": "Size of groups, organizations, and communities\n\nSize (the number of people involved) is an important characteristic of the groups, organizations, and communities in which social behavior occurs.\n\nWhen only a few persons are interacting, adding just one more individual may make a big difference in how they relate. As an organization or community grows in size it is apt to experience tipping points where the way in which it operates needs to change. The complexity of large groupings is partly because they are made up of interrelated subgroups.\n\nHerbert Thelen proposed a principle that for members of groups to have maximum motivation to perform, the number of members in each should be the smallest \"in which it is possible to have represented at a functional level all the social and achievement skills required for the particular required activity.\" \n\nGroups of two persons (called by many names: dyads, pairs, couples, etc.) are important either while standing alone or as building blocks of larger groupings. An infant requires a caregiver in order to survive, so life begins in a pair relationship that is apt to influence later ones. \n\nPair relations can be trivial and fleeting (like that of a clerk and customer at a checkout stand) or multi-purpose and enduring (like a lifelong marriage). Unlike a larger group, though, which can replace lost members and last indefinitely, a dyad exists only as long as both member participate.\n\nPairing off is very common for several reasons. It is simpler to relate to one other person than to several at once. We are comfortable in dealing with someone who is similar to ourselves, and any two persons can usually find common traits or experiences to serve as \"hook up points\" between them. On the other hand, we are also fascinated by people who are different from us. Novelty, of course, wears off. \n\nDifferences can be the basis for long-term alliances when they are complementary. He can fix the lawn mower and she is a good cook; Gilbert writes the book and Sullivan composes the music. Topping all is that \"game that two are playing,\" sexual mating, with its many and powerful effects on human affairs.\n\nGroups with three members (triads, trios, troikas, etc.) are hard to maintain. After all, it is easier to deal with one other person than with two. Besides, two of the people in a triad are apt to find it easier to relate to each other than to the other partner. That can motivate the neglected party to drop out of the group. \n\nWhere polygamy is practiced, a husband taking a second wife will often provide her with separate quarters so as to have two pair relationships instead of a contentious household of three adults. In polyamory, at least two types of relationships are observed: a \"V\" relationship, where one partner has a romantic relationship with both other members, and a triad, where everyone is involved romantically. Either situation may or may not prove to be satisfying and lasting. \n\nIn history, three leaders have sometimes attempted to share political power in a triumvirate, with little long-term success. \n\nOn the other hand, groups of three can be very stable if there is a leader and two followers, such as a family of a single parent and two children. Likewise, a subordinate may be related to two power-figures, e.g., an only child with two parents.\n\nWith the notable exception of vocal and musical quartets, groups of four tend not to last very long. Two persons in the group are apt to find it more satisfying to relate to each other than to either of the others. If the other two feel left out, they have at least that in common. They may feel a need to counteract the advantage a pair has when acting together over an individual operating alone. The relationship becomes one of two pairs rather than an effective group of four members.\n\nIn decision-making groups the tendency to split two against two can lead to frustrating stalemates. Differences can be resolved more easily if the group starts out with three or five rather than four members.\n\nOn the other hand, a group of four can be stable if it depends upon unique contributions from each of its members. In a musical quartet each participant’s part is different and essential. The more experience the musicians have in playing together the better they can perform. Some such groups stay together for decades.\n\nStability can also result when there is one leader and three subordinates. A similar but short-lived pattern occurs at cocktail parties: studies of social gatherings find frequent clusters of one person talking and three listening.\n\nAs a group gets larger, adding another person has less effect on its characteristics. A consideration at least in smaller groups, though, is whether the number of members is even or odd. Doing things together is easy if all those involved agree on what to do, or if majority opinion is able to override objections without repelling the objectors. A group of six or eight members can split into two equal factions, so decision-making is not apt to be as easy as if the size were five, seven or nine. As groups get larger stalemates are less likely but still can be troublesome. If a group makes decisions by voting it can adopt a means of tie-breaking (requiring one vote more than 50% for a measure to be adopted, giving the presiding officer a tie-breaking vote, or deciding by coin toss). \n\nMenon and Phillips (2011) found that even-sized small groups often experience lower cohesion than odd-sized small groups. \n\nAs the size of a group increases:\n\nMany human activities are too big, difficult, or complex to be accomplished by a single person. At the same time, they may require such close coordination that if more than, say, a half dozen persons try to collaborate they get in each other's way, lose a common focus, and tend to work at cross purposes.\n\nOur species has depended largely on subsistence provided by collaboration among members of the immediate family: a woman who bears, nurses, and looks after children (with aid and advice of her mother), and does chores consistent with those responsibilities; a man, who is free to range farther from the home base for food and materials and can do things that require extra strength or concentration; and the children providing whatever assistance is required of them as they grow more capable. \n\nDeliberative bodies, such as legislatures, commissions, and advisory boards, discuss and vote on proposals. The work of researching and drafting the proposals is done sometimes by individuals but often by the collaboration of a small sub-group.\n\nMilitary operations are carried out by directing the efforts of a number of small, highly coordinated units that do the actual fighting, for example infantry units, gun crews, or bomber crews.\n\nIn many sports a team consists of five or six players. Baseball manages with the large number of nine because any given play involves only a few of teammates. American football requires coordinating a team of eleven players. The team huddles before an offensive play to let the players know what they need to do so that the ball-handler doesn't have to keep track of each of them.\n\nMuch economic activity (farming, mining, production, sales, etc.) is carried out by small groups, each of whose members work together under the supervision of a first-line manager. (See team.)\n\nImportant decisions often require more expertise and sources of information than is possessed by any individual. Historically a king has had a council of courtiers, a Pope a College of Cardinals, a corporation a board of directors. Executives or legislative bodies appoint advisory committees, policy-making boards, and fact-finding commissions.\n\nAll these groups benefit from having members who are diverse in their information sources, talents and experience. This kind of group is usually bigger than a production team. The more complex the issues the more different viewpoints will be needed. At the same time practical considerations dictate how large the group can be. Once you have a couple of dozen members, adding another is not likely to add much to the information available from the others. At about that size there is no longer enough time at meetings to hear from everyone, and participants can't be seated so that they can easily see and listen to each other.\n\nAn intimate community is one in which some members recognize and are recognized by all of the others, and most of the members recognize and are recognized by many of the others. This is in contrast to (usually larger) communities where members are known and interact mostly within their own subgroup, such as neighborhood, department, or occupation. The contrast between the two types is illustrated by comparing hamlet with town, military company with battalion, parish church with diocese, or a country school with a huge urban one.\n\nIntimate communities seldom have more than about 150 members. Dunbar's number is based on studies of social animals, which have shown a correlation between the typical frontal brain capacity the members of a species and the maximum size of the groups in which they live. The number of relationships the human brain can handle is large but not unlimited. \nIn a small church the minister typically knows everyone, and the congregation is “one big family.” It is not easy to grow beyond 150 members, however, because that requires (besides a bigger building) augmenting the minister with paid staff, systematically recruiting and training volunteers, and dealing with increased numbers and diversity by developing specialized groups and programs.\n\nEducators are advocating subdividing large schools into smaller units so that staff can know all the students and there will be more feeling of belonging, support and continuity.\n\nAs settlements grow in population they increase in density, complexity, diversity, and administrative apparatus. The character of community life is enough different at different ranges of size that distinctive terms have developed (from smaller to larger): hamlet, village, town, city, metropolis, megalopolis. There is, however, little agreement on exactly where in the growth process a place passes from one of these categories to the next. \n\nIt has been observed that the population of a city is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in size among the urban areas of its economic region \n( Zipf's law ).\n\nTheodore Caplow, \"Two Against One: Coalitions in Triads\", 1968\n\n"}

{"id": "6081663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6081663", "title": "Okinawan cuisine", "text": "Okinawan cuisine\n\nOkinawan cuisine incorporates influences from Chinese cuisine and Southeast Asian cuisine due to its long history of trade. The sweet potato, introduced in Okinawa in 1605, became a staple food in Okinawa from then until the beginning of the 20th century. An article about Okinawan food written by Kikkoman states that Goya (bitter melon) and Nabera (luffa or towel gourd) were \"likely\" introduced to Okinawa from Southeast Asia. Since Ryukyu had served as a tributary state to China, Ryukyuan cooks traveled to Fujian Province to learn how to cook Chinese food; Chinese influence seeped into Okinawa in that manner. The same Kikkoman article states that the method of distillation of awamori likely originated from Siam (Thailand) and traveled to Okinawa during the 15th century. After the lord of the Kagoshima Domain invaded the Ryukyus, Okinawan cooks traveled to Japan to study Japanese cuisine, causing that influence to seep into Okinawan cuisine.\n\nOkinawa was administered by the United States after World War II, during which time various canned foods were popularized. American hamburger shops entered into the Okinawa market earlier than on the mainland. It was during this period that Okinawans became familiar with Americanized food culture. The cuisine has evolved in modern times, especially because of the American military presence on Okinawa since the end of World War II.\n\nBesides vegetables and fruits, the influences of southern and southeastern Asia are evident in Okinawan cuisine in its use of herbs and spices, such as turmeric, used in Okinawa more often than in mainland Japan, but less frequently than other tropical island cuisines. Okinawan cuisine's condiments consist mainly of salt, miso, bonito flakes (katsuobushi) or kombu. Compared to mainland diets, Okinawan dishes do not use as many kinds of mushroom. \n\nAnother characteristic of Okinawan cuisine is its reliance on meat. The main protein sources of Okinawan cuisine are derived from livestock, specifically pigs. Buddhism spread less widely in Okinawa, and the islands were less influenced by the non-meat eating practices of the Tokugawa shogunate. Okinawan has had a culture of using livestock since the Edo period. An Okinawan saying states that Okinawan cuisine \"begins with pig and ends with pig\" and \"every part of a pig can be eaten except its hooves and its oink.\"\n\nDespite being surrounded by the sea, Okinawans eat relatively little seafood compared to other maritime cultures. Fish and other seafood products were traditionally difficult to preserve in the high temperatures of the Okinawan islands. Additionally, the islands are surrounded by relatively few fish species. The primary preparations of fish are pickling in salt (shio-zuke), dried, grilled, simmered in soy sauce (nitsuke), and as kamaboko, a processed seafood product typically made from white fish. Sashimi is served in Okinawa, but is limited by the inability to retain freshness due to high temperatures on the islands. Sashimi, unlike on the main islands of Japan, is not part of a full course meal.\n\nEdible kelp varieties are also popular ingredients, such as kombu. Okinawans make salad, soup, or tempura using Cladosiphon okamuranus(モズク), Hijiki and so on. Okinawan cuisine frequently uses kombu, not only in making soup stock, but also in preparing braised dishes, stir fried dishes and so on. Although it is not cultivated in the region, Okinawa is one of the largest consumers of kombu in Japan. \n\nOkinawan staple foods are traditionally potatoes, such as sweet potato or taro root, but they are substituted to rice or wheat flour, then Okinawans developed original dishes such as taco rice, etc.\n\nAfter the end of the occupation, they still have original food cultures, and Americanized foods are frequently eaten in their diets. But, Okinawan people do not consume dairy foods so much, such as milk and cheese. Bread is not so popular as a staple food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkinawans are known for their longevity; five times as many Okinawans live to be 100 than the rest of Japan, and the Japanese themselves are the longest lived nationality in the world.\n"}

It is associated with Ireland and Irish folklore.\n\nShillelaghs are traditionally made from blackthorn (sloe) wood (\"Prunus spinosa\") or oak. Wood from the root was prized as it was less prone to crack or break during use. The wood would be smeared with butter or lard, and placed up a chimney to cure, giving the shillelagh its typical black shiny appearance. Another method was to bury the shank in a dung pile for roughly the same amount of time. Rarer still was brining, where the shank was placed into a basin of saltwater. The saltwater, being a hypertonic solution, would pull moisture from the shank with little warping. Both of the previous methods would be finished with oils or sealants. Black paint or even magpie blood was sometimes used to give it a darker appearance. \n\nShillelaghs may be hollowed at the heavy \"hitting\" end and filled with molten lead to increase the weight beyond the typical two pounds; this sort of shillelagh is known as a 'loaded stick'. They are commonly the length of a walking stick (distance from the floor to one's wrist with elbow slightly bent). Most also have a heavy knob for a handle which can be used for striking as well as parrying and disarming an opponent. Many shillelaghs also have a strap attached, similar to commercially made walking sticks, to place around the holder's wrist.\n\nOriginally known in Irish as the , or stick, the name shillelagh is an Anglophone corruption (phonological adaptation) of the Irish \"sail éille\" and appears to have been associated with the name of the village and barony of Shillelagh, County Wicklow.\nThe shillelagh was originally used for settling disputes in a gentlemanly manner — like a duel with pistols or swords. Modern practitioners of bataireacht study the use of the shillelagh for self-defense and as a martial art. Of the practice, researcher J. W. Hurley writes:\nMethods of shillelagh fighting have evolved over a period of thousands of years, from the spear, staff, axe and sword fighting of the Irish. There is some evidence which suggests that the use of Irish stick weapons may have evolved in a progression from a reliance on long spears and wattles, to shorter spears and wattles, to the shillelagh, alpeen, blackthorn (walking-stick) and short cudgel. By the 19th century Irish shillelagh-fighting had evolved into a practice which involved the use of three basic types of weapons, sticks which were long, medium or short in length.\n\nIn modern usage, the shillelagh is recognised (particularly in an Irish-American context) as a symbol of Irishness. For example, the officers of the Fighting 69th regiment of the United States Army National Guard carry shillelaghs as rank badges in parades. The Boston Celtics logo has a leprechaun leaning on his shillelagh, and it is regularly featured with the leprechaun on the logos for many Brothers Rugby league teams across Australia. In San Diego, Padres broadcaster Mark Grant popularised the shillelagh as a rally call, by using terms like \"Shillelagh Power\" to describe late game heroics by the Padres. The success of the phrase led the San Diego Padres store to carry inflatable shillelaghs. Similarly, in the college games of American football, a Jeweled Shillelagh is the trophy given to the winner of the rivalry game between the USC Trojans and Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Professional wrestler Finlay carried a shillelagh to the ring in December 2006 as an \"illegal weapon\".\n\nShillelaghs are sometimes referred to in a similar context in folk songs, such as in the ballad \"Finnegan's Wake\", in which the term \"shillelagh law\" refers to a brawl, in the anti-recruiting folk song \"Arthur McBride\", where the recruiters are struck with a shillelagh, and in the 19th century song \"Rocky Road to Dublin\", in which references are made to fashioning a shillelagh, using it to hold a tied bag over one's shoulder, and using it as a striking weapon.\n\nThe MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile was named after the club.\n\nLt Colonel John Storch of the 364th Fighter Squadron – 357th Fighter Group based in Leiston Suffolk England from 1944–45 had a Mustang P-51B 2106826 named \"The Shillelagh\" and also had a P-51D 472164 with the same nose art.\n\nIn the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons, 'shillelagh' is a low-level spell used by casters to make simple wooden clubs or quarterstaves into powerful bludgeoning weapons. \n\nOfficers of the Irish Guards and Royal Irish Regiment carry Blackthorn sticks, as did past Irish Regiments of the British Army, such as the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons and Fusiliers.\n\n"}

Basketballs typically range in size from very small promotional items only a few inches in diameter to extra large balls nearly a foot in diameter used in training exercises. For example, a youth basketball could be in circumference, while a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) men's ball would be a maximum of and an NCAA women's ball would be a maximum of . The standard for a basketball in the National Basketball Association (NBA) is in circumference and for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), a maximum circumference of . High school and junior leagues normally use NCAA, NBA or WNBA sized balls.\n\nAside from the court and the baskets, the basketball is the only piece of equipment necessary to play the game of basketball. During the game, the ball must be bounced continuously (dribbling), thrown through the air to other players (passing) or thrown towards the basket (shooting). Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The ball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's index finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball over one's shoulder, or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam dunk, most notably in the context of a slam dunk contest.\n\nNearly all basketballs have an inflatable inner rubber bladder, generally wrapped in layers of fiber and then covered with a surface made either from leather (traditional), rubber, or a synthetic composite. As in most inflatable balls, there is a small opening that allows the pressure to be increased or decreased.\n\nThe surface of the ball is nearly always divided by \"ribs\" that are recessed below the surface of the ball in a variety of configurations and are generally a contrasting color. A brownish orange surface with black ribs and a possible logo is the traditional color scheme of basketballs but they are sold in various colors.\n\nBalls are generally designated for indoor (generally made of leather or absorbent composites), or all-surface use (generally made of rubber or durable composites, also known as indoor/outdoor balls). Indoor balls tend to be considerably more expensive than all-surface balls due to cost of materials. In addition, brand new all-leather indoor balls must be \"broken in\" first to achieve optimal grip before use in competition. The abrasiveness of asphalt and the dirt and moisture present in an outdoor setting will usually ruin an indoor ball within a very short period of time, which is why an indoor/outdoor ball is recommended for recreational players. Outdoor balls are commonly made from rubber to cope with rougher conditions, and they need to be filled with more air to retain a suitable level of air pressure in colder weather.\n\nDifferent sizes are used for different age groups. The common standards are:\n\nNote that the ball used for all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed) in the formalized halfcourt game of 3x3 combines characteristics of the size 6 and size 7 balls. Its circumference is that of a size 6 ball, but its weight is that of a size 7.\n\nIn early December 1891, the chairman of the physical education department at the School for Christian Workers (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, instructed physical education teacher James Naismith, to invent a new game to entertain the school's athletes in the winter season. Naismith assembled his class of 18 young men, appointed captains of two nine-player teams, and set in motion the first ever basketball game, played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets tacked to either end of the gymnasium.\n\nThe first purpose-built basketballs were made from panels of leather stitched together with a rubber bladder inside. A cloth lining was added to the leather for support and uniformity. A molded version of the early basketball was invented in 1942. For many years, leather was the material of choice for basketball coverings, however in the late 1990s, synthetic composite materials were put forth and have rapidly gained acceptance in most leagues.\n\nFrom 1967 through 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) used a distinctive red, white and blue basketball that is still seen from time to time.\n\n"}

The cold-smoking method (which can take up to a month, depending on the food) smokes the food at between 20° to 30° C (68° to 86° F). Hot-smoking partially or completely cooks the food by treating it at temperatures ranging from 40° to 90° C (104° to 194° F). \n\nAnother method, typically used in less expensive cheeses, is to use artificial smoke flavoring to give the cheese a smoky flavoring and food coloring to give the outside the appearance of having been smoked in the more traditional manner.\n\nSome smoked cheeses commonly produced and sold include smoked Gruyère, smoked Gouda (rookkaas), Provolone, Rauchkase, Scamorza, Sulguni, Oscypek, Fynsk rygeost, and smoked Cheddar.\n\n\n"}

It refers to both the alcoholic paste and the alcoholic beverage derived from it. It has a sweet or sour taste\nand can be eaten as is, as ingredients for traditional recipes, or fermented further to make rice wine (which in some cultures is also called \"tapai\"). \"Tapai\" is traditionally made with white rice or glutinous rice, but can also be made from a variety of carbohydrate sources, including cassava and potatoes. Fermentation is performed by a variety of moulds including \"Aspergillus oryzae\", \"Rhizopus oryzae\", \"Amylomyces rouxii\" or \"Mucor\" species, and yeasts including \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", and \"Saccharomycopsis fibuliger\", \"Endomycopsis burtonii\" and others, along with bacteria.\n\n\"Tapai\" is derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *tapay (\"fermented [food]\"), which in turn is derived from Proto-Austronesian *tapaJ (\"fermented [food]\"). Derived cognates has come to refer to a wide variety of fermented food throughout Austronesia, including yeasted bread and rice wine.\n\nProto-Malayo-Polynesian *tapay-an also refers to large earthen jars originally used for this fermentation process. Cognates in modern Austronesian languages include \"tapayan\" (Tagalog), \"tepayan\" (Iban), and \"tempayan\" (Javanese and Malay).\n\n\"Tapai\" is made by inoculating a carbohydrate source with the required microorganisms in a starter culture. This culture has different names in different regions, shown in the table below. The culture can be naturally captured from the wild, by mixing rice flour with ground spices (include garlic, pepper, chili, cinnamon), cane sugar or coconut water, slices of ginger or ginger extract, and water to make a dough. The dough is pressed into round cakes, about 3 cm across and 1 cm thick, and left to incubate on trays with banana leaves under and over them for two to three days. They are then dried and stored, ready for their next use.\n\nTraditionally, cooked white rice or glutinous rice are fermented in \"tapayan\" jars. Depending on the length of time and various processes, \"tapai\" will result in a large number of end products. These include slightly fermented dough used for rice cakes (Filipino \"galapong\"); dried fermented cakes (Indonesian \"brem\" cakes); fermented cooked rice (Filipino \"buro\", \"tapay\", \"inuruban\", \"binubudan\", \"binuboran\"; Indonesian/Malaysian \"tapai\" or \"tape\"); fermented rice with shrimp (Filipino \"buro\", \"balaobalao\", \"balobalo\", \"tag-ilo\"); fermented rice with fish (Filipino \"buro\"); or various rice wines (Filipino \"tapuy\", \"tapey\", \"bubod\", \"basi\", \"pangasi\"; Indonesian \"brem\" wine).\n\nIn modern times, in addition to rice, different types of carbohydrates such as cassava or sweet potatoes can also be used. The general process is to wash and cook the target food, cool to about 30 °C, mix in some powdered starter culture, and rest in covered jars for one to two days. With cassava and sweet potato, the tubers are washed and peeled before cooking, then layered in baskets with starter culture sprinkled over each layer. The finished gruel will taste sweet with a hint of alcohol, and can be consumed as is, or left for several days more to become sourer.\n\n\"Tapai\" and its variants are usually consumed as it is; as a sweet mildly-alcoholic snacks, to accompany tea in the afternoon. The sweet fermented \"tapai\" however, are often used as the ingredient in a recipe of certain dishes. Sundanese cassava \"peuyeum\" is the main ingredient for \"colenak\"; a roasted fermented cassava \"tapai\" served with \"kinca\" a sweet syrup made of grated coconut and liquid palm sugar. \"Colenak\" is Sundanese portmanteau of \"dicocol enak\" which translates to \"tasty dip\". \"Tapai uli\" is a roasted block of bland-tasted \"ketan\" or \"pulut\" (glutinous rice) served with sweet \"tapai ketan\" or \"tapai pulut\". The \"peuyeum goreng\" or \"tapai goreng\", or known in Javanese as \"rondho royal\" is another example of Indonesian \"gorengan\" (assorted fritters), which is deep fried battered cassava \"tapai\".\n\nIn beverages, \"tapai\", both cassava or glutinous rice, might be added into sweet iced concoction desserts, such as \"es campur\" and \"es doger\".\n\nIn the Philippines, there are various \"tapay\"-derived dishes and drinks. They were originally referred to by the term \"tinapay\" (literally \"done through \"tapay\"), as recorded by Antonio Pigafetta. But the term \"tinapay\" is now restricted to \"bread\" in modern Filipino languages. The most common use of fermented rice is in \"galapong\", a traditional Filipino viscous rice dough made by soaking (and usually fermenting) uncooked glutinous rice overnight and then grinding it into a paste. It is used as a base for various \"kakanin\" rice cakes (notably \"puto\" and \"bibingka\"). Fermented gruel-type \"tapay\" are also common, with various ethnic groups having their own versions like Tagalog and Kapampangan \"buro\" (which is similar to Japanese \"narezushi\"), the Ifugao \"binuburan\", and the Maranao \"tapay\".

{"id": "6161093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6161093", "title": "Tape ball", "text": "Tape ball\n\nA tape ball is a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of \"tape ball\" that in recent years some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls. These balls are quite popular in South Asia where tape ball cricket is one of the most popular forms of the sport.\n\nThe innovation of tape ball cricket began in Pakistan in the 1960s. In Karachi, where proper equipment, pitches and grounds are a luxury. Informal cricket games are played widely by children and young adults across the cricket-playing world, especially in South Asia. Local grounds, parks and city streets are common locations to find locals playing the games in afternoons and evenings. The tape ball provided a solution to a vexing issue for these cricket enthusiasts. The conventional cricket ball, with which professional and amateur club cricket is played, is made out of cork and leather, and is heavier than a baseball. Considerable effort is required on behalf of the bowlers to extract speed and bounce, as well as control of the length and direction. Playing with a conventional cricket ball requires a stronger cricket bat, and poses a constant danger to players and passers-by who may be struck and severely injured by the ball.\n\nIn informal games, either a rubber ball or tennis ball is used as an alternative. The rubber ball is not suitable for the variety of surfaces made use of in informal games; it is too bouncy on cement and concrete and barely bounces at all on grass or soil. An unmodified tennis ball is light, but it is incapable of gaining sufficient speed. By covering a tennis ball with electrical tape, the ball's weight and traction are increased, which in turn leads to greater bounce and speed. A tape ball can also be used to mimic a seaming cricket ball by adding an extra layer of tape around the circumference like a seam, the sides can be roughened to mimic conventional swing of a cricket ball. The tape ball is thus a sound compromise between safety and sincerity to the sport.\n\nEvery youth of Pakistan gets introduced to tape ball cricket very early on. Every city, town, and village has tape ball leagues (especially during the month of Ramadan). Export of this idea from Pakistanis who settled in the west has led to its popularity throughout UK, USA, and Canada. The tape ball has gained popularity in England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies, but remains most popular and widely used in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and, to a lesser extent, in Sri Lanka. Generations of professional and amateur Pakistani cricket players since the 1980s have been raised playing tape-ball cricket in their neighbourhood streets and grounds. Professional cricketers such as Saeed Anwar, Rashid Latif, Asif Mujtaba, Moin Khan and Basit Ali enjoy the medium and play regularly. Extensive enthusiasm for the medium has led to the institutionalisation of the tape ball in Pakistani cricket.\n\nTape balls are extensively decorated in different colours, and different kinds of electrical tapes and fibres are used to maximise their advantages.\n\nTape-ball cricket is considered an integral part of Pakistani cricket and sports culture, with virtually every cricket-playing youth being exposed to it in one form or another. The tape ball's ability to generate bounce and speed has encouraged and influenced Pakistan's fast bowling traditions, including pacemen such as Shoaib Akhtar. The ball also responds forcefully to powerful batting and stroke play, and has helped mould the pinch-hitting style of Shahid Afridi. Mohammed Amir was scouted during a tape-ball tournament when he was 13. \n\nAlthough not recognised by official cricket bodies, tape-ball cricket is receiving widespread popular, media and commercial support, especially in Pakistan. During festive seasons and the cricket-playing months of winter and spring, major tournaments are organised, often featuring as many as 200 teams representing corporations, clubs and neighbourhoods. The influential role of the tape ball on Pakistani cricket has won the attention and respect of cricketing experts, authorities and students of the game.\n\nIn 2005, hoping to capitalise on the enthusiasm created by England's win in the 2005 Ashes series, the London Community Cricket Association began organising tape ball cricket teams for children on estates in inner-city London, where a lack of playing fields has led to a decline in popularity for traditional cricket. The matches use a variant of the Twenty20 Cricket rules designed to make matches last a half-hour or less.\n\n\n"}

It is pricked with a fork prior to baking and cut smaller than a regular biscuit. The prepared dough is baked at for 20 minutes until tops are golden brown, but some bakers prefer a crisp, white biscuit that is baked with no browning.\n\nHow long the biscuits are beaten varies from one recipe to the next, from \"at least 15 minutes\" to \"30 to 45 minutes.\" The beating these biscuits undergo is severe: they are banged with a \"rolling pin, hammer, or side of an axe\"; or they are \"pounded with a blunt instrument...[even] a tire iron will do...Granny used to beat 'em with a musket\"; one book \"instructs the cook to 'use boys to do it'\"—that is, beat the biscuits vigorously \"at least 200 times.\" Besides ensuring the proper texture for the biscuit, \"this beating also serves to vent the cook's weekly accumulation of pent-up frustrations.\"\n\nThese biscuits were traditionally used in \"ham biscuits\", a traditional Southern canapé, where they are sliced horizontally and spread with butter, jelly, mustard and filled with pieces of country ham, or sopped up with gravy or syrup. They are sometimes considered \"Sunday biscuits\" and can be stored for several months in an airtight container. Beaten biscuits were once so popular that special machines, called biscuits brakes, were manufactured to knead the dough in home kitchens. A biscuit brake typically consists of a pair of steel rollers geared together and operated by a crank, mounted on a small table with a marble top and cast iron legs.\n\nDue to the amount of work required to make them, beaten biscuits are no longer popular.

They are used for the worship of deities in temples or at home; as an aid in meditation; used for the benefits given by their supposed occult powers based on Hindu astrology and tantric texts. They are also used for adornment of temple floors, due mainly to their aesthetic and symmetric qualities. Specific yantras are traditionally associated with specific deities.\n\nRepresentations of the yantra in India have been considered to date back to 11,000-10,000 years BP. The Baghor stone, found in an upper-paleolithic context in the Son River valley, is considered the earliest example by G.R. Sharma, who was involved in the excavation of the stone (it was dated to 25,000 - 20,000 B.P.). The triangular-shaped stone, which includes triangular engravings on one side, was found daubed in ochre, in what was considered a site related to worship. Worship of goddesses in that region was found to be practiced in a similar manner to the present day. Kenoyer, who was also involved in the excavation, considered it to be associated with Shakti.\n\nIn Rigvedic Sanskrit, it meant an instrument for restraining or fastening, a prop, support or barrier, etymologically from the root \"yam\" \"to sustain, support\" and the \"-tra\" suffix expressing instruments. The literal meaning is still evident in the medical terminology of Sushruta, where the term refers to blunt surgical instruments such as tweezers or a vice. The meaning of \"mystical or occult diagram\" arises in the medieval period (Kathasaritsagara, Pancharatra).\n\nMadhu Khanna in linking mantra, yantra, deva, and thought forms states:\n\nMantras, the Sanskrit syllables inscribed on yantras, are essentially \"thought forms\" representing divinities or cosmic powers, which exert their influence by means of sound-vibrations.\nYantras are usually associated with a particular deity and are used for specific benefits, such as: for meditation; protection from harmful influences; development of particular powers; attraction of wealth or success, etc. They are often used in daily ritual worship at home or in temples, and sometimes worn as a talisman.\n\nAs an aid to meditation, yantras represent the deity that is the object of meditation. These yantras emanate from the central point, the \"bindu\". The yantra typically has several geometric shapes radiating concentrically from the center, including triangles, circles, hexagons, octagons, and symbolic lotus petals. The outside often includes a square representing the four cardinal directions, with doors to each of them. A popular form is the Sri Chakra, or Sri Yantra, which represents the goddess in her form as Tripura Sundari. Sri Chakra also includes a representation of Shiva, and is designed to show the totality of creation and existence, along with the user's own unity with the cosmos.\n\nYantras can be on a flat surface or three dimensional. Yantras can be drawn or painted on paper, engraved on metal, or any flat surface. They tend to be smaller in size than the similar mandala, and traditionally use less color than mandalas.\n\nOccult yantras are used as good luck charms, to ward off evil, as preventative medicine, in exorcism, etc., by using their magical power. When used as a talisman, the yantra is seen to represent a deity who can be called on at will by the user. They are traditionally consecrated and energized by a priest, including the use of mantras which are closely associated to the specific deity and yantra. Practitioners believe that a yantra that is not energized with mantra is lifeless.\n\nGudrun Bühnemann classifies three general types of yantras based on their usage:\n\nA yantra comprises geometric shapes, images, and written mantra. Triangles and hexagrams are common, as are circles and lotuses of 4 to 1,000 petals. Saiva and Shakta yantras often feature the prongs of a trishula.\n\n\nYantra designs in modern times have deviated from the traditional patterns given in ancient texts and traditions. Designers in India and Nepal may copy design elements from Western imitations of yantras.\n\n\n"}

It is played with two standard decks of cards, including four jokers, for a total of 108 cards. The jokers and twos are wild.\n\nEach player is dealt thirteen cards. During each hand, the object is to complete the appointed run and kinds, and get rid of as many cards as possible. When one player gets rid of all of their cards, the cards remaining in the rest of the players hands score penalty points. The player who completes all twelve hands with the least points wins.\n\nAs in most rummy games, melds consist of either sets of equal cards, or runs of consecutive cards. Wild cards may be substituted for any number of cards in a set or run. There are twelve meld sets each player must complete as follows:\n\nIf a player is unable to complete the appointed hand, he must try again on the next hand.\n\nA set consists of cards of equal rank – for example three threes or five queens. In this variation, sets may contain two cards of the same suit; i.e., two 9 of hearts.\n\nA run consists of cards in sequence, the cards do not have to be in the same suit, such as 2-3-4-5 of hearts. Aces can be high (J-Q-K-A) or low (A-2-3-4) but not both (K-A-2-3).\n\nTwos and jokers are wild and can be used to represent any desired card.\n\nThe player to the left of the dealer begins, and the turn to play continues clockwise. A turn consists of drawing, melding and discarding.\n\nThis is an optional rule. When a player sees a card he or she likes then they can ask to cut in and take the card along with three additional cards from the top of the deck. It is up to the player whose turn it is, to allow this or to take the card themselves. That player must also check if any others want it left of the one whose turn it is until no players want it that will go before them. Any player may cut in at any time between a meld and the next players draw up to two times. If he loses count none=11 cards; one=14 cards; and 2 cut ins=17 cards.\n\nThere are two options:\n\nIf the player has already played their meld set, he must draw from the undealt stock cards.\n\nOnce the player has drawn, he may place his meld set down if he is able. On subsequent turns, players may only add to existing melds, as melds outside of the prescribed meld sets are not allowed. He can, however, add to another players' melds.\n\nThe final part of each player's turn is to discard one card from his hand face up onto the discard pile.\n\nThe objective is to meld or discard all of one's cards, and the play continues until one player manages to \"go out\" by getting rid of all the cards from their hand. He must always end his turn by discarding.\n\nWhen discarding, a player may not discard a card if it creates a meld, (run or a set). If an opponent notices the error prior to the next player picking up, that player is permitted to remove the set from the pile and place it with their other melds.\n\nAs soon as a player goes out, the hand is scored. The player who went out counts nothing for this hand. The opponents count the total value of the cards remaining in their hand. The value of the individual cards is a follows:\n\nThe value of their hand is added to their running total. The player that completes all twelve meld sets with the lowest score wins.\n\n"}

In modern \"keshi\" refers to a collectible miniature figure, often of a manga or anime character, made of coloured hard rubber. However, the word's reference has broadened beyond its etymological meaning, as keshi are made of several types of rubber, ranging in appearance from opaque matte to transparent. Also, some lines, such as the \"Cosmos Souls Keshi Gum\" (コスモスザウルス消しゴム, \"kosumosu saurusu keshi gomu\"), use plastic parts. Keshi figures are not necessarily based on Japanese comic book or TV series franchises, since there are keshi dedicated to video games (\"Super Mario\", \"Zelda\", etc.) and some western lines are based on local mythologies and popular culture. A similar product is often mistakenly thought be keshi, the pencil cap toy (ペンシル キャップ, \"penshiru kyappu\") which appeared around the same period.\n\nKeshi is a toy genre with Japanese roots but is not limited to Japanese manufacture nor Japanese culture as the keshi were sold and became popular all around the world in the last twenty years, and some keshi lines were made in Europe or in China and exported.\n\nThis toy genre appeared in Japan during the 1970s and became increasingly popular throughout the years.

Kimengumi, , Dr. Slump or even Kinnikuman keshis (known as Kinkeshi).\n\nThe first keshi exported outside Japan appeared in the late 1970s in Bonux packages, a Procter & Gamble washing powder released in France (and recently introduced in former USSR states such as Ukraine). The Bonux brand was launched with the \"cadeau Bonux\" (the Bonux present) concept, a small value mini toy hidden inside the powder. Some keshi were part of these packages, including a 10-figure series of the, then, famous Monchhichi (モンチッチ). A monkey character created in 1974 by Koichi Sekiguchi and part of the first large scale, successful, exported Japanese anime franchises. The Bonux Monchhichi figures were 4.4/4.8 cm tall, chibikeshi styled, and available in seven different gums.\n\nHowever the keshi phenomenon sped-up worldwide in the late 1980s, early 1990s, with a wave of gum toy lines named M.U.S.C.L.E. (Kinkeshi americanized), Fistful Of Monsters or Monster In My Pocket in the United States.\n\nThe same lines were also exported in Europe, sometimes under different names, e.g. M.U.S.C.L.E. became Exogini in Italy and Cosmix in France. These franchises are actually composite bootleg lines including Kinkeshi/M.U.S.C.L.E., N.I.N.J.A.S. and Fistful Of Monsters, in the very same collection. Though, licensed lines appeared in Europe, including BeastFormer localized as \"Les Dragonautes\" in France and Monster In My Pocket.\n\nAround the same period, Keshi lines were also marketed in South East Asia, including South Korea.\n\nIn Japan, Keshi are still popular in the 2000s (decade), and \"keshi days\" are often organized in Mandarake stores where collectors can sell and buy used keshis.\n\nBandai America has launched the M.U.S.C.L.E.'s series' sequel in the United States market only in 2003 as a 20th anniversary celebration of the original Kinkeshi (M.U.S.C.L.E.'s original name) line.

Some lines have special packages like the Exogini pyramid ships (20/1940) in Italy, or the 205-figure collector set released in Japan (Kinkeshi). Some keshi are offered in washing powder packages, crisps or cereals bags. Catalogue color leaflets are included in Japanese capsule keshi, showing the series figures. Such series are named \"PART\", or its Japanese equivalent \"パート\" (\"pāto\") and \"ぱと\" (\"pato\"), by Bandai and other brands.\n\nAlthough vending machines keshi are often considered as standard size, three different material are used, hard gum, plastic or gum w/plastic parts. Even though dark salmon matte color mini figures are the quickest types identified as keshi in western countries, due to the famous M.U.S.C.L.E. line, there are actually a wide variety of gum from matte to bright, from translucent to transparent, from white to black, including the deluxe painted types.\n\nDekakeshi (デカ消し) are big size keshi released by the Marukoshi company prior to Bandai's popular lines.\n\nThe standard keshi are 5/5.5 cm mini figures sold in transparent plastic capsules available in Bandai vending machines known as \"gachagacha\" (ガチャガチャ).\n\nChibikeshi (チビ消し) are mini size keshi released by Bandai.\n\nSDkeshi (SD消し) are Super Deformed mini size keshi released by Bandai.\n\nFull color keshi are deluxe, hand painted, keshi.

{"id": "6237119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6237119", "title": "Short ribs", "text": "Short ribs\n\nShort ribs are a cut of beef taken from the brisket, chuck, plate, or rib areas of beef cattle. They consist of a short portion of the rib bone, which is overlain by meat which varies in thickness. There are two major types of cuts: The \"flanken\", which is cut across the bone and leaves the bone just in length, and the \"English\", which is cut parallel to the bone and leaves the bone up to in length. English cut short ribs may be served individually, or three or four may be served connected to one another (a style known as the \"plate\"). Short ribs are popular in many international cuisines.\n\nMeatpacking executive Richard C. Banfield notes that the term \"short ribs\" comes from the fact that the cut of meat contains only a portion of each long beef rib.\n\nUsing American butcher's nomenclature, short ribs may be taken from the brisket, chuck, plate, or rib areas of beef cattle.\n\nThe \"serratus ventralis\" muscle defines the area in the beef carcass from where short ribs come, and is the preferred muscle tissue for short ribs. This muscle originates near the second rib, and covers most of the rib cage. In the chuck area (second through fifth ribs), the muscle is much thicker. Moving toward the rump, the \"serratus ventralis\" becomes less dense, and may not cover the entire rib. Outside of the chuck, the \"serratus ventralis\" covers the entire rib with a degree of thickness only in the plate area. Over ribs nine through 12, the \"serratus ventralis\" is too thin to properly create a true short rib, and meat here is usually turned into a \"Royal short rib\" or else stripped from the bone and used for ground beef.\n\nThe \"latissimus dorsi\" muscle lies atop the \"serratus ventralis\" muscle, and is separated from it by a layer of fat. This muscle is generally found in the chuck area and the upper portion (toward the spine) of the plate. It adds thickness to chuck and rib short ribs, but is less prized by chefs than the \"serratus ventralis\" muscle.\n\nChuck short ribs tend to be meatier than the other two types of ribs, but they are also tougher due to the more extensive connective tissues (collagen and reticulin) in them. Plate short ribs tend to be fattier than the other two types.\n\nShort ribs cut from the rib area near the spine (the dorsal area) are better known as \"back ribs\" or \"dinosaur ribs\". They consist of what remains of the rib in this area after the rib chop is removed. Due to the thinness of the \"serratus ventralis\" here, the meat on these ribs is generally intercostal muscle (e.g., the muscle between each rib).\n\nShort ribs, by definition, are not the entire length of rib. When the rib bone is cut into a length, left as a section of meat (a \"plate\") containing three or four ribs or cut into individual ribs with meat attached, the short rib is known as an \"English cut\". They may also be known as barbecue ribs, braising ribs, or fancy cut ribs. A section of short ribs from the plate (ribs six through eight, with their intercostal muscle) is known as a \"short plate\". Rib short ribs are almost always sold as a plate.\n\nWhen the carcass is cut across the bone to create strips of meat with multiple rib bones, the short rib is known as a \"flanken cut.\" These may also be known as crosscut ribs, Eastern European-style ribs, Hawaiian-style ribs, Jewish ribs, Korean-style ribs, or \"kosher ribs\". Flanken-cut short ribs incorporate at least two rib bones, and are often no more than thick.\n\nRetail meat shops often do not differentiate between short ribs which come from the brisket, chuck, plate, and rib. In the United States, short ribs from the plate are generally the least expensive cut, followed by medium-priced short ribs from the brisket and chuck, and premium-priced short ribs from the rib area.\n\nBeef short ribs are the equivalent of spare ribs in pork, with beef short ribs usually larger and meatier than pork spare ribs.\n\n\"Boneless\" short ribs are cut from either the chuck or plate, and consist of rib meat separated from the bone. \"Boneless country-style short ribs\", however, are not true short ribs. They are found primarily in the United States, and are cut from the chuck eye roll (serving as a less expensive alternative to rib steak).\n\nShort ribs are particularly popular in Chinese, Jewish, and Korean cooking.\n\nShort ribs generally require long periods of cooking in order to break down the connective tissues in the meat and make the meat tender. Methods of preparation include braising, stewing, and \"sous-vide\". Short ribs may also be barbecued, a popular method that subjects the beef to high heat in a relatively short period of time.\n\n\"Pot-au-feu\" is a classic French method of cooking short ribs. Flanken is a traditional Eastern European Jewish short rib dish, and serves as the origin of flanken cut of short ribs. Flanken-cut short ribs are boiled in broth with onions and other seasonings until the meat is very tender and the broth is rich. The stew is then served with grated horseradish.\n\nIn Korea, short lengths of rib are often further butchered by butterflying (or using an accordion cut) to unfurl the meat into a long ribbon trailing from the bone, or the meat can be removed from the bone entirely and cut into thin slices. Short ribs marinated in ganjang (a Korean soy sauce) and then rapidly grilled are known as \"galbi\". Short ribs prepared in the \"galbi\" style, but slow-cooked or steamed along with spices and vegetables is known as \"galbijjim\".\n\nA specific type of short rib dish which originated in Hawaii is known as Maui-style ribs. In this dish, flanken-cut ribs are marinated in soy sauce, brown sugar, and ginger, and then swiftly grilled.\n\nThe \"Royal short rib\" is a short rib dish prepared in Europe and the United States which uses ribs nine through 12. The membrane is removed from the inner side of an English-cut plate, and the plate sliced into its component ribs.

A year later, Jack Daniel's launched a national campaign to promote the drink. Mason subsequently filed suit in the Madison County Circuit Court, seeking over US$13 million in compensatory and punitive damages for misappropriating his recipe. The court ruled in Mason's favor but decided to award him no money. After the trial, the presiding judge offered to pay Mason one dollar out of his own pocket which Mason rejected. In \"Mason v.

Common fried onions are cooked by basic pan frying or sautéing of sliced onions. This produces a fairly soft cooked onion, which may brown some from a Maillard reaction, depending on the length of cooking and the temperature. The Philadelphia cheesesteak is a hot sandwich commonly served with sautéed onions, and they are half of the dish called liver and onions. In the Middle East Mujaddara is a dish made of lentils and rice topped with fried onions. In Indian cuisine, fried onions are one of the key ingredients for the rice dish called biryani.\n\nIf the much higher temperature, immersive, deep frying is used, this prepares the onions in a manner similar to that of French fried potatoes. Smaller and irregularly shaped (from being deep-fried until they are crunchy) onions are an integral part of the American dish Green bean casserole. Freshly made crisp fried onions may be used as garnishes in some restaurants. In Sweden and rest of Scandinavia, known as rostad lök/ristede løg/stekte løk, they are a staple garnish for hot dogs or Tunnbrödsrulle, served in local fast food restaurants or by street vendors (which are common in large cities such as Stockholm and Copenhagen). Large, often ring shaped batter coated deep-fried onions are often associated with fast food and casual dining. Examples include onion rings and blooming onion.\nAlso used in biriyani for layering and garnishing.\n\n"}

It receives its name from the \"cazuela\" (Spanish for cooking pot) in which it is cooked. The ingredients and preparation vary from region to region, but it is usually a mid-thick flavoured stock obtained from cooking several kinds of meats and vegetables mixed together.\n\nThe cazuela is a typical dish of Chile. The most common types are made of chicken or beef, but there are also other types made from pork and turkey.\n\nOne typical dish of Chilean cazuela contains a piece of meat (it can be a piece of rib or several pieces of bones, in the case of beef, or a leg of chicken), a potato, a piece of pumpkin, and the stock obtained from boiling all of them together. These are sometimes complemented with cooked rice (in the stock), small-sized noodles, green beans, celery, sliced carrots, garlic, cabbage, among others. In summer the cazuela is accompanied by a piece of sweetcorn, cooked apart or in the same stock.\n\nThe cazuela is typically eaten by consuming the liquid stock first, then eating the meat and larger vegetables (e.g. potatoes, large piece of squash or carrot) last. However, the meat and larger vegetables can also be sliced up within the liquid stock and can be eaten simultaneously with the liquid stock.\n\nThe Chilean cazuela is related to the \"olla podrida\", a colonial dish of similar characteristics, but it also shares roots with a Mapuche stock called \"korrü\".\n\nCazuela is a typical dish of the Amazonas Region in Peru. The dish is prepared and cooked differently in each province or district of Amazonas.\n\nIn Chachapoyas, cazuela is prepared by boiling a piece of hen, a good piece of meat and a good piece of sheep. Add some wild cabbage, rice, carrot, sweetcorn grains, and a glass of white wine.\n\nA few minutes before taking the saucepot out of the fire, add some milk and vermicelli noodles (also called cabello de ángel noodles). It is necessary to try that the cazuela has sufficient broth or juice to be able to be served as a soup.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, \"cazuela\" is a traditional pie usually made during the Christmas season. It is similar to a pumpkin pie but uses sweet potato, pumpkin, and coconut milk and usually contains no pie crust.\n\nIn southern Arizona, cazuela is frequently made with carne seca or machaca (two varieties of dried beef) with potatoes, garlic, green chiles, and herbs.\n\n"}

Some artifacts (e.g., use cases, class diagrams, and other Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, requirements and design documents) help describe the function, architecture, and design of software. Other artifacts are concerned with the process of development itself—such as project plans, business cases, and risk assessments.\n\nThe term \"artifact\" in connection with software development is largely associated with specific development methods or processes e.g., Unified Process. This usage of the term may have originated with those methods.\n\nBuild tools often refer to source code compiled for testing as an artifact, because the executable is necessary to carrying out the testing plan. Without the executable to test, the testing plan artifact is limited to non-execution based testing. In non-execution based testing, the artifacts are the walkthroughs, inspections and correctness proofs. On the other hand, execution based testing requires at minimum two artifacts: a test suite and the executable. An artifact occasionally may be used to refer to the released code (in the case of a code library) or released executable (in the case of a program) produced but the more common usage is in referring to the byproducts of software development rather than the product itself. Open source code libraries often contain a testing harness to allow contributors to ensure their changes do not cause regression bugs in the code library.\n\nMuch of what are considered artifacts is software documentation.\n\nIn end-user development an artifact is either an application or a complex data object that is created by an end-user without the need to know a general programming language. Artifacts describe automated behavior or control sequences, such as database requests or grammar rules, or user-generated content.\n\nArtifacts vary in their maintainability. Maintainability is primarily affected by the role the artifact fulfills. The role can be either practical or symbolic. In the earliest stages of software development, artifacts may be created by the design team to serve a symbolic role to show the project sponsor how serious the contractor is about meeting the project's needs. Symbolic artifacts often convey information poorly, but are impressive-looking. Symbolic artifacts are sometimes referred to in the information architecture industry as Illuminated Scrolls, because the decorations do nothing to enhance understanding. Generally speaking, Illuminated Scrolls are also considered unmaintainable due to the diligence it requires to preserve the symbolic quality. For this reason, once Illuminated Scrolls are shown to the project sponsor and approved, they are replaced by artifacts which serve a practical role. Practical artifacts usually need to be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, and, as such, are generally highly maintainable.\n\nArtifacts are significant from a project management perspective as deliverables. The deliverables of a software project are likely to be the same as its artifacts with the addition of the software itself.\n\nThe sense of artifacts as byproducts is similar to the use of the term \"artifact\" in science to refer to something that arises from the process in hand rather than the issue itself, i.e., a result of interest that stems from the means rather than the end.\n\nTo collect, organize and manage artifacts, a Software development folder may be utilized.\n\n// POST: api/Todo\n[HttpPost]\npublic async Task<ActionResult<TodoItem» PostTodoItem(TodoItem item)\n\n\n"}

It was invented by Japanese-American businesswoman and activist Frances Hashimoto.\n\nMochi ice cream is a small, round confection consisting of a soft, pounded sticky rice dumpling (mochi) formed around an ice cream filling. The ice cream flavors the confection while the mochi adds sweetness and texture. The traditional Ice cream flavors used are vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. Other flavors, such as Kona coffee, plum wine, green tea, and red bean, are also widely used. Mochi can also be flavored as a complement to the ice cream filling. When making mochi, it is dusted with either potato or cornstarch to keep it from sticking while being formed and handled.\n\nJapanese daifuku and manjū are the predecessors to mochi ice cream, commonly featuring adzuki bean filling. Due to the temperature and consistency of mochi and ice cream, both components must be modified. This is to achieve the right viscosity that will remain constant regardless of changes in temperature.\n\nAn early predecessor form of the dessert was originally produced by Lotte, as Yukimi Daifuku in 1981. The company first made the product by using a rice starch instead of sticky rice and a rice milk instead of real ice cream.\n\nFrances Hashimoto, the former president and CEO of Mikawaya, is credited as the inventor of mochi ice cream. Hashimoto's husband, Joel Friedman, conceived the idea of taking small orbs of ice cream and wrapping them in a Japanese traditional mochi rice cake. Frances Hashimoto expanded on her husband's idea, inventing the fusion dessert now popular in the United States and elsewhere. Hashimoto introduced seven flavors in the mochi product line.\n\nMikawaya began production of mochi ice cream in the United States in 1993. Research and development took over a decade to evolve into the mass production form used today, due to the complex interactions of the ingredients. Trial and error was used in order to successfully pull the delicate mochi dough over the ice cream without leaving a sodden mess. Friedman explained that in order to conduct production of the ice cream, experts ranging from construction to microbiology were brought in to perfect the state-of-the-art production building.\n\nMikawaya debuted their Mochi Ice Cream in Hawaii in 1994. The frozen treat was so popular, it captured 15% of the novelty frozen treat market during its first four months.\n\n\n"}

It was introduced to the U.S. through Charleston, Savannah, New York and Philadelphia, but has origins in India. The dish was once included in the United States military Meal, Ready-to-Eat packs, in honor of it being a favorite dish of George S. Patton.\n\nIt has also appeared on television shows in both the United States and in the United Kingdom, with chefs Bobby Flay, Atul Kochhar and Cyrus Todiwala all cooking the dish. Todiwala served his version to Queen Elizabeth II as part of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nIn its basic form, country captain is a mild stew made with browned chicken pieces, onions, and curry powder. Almonds and golden raisins or zante currants are usually added. Many versions also call for tomatoes, garlic, and bell peppers. The dish is served over white rice. With the exception of the rice, it is meant to be cooked all in the same pot. Chef Mamrej Khan has referred to the dish as one of the first fusion dishes to be developed, making it part of the Anglo-Indian cuisine.\n\nCountry captain originated in India as a simple spatchcock poultry or game recipe involving onions and curry and possibly enjoyed by British officers. One theory is that an early 19th-century British sea captain, possibly from the East India Company, working in the spice trade introduced it to the American South via the port of Savannah. The dish remains popular amongst the communities in Mumbai, India. The \"country\" part of the dish's name dates from when the term referred to things of Indian origin instead of British, and so the term \"country captain\" would have meant a captain of Indian origin, a trader along the coasts of India. Others claim that the word \"captain\" in the title is simply a corruption of the word \"capon\".\n\nIn 1991, \"New York Times\" columnist Molly O’Neill researched the origin of the dish known as country captain, which had been a steady feature in southern cookbooks since the 1950s. Working with Cecily Brownstone, they discovered that the dish originally published in the United States in the pages of \"Miss Leslie’s New Cookery Book\" published in Philadelphia in 1857. The recipe required a \"fine full-grown fowl\". It also appeared in the kitchens of Alessandro Filippini, who was a chef with a restaurant on Wall Street in the 18th century.\n\nFans of the dish have included Franklin D. Roosevelt, who introduced it to George S. Patton. It was Patton's love for the dish which subsequently resulted in it being added in his honor to the U.S. Army's Meal, Ready-to-Eat field rations in 2000. A variety of Southern chefs have recipes for the dish, including Paul Prudhomme, Paula Deen and Emeril Lagasse. The dish was featured on an episode of \"Throwdown! with Bobby Flay\" in season 6 guest-starring Matt and Ted Lee. It also appeared on the BBC One cooking show, \"Saturday Kitchen\", with chef Atul Kochhar cooking the regular chicken and rice version of the dish.\n\nChef Cyrus Todiwala cooked a variation of country captain on \"Saturday Kitchen\". His version was similar to Shepherd's Pie, in that the meat was baked under a layer of potato. He had previously cooked the dish for Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh at Krishna Avanti Primary School in Harrow as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. That version of the dish used rare breed lamb from the Orkney Islands which had been fed on seaweed. The dish is also now on the menu of Todiwala's London restaurant, Café Spice Namasté.\n\n"}

Some people also eat it with fruit or black pepper and cream. Prior to the now-popular use of baking soda, clabber was used as a quick leavener in baking. Due to its stability, clabbered milk has been popular in areas without access to steady refrigeration.\n\nClabber was brought to the South by the Ulster Scots who settled in the Appalachian Mountains. Clabber is still sometimes referred to as \"bonny clabber\" (originally \"bainne clábair\", from Irish \"bainne\" — milk, and \"clábair\" — sour milk). Clabber passed into Scots and Hiberno-English dialects meaning wet, gooey mud, though it is commonly used now in the noun form to refer to the food or in the verb form \"to curdle\". \n\nClabber was sometimes served with a specialized spoon. This is a serving utensil formed with the handle made at a 90 degree angle from the spoon bowl, to accommodate the manner in which clabber had to be ladled out of the container in which it formed.\n\nWith the rise of pasteurization the making of clabber virtually stopped, except on farms that had easy access to unprocessed cow's milk. A somewhat similar food can be made from pasteurized milk by adding a couple of tablespoons of commercial buttermilk or sour milk to a glass of milk.\n\nSimilar foods are the South African \"amasi\", German \"Dickmilch\" (thick milk), Scandinavian \"filmjölk\", and Russian \"prostokvasha\".\n\n"}

Michel Rouche succinctly traced the word's development, especially in the West: \"The term \"schola\", which once referred to the imperial guard, came to be applied in turn to a train of warrior-servants who waited on the king, to the group of clergymen who waited on the bishop, to the monks of a monastery, and ultimately to a choral society; it did not mean 'school' before the ninth century.\"\n\nWhile the singular \"schola\" still was used to refer to learning of singing and a mode of writing, the plural had an independent meaning. Next to the old kind of school, the Scholae Palatinae, established by Constantine the Great as a replacement to the Praetorian Guard, was the training center of the imperial palace guard. It remained based at Constantinople, eventually declining to a purely ceremonial role.

Different variants of this dish are especially common in Ashkenazi Jewish and Finnish cuisine. Some varieties are also known in Russian and Polish cuisine.\n\nAccording to Gil Marks, the German name points to the possible Germanic origin of this dish. William Pokhlyobkin describes it as an originally East Prussian hot appetizer which was made of fried herring. The dish was adopted and brought eastwards by Ashkenazi Jews which transformed it into a cold appetizer, a pâté made of chopped brined herring. While the name \"forshmak\" became common in Ukraine (, ), Polish and Lithuanian Jews usually called it gehakte herring (\"chopped herring\").\n\nTraditional recipes include chopped hard-boiled egg, onion and grated fresh apple. Sometimes potatoes are also added. The appetizer is usually served as a salad or as a spread on bread, crackers or kichlach (cookies). It may also be eaten for breakfast or as a main course, usually with boiled potatoes.\n\nAlthough nowadays vorschmack is mainly associated with Jewish cuisine in Russia, historically different versions of this dish () were known there. These were usually hot zakuski (appetizers) or breakfast dishes. \"A Gift to Young Housewives\", a classical Russian cookbook by Elena Molokhovets, provides three recipes of hot vorschmack in its first edition (1861) and further variants were added in subsequent editions. In one recipe, meat (veal or beef), herring, white bread and onions are minced, mixed with smetana (sour cream) or cream and baked. Other recipes include only herring (without meat), as well as other ingredients, such as potatoes, eggs and apples. Even more elaborate recipes with further details on cooking techniques are given in another classical Russian cookery textbook, \"The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art\" (1899–1916) by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva. It was in particular proposed to place the mixture of minced ingredients inside a kalach, cover it with grated cheese and bake it au gratin. Similar recipes also appear in \"Cookery\" (1955), a major cookbook of Soviet cuisine.\n\nAs a cold pâté or a hot baked appetizer, various recipes of \"forszmak\" (the same pronunciation) are found in old Polish cookery. The recipes are similar to the Russian ones described above. Another variety, a hot pot dish also named \"forszmak\" is known in East Poland (Lublin region), usually made of chicken and cucumbers.\n\nIn Finnish cuisine, vorschmack is usually prepared out of ground meat, anchovies or herring and onions. The dish is usually garnished with potatoes, pickles and smetana (sour cream). Snaps is usually served in combination with eating vorschmack. Some recipes include cognac.\n\nThere are several stories regarding the origin of the dish, but it has become a traditional Finnish dish as it was one of the favourite appetizers of the Finnish statesman, war hero and gourmand Marshall Gustaf Mannerheim. Some sources say Mannerheim brought the dish to Finland from Poland or Russia, but there have not been any definite sources for these claims.\n\nThe restaurant Savoy at the top floor of one of the buildings around the Esplanadi in central Helsinki is famous for its vorschmack. The restaurant used to be frequented by Mannerheim and Mannerheim’s table at the Savoy was always reserved and, out of respect, no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Savoy still today keeps a similar style decor and menu as in the days of Mannerheim.\n\n"}

Before actually boiling it, the octopus' tentacles are dipped in and out of the boiling water three times, held by its head. The objective of this operation is to curl the tips of the tentacles. The tentacles are preferred over the head, which sometimes is discarded. After the octopus has been boiled, it is trimmed with scissors, sprinkled with coarse salt and both sweet and spicy paprika (known in Galicia as pemento and pemento picante) and drizzled with olive oil. The optimal cooking point is the one in which octopus is not rubbery but not overcooked either, similarly to the al dente concept in Italian pasta cooking. This is achieved after approximately a 40-90 minutes boil, provided that the octopus is left to rest for a further 20 minutes inside the boiled water away from the fire.\n\nThe dish is traditionally served on wooden plates and bread. Tradition dictates that drinking water should not accompany octopus, so the dish is usually accompanied by young Galician red wine.\n\nTraditionally, this diatopic use of octopus was facilitated by its inland availability as stockfish. In the last decades, frozen octopus has replaced dried octopus. Fresh octopus is not so frequently used nowadays either, as it is necessary to pound it heavily before cooking to avoid the dish becoming rubbery. This procedure can be skipped after freezing, which, unlike other seafood, does not alter the organoleptic properties of octopus.\n\nThe provinces of Ourense and Lugo have a reputation for good octopus cooking. Fair style octopus is the totemic food of the patron saint festivities of Lugo (San Froilán). Some Galician cooks specialize in this dish. They are usually women, known by the name polbeiras (Galician name). After the modern decline of traditional rural fairs, many polberías (octopus restaurants, by its Galician name) have sprouted across the Galician geography. Polbeiras tend to be rough-and-ready eateries, rather than refined restaurants.\n\n\n"}

But it is known that by the second half of the 19th century, sandesh commonly referred to the chhena-based sweet.

The simplest kind of sandesh in Bengal is the makha sandesh (makha = kneaded). It is prepared by tossing the chhena lightly with sugar over low heat. The sandesh is essentially hot, sweetened chhana. When shaped into balls, it is called kanchagolla (kancha = raw; golla = ball).

The root \"seb-\" () is connected to danger and flight, and thus the sense of reverence originally described fear of the gods.\n\nThe word was used in Classical Greece where it meant behaving as tradition dictates in one's social relationships and towards the gods. One demonstrates eusebeia to the gods by performing the customary acts of respect (festivals, prayers, sacrifices, public devotions). By extension one honors the gods by showing proper respect to elders, masters, rulers and everything under the protection of the gods.\n\nFor Platonists, \"Eusebeia\" meant \"right conduct in regard to the gods\". For the Stoics, \"knowledge of how God should be worshiped\".\n\nIn ancient Greek religion and myth the concept of Eusebeia is anthropomorphized as the \"daimon\" of piety, loyalty, duty and filial respect. According to one source, her husband is Nomos (Law), and their daughter is Dike, goddess of justice and fair judgment. In other tellings, Dike is the daughter of the god Zeus and/or the goddess Themis (Order). The Roman equivalent is Pietas.\n\nThe Indian emperor Ashoka in his 250 BCE Edicts used the word \"eusebeia\" as a Greek translation for the central Buddhist and Hindu concept of \"dharma\" in the Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription.\n\n\"Eusebeia\" enters the New Testament in later writings, where it is typically translated as \"godliness,\" a vague translation that reflects uncertainty about its relevant meaning in the New Testament. For example, \"Divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness (eusébeia), through the true (full, personal, experiential) knowledge of Him Who called us by His own glory and excellence\" (2 Pet 1:3) Peter.

It has a very strong smell, which may upset those who are not accustomed to it. The hanging process covers three stages, or \"hjeldene\", each causing the meat to have different consistencies, smells and tastes. The first, \"visnaður\", occurs after just a few days, but lamb and mutton are not eaten after such a short period. The second stage, \"ræstur\", is of less predictable length, and provides dried meat suitable for eating without cooking. In reaching the final stage, \"turrur\", cold weather can on occasion virtually eliminate the typical smell with a resulting weakening of taste. If, however, the weather is warm and wet during the first period, the fermentation process can cause the meat to decay, giving it too strong a taste. There can therefore be variations in taste from year to year, but this is not usually a problem. A much more serious problem is infestation by flies. For this reason, the drying sheds used to be placed next to streams or the sea in order to diminish the arrival of flies. \n\nWhen the \"skerpikjøt\" is ready, it is cut into thin slices and eaten on rye bread in the form of an open faced sandwich.\n\n"}

It is a fried food made of small balls of yeast dough coated with granulated sugar. They were first made by inhabitants of the Madeira islands. Traditional malasadas contain neither holes nor fillings, but some varieties of malasadas are filled with flavored cream or other fillings. Malasadas are eaten especially on Mardi Gras - the day before Ash Wednesday.\n\nIn Madeira, and in the Azores, malasadas are eaten mainly on \"Terça-feira Gorda\" (“Fat Tuesday” in English; \"Mardi Gras\" in French) which is also the day before Lent begins, and of the Carnival of Madeira. The reason for making malasadas was to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lent (much in the same way the tradition of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom originated on Shrove Tuesday), malasadas are sold alongside the Carnival of Madeira today. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugarcane plantations of the 19th century, the resident Catholic Portuguese (mostly from Madeira and the Azores) workers used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of \"malasadas\".\n\nIn 1878, Portuguese laborers from Madeira and the Azores came to Hawaii to work in the plantations. These immigrants brought their traditional foods with them, including a fried dough pastry called the \"malasada.\" Today there are numerous bakeries in the Hawaiian islands specializing in malasadas.\n\nOn the East Coast, in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts, there is also a high population of Portuguese-Americans. Festivals in towns such as New Bedford and Fall River will often serve Portuguese cuisine, including Malasadas.\n\nMardi Gras (\"Fat Tuesday\"), the day before Lent, is Malasada day in Hawaii. Being predominantly Catholic, Portuguese immigrants would need to use up all their butter and sugar prior to Lent. They did so by making large batches of malasadas, which they would subsequently share with friends from all the other ethnic groups in the plantation camps.\n\nIn the United States, malasadas are cooked in many Portuguese or Portuguese descendant homes on Fat Tuesday. It is a tradition where the older children take the warm doughnuts and roll them in the sugar while the eldest woman — mother or grandmother — cooks them. \n\n\n(2010) Patrick Andrews - \"Pioneering the Malasada\" Queensland, Australia. 2010\n\n"}

Horowitz already owned molds to produce Rubik's Cubes and was able to use them to produce his new design. Mass production is completed in China by American Classic Toy Inc, a company belonging to Horowitz. The product is sold in the United States in retailers such as Barnes & Noble and FAO Schwarz. There are 12 types of Sudoku Cube, which differ in difficulty and are aimed at different age ranges.\n\nIn a standard Rubik's Cube, the player must match up colours on each side of the cube. In the Sudoku Cube, the player must place the numbers one to nine on each side with no repetition. This is achieved by rotating the sides of the cube. Variations of the Sudoku Cube are the Sudokube and Roxdoku, as well as cubes with 4×4×4 squares instead of the normal 3×3×3. This cube is very difficult compared to other cubes because as well as requiring basic knowledge of a Rubik's cube, the player must also know basic sudoku concepts. Any wrong move could put the puzzle in jeopardy.\n\n3-D programming languages such as VPython can be used to create simulations of a Sudoku Cube. Such simulations can offer features such as scaling the sudokube (to create 4×4×4 or 5×5×5 puzzles), saving, resetting, undoing, and the option to design one's own sudokube patterns.\n\n"}

The contemporary use of the word in Egyptian Arabic is to mean \"garbage collectors\". In cultural contexts, the word refers to teenagers and adults who have served as Cairo's informal garbage collectors since approximately the 1940s. The Zabbaleen (singular: ', ) are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means \"pig-pen operators.\" The word ' came from the Egyptian Arabic word ' (, ) which means \"garbage\".\n\nSpread out among seven different settlements scattered in the Greater Cairo Urban Region, the Zabbaleen population is between 50,000 and 70,000. The largest settlement is Mokattam village, nicknamed \"Garbage City,\" located at the foot of the Mokattam Mountains, next to Manshiyat Naser. The Zabbaleen community in Mokattam Village has a population of around 20,000 to 30,000, over 90 percent of which are Coptic Christians.\n\nFor several generations, the Zabbaleen supported themselves by collecting trash door-to-door from the residents of Cairo for nearly no charge. Notably, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect, whereas most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.\n\nThe Zabbaleen use donkey-pulled carts and pick-up trucks to transport the garbage that they collect from the residents of Cairo, transport the garbage to their homes in Mokattam Village, sort the garbage there, and then sell the sorted garbage to middlemen or create new materials from their recycled garbage. The living situation for the Zabbaleen is poor, especially since they live amongst the trash that they sort in their village and with the pigs to which they feed their organic waste. Nevertheless, the Zabbaleen have formed a strong and tight-knit community. However, their existence and way of life has come under threat after the Cairo municipal authorities’ decision in 2003 to award annual contracts of $50 million to three multinational garbage disposal companies.\n\nThe government authorities do not compensate the Zabbaleen for these changes, and as a result, the takeover of waste collection threatens the socio-economic sustainability of the Zabbaleen community. More recently, the Zabbaleen have faced another challenge when the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry ordered the culling of all pigs in April 2009, in response to national fears over the possible spread of H1N1 influenza.\n\nThis governmental decision poses a major setback to the Zabbaleen because pigs are an essential component to their recycling and sorting system, in which the pigs eat all of the organic waste. Immediately after the culling of pigs, observers have noticed a visible increase of trash piles and piles of rotting food on the streets of Cairo. There are also worries that the Egyptian government is seeking to remove the Mokattam village entirely and relocate the Zabbaleen further outside of Cairo by a further 25 km, to a 50-feddan plot (1 feddan = ) in Cairo's eastern desert settlement of Katameya.\n\nAround the 1910s, a group of Muslim migrants from the Dakhla oasis in the Western desert of Egypt relocated to Cairo in an area known as Bab El Bahr, which is situated between Attaba and Ramses square in downtown Cairo. These people are known as the Wahiya (singular: wahi), which means people of the oasis. The Wahiya assumed the sole responsibility for the collection and disposal of Cairo's household waste under the framework of contracts with building owners in Cairo. In this system, the Wahiya paid the owners of buildings an initial sum and then collected monthly fees from the tenants for their services.\n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, there was a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The descendants of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry at the foot of the Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect.\n\nPrior to the migration of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, as a source of energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with the migration of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen. Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect the refuse themselves using their own donkey carts.\n\nTherefore, the Zabbaleen can be distinguished from the Wahiya in at least two significant ways.\n\nFirst, the Wahiya retained control over the access and collection rights to the monthly fees paid by the residents, whereas the Zabbaleen usually do not have a share in the monthly fees paid by residents. In fact, the Zabbaleen are often obliged to pay the Wahiya in order to gain access to the waste garbage. However, what the Zabbaleen do acquire are the rights to the refuse itself. Hence, the relationship between the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen was hierarchically constituted. The Wahiya acted as the middlemen between the Zabbaleen and Cairo's households. Quoting Assaad, \"The wahiya assume overall responsibility for regular removal of the wastes \"vis-à-vis\" residents and building owners and are responsible for collection of the wastes from individual dwelling units to the street level. The Zabbaleen, on the other hand, are responsible for the haulage and disposal of the wastes.\"\nSecond, the Zabbaleen are the group that actually collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, an important component of their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries. Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo's municipal solid waste (MSW). In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades.\n\nThe municipal authorities grew increasingly intolerant of the Zabbaleen's donkey carts, which, according to Assaad, were considered an eyesore and a traffic hazard by the government. This was precisely in the neighborhoods that were being more fully served given Cairo's narrow, winding streets that are not wide-enough for large garbage trucks. Regardless, in the early 1990s, according to Fahmi & Sutton, the garbage collectors had to comply with the municipality's requirements to use motorized trucks, rather than donkey carts, as the authorities introduced a system of mechanization to transport solid waste. Because the Zabbaleen were required to accommodate to these new requirements for a mechanized system without any government support, including technical, financial, or educational support, they resorted to the selling of small plots of land back in their ancestral villages, use of personal savings, or credit loans to acquire the necessary capital to purchase the trucks. According to Fahmi, within the EPC, the Wahiya conducted administration, marketed the company's services, collected the fees from tenants, and supervised service deliveries. On the other end, the Zabbaleen, \"many of whom might otherwise have been homeless and without employment, collected and transported the waste.\" In more recent years, as the Zabbaleen became more involved in the work, some received a minimal fee from the Wahiya.\n\nThere are seven main settlements, in which the Zabbaleen reside in the Greater Cairo Urban Region: Ein El Sira, Moatamdia, El Bargil, Tora, Ezbet el Nakhl, Helwan, and Mokattam. Due to urban expansion, most of these 7 settlements have been moved by municipal authorities to more peripheral locations. The number of Zabbaleen living in these areas total to about 60,000-70,000. Of these settlements, Mokattam, also often known as Garbage City, east of Cairo, is the largest settlement, situated at the foot of Mokattam mountain, with approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The Zabbaleen Settlement of Mokattam was created as a result of a series of evictions from the Imbaba area located in the Giza governorate, notably when the Zabbaleen were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970.\n\nAlthough Mokattam village is relatively close to the center of Cairo, it is very inaccessible because it is situated on a plateau surrounded by the cliffs of the Mokattam hills on one side and by the Manshiet Nasser squatter settlement on the other side. Vehicular access to the Zabbaleen Mokattam is possible only through three entrances, two of which are accessible only by crossing through the crowded, narrow, and steep streets of Manshiet Nasser. Because of the high congestion and road traffic, conflicts between the residents of the Manshiet Nasser settlement and the Zabbaleen, who need to haul their donkey carts loaded with garbage through the streets of Manshiet Nasser have often broken out. Occasionally, these conflicts took on religious overtones, as the inhabitants of the Manshiet Nasser settlement are mostly Muslims, whereas the inhabitants of the Mokattam settlement are mostly Coptic Christians.\n\nMokattam village is situated at the foot of the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.\n\nThe living conditions in Mokattam Village, and the other Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, “the streets were so stacked with heaps of assorted refuse that some of them could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.” There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from “high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.” In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the living conditions of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors.\n\nThe Zabbaleen community is characterized by both low health and high rates of disease, especially those related to their garbage collecting activities. According to Assad, \"reported infant mortality rates, particularly from tetanus, were extremely high. In 1981, infant mortality was estimated at about 240 deaths per thousand births (EQI Report #3, 1981: 36).\" This infant mortality rate dropped to 117 per thousand in 1991, but the infant mortality rate in the Mokattam community is still substantially higher than the average infant mortality rate of Cairo for the 1990-95 period, which was 45.6 per thousand.\n\nEgypt is a Muslim-majority country. However, over 90 percent of the Zabbaleen community in the Mokattam village are Coptic Christians. Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\", many people in the Zabbaleen village say that even if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because they are happy to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion.\n\nThe local Coptic Church in Mokattam Village was established in 1975. After the establishment of the church, the Zabbaleen felt more secure in their location and only then began to use more permanent building materials, such as stone and bricks, for their homes. Given their previous experience of eviction from Giza in 1970, the Zabbaleen had lived in temporary tin huts up till that point. In 1976, a large fire broke out in Manshiyat Nasir, which led to the beginning of the construction of the first church below the Mokattam mountain on a site of 1,000 square meters. More churches have been built into the caves found in Mokattam. Currently, there are seven cave churches hidden among the caves of Mokattam Mountain. The Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner is the largest and it has an amphitheater with a seating capacity of 20,000. This church is the largest church in the Middle East. It is named after the Coptic Saint, Simon the Tanner, who lived at the end of the 10th century, when Egypt was ruled by the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Al-Muizz Lideenillah. Simon the Tanner is the Coptic Saint who is associated with the legend of the moving of the Mokattam Mountain. Adjacent churches to the Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner include the St. Bola's Church, St. Marks Church, and St. Simon the Tanner's Hall. The cave churches of Mokattam are also a point of interest for many tourists visiting Cairo.\n\nMany sources state that the Zabbaleen have created one of the most efficient recycling systems in the world, which recycles up to 80 percent of all the waste that they collect. In contrast, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. According to Fahmi, 2005, \"it was estimated that, in 1997, the Zabbaleen informally handled one-third of the garbage of Cairo’s 14 million people, mainly that from poorer districts,\" meaning that the Zabbaleen collected up to 3,000 tons of garbage every day. The Zabbaleen are able to recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect through their family-run micro-enterprises that generate jobs, including those for production of handmade crafts from rags and paper, and incomes from some 40,000 people. In fact, according to Fahmi, \"in the mid-1990s, nearly 700 Zabbaleen families owned collection enterprises, 200 owned and operated small- and medium-scale recycling enterprises, and 120 owned trading enterprises, in addition to maintenance workshops and community-based service businesses.\" What is distinctive about the Zabbaleen from many other urban informal waste collecting-groups that scavenge trash for useful products is that the Zabbaleen invest heavily in their tools and know-how for recycling. These Zabbaleen micro-entrepreneurs have invested \"an estimated 2.1 million Egyptian pounds (LE) (US $ 1⁄4 LE 6.19 -May 2004 rates) in trucks, plastic granulators, paper compactors, cloth grinders, aluminium smelters, and tin processors.\" By investing in such infrastructure, the Zabbaleen continually upgraded and enhanced their methods of recycling plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and fabrics. Thus, the city of Cairo and its administration had been able to manage its solid waste at almost no cost to the municipal administration because of such efforts by the Zabbaleen. Hence, the income that the Zabbaleen generate is mainly derived from their recycling and sorting activities, not from the minimal fees (LE 2-4) that they collect from residents.\n\nThere is a gender division of labor in the process of collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour.\n\nWhen the men return to the village with the collected trash, usually their families are waiting for them so that they can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.\n\nThe initial and very integral step of sorting the trash is the responsibility of Zabbaleen community members who own pigs. The pigs are fed the organic waste. After the organic waste has been eaten by the pigs, the rest of the trash is sorted into different categories such, as PT plastic, paper, cans, etc. Thus, as Engi Wassef, the director of \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\" notes, \"One of the reasons why Coptic Christians are given a kind of monopoly status on the garbage collection and sorting system is because the Muslim religion does not allow for breeding or eating or living near pigs. It's considered a dirty animal.\"\n\nIn addition to their use in sorting out organic waste, pigs are an important source of income. After the pigs have grown, the Zabbaleen sell the pig-meat to large tourist facilities. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \"Hitherto, the Zabbaleen claimed to collect 6,000 tons of MSW a day, of which 60% was food waste and organic garbage which their pigs consume. Every 6 months, the waste collectors sell adult pigs, 5 to 15 pigs to a trader for LE 7 per kilogram (US$ 1.25 per kilogram). The trader then takes pigs to the slaughterhouses, where a kilogram is sold for LE 30–35 (US$ 5–6.25). The waste collectors can earn around LE 450 (US$ 80) per pig.\"\n\nAfter the sorting of materials is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, in the creation of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\", PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, is one of the most highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re-sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables.\n\nThe official website of the documentary \"Garbage Dreams\" states that, \"Far ahead of any modern 'Green' initiatives, the Zabbaleen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect.\" By comparison, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. After the takeover of the municipal waste collection, the three private companies, two from Spain and one from Italy, that were awarded with contracts to dispose of Cairo's trash were only required to recycled 20 percent of the trash that they collect. The rest of the trash that foreign companies do not recycle are placed into new landfills. The efficiency and environmental-friendliness of the Zabbaleen \"waste collection and recycling system received major world recognition and approval at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.\" The Mega-Cities Project sought to encourage the Zabbaleen system of waste collection and recycling as a model to be encouraged in other developing world cities such as Manila and Mumbai. The Zabbaleen waste collection system has received international funding from the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and Oxfam for specific projects to upgrade and improve the recycling of solid waste.\n\nIn 2003, the government of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection, a domestic company was also awarded with contracts. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when the government agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx for the treatment of one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than what the government had previously paid before for its municipal waste management.\n\nSignificantly, the foreign companies, despite the large value of their contracts, are only required to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills. In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of all the MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places. Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more for what seemed to be a more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly bill for garbage collection that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption. Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, \"residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground.\"\n\nThe subcontracting of MSW collection to foreign companies had an immediate negative impact upon the Zabbaleen community as documented in Mai Iskander's film, Garbage Dreams. Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was the basis of their recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary Garbage Dreams, Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, \"The city contracted with foreign waste disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, \"You need to modernize your ways.\" This was all done behind our backs. \"we're replacing you with the companies.\" So we can be like the developed countries.\" In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the mechanized equipment of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations. Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them. This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \"while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50–$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month.\" One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US $1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day.\n\nIn April 2009, the first cases of the H1N1 influenza were found in Mexico. By the end of that month, it was estimated that up to 169 people died due to the epidemic.\nAll of the deaths, except for one, occurred in Mexico. Egypt responded to this outbreak of H1N1 by ordering the culling of its swine population, an act which had a devastating impact on the livelihood of 70,000 Zabbaleen families. This decision was made not by the Health Ministry, but directly by the Parliament. International organizations, including the United Nations criticized the Egyptian government for its decision. Egypt was the only country in the world to take such a drastic decision as to cull an estimated 300,000 pigs. This decision was made despite the general agreement that H1N1 is not transmitted by pigs. Furthermore, there were no cases of swine flu found in Egypt during the time when the pig cull was executed. The actual slaughter of the pigs was ordered by the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry in April 2009. Although government authorities stated that the slaughtering itself was humane, and in accordance with Islamic law, witnesses testify a lot of cruelty and violence in the culling. According to Slackman, \"Piglets were documented being stabbed and tossed into piles, large pigs beaten with metal rods, their carcasses dumped in the sand.\" H1N1 influenza was officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in June 2009. The pandemic was then declared to be officially over by the World Health Organization on August 10, 2010.\n\nWhen first ordering the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted that it was a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, it was part of a plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, \"We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life.\" In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, \"The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that the government wants to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork.\" In another New York Times article, Audi writes, \"Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically.\" According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, \"The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt.\" In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, \"Marina of the Zabbaleen\". Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: \"The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses.\"\n\nThe pig cull negatively affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, they are a vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets. According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, because without the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, because there was no place to put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work.\n\nAnother negative effect of the pig cull on the Zabbaleen was the loss of the economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately 80 USD) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, \"The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200).\" The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen.\n\nMany observers noticed an immediate increase in piles of trash on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. Because in the Zabbaleen system of recycling, it is the pigs who initially eat the organic waste, the pig cull had a negative effect on the cleanliness of Cairo's streets. According to Khalil in an article by Al Masry Al Youm, \"The elimination of the pigs prompted more trash than usual to immediately start clogging the streets of the capital.\" In a New York Times article from September 2009, Slackman states that the Egyptian government was warned before its actual execution that the pig cull, if executed, \"the city would be overwhelmed with trash.\" Slackman notes that after the pig cull, \"rotting food piles up on the streets of middle-class neighborhoods like Heliopolis and in the poor streets of communities like Imbaba.\" In an article by Bloomberg, Williams also observes a garbage crisis piling up on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. This piling up of organic MSW became hazardous because the organic waste then became a source of infectious diseases and led to an increase of rat infestation.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The peas are dried and the dull-coloured outer skin of the pea removed, then split in half by hand or by machine at the natural split in the seed's cotyledon. \n\nThere are green and yellow varieties of split pea. Gregor Mendel studied the inheritance of seed colour in peas; the green phenotype is recessive to the yellow one. Traditionally, the genotype of purebred yellow is \"YY\" and that of green is \"yy\", and hybrids of the two, \"Yy\", have a yellow (dominant) phenotype.\n\nSplit peas are high in protein and low in fat, with one gram of fat per serving. Most of the calories come from protein and complex carbohydrates. The split pea is known to be a natural food source that contains some of the highest amounts of dietary fibre, containing 26 grams of fibre per 100 gram portion (104% DV based on a diet).\n\nThe Indian \"toor dal\" (split pigeon peas) and \"chana dal\" (split yellow gram, desi chickpeas) are commonly also referred to as peas, although from other legume species than \"Pisum sativum\".\n\nGreen and yellow split peas are commonly used to make pea soup or \"split pea soup\", and sometimes pease pudding, which was commonly prepared in medieval Europe.\n\nYellow split pea is known as \"Lappeh\" \nin western Asia and particularly in Iran. It is the main ingredient of the Iranian food \"khoresh gheymeh\", which is served on the side of white rice in Iranian cuisine. It is also an important ingredient in the famous \"Tabriz köftesii\", a kofta speciality from northern Iran.\n\nIn north India, they are generally known as \"matar ki daal\", sometimes used as a cheaper variation for the very popular \"chhole\" on stalls offering it.\n\nYellow split peas are most often used to prepare \"dal\" in Guyana, Suriname, Mauritius, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago and Fiji. Referred to as simply \"dal\", it is prepared similarly to \"dals\" found in India, but also may be used in a variety of other recipes.\n\nYellow split peas are used to make a sweet snack in Beijing cuisine. \"Wandouhuang\" (豌豆黄) is a sweetened and chilled pease pudding, sometimes flavored with osmanthus blossoms and dates.\n\nIn Europe, the Greek \"Fava\" is a dish made with yellow split peas pureed to create an appetizer or meze.\n\nIn the Caribbean split peas are a key ingredient in many Indian dishes.\n\nSplit peas were used for an unusual non-culinary purpose during the Second World War. Great efforts were made to optimise the manufacture of the British Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft, speeding and cheapening manufacture while maintaining or enhancing performance. Flush-headed rivets were used on a prototype for the smoothest possible surfaces, but this made it more difficult, expensive, and slower to produce than using the usual dome-headed rivets. Rather than the cumbersome alternative of comparing actual rivets, split peas were glued over all the flush rivets to simulate dome heads. This reduced the speed by , which was unacceptable. Split peas were then progressively removed to determine which rivets really needed to be flush; the results were applied to production aeroplanes. The aircraft was later repurposed for recreational use, most commonly birthday joy flights.\n\n"}

Yoghurt is often used to take away some or all of the heat.\n\nMadras curry is said to originate from the south of India, and gets its name from the city known as Madras when English merchants arrived there in 1640 (now Chennai). However, the name 'Madras Curry' is not used in India, but was invented by restaurants in Britain. The spicy Madras curry served in British restaurants is different from authentic Madras curries, with the British variation originating from British Bangladeshi restaurants in the 1970s.\n\nThere are many variations on Madras curry and cooking in India is more a domestic practice than a cuisine governed by the conventions of chefs, restaurants, or texts. This curry can be vegetarian or made with meat. Availability of local or locally available ingredients is central to regional Indian foods. The end result of the signatures of Madras curries can be achieved through different means; the result often being that of: red colour; toasty spices; the sour-sweet fruitiness of tamarind; a slight liquorice flavour of anise; ginger; a range of other spices (sweet and savoury and earthy) and the flavours of salt, sweet and sour. The redness is achieved with chilli or a mixture of chilli and paprika, and the orange of turmeric. Additional sourness may be had from lemon, lime or vinegar. \n\nThe spices are complementary to the savoury flavours, which may include garlic and possibly onion or asafoetida. Garam masala, coriander, and black peppercorns may also be part of the spice mixture.\n\nCommon ingredients may also include fresh curry leaves, and the final addition of fresh coriander.\n\nThe variations include the roasting of many of the spices including dried chillis, coriander seed, aniseed, cumin and cinnamon. This can be done in an oven for 10 minutes at 180 °C, or in a frying pan with no oil at low heat. A basic spice mix for Madras curry can be made when these dried roasted ingredients are ground in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder and mixed with turmeric and stored in readiness for use.\n\nVariations are also related to means of storage. The primary spice ingredients can be stored as; roasted dried ground powder; a paste of dried ingredients with vinegar; an oil spice infusion.\n\nIf meat is used it may be lamb, beef, or chicken. When made of beef or lamb it is called Gosht (or Ghoust) Madras.\n\nCommon accompaniments to Madras curry include raita and fresh coriander. The food of southern India is more likely to have rice as the main carbohydrate than any breads e.g. naan. Individual households will express their own traditions.\n\nOther common variations will include brown mustard seeds which are fried till they pop, black peppercorns (a local tropical product) and vinegar as the acidulant instead of, or with, the acid fruits.\n\nThe dried roasted spices may be cooked in ghee or vegetable oil and then other major fresh ingredients such as garlic and ginger are added with the vegetables and/or meat. The sweet and sour ingredients such as tamarind and lemon juice/vinegar is added later. Finally the fresh coriander is added immediately prior to serving.\n\nOther variations may include the use of cloves, bay leaves, fenugreek and allspice.\n"}

In Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa it simply refers to wholemeal or whole wheat bread, except in the Maritimes, where it implies bread made with molasses. In some regions of the US, the bread is simply called wheat bread in contrast to \"white bread\".\n\nWhole wheat flours that contain raw wheat germ, instead of toasted germ, have higher levels of glutathione, and thus are said to result in lower loaf volumes.\n\nIn Ireland, during the Famine, prior to 1848, brown bread was handed out to the poor. In England, brown bread was made from brown meal. Around and prior to the year 1845, brown meal was considered a less desirable grain product, and was priced accordingly. However, by 1865, due to recently discovered health benefits of bran, brown meal's London price had increased to a point often greater than that of fine flour.\n\nHistorically, brown meal was what remained after about 90% of the coarse, outer bran and 74% of pure endosperm or fine flour was removed from the whole grain. Using slightly different extraction numbers, brown meal, representing 20% of the whole grain, was itself composed of about 15% fine bran and 85% white flour. In 1848 it was asserted grain millers knew only of bran and endosperm, but by 1912 it was more widely known that brown meal included the germ.\n\nThe brown color of whole grain breads is caused by cerealine, a discovery attributed to Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès of France. Cerealine, considered by Mouriès an active principal or ferment similar in action to diastase, came from the \"cereal\" layer of rectangular cells that millers considered a part of bran: later it was alternatively called the \"aleurone\" layer. In a statement attributed to Mouriès, if the cerealine is neutralized, white bread can be made from bran-containing flour.\n\nIrish wheaten bread is a form of Irish soda bread made with whole-wheat flour.\n\nBorodinsky bread is a slightly sweet sourdough rye bread of Russian origin, usually flavoured by caraway and coriander seeds and sweetened with molasses, which augments its already quite dark color coming from the rye flour. It is named after the Battle of Borodino, and the (unsubstantiated, as it goes) legend says that it was invented by the widow of one of the Russian generals perished in that battle, though in reality it was probably created much later, in the end of the 19th century.\n\nNew England or Boston brown bread is a type of dark, slightly sweet steamed bread (usually a quick bread) popular in New England. It is cooked by steam in a can, or cylindrical pan.\n\nBoston brown bread's colour comes from a mixture of flours, usually a mix of several of the following: cornmeal, rye, whole wheat, graham flour, and from the addition of sweeteners like molasses and maple syrup. Leavening most often comes from baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) though a few recipes use yeast. Raisins are often added. The batter is poured into a can, and steamed in a kettle. While most variations are quick breads, and can be made in less than an hour, several commercial brands are available. Brown bread is somewhat seasonal, being served mostly in fall and winter, and is frequently served with baked beans.\n\nBrown bread is closely related to an earlier bread known as \"Rye n Injun\" (from \"Indian\" cornmeal) or \"thirded\" bread from its use of rye, cornmeal and wheat flours. Unlike modern Boston brown bread, thirded bread is generally yeast-raised and baked rather than steamed.\n\n"}

Most varieties come in mild and hot versions, but all tend to have a strong garlic flavor. Beer cheese is traditionally served with saltine crackers, though it can be found served with various other crackers and crudités, most often as an appetizer.\n\nWhile there are conflicting stories about beer cheese's origins, it appears to have first been served in the 1940s at a restaurant in Clark County, Kentucky known as Johnny Allman's. The owner of the restaurant, John Allman, credited the invention of the cheese spread to his cousin, Joe Allman, a chef in Phoenix, Arizona. Joe's Southwestern influence is said by some to explain the spread's spicy nature.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, the Kentucky Legislature decreed Clark County as the birthplace of beer cheese.\n\nAn annual Beer Cheese Festival is held in downtown Winchester, KY (the county seat of Clark County) featuring local arts & crafts vendors as well as both commercial and amateur recipe contests.\n\n"}

Originally the penalty would have been a simple monetary fine imposed for a more serious breach of discipline, and the word is known to have been used in this sense as early as 1617. \n\nMinor offences for which a sconce might have been imposed included talking at dinner about women, religion, politics or one's work, referring to the portraits hung in the college hall, or making an error in the pronunciation of the Latin Grace.\n\nThe power to impose a sconce was not originally given to all present at a dinner. It might instead have been reserved for the person presiding on High Table, or perhaps the senior Scholar or other undergraduate at each table. Anyone feeling a sconce was deserved would be required to ask for its imposition (often in a \"scholarly\" language such as Latin or Ancient Greek). Should their request be granted a large vessel, usually full of beer, would be called for and the offender would have to attempt to drink it down in one go (perhaps while standing on the table). The amount of a sconce varied from at Corpus, Oriel or Jesus, up to at St John's. Several colleges retain impressive antique \"sconce pots\" in their silver collections.\n\nIn the event that a person failed to drain his sconce, he was generally required to pay for the contents. It was also once relatively common for the sconced person to choose to share the contents of the sconce with their neighbours at table, thereby making amends to the \"victims\" of the original breach of good manners.\n\nSconcing today is a phenomenon associated with 'crew dates', when typically a men's sports team and a women's sports team have a dinner together. Anyone at the table may stand and announce \"I sconce anyone who ...\". Those to whom the description applies must then stand and either take a drink or finish their glass. In this way it resembles the drinking game Never have I ever, but with focus on an individual, and no requirement for sconces to proceed around the table.\n"}

{"id": "6533604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6533604", "title": "Bush bread", "text": "Bush bread\n\nBush bread, or seedcakes, refers to the bread made by Australian Aboriginals for many thousands of years, by crushing seeds into a dough, after which it is baked. The bread was high in protein and carbohydrate, and helped form part of a balanced traditional diet.\n\nWith the arrival of Europeans and pre-milled white flour, this bread-making process all but disappeared (although women were still recorded to be making seedcakes in Central Australia in the 1970s). The tradition of cooking bread in hot coals continues today.\n\nBread-making was a woman's task. It was generally carried out by several women at once, due to its labour-intensive nature. It involved collecting seasonal grains, legumes, roots or nuts, and preparing these into flour and then dough, or directly into a dough.\n\nSeeds varied depending on the time of year and the area in Australia that the people lived. In Central Australia, native millet (\"Panicum decompositum\"; \"Panicum australianse\") and spinifex (\"Triodia\") were commonly used. Wattleseed could also be used in the flour mix.\n\nWomen harvested the fully ripe, dry seeds of the plant by beating the grass (or pod-laden trees in the case of wattleseed) with sticks to dislodge the seeds. Some species were eaten at the green stage and, when ground, would produce a juice at the side of the millstone, which was drunk directly.\n\nSome seeds (such as the seed of acacia) need to be heated, hulled and then ground dry, while others (such as those of grasses) can be ground with water.\n\nIn the Kimberley region of Western Australia, women observed that, after the dry season, many seeds would be gathered around the opening of harvester ants' nests. The ants had effectively collected and husked the seed for them, and they were able to collect this seed, making their job a lot easier. After allowing the grain to dry, they could begin to prepare the flour.\n\nPigwig (\"Portulaca oleracea\"), Prickly wattle (\"Acacia victoriae\"), Mulga (\"Acacia aneura\"), Dead finish seed (\"Acacia tetragonophylla\"), Bush bean (\"Rhyncharrhena linearis\").\n\nAfter the grain was collected, it needed to be winnowed, which was done using the coolamon, the multi-purpose carrying vessel. Sometimes it needed to be winnowed several times.\n\nOnce the grain was winnowed, it was ground using a millstone, to create flour. Millstones have been discovered which have proven to be as old as 50,000 years. The flour was then mixed with water to make a dough and placed in hot ashes for baking. The results could be small buns, today referred to as johnny cakes, or a large loaf, known today as damper. Damper appears to be a mix of this traditional style of bread-making and European-style bread-making.\n\nThe dough could also be eaten raw. Cooking was a good way to prepare the bread if the group was about to travel for some time.\n\nBread could also be made from roots and corms of plants. In the Top End of Australia, people such as the Yolngu used the lotus root and wild taro. These were ground, then mixed to a paste to make bread.\n\nWater lily seed bread was also popular in the Top End. The two species of water lily used were \"Nelumbo nucifera\" and \"Nymphaea macrosperma\". During the early part of the dry season, water lilies were an important part of the diet, with seed pods eaten raw or ground into paste.\n\nWomen had expert knowledge of how to \"de-toxify\" certain plant foods. The seeds of the cycad palm, \"Cycas media\", are highly carcinogenic when raw, and require elaborate treatment including shelling, crushing, leaching in running water for up to five days, then cooking. After this they are made into small loaves, which can keep for a number of weeks.\n\nIn Queensland, the people of the Mount Tamborine area used the bunya pine cone (bunya nut), endemic to the area, to make bread in this way.\n\nIll-fated explorers Burke and Wills survived on bush bread for some time after they ran out of rations due to the death of their camels. The Cooper Creek Aboriginals, the Yandruwandha people, gave them fish, beans called \"padlu\", and bread made from the ground sporocarps of the \"ngardu\" (nardoo) plant (\"Marsilea drummondii\").\n\nThere is some evidence that the nardoo contributed to their deaths. Wills's last journal entry includes the following:\n\nIt is possible that the explorers, in preparing the bread themselves, were not preparing it in the traditional way of the Aboriginal people, which may have involved soaking seeds prior to grinding in order to remove the enzyme thiaminase, which depletes the body of vitamin B. It is therefore believed that the deaths of Burke and Wills resulted in part from the vitamin deficiency disease beri-beri. However, other research suggests that scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6541883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6541883", "title": "Fishing float", "text": "Fishing float\n\nA fishing float (or bobber in the US) is an item of angling equipment. Usually attached to a fishing line, it can serve several purposes. Firstly, it can suspend the bait at a predetermined depth; secondly, due to its buoyancy, it can carry the baited hook to otherwise inaccessible areas of water by allowing the float to drift in the prevailing current; and thirdly, a float also serves as a visual bite indicator. Fishing with a float is sometimes called float fishing.\n\nFloats come in different sizes and shapes, and can be made from various materials, such as balsa wood, cork, plastic, Indian sarcanda reed (Erianthus family), or even bird/porcupine quills. The float is used to enable the angler to cast out a bait away from the shore or boat while maintaining a reference point to where the bait is unlike bottom or leger fishing. The angler will select an appropriate float after taking into account the strength of the current (if any), the wind speed, the size of the bait he or she is using, the depth the angler wishes to present that bait at and the distance the bait is to be cast. Usually, the line between the float and hook will have small weights attached, ensuring that the float sits vertically in the water with only a small brightly coloured tip remaining visible. The rest of the float is usually finished in a dull neutral colour to render it as inconspicuous as possible to the fish. Each float style is designed to be used in certain types of conditions such as slow or fast rivers, windy or still water or small confined waters such as canals.\n\nIt is impossible to say with any degree of accuracy who first used a float for indicating that a fish had taken the bait, but it can be said with some certainty that people used pieces of twig, bird feather quills or rolled leaves as bite indicators, many years before any documented evidence. The first known mention of using a float appears in the book \"Treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle\" written by Juliana Berners in 1496.\n\n\"\"All maner lynes that be not for the grounde must haue flotes, and the rennyng ground lyne must haue a flote, the lyeng ground lyne must haue a flote.\"\"\n\nThe method described, involved boring a hole through a cork so the line could be passed through and trapped with a quill. Later books such as \"the Art of Angling\"by Gerald Eades Bentley in 1577 and the classic work \"The Compleat Angler\" first published in 1653, written by Isaak Walton gave greater detail on fishing and using floats.\n\nPrior to about 1800, anglers made their own floats, a practice that many still carry on today. As angling became more popular, companies started to make floats in different styles to supply the growing demand. By 1921, companies such as Wadhams had at least 250 mainly celluloid floats in their catalog.\n\nSince those early days, the fishing float has become the subject of much practical and theoretical change. English anglers such as Peter Drennan (Drennan International) and Kenneth Middleton (Middy Tackle) and American fishermen like Chicago's ex World Champion Mick Thill (Thill Floats) have built up large companies designing and marketing fishing floats. The English companies have been supported by major league anglers such as Ivan Marks, Benny Ashurst and Billy Lane.\n\nThe Avon float is a straight float with a body at the top. It was designed to cope with the fast flow conditions of the English River Avon. Many early floats were Avon style having a cork body pushed onto a crow quill. It is fished attached to the line top and bottom.\n\nBubble floats are small hollow balls which are used to control the fishing line. They may have the facility to be partially filled with water to control how much float is above the water. They are used in situations where a normal float cannot be cast, such a working close to the edge of reeds or heavy surface plant growth. The bubble float can be allowed to drift into the area without tangling.\n\nThe Dink Float is most commonly made of a cylinder of dark foam with a smaller cylinder of cork on the top painted for indicator. The line is run through the top, wrapped around the cylinder and through the bottom. Main advantage is that the float needs no stopper on the main line, the wrap of line between the top of bottom of float will hold it in place.\n\nA popper float, commonly called a 'popping cork' is designed to mimic a large fish feeding at the surface with rod action. There are different styles of popper floats, some use a metal wire with beads at each end to make a clicking noise when pulled through the water, while more modern floats make use of a concave top, which make a deep chugging sound when pulled through the water, imitating the sound of large predator fish feeding at the surface. Some popping corks also have pellets inside, designed to mimic bait fish jumping at the surface when rattled.\n\nThe quill is one of the earliest floats, originally it was a bird feather quill but with the opening up of new worlds, porcupine quills from Africa became a standard for the float. It is fished in the same way as a stick float.\n\nSelf-cocking floats can be of many styles but they are all weighted so that in the water they automatically stand upright without the use of shot or weights on the fishing line.\n\nThe Stick Float is a straight float with a taper. It is always attached to the line both top and bottom. They are made from two different materials, a light, buoyant top section of balsa wood and a heavy stem of hard grade cane, non-buoyant hardwood, or plastic. Unlike the Avon float, the stick has no body; it is just a tapered rod.\n\nA waggler float \nis the term given to any float which is attached only at the bottom to the line. They come in two different types, straight or bodied. These two types can come both with and without inserts (antennas). They are made from a variety of materials including quills (such as peacock), balsa wood, cane, plastic and reed.\n\nFloats with direction control change direction by planing or moving to one side when given a tug.\n"}

Both gold and the philosopher's stone were associated with the color red, as rubedo signalled alchemical success, and the end of the great work. Rubedo is also known by the Greek word, \"Iosis\".\n\nThe three alchemical stages preceding rubedo were nigredo (blackness) which represented putrefaction and spiritual death, albedo (whiteness) which represented purification, and citrinitas (yellowness); the solar dawn or awakening. \n\nThe symbols used in alchemical writing and art to represent this red stage can include blood, a phoenix, a rose, a crowned king, or a figure wearing red clothes. Countless sources mention a reddening process; the seventeenth dictum of the 12th century Turba Philosophorum is one example:\n\nIn the framework of psychological development (especially with followers of Jungian psychology), these four alchemical steps are viewed as analogous to the process of attaining individuation.

Nearly all substances therefore reach a density maximum at very low temperatures and very high pressures, characteristic properties of the solid state of matter.\n\nAn especially notable irregular maximum density is that of water, which reaches a density peak at .

Owned by the same family, each one is part candy store and part sit-down ice cream parlor. The older of the two establishments has been operating at the same location for more than nine decades and is widely considered a \"Chicago legend\".\n\nThe original Margie’s is located on Western Avenue in Chicago’s Bucktown neighborhood. Initially known as the Security Sweet Shop, it was founded in 1921 by a Greek immigrant named Peter George Poulos, who soon handed the business to his son George. Chicago mobster Al Capone allegedly patronized the sweet shop during its early years.\n\nIn 1933, George Poulos renamed the confectionery Margie’s Candies in honor of his wife, whom he had met at the sweet shop as a youngster. Margie herself began running the business during the 1940s while her husband was serving in the military, and she took full control in 1954 after her husband died of an ulcer. She never remarried, and for the next forty years, she regularly worked in the restaurant for about 15 hours a day, becoming a familiar sight for customers.\nMargie’s cemented its place in Chicago lore in 1965 when it hosted the Beatles, who had just played a concert at Comiskey Park. According to the Poulos family, the band came into Margie’s with five girls and ordered several six-scoop \"Atomic Sundaes\" to share with them. The confectionery currently has a large display of Beatles memorabilia to commemorate the visit.\n\nMargie’s gained additional attention in the early 1990s when Margie Poulos appeared in two thirty-second clips on MTV showcasing individuals with interesting occupations. These clips, which portrayed Margie as she made chocolates, were used to fill the time between commercials and music videos. Singer Liz Phair further popularized the confectionery in 1993 when she posed there for a photograph used in a \"Newsweek\" interview.\n\nIn 2005, the original Margie’s was mentioned in one of the riddles used for the OurColony Alternate reality game. The message read, \"Here sweet Margie sits. At this difference it sees the rich, the poor and everything in between\". Successful players realized that the riddle referred to Western Avenue, a long street which runs through many diverse neighborhoods.\n\nMargie Poulos died in 1995, and her son Peter assumed control of the business. In 2005, he opened a second Margie’s Candies in the North Center neighborhood of Chicago, replacing a closed Fannie May shop. This was the business’s first foray into expansion.\n\nBoth confectionaries provide roughly the same menu, and though they are both called Margie’s \"Candies\", they are arguably most popular for their homemade ice cream. Each provides over fifty varieties of sundaes, including the aforementioned Atomic Sundae, the half-gallon World’s Largest Sundae, and the twenty-five scoop Royal George (named after George Poulos). They also provide products such as banana splits, waffle cones, pie à la mode and milkshakes.\n\nThe confectionaries’ candy and chocolate line include chocolate-covered cherries, chocolate-covered nuts, cocoa, marzipan, English toffee, and fudge. In addition, they serve a small selection of standard diner fare, such as burgers, sandwiches and soups.\n\nMuch of the décor at the original Margie’s has remained unchanged since the confectionery first opened, which has added to its appeal for many Chicagoans. Some of its trademark features are its multiple original Tiffany lamps, a marble soda fountain, and old-fashioned booths with miniature jukeboxes. The entire establishment is also adorned with newspaper clippings, stuffed animals, and aging photographs of past customers.\n\nThe North Center Margie’s has attempted to replicate the ambiance of its predecessor with the help of antiques and old photographs.\n\n"}

{"id": "6583790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6583790", "title": "Namus", "text": "Namus\n\nNāmūs is the Arabic word (Greek \"νόμος\") of a concept of an ethical category, a virtue, in Middle Eastern patriarchal character. Literally translated as \"virtue\", it is now more popularly used in a strong gender-specific context of relations within a family described in terms of honor, attention, respect/respectability, and modesty.\n\nThe concept of \"namus\" in respect to sexual integrity of family members is an ancient, exclusively cultural concept which predates Islam, Judaism, and Christianity.\n\nThe Arabic word \"nāmūs\" () may mean \"law\", \"custom\" or \"honor\". The Ancient Greek word \"nómos\" (νόμος) means \"law, custom\".\n\n\"Namus\" has been translated into English from the Turkish language with different meanings. Honor is used to mean \"namus\" in the English language translation of Filiz Kardam's 2005 paper on \"namus cinayetleri\" (literally \"namus\" murders), but Nüket Kardam has written that chastity is a more accurate translation than honor. By the latter definition, honor is seen as an imperfect translation because the concept of \"namus\" implies the idea that men have a right to insist on feminine chastity. This is built into the legal system which permits reduced sentences for honor killings.\n\nThe Turkish language has multiple words to describe related concepts of honor including \"namus\", \"onur\" and \"şeref\". Though \"namus\" is often understood as feminine sexual virtue or chastity, this definition is becoming outdated amongst some members of Turkish society. The official definition of \"namus\" from the Foundation of Turkish Language is \"the attachment of a society to moral rules\".\n\nWomen's premarital virginity is still regarded as a matter of honor by some families. These cultural perceptions persist in modern metropolitan areas, as well as in the more traditional areas of the rural countryside. Some old-fashioned customs continue to endure, such as requiring proof of virginity in the form of blooded sheets, or in some cases by medical examination. Though Kemalism has contributed to the rapid modernization of the country in many aspects, traditional sexual mores have proven to be resilient. Even those families who encouraged their daughters to pursue professional careers as teachers, doctors or lawyers maintained the expectation that these women would continue to conduct themselves virtuously as \"dedicated mothers, and modest housewives\".\n\nIn some societies, e.g., in Pashtun tribes of Afghanistan, \"namus\" goes beyond the basic family and is common for a \"plarina\", a unit of the tribe that has a common ancestral father.\n\nThe \"namus\" of a man is violated if, for example, a daughter is born into the family instead of a son, or if an adult daughter is not dressed \"appropriately\", or if he tolerates an offense without reaction.\n\nAmong Pashtuns an encroachment on a man's plot of land also signifies violation of his \"namus\".\n\nAccording to those who adhere to this concept, a man is supposed to control the women in his family. If he loses control of them (his wife, sisters, daughters), his \"namus\" is lost in the eyes of the community and he has to cleanse his (and his family's) honor. This is often done by abortion, murder or forced suicide.\n\nIn the Western world, such cases are especially visible in immigrant societies when a girl faces the conflict between her choice of the culture of the new home society and the traditions of the old home.\n\nIn cases of rape, the woman is not seen as a victim. Instead, it is considered that the \"namus\" of the whole family has been violated, and to restore it, an honor killing of the raped woman may happen (estimated 5,000 victims yearly and on the rise worldwide). The raped woman may also commit forced suicide. In Pakistan, acid is often thrown on the victim's face to disfigure her as an alternative to murder.\n\nIn British Bangladeshi immigrant culture and in Anatolian Turkish culture the violation of namus can result in the murder of the male involved with the female family member.\n\nMeanwhile, in cases of \"namus\" loss due to the arrival of a female child into the family, infanticide or sex-selective abortion may occur.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on Human Rights gathered reports from several countries and considering only the countries that submitted reports it was shown that honor killings have occurred in Bangladesh, Great Britain, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Sweden, Turkey, United States, Canada and Uganda.\nIn 2002 international attention was drawn to the honor killing of Fadime Şahindal, of the Kurdish minority in Sweden, who violated \"namus\" by suing her father and brother for threats made against her and then rejecting the marriage arranged for her.\n\nSome Jordanian Islamic groups say that punishment of adulterous wives should be left to the state, while others say Islam advocates that male relatives should carry out the punishment. Yotam Feldner writes, \"if honor killing originated in pre-Islamic Arab tribalism, it has long since been incorporated into Islamic society and thereby become common throughout the Muslim world\". However, \"'Izzat Muhaysin, a psychiatrist at the Gaza Program for Mental Health, [...] says that the culture of the society perceives one who refrains from 'washing shame with blood' as 'a coward who is not worthy of living.'\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, of women are murdered by their families each year in the name of family 'honor'.\n\nThe 1925 Armenian silent film \"Namus\" tells the ill fate of two lovers, who were betrothed by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of \"namus\", the girl was married by her father to another person. In 2006 it was restored, digitized and dubbed in French. Abdullah Goran (1904–1962), the modern Kurdish poet, condemned honour killing in his poem \"Berde-nûsêk\" (\"A Tomb-Stone\").\n\nIn France and in Germany, where there is a large Middle Eastern Muslim diaspora, the women sometimes may resort cosmetic surgery.\n\n\n"}

This includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been processed so that they can be safely stored at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life. \n\nVarious food preservation and packaging techniques are used to extend a food's shelf life. Decreasing the amount of available water in a product, increasing its acidity, or irradiating or otherwise sterilizing the food and then sealing it in an air-tight container are all ways of depriving bacteria of suitable conditions in which to thrive. All of these approaches can all extend a food's shelf life without unacceptably changing its taste or texture.\n\nFor some foods alternative ingredients can be used. Common oils and fats become rancid relatively quickly if not refrigerated; replacing them with hydrogenated oils delays the onset of rancidity, increasing shelf life. This is a common approach in industrial food production, but recent concerns about health hazards associated with trans fats have led to their strict control in several jurisdictions. Even where trans fats are not prohibited, in many places there are new labeling laws (or rules), which require information to be printed on packages, or to be published elsewhere, about the amount of trans fat contained in certain products.\n\nPackage sterility and seal integrity are vital for commercially packaged shelf-stable food products. With flexible packaging (plastic films, foils, laminates, etc), the choice of materials and process conditions are an important decision for packaging engineers.\n\nAll aspects of food production, package filling and sealing must be tightly controlled and meet regulatory requirements. Uniformity, sterility and other requirements are needed to maintain Good Manufacturing Practices.\n\nProduct safety management is vital. A complete Quality Management System must be in place. Verification and validation involves collecting documentary evidence of all aspects of compliance. Quality assurance extends beyond the packaging operations through distribution.\n\nCommercial canning involves cooking food and sealing it in sterilized tin cans. Home canning usually involves mason jars and boiling the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of sterilization.\n\nRetort pouches involve heat processing the food in sterilized heat-stable flexible packages. This is used for camping food and military field rations \nThe first shelf-stable formulation of ranch dressing, created in 1983, had a shelf life of 150 days.\nPasturized milk in aseptically processed cartons (Tetra Brik, etc.) is shelf-stable without refrigeration.\nFruit juice can be processed with proper pasteurization to allow shelf-stable options.\n\n"}

It continues to be sold under the \"Farmers Union\" banner, originally a South Australian co-operative, subsequently the listed company National Foods, and then by a series of subsidiaries of the Japanese brewing company Kirin. The current manufacturer's company name is Lion Dairy & Drinks.\n\nFirst launched in 1977 when \"Farmers Union\" was a co-operative of South Australian dairy farmers, the brand has achieved iconic status in South Australia and is now also available in all other Australian states and territories. The drink is made with coffee, glucose, and homogenised reduced fat milk and milk solids. In the past Farmers Union Iced Coffee's labelling also made mention of \"iced confection\" as an ingredient. The flavour of the product changed considerably when this ingredient was removed. The product is available predominantly in 600 mL and smaller 375 mL cardboard cartons. It is also sold in 1 litre cardboard cartons, 2 and 3 litre plastic bottles and 750 mL plastic bottles also known as Stubbies. \n\nIn 2003, Australians consumed in excess of 22,000,000 litres of Farmers Union Iced coffee, making it Australia's best selling flavoured milk drink/milk shake at that time. The drink's popularity has more recently been reflected by some McDonald's, KFC and Hungry Jack's restaurants selling it as a part of their menus across the country. In 2008, Farmers Union Iced Coffee outsold Coca-Cola in South Australia at a rate of almost 3:1, with South Australians consuming 36 million litres, making it the only place in the world where a milk drink outsells a cola product, and one of the few places where Coca-Cola is not the most popular locally consumed bottled beverage, a success shared only by Inca Kola in Peru and Irn-Bru in Scotland and various drinks in nearly every Asian country.\n\nFarmers Union Iced Coffee in Australia also enjoys a high profile for popular commercials featuring rough male workers acting out ballet with heavy machinery in order to take up their boss on his word that he would provide them with a truck load of Iced Coffee if all his workers took up ballet. Another well-known run of advertisements features a dramatic voice-over detailing world headlines and issues, but shows very low-key average Australian equivalents on screen. These include:\n\nOn Monday, 23 October 2006, two new flavours of Farmers Union Iced Coffee were released in South Australia. Farmers Union Strong Iced Coffee which features a stronger coffee blend, which subsequently began sale in Tasmania, and Farmers Union Light Iced Coffee which has no added sugar (aspartame is substituted for sugar) and a taste similar to the original.\n\nAccording to the company, both the original variety and the Light flavours contain approximately 18 mg of caffeine per 100 mL, while the Farmers Union Strong Iced Coffee contains 24 mg.\n\nThe Light Iced Coffee proved to be rather unpopular, as many consumers didn't like the slightly weaker taste and chose the original alternative. In August 2011, the company released a new product Farmers Union Iced Coffee One, claiming that One had \"100% taste, 1% fat and no added sugar\", and was a completely new formulation. FUIC One was not overly popular at launch, given the reputation of the Light Iced Coffee, leading to a huge promotion in December 2011, where customers who 'liked' the On the Run Facebook page could print a coupon from the internet, and redeem one of 10,000 free Iced Coffee Ones from any petrol station or convenience outlet in South Australia.\n\nAlso sold under Farmers Union imprint are the Feel Good range of low-fat/sugar milk drinks, currently including coffee and chocolate flavors.\n\nThanks to its shared South Australian origins, the cupholders of the locally made third generation Mitsubishi Magna were designed to hold both normal round drinks and Farmers Union Iced Coffee cartons.

It is also the name of the dish or \"antojito\" (very similar to the torta) made with this bread dipped in a red \"guajillo\" pepper sauce and filled with \"papas con chorizo\" (potatoes with chorizo).\n\nThe bread (telera)used for pambazos is white and lacks a crispy crust. This particular bread is made of flour, and is softerthan the similar bolillo (also used for sandwiches), which allows it to retain its shape while being soaked in sauce. Teleras are usually found in Mexican bakeries where they are sold just as any other white bread. \n\nIt is unclear since when or why the pambazo is prepared and filled in a very specific way. While other similar dishes changed the fillings or toppings, the pambazo recipe remains almost the same. The bread is first filled with the potato and chorizo, then dipped in warm red \"guajillo\" pepper sauce, which gives the bread its famous orange-red sprinkled coloration. Once the bread has been soaked, it is passed on to fry in a bit of oil. The pambazo is to fry on the top and bottom of the bread. The pambazo is ready whenever the bread being fried becomes crispy on both sides. It is then garnished with shredded lettuce, \"salsa\" (sauce), crema (cream), and queso fresco (fresh cheese).\n\nIn the Mexican State of Veracruz, the pambazo, the bread, after some proofing the buns are punched in a bed of wheat flour and then back to proofing and baked. Once the bread is ready the top remain dusted and is sliced to the filling of layered grided refried black beans with chorizo , shreaded lettuce, sliced chipotle peppers in adobo, ground or squared queso blanco or queso fresco and spread mayonaisse. From food stands to backpacks or school lunch boxes the sandwich is wrapped in napkins to gently avoid dusted fingers, nose and lips. In other regions is filled with ham or polish meat. At bithday parties, parties or social events, small sized pambazos are served instead of canapés. These are known as pambacitos, which literally means \"little pambazo\".\n\nThe pambazo bread got its name from the Ladino word \"pan basso\" (Spanish \"pan bajo\") or low-class bread from Mexico's viceregal period. During that period, there were bakeries in Mexico dedicated solely to this type of bread named 'panbasserias' (\"pambacerías\").\n\nIn some villages from State of Mexico, the pambazos are made with Semitic Mediterranean cuisine influence by the use the \"acemite\" or bran for bread made in artisan bakeries about horns of Spanish colonial period, as the case of Malinalco, Tequixquiac and Amecameca.\n\nIn Malinalco, state of Mexico makes other pambazos, a Spanish colonial meal are made flour more small to Mexico City pambazos, filled with sausage and potatoes, chicken meat with epazote, shredded lettuce, white cheese, cream and spicy salsa.\n\nIn Tequixquiac, state of Mexico makes pambazos very different to Mexico City, are made flour with dark wheat rind or bran named acemite, filled with sausage and potatoes, turkey meat or lamb meat (barbacoa), shredded lettuce, white cheese, cream and spicy chili chipotle sauce, fried with butter. The name is registered in this place as \"pan bazo\", an archaic Spanish word.\n\nIn Puebla City, pambazos are made with flour in the bread named \"cemita\" or acemite, filled with sausage and potatoes, avocado, papalo, white cheese, cream and with red spicy \"salsa\" on the pambazo.\n\nIn Orizaba, Veracruz, an important place with Sephardic roots, is made a pambazo with Pole meat, is mixture with traditional pambazo or acemite, Polish beef meat and lettuce, with spicy sauce.\n\n\"The Daily Meal\" reviewed the pambazo with \"it’s insanely delicious\" in their article \"12 Life-Changing Sandwiches You've Never Heard Of\".\n\n\n\n"}

Possible English translations include pork blood stew or blood pudding stew.\n\n\"Dinuguan\" is also called \"sinugaok\" in Batangas, \"zinagan\" in Ibanag, \"twik\" in Itawis, \"tid-tad\" in Kapampangan, \"dinardaraan\" in Ilocano, \"dugo-dugo\" in Cebuano, \"rugodugo\" in Waray, \"sampayna\" or \"champayna\" in Northern Mindanao and \"tinumis\" in Bulacan and Nueva Ecija. Another name for dinuguan is \"chocolate meat\".\n\nThis dish is rather similar to European-style blood sausage, or British and Irish black pudding in a saucy stew form. It is perhaps closer in appearance and preparation to the Polish soup Czernina or an even more ancient Spartan dish known as \"melas zomos\" (black soup) whose primary ingredients were pork, vinegar and blood.\n\nDinuguan can also be served without using any offal, using only choice cuts of pork. In Batangas, this version is known as \"sinungaok\". It can also be made from beef and chicken meat, the latter being known as \"dinuguang manok\" ('chicken dinuguan'). \"Dinuguan\" is usually served with white rice or a Philippine rice cake called puto. The Northern Luzon versions of the dish namely the Ilocano \"dinardaraan\" and the Ibanag \"zinagan\" are often drier with toppings of deep-fried pork intestine cracklings. The Itawis of Cagayan also have a pork-based version that has larger meat chunks and more fat, which they call \"twik\".\n\nThe most important ingredient of Dinuguan recipe is obviously the pig's (pork) blood. Pork blood is used in many other Asian cuisines either as coagulated blood acting as a meat extender or as a mixture for the broth itself. Pork Dinuguan is the latter.\n\nOther regional variants of \"dinuguan\" include:\n\n\nA vegetarian version is known as \"beanuguan\" and is made of red beans, tofu, onions, chilies, garlic, and vinegar. The red beans are cooked, mashed with water or vegetable stock added, then drained to remove the skin. Sometimes cornflour is added to thicken the liquid, so the consistency mimics coagulated blood.\n\nMembers of the Iglesia ni Cristo, a Philippines-based church, are forbidden from eating dinuguan since it contains blood, which they are not allowed to eat.\n"}

In the German language they are called Amerikaner. There are regional differences: strictly, a black-and-white cookie is flat, has fondant icing on a shortbread base, and is common in New York City, while a half-moon cookie is slightly dome-shaped, has frosting on a cake base, and is common in Central New York. Often one side is frosted higher than the other. Black-and-white cookies may also be found with frosting instead of fondant.\n\nThe origin of the black-and-white cookie in New York City is commonly traced to Glaser's Bake Shop in Yorkville, founded in 1902 by Bavarian immigrants. The black-and-white cookie was among the original recipes used by the bakery. Half-moon cookies, however, can be traced to Hemstrought's Bakery in Utica, New York, around 1925. The relationship between the two origins is murky; it is likely that both recipes share a common German root, although the origin and name of \"Amerikaner\" in Germany is also unclear. Purported explanations include a corruption of the word \"Ammoniumhydrogencarbonat\" (ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent), or that the cookie was (re)introduced to Germany by American GIs in the 1950s. German \"Amerikaner\" are often frosted entirely with vanilla. In the former East Germany, due to anti-American sentiment, the name \"Ammonplätzchen\" (Ammonia cookies) was used.\n\nBlack-and-white cookies are mentioned twice on \"Seinfeld\", set in New York City. In the episode \"The Dinner Party\", Jerry eats a black-and-white cookie while waiting in a bakery with Elaine. He uses the cookie as a metaphor for racial harmony, saying the chocolate and vanilla represent black and white people living together and if they mix together well on a cookie they can do the same in society, suggesting the answer to poor race relations is to \"Look to the cookie!\"\n\nAlso in reference to racial harmony, Barack Obama dubbed them Unity Cookies when visiting a deli in Hollywood, Florida in 2008.\n\n"}

Akkadian took over all these uses and added to them a logographic reading for the native \"ilum\" and from that a syllabic reading of . In Hittite orthography, the syllabic value of the sign was again only \"an\".\n\nThe concept of \"divinity\" in Sumerian is closely associated with the heavens, as is evident from the fact that the cuneiform sign doubles as the ideogram for \"sky\", and that its original shape is the picture of a star. The original association of \"divinity\" is thus with \"bright\" or \"shining\" hierophanies in the sky.\n\nThe Sumerian sign DIĜIR originated as a star-shaped ideogram indicating a god in general, or the Sumerian god An, the supreme father of the gods. \"Dingir\" also meant sky or heaven in contrast with \"ki\" which meant earth.

Phusion operates as Drink Four Brewing Company. Four Loko, the company's most popular beverage, debuted in the United States market in 2005 and is available in 49 states, and in 21 countries including Guatemala, Paraguay, The Bahamas, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, China, Canada and some countries in Europe. The name \"Four\" is derived from the original drink's content of four standard drinks.\n\nFour branded products have been the object of legal, ethical, and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to underage drinkers and the danger of combining alcohol and caffeine. After the beverage was banned in several states, a product reintroduction in December 2010 removed caffeine, taurine, and guarana as ingredients, and the malt beverage is no longer marketed as an energy drink.\n\nPhusion Projects was founded in 2005 by Chris Hunter, Jaisen Freeman and Jeff Wright after graduating from The Ohio State University. As students they were active members of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, and many of their original drink blends were created in the fraternity mansion's basement and party room. They had enjoyed caffeine mixed with alcohol, and recalled buying Thai energy drinks from a nearby Asian market to sell to other students at a markup, claiming that they were \"importing the stuff from abroad\". They would later describe themselves as \"our own target market\".\n\nIn 2005, the entrepreneurial team designed a prototype \"energy beer\" now known as Four Loko. Marketed as a \"premium malt beverage\" in cherry and berry flavors, the drink contained taurine, guarana, caffeine and wormwood—the supposed psychoactive ingredient of absinthe. After a year, the company was running low on investment and decided to drop the wormwood, focusing instead on improving the flavor and increasing the alcohol content.\n\nBy 2008 the product had become popular and a variety of flavors were introduced into the US market. At the start of 2009, the beverage was becoming successful and began to be marketed overseas. In October 2010 a new flavor called Lemon Lime was first produced.\n\nFour Loko contains carbonated water, sugar, and natural and artificial flavoring including FD&C Red 40. The drink is either 6%, 7%, 8%, 12% or 14% alcohol by volume (ABV), depending on state regulations, and is packaged in 23.5 oz (695 mL) cans.\n\n\n\nIn early 2011, Phusion Projects introduced its Four Loko XXX Limited Edition line, which featured a new flavor of Four Loko every few months, including:\nIn the summer of 2011, Phusion introduced 12 oz (350 mL) glass bottles of Four Loko, that came in packs of six and had 8% ABV as opposed to 12%. Flavors included:\n\nBottles came in packs of six and In September 2011, Phusion introduced 16 oz (475 mL) cans of their drink in hi-cone four packs known as Four Poco Loko, with 8% ABV and included flavors:\n\nOriginal formulations of both beverages were a malt liquor based, caffeinated alcoholic energy drink with added guarana and taurine.\n\nIn 2008, Phusion Projects began selling their products in Canada and Europe. The European version of Four MaXed is sold in 8.3 oz (250 mL) glass bottles and aluminum cans and is spirit-based; the United States version has a malt liquor base.\n\nIn 2009, Four Loko ranked fourth in sales growth among alcoholic beverages at 7-Eleven stores in the United States.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, Phusion Projects issued a press release announcing that the company would be reformulating all Four brand beverages to remove caffeine, guarana, and taurine from the products. The new product was reintroduced in January 2011.\n\nOn October 25, 2013, Four Loko was distributed for the first time in Puerto Rico. Four Loko kept the standard 12% alcohol but in a reduced can size of 16 oz (475 mL), and with only three flavors : \n\nIn August 2016, Four Loko began selling in China. Secondary marketer Taobao claimed to still have for purchase the caffeinated version of the beverage. Four Loko has since seen market growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Mongolia and Singapore.\n\nIn February 2017, Four Loko announced the release of two new product lines—the Bold Series and the Bartender Series. \n\nThe Four Loko Bold Series comes in 24 oz. cans at 14% ABV, and includes the flavors:\n\nFour Loko Bartender Series came in 16 oz. cans and containing 10% ABV, and includes the flavors:\n\nIn April 2017, Four Loko announced a line of hard liquor called \"Four Loko Shots\" that come in 750 ml bottles and are 70 proof (35% ABV).\n\nIn 2009, a group of US state attorneys general began active investigations of companies which produced and sold caffeinated alcohol beverages, on the grounds that they were being inappropriately marketed to a teenage audience and that they had possible health risks (blackouts). The attorneys general were also concerned that these drinks could pose health risks by masking feelings of intoxication. In December 2008, Anheuser-Busch, manufacturer of Tilt and Bud Extra, as well as MillerCoors, manufacturer of Sparks, agreed to reformulate their drinks. In 2009, smaller companies such as Phusion fell under investigation because of their rise in market share.\n\nThe drink came under major fire in 2010, as colleges and universities across the United States began to see injuries and blackouts related to the drink's misuse. The University of Rhode Island banned this product from their campus on November 5, 2010. The state of Washington banned Four Loko after nine university students aged 17 to 19 from Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington became ill at a house party in Roslyn, Washington. The students were hospitalized with blood alcohol levels ranging from 0.12 to 0.35 percent (a level of 0.30 percent being considered potentially lethal) and one university student almost died, according to CWU President James L. Gaudino.\n\nIn October 2010, following the hospitalization of seventeen students and six visitors, Ramapo College of New Jersey banned the possession and consumption of Four Loko on its campus. As a result, Worcester State University stopped the sale of all energy drinks, and they as well as Boston College have informed their students of the risks involved in consuming Four beverages. By November 2010 dozens of other colleges and universities sent out notices informing their students to avoid the drink, while several more have placed outright bans on their campuses.\n\nOther efforts to control the statewide use of Four have been under way. \"The Daily Collegian\", Penn State's student newspaper, reported that on November 1, 2010 the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board sent letters to all liquor stores urging distributors to discontinue the sale of the drink. The PLCB also sent letters to all Colleges and Universities warning them of the dangers of the drink. While the board has stopped short of a ban, it has asked retailers to stop selling the drink until U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) findings prove they are safe. Pennsylvania State Representative Vanessa Lowery Brown, however, seeks to introduce legislation to ban alcoholic energy drinks in the state.\n\nSeveral stores, including ShopRite Super Markets, Tops Markets, Price Chopper and Wegmans have voluntarily pulled the product from their shelves. Shortly after these stores did so, former Governor of New York David Paterson announced that Phusion was withdrawing the beverage from the state of New York as of November 19, 2010.\n\nOn November 20, 2010, Oregon Liquor Control Commission's five citizen commissioners held an emergency meeting resulting in a 4-1 vote on the ban. The ban became effective immediately and was in effect until May 18, 2011. The ban required businesses to cease the sale of alcoholic energy drinks and pull existing items off the shelf, immediately. The sale of the restricted products during this period carried a penalty of 30 day suspension of liquor license.\n\nUtah, which has a state-run alcoholic beverage distribution system, did not allow the sale of alcoholic energy drinks. Michigan and Oklahoma have voted to ban the sale of alcohol energy drinks over health and safety concerns. Additionally, the Washington State Liquor Control Board voted to ban the sale of alcoholic energy drinks, which went into effect on November 18, 2010. The vote came as a result of the incident at Central Washington University. The New York State Liquor Authority has also banned their sale and distribution as of November 19, 2010. New York state senator Chuck Schumer and New York City councilman James Sanders Jr. approached the Obama administration to ban Four Loko across the state of New York.\n\nOn November 17, 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to four manufacturers of caffeinated alcohol beverages citing that the caffeine added to their malt alcoholic beverages is an “unsafe food additive” and said that further action, including seizure of their products, may occur under federal law. It declared that beverages that combine caffeine with alcohol, such as Four Loko energy drinks, are a \"public health concern\" and couldn't stay on the market in their current form. The FDA also stated that concerns have been raised that caffeine can mask some of the sensory cues individuals might normally rely on to determine their level of intoxication. Warning letters were issued to each of the four companies requiring them to provide to the FDA in writing within 15 days of the specific steps the firms will be taking.\n\nThe four companies that received the warning letter were:\n\nStarting weeks prior to the FDA ruling, many fans and others seeking financial gain purchased large quantities of the drink. This buying rush quickly created a black market for the drink, with many sellers charging nearly five times the drink's retail price. Four Loko appeared on Craigslist and collectible cans of the drink were being sold on eBay.\n\nIn late December 2010, a reformulated version of the drink was put on shelves. The new product had exactly the same design as the original, but the caffeine, guarana, and taurine (ingredients in the original drink) had been taken out of the formula and replaced by Red 40, a food coloring agent. However, sales of the original drink continued, usually for a price of roughly $3 per 24 ounce can.\n"}

A by-product of aqueous alcohol soy protein concentrate production, soy molasses is a concentrated, desolventized, aqueous alcohol extract of defatted soybean flakes.\n\nThe term \"soy molasses\" was coined by Daniel Chajuss, the founder of Hayes Ashdod Ltd., which first commercially produced and marketed soy molasses in the early 1960s. The name was intended to distinguish the product from “soybean whey” or “condensed soybean solubles”, the by-products available at the time from soy protein isolate and acid washed soy protein concentrate production.\n\nThe alcohols are removed from the liquid extract by evaporation and the distillation residue is an aqueous solution of the sugars and other soy solubles. This solution is concentrated to viscous honey-like consistency to yield soy molasses.\n\nTypically, soy molasses contains 50% total soluble solids. These solids consist of carbohydrates (60%), proteins and other nitrogenous substances (10%), minerals (10%), fats and lipoids (20%). The major constituents of soy molasses are sugars that include oligosaccharides (stachyose and raffinose), disaccharides (sucrose) and minor amounts of monosaccharides (fructose and glucose). Minor constituents include saponins, protein, lipid, minerals (ash), isoflavones, and other organic materials.\n\nSoy molasses is used as a feed ingredient in mixed feeds as pelleting aid, added to soybean meal (e.g. by spraying it into the soybean meal desolventizer toaster), mixed with soy hulls, and used in liquid animal feed diets. Soy molasses can be used as a fermentation aid, as a prebiotic, and as an ingredient in specialized breads.\n\nIt is also possible to burn soy molasses in a dedicated boiler to generate process steam. In combination with a support fuel (e.g. natural gas, ...) the low calorific liquid can be valorized in a steam boiler.\n\nSoy molasses is an important commercial and biological product, and a source of phytochemicals and soy sugars.\n\n"}

Under Nazism, the German government (and its private-sector, Axis, and collaborator partners) used forced labor extensively, starting in the 1930s but most especially during World War II. Another term was Zwangsarbeitslager (\"forced labor camp\").\n\nThe Nazis operated several categories of \"Arbeitslager\" for different categories of inmates. The largest number of them held civilians forcibly abducted in the occupied countries (see Łapanka for Polish context) to provide labour in the German war industry, repair bombed railroads and bridges, or work on farms and in stone quarries. \n\nThe Nazis also operated concentration camps, some of which provided free forced labor for industrial and other jobs while others existed purely for the extermination of their inmates. A notable example is Mittelbau-Dora labor camp complex that serviced the production of the V-2 rocket. See List of German concentration camps for more. The large chemical works at Monowitz and owned by IG Farben was near Auschwitz and was designed to produce synthetic rubber and fuel oil. The labour needed for its construction was supplied by several labour camps around the works. Some of the prisoners were Auschwitz inmates, who were selected for their technical skills, such as Primo Levi for example.\n\n\"Arbeitskommandos\", officially called \"Kriegsgefangenenarbeitskommando\" were sub-camps under Prisoner-of-war camps for holding prisoners of war of lower ranks (below sergeant), who were working in industries and on farms. This was permitted under the Third Geneva Convention provided they were accorded proper treatment. They were not allowed to work in industries manufacturing war materials, but this restriction was frequently ignored by the Germans. They were always under the administration of the parent prisoner-of-war camp, which maintained records, distributed International Red Cross packages and provided at least minimal medical care in the event of the prisoner's sickness or injury. The number of prisoners in an Arbeitskommando was usually between 100 and 300. \n\nOne should differentiate these from sub-camps of Nazi concentration camps operated by the SS, which were also called \"Arbeitskommando\". Because of the two different types there is some confusion in the literature, with the result of occasional reports of prisoners-of-war being held in concentration camps. In some cases the two types were physically adjacent, when both POWs and KL-inmates were working at a large facility such as a coal mine or chemical plant. They were always kept apart from each other.\n\n\n"}

Dadih can also be eaten with hot rice and sambal.\n\nSome studies on probiotic properties of indigenous strains isolated from dadih fermented milk demonstrated to exhibit antimutagenic, acid, and bile tolerance as well as antipathogenic properties. Natural wild strains isolated from dadih show inhibitory, competitive and displacing properties against pathogens, and they are promising candidates for future probiotics. Viable cells of \"Lactobacillus plantarum\" strains from dadih as well as active metabolism play important roles in removing microcystin-LR, cyanobacterial toxin, and natural wild strain of \"Lactobacillus plantarum\" from dadih has the highest removal abilities as compared to the other commercial probiotic strains. This finding offers new and economical tools for decontaminating microcystin containing water.\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally made with either beef or lamb, but in Turkish restaurants and fast food spots only the vegetarian variety made with extra fine bulgur may be served. Ciğ köfte may be served as an appetizer or meze.\n\nIn the beef variant, ground beef is used. Tendons and fat are removed before grinding the beef. Relatively expensive high-quality beef has to be used so that the meat can be safely served raw. London broil or top round are recommended choices for the ground beef.\n\nSince lamb is considered a \"clean meat\", it is often used for çiğ köfte instead of beef. Both Armenians and Turks use çiğ köfte as a meze, served almost cold. The raw meatball, or kofta, is not kept overnight and is reserved for special occasions. The lamb used must be deboned, degristled, and trimmed before it is prepared. The lamb is supposed to be butchered, bought, and prepared the very same day to ensure freshness.\nWith either meat, finely ground bulgur (durum and other wheat) is required. Other ingredients are mild onions, scallions, parsley, and usually green pepper. Variants of the dish may use tomato sauce, Tabasco sauce, and mint leaves. When served, it may be gathered into balls, or in one piece. Crackers or pita bread are sometimes used to consume it.\n\nChi Kofte is considered a delicacy in Cilician Armenian culture and is normally prepared on special occasions, especially during holidays. There are many varieties of chi kofte among Armenian families depending on the historic region they are from and their personal preferences. For example, some may use more or less bulgur, and some may use more or less pepper paste depending on their desired spiciness.\n\nTraditional Armenian chi kofte is made in two varieties, either in loose meatball form in the shape of a small egg, or flattened on a plate with olive oil and minced green onions, similar to kibbeh nayyeh. However, unlike Levantine Arabs, eating chi kofte with bread is not common among Armenians.\n\nA vegetarian variety also exists which is shaped very similarly to chi kofte and with a similar texture. Although it is prepared throughout the year, it is particularly popular during Lent in accordance with the diet restrictions of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nChi kofte was introduced in the United States by Armenian immigrants, and was commonly referred to as \"Armenian steak tartare\". This term is not as common today based on the declining popularity of steak tartare.\n\nIn Turkish, \"çiğ\" means \"raw\" and \"köfte\" means meatball. It is a favorite Turkish snack and a specialty of southeastern Turkey, especially Şanlıurfa and Adıyaman.\n\nBulgur is kneaded with chopped onions and water until it gets soft. Then tomato and pepper paste, spices and very finely ground beef are added. This absolutely fatless raw mincemeat is treated with spices while kneading the mixture, which is said to \"cook\" the meat. Lastly, green onions, fresh mint and parsley are mixed in. Some çiğ köfte makers, particularly in Adıyaman, do not use water in their recipes. Instead of water, they use ice cubes and lemons. One spice that is associated with çiğ köfte, and with Şanlıurfa as a whole, is \"isot\", a very dark, almost blackish paprika, prepared in a special manner, and which is considered as indispensable for an authentically local preparation of çiğ köfte.\n\nA vegetarian version of ciğ köfte may also be made with only bulgur grains. The preparation is similar to the versions that include meat and some cooks also add pomegranate molasses. Depending on the cooks preferences, spices like cumin may be used instead of \"isot\" in the preparation of vegetarian versions.\n\nA favorite way of eating çiğ köfte is rolled in a lettuce leaf, accompanied with good quantities of ayran to counter-act the burning sensation that this very spicy food will give.\n\nAlthough traditional recipe requires minced -raw- meat, the version in Turkey consumed as fast-food (through small franchise shops in every neighborhood of Turkey) must be meatless by law due to hygienic necessities. Therefore, çiğ köfte is, unless restaurant or home-made, vegan in Turkey. Meat is replaced by ground walnuts, hazelnuts and potato.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6722287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6722287", "title": "Public records in China", "text": "Public records in China\n\nDang'an () is a Chinese word meaning \"record\". Used in the political and administrative context, it means a permanent dossier or archival system that records the \"performance and attitudes\" of citizens of mainland China. Together with the current system of household registration, the Hukou system, it has been an important part of the government's efforts to maintain control of its people. Majority of the records are kept by the local archive bureaus, some by the State Archives Administration of China at the national level.\n\nThe Dang'an includes personal information such as physical characteristics, employment record, photograph, etc. However, it also contains many other documents that would be considered private in some other cultures. According to Wang Fei-ling and other sources, this includes appraisals by supervisors and peers, academic reports from primary school to university, professional credentials, any criminal convictions or administrative penalties, club/society memberships, employment records and political history (such as Youth League and CPC membership and assessments). Some of the material is composed by the subject. Even the death certificate and eulogy may be placed in the file.\n\nThere are two copies for adults: one held on behalf of their work unit by its supervisory organization, and the other at the local Public Security Bureau (PSB). Access to dang'an is strictly controlled. Citizens do not usually see their dang'an, although they may ask a Communist Party member to check it for them. Alterations may only be carried out by special cadres, and when combined with the custom of guanxi the result is that \"Personal revenge, false entries and special favors are thus part of the game.\"\n\nA Montreal-based human rights group has claimed that the PSB is in the process of computerizing the hundreds of millions of dang'an.\n\nDuring the Maoist era, these dossiers were consulted by work unit officials as they made decisions about the major life events of those under their control. Urban residents were assigned jobs by the state. Thereafter, permission from the work unit was needed for marriage, childbirth and transferring the dang'an (i.e., changing workplace). During the Cultural Revolution era, there even used to determine which individuals and families would be sent to carry out manual labour in the countryside, under the \"theory of bloodlines\". As late as 2003, academic Zhou Jinghao could write that \"A work unit controls employees basically through the dang'an (personnel dossier) system. An employee cannot transfer to another work unit without his dang'an.\"\n\nAs Chinese economic reform has proceeded, the situation has been less clear-cut, as the dang'an system conflicts with market-oriented labour contracts. Graduates have been able to choose their own employment since the mid-1990s in most regions (the latest, Tibet, in 2006), and marriage has not required work unit consent since 2003. Some private companies in prosperous Guangdong do not even require access to the files, which remains with the employee's neighbourhood committee. However, individuals may still be granted or denied passports, promotions and other benefits based on information in their dang'an. According to BBC journalist Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, \"A black mark against you – a bad school report, a disagreement with your boss, a visit to a psychiatrist – all can travel with you for the rest of your life...\" They are also used in investigations by the Ministry of State Security.\n\nAn embryonic dang'an is created when individuals enter the school system. This is similar to the permanent file of a school student in some Western school systems, and is transferred from school to school, but in China it is required for entry to university or a work unit, to which the file is then transferred. Millions of peasants, who work on family farms or in small businesses, never acquire a dang'an. Those who do are classified as either cadres (Chinese: \"ganbu\") or workers (Chinese: \"gōngrén\"). It is difficult to cross this boundary.\n\nAccording to Zhou, \"private and foreign-funded enterprises are no longer required to receive the dang'an when they hire employees.\" Instead, foreign firms transfer them to the Ministry of Commerce.\n\nThe future of dang'an was questioned by Qiao Shi, P.R.China's number three leader in the mid-90s. In 1996, he proposed to the National People's Congress that the dang'an system be abolished. Both Qiao and the proposal fell out of favour the following year.\n\nAmerican education activist John Taylor Gatto, for example, draws comparisons to dang'an in his critique of the United States school system.\n\nIn 2015, the \"Financial Times\" reported that the 13th Five Year Plan, planned for the period 2016-2020, includes plans to establish a \"centralised repository for citizen information\" to \"the creation of a robust [national] socio-psychological service system.\" This system has subsequently been referred to in English-language press accounts as the \"social credit system\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6729267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6729267", "title": "Oyibo", "text": "Oyibo\n\n\"Oyinbo\"' is a word used in Yoruba and Nigerian Pidgin to refer to white people. In Nigeria, it is generally used to refer to a person of European descent or people perceived to not be culturally African. The word is pronounced \"oyinbo\" in Yoruba speaking areas and \"oyibo\" in Igbo language. Both terms are valid in Pidgin English.\n\nThe origin of the word is difficult to ascertain. It is believed that the word was coined from the Yoruba translation of “peeled skin” or “skinless,” which, in Yoruba, translates to “yin” – scratch “bo” – off/peel; the \"O\" starting the word \"Oyinbo\" is a pronoun. Hence, \"Oyinbo\" literally translates to \"the man with a peeled off skin\". Other variations of the term in Yoruba language include Eyinbo, which is usually shorted as \"Eebo\".\n\nIn the Igbo language, a demonym takes the form “onye” + “place of origin.” Hence, whereas an Igbo person is called “onye Igbo,” a Yoruba is called “onye Yoruba” and a German “onye Germany.” Thus, the first white people were called either “onye ocha” (singular) or “ndi ocha” (plural), for “white person” and “white people,” respectively. This was because the Igbos of those days did not know where the white people came from. Interaction between the Igbos and the white people resulted in the white people trying to refer to the Igbos with a name similar to what the Igbos called them but they had problems in pronouncing Igbo words due to the presence of double lettered alphabets, which involve nasal pronunciation in some of the consonants, such as 'ch', 'gb', 'gh', 'gw', 'kp', 'kw', 'nw', 'ny', 'sh'. These are not present in the English language, hence the difficulty in the European man's effort in giving the Igbos a similar demonym as the Igbo people had given to him; instead, a name resulting from a mutilation of Igbo words was produced \"oyi Ibo\" instead of \"onyi Igbo\", meaning 'Igbo person'. The Igbos later started referring to white persons as 'oyi Ibo' as a way of mocking the white man for his inability to say \"onye Igbo\". This would later be adopted by other Southern Nigerian tribes as the standard name for the white man and coupled with dialect variance, one obtains different pronunciations such as \"Oyinbo' in Yoruba and other western Nigerian tribes. Also, 'Oyibo' means English Language in Igbo. In general usage, it may refer to individuals with various skin complaints such as vitiligo or genetic conditions such as albinism.\n\nOyibo is also used in reference to people who are foreign or Europeanised, including Saros in the Igbo towns of Port Harcourt, Onitsha and Enugu in the late 19th and early 20th century. Sierra Leonean missionaries, according to Ajayi Crowther, a Yoruba, and John Taylor, an Igbo, descendants of repatriated slaves, were referred to as \"oyibo ojii\" () or \"native foreigners\" by the people of Onitsha in the late 19th century.\n\nOlaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, claimed in his 1789 narrative that the people in \"Essaka\", Igboland, where he claimed to be from, had used the term \"Oye-Eboe\" in reference to \"red men living at a distance\" which may possibly be an earlier version of \"oyibo\". Equiano's use of \"Oye-Eboe\", however, was in reference to other Africans and not white men. Gloria Chuku suggests that Equiano's use of \"Oye-Eboe\" is not linked to \"oyibo\", and that it is a reference to the generic term Onitsha and other more westerly Igbo people referred to other Igbo people. R. A. K. Oldfield, a European, while on the Niger River near Aboh in 1832 had recorded locals calling out to him and his entourage \"Oh, Eboe! Oh, Eboe!\", meaning \"White man, White man!\" and linked to modern 'oyibo'.\n\nThe word may also be said to be a corruption of the Edo word ‘ovbiebo,’ a blend of two words: ‘ovbi,’ meaning ‘child’ or ‘indigene,’ and ‘ebo,’ the Edo word for Caucasian. Other southern Nigerian tribes may have found it difficult to pronounce the ‘vbi’ consonant, corrupting ‘vbi’ to ‘yi’ or ‘yin,' with 'oyibo' and 'oyinbo' eventually coming to replace the original Edo coinage.\n\nIn Central and West Africa the name for a person of European descent is \"Toubab\".\n\nIn Ghana the word used for a 'white' person or foreigner is 'Obroni' in the local languages, those of the Akan family.\n"}

In the Hindu religion, it is the ritual that one performs to pay homage to one's 'ancestors' (Sanskrit: Pitṛs), especially to one's dead parents. Conceptually, it is a way for people to express heartfelt gratitude and thanks towards their parents and ancestors, for having helped them to be what they are and praying for their peace. It also can be thought of as a \"day of remembrance\". It is performed for both the father and mother separately, on the days they became deceased. It is performed on the death anniversary or collectively during the Pitru Paksha or \"Shraaddha\" paksha (Fortnight of ancestors), right before \"Sharad Navaratri\" in autumn.\n\nIn practice, the karta (person who performs the Śrāddha) invites Brahmanaas (priests) and his relatives and friends that day, treats Brahmanaas (priests) as his/her parent, performs a homa (fire ritual), and offers balls of rice to the departed souls (\"pinda pradaana\", offered to the Pitṛs, the ancestral spirits). The karta serves the priest with sumptuous food, treating them with all hospitality, and concludes the ceremony by giving \"dakshina\" (fees) to the brahmanaas. (There are various other actions done to show respect to the Brahmanaas, like washing their feet etc. during the course of shraaddha). Cows are also considered ancestors in Hinduism and during Śrāddha the practice of offering food or pinda to cows is still in vogue.\n\nSince this is one of the more important and noble \"\" (rituals meant to cleanse the mind and soul) that the Hindu sages have envisaged, it is imperative that the performer of the ritual understands what he or she is doing. Only then will the true intent of the ritual be fulfilled and the performer of the ritual feel completely gratified. Else, the ritual becomes just a mechanical exercise for one's part.\n\nIn Hindu \"amanta\" calendar ( ending with \"amavasya\" ), second half of the month \"Bhadrapada\" is called Pitru Paksha: \"Pitripaksha\" or \"Shraddha paksha\" and its \"amavasya\" ( new moon ) is called \"sarvapitri amavasya\". This part is considered inauspicious in \"muhurtshashtra\" (electional astrology).

{"id": "6747934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6747934", "title": "Sand dune ecology", "text": "Sand dune ecology\n\nSand dune ecology describes the biological and physico-chemical interactions that are a characteristic of sand dunes.\n\nSand dune systems are excellent places for biodiversity, partly because they are not very productive for agriculture, and partly because disturbed, stressful and stable habitats are present in proximity to each other. Many of them are protected as nature reserves, and some are parts of larger conservation areas, incorporating other coastal habitats like salt marches, mud flats, grasslands, scrub and woodland.\n\nSand dunes provide a range of habitats for a range of unusual, interesting and characteristic plants that can cope with disturbed habitats. In the UK these may include restharrow \"Ononis repens\", sand spurge \"Euphorbia arenaria\" and ragwort \"Senecio vulgaris\" - such plants are termed ruderals.\n\nOther very specialised plants are adapted to the accretion of sand, surviving the continual burial of their shoots by sending up very rapid vertical growth. Marram grass, \"Ammophila arenaria\" specialises in this, and is largely responsible for the formation and stabilisation of many dunes by binding sand grains together. The sand couch-grass \"Elytrigia juncea\" also performs this function on the seaward edge of the dunes, and is responsible, with some other pioneers like the sea rocket \"Cakile maritima\", for initiating the process of dune building by trapping wind blown sand.\n\nIn accreting situations small mounds of vegetation or tide-washed debris form and tend to enlarge as the wind-speed drops in the lee of the mound, allowing blowing sand (picked up from the off-shore banks) to fall out of the air stream. The pioneering plants are physiologically adapted to withstand the problems of high salt contents in the air and soil, and are good examples of stress tolerators, as well as having some ruderal characteristics.\n\nOn the inland side of dunes conditions are less severe, and links type grasslands develop with a range of grassland herbs which benefit from the reasonable nutrient status and moderately high pH of the more stable soils, especially when enough humus has accumulated in stabilised soils for water retention to be improved. Species like red fescue and lady's bedstraw are adapted to compete with each other - for nutrients, growing space and light, and are known as CSR plants - i.e. having features of Competitors, Stress tolerators and Ruderals in more or less equal proportions.\n\nThere may also be areas in old blow-outs where groundwater is near the surface, and often rises to cause flooding in the winter. Frequent, but intermittent waterlogging of the roots requires adaptations to stress, so the proportions of stress tolerators are increased here.\n\nIn nutrient-rich water, however there are some plants with very competitive strategies, like the reed (\"Phragmites australis\"). This is an example of a plant which makes rapid growth and suppresses other species by monopolising root and shoot space and shading out the opposition. Even its own seedlings are prevented from establishing within the existing population, but seeds are blown for long distances in copious quantities to start new colonies, whilst mature populations extend by rapid vegetative growth of lateral underground shoots - rhizomes.\n\n"}
{"id": "6750119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6750119", "title": "‘aiga", "text": "‘aiga\n\n‘Aiga is a word in the Samoan language which means 'family.' The \"aiga\" is the family unit of Samoan society and differs from the Western sense in that it consists of more than just a mother, father and children. The Samoan family, also referred to as an 'extended family' is based on the culture's communal socio-political organisation. Aiga consists of a wider family group of blood and marriage or even adopted connections who all acknowledge the \"matai\" (head of the family). Such a \"matai\" is a titled person, either a chief (\"ali'i\") or an orator (\"tulafale\" or \"failauga\") whose particular duty is the leadership and care of the family under their control, and who is entitled to the services and co-operation of all members of their family in return for leadership. In Samoan custom relationship may be claimed through female as well as male ancestors. Samoans may belong to many families or different \"aiga\" since a woman marrying into another family confers on all her blood descendants membership of her own. \n\nA \"matai\" may be either male or female and they are selected by consensus of the 'aiga and bestowed the particular \"matai title\" belonging to that family. All members of such a family group need not necessarily live under the same roof or even in the same village but will when occasion requires it assemble, generally at the residence of the \"matai\", to discuss family affairs or any happenings affecting the interests of the family, or to discharge the duties associated with deaths or weddings. It is the duty of the \"matai\" to take care of the family land and to apportion it for the use of members of the family in return for services rendered to them as head of the family.\n\nAll outward expressions of the respect and esteem in which an \"aiga\" may be held both by the village and the district or the whole of Samoa, may properly be directed to the \"matai\". They are the trustee of the good name of the family and the fountain-head to which all ceremonial recognition of the status of the family is due. \"Matai\" are also responsible for the proper maintenance of the dignity of the family and the adequate performance of their social obligations. If the \"matai\" is not shown proper respect on any occasion, that omission is resented as a slight to the family themselves. On the other hand, if the conduct of the \"matai\" in any way falls short of the standard expected, the displeasure of the community and the shame associated therewith will be shared by the family.\n\nAnother aspect of family organisation which is very important indeed in Samoan custom, is that which deals with the male and female lines of descent of a family.

{"id": "6754266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6754266", "title": "Quarter sawing", "text": "Quarter sawing\n\nQuarter sawing also quarter-cut is a type of cut in the rip-sawing of logs into lumber. The resulting lumber is called \"quartersawn\" (quarter-sawn), \"quartered\", and \"radially-sawn\". There is widespread confusion between the terms quartersawn and \"riftsawn\" with both words defined with opposite meanings and as synonyms.\n\nQuarter-sawn boards have greater stability of form and size with less cupping, shrinkage across the width, shake and splitting, and other good qualities. In some woods, such as oak, the grain produces a decorative effect which shows a prominent ray fleck and sapele is likely to produce a ribbon figure.\n\nWhen boards are cut from a log they are usually rip cut along the length (axis) of the log. This can be done in three ways: plain-sawing (most common, also known as flat-sawn, bastard-sawn, through and through, and tangent-sawn), quarter-sawing (less common), or rift sawing (rare).\n\nIn flat-sawing the log is passed through the blade cutting off plank after plank without changing the orientation of the blade or log. The resulting planks have different annual ring orientations when viewed from the end. The relative angle that form the rings and the surface go from almost zero degrees in the external planks to almost ninety degrees at the core of the log.\n\nQuarter sawing gets its name from the fact that the log is first quartered lengthwise, resulting in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with straight striped grain lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive ray and fleck figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is first quartered, which is more wasteful.\n\nQuartersawn boards can also be produced by cutting a board from one flat face of the quarter, flipping the wedge onto the other flat face to cut the next board, and so on.\n\nThe William Ritter Lumber Company (1890–1960), famous for its Appalachian oak flooring and other products, used a modified technique to reduce waste: (1) bark and a few boards were removed from two opposite sides of the log; (2) the log was cut in half \"(possibly, four quarters)\"; (3) each piece was placed on the flat side and \"quartersawn\" lumber was cut. \"(Note: no reference is made in this source to the notion of \"flipping the wedge\" as described in the preceding paragraph. Apparently, the cuts were made without \"flipping.\")\"\n\nQuarter sawing is sometimes confused with the much less common \"rift sawing.\" In quartersawn wood, only the center board of the quarter-log is cut with the growth rings truly perpendicular to the surface of the board. The smaller boards cut from either side have grain increasingly skewed. Riftsawn wood has every board cut along a radius of the original log, so each board has a perpendicular grain, with the growth rings oriented at right angles to the surface of the board. However, since this produces a great deal of waste (in the form of wedge-shaped scraps from between the boards) rift-sawing is very seldom used. Quartersawn wood is thus seen as an acceptable compromise between economical but less-stable flatsawn wood (which, especially in oak, will often display the distinct \"cathedral window\" grain) and the expensively-wasteful rift sawn wood, which has the straightest grain and thus the greatest stability.\n\nQuartersawn boards have two advantages: they are more resistant against warping with changes in moisture and, while shrinkage can occur, it is less troublesome.\n\nIn high-end string instruments, the neck and fretboards can be made from quartersawn wood since they must remain stable throughout the life of the instrument, to keep the tone as invariable as possible. In acoustic guitars, quartersawn wood is also often used for the sides which must be steam bent to produce compound curves. This is partly for structural reasons, but also for the aesthetics of highly figured timbers being highlighted when sawn this way. On high-end electric guitars and bass guitars quartersawn wood is often used as the base material for the neck of the guitar, since this makes for a stronger and straighter neck which aids tuning and setup stability.\n\nThe second advantage of quartersawn wood is the decorative pattern on the board, although this depends on the timber species. Flat sawn wood (especially oak) will often display a prominent wavy grain (sometimes called a cathedral-window pattern) caused by the saw cutting at a tangent to a growth ring; since in quartersawn wood the saw cuts across the growth rings, the visible grain is much straighter; it is this evenness of the grain that gives quartersawn wood its greater stability.\n\nIn addition to the grain, quartersawn wood (particularly oak) will also often display a pattern of medullary rays, seen as subtle wavy ribbon-like patterns across the straight grain. Medullary rays grow in a radial fashion in the living tree, so while flat-sawing would cut across the rays, quarter-sawing puts them on the face of the board. This ray pattern has made quartersawn wood especially desirable for furniture and decorative panelling.\n\nQuartersawn oak was a key feature of the decorative style of the American Arts and Crafts movement, particularly the work of Gustav Stickley, who said \"The quartersawing method of cutting... renders quartersawn oak structurally stronger, also finer in grain, and, as shown before, less liable to warp and check than when sawn in any other way.\" Cheaper copies of Stickley's furniture were sometimes made with the less-expensive ash stained to resemble oak, but it can be identified by its lack of rays.\n\nWood cut in this way is prized for certain applications, but it will tend to be more expensive as well. In cutting a log, quarter sawn boards can be produced in several ways, but if a log is cut for maximum yield it will produce only a few quarter sawn boards among the total; if a log is cut to produce only quarter sawn boards there will be considerable waste.\n\nThe process indicated in the US as \"quarter sawing\" yields a few boards that are quartersawn, but mostly rift sawn boards.\n\n"}

When baked, these ingredients combine into a homogeneous mixture similar to caramel. If maple syrup is used, it might be referred to as maple pie. The ideal sugar cream pie is supposed to be like Santa Claus in that it should shake \"like a bowl full of jelly.\" The name \"finger pie\" for the dessert was due to stirring the pie during baking with one's finger; it was stirred this way to avoid breaking the crust.\n\nThe European version is vaguely reminiscent of an American \"transparent pie\" (the name in the Midwestern and Southern United States for a version of pecan pie without the pecans), of English Canadian butter tarts, or of English treacle tart.\n\nThe Indiana version of a sugar pie, known as \"sugar cream pie\", is believed to have originated with Quaker settlers who came from North Carolina in the early 19th century, and thereafter settled in east-central Indiana, particularly around the cities of New Castle, Portland, Richmond, and Winchester.\n\nThe Amish also popularized sugar cream pie, making the pie easy to find where they populated. In particular, the pie is a favorite in the Pennsylvania Dutch areas, much as is shoofly pie, a similar dessert. Shakers also have a variant of the pie. However, as the Shakers had to abandon their community of West Union (Busro) (near modern-day Vincennes, Indiana) in 1827, their only presence in Indiana ever (1810–1827), it is unlikely that they made the dessert popular in the state.\n\nThe largest producer of these pies is Wick's Pies, whose plant is in Winchester, Indiana, and makes 750,000 sugar cream pies a year. Every eight-hour shift, over 12,000 of the pies are made. They are recognizable for their nutmeg dusting and shallow depth in a disposable aluminum pan. The recipe Wick's uses came directly from a family recipe originating from the nineteenth century. The pies sell in 25 states.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6759688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6759688", "title": "Duff Beer", "text": "Duff Beer\n\nDuff Beer is a brand of beer that originated as a fictional beverage on the animated series \"The Simpsons\". Beers using the Duff branding have been brewed in a number of countries, resulting in legal battles with varying results. An official version of the beer is sold in three variations near the Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios. In 2015, 21st Century Fox, producer of \"The Simpsons\", began selling licensed Duff beer in Chile, with a view to driving out brandjacking.\n\nIn 2016, \"Time\" included Duff Beer in a list of the most influential fictional companies of all time.\n\nDuff is Homer Simpson's beer of choice. It is a parody of stereotypical mass-market American lager: cheap, poor-quality, and heavily marketed.\n\nThe beer's slogan is \"Can't Get Enough of That Wonderful Duff\", though there are others. In \"Duffless\", parking lot signs at the Duff brewery have the slogans \"It's Always Time For Duff\" and \"Now Leaving Duff Country\". In \"Homer's Odyssey\", Duff is described as \"The beer that makes the days fly by\".\n\nTheir spokesperson is Duffman, a parody of Budweiser's '70s-era mascot Bud Man. He is a muscular, bleach-blond, well-tanned man with whitened teeth who wears a blue leotard and cape, red Duff Beer ballcap, mirror sunglasses, and a utility belt full of cans of Duff Beer. He speaks in a loud and overly-enthusiastic staccato voice (like a radio DJ or beer commercial pitchman) and does a lot of exaggerated physical movements like a male exotic dancer - like dancing in place, groin-thrusting, hip shaking, and rubbing his buttocks with a towel. There are apparently many identical Duffmen; however, like mall Santas they never appear at the same place at the same time (to not disillusion the kids). One retired Duffman in Alcoholics Anonymous referred to himself as \"Barry Duffman\", indicating that he had to assume the identity of Duffman as part of the job. Some of the actors who play him have actually died (presumably from alcohol-related causes); their demise was never acknowledged because the character of Duffman is unaging and immortal. At public appearances he is often flanked by a random pair of beautiful, scantily-clad women who act as arm-candy, backup dancers, and assistants.\n\nWhile Duff Beer comes in several varieties, it is revealed on a Duff Brewery tour in \"Duffless\" that regular Duff, Duff Light, and Duff Dry are the same beer, although Homer and Barney apparently remain oblivious to the fact. A tasting room contains Duff Dark beer and Duff Gummy Beers candy; it also contains several varieties that Barney stated they had not tried yet: Raspberry Duff, Lady Duff and Tartar Control Duff.\n\nIn \"A Tree Grows in Springfield\", Homer asks for Moe's best beer, so Moe gives him a Duff Adequate. In \"The Great Louse Detective\", Duffman claims that Duff Stout is \"the beer that made Ireland famous\".\n\nIn \"Homer the Moe\", Moe sells \"Malaysian Duff\", which is made with soy sauce at his trendy bar. In \"The Springfield Files\", Homer is craving something different than the usual Duff. So Moe gives Homer a bottle of \"Düff\" (Swedish Duff) - it's just a can of regular Duff with the accent mark drawn on in marker pen.\n\nIn \"The War of Art\", Homer offers Kirk Van Houten a bottle of Canadian Duff (or \"Le Duff avec Codeine\" on the label in French), which is laced with Cough Medicine. The label on the bottle's neck has a picture of Canadian Duffman wearing a Mountie uniform and saying his catch phrase in both English (\"Oh Yeah!\") and French (\"Mais Oui!\"). The cough syrup is most likely a reference to the fact that off-the-shelf cough syrup in Canada commonly contained codeine at the time the episode aired (prior to 2018), while in the USA, such syrups are only available over the counter.\n\nIn \"Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk\", Homer celebrates a recent minor stock windfall by ordering a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve, which is implied to be more costly and of better quality, and which is an apparent spoof of Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve. \n\nIn the season 21 episode \"To Surveil With Love\", Duffman makes a giveaway of Duff advertising in Moe's bar while \"Get Ready For This\" by 2 Unlimited plays on the background, suggesting this might be the theme song for the beer brand or for the character.\n\nFudd, a competitor to Duff, appears in the episodes \"Colonel Homer\" and \"Lemon of Troy\", the latter showing it being enjoyed by residents of Shelbyville, rival town to the Simpsons' home of Springfield. Consumption of Fudd however is alleged by bartender Moe Szyslak to have made hillbillies go blind.\n\nIn the episode entitled \"Selma's Choice\", Bart and Lisa Simpson travel with their aunt Selma to Duff Gardens, a parody of the Busch Gardens amusement park, but also containing elements of Disneyland. In the gift shop, Bart spots \"beer goggles\", spectacles that mimic what drunks see: they make Aunt Selma appear young, feminine, and beautiful to Bart - and also, somehow, alter her voice. Later, they see the mascots of Duff Beer, the Seven Duffs.\n\nIn the same episode, there is also a direct parody of the \"It's a Small World\" attraction at Disney parks. In the cartoon, the boats float on a brown liquid as animatronic children sing \"\"Duff beer for me, Duff beer for you, I'll have a Duff, You have one, too,\"\" over and over again. Lisa drinks the liquid in the ride on a dare from Bart, and she freaks out from its hallucinogenic properties.\n\nOther Duff Gardens attractions include the Beeramid, the Beerquarium (\"Home of the world's happiest fish\"), the Beer Hall of Presidents, the Washing Machine ride, the Whiplash rollercoaster, singing group Hooray for Everything (who sing a politically correct version of Lou Reed's \"Walk on the Wild Side\" and are based on Up with People), and a direct parody of Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade.\n\nThe Seven Duffs are characters at the Duff Gardens theme park. The \"Duffs\" are a reference to Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". The Seven Duffs are named Sleazy, Queasy, Surly, Edgy, Tipsy, Dizzy, and Remorseful.\n\nSome have speculated that the name was inspired by one-syllable beer names in the United States (such as \"Bud\"), and \"The Simpsons\"' writers had found the name humorous. However, longtime Simpsons animator, producer, and director David Silverman has stated that Groening named the beer \"Duff\" simply for the convenient rhyme in the slogan \"Can't Get Enough of that Wonderful Duff\".\n\nIn an excerpt from his autobiography, Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan claimed that the beer was named after him as the writers were fans of the band and he was known for his extreme alcohol consumption and was popularly called \"The King of Beers\". This is a claim \"Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening has called \"absurd\". In response McKagan has stated that he thought it was common knowledge and uncontroversial that he was the origin of the name, and jokingly called assertions to the contrary \"absurd.\"\n\nIn fact, Moe's Tavern is a very close recreation of a tavern that was a block from the University of Oregon when Groening was there, called Duffy's. It even had red and green diamond pane windows inside. The beer of choice was Blitz Weinhard, aka Blitz.\n\nMatt Groening has stated that he will not license the Duff trademark to brew an actual beer, over concern that it would encourage children to drink. However, there have been a few notable cases of individual companies and persons who have used the term \"Duff Beer\" with varying success.\n\nDuff's Famous Wings in Buffalo and Rochester, New York sells their own form of Duff's beer on tap.\n\nBilbo's pizza and brewery in Kalamazoo, Michigan also brewed their own form of Duff beer, which had a Homer Simpson tap handle to complete the reference.\n\nOn June 1, 2013, Universal Studios Florida began offering Duff Beer in their expanded Springfield area at a replica of Moe's Tavern and a waterfront Duff Brewery.\n\nIn Germany the Eschweger Klosterbrauerei, a brewery in Hessen, brewed a Duff Beer under the German Reinheitsgebot, under contract for Duff Beer UG. It was distributed in many European countries, and in Australia from 2011.\n\nDuff Beer UG applied for an EU Community Trade Mark (CTM) in 2009, which was opposed by Twentieth Century Fox. In 2011 the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market decided in favour of Fox, and in 2012 Duff Beer UG appealed to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\n\nTwentieth Century Fox had itself been granted a CTM for the logo \"Duff BEER\" for use in several categories of non-beer merchandise. Fox had applied for the CTM in 1999, but opposition from the makers of \"Mac Duff's\"-branded wine and spirits delayed the grant till 2006. Fox's CTM was cancelled by the OHIM in 2011, following a 2010 ruling by the Brussels Commercial Court that a \"Beer\" logo applied exclusively to non-beer merchandise was misleading.\n\nIn 2014, Duff Beer UG's CTM was transferred to Fox, and the ECJ case was withdrawn. There was also a German trademark registered in 1999 to Duff Beverage GmbH, creating what one lawyer in 2015 called a \"very complex situation\".\n\nDaleside Brewery in England makes a beer called Duff.\nDuff Beer UG's beer is distributed in the United Kingdom as \"The Legendary Duff Beer\". While news reports of its 2011 introduction mentioned \"The Simpsons\", its own website does not, although it refers to its \"iconic packaging\" and states \"The product has certainly fulfilled its namesake in becoming a modern day legend\".\n\nIn the mid 1990s, the Lion Nathan brewery in Australia produced a beer called Duff. 20th Century Fox brought legal action against the company. The product was ordered to be pulled from store shelves and destroyed, because of the likely association in public mind between the \"Simpsons\" brand and characters and Lion Nathan's product, though the manufacturer did not use any \"Simpsons\" characters or the \"Simpsons\" Duff Beer design. The beer became a collectors' item in the process, with one case selling for US$13,000.\n\nDuff Beer UG's beer was introduced in Australia in 2011.\n\nOn September 8, 2014 another incarnation of Duff which had only been launched in May 2014 for sale through the Woolworths chain was pulled from Australian shelves due to a complaint to Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code adjudication panel.\n\nThe Investigations Police of Chile seized 60,000 bottles of Duff-brand beer in the city of Linares following an intellectual property complaint from 20th Century Fox in March 2013.\n\nPartially due to unauthorized Duff beer in the country, Fox announced plans to sell official Duff beer in Chile starting in early 2016, with plans to expand elsewhere in South America and into Europe. Producing a real Duff beer will allow Fox stronger trademark protections of the Duff name; as a fictional product, it is more susceptible to piracy.\n\nSince 2006, Rodrigo Contreras, from Guadalajara, Mexico is setting up a business with the purpose of selling Duff beer. He managed to register the \"Duff\" trademark in Mexico, as well as the domain name DuffDeMexico.com. Contreras designed the bottle to be identical to the one portrayed on \"The Simpsons\". The bottle can be seen at his website. The beer is currently available at a few bars, but Contreras has stated his intention of selling it at convenience stores and even exporting it to the United States.\n\nThis case has been featured on several Mexican newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the novelty the beer represents, rather than the legal implications of it. The \"Duff\" trademark was not registered in Mexico before Contreras registered it; however, Mexican intellectual property law recognizes the concept of \"brand notoriety\", which states that if any brand is well known by a specific section of the consumers or the industry due to the commercial activities or advertisement done by its owners, they have the right to claim the ownership of the trademark.\n\nSince its inception, the Mexican brand Duff has spread to other countries in Latin-America like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, among others. In some countries, the legal implications and intellectual property is being questioned by Fox representatives, but no court decision has been met yet.\n\nDuff Beer UG's beer was introduced into France in 2011, though with limited success. Since French television has a strict prohibition on advertising and product placement of alcohol, subsequent broadcasts of \"The Simpsons\" have blurred the Duff logo on screen. The name is not censored on the soundtrack, but Duffman was redubbed \"Uffman\".\n\nDuff Brewery in Dunedin, New Zealand brewed Duff Beer many years before \"The Simpsons\", but due to threatened legal action by Fox they negotiated at name to McDuff.\n\nThe gift shop of The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios sells a canned energy drink made by Boston America Corp. that is designed to look like a Duff Beer can. It is also sold at a limited number of other locations, including Five Below, 2nd & Charles, and in the UK at American import stores such as Cybercandy, and Bootleggers.\n"}

The brand has won many accolades and awards for its products.\n\nThe world's second highest selling Scotch whisky, it has historically been strong in Southern Europe, where it was among the first Scotch whiskies to gain a foothold in the market.\n\nBallantine's Scotch whisky can trace its heritage back to 1827, when farmer's son George Ballantine set up a small grocery store in Edinburgh supplying a range of whiskies to his clientele.\nIn 1865 George delegated the store's operation to his eldest son, Archibald, while he opened a larger establishment in Glasgow. Here he concentrated on the wine and spirit trade, catering to clients that included the Hindu Royal Family. He also began to create his own blends. These inspired additional demand, drawing second son, George junior, into the business. Trading as \"George Ballantine and Son Ltd\", the firm added a bonded warehouse and began to export their Scotch. George senior retired in 1881 and died 10 years later at age 83 with George junior taking over.\n\nBusiness thrived under George junior, and the family sold out profitably to the firm of Barclay and McKinlay in 1919. Building on the reputation and goodwill of the \"Ballantine's\" name, the new owners focused on developing it as a brand for their blended whiskies. When increasing resources were needed to compete fully in the growing world market, the internationally experienced Canadian distilling concern of Hiram Walker Gooderham & Worts acquired Ballantine's in 1937. The next year the company received the Grant of Heraldic Arms featured on their bottles, recognising George Ballantine & Son as an \"incorporation noble on the Noblesse of Scotland\".\n\nThe new owners' first task was to secure fillings, to which end the Miltonduff and Glenburgie Distilleries were purchased, and a massive new grain distillery – the largest in Europe – built at Dumbarton. \nDuring the 1960s the company turned to Europe - at that time an unexplored market for Scotch whisky – and by 1965 had secured such a strong foothold there that it resolved to gear the home trade to supporting the overseas business.\n\nStrong distribution and the popularity of Scotch whisky in the mid-1980s were key influencers in growth. Ballantine's was named the number one brand in Europe and the third largest in the world in 1986 with the oldest product Ballantine's Finest. In Korea, Ballantine's is the clear number one in the super-premium category with its ever-popular Ballantine's 17 in addition to 21 and 30. In 1988, the Company became part of the global beverage conglomerate Allied Domecq.\n\nIn 2002 the large Dumbarton Grain distillery was mothballed, with production shifting to the Strathclyde Grain distillery in the Gorbals of Glasgow. In 2005 Ballantine's was acquired by Pernod Ricard. Ballantines still maintain a large bonded warehouse complex in Dumbarton East and a bottling plant to the North of the town.\n\nIn 2006, Sandy Hyslop was appointed as Ballantine's Master Blender – the 5th Master Blender in Ballantine's 180-year history.\n\nBallantine's produces a range of seven expressions with various characteristics and age statements:\n\n\n\n"}

When the whole round tortilla is baked or fried it is generally known as a tostada.\n\nAn important feature of the baking and salting process is preservation. To prevent the decomposition of the corn and growth of mold, regular tortillas generally need to be eaten the same day as they are made (or stored cold) due to the moisture content, whereas totopos may be stored for future consumption, in the same manner as dry crackers.\n\nIn some cases, fried tortilla chips commercially made both in Mexico and the United States are labeled as or referred to as \"totopos\", although they are not made in the manner of the Oaxacan totopo.\n\nThe name, \"totopo\", comes from the Aztec (or Nahuatl) \"tlaxcaltotopochtl\".

In Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean coast of Colombia, and Panama, it is similar to a tamale. In Central American cuisine, it more closely resembles a British pasty or an Italian calzone. In other Spanish-speaking countries, \"pastel\" is a generic term for pastry. In Hawaii, they are called \"pateles\" in a phonetic rendering of the Puerto Rican pronunciation of \"pasteles\", as discussed below.\n\nColombian pasteles are called \"pastel de arroz cartagenero\" (rice pasteles) and are more of a tamale than a typical pastel. Is made up of rice that is seasoned and left out in the sun; a process referred to as \"orear\" (to air). The rice is then mixed with many ingredients. Pickled vegetables, chorizo, pork, chickpeas, olives, and potatoes are the most common. Chicken and beef are also used. Colombian pasteles are wrapped twice, once with a cabbage leaf, and again with a banana leaf. This is the typical meal of the Nochebuena Dinner (Christmas Eve), in the Caribbean Coast Region of Colombia since their humble beginnings. It is often confused with the tamal from the Andean region, which is made up with corn.\n\nPasteles were brought over to the Dominican Republic from Puerto Rico and known as Pasteles en hojas. Pasteles en hojas have very little change from when bought over from Puerto Rico, masa and filling is usually identical or similar.\n\nDominicans usually use three tubers plantains, malanga and squash are most popular. The tubers are grated into what is called masa. Masa is then placed on a banana leaf. The masa is then filled with meat. Different meats and seasoning from around the island can be used; ground pork seasoned with sofrito and ground annatto is the most common and traditional.\n\n\"Bollo de Guayiga\" is made of a tuber called Guayiga and is available in southern beaches as a snack, but to the region of San Cristobal and Najayo Beach.\n\nIn El Salvador pasteles are a red-tinted cornflour-based dish with a stuffing of either beef or chicken with chopped potatoes and carrots. The stuffing is cooked separately so that the flavors mix. Once the stuffing is cooked, it is put into the molded flour dough, which is made by adding the mixture of boiled water and achiote powder, thus giving the flour the red coloring. Once the stuffing is in the flour turnover it is fried to a finish. It is usually served with \"curtido\", a lightly fermented cabbage slaw.\n\nThe common name for this food in Hawaii, \"pateles\", is most likely borrowed from Caribbean Spanish, which features weakening or loss of /s/ at the end of syllables: the pronunciation of pasteles as \"pateles\" occurs in Puerto Rican dialects, for instance. Over 5000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii at the dawn of the 20th century to work in sugar plantations. The singular of pasteles, \"pastel\" (often pronounced \"patel\"), has been constructed through back-formation. The usage of the singular can be seen in phrases such as \"pastele stew\".\n\nIn Puerto Rico, pasteles are a cherished culinary recipe, especially around Christmas-time. The masa consists of typically grated green banana, green plantain, eddoe (\"yautía\"), potato, and tropical pumpkins known as calabazas. It is seasoned with liquid from the meat mixture, milk, and annatto oil. The meat is prepared as a stew and usually contains any combination of boston butt, ham, bacon, raisins, chickpeas, olives and capers, and is commonly seasoned with bay leaves, recaito, tomato sauce, adobo seco, and annatto oil, but the seasoning is not limited to these. Meat can be anything from poultry, fish, pork and game.\n\nAssembling a typical pastel involves a large sheet of parchment paper, a strip of banana leaf that has been heated over an open flame to make it supple, and a little annatto oil on the leaf. The masa is then placed on banana leaf and stuffed with the meat mixture. The paper is then folded and tied with kitchen string to form packets. Some people use aluminum foil instead of parchment and string.\n\nOnce made, pasteles can either be cooked in boiling water or frozen for later use. Because they are so labor-intensive, large Puerto Rican families often make anywhere from 50 to 200 or more at a time, especially around the holiday season. They are usually served with rice and pigeon peas (\"arroz con gandules\"), escabeche, roasted pork, and other holiday foods on the side.\n\n\"Pasteles de yuca\" is one of many recipes in Puerto Rico that are popular around the island and in Latin America. These are also known as \"hallacas de yuca\" or \"tamales\" in the Dominican Republic. The masa is mostly \"yuca\" (cassava) and may contain potato, malanga and yam. The grated yuca and potatoes are squeezed through a cheesecloth. Some liquid from the stew is added to the masa with annatto oil. The filling may be traditional or it may be a stew of currants, shrimp, crab or lobster, and seasoned with basil, sofrito, adobo, and annatto oil.\n\nAnother variety is \"pasteles de arroz\" where the \"masa\" is actually composed of partly cooked seasoned rice which is fully cooked as the \"pastel\" boils. Fillings are traditional, pork butt, chicken and crabmeat are the most common.\n\nPasteles of all varieties are commonly served with ketchup, tabasco-ketchup sauce or with pique criollo. Pique criollo is a hot sauce made from local hot chilies and other ingredients which are pickled in vinegar, sometimes with rum added.\n\n\"Cuchifrito\" pasteles are done traditionally. The masa consists of grated green banana \"(pasteles de guineo)\" or green plantains \"(pasteles de plátano)\", liquid from the meat mixture, milk, and annatto oil. It is then filled with Boston butt and served with a sauce. In this case \"cuchifrito\" refers to the establishment in which the pastel is sold; traditionally, cuchifritos are exclusively fried foods, though places selling them may also offer other types of foods.\n\nRelated to tamale, hallacas, and guanimes, pasteles are believed to have been made by natives of Boriquen(Puerto Rico). Tainos made masa from cassava and squash. The masa was then filled with beans, corn, nuts, meat (Iguana, frogs or birds), fish and wrapped in corn husk. The pastel has also African roots. The African slaves incorporated the use of plantains, bananas and other root vegetables into the pasteles recipe. Puerto Rico has turned pasteles making into an art having hundreds of recipes and an annual pastel festival (Festival Nacional del Pastel Puertorriqueño) on the island.\n\nTrinidadian pastelles are small meat-filled cornmeal pies stuffed with meat, fish or vegetables seasoned with fresh herbs and flavoured with raisins, olives and capers wrapped and steamed in a banana leaf. They are traditionally prepared and eaten during the Christmas season. It is believed that they were introduced by Spanish colonizers who ruled between the late 15th and early 18th centuries.\n\nThey exist in some form or another throughout Latin America and are more commonly known in Venezuela as hallacas, pronounced hayacas. The origins of pastelles are unclear. One view is that Spanish colonists who settled in the region made them as a substitute for one of their favourite delicacies – empanada gallega. Empanada gallega and pasteles both have heavily spiced meaty fillings but pastelles are made with cornmeal while the empanada is more like a typical pastry as it is made with white flour.\n\nA sweet version is called \"paime\" and is also a Christmas dish. It contains no filling, but the dough itself contains ground coconut and raisins.\n"}

In its modern processed form it may have originated in Limeira in the 19th century.\n\nIn the book \"Stories & Recipes\", Nadir Cavazin says that the son of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846-1921) and Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, a child who lived in seclusion for having mental problems had a favorite dish, chicken, but only ate the thigh. One day, not having enough thigh, the cook decided to turn a whole chicken into thighs, shredding it and making the filling for a flour dough shaped into a drumstick. The child endorsed the results. Empress Teresa Cristina, when she was visiting him, could not resist the tasty delicacy; she liked it so much she requested that the master of the imperial kitchen learn how to prepare the snack.\n\nThe coxinha is based on dough made with wheat flour and chicken broth and optionally mashed potato, which is filled with shredded spiced chicken meat, or a whole chicken thigh. The filling consists of chicken, and onions, parsley and scallions, and occasionally tomato sauce, turmeric and catupiry cheese. The coxinha is coated in thick batter, then in bread crumbs or manioc flour and deep fried. It is shaped to roughly resemble a chicken leg. The dough used to coat the filling is generally prepared with the broth of the chicken, enhancing the flavor of the coating.\n\nDifferent variations of the original are becoming more prevalent today – for example, the \"coxinha mineira\", for which the filling includes maize, so named because maize is deemed a culinary tradition in the state of Minas Gerais, as well as areas where the caipira and sertanejo dialects are spoken. Cheese coxinhas are also very common in snack bars. In Curitiba, chicken coxinhas filled with requeijão and cheddar can be found in local restaurants. To mark the cheese they usually have a toothpick where the bone would be in a chicken coxinha.\nOther unconventional ingredients, generally used for home-made \"coxinhas\" made by aficionados, include peas, chopped button mushrooms, palmheart, carrot, cooked and seasoned cashew apples, unripe jackfruit or unripe breadfruit, as well as whole-wheat flour batter or even a vegetarian version of either textured vegetable protein (soy meat) or falafel with appropriate seasonings so its taste resembles a traditional coxinha more closely. These variants are rarely found in snack bars.\n\n\"Coxinha\" literally means \"little thigh\", and it is how deep fried chicken legs are informally named in Brazil (\"coxa frita\" means a deep fried chicken leg, while \"sobrecoxa frita\" stands for a deep fried upper drumstick; It is not uncommon for people having a strong preference for certain poultry cuts over others). Battered and deep fried chicken breast pieces, for example, are generally called by a name of English influence, nugget.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6853208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6853208", "title": "Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation", "text": "Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation\n\nThe Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez is a chess opening that begins with the moves:\n\nBlack may recapture on c6 with either pawn; although 4...bxc6 is playable, 4...dxc6 is almost always chosen at master level. Black has gained the at the cost of a weakened pawn structure, due to his doubled pawns on c6 and c7. White aims to reach an endgame in which he has the superior pawn structure, which may become an important factor. Thus, Black is compelled to strive for an active position, generally avoiding piece exchanges. The variation was introduced into grandmaster play by Emanuel Lasker, and later invigorated with new ideas by Bobby Fischer.\n\nThe Exchange Variation can be a powerful psychological weapon. Black is forced to play actively, which is psychologically difficult if all one needs is a draw. Lasker's famous win against Jose Raul Capablanca in the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament is an example of this. With a lead in the tournament, Capablanca was intent on simplifying the game to obtain a draw, but faced with the Exchange Ruy he played too passively and was routed by Lasker as a result.\n4...dxc6 is the main recapture. Black's structure is weakened, but he has free diagonals for his bishops. White cannot win a pawn with 5.Nxe5 as 5...Qd4 forks White's knight and pawn, thus regaining the material, leading to positions where White has forfeited his structural advantage—the compensation for ceding the . \n\nAfter 4...dxc6, the most popular move for White is 5.0-0. This is sometimes called the Barendregt Variation, a name proposed by Robert Byrne in a 1966 article for \"Chess Life\", after the Dutch master Johan Barendregt who played it in the early 1960s. Barendregt made considerable contributions to the theory, although the variation is much older than this. White now threatens 6.Nxe5 because the sequence 6...Qd4 7.Nf3 Qxe4 to regain the pawn, now fails to 8.Re1 pinning and winning the queen. \"ECO\" code C68 examines these responses to 5.0-0: 5...Qf6, 5...Qe7, 5...Bd6, 5...Qd6, or 5...Bg4 (all directly defending the e5-pawn, except 5...Bg4 which indirectly defends by pinning the knight). The moves 5...Be6, 5...Be7, and 5...Ne7 are less common moves which have never achieved popularity. The idea behind these moves is that if White plays to win a pawn with 6.Nxe5, 6...Qd4 7.Nf3 Qxe4 is again playable, as the Black minor piece on e6 or e7 blocks the e-file.\n\nAfter Black defends his e5-pawn, White's main idea is to play d2–d4, opening lines and freeing his pieces. Because the pawn-only endgame favours White, he is usually happy if this move leads to mass exchanges on the d-file.\n\nA move that was popular amongst masters during Bobby Fischer's reign and is still popular today is 5...f6. White's most active and modern approach to this defense is 6.d4, after which Black has two options: 6...Bg4 and 6...exd4. The move 6...Bg4 can be met also by two options: 7.dxe5 and 7.c3. On 7.dxe5 Qxd1 8.Rxd1 fxe5, White cannot take the e5-pawn with the knight because the knight is pinned by the bishop. Multiple trades have occurred, however, bringing the position closer to an endgame, which is beneficial for White since he has the better pawn structure.\n\nThe second move against 5...f6 6.d4 is 6...exd4. White should play 7.Qxd4 (Fischer chose the more obscure 7.Nxd4 in two Exchange Variation games in his 1992 match with Boris Spassky), offering a trade of queens that Black should take or else he is clearly worse. After 7...Qxd4 8.Nxd4 c5 9.Nb3 (9.Ne2 is another line; however, Fischer often preferred 9.Nb3) and White will develop freely by developing his bishop to e3, his b1-knight to c3 or d2 depending on the position, and bringing one of his rooks to d1, usually the rook on f1.\n\nThe most aggressive reply to 5.0-0 is 5...Bg4. After 6.h3, Black has possibilities such as 6...Bh5 or 6...Bxf3, but the most modern and active variation is 6...h5. White cannot take the bishop with 7.hxg4 because Black plays 7...hxg4, attacking the knight. If the knight moves, 8...Qh4 threatens checkmate with 9...Qh2# or 9...Qh1#. After 8...Qh4, if White tries 9.f3, trying to escape via f2 after a queen check, Black replies 9...g3 with inevitable mate.\n\nAfter 6...h5, the most common continuation is 7.d3 Qf6 8.Nbd2 Ne7 9.Re1 Ng6. Now a typical mistake is: 10.hxg4. After 10...hxg4, 11.g3 offering back the piece (White should not try to hold onto the knight, as it would be similar to the position after 7.hxg4 hxg4). After 11.g3 gxf3?! 12.Qxf3, White is safe and has the superior pawn structure, which is considered to offer a small advantage in the ensuing queenless middlegame. However, after 11.g3 Black can play 11...Bc5!, and after 12.Nb3 comes 12...gxf3 13.Nxc5 Rh3 , while after 12.Kg2 0-0-0 13.Qe2 also comes 13...Rh3!.\n\nAn interesting alternative to 9.Re1 is 9.Nc4. If Black continues as usual with 9...Ng6?, then White can capture the bishop with 10.hxg4 hxg4 11.Bg5! +−. Therefore Black usually captures on f3 with 9...Bxf3 10.Qxf3 Qxf3 11.gxf3. The resulting queenless middlegame scores slightly better for White. This line was played by Igor Glek three times, scoring 2½ out of 3.\n\nThis is often called the Bronstein Variation. White's popular choices are 6.Na3 and 6.d3. After 6.d4 exd4 7.Nxd4, this move permits 7...Bd7 followed by ...0-0-0. Other ways for White to proceed include 6.a4 or 6.c3. This line is a favorite of Oleg Romanishin, who employed it successfully on multiple occasions.\n\nThe other main reply to 5.0-0 is 5...Bd6. White again goes 6.d4, where Black can play either 6...exd4 or 6...Bg4.\n\nThe move 6...exd4 is not the best move. White recaptures the pawn with 7.Qxd4 and stands clearly better. An example of a massacre where Black is on the losing side is as follows: 7...f6 8.Nc3 Bg4 9.e5! attacking the g4-bishop with the queen and the d6-bishop with the pawn. After 9...Bxf3 10.exd6, Black cannot capture the pawn because the f3-bishop is , and after 10...Bh5 11.Re1+ Kf8 12.Qc5, attacking the bishop on h5 while threatening dxc7 discovered check, winning the queen, White has a winning advantage.\n\nThe move 6...Bg4 is the better move in this line. White has a couple of possible moves, but the best line is 7.dxe5 Bxf3 8.Qxf3 Bxe5. Numerous trades have occurred, so White is satisfied. After 9.Nd2 Ne7 10.Nc4 Ng6 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Qg3 (Salazar–Smith, Groningen 1976/77), White had the upper hand (Gipslis).\n\n5.d4 was used by Lasker in his famous win over Capablanca, but is less popular today than 5.0-0. The main line is considered to be 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 Qxd4 7.Nxd4 Bd7 (rather than Capablanca's 7...Bd6) 8.Be3 0-0-0 with an approximately equal position.\n\nWhite has also tried 5.Nc3, 5.b3, 5.d3, and 5.c3.\n\nIf White can exchange all pieces, he has a big advantage in the endgame due to the pawn structure. Max Euwe gave the pure pawn ending (without pieces—see diagram) resulting after the exchange of White's d-pawn for Black's e-pawn as a win for White. The winning procedure is detailed in \"Secrets of Pawn Endings\". In essence, the winning plan is to create a passed pawn on the kingside, while Black is unable to do the same on the because of the doubled pawns. The passed pawn ties down the black king and allows White to transfer his king to the queenside at an opportune moment, forcing a pawn through to promotion.\nThis recapture is much less popular than 4...dxc6. Black gains the half-open b-file, but his central pawn structure becomes awkward. His c8-bishop has a particularly hard time finding a square, since moving the d-pawn leaves the c6-pawn undefended. If 5.Nxe5, Black regains the pawn with 5...Qg5 6.Nf3 Qxg2 7.Rg1 Qh3; White has lost the right to castle but has a lead in development. Fischer wrote that White has an enduring initiative after 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 Qf6 7.Qd3.\n\nThere are two \"ECO\" classifications for the Exchange Variation. \n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The first noted or applauded example of this was the sweet-fermented Imperial \"Kaiser-Semmel\" roll of the Vienna bakery at the \"Paris International Exposition of 1867\". These sweet-fermented rolls lacked the acid sourness typical of lactobacillus, and were said to be popular and in high demand.\n\nPrior to this time, bakers had been using old-dough leavens, and they had discovered that accelerating the latter refreshments' rest intervals promoted yeast growth in a race against time and what would later be learned were overwhelming lactobacillus numbers. At some point bakers began to add brewer's or beer yeast or barm to the latter refreshments, and liked the results.\n\nA shortage of beer yeast for making sweet-fermented breads developed when beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting to bottom-fermenting yeast (both S. cerevisiae), so the Vienna Process was developed by 1846. In 1845 the Association of Vienna Bakers announced a contest for the production of a sweet-fermenting yeast; this prize was awarded in 1850 to . In 1867 the Paris Exposition was said to recognize the Vienna Bakery as, \"First in the world.\"\n\nThe Vienna bakery of the exposition year made three kinds of bread: the sweet-fermented Imperial rolls; wheat and rye as well as rye-only loaves; and a large variety of fancy breads and sweet cakes. The Imperial rolls were made with the finer grades of flour, milk and water in a 50:50 ratio, beer yeast, and salt. Other breads made with the same grades of flour claimed to include: Teacakes, which added butter and may have excluded water in favor of milk; Gipfel or Pinnacle cake, which used milk (no water) and lard; and Brioche, made with milk and sugar.\n\nVienna yeast was propagated utilizing a mash of malted corn, barley, and rye. Horsford did not assert hops were used in the production of press yeast. After pitching a small amount of yeast into the cooled wort, and introducing some air, the propagated yeast floated to the surface. This yeast was collected with some care by skimming. Cool, distilled water was used to wash and settle the yeast a sufficient number of times until only the yeast remained. It was then drained and compressed with the aid of a hydraulic press.\n\nPress-yeast was one forerunner to the modern, commercially available baker's yeast.\n\nHungarian high milling used a hard or tenacious variety of Hungarian wheat. Their mills were outfitted with both stone and steel-roller mills, and were using a new process that was undoubtedly at the forefront of the technology of the day. This time period marked a changeover from one-pass stone grinding or \"low milling\" with its higher damaged starch content, to that of roller milling with greater speed, efficiency, and cooler-temperature operation.\nEben Norton Horsford wrote, Horsford observed that high-milled flour contained less damaged starch, \n\nThe origins of high milling appeared to be Austria. Horsford attributed the phrase \"high milling\" to Vienna grits or , and which were claimed to be on sale in Berlin as early as 1810. The recognized pioneer was a miller named Ignaz Paur (1778–1842) who by 1810 had moved to Leobersdorf. The demand for these grits was so great, hand sifting them was inadequate, so Paur employed the services of a cabinet maker named Winter to build the first middlings purifier. Paur milled already-separated grits a second time, first making an \"extract flour\" locally known as \"Auszug\". Over the course of several decades, these high-milling techniques spread to Hungary, Saxony, and Bohemia, among other areas. In Hungary, the steel cylinder or roller mill, locally known as the \"Walzenmühle\", was first invented, and later improved. The Walz sets kept the grain cooler over multiple passes, as successive pairs of rollers were adjusted to incrementally smaller spacings, the grain moved through cooling air from one pair to the next, each cracked them pass-by-pass into smaller successive bits, instead of crushed between stones in one heat-generating pass.\n\nAt the Pesth Walzenmühle, when wheat had been fully transformed to flour, it had passed through 18 to 24 pairs of rollers. This new \"cold milling\" process, particularly well suited for hard wheat, likely resulted in lighter, more airy breads of greater baked volumes.\n\nThe Vienna bread-production process innovations are often credited for baking with steam leading to different crust characteristics. In 1837, August Zang, a native of Austria, opened a Bakery in Paris called the \"Boulangerie Viennoise\" which first introduced steam baking to France, and whose process was described in detail in an entry on Viennese Bread in an 1849 French Industrial Chemistry book: \"the crust of these breads glazes while baking in an atmosphere of steam, to which effect, one places on the floor of the oven a pile of wet hay, well washed in advance, which produces a cloud of steam.\" Decades later, another Viennese bakery in Paris introduced the mechanical steam oven, eliminating the need for wet hay, along with cereal press yeast; the United States Government report on the 1867 Universal Exposition details the process used in the \"Viennese bakery of Mr. Vanner\", including his use of a steam oven, which by then had become quite popular in France: \n\nIn the steam oven technique, dough is placed into the oven under a ceiling of steam or, alternatively, the oven is injected with steam as soon as the loaf is loaded. This adds moisture to the body of the bread which delays establishment of the crust and tends to prevent cracking, resulting in a more evenly risen and thinner crust as well as a light and airy crumb. When the steam is turned off, the dry heat of the oven bakes the crust, producing its characteristically slightly crisp and flaky texture. Vienna bread is typically formed as an oblong loaf, but can be baked in other shapes. As a longer loaf, it may well have been the origin of French bread as bakers there attempted to adopt the steam method to produce their baguettes.\n\nSome reports in the decades to follow point out that not all Viennese bread is produced in a steam oven. For instance, Horsford, in his 1875 Report on Vienna Bread, wrote:\n\n"}

Unlike ice cream or sorbet, which are whipped while freezing to prevent ice crystal formation, an ice pop is frozen while at rest and becomes a solid block of ice. The stick is used as a handle to hold it. Without a stick, the frozen product is known as something else (e.g. a freezie).\n\nIce pops can also be referred to as a popsicle (Canada, U.S., New Zealand), freezer pop (U.S.), ice lolly, ice pop (United Kingdom, India, Ireland, South Africa), ice block (New Zealand, parts of Australia), icy pole (parts of Australia) or ice drop in the Philippines.\n\n\"As far back as 1872, two men, doing business as Ross and Robbins, sold a frozen-fruit confection on a stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey.\"\n\nFrancis William \"Frank\" Epperson (11 August 1894, Willows, California – 22 October 1983, Fremont, California) of Oakland or San Francisco, California, (it is debated where) popularized ice pops after patenting the concept of \"frozen ice on a stick\" in 1923. \n\nEpperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905, at the age of 11, when he accidentally left a glass of powdered lemonade soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story still printed on the back of Popsicle treat boxes.\n\nEpperson lived in Oakland and worked as a lemonade salesman.\n\nIn 1922, Epperson, a realtor with Realty Syndicate Company in Oakland, introduced the Popsicle at a fireman's ball. It was a sensation, at the age of 29, Epperson applied for a patent in 1923 for a \"frozen ice on a stick\" called the Epsicle ice pop, and by 1924, he had patented \"a handled, frozen confection or ice lollipop.\" He initially called it the Epsicle. Epperson debuted, and began selling Epsicles, in seven fruit flavors at Neptune Beach amusement park, described as a \"frozen lollipop,\" or a \"drink on a stick.\"\n\nA couple of years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City.\n\nIn the United States and Canada frozen ice on a stick is generically referred to as a \"popsicle\" due to the early popularity of the Popsicle brand, and the word has become a genericized trademark to mean any ice pop or freezer pop, regardless of brand or format. (The word is a portmanteau of \"pop\" and \"icicle\"; the word is genericized to such an extent that there are decades-old derived slang meanings such as \"popsicle stand\".) They are also called an \"ice pop\" or \"freezer pop\" in the United States. In the Caicos Islands it is referred to as an \"ice saver\". In the United Kingdom and Ireland the terms \"ice lolly\" and \"ice pop\" are used, though \"ice pop\" is much more common in Ireland. \"Chihiro\" is used as a slang term in the Cayman Islands, partially derived from \"chill\". Different parts of Australia use either \"ice block\" or \"icy pole\", and New Zealand uses \"ice block\".\n\nAfter a trip to the United States in the early 1940s Ignacio Alcázar returned to his home city of Tocumbo, Michoacán, México bringing the idea to manufacture ice pops or \"paletas\" (little sticks) using locally available fresh fruit. He and some family members expanded by opening a shop in Mexico City which became very popular and he began to franchise \"Paletería La Michoacana\" to friends and family from his town. The popularity of Paletas and association with Tocumbo has increased to the status of a national Mexican food.\n\nPaleta flavors can be divided into two basic categories: milk based or water based. The composition of each flavor may vary, but the base is most often fruit. Paleterias usually have dozens of flavors of paleta including local flavors like horchata, tamarind, mamey and nanche along with other flavors like strawberry, lime, chocolate and mango. Distinctly Mexican ingredients like chili pepper, chamoy, and vanilla are often present in these paletas. Paleterias adapt their flavors to the tastes of the community and local availability of ingredients. \n\nA \"paletero\" (roughly equivalent to the English \"ice cream man\"), is a street seller of paletas and other frozen treats, usually from a pushcart labeled with the name of the enterprise that made the paletas (paletería). \n\nToday, many paleteros are now commonly found in American cities with significant Mexican populations. Vending requirements for paleteros vary widely by city. In San Jose, California, a permit to sell paletas costs about $154. On average, a paletero makes 40-60 cents from each paleta.\n\nAn alternative to the store-bought ice pops is making them at home using fruit juice, drinks, or any freezable beverage. A classic method involves using ice cube trays and toothpicks, although various ice pop freezer molds are also available.\n\nOn June 22, 2005, Snapple tried to beat the existing \"Guinness World Records\" entry of a 1997 Dutch ice pop by attempting to erect a ice pop in New York City. The of frozen juice that had been brought from Edison, New Jersey in a freezer truck melted faster than expected, dashing hopes of a new record. Spectators fled to higher ground as firefighters hosed away the melted juice.\n\n\n\n"}

Polmos Łańcut controls about ten percent of the Polish market. A small amount of the distillery's output is exported to Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and the United States.\n\nThe distillery in Łańcut was founded by Duchess Lubomirska on the vast estate of the Lubomirski family. An original document attesting to the distillery's existence in 1784 can be found in its museum. Primarily the Łańcut estate produced regular, anise flavoured and sweetened vodkas.\n\nCount Alfred Wojciech Potocki, a grandson and heir of the Duchess, started to run the Łańcut and Lwów Lubomirski estates in 1823. He modernised the management of these properties, and implemented the Schwartz distillation equipment. The production of premium vodkas, liqueurs, creams and ratafias was started, in addition to regular and anise flavoured vodkas. The estate ran two company outlets in Lwów and Vienna. In 1882 Alfred Józef Potocki created a network of agents to promote sales in Galicia and Austria–Hungary. Trains of the Viennese rail lines passing through the town of Łańcut used to make longer stops to allow travellers to buy the distilleries' famous products. In 1900, \"Count Alfred Potocki's Distillery\" won a gold medal at the International Exposition in Paris for his array of products. Between 1911–1912 Roman Potocki moved the plant to a newly equipped building. Some of the buildings were destroyed with the eruption of World War I. The difficulties were helped by establishing a stock company in 1917.\n\nIn 1924 the State alcohol monopoly was funded in Warsaw. Łańcut distillery managed to hold its position among the best companies in the country thanks to investments in equipment and innovations. The plant survived the outbreak of World War II largely intact, but it suffered major destruction in 1944 from the withdrawing German armies and advancing Russian units. In 1951 a state enterprise called \"Łańcut Spirits Industries\" was created out of the \"Łańcut Spirits Stock Company\" and \"Count Alfred Potocki's Privileged Distillery of Liqueurs, Rosoglios and Rum in Łańcut\". In 1969 the plant was producing fifteen kinds of unflavoured and flavoured vodkas, about 200,000 bottles a day.\n\nIn 1991 Polmos, the Polish Alcohol Monopoly was dissolved. The distillery became an autonomous state company. The previous product line was maintained: about sixty brands, including Wyborowa, Luksusowa, Extra Żytnia, Krakus, Polonaise, Jarzębiak, Soplica, Pieprzówka, Żubrówka, Wiśniówka and Ratafia and also Polish Cherry and Cacao Choix liqueurs. Soon more than a dozen of own products was added to the brand assortment. Among others Łańcut vodka was introduced and the flag product of the old Potocki firm, Rosoglios, was reintroduced.\n\nThe Łańcut distillery holds a museum portraying the plant's traditions and the history of the Polish vodka industry. The museum is located in a manor built in 1883, designed by Ludwik Boguchwalski, which once was the headquarters of the estate management. Its exposition contains old distilling devices, antique machinery as well as old documents, labels, bottles and tasting glasses.\n\n\nŁańcut is a pure vodka produced by Polmos Łańcut form high quality grain spirit rectified and filtered many times. According to its producer it has a mild and delicate taste and aroma which is obtained by the use of time-tested ingredients and careful processing. It contains 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nIn 1995 it was granted a gold medal by International Fair POLAGRA in Poznań. It was also awarded with a silver medal and ranked 87 \"Highly Recommended\" points by the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Valari is used for protecting cattle from predators, war and hunting. It was the favorite weapon of choice in a deer hunt. Tamil Nadu is strongly associated with this weapon. It is the predecessor of the wooden boomerang, which was used widely in India since the Upper Paleolithic, most notably in the Ganga Plains for hunting birds and small, mobile prey.\n\nLike the hunting boomerang of the aboriginal Australians, the Tamilian valari were two types: returning and non-returning to the thrower. Valari is made in many shapes and sizes. History of Valari is rooted to ancient times and evidences can be found in Tamil Sangam literature \"Purananuru\". The usual form consists of two limbs set at an angle; one is thin and tapering while the other is rounded and is used as a handle. Valari is usually made of iron which is melted and poured into molds, although some may have wooden limbs tipped with iron. Alternatively, the limbs may have lethally sharpened edges; special daggers are known as kattari, double-edged and razor sharp, may be attached to some valari.\n\nThe thrower holds the valari by one of its limbs and throws it. There are several ways of throwing and aiming. It is usually given a spin while throwing. While flying through the air, it can maneuver and execute several types of movements according to the throwers purpose. It may spin in the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or just fly without spinning. The spin may also vary in speed. A lethal throw is given a spin and aimed at the neck. A non-lethal throw is given a spin and aimed at the ankles or knees. This is to capture a fleeing victim. A simple hurting blow does not have any spin. It is sharp enough to cut through a person's neck during war .\n"}

Generally, it is served with sugar or honey and crushed nuts, usually almonds or walnuts. Some varieties are made as an herbal infusion only, without the green tea leaves.\n\nTraditionally, kahwah is prepared in a copper kettle known as a samovar. A samovar consists of a \"fire-container\" running as a central cavity, in which live coals are placed keeping the tea perpetually hot. Around the fire-container there is a space for water to boil and the tealeaves and other ingredients are mixed with the water. Kahwah may also be made in normal pans and vessels, as modern day urban living may not always permit the use of elaborate samovars.\n\nKahwah is usually served to guests or as part of a celebration dinner, and saffron (\"kong\") is added to the kahwah for special visitors. It is often served in tiny, shallow cups. Kehwa in Kashmir is also commonly served after Wazwan and elaborate family dinners. \n\nSometimes milk is added to the kahwah, but this is generally given to the elderly or the sick.\n\nKahwah is usually served after food (usually lunch) in the North Malabar region of India.\n"}

Often chiura is paired with tea as a mid-morning snack in the fields.\n\nChiura holds an important place in the traditional Nepali wedding ceremony. Chiura is usually included in the brideprice, any valuables or wealth given to the bride’s family by the groom. After the initial wedding ceremony, the families escort the bride back to the groom’s house. During this procession, the pounded rice ceremony occurs. The bride and groom are seated next to one another, and the bride is given the chiura. The groom then formally asks the bride to give him the chiura. He will ask this two more times, each time using a form of “you” that indicates a lowering of her social status. This ceremony reiterates the fact that the woman’s social ranking has dropped far below its original status.\n\n\nIt is usually consumed during the daytime with lentil or other vegetables with soup.

The cookie generally originated in the United States, its development dating back to the 1910s. If crunchy peanut butter is used, the resulting cookie may contain peanut fragments.\n\nGeorge Washington Carver (1864-1943), an American agricultural extension educator, from Alabama's Tuskegee Institute, was the most well known promoter of the peanut as a replacement for the cotton crop, which had been heavily damaged by the boll weevil. He compiled 105 peanut recipes from various cookbooks, agricultural bulletins and other sources. In his 1925 research bulletin called \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it for Human Consumption\", he included three recipes for peanut cookies calling for crushed or chopped peanuts.\n\nIt was not until the early 1920s that peanut butter was listed as an ingredient in the cookies.\n\nEarly peanut butter cookies were either rolled thin and cut into shapes, or else they were dropped and made into balls; they did not have fork marks. The first reference to the famous criss-cross marks created with fork tines was published in the \"Schenectady Gazette\" on July 1, 1932. The \"Peanut Butter Cookies\" recipe said: \"[s]hape into balls and after placing them on the cookie sheet, press each one down with a fork, first one way and then the other, so they look like squares on waffles.\"\n\nPillsbury, one of the large flour producers, popularized the use of a fork in the 1930s. The \"Peanut Butter Balls\" recipe in the 1933 edition of \"Pillsbury's Balanced Recipes\" instructed the cook to press the cookies using fork tines. These early recipes do not explain why the advice is given to use a fork, though. The reason is that peanut butter cookie dough is dense, and unpressed, each cookie will not cook evenly. Using a fork to press the dough is a convenience of tool; bakers can also use a cookie shovel (spatula).\n\n\n"}

In the Cambodian town of Skuon (Cheung Prey, Kampong Cham Province), the vending of fried spiders as a specialty snack is a popular attraction for tourists passing through this town. Spiders are also available elsewhere in Cambodia — in Phnom Penh for instance — but Skuon, a market town on the highway from the capital, is the centre of their popularity. The spiders are bred in holes in the ground in villages north of Skuon, or foraged for in nearby forestland, and fried in oil. It is not clear how this practice started, but some have suggested that the population might have started eating spiders out of desperation during the years of Khmer Rouge rule, when food was in short supply. \n\nThe spiders are a species of tarantula called \"a-ping\" in Khmer, and are about the size of a human palm. The snacks cost about 300 riel each in 2002, or about US$ 0.08. One travel book identifies them as \"Haplopelma albostriatum\", also known as the Thai zebra tarantula, and notes that the same species' common name has been the \"edible spider\" for more than a hundred years. The popularity of the dish is, however, a recent phenomenon, starting perhaps as late as the 1990s. The same book details a recipe: the spiders are tossed in a mixture of MSG, sugar, and salt; crushed garlic is fried in oil until fragrant, then the spiders are added and fried alongside the garlic until \"the legs are almost completely stiff, by which time the contents of the abdomen are not so runny.\" \n\nThe taste has been described as bland, \"rather like a cross between chicken and cod\", with a contrast in texture from a crispy exterior to a soft centre. The legs contain little flesh, while the head and body have \"a delicate white meat inside\". There are certainly those who might not enjoy the abdomen, however, as it contains a brown paste consisting of organs, possibly eggs, and excrement. Some call it a delicacy while others recommend not eating it.\n\nIn Mexico, tarantulas have been offered in tacos, with a splash of guacamole . However, Mexican authorities stopped this restaurant from selling them, because they are a protected species. \n\n"}

These are further divided into 50 groups based on their physiological actions and diseases they cure. Flowering plants are divided into \"sukadhanya\" (cereals), \"samidhanya\" (pulses), \"saka varga\" (pot herbs), \"phala varga\" (fruits), \"harita varga\" (vegetable), \"ahayogi varga\" (oils), and \"iksu varga\" (sugarcane).\n\nThe Vaisesikas school of philosophy classify plants under seven heads, e.g. \"Vrksa\", \"Trna\", \"Osadhi\", \"Gulma\", Lata, \"Avatana\" and \"Vanaspati\".

The game is played using a standard 52 card deck. Aces can be counted as either a one or eleven depending on which value would best benefit the player's hand. All the face cards in the deck each count as ten. The remaining cards are taken at face value. The player must first place a bet and is then dealt two cards face up. The dealer is dealt two cards as well, but one is face up and one face down. The player then has the option to either \"hit\", (request another card) or \"stand\" (decline additional cards). The player's hand must beat the dealer's by coming closer to 21 without \"busting\" (exceeding 21). A winning hand with a total of 21 is called a blackjack, or natural.\n\nThe game differs from traditional blackjack because the player automatically wins if his hand has six cards or more with a total of 20. This rule applies even if the dealer has a total of 21 (blackjack). Other advantages to Super Fun 21 include being able to split a hand up to four times, a player's blackjack supersedes a dealer's blackjack, a player may \"double down\" at any point no matter how many cards he has been dealt, and the player automatically doubles their money with a hand consisting of five cards or more that total 21.\n\nThe other major difference between Super Fun 21 and traditional blackjack is that a blackjack only pays 6 to 5 instead of the traditional 3 to 2 payout. This more than makes up for the edge the casino is giving with the liberal rules variations above.\n\nSuper Fun 21 was protected by U.S. Patent number 5,979,897 issued in 1999 to Howard F.

The salad can be as simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several pastas tossed together with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. Additional types of pasta may be used, such as ditalini. These can include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood. Broccoli, carrots, baby corn, cucumbers, olives, onions, beans, chick peas, peppers, and parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars.\n\nOften, it is recommended to rinse the pasta after cooking, but before dressing and serving. The reason for this is to prevent the pasta from becoming gummy and sticking together. An alternative is to add oil (like olive oil) to the pasta, either after it is done cooking or to add it to the pasta water. The noodles can be spread out to cool and will not stick together because of the layer of oil on their surfaces.\n\nIn Australian and New Zealand cuisine, pasta salad became increasingly popular during the 1990s when commercial versions became more readily available in supermarket stores across both Australia, and New Zealand. It is made up of cooked pasta pieces (usually either shell pasta, elbow shaped pasta or Penne) covered in mayonnaise and accompanied by carrots, capsicum (bell peppers), and sometimes celery. It is similar in style to the American macaroni salad.\n\n\n"}

The literal meaning of the word is \"commune\" or \"community\". It is the smallest administrative unit that is governed by elected representatives. Cities are also municipalities. The council is called \"obecní zastupitelstvo/obecné zastupiteľstvo\" or \"zastupitelstvo města/mestské zastupiteľstvo\" or \"zastupitelstvo městyse\", the office is called \"obecní úřad/obecný úrad\" or \"úřad města/mestský úrad\" or \"úřad městyse\". An obec can have its own flag and coat of arms and is composed of one or more cadastral areas (\"katastrální území/katastrálne územia\"). An obec can have several settlements or parts whether villages or hamlets.\n\nThere are 2891 obcí in Slovakia as of 2008.\n\nAfter meeting certain conditions such as population over 5000, being well accessible, having cultural or economical significance and having an urban style of settlement an obec can be declared a town (\"mesto\").\n\nThe number of municipalities () in the Czech Republic is 6250 (in 2010).\n\nWhole area of the republic including mountains, forests and national parks is divided into municipalities (excepting military grounds - see Unincorporated Areas of the Czech Republic). Smallest municipalities are shaped only by one small village, some by two or more villages or by the city and several villages. Mostly a municipality has the same name as the settlement where is the municipal office, but there are many exceptions: some municipalities have double name (Sedlec-Prčice, Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav), some municipalities have a name which have no its settlement (Orlické Podhůří) and some municipalities have the office in other part than in the \"nominal\".\n\nThe smallest Czech municipalities are Závist (0,42 km) and Karlova Studánka (0,46 km). The lowest number of the population has Vysoká Lhota (17 inhabitants by ČSÚ, 2013) and Čilá (18 inhabitants), many small municipalities have populations only of tens. Typical rural municipality has hundreds of inhabitants.\n\nThe biggest are Prague (496,09 km, 1,3 mil. inh.), Brno (230,19 km, 405 thous.), Ostrava (214,22 km, 313 thous.) and by extent is the fourth Ralsko (170,23 km, including a former military area, only 2 thousands inhabitants).\n\nEvery city () or town () is an \"\"obec\"\" (some separately, some along with attached villages). Not even the biggest cities are divided into more municipalities, but several biggest cities (\"statute cities\") can have self-governing subdivisions, so-called city parts (\"městská část\") or city circuits (\"městský obvod\") which have standing partly similar to small municipalities.\n\nSome of municipalities have only basic status of municipality, some have extended competencies of delegated state administration (\"pověřená obec\", \"obec s rozšířenou působností\") for the territory of the municipality and for surrounding (smaller) municipalities.\n\n\"Město\" (a city) and \"městys\" (a town) is currently above all ceremonious honorary degree. Some municipalities have such title for historic reasons, though they are small. Smallest cities are Přebuz (population of 69 inhabitants) and Loučná pod Klínovcem (87 inhabitants). The law makes it possible to restitute by request a status of city or town for every municipality which lost it (during communist period). But a municipality which want to acquire status of city (\"město\") firstly, must have population over 3000 and the improvement in status is subject of assessment by chairman of the parliament. For \"městys\" (towns) definite population are not a condition. The biggest of cities are \"statute cities\" and can have self-governing subdivisions. A special type of municipality is the capital Prague, which has simultaneously a status of municipality and a status of region and which is treated by special law.\n\n\n\n"}

As such, in the eyes of Smyrniots boyoz acquired the dimension of a symbol of their hometown or of their longing for it when away. The most widely preferred boyoz is plain, without addition of meat or cheese or spinach stuffings, and as cooked by a handful of master boyoz bakers in İzmir.\n\nBoyoz paste is a mixture of flour, sunflower oil and a small addition of tahini. It is kneaded by hand and the ball of paste is left to repose for 2- hours. The paste is then flattened to the width of a dish and left to repose again. It is then kneaded and opened once more, before being formed into a roll and left to repose as such for a further period of several hours. When the tissue of the paste is still soft but about to detach into pieces, it is cut into small balls and put in rows of small pans and marinated in vegetable oil between half an hour and one hour. The paste then takes an oval form and acquires the consistency of a millefeuille. The small balls can then be put on a tray into a very high-temperature oven either in plain form or with fillings of cheese or spinach added inside.\n\nThe usual accompaniments for boyoz are dark tea and hard-boiled eggs generously sprinkled with black pepper. Boyoz is generally consumed outdoors, purchased from street vendors.\n\nVirtually all sources agree on the Judeo-Spanish roots of boyoz (Bollos). It is a contribution to İzmir's urban culture by Sephardic Jews evicted from Spain after 1492 and who settled in large numbers in a number of prominent Ottoman cities of the period, among which İzmir stood out as one of the primary destinations. These explanations on the roots of boyoz are confirmed by the presence of a pastry very similar to boyoz in the culinary traditions of such other offshoots of Spanish culture as Argentina, Chile, Peru and Mexico, where they are common especially in the diet of Sephardic Jews, usually with cheese and spinach fillings. In Spanish and Ladino languages, boyoz, spelled as \"bollos\", means \"a bundle, a pack\".\n\nFinally, until recently, all master bakers who prepared boyoz in İzmir were Jewish, and the present masters have all been trained by Avram Usta, whose name is echoed to this day in the commercial arguments adopted by some of these bakers, who market the \"Boyoz of Avram Usta\".\n\n\n"}

When towed at speed, by a powerful boat or some other device, the board of the hydrofoil 'flies' above the water surface and generally avoids contact with it, so the ride is largely unaffected by the wake or chop of the water and is relatively smooth. The air board is a modified hydrofoil where the skier stands up.\n\nHydrofoils date back the early 1900s, however they were not part of a recreational sport. While the first hydrofoil boat was created in 1906 by Italian inventor Enrico Forlanini, the first waterski hydrofoil was invented in the early 1960s by Walter Woodward, an aeronautical engineer, with two skis attached to a bi-wing hydrofoil. In 1972, Mike Murphy and Bob Holst added a bi-wing hydrofoil to a surfing kneeboard, then reduced the bi-wing to a single wing. Murphy and Bob Woolley then applied the concept to sit-down hydrofoil, with Woolley riding the first \"Sit Ski\" in 1984. After various material changes, including the addition of a seat belt to keep rider and ride together and prevent separation collisions, they sold their first \"Air Chair\" in 1990. Advancements in materials and hydrofoil design have created stronger rigs, gentler rides (shock absorbers in the seat), more maneuverability, and boards that combine sit-down and stand-up (air board) for surfing.\n\n\n\nUnlike water skiing or wakeboarding, a hydrofoiler's body and the board rise above the water, supported by a pair of front and rear hydrofoil wings which are still under the water. This reduces the drag of the water, allowing for both a smoother ride on rough water and a lesser need for strength.\n\nThe rider sits on the seat of the hydrofoil and is strapped in with a seat belt; their feet are strapped into bindings near the front of the board. When the rider is ready the boat will start to tow the skier. The water flowing past the hydrofoil wings generates lift, which can be controlled by the rider to move the board up and down or side to side above the surface of the water. The rider must be centered over the post of the hydrofoil; small body movements will cause great reactions with the hydrofoil. In order to \"float\" upward the rider leans back while maintaining balance to avoid pitching forward unexpectedly. To go back down the rider leans forward or pushes down with the feet. Turning is accomplished by pointing the knees in the direction desired; the hydrofoil will follow. To jump, the rider leans even farther back. This will give the rider a somewhat stable base to perform aerial tricks for example.\n\nSubmerged hazards such as trees can be struck by the hydrofoil as low as 3 feet below the surface of the water, causing the rider to fall without warning. Such a fall can be the same as colliding with an object, with the rider impacting the water or the foil. The tow rope can get tangled around the skier or equipment, creating a hazardous condition. After a fall the skier remains strapped to the board; while it will turn upright quickly, there is always the possibility of drowning.\n\n\n"}

Hot chocolate had become a popular drink in seventeenth-century Europe, alongside coffee and tea, and all three beverages were used to make frozen and unfrozen desserts. Latini produced two recipes for ices based on the drink, both of which contained only chocolate and sugar. In 1775, Italian doctor Filippo Baldini wrote a treatise entitled \"De sorbetti\", in which he recommended chocolate ice cream as a remedy for various medical conditions, including gout and scurvy.\n\nChocolate ice cream became popular in the United States in the late nineteenth century. The first advertisement of ice cream in America started in New York on May 12, 1777 when Philip Lenzi announced that ice cream was officially available \"almost every day\". Until 1800, ice cream was a rare and exotic dessert enjoyed mostly by the elite. Around 1800 insulated houses were invented and manufacturing ice cream soon became an industry in America.\n\nChocolate ice cream is generally made by blending cocoa powder along with the eggs, cream, vanilla and sugar used to make vanilla ice cream. Sometimes chocolate liquor is used in addition to cocoa powder, or it is used exclusively, to create the chocolate flavor. Cocoa powder gives chocolate ice cream its brown color, and it is uncommon to add other colorings.\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius, which provides an international set of standards for food, states that the flavor in chocolate ice cream must come from nonfat cocoa solids that must comprise at least 2.0-2.5% of the mix weight. The US Code of Federal Regulations \"permits reductions in the content of milk fat and total milk solids by a factor of 2.5 times the weight of the cocoa solids\", in order to take into account the use of additional sweeteners.\n\nThe minimum fat content of chocolate ice cream in both Canada and the United States is 8%, irrespective of the amount of chocolate sweetener in the recipe.\n\nChocolate ice cream is sold in many places, including restaurants, cafés, diners, supermarkets, and grocery and convenience stores. Ice cream parlors specialize in the sale of ice cream. Chocolate is one of the five most popular ice cream flavors in the United States and second only to vanilla.\n\nChocolate ice cream is used in the creation of other flavors, such as rocky road. Other flavors of ice cream contain chocolate chips mixed in with the ice cream. For example, (plain) chocolate chip ice cream is made with vanilla ice cream, chocolate chocolate chip (or double chocolate chip) ice cream is made with chocolate ice cream, and mint chocolate chip ice cream is made with mint ice cream.\n\n\n\n"}

In Indian culture, it is considered one of the first solid foods that babies eat. Hindus, who avoid eating grains during fasting, eat Sabudana Khichadi made from sago. \"Kichri\" is a salty porridge. \"Dalia\" is another similar sweet porridge made from the crushed wheat or barley mixed with sugar and milk. It was the inspiration for the Anglo-Indian dish \"kedgeree\".\n\nThe term \"khichdi \"() (Urdu: کھچڑی) is derived from Sanskrit खिच्चा \"khiccā\", a dish of rice and legumes.\n\nSome divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word \"khicṛī\". The sound is the retroflex flap , which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ड़, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter ڑ.\n\nThe Greek ambassador Seleucus mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent. The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta mentions \"kishri\" as a dish in India composed of rice and mung beans, during his stay around 1350. \"Khichdi\" is described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It was very popular with the Mughals, especially Jahangir. \"Ain-i-Akbari\", a 16th-century document, written by Mughal Emperor Akbar's vizier, Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, mentions the recipe for\" khichdi\", which gives seven variations. There is an anecdotal story featuring Akbar, Birbal and khichdi.\n\nKhichdi is a very popular dish across the Indian subcontinent, including in Nepal and Pakistan also. The dish is widely prepared in many Indian states, such as Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Maharashtra. Vegetables such as cauliflower, potato, and green peas are commonly added. A popular variant in coastal Maharashtra is made with prawns. \"Khichdi\" is also a favourite comfort food, owing to the convenience of being able to cook the dish in a single simmering pot.\n\nIn other regions, \"khichdi\" is commonly served with a side of \"kadhi\", and often accompanied with \"papadum\".\n\nThere are many variations in the Khichdi. Multigrain Khichdi is also a healthy variation and it includes ingredients such as rice, tuvar dal, green chana, onion, green chillies, green sprouts, sunflower seeds, flax seeds. The nutrious and tasty khichdi garnish with coriander and serve with pickle and buttermilk. \n\nIn Bengal, the dish is known as , \"khichuri\", \"kisuri\", and is considered a rich gourmet delicacy. Often seasoned with \"ghee\" (clarified butter) and \"achaar\" (oil-based pickle), it is accompanied with meat curries, fish, potato chops, eggplants, and omelettes. The rice is commonly cooked and served on rainy days. It is a staple for holy ceremonies and as an offering to gods.\n\nCooks and homemakers often prepare this dish with many ingredients mixed with it. That is one of the reasons the idiom \"joga khichuri\" (জগা খিচুড়ী) is used in Bangla to mean \"a mess\".\n\nA stickier version of the rice, similar to \"haleem\", is traditionally served to children and sick people. It is the first solid to which babies are introduced. Rice and lentils are simmered till mushy, seasoned with turmeric and salt, and fed to infants to introduce them to \"adult\" food. The elderly and sick, especially those having stomach problems, are served with the rice as it is easily digestible compared to other dishes which involve more meat and spices.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims in the city of Sylhet in Bangladesh, and Sylheti diaspora in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States break their fast with \"kisur\"i, and it is a notable delicacy to eat during the holy month by the Sylheti people.\n\n\"Khichdi\" is also very popular in Bihar. It is made with rice, \"dal\", and \"garam masala\", cooked into a semipaste like consistency and eaten with \"ghee\", \"baigan ka bharta\", \"aaloo ka bharta\" (mashed potato with onions, green chilli, salt, and mustard oil), tomato chutney (blanched tomato, onion, green chilli, grated ginger and mustard oil), \"pāpaṛ\", \"tilori\" (a fried snack), and mango pickle. It is customarily eaten every Saturday in Bihar, and also at dinner during Makar Sankranti. A popular variation in \"khichdi\" in winter is the addition of cauliflower and green peas.\n\n\"Khichdi\" is a very popular dish of Gujarat. It is served with special \"kadhi\" and \"addon\" dishes such as \"Surati undhia\" and \"ringan na ravaiya\".\n\nKhichdi is also served in various flavor such as \"Sadi Khichdi\", \"Masala Khichdi\", \"Swaminarayan Khichdi\" etc.\n\nIn particular, it is a staple food (and daily diet) for most of the agrarian communities such as Patels.\n\nIn Bharuch district, Gujarat, \"khichdi\" is rice cooked with turmeric to make it yellow, served mixed with \"kadhi\", a thin sauce made from gram flour, curry leaves, cumin, and mustard seeds, and eaten as an evening meal.\n\n\"Khichari\" is the traditional diet and a daily meal of Kutchi people, and they make several varieties of dishes using\" khichari\". \"Khichdi\", when well cooked with a little oil, is considered a light and nutritious dish, and is especially popular amongst many who follow an ayurvedic diet or natural cure.\n\n\"Kichad\"i is a popular traditional staple in Haryana, specially in the rural areas. \"Haryanvi kichri\" is made from pearl millet and mung \"dal\" (split mung bean) pounded in mortar (\"unkhal\"), and often eaten by mixing with warm \"ghee\" or \"lassi\", or even yogurt. Sometimes, \"jowar\" is also mixed with \"bajra \"and\" mung \"dal\".\" Kichri\" is salty and \"dalia\" is another similar sweet porridge made from the crushed wheat or barley mixed with sugar and milk.\n\n\"Khechidi \"is very popular in Odisha. The varieties of khechidi in Odisha include \"adahengu khechidi\" (ginger-asafoetida \"khichdi\"), \"moong dal khichdi\", etc. \"Adahengu khechidi\" is a popular dish in the Jagannath Temple, as well. At home, \"moong dal khechidi\" and other \"khechidis\" are served with \"pampad\", pickle, curd, \"aaloo bharta\", or \"baigan bharta\", \"raita, dalma,\" and chutney.\n\n\"Bisi bele bath\", hot lentil rice, is a famous variant of \"khichdi\" from Karnataka, a state in southern India. \"Pongal\", a dish similar to \"khichdi\", is popular in southern India, primarily in Tamil Nadu. It is primarily made of rice and lentils, and seasoned with black pepper, cumin, and cashews.\n\nThe Hyderabadi Muslim community, of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in present-day Telangana, Marathwada, and Hyderabad-Karnataka regions, make \"khichdi\" as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of Hyderabadi cuisine. The dish is called \"khichdi, kheema, khatta\", or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal,\"kKhichdi\", ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame. The dish is commonly eaten with an omelet, as well.\n\nIn Pakistan, \"khichri\" () is prepared with rice and pulses or lentils and has salt as condiment. It could also have \"baghaar\", where fried onion is added to it.\" Khichri\" is popular food for babies between 4 and 6 months when they start eating solid food, since it is soft and has no spices. People with an upset stomach also prefer \"khichri\" since it has no spices.\n\n\"Khichri \"is a common and easy-to-prepare meal enjoyed in the Indian and also extending to growing numbers of Fijian communities. It is prepared by frying rice, lentils, masala, salt, onions, garlic, and often cubes of potatoes and \"ghee\", and then adding water to boil it until cooked. It is consumed on its own or sometimes with pickles and chutney. The term\" khichri\" is referred to in a figure of speech common in the Indian communities \"\"birbal ke khicri kab pakegi\"\" (translated as \"how long will it take to cook the khichri?'). This a reference to a folk tale where Birbal in a battle of wits with King Akbar, was challenged to cook \"khichri\" in a pot which was placed 20 m above the flame, so as to illustrate the amount of time it would take for someone to \"complete a task\".\n\n\"Khichra\" is similar to \"haleem\", a meat dish, while\" khichdi \"is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils, with no spices.\n\nRecently, the Indian media unofficially designated it as the \"national dish\", and it is being globally promoted by the government of India as \"queen of all foods\". India's Minister of Food Processing Industries Mrs. Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, \"\"Khichdi\" is considered nutritious, healthiest food in India, and it is eaten by poor and rich alike, irrespective of their class. It symbolises India's great culture of unity in diversity. So it has been selected as the brand of Indian food.\" Under the wider plan to popularize and promote Indian cuisines internationally and to provide opportunities for both investment and trade in the food-processing sector for leading Indian and international companies, the government plans includes popularisation of the brand \"India\" khichdi\"\" and recipe in restaurant and kitchens throughout the world by Indian Foreign Missions. The recipe includes rice, mung beans, amaranth, \"jowar, bajra\", barley, and Indian spices.\n\nThe report that the government may designate \"khichadi\" as India's \"national dish\" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah wrote, “Do we have to stand every time we see it being eaten? Is it compulsory to eat before a movie? Is it antinational to not like the stuff?,”\nThe Union Minister of Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal clarified that there was never such a plan.\n\n\"Khichdi\" has lent its name to media synonymous with ensembles or potpourri as depicted in the popular culture through movies such as \"\", and TV sitcoms such as \"Khichdi (franchise), Khichdi (TV series)\", and \"Instant Khichdi\".\n\n"}

At that time, it was 36 feet (11 meters) in diameter and was known as the 36-foot Telescope. In 1984, it was renovated with a new backup structure and a slightly larger dish. At this point its name was changed to the 12 Meter Telescope.\n\nIn 2000, the NRAO passed control of the telescope to the University of Arizona. The University of Arizona had been operating the Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) located on Mount Graham since 1992. When it took over operations of the 12m, it created the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) which now runs both telescopes.\n\nIn 2013, the entire antenna (dish and mounting) was replaced with ESA's ALMA prototype antenna, which had been located in New Mexico. The new antenna is the same size (12 meters) but has a much better surface accuracy (thereby permitting use at shorter wavelengths), and a more precise mount with better pointing accuracy.\n\nThis table displays some of the characteristics of the telescope and the site.\n\nIn the almost 40 years since it was first built, the 12m Radio Telescope has been at the forefront of millimeter molecular astronomy: studying molecules in space through the use of molecular spectroscopy at millimeter wavelengths. Many of the molecules that have been discovered in the interstellar medium were discovered by the 12m.\n\n"}

A typical patch cut might be 2-3 tree lengths. Below a certain size, seedling regeneration advantage shifts from the shade intolerant species favored in clearcuts to the shade tolerant species favored by selection harvests.\n\nAn areas of patch cuts of different shapes were tried in the Northern hemisphere to see where shade tolerant and shade intolerant species might regenerate. It was found in small patches (1/10 acre) N. 44° that there was a limited solar exposure of only a few hours (3-4) and this would lead to strongly shade tolerant and moderately shade tolerant trees dominating over time. Yet at slightly larger (1/2 acre) patches much more sunlight for longer was reaching the forest floor. This would warm the floor more, increase nutrient release and thus more light demanding species could grow faster and might then reach maturity in the stand.\n\nAs well as light other factors to be considered are wind to avoid windthrow, pathogens and fire risk. Positive benefits can also be gained if patches keep horizontal biodiversity in a forest stand and for an owner with not so much forest this may be useful for keeping non-timber forest products in usable amounts.\n\nPatch cuts can have less visual impact than clearcuts, and can mimic some stand disturbance processes. Patch cuts can also be simpler to implement than trying to selectively log individual trees within a selection cut.\n\nPatch cuts are distinct from the group selection method. A patch would pick several trees to be big enough to allow regeneration of a specific species, perhaps that has problems growing due to shade intolerance or another factor, as several together. Whereas a group would be only a few mature trees (3-5) and would not necessarily favor a shade intolerant species to establish into a group. In a patch the edge effect would be overcome but in a group most likely not.\n\nPatch cuts may be used in a hybrid system with the single tree selection cut method or the group tree selection cut method.\n\n\n"}

It was also a favorite drink of author John Steinbeck.\n\nThe Jack Rose is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\".\n\nReferences to the Jack Rose date back to the early 20th century. A 1905 article in the National Police Gazette mentions the drink and credits a New Jersey bartender named Frank J. May as its creator. A 1913 news article mentions that sales of the drink had suffered due to the involvement of Bald Jack Rose in the Rosenthal murder case.\n\nThere are various theories as to the origin of the drink's name. One has the drink being named after (or even invented by) the infamous gambler Bald Jack Rose. Albert Stevens Crockett states that it is named after the pink \"Jacquemot\" (also known as Jacqueminot or Jacque) rose. It has been suggested that the Jack Rose was invented by Joseph P. Rose, a Newark, New Jersey restaurateur who once held the title of \"World's Champion Mixologist.\" Harvey's Famous Restaurant in Washington, D.C. also claimed to be the originator of the cocktail. The most likely explanation of the name is that it is a simple portmanteau — it is made with apple\"jack\" and is \"rose\" colored from the grenadine. \n\nThe cocktail has fallen out of fashion. In June 2003, the \"Washington Post\" published an article that chronicled two writers' quest to find a Jack Rose in a Washington, D.C. bar.

In Cornwall, fairings contained ginger and became famous around the country when a Cornish manufacturer started selling them by mail order in 1886. The same manufacturer still makes them and the company has recently teamed up with Rick Stein to make biscuits.\n\nCornish fairings are sweet and spicy ginger biscuits, made with standard biscuit ingredients such as flour, caster sugar and butter, together with mixed spice, ginger, cinnamon and golden syrup. They are roughly circular and brittle similar to gingerbread. They are created by mixing the dry ingredients with butter, until the mixture resembles bread crumbs, then adding the sugar and syrup before forming the biscuits and baking high in the oven, followed by a period at the bottom of the oven.\n\n\"Fairings\" was originally the common name for edible souvenirs sold at fairs around England. Although at Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, fairings of gingerbread were sold from 1126 to 1800, fairings would vary throughout the country — in the northern counties a traditional fairing would be decorated \"paste eggs\" at Easter. The Cornish version included the spiced ginger biscuit which became famous in Victorian times. The complete fairing from Cornwall would include the ginger biscuit, along with almond and caraway comfits (colloquially \"lambs' tails\" - actually sugar-coated almonds and caraway seeds), crystallised angelica and macaroons.\n\nDuring the 1800s, the biscuits became a treat that young men from the middle or lower classes would buy as a treat for their sweetheart. Previously, the spices required to create the biscuits were exclusive to the wealthy classes, who used them to make cakes. A number of manufacturers started making ginger biscuits called \"fairings\" all over England. One example of this was in Grasmere, where the gingerbread sold as fairings was so popular that William Wordsworth's sister Dorothy wrote in one of her journals that she and her brother both craved them. In 1875, John Cooper Furniss obtained a large store in East Bridge Street, Truro, and premises on Duchy Wharf and installed ovens for biscuit manufacturing. He introduced several new kinds of biscuits and also a penny box of sweetmeats with every box containing a small piece of jewellery. Needless to say, these were very successful and in great demand. In 1886, John Cooper Furniss started selling the ginger biscuits at his tea room in Truro, Cornwall, baking them in his Truro bakery. They were so popular that he started selling them via mail-order. The recipe Furniss used is thought to have originated from a \"maid-hiring\" fair which used to take place during the week after Christmas, in Launceston, Cornwall although Furniss Foods suggest the recipe came from the fairs held at Whitsuntide or Corpus Christi.\n\nFurniss went on to expand his company to Furniss Foods, a well-known Cornish biscuit manufacturer, which created a number of different fairing varieties, such as \"orange and lemon\" or \"apple and cinnamon\". He also established a Charitable Trust which is still in operation today. It is limited to the parish of Truro to provide assistance to residents in need who use coal as the primary source of heat. The company moved to a larger factory in 1988, but ran into financial difficulties during the 2000s and it was bought by Proper Cornish, a pasty manufacturer, which focused the company's production on the Cornish fairings and a couple of other lines.\n\nCornish foods are an essential element in the county's touristic appeal, with a survey by South West tourism showing food as one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall. During an interview where he was launching a new line of biscuits, celebrity chef Rick Stein explained that he associated fairings with his childhood.\n"}

There were various clauses associated with this process:\n\n\nIn niyoga, the bodies were to be covered with ghee (so that lust may not take root in the minds of the participants but the actual act may take place for conception).\n\nThe epic \"Mahabharata\" describes one instance of niyoga. Queen Satyavati compels her son, sage Vyasa to perform niyoga with both the widows of her son Vichitravirya. The widows, Ambika and Ambalika and one of their maids, bear Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, respectively.\n\nIn the Manusmṛti, niyoga is described in IX.59-63, but the practice is also forbidden in IX.64-68.

It can also be made from other milks, but that is less common.\n\nThe term may come from the Italian phrases \"capa mozza\" or \"testa mozzata\", both meaning \"severed head\". This would also explain the use of \"scamorza\" in Italian to mean \"fool\" or \"idiot\".\n\nScamorza is a stretched-curd cheese, in which the fresh curd matures in its own whey for several hours to allow acidity to develop by the process of lactose being converted to lactic acid. Artisanal cheese makers generally form the cheese into a round shape, and then tie a string around the mass one third of the distance from the top, and hang to dry. The resulting shape is pear-like. This is sometimes referred to as \"strangling\" the cheese. The cheese is usually white in color unless smoked. When smoked, the color is almond with a lighter interior.\n\nScamorza can be substituted for mozzarella in most dishes, but the resulting taste will be much stronger and more dominant. It is reputed to melt better in baking. Using the smoked variety (scamorza affumicata) adds a nice background flavor in replacement of mozzarella.\n\nIn Italy, scamorza is more commonly made in the south rather than the north. Strictly speaking, scamorza is a product of Apulia and Calabria. However, it is available across the country, both in the unsmoked and smoked forms. Mario Batali cites grilled scamorza as a traditional dish in Neapolitan cooking. Scamorza in Bari is made from sheep's milk.

Its pungent flavour gave rise to the proverb “Only love is stronger than Brös”. It has been conjectured that its name derives from Bresse in the Dauphiné.\n\nThe antiquity of this speciality is unknown, although it was probably well-established before the beginning of the nineteenth century when Vittorio di Sant’Albino described it in his Piedmontese-Italian dictionary. The original motivation was the avoidance of waste: pieces of stale, hard and/or mouldy cheese were mixed with homemade grappa (the distillate of the pomace remaining from winemaking) plus, perhaps, butter and spices, and left to ferment in an earthenware container until the mixture acquired a creamy texture. At this point it was covered and could be treated as a preserve.\n\nBrös has acquired a certain cachet in recent years, and may often be found in the restaurants of the Langhe. However the robust traditional formulation has been largely replaced by one based on fresh cheeses such as Robiola and white wine.\n\nBrus da ricotta is a version without wine or grappa which is made in various parts of Piedmont by fermenting sheep’s milk ricotta cheese for a month or more, and aromatizing with chilli or black pepper. It has been recognized as a “traditional Piedmontese product” by the regional government.\n\nBruzzu is similar non-alcoholic product based this time on ewes’ milk ricotta and produced in the communes of Triora, Molini di Triora and Cosio di Arroscia in the Province of Imperia, western Liguria. The cheese is referred to by the government enquiry into agriculture chaired by Stefano Jacini in 1877–1882 and remained very popular until the 1990s. In the first decade of the twenty-first century it enjoyed something of a revival and was included in the Ark of Taste catalogue of heritage foods. The ricotta is placed in moulds to drain and then transferred to wooden vats to ferment, usually with the addition of salt. The cheeses are ready to eat after being aged for about a week in the cellar. They come in various sizes, are creamy in texture, and are ivory or brownish-white in colour.\n\n"}

Sankofa is often associated with the proverb, “\"Se wo were fi na wosankofa a yenkyi\",\" which translates as: \"It is not wrong to go back for that which you have forgotten.\"\n\nIn addition to being used on adinkra cloth in Ghana, the Sankofa heart is a common design on gates in the United States, particularly New York City. In Brooklyn, the Sankofa heart is commonly upside down on gates to Brownstone residential buildings.\n\nThe sankofa bird appears frequently in traditional Akan art, and has also been adopted as an important symbol in an African-American and African Diaspora context to represent the need to reflect on the past to build a successful future. It is one of the most widely dispersed adinkra symbols, appearing in modern jewelry, tattoos, and clothing.\n\nThe Akan people of Ghana use an Adinkra symbol to represent this same idea and one version of it is similar to the eastern symbol of a heart, and another version is that of a bird with its head turned backwards taking an egg off its back. It symbolizes taking from the past what is good and bringing it into the present in order to make positive progress through the benevolent use of knowledge. Adinkra symbols are used by the Akan people to express proverbs and other philosophical ideas.\n\nThe sankofa bird also appears on carved wooden Akan stools, in Akan goldweights, on some ruler's state umbrella or parasol (\"ntuatire\") finials and on the staff finials of some court linguists. It functions to foster mutual respect and unity in tradition.\n\nDuring a building excavation in Lower Manhattan in 1991, a cemetery for free and enslaved Africans was discovered. Over 400 remains were identified, but one coffin in particular stood out. Nailed into its wooden lid were iron tacks, 51 of which formed an enigmatic, heart-shaped design that could be a sankofa symbol. The site is now a national monument, known as the African Burial Ground National Monument, administered by the National Park Service. A copy of the design found on the coffin lid is prominently carved onto a large black granite memorial at the center of the site.\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture uses the heart-shaped symbol on its website. The \"mouse over\" for the image reads: \"The Sankofa represents the importance of learning from the past.\"\n\nSankofa symbols show themselves all over cities like Washington, DC and New Orleans, particularly in fence designs.\n\nJanet Jackson has a sankofa tattoo on her inner right wrist. The symbol is also featured in her 1997 album \"The Velvet Rope\", as well as on the supporting tour.\n\nSankofa is an event used by Saint Louis University to honor African-American student graduates and students who graduate with degrees in African American studies.\n\nThe symbol and name were used in the 1993 film \"Sankofa\" by Haile Gerima, as well as in the graphic title of the film\" 500 Years Later\" by Owen 'Alik Shahadah.\n\nA UK stage production by Adzido Pan-African Dance Ensemble, scripted by Margaret Busby and premiered in 1999, was entitled \"Sankofa\".\n\nThe African-American string band Sankofa Strings, founded in 2005 by Sule Greg C.

Yet according to Bert Fragner:\n\nIt is a matter of mere speculation whether the origins of this imperial culinary legacy are to be traced back to Greek antiquity, the Byzantine heritage, or the Turkish and Arab nations, not forgetting Phoenician traditions; nowadays you may find support for any of these claims in various countries in the Balkans and the Near East.\n\nNear Eastern specialist Maxime Rodinson notes as a rule of thumb that:\n\n[D]espite everything, Latin Europe on the one side and Islam and the Byzantine Empire on the other were heirs of the civilizations of antiquity. Muslim culture, after all, developed from a base of eastern Hellenism. Thus, when we see a general similarity between dishes served in both East and West we need to show that they do not have a common, parallel origin in Graeco-Roman cooking before we adduce any oriental influence.\n\nNeedless to say, determining the antiquity of a dish, which ones were widespread due to their presence in Hellenistic, Roman or Eastern Roman (Byzantine) times, and which became widespread later, within the roughly coextensive Ottoman empire, can be difficult. The food historian, Iranologist and Ottomanologist Bert Fragner emphasizes the importance of New World foodstuffs in particular in defining sui generis Ottoman cuisine, as it adopted them more rapidly than France, Italy, and northern Europe.\n\nAs with the earlier Byzantine cuisine, the center of Ottoman cuisine was in Istanbul, the capital, where the imperial courts and the metropolitan elites had established a refined culinary tradition bringing together elements of regional cuisines from across the empires:\n\n...despite the disintegration of the Ottoman political empire, we can still see the survival of a large region which could be called the Ottoman culinary empire. The Balkans, Greece, Anatolia and the Fertile Crescent... are common heirs to what was once the Ottoman life-style, and their cuisines offer treacherous circumstantial evidence of this fact. Of course, they represent at the same time a good deal of local or regional culinary traditions. Besides, one should not forget that it is typical of any great cuisine in the world to be based on local varieties and on mutual exchange and enrichment among them, but at the same time to be homogenized and harmonized by a metropolitan tradition of refined taste.\nThis diverse cuisine was amalgamated and honed in the Imperial Palace's kitchens by chefs brought from certain parts of the empire to create and experiment with different ingredients. These chefs were tested and hired by their method of cooking rice, a simple dish. They were brought over from various places for the express purpose of experimenting with exotic textures and ingredients and inventing new dishes.\n\nEach cook specialized in specific tasks. All dishes intended for the sultan were first passed by the palate of the Chesnidjibashi, or imperial food taster, who tested the food for both poison and taste. The creations of the Ottoman palace's kitchens also filtered to the common population, for instance through Ramadan events, and through the cooking at the yalis of the pashas, and from there on to the people at large.\n\nSome of the more extravagant dishes remained as palace specialities and have had only limited diffusion:\n\nThe traditions of Ottoman cuisine continue in Albanian cuisine, Algerian cuisine, Bosnian cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Serbian cuisine, Bulgarian cuisine, Greek cuisine, Azerbaijani cuisine, Iranian cuisine, Armenian cuisine, Georgian cuisine, Ukrainian cuisine, Cypriot cuisine, Sephardi cuisine, Romanian cuisine and Middle Eastern cuisine\n\n\n\n"}

Varieties of khinkali spread from there across different parts of the Caucasus. The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe, the so-called \"khevsuruli\", consisted of only minced meat (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, chili pepper, salt, and cumin. However, the modern recipe used mostly especially in Georgian urban areas, the so-called \"kalakuri\", uses herbs like parsley and cilantro (also called coriander). In Muslim-majority areas the use of beef and lamb is more prevalent. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.\n\nKhinkali is eaten plain or with ground black pepper. The meat filling is uncooked when khinkali is assembled, so when it is cooked, the juices of the meat are trapped inside the dumpling. To make khinkali juicier usually warm water or broth is added to the minced meat. Khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices while taking the first bite, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting. The top, where the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten, but discarded to the plate so that those eating can count how many they have consumed. In Georgia, this top is called the \"kudi\" (Georgian: ქუდი, \"hat\") or \"k'uch'i\" (Georgian: კუჭი, \"stomach\").\n\nThere is a widespread etiquette in Georgia to use only one's bare hands while consuming these dumplings; the using of utensils, like a fork, is considered impolite.\n\nThe towns of Dusheti, Pasanauri and Mtskheta are particularly famous for their khinkali.\n\n\n"}

He also said that when mixed with tonic, which he referred to as a \"Trump & Tonic\" (T&T), it would become the most drunk cocktail in the United States. In 2007, Drinks Americas signed a deal to export 50,000 cases of Trump Vodka annually to Russia.\n\nThe Trump Vodka brand was discontinued in the United States in 2011 due to sales failing to meet the company threshold requirements. Several reasons were attributed for this. Drinks Americas also had problems producing it because the glass used in the bottles and the gold leaf labels were expensive and the company could not afford to produce them in large numbers. In 2015, during his campaign for President, Trump did not include Trump Vodka amongst assets submitted to the Federal Election Committee.\n\nDrinks Americas was subject to several lawsuits surrounding Trump Vodka.

However, Trump later dropped the lawsuit and signed a deal with H. Pixel International to allow them to sell Trump Vodka in Israel. Despite the failures in the United States, Trump Vodka found a level of popularity in Israel. This was because it was a popular choice around Passover for Orthodox Jews, as the vodka was made from potatoes and not grain, thus satisfying kosher for Passover dietary laws.

These spaces were not actually utilized until later on, when artists realized they could make designs and paint in these small areas, enhancing the overall design of the building.\n\nStephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin brought the term into biology in their 1979 paper \"\". This defined the biological concept and argued the case for a structuralist view of evolution.\n\nThe term was coined by Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould and population geneticist Richard Lewontin in their paper \"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme\" (1979). Evolutionary biologist Günter P. Wagner called the paper \"the most influential structuralist manifesto\".\n\nIn their paper, Gould and Lewontin employed the analogy of spandrels in Renaissance architecture: curved areas of masonry between arches supporting a dome that arise as a consequence of decisions about the shape of the arches and the base of the dome, rather than being designed for the artistic purposes for which they were often employed. The authors singled out properties like the necessary number of four spandrels and their specific three-dimensional shape. At the time, it was thought in the scientific community that everything an animal has developed that has a positive effect on that animal's fitness was due to natural selection or some adaptation. Gould and Lewontin proposed an alternative hypothesis: that due to adaptation and natural selection, byproducts are also formed. These byproducts of adaptations that had no real relative advantage to survival, they termed spandrels. In the biological sense, a \"spandrel\" might result from an architectural requirement inherent in the \"Bauplan\" of an organism, or from some other constraint on adaptive evolution.\n\nEvolutionary biology uses the term spandrel for features of an organism arising as byproducts, rather than adaptations, that have no clear benefit for the organism's fitness and survival. In response to the position that spandrels are just small, unimportant byproducts, Gould and Lewontin argue that \"we must not recognize that small means unimportant. Spandrels can be as prominent as primary adaptations\". A main example used by Gould and Lewontin is the human brain. Many secondary processes and actions come in addition to the main functions of the human brain. These secondary processes and thoughts can eventually turn into an adaptation or provide a fitness advantage to humans. Just because something is a secondary trait or byproduct of an adaptation does not mean it has no use.\n\nIn 1982, Gould and Vrba introduced the term \"exaptation\" for characteristics that enhance fitness in their present role but were not built for that role by natural selection. Exaptations may be divided into two subcategories: pre-adaptations and spandrels. Spandrels are characteristics that did not originate by the direct action of natural selection and that were later co-opted for a current use. Gould saw the term to be optimally suited for evolutionary biology for \"the concept of a nonadaptive architectural by-product of definite and necessary form – a structure of particular size and shape that then becomes available for later and secondary utility\".\n\nGould and Lewontin's proposal generated a large literature of critique, which Gould characterised as being grounded in two ways. First, a terminological claim was offered that the \"spandrels\" of Basilica di San Marco were not spandrels at all, but rather were pendentives. Gould responded, \"The term spandrel may be extended from its particular architectural use for two-dimensional byproducts to the generality of 'spaces left over', a definition that properly includes the San Marco pendentives.\"\n\nOther critics, such as Daniel Dennett, further claimed (in \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" and elsewhere) that these pendentives are not merely architectural by-products as Gould and Lewontin supposed. Dennett argues that alternatives to pendentives, such as corbels or squinches, would have served equally well from an architectural standpoint, but pendentives were deliberately selected due to their aesthetic value. Critics such as H. Allen Orr argued that Lewontin and Gould's oversight in this regard illustrates their underestimation of the pervasiveness of adaptations found in nature.\n\nIan Kluge criticizes the whole subject of spandrels to be bogged down in a definitional debate. He argues it is not entirely clear what is and is not a spandrel. He also argues all examples of spandrels, pendentives, corbels and squinches do actually serve a function; they are necessary to achieve something, but that necessity is exactly what epiphenomenalism denies.\n\nGould responded that critics ignore that \"later\" selective value is a separate issue from \"origination\" as necessary consequences of structure; he summarised his use of the term 'spandrel' in 1997: \"Evolutionary biology needs such an explicit term for features arising as byproducts, rather than adaptations, whatever their subsequent exaptive utility... Causes of historical origin must always be separated from current utilities; their conflation has seriously hampered the evolutionary analysis of form in the history of life.\" Gould cites the masculinized genitalia of female hyenas and the brooding chamber of some snails as examples of evolutionary spandrels.\n\nGould (1991) outlines some considerations for grounds for assigning or denying a structure the status of spandrel, pointing first to the fact that a structure originating as a spandrel through primary exaptation may have been further crafted for its current utility by a suite of secondary adaptations, thus the grounds of how well crafted a structure is for a function cannot be used as grounds for assigning or denying spandrel status. The nature of the current utility of a structure also does not provide a basis for assigning or denying spandrel status, nor does he see the origin of a structure as having any relationship to the extent or vitality of a later co-opted role, but places importance on the later evolutionary meaning of a structure. This seems to imply that the design and secondary utilization of spandrels may feed back into the evolutionary process and thus determine major features of the entire structure. The grounds Gould does accept to have validity in assigning or denying a structure the status of spandrel are historical order and comparative anatomy. Historical order involves the use of historical evidence to determine which feature arose as a primary adaptation and which one appeared subsequently as a co-opted by-product. In the absence of historical evidence, inferences are drawn about the evolution of a structure through comparative anatomy. Evidence is obtained by comparing current examples of the structure in a cladistic context and by subsequently trying to determine a historical order from the distribution yielded by tabulation.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky has argued that the \"language faculty\", and the property of discrete infinity or recursion that plays a central role in his theory of universal grammar (UG), may have evolved as a spandrel. In this view, Chomsky initially pointed to language being a result of increased brain size and increasing complexity, though he provides no definitive answers as to what factors led to the brain attaining the size and complexity of which discrete infinity is a consequence. Steven Pinker and Ray Jackendoff say Chomsky's case is \"unconvincing\" and that \"language maps \"among\" recursive systems rather than being a straightforward externalization of a single recursive system\", and as an example, numerical recursion \"is parasitic on language (rather than vice versa)\" among other arguments. Pinker contends that the language faculty is not a spandrel, but rather a result of natural selection. Newmeyer (1998) instead views the lack of symmetry, irregularity and idiosyncrasy that universal grammar tolerates and the widely different principles of organization of its various sub-components and consequent wide variety of linking rules relating them as evidence that such design features do not qualify as an exaptation. He suggests that universal grammar cannot be derivative and autonomous at the same time, and that Chomsky wants language to be an epiphenomenon and an \"organ\" simultaneously, where an organ is defined as a product of a dedicated genetic blueprint. Rudolph Botha counters that Chomsky has offered his conception of the feature of recursion but not a theory of the evolution of the language faculty as a whole.\n\nPinker has described music as a spandrel to the enlarged brain. Dunbar found this conclusion odd, and stated that \"it falls foul of what we might refer to as the Spandrel Fallacy: 'I haven't really had time to determine empirically whether or not something has a function, so I'll conclude that it can't possibly have one. Dunbar states that there are two potential roles of music in evolution: \"One is its role in mating and mate choice, the other is its role in social bonding.\"\n\nAccording to terror management theory, the human survival instinct conflicts with the knowledge of our mortality, which arose explicitly with human intelligence. This led to the creation of human culture to counter death anxiety: to activities and beliefs that make humans feel that they are individuals of value in a world of durable or even eternal meaning. Legacy and afterlife beliefs are said to provide a counter to death anxiety. Adherence to cultural values of some type generates self-esteem, which pushes death anxiety into the unconscious. The resurfacing of this anxiety has been studied with mortality salience and death thought accesibility studies.\n\n\n"}

It is washed and pounded thoroughly for maybe a couple of hours, generally in fresh water outside of the river and then set into cubes. A boiled, flavoured liquid including water, green and black olives and tamarind is then poured over it. Each cube is flattened on a plastic sheet and then placed on a flat reed mat. There, sesame seeds, and optionally dried sliced garlic, tomato and onion slices are sprinkled over it. The reed mats are then placed outside on a wood framed network to dry/cook in the sun for at least 7 hours. The finished product resembles a large sheet of \"Japanese nori\". The Kaipen sheets are packed into plastic bags for resale. \n\n\"Kaipen\" is rich in vitamins and minerals and tastes similar to \"nori\" but is slightly more sweet, bitter, and aromatic. \"Kai\" can be eaten by itself or used to flavour other foods. Flash-frying is the preferred method of preparation. An omega rich or olive oil produces the healthiest and best tasting Kaipen. After which it can be eaten like a potato chip. Eating fried \"kaipen\" while drinking a cold Beerlao would be optimal. \n\nA small number of people in Laos eat \"kaipen\" without cooking, although the safety of doing so could be questioned as it is a raw food and it does not taste anything like as good as quickly fried Kaipen, which is delightfully crispy. In 2002, some markets in the United States began to sell \"kaipen\".\n\nThe algae is sometimes identified as \"Cladophora\" sp. or \"Dichotomosiphon tuberosus\".\n"}

Both are observed by parties of friends or co-workers or sponsored by a company for their employees. \"Bōnenkai\" and \"shinnenkai\" are not part of the New Year \"Shogatsu\" celebration which lasts until the 3rd of January; they are instead a way of ending and beginning the year through a group celebration. At a \"shinnenkai\" however, some of the \"Shogatsu\" festivities can carry over to the New Year’s party like the making of \"mochitsuki\" by pounding sweet steamed rice or \"kagamiwari\" which is the breaking open of \"sake\" barrels with a wooden hammer and drinking together.\nThis tradition started in the 15th century during the Muromachi period as gatherings to express one's thanks for each other. At that time, the party was known as \"nōkai\" (great achievement gathering). Later on in the 18th century a new word was appearing in writings and was since then was known as a \"bōnenkai\" or year-end party and a \"shinnenkai\" is the same type of celebration.\n\nAlthough the Japanese have always been a people of great feeling and emotion as in the expression \"mono no aware\", they are more reserved in expressing their feelings to others, so the \"shinnenkai\" has been a way of showing public displays of gratitude. This is especially true for the company or business office \"shinnenkai\" where they can do \"bureikō\" or let their hair down and not worry about the boss/employee formal relationship or the rank and age divisions and have a good time.\n\nWhen a business decides to have a \"shinnenkai\" they take into account several things before planning a party. Some of their concerns are to ensure that enough of the employees and management will attend. They also try to set a generalized cost of no more than 5,000 yen per person; this is used to cover the cost of the party and to not discourage employees from attending a party that is too expensive. Some companies pay the entire cost of the party and will at times opt to not have the party at a traditional \"izakaya\" (restaurant and drinking places where the majority of \"shinnenkai\" are held) and instead have it on the business premises and save a lot of money in the process.\n\nStatistically, more people attend \"bōnenkai\" than \"shinnenkai\" parties.

Furthermore, in Australia, Arnott's has stated that tray packs of Wagon Wheels were in fact 'Mini Wagon Wheels' and have re-released the original 48g Wagon Wheels.\n\nThe original factory in Slough produced the biscuit with crinkled edges and corn cobbs rather than the updated smoother edges. This caused the overall diameter of the biscuit to shrink slightly, but not as much as fans of the biscuit believe.\n\nAlso, although the UK Wagon Wheel has barely shrunk, it is still noticeably smaller than the Australian equivalent. the diameter of the Australian version is measured at 88 mm which is 14 mm larger than the UK version, while the UK Wagon Wheel is notably thicker by 4 mm.\n\nInterest in Wagon Wheels was at an all-time peak when the British comedians French and Saunders made a sketch with Jennifer Saunders dressed as a schoolgirl stuffing a Wagon Wheel into her mouth.\n\nBritish comedians Hale and Pace used Wagon Wheels in their recurring \"Curly & Nige\" sketches, as the Curly and Nige characters won Wagon Wheels from each other by doing self-mutilating and dangerous bets.\n\nWagon Wheels are thrown into the audience by Berwick Kaler during the popular annual York Theatre Royal pantomime.\n\nWagon Wheels were \"re-launched\" in 2002.\n\nPrevious slogans for the product have been:\n\nThe current slogan is \"You've got to grin to get it in\".\n\nWagon Wheels were chosen by Judge Paul Hollywood as the technical challenge for the first episode in series 9 of \"The Great British Bake Off\".\n\nThe original wagon wheel which is now called \"chocolate\" had a marshmallow centre and not a jam centre.\n\n\n\n"}

If we color the edges with two colors, some two adjacent edges will have the same color x; the path formed by those two edges will have the repetitive color sequence xx. If we color the edges with three colors, one of the three colors will be used only once; the path of four edges formed by the other two colors will either have two consecutive edges or will form the repetitive color sequence xyxy. However, with four colors it is not difficult to avoid all repetitions. Therefore, the Thue number of \"C\" is four.\n\nAlon et al. use the Lovász local lemma to prove that the Thue number of any graph is at most quadratic in its maximum degree; they provide an example showing that for some graphs this quadratic dependence is necessary. In addition they show that the Thue number of a path of four or more vertices is exactly three, and that the Thue number of any cycle is at most four, and that the Thue number of the Petersen graph is exactly five.\n\nThe known cycles with Thue number four are \"C\", \"C\", \"C\", \"C\", \"C\", and \"C\". Alon et al. conjecture that the Thue number of any larger cycle is three; they verified computationally that the cycles listed above are the only ones of length ≤ 2001 with Thue number four. Currie resolved this in a 2002 paper, showing that all cycles with 18 or more vertices have Thue number 3.\n\nTesting whether a coloring has a repetitive path is in NP, so testing whether a coloring is nonrepetitive is in co-NP, and Manin showed that it is co-NP-complete. The problem of finding such a coloring belongs to formula_1 in the polynomial hierarchy, and again Manin showed that it is complete for this level.\n\n"}

Monti wanted to create a new recipe following the current traditions of Italian cuisine. The dish was named in honor of the famous Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso (1873–1921) who was a popular figure in South America during his tours of the 1910s.\n\nThe sauce was originally thought to be a variant of bechamel but its flavor is distinctly different. Several culinary seminars referred to Caruso sauce as \"the new invention\" and it gained international culinary recognition. In recent decades, the sauce has become increasingly popular in most South American and Western European countries.\n\nAt present, the sauce is considered as part of the Uruguayan cultural heritage and is urged by the Asociación Uruguaya de Gastronomía (Uruguayan Cuisine Association) to be included in the menu of every restaurant or food outlet within the limits of the country. Due to the shared cultural background existing between Uruguay and Argentina, it is not unusual to encounter Caruso sauce on restaurant menus in Buenos Aires.

The brewery was founded by František Ringhoffer in Velké Popovice, a town 25 km (15 mi) southeast of Prague. Their symbol is a goat (Kozel means \"male goat\" in Czech). The company was bought by SABMiller in 2002 and sold to Asahi Breweries in 2016.\n\nThe first historical mention of the brewery dates back to the 14th century. The brewery in Velke Popovice, as we know it today, has its origins in the 19th century. After years of disagreements and the gradual decline of the brewery, it was bought by a rich industrial tycoon, František Ringhoffer, who was the Mayor of Smíchov and one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Czech history.\n\nThe brewery was built in 1875, though the first batch of Kozel beer was brewed in the previous year. The brewery, thanks to its owner, introduced new technologies, giving rise to its modern history. At the turn of the 20th century the brewery passed through its second major reconstruction and its production capacity was increased to 90,000 hectoliters per year from the original 18,000 in the beginning.\n\nThe First World War brewery survived, operating in a restricted mode and without much innovation. It grew again in the period between the wars. Kozel became famous for its dark 14° beer \"Bock\". However the Second World War brought restrictions again in the production of beer for all breweries. The protectorate brewery had problems in requiring the raw materials needed for the production of beer.\n\nAfter the war, the brewery was nationalized and faced a lack of workers. In 1951, therefore, the management company solved this problem by employing the first-ever women in the brewery. The ratio of women and men remained almost the same until 1962 and bottling was exclusively in female hands. In 1965 Kozel delivered the world's first beer in tank trucks and gave rise to the tradition of the tank brasseries.\n\nAfter thirty years of socialism the brewery achieved independence in 1991 and in 1992 became a public limited company. In 2002, Kozel merged with the brewery Radegast and the Pilsner Urquell brewery conglomerate SABMiller. In 2016 it was one of the brands sold by SABMiller to Asahi Breweries as a result of the acquisition of the former by ABInBev.\n\nIn 2012, Kozel canned beer was in the context of viral advertising in Russia launched into space, beer dropped by parachute and everything was transmitted by online camera.\n\nThe name Kozel and its emblem have their origins in the period after the First World War. At that time there was a lot of competition in brewing. Brewery founder Emanuel Ringhoffer realized that it was necessary to distinguish the brewery. He started to brew in Velke Popovice a strong, dark beer according to local tradition, which was known locally as Kozel. At that time a French painter passed through Velke Popovice. He was moved by the hospitality of the local people, and out of gratitude decided to create for them an emblem for the brewery. The painter was inspired by the figure of the goat, and put it in the form of an emblem. Since then, each beer from Velke Popovice was known as Kozel and the animal mascot has decorated the label for almost a hundred years.\n\nIn the 1930s the owners tried to firm and consolidate the position of the brewery and to give it a more attractive image, so they brought a live goat to the brewery as an attraction. The Kozel brewery still has a live mascot and other attractions for visitors today. From the 1970s, after a few generations all the goats have been named after the original caregiver Olda and this name has been passed down from goat to goat for over 40 years.\n\nThe brewery in Velké Popovice can be visited throughout the year, it is only needed to check opening time or book a tour Brewery tours offer you unprecedented access to all important areas of the brewery. From enjoying a beer in the old brewhouse to exploring the cellars, you will end the day with a much richer knowledge of both Czech history and how a traditional beer is made.\n\nThe company brews these different types of beer:\n\nKozel has won many different awards including the Australian Beer Award, the Czech Beer of the Year, the World Beer Cup and more. Kozel Premium won awards at the World Beer Championships in Chicago in 1995, 1996 and 1997.\n\nKozel became the best-selling Czech beer brand in the world. It is now sold in about thirty countries worldwide. Licensed production began in January 2001 in the Slovak Republic and continued into the east. Kozel progressed over the Russian Kaluga and Ulyanovsk to Vladivostok. In Hungary Kozel settled in Budapest and in the Ukraine in Donetsk. Recently Kozel has entered new markets in Scandinavia, Great Britain, Canada, Israel, Greece and Kazakhstan. Efes Moldova, Efes Georgia and Efes Turkey have started Kozel Production. Czech premium beer Kozel Dark is showing steep growth in the Korean beer market. Kozel Dark's sales in the first to three months of this year increased about 271% (about four times) compared to the same period last year. The main reason for Kozel Dark's increase in sales volume is diversification of consumer tastes. In addition, Kozel Dark's stores have increased more than 30 times in the last two years. The average monthly sales of stores in Itaewon, Hongdae, and Gangnam, which are Seoul's major commercial areas, have averaged more than 1.6 million pieces per month.\n\nAwards which has Kozel received in Czech and International beer competitions.\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\n1997-1998, 2000-2005\n\n1995-1997, 1999\n\n\n"}

Variations of what North Americans consider a \"Chicken Sandwich\" include the chicken burger or chicken on a bun, hot chicken, and chicken salad sandwich.\n\nIn North America, the sandwich usually consists of a chicken filet or patty, toppings and bread. The chicken can be deep fried, grilled, roasted or boiled, served hot or cold, and white or dark meat chicken can be used. Shredded chicken in one form or another, such as chicken salad, can also be used in chicken sandwiches. Wrap versions of the sandwich can also be made, in which the ingredients are rolled up inside a flatbread, such as a tortilla.\n\nOpen-faced versions of the sandwich, which feature hot chicken served with gravy on top of bread, are also common variations.\n\nSome establishments serving hamburgers also serve chicken sandwiches, giving customers an alternative to beef. Such a sandwich may also be called \"chicken on a bun\" or \"chicken burger\" in Australia or the UK, and is served on a hamburger bun with similar condiments and toppings as found on hamburgers. While most chicken sandwiches in this context usually use fried or grilled chicken breasts, a chicken burger may also be made of a grilled or fried patty of ground chicken.\n\nChick-fil-A claims that it invented the fried chicken sandwich in the 1940s. This claim is unsubstantiated, though the Chick-fil-A southern-style chicken sandwich (served with pickles on a steamed roll), introduced on March 21, 1964, was most likely the first chicken sandwich introduced by a fast food restaurant chain. Other notable vendors of chicken sandwiches include KFC and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Today, most major fast food, fast casual and casual dining chains feature some sort of chicken sandwich, even at restaurants where chicken is not a specialty.\n\nChicken salad served between slices of bread is a chicken sandwich variation seen both in North America and elsewhere.\n\nIn Ireland, the popular \"chicken fillet roll\" is a baguette filled with a spicy or plain breaded chicken fillet and a mayonnaise or butter spread.\n\nThe hot chicken sandwich or simply \"hot chicken\" (Quebec French: \"sandwich chaud au poulet\") is a type of chicken sandwich consisting of chicken, sliced bread, and gravy. The sandwich is usually served with green peas and commonly found in Eastern Canadian cuisine. It's especially popular in Quebec and is often considered one of the province's staple dishes. Since it is so commonly found in eateries of Quebec (Rôtisserie St-Hubert, Valentine, e.g.) and less seen outside the province, many Québécois regard it as a part of Quebec cuisine and believe it to have originated in the province. This combination of chicken, gravy, and peas is known by its own term: \"galvaude\", seen in \"poutine galvaude\".\n\nAlthough less featured in other areas of North America, the sandwich is also found in small diners from the Canadian Maritimes and throughout the Southeastern United States.\n\nThe sandwich was a working-class dish already common and well established in North American cuisine by the early 1900s and featured on the food menus of pharmacists and druggists of the time. Due to its ease of preparation and its minimal costs, the sandwich was also widely served in the mess halls and cafeterias of the mid-1900s.\n\nThis style of sandwich often makes use of leftovers from a previous meal. Substituting turkey for the chicken would make a \"hot turkey sandwich\" and substituting roast beef makes a variety of the roast beef sandwich.\n\nThe pepito is a sandwich that is prepared with chicken or beef, beans or refried beans and a roll or bun as primary ingredients. It is a common street food in Mexico and Venezuela.\n\nFound in Ohio is the \"shredded chicken sandwich\". The sandwich is also referred to as a \"hot chicken sandwich\" in rural Ohio. The sandwich consists of shredded chicken, one or more types of condensed soup, seasoning and crushed crackers to help thicken and bind the sauce. This dish can be heated on a stove top or slow cooker. Invented as a way to use leftover chicken, these sandwiches became popular for covered dish dinners, potlucks, church dinners and tailgate parties. They are also sold in small-town restaurants, drive-ins and bars. The sandwich can also be found at \"Ohio\" community dinners on the Gulf Coast of Florida held by retirees or snowbirds from Ohio.\n\n\n"}

Watkins felt that the name came about because the snail's two horns resembled a surveyor's two surveying rods. Watkins also supported this idea with an etymology from 'doddering along' and 'dodge' (akin, in his mind, to the series of actions a surveyor would carry out in moving his rod back and forth until it accurately lined up with another one as a backsight or foresight) and the Welsh verb 'dodi' meaning to lay or place. He thus decided that The Long Man of Wilmington was an image of an ancient surveyor.\n"}

Owned but not marketed in the UK and Europe by United Biscuits, in the United States and Canada the brand is owned by Mondelēz International, whilst in Pakistan the brand is owned by English Biscuit Manufacturers.\n\nJames Peek (1800–1879) was one of three brothers born in Dodbrooke, Devon, to a well-off family. In 1821 the three brothers founded a tea importation company, established as Peek Brothers and Co., in the East End of London. By the 1840s, the company was importing £5M of tea per annum.\n\nIn 1824, Peek married Elizabeth Masters (1799–1867). The couple had eight children. By 1857, two of his late-teenage sons had announced that they were not going to join the family tea import business. Peek wanted them in a complementary trade and proposed that they start a biscuit business. After founding the business, the two sons quickly decided on a different course (one died in his early 20s; the other emigrated to North America). As a consequence Peek needed someone to run the biscuit business. One of his nieces, Hannah Peek, had recently married George Hender Frean, a miller and ship biscuit maker in Devon, so Peek wrote to Frean asking him to manage the new biscuit business.\n\nThe partners registered their business in 1857 as Peek, Frean & Co. Ltd, based in a disused sugar refinery on Mill Street in Dockhead, South East \nLondon, in the west of Bermondsey. With a quickly expanding business, in 1860 Peek engaged his friend James Carr, the apprenticed son of the Carlisle-based Scottish milling and biscuit making family, Carr's.\n\nFrom 1861, the company started exporting biscuits to Australia, but outgrew their premises from 1870 after agreeing to fulfil an order from the French Army for of biscuits for the ration packs supplied to soldiers fighting the Franco-Prussian War. After hostilities ended, the French Government ordered a further /11 million sweet Pearl biscuits in celebration of the end of the Siege of Paris, and further flour supplies for Paris in 1871 and 1872, with financing undertaken by their bankers the Rothschilds. The consequential consumer demands of emigrating French expatriate soldiers, allowed the company to start exporting directly to Ontario, Canada from the mid-1870s.\n\nIn 1865 Peek agreed with Carr that the business needed bigger premises. In exchange for a stake in the business, Carr gave the company of market gardens he had recently bought on Clements Road and Drummond Road, Bermondsey. Commissioning a new integrated factory, its resultant scale and sweet-emanating smell resulted in Bermondsey gaining the nickname \"Biscuit Town\". The opening of the factory coincided in 1866 with James Peek stepping down from the business, installing his son-in-law Thomas Stone in his place. \n\nOn 23 April 1873 the old Dockhead factory burnt down in a spectacular fire, which brought the Prince of Wales out on a London Fire Brigade horse-drawn water pump to view the resulting explosions.\n\nJames Peek died aged 79 at his home in Watcome near Torquay, Devon. After George Frean's son James Frean retired in 1887, his family had nothing more to do with running the business. Peek's nephew Francis Hedley Peek became the first chairman of the now publicly listed company in 1901, but on his death in 1904 again the Peek family had nothing more to do with managing the business. James Carr's family remained actively associated with the business for several more generations.\n\nIn 1906, the Peek, Frean and Co. factory in Bermondsey was the subject of one of the earliest documentary films shot by Cricks and Sharp. This was in part to celebrate an expansion of the company's cake business, which later made the wedding cakes for both Queen Elizabeth II and the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer. In 1949, when James Carr's relative Rupert Carr established a new biscuit factory in York, he named the new street on which it stood \"Bermondsey Road\".\n\nIn 1924, the company established their first factory outside the UK, in Dum Dum, India. In 1949 they establishment their first bakery in Canada, located on Bermondsey Road in East York, Ontario, which still today produces Peek Freans branded products..\n\nAfter 126 years, the London factory was closed by then owner BSN on Wednesday 26 May 1989. Left derelict for a long period, the former premises were eventually redeveloped into what today is called the Tower Bridge Business Complex. In late 2011, a tinned Christmas pudding was discovered at the back of a kitchen cupboard in Poole, Dorset. Donated to the museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, it was a \"Peek, Frean & Co's Teetotal Plum Pudding—London, High Class Ingredients Only\" from the 1900s. It was one of a thousand puddings sent on behalf of Agnes \"Aggie\" Weston, superintendent of the Royal Naval Temperance Society – hence its recipe being teetotal), (alcohol-free) – to British troops during the Boer War.\n\nFrom the outset of its establishment, the company produced what were then the established form of biscuits in the Commonwealth countries, a hard, square, pin-pricked (known as \"docker-holes\", introduced by the baker to stop the biscuit expanding like a bread) dry style, suitable for storage on ships in passage due to its longevity. However, Carr brought his knowledge of both the Scottish cake-like tradition (i.e.: shortbread), and experience during his apprenticeship of Dutch sweet and soft cookies. With James Peek still viewing the business as a complementary and co-marketing opportunity to the families tea company, they began introducing sweetened product lines:\n\nLike many good employers of the Victorian age, the company developed an enlightened matriarch-like approach, giving many innovative benefits to its employees. At its Biscuit Town factory, much like a mini-town, as well as having: an on-site bank, post office and fire station; employees and their families had free-to-use access to on-site medical, dental and optical services. The original contracted hours were 68 across a Monday-Saturday double-shift pattern, but these were reduced from 1868 without a reduction in pay, noted as highly beneficial by Henry Mayhew. The directors wanted to ensure that the workers didn't indulge in \"virtuous pursuits\", and so formed the first of the company paid-for societies, included: a cricket club (1868); musical society (1907); and athletic and dramatic societies (both 1908). Post-World War I, the company set up a tribunal, through which workers could freely express and debate their concerns. This resulted in the company giving its employees a pension plan, plus a week's paid holiday per year.\n\nIn 1921, Peek Frean entered into an amalgamation agreement with rival biscuit firm Huntley and Palmers, resulting in the creation of a holding company, Associated Biscuit Manufacturers Ltd (ABM). However, both biscuit firms retained their own brands and premises. Jacob's joined the conglomerate from 1961. English Biscuit Manufacturers (EBM) was established in Pakistan as a local joint-venture production company from 1965, which still owns the various brand rights in the country.\n\nDuring the course of its life, the firm's brand name changed from Peek, Frean and Co. to Peek Frean (in the early twentieth century) and then to Peek Freans (by the 1970s, the name having been used in the possessive case on products for many years).\n\nThe company was broken apart from 1982, after Nabisco bought ABM. In 1985, Nabisco was acquired by the foods division of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, resulting in the creation of conglomerate RJR Nabisco. After RJR Nabisco was bought in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, to pay down the resultant debt pile, various assets were sold off. This included dividing the former Peek Freans company; the North America division was sold to Kraft Foods, the European mainly-UK division was sold to the European food conglomerate BSN (now known as Groupe Danone), and many of the international subsidiaries were sold off locally to in-country investors, e.g. EBM. As part of its cost cutting, BSN ended use and marketing of the brand in the UK, which allowed it to shut the factory in Bermondsey. In September 2004 United Biscuits bought what was by then known as the Jacob's Biscuit Group for £240M from Groupe Danone. \n\nIn 2017, the Peek Frean trademark was acquired by the great-great-great-grandson of Francis Peek, the first Chairman of Peek Frean and the son of James Peek.\n\n\n"}

The Venus throw could be used to designate the master of the revels.\n\n\"The Venus Throw\" is also a novel in the Roma Sub Rosa series set in ancient republican Rome by author Steven Saylor.\n\n"}

An abundance of sugar and slave labour were crucial for its confection, in large cauldrons cooking over a slow fire. It is a conserve made of red guavas and sugar. In rural areas of Brazil, it is still commonly made at home for family use or by home industry outlets (traditional recipes) or as processed food. It is a deep slightly bluish red colour, sometimes a very dark hue of red.\n\nIt is known as guava paste or guava cheese throughout the English-speaking Americas, especially the Caribbean and pasta de guayaba or guayabate in Spanish-speaking Americas. It is commercially available, most often packaged in flat metal cans, or as long rectangular blocks in chipboard boxes. It is called \"perad\" in Goa, a former Portuguese colony.\n\nIn Brazil, \"goiabada\" is often eaten with Minas cheese. This combination is referred to as \"Romeo and Juliet.\" It is also popular spread on toast at breakfast. In Portugal, it is used as the filling of the popular \"bolo de rosas\" (rose cake) in which a layer of pastry is covered with \"goiabada\", then rolled and cut into pieces that resemble roses. This same cake is called \"rocambole\" in Brazil, and also uses a layer of pastry covered with \"goiabada\", then rolled and served, as a Swiss roll. Another popular dessert is the bolo de rolo.\n\n\"Goiabada\" may come in many widely different possible textures, ranging from a thin paste, meant to be eaten with a spoon or spread on bread or cakes, to very hard slabs that can be sliced with a knife only with some difficulty. Canned varieties are usually half-way between those extremes, being easily cut into soft slices. The many different kinds of \"goiabada\" depend on the type of guava, the proportion of sugar, the amount of water, and the cooking process. In Brazil, the most widely accepted to be the best (for \"Romeo and Juliet\") is called \"goiabada cascão\" (a medium to hard variety, with fragments of guava fruit in the paste).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7438610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7438610", "title": "Dr Pepper", "text": "Dr Pepper\n\nDr Pepper is a carbonated soft drink marketed as having a unique flavor. The drink was created in the 1880s by pharmacist Charles Alderton in Waco, Texas and first served around 1885. Dr Pepper was first nationally marketed in the United States in 1904, and is now also sold in Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Australia, as well as New Zealand and South Africa as an imported good. Variants include a version without high fructose corn syrup, Diet Dr Pepper, as well as a line of additional flavors, first introduced in the 2000s.\n\nThe name \"Dr. Pepper\" was first used commercially in 1885. It was introduced nationally in the United States at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition as a new kind of soda pop, made with 23 flavors. Its introduction in 1885 preceded the introduction of Coca-Cola by one year.\n\nIt was formulated by Brooklyn-born pharmacist Charles Alderton in Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas. To test his new drink, he first offered it to store owner Wade Morrison, who also found it to his liking. Patrons at Morrison's soda fountain soon learned of Alderton's new drink and began ordering a \"Waco\". Alderton gave the formula to Morrison, who named it Dr. Pepper (later stylized as \"Dr Pepper\").\n\nAs with Coca-Cola, the formula for Dr Pepper is a trade secret, and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate Dallas banks. A persistent rumor since the 1930s is that the drink contains prune juice, but the official Dr Pepper FAQ refutes this with \"Dr Pepper is a unique blend of natural and artificial flavors; it does not contain prune juice.\" The origin of the rumor is unknown; some believe it was started by a deliveryman for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune juice's laxative effects, but it may simply be because many people feel that Dr Pepper tastes similar to prune juice.\n\nIn 2009, an old ledger book filled with formulas and recipes was discovered by Bill Waters while shopping at antiques stores in the Texas Panhandle. Several sheets and letterheads hinted it had come from the W.B. Morrison & Co. Old Corner Drug Store (the same store where Dr Pepper was first served in 1885) and faded letters on the book's cover spelled out \"Castles Formulas\". John Castles was a partner of Morrison's for a time and worked at that location as early as 1880. One recipe in the book titled \"D Peppers Pepsin Bitters\" was of particular interest, and some speculated it could be an early recipe for Dr Pepper. However, Keurig Dr Pepper insists it is not the formula for Dr Pepper, but is instead a medicinal recipe for a digestive aid. The book was put up for auction in May 2009, but no one purchased it.\n\nTheories about the origins of the soft drink's name abound. One possible reason why the name was chosen was the practice, common at the time of the drink’s creation, of including \"Dr.\" in the names of products to convey the impression that they were healthful.\n\nA theory often cited is that the drink was named after an actual doctor, one Charles T. Pepper of Rural Retreat, Virginia. Morrison may have named the drink after the doctor in gratitude for Pepper having given Morrison his first job. However, Milly Walker, Collections Manager / Curator for the Dublin (Texas) Dr Pepper Bottling Co. Museum, has stated that U.S. Census records show that a young Morrison lived in Christiansburg, Virginia, 40 miles away from Rural Retreat, and that \"there is not one piece of evidence that Morrison ever worked for Charles T. Pepper in Rural Retreat\". Another story tells of Morrison naming the drink after Charles T. Pepper because the doctor granted Morrison permission to marry Pepper's daughter, but the girl in question was only eight years old at the time that Morrison moved to Waco.\n\nA Dr. Pepper of Christiansburg is another possible inspiration for the soft drink's name. In the census that shows Morrison living in Christiansburg and working as a pharmacy clerk, a Dr. Pepper is recorded on a subsequent page. Since census takers at this time were walking from door to door, and these census entries are close to each other in the record, it appears that Morrison and this Dr. Pepper lived close to each other. Furthermore, Pepper is recorded as having a 16-year-old daughter, named Malinda or Malissa.\nThe period (full stop) after \"Dr\" was used intermittently in Dr Pepper logos until the 1950s, when, after some debate, it was discarded permanently, for stylistic and legibility reasons. A logo that debuted at that time had slanted text, in which \"Dr.\" resembled \"Di:\".\n\nIn 1951, Dr Pepper sued the Coca-Cola company for US$750,000, asserting that nickel Coca-Colas were sold below cost and were a restraint of trade.\n\nIn 1972, Dr Pepper sued the Coca-Cola company for trademark infringement based on a soft drink marketed by Coca-Cola called \"Peppo\". Coca-Cola renamed their beverage Dr. Pibb, which was also determined to violate the trademark. The soft drink was later renamed Mr Pibb.\n\nDr Pepper became insolvent in the early 1980s, prompting an investment group to take the company private. Several years later, Coca-Cola attempted to acquire Dr Pepper, but was blocked from doing so by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Around the same time, Seven Up was acquired from Phillip Morris by the same investment company that bailed out Dr Pepper. Upon the failure of the Coca-Cola merger, Dr Pepper and Seven Up merged (creating Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc., or DPSU), giving up international branding rights in the process. After the DPSU merger, Coca-Cola obtained most non-US rights to the Dr Pepper name (with PepsiCo taking the Seven Up rights).\n\nDr Pepper was a frequent player in the 1990s antitrust history of the United States. As part of these activities, economists and the courts have weighed in with the opinion that Dr Pepper is a \"pepper\" flavored drink and not a \"cola\". In 1995, the FTC blocked a merger between The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper on grounds that included concerns about a monopoly of the \"pepper\" flavor category of soft drinks. In 1996, Dr Pepper was involved in an antitrust case involving Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys, NFL Properties, Nike, and other commercial interests active at Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas. Jones had made deals with Dr Pepper and the other companies that, the league said, violated their exclusive marketing contracts with Coca-Cola and other businesses. The NFL agreed to allow Jones and other teams to pursue their own agreements.\n\nIn 1998, the \"pepper\" flavor soda category was a major part of the analysis supporting an antitrust case between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\n\n\nMuch of the soft drink industry in the United States stopped using sugar in the 1980s, in response to a series of price supports and import quotas introduced beginning in 1982 that increased the price of sugar above the global market price. As a result, most US soft drinks, including Dr Pepper, now use high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar.\n\nA handful of United States bottling plants still use sugar to sweeten Dr Pepper. The Dr Pepper bottling plant in Dublin, Texas used to produce such a beverage, known as Dublin Dr Pepper. In the 1980s, plant owner W.P. \"Bill\" Kloster (June 7, 1918 September 27, 1999) refused to convert the plant to high fructose corn syrup. Other bottlers still using sugar include Temple Bottling Company, in Temple, Texas, Ab-Tex in Abilene, and West Jefferson Dr Pepper (WJDP) of West Jefferson, NC.\n\nOn March 25, 2007, Coca-Cola bottlers in the Dr Pepper Heartland commenced sales of 16 ounce cans of Dr Pepper made with cane sugar and featuring a logo with 'Old Doc' on them. This product was scheduled to be a limited time release.\n\nIn January 2009, \"Heritage Dr Pepper\" became available in select markets in cans and 16 oz bottles with the distinction \"Made with Real Sugar.\"\n\nBeginning in July 2010, Dr Pepper's 125th Anniversary edition in some markets was made with sugar as opposed to other sweeteners. Since Dr Pepper Corporate has no control over whether the bottlers will use sugar, there is no guarantee the soda will have sugar.\n\nAs of January 2012, the bottling plant in Dublin, Texas, is no longer bottling Dr Pepper.\n\nThe soft drink industry in some other countries never stopped using sugar as a sweetener. For instance in the European Union, high fructose corn syrup is subject to a production quota. In 2005, this quota was set at 303,000 tons; in comparison, the EU produced an average of 18.6 million tons of sugar annually between 1999 and 2001. Therefore, most European soft drink producers, including most Dr Pepper bottling plants, still use sugar to sweeten their products. However, the bottlers of Dr Pepper in Germany and the United Kingdom use instead a combination of sugar and artificial sweeteners.\n\nIn the United States, Keurig Dr Pepper does not have a complete network of bottlers and distributors, so the drink is sometimes bottled under contract by Coca-Cola or Pepsi bottlers. Prior to the initial Cadbury Schweppes investment-turned-buyout, 30% of Dr Pepper/Seven Up products were produced and distributed by Pepsi bottlers, and another 30% by Coca-Cola bottlers. The remaining 40% were produced and distributed by independent bottlers (mainly consisting of Dr Pepper/Seven Up premerger regional bottlers) and the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group. Currently, the majority of Pepsi and Coke bottlers bottling Dr Pepper are owned by PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company after their buyouts of their major bottlers.\n\nPresently, Dr Pepper Snapple relies on its own bottling group to bottle and distribute its products in more than 30 states. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have essentially stopped bottling and distributing Cadbury-Schweppes products in favor of in-house alternatives, although regional exceptions can be found.\n\nIn Canada and Poland, Cadbury-Schweppes has licensed distribution rights to PepsiCo. In Mexico, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Finland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Belgium, and Norway, Cadbury-Schweppes owns the trademark and distributes the product. In Romania, it can be found only in larger cities, imported from Belgium. In Portugal, Spain, France, Turkey, and Greece, it is almost impossible to find, as it is usually imported from the United Kingdom in particular supermarkets. In almost all of the other countries of the world, the Coca-Cola Company purchased the trademark from Cadbury-Schweppes and distributes the product. This mixed worldwide ownership of the trademark is due to antitrust regulations which prevented Coca-Cola from purchasing the rights everywhere. Dr Pepper is also available in Russia (though imported, generally from Poland — there's no local bottling despite numerous talks), South Korea and Ukraine. Although no longer locally bottled in Australia or New Zealand, Dr Pepper is imported and sold by United States Foods, and many other small retailers in Australia, with the UK (sugar) version sold in the British sections of Coles and Woolworths supermarkets. Dr Pepper is not available in Thailand, North Korea and Serbia. It is rarely sold in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, as it is imported from the United States.\n\nDr Pepper has been sold in Japan since 1973 and is widely available in greater Tokyo, Okinawa and parts of the Tōkai region, where it is distributed by local Coca-Cola bottlers. It is not actively marketed in other regions of Japan; Coca-Cola's Osaka bottler began selling Dr Pepper in 1983, but pulled the product two years later due to low sales.\n\n\n\"Dr Pepper Time\", according to one promotion, was at 10, 2 and 4 o'clock. During World War II, a syndicated radio program, \"The 10–2–4 Ranch\" (later titled \"10–2–4 Time\"), aired in the South and other areas where Dr Pepper was distributed. The show featured the Sons of the Pioneers and Dick Foran. In the 1960s, the tune of the chorus of \"The Glow-Worm\" was used in ads, with lyrics which ended, \"It's Dr Pepper Time!\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Dr Pepper released the \"Charge\" ad:\nThe \"Be a Pepper\" series referred to fans of Dr Pepper as \"Peppers\", and often featured large, sequential, crowd dance scenes, intricately choreographed by Tony Stevens and led onscreen by actor David Naughton. A recurring jingle was:\nThis became grist for a number of pop culture references and parodies. One of the first was a July 1981 sketch on the program \"SCTV\", in which an overly-excited injured man (Eugene Levy) extols the work of a \"Dr Shekter\" (Rick Moranis) who has been treating him. Levy and a group of patients wearing casts and crutches engage in their own elaborate dancing and singing (\"Wouldn't you like to see my doctor, too?\"), which Shekter first uses as an opportunity to explain his work, and then grows alarmed (\"These people should not be dancing!\"). In the 1982 sex farce \"Beach Girls\", the slogan became \"I'm a popper, he's a popper...\" Wreck-Gar parodied the slogan in \"The Return of Optimus Prime\".\n\nAfter appearing in a series of commercials, David Naughton had his breakthrough film role as the main character in the John Landis film \"An American Werewolf in London\". Another famous \"I'm a Pepper\" dancer was Ray Bolger, the actor who played the Scarecrow in the film \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nIn the early 1960s, Dr Pepper promoted the idea of serving the drink hot with lemon slices in winter. This idea appeared in the film \"Blast from the Past\" initially set in the early 1960s.\nIn 1978, Jake Holmes wrote the lyrics to \"Be a Pepper\". Earlier in the 1970s, Randy Newman wrote another jingle entitled \"The Most Original Soft Drink Ever\". Barry Manilow performed Holmes's jingle in concerts and on albums under the inclusion of \"VSM – Very Strange Medley\". A TV commercial was also created using the jingle and ran from 1977 to 1985. The song noted \"It's not a cola, it's something much much more. It's not a root beer, you get root beer by the score.\" (W.W. Clements, former CEO and president of the Dr Pepper/7-Up Company, similarly described the taste of Dr Pepper as one-of-a-kind, saying, \"I've always maintained you cannot tell anyone what Dr Pepper tastes like because it's so different. It's not an apple, it's not an orange, it's not a strawberry, it's not a root beer, it's not even a cola. It's a different kind of drink with a unique taste all its own.\")\n\nDr Pepper has also been featured outside the \"I'm a Pepper\" motif. An example is in the video game \"Pikmin 2\", where one of the collectible treasures is a Dr Pepper bottle cap (it is labeled as the \"Drought Ender\"). Also, an empty Dr Pepper bottle is featured in the book \"Ragweed\" by Newbery Medal-winning author Avi; the book’s illustrator, Brian Floca, is the son of a Dr Pepper bottler. Several of the classic non-\"I'm a Pepper\" commercials featured prominent movie stars, one being a television advertisement with Chris Rock as a child enjoying a Dr Pepper.\n\nThe 1980s \"Out of the Ordinary\" advertising campaign involved a series of postapocalyptic commercials featuring a space cowboy and an alien sidekick seeking \"something different\" from a simple generic cola. The campaign also produced commercials featuring the movie creature Godzilla, where citizens of a Japanese town offered Dr Pepper as a libation. The commercials were prominently featured during the 1986 syndication of \"The Canned Film Festival\", which was sponsored by the Dr Pepper Company.\n\nOutside the United States, Squeeze's Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford played for a Dr Pepper advert in the UK with the slogan, \"Hold out for the out of the ordinary.\"\n\nDr Pepper's \"Be You\" advertising campaign centered on commercials featuring pairs of popular musicians, including LeAnn Rimes with Reba McEntire, Paulina Rubio with Celia Cruz, Thalía with Tito Puente, B2K with Smokey Robinson, Anastacia with Cyndi Lauper, Patricia Manterola with Ana Gabriel, and LL Cool J with Run-D.M.C. The campaign also featured individual musicians, notably Garth Brooks.\n\nDr Pepper made several appearances in the 1994 Robert Zemeckis major motion picture \"Forrest Gump\", as it was the beverage of choice for the movie's namesake lead character, played by Tom Hanks. In one of the film's Dr Pepper scenes, Forrest's narrative suggests, \"The best part about goin' to the White House was, they had all the food and drink that you wanted ... I must have had me 15 Dr Peppers.\" When subsequently asked by the President how he felt, Forrest gave an honest answer of \"I gotta pee.\" Although, arguably the film's largest product placement installation, the depiction of Dr Pepper was perhaps not always accurate as, in another scene during the 1972 New Year's Eve celebration which Forrest attends, he drinks a Dr Pepper with a logo that was inconsistent with the timeline of the film.\n\nIn Australia, a report on the soft drink industry by IBIS accused Cadbury Schweppes of failing in their marketing of the brand, given its global appeal. One potential problem with the marketing campaign was in advertising it as \"American\". The use of the Statue of Liberty moving to Australia and passing cans of Dr Pepper on to two Australian males made its imported (i.e. \"non-Australian\") status clear.\n\nAfter withdrawing from the Australian market, Dr Pepper arrived without fanfare in New Zealand. Cans imported from the US are available in some specialty stores in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nOn the December 20, 2000, episode of the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", Letterman jokingly referred to Dr Pepper as \"liquid manure\". After a representative of Dr Pepper complained, CBS agreed not to rerun that episode. Letterman repeatedly made assurances on the show that he was joking.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Diet Dr Pepper aired ads that promise authentic Dr Pepper taste, using the slogan \"Diet Dr Pepper tastes more like regular Dr Pepper\", parodying new ideas inferior to the originals, including XGA (not PGA) Extreme Golf, \"Green Bay Watch\" (spoof of \"Baywatch\") and a TV show \"CHimPs\" (rather than \"CHiPs\"). These ads were produced by They Might Be Giants.\n\nSeveral ads for Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper appeared on television in 2005. In one, a young woman on a blind date at a restaurant, who sips into the beverage, suddenly makes her date, restaurant patrons, and even a waitress all part of a musical sequence involving The Muppets version of the song \"Mah Nà Mah Nà\".\n\nOne campaign features the Queen song \"I Want It All\".\n\nOn January 1, 2008, the company unveiled a new TV ad campaign featuring the \"Cheers\" theme song (\"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\") performed by Gary Portnoy.\n\nIn a 2008 ad, a student in a college lecture takes a sip of Dr Pepper. When he stops drinking, the Dr Pepper can sings variations of \"Flava Licious\" (Flavor Flav), and other people in the room start dancing.\nIn 2008, Dr Pepper in the UK restarted launching its old adverts and slogan, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" They also started an on-pack promotion for free ringtones with up to 20 to collect. A commercial for this included Jesse Eisenberg being forced to be on live TV without his clothes on.\n\nAs of 2009, the slogan of the product was \"Drink it slow. Doctor's orders\". Advertising supporting the slogan has celebrities with famous relations to the word \"doctor\" (Dr. Dre, Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving, Gene Simmons (writer of the Kiss song \"Calling Dr. Love\"), et al.) or who played fictional doctors (such as Neil Patrick Harris or Kelsey Grammer) endorsing the beverage. The ads culminate with the celebrity stating, \"Trust me. I'm a doctor\", followed by the new slogan appearing onscreen with a glass of Dr Pepper.\n\nIn 2010, Dr Pepper was part of a marketing and promotional campaign with Marvel Studios to promote the summer blockbuster \"Iron Man 2\"; characters from the film adorned cans of Dr Pepper, Diet Dr Pepper, and Dr Pepper Cherry.\n\nIn 2011, rapper Pitbull appeared in a commercial with the slogan \"Let's have a real good time.\"\n\nAlso in 2011, Dr Pepper was featured in the anime \"Steins;Gate\" as Dk Pepper for copyright issues.\n\n\nIn 1963, singer Donna Loren became a spokesperson for the company when she was selected in a nationwide search to be the “Dr Pepper Girl”. National exposure followed for Loren as she promoted the drink via radio, print, television, calendars, billboards, and personal appearances. One of her first appearances for the company was as co-host with Dick Clark (whom she worked with regularly) of an ABC television special, \"Dr Pepper Celebrity Party\". She subsequently made hundreds of singing and personal appearances for Dr Pepper. In \"Dr Pepper—King of Beverages\", Dr Pepper historian Harry E. Ellis wrote, “Sparkly, vivacious and gifted with a wonderful voice, Donna was an immediate success. She became widely known in a short period as \"The Dr Pepper Girl,\" appearing at special events and on programs sponsored by the Company. Miss Loren would figure prominently in Dr Pepper’s plans for some five years, not only as an entertainer but doing commercials for radio and TV and appearing in many forms of advertising. She appeared on 24-sheet poster boards, point-of-sale and on Dr Pepper calendars.”\n\nDonna Loren’s role as Dr Pepper spokesperson led to her first appearance in the American International Pictures’ Beach Party film \"Muscle Beach Party\". Loren later explained: “Dr Pepper was involved in that [the Beach Party movies] and actually placed me as product placement. And because I could sing, they gave me a duet with Dick Dale, and then it just went on from there.” From this, she went on to appear in three more Beach Party films. Away from the company, Loren was a familiar presence in the 1960s due to her many performances on television, films, and her records for Capitol, Reprise and other labels. She represented Dr Pepper until 1968.\n\nFrom 1961 until 1981, Dr Pepper was also the sponsor of the Miss Teenage America beauty pageant.\n\nOn March 26, 2008, various media outlets reported that Dr Pepper would offer \"a free can of Dr Pepper to everyone in America\" – excluding former Guns N' Roses guitarists Buckethead and Slash – if the band released the long-awaited \"Chinese Democracy\" in 2008. Later in the day, lead vocalist Axl Rose replied to Dr Pepper on Guns N' Roses' official website and spoke of his surprise at Dr Pepper's support. Rose also said he would share his Dr Pepper with Buckethead as \"some of Buckethead's performances are on \"Chinese Democracy\"\". After it was announced that the album would be released in 2008, Dr Pepper stated that it would uphold its pledge.\n\nDr Pepper's online distribution of free coupons upon the album's release November 23, 2008, proved inadequate. Lawyers for the band threatened Dr Pepper's parent company with a lawsuit two days after the album's release. In a letter to Dr Pepper, Rose's lawyer Alan Gutman said, \"The redemption scheme your company clumsily implemented for this offer was an unmitigated disaster which defrauded consumers and, in the eyes of vocal fans, ruined \"Chinese Democracy\"'s release.\" Rose's lawyer also demanded that the company make a full-page apology that would appear in \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\", \"The New York Times\" and \"The Los Angeles Times\". In a later interview, Rose claimed he told his lawyers it was a non-issue and was surprised by their actions.\n\nThe Dr Pepper Museum, located in the Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Company building at 300 South Fifth Street in downtown Waco, Texas, opened to the public in 1991. The building was the first building to be built specifically to bottle Dr Pepper. It was completed in 1906, and Dr Pepper was bottled there until the 1960s. The museum has three floors of exhibits, a working old-fashioned soda fountain, and a gift store of Dr Pepper memorabilia.\n\nThe museum founder, Wilton Lanning, died in January 2018.\n\nThe company sells more Dr Pepper in the Roanoke Valley area of Virginia than any other metropolitan area east of the Mississippi River. Roanoke is approximately 90 miles east of the hometown of Dr. Charles T. Pepper, which is Rural Retreat, Virginia, and 30 miles east of Christiansburg, Virginia, home of Dr. Pepper and Morrison referred to in the census information above. John William \"Bill\" Davis opened the first Dr. Pepper plant east of the Mississippi in Roanoke in 1936; subsequently the city was named the \"Dr Pepper Capital of the World\" and broke world records for its mass consumption of Dr Pepper in the late 1950s. Dr Pepper donated a portion of its sales revenue in the Roanoke area to finance restoration of a circa-1950s neon Dr Pepper sign, which has the company's \"10–2–4\" logo from the time, in downtown Roanoke. In October 2015, the city of Roanoke declared October 24 (10-2-4) to be its official Dr. Pepper Day.\n\n\n"}

A common American dish is a pork tenderloin sandwich (also called simply a \"tenderloin\") – a very thinly sliced piece of pork, usually the larger, tougher loineye (longissimus) muscle, uniquely battered and breaded, which is deep fried and served in a hamburger bun, usually with garnishes such as mustard, pickle and onions. This sandwich is generally sold in the US Midwest, especially in the states of Iowa and Indiana. In the southern states, tenderloin is often prepared as a breakfast biscuit, usually with egg or cheese. It is quite common for pork tenderloin to be used as an alternative to beef tenderloin (usually called beef fillet in the UK), as it can be just as tender but costs significantly less.\n\nAlton Brown's television show \"Good Eats\" includes an episode about pork tenderloin, \"Tender is the Pork\".\n\n"}

It was covered in what appeared to be \"sand-matted grey hair four to six inches long\". A Marine Department officer who had seen it more than a week earlier, said it had then been long by about . The carcass was 15 miles from the southern end of the beach, and the article included two photographs of it. Shown photographs, John Morton, head of the zoology department at the University of Auckland, said, \"You can rule out whales because of the hair, and you can rule out sea elephants and sea cows because of its size. I can't think of anything it resembles.\" The article said that theories on the object ranged from \"a sea monster\" to \"an unusual elephant which had died at sea\", without indicating who raised these theories.\n\nThe following day, 24 March 1965, the \"Auckland Star\" reported that \"Laboratory tests by Auckland University zoology specialists on parts of the 'hairy' mass washed up on Muriwai Beach today identified it as the 'very decomposed' remains of a whale.\" Senior students had visited the carcass the previous evening and cut a sizeable chunk from it. \"Senior zoology lecturer Miss J. Robb said today the skin and most of the blubber had been scoured or eaten off the huge mound of flesh, leaving a fibrous tissue which had been so uniformly shredded it looked like hair. 'We are positive of our identification,' said Miss Robb. 'It is a very dead, very smelly whale.'\" Neither article in the \"Auckland Star\" mentioned the term \"globster\".\n\nThe September 1968 issue of \"Pursuit: Journal of the Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained\" had an article titled \"More Globsters\", which covered the Tasmanian Globster (for which the term \"globster\" was coined), the Muriwai carcass, and several similar cases in Australia and the United States. It incorrectly identified Muriwai Beach as being \"on the East Cape of North Island\" (the settlement of Muriwai on the East Cape is several hundred miles from Auckland and the nearby beach is less than 15 miles long). The January 1969 issue of \"Pursuit\" criticised the \"expert\" (unnamed, but implied as John Morton) who was \"reported\" to have said it was perhaps \"an unusual elephant\" (even though the \"Auckland Star\" did not attribute this to Morton), then noted that the \"expert\" finally said it was a decomposed whale.\n\nMarine biologist Richard Ellis's 1994 book \"Monsters of the Sea\" mentioned the \"New Zealand globster\", noting that \"Greenwell (1988) reproduced a couple of photographs of the New Zealand globster, but they are without specific identification or credit\". Ellis himself reproduced one of the photographs, with the credit saying \"Photo courtesy of Richard Greenwell and Sidney K. Pierce\". The photograph is one of the two published in the \"Auckland Star\" on 23 March 1965.\n\nThe New Zealand globster was also mentioned by cryptozoologist George Eberhart in his 2002 book \"Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology\".\n"}

It is popular in Fujian and has spread to other areas including the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia including the Malaysian towns of Sitiawan, Sibu, Ayer Tawar, Sarikei, Bintangor and other places where the dominant Chinese community is of Fuzhou (alternatively spelled Foochow or Hokchiu) ancestry (where it is sometimes nicknamed \"Foochow bagels\").\n\nKompia was named after Qi Jiguang, who invented it. When Qi Jiguang led his troops into Fujian in 1563, the Japanese pirates, fearing his name, engaged mainly in guerrilla-style battles. Qi Jiguang noticed that the Japanese pirates could always trace where his troops camped because of the smoke that rose up to the sky when the soldiers prepared their meals. He found out the Japanese pirates had no such problem because they brought onigiri with them. So Qi Jiguang invented a kind of bread with a hole in the center so that they could be strung together to be conveniently carried along. Later, to commemorate Qi Jiguang's victory against the pirate raiders, the bread was named \"guáng-bǐng\" (lit. \"Ji\"guang\" cake\").\n\nKompia is made with lard, onions, salt and flour. A ball of flour is stuffed with a filling of other desired ingredients and flattened with a rolling pin. It is then slapped onto the sides of a traditional home-made Chinese oven and takes approximately 15 minutes to bake. Meat is often used as a filling in the bread.\n\nA variant with sesame seeds scattered on top and baked without any filling is known as 麻饼. A sweet variant known as 征东饼 (literally \"Conquest of the East cake\") uses a proportion of sugar to substitute the salt in the dough.\n"}

Turkish tea culture also extends to Northern Cyprus and some countries in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nMost of the tea produced in Turkey is Rize tea, a terroir from Rize Province on the eastern Black Sea coast, which has a mild climate with high precipitation and fertile soil. This tea is usually processed as black tea.\n\nIn 2004 Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported. Furthermore, in 2004, Turkey had the highest per capita tea consumption in the world, at 2.5 kg per person—followed by the United Kingdom (2.1 kg per person).\n\nTurkish tea is typically prepared using two stacked kettles called \"çaydanlık\" specially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep (infuse) several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. When served, the remaining water is used to dilute the tea on an individual basis, giving each consumer the choice between strong (; literally \"dark\", \"tavşan kanı\" (literally: rabbit's blood) – a deep brownish red or weak (; literally \"light\"). Tea is drunk from small glasses to enjoy it hot in addition to showing its colour, with cubes of beet sugar. It is usually not taken with milk.\n\nTea is an important part of Turkish culture, and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality. Tea is most often consumed in households, shops, and by \"kıraathane\" – social gatherings of men. Despite its popularity, tea only became the beverage of choice in Turkey in the 20th century. It was initially encouraged as an alternative to coffee, which had become expensive and at times unavailable in the aftermath of World War I. Upon the loss of southeastern territories after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, coffee became an expensive import. At the urging of the founder of the republic, Atatürk, Turkish people turned more to tea as it was easily sustainable by domestic sources. Turkish tea is traditionally offered in small tulip-shaped glasses which are usually held by the rim, in order to save the drinker's fingertips from being burned, as the tea is served boiling hot.\n\nIn Turkey, herbal teas are generally used as herbal medication. They are mostly popular with foreign tourists with apple ('), rose hip ('), and linden flower (') being the most consumed flavors. Sage tea (', literally 'island tea') is most popular in the Mediterranean coastal region. \nWhereas in English Sage usually refers to Salvia officinalis, throughout Turkey various species of the plant genera Salvia, Sideritis and very rarely Stachys are usually known and consumed as sage tea.. In Turkey, herbal teas destined for the treatment of most ailments can be found in local herbal shops, called \"\". Dried herbal leaves, petals, shoots, etc. are sold in loose-leaf according to each customer's need and taste.\n\nMost often, salty or sweet biscuits called kurabiye are served with tea. Baklava is traditionally served with lemonade, not tea, as lemonade balances the cloying sweetness of baklava.\n\n"}
{"id": "7474594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7474594", "title": "Atelier", "text": "Atelier\n\nAn atelier () is the private workshop or studio of a professional artist in the fine or decorative arts, where a principal master and a number of assistants, students, and apprentices can work together producing pieces of fine art or visual art released under the master's name or supervision.\n\nThis was the standard vocational practice for European artists from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, and common elsewhere in the world. In medieval Europe such a way of working and form of visual or fine art education was often enforced by local guild regulations, of the painters' Guild of Saint Luke, and those of other guilds for other crafts. Apprentices usually began young, working on simple tasks, and after some years became journeymen, before becoming masters themselves. The system was gradually replaced as the once powerful guilds declined, and the academy became a favored method of training, although many professional artists continued to use students and assistants, some paid by the artist, some paying fees to learn.\n\nIn art, the atelier consists of a master artist, usually a professional painter, sculptor, or from the mid-19th century a fine art photographer, working with a small number of students to train them in visual or fine arts. This very word has also taken on other similar meanings, indicating a place of work and study of the haute couture fashion designer, hair stylist and artists in general. Atelier schools can be found around the world, particularly in North America and Western Europe.\n\nAlthough the methods vary, most painting ateliers train students in the skills and techniques associated with creating some form of representational art, the making of two-dimensional images that appear real to the viewer. They traditionally include sessions for drawing or painting nude art.\n\nSight-Size is a method of drawing and painting an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale. The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface appear to be the same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools—which can include levels, mirrors, plumb bobs, strings, and sticks—the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same dimensions. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It can also be used to draw the exact dimensions for a model in preparation for a painting.\n\nAteliers following the sight-size method generally agree that the practice of careful drawing is the basis of painting, teaching a form of realism based upon careful observations of nature with attention to detail. Using this method, students progress through a series of tasks such as cast drawing, cast painting, drawing and painting from the live model, and still life. Students must complete each task to the instructor's satisfaction before progressing to the next. This system is referred to as \"systematic progression\" or \"systematic teaching and learning\".\n\nAtelier students often begin this progression by drawing plaster casts. These casts are usually faces, hands, or other parts of the human anatomy. Plaster casts provide some of the benefits of live, human models, such as the presence of natural shadows. They also have their own distinct advantages: they remain perfectly still and their white color allows the student to focus on the pure, grayscale tones of shadows.\n\nOne goal for sight-size students is to gain enough skill to transfer an accurate image to the paper or canvas without the aid of a mechanical device. Contemporary realist painter Adrian Gottlieb notes that \"while professional painters pursuing a full-time career will develop an 'eye' that precludes the need for measuring devices and plumb lines (tools necessary during the training period), the observation method itself is not abandoned - instead it becomes second nature. Sight-size can be taught and applied in conjunction with a particular sensitivity to gesture to create life-like imagery; especially when applied to portraiture and figurative works.\"\n\nDarren R. Rousar, former student of Richard Lack and Charles Cecil as well as the author of \"Cast Drawing Using the Sight-Size Approach\", agrees and defines measuring in broad terms. He says that \"a fully trained artist who uses Sight-size might never use a plumb line or even consciously think about literal measuring. He or she will strive toward achieving the same retinal impression in the painting as is seen in nature.\"\n\nArt school owner Charles H. Cecil writes:\n\nArt from ateliers using the sight-size method is often reminiscent of Greek and Roman sculpture from classical antiquity, such as the Apollo Belvedere. Paintings may favor the visual imagery of the Neoclassical art of the mid-18th to 19th century. The sight-size method also lends itself to styles of portraiture in which the artists desires an accurate, natural, true to life or even near photographic image of the sitter as is evident in the work of Bouguereau.\n\nThe comparative measurement method requires proportional accuracy, but allows the artist to vary the size of the image created. This technique broadly encompasses any method of drawing that involves making accurate measurements primarily using the naked eye. In the early training period students may be aided by a pencil, brush or plumb line to make comparisons, but there is no transfer of 1:1 measurements from subject directly to paper. Schools that teach this method include The Water Street Atelier and The Swedish Academy of Realist Art.\n\nIn his essay, \"The Sight-size Method and its Disadvantages\", the painter and instructor Hans-Peter Szameit, of the Swedish Academy of Realist Art, discusses the disadvantages of sight-size, describing it as essentially the making of a mechanically produced image limited to one size, the \"sight size\".\n\nAnother traditional atelier method incorporates the use of illusions that fool the viewer into believing an image is accurate. This method is most often taught in conjunction with advanced compositional theory. Since it is not necessary to copy the subject accurately to achieve a successful illusion, this method allows the artist to experiment with many options while retaining what appears to be a realistic image.\n\nIn one example, the \"Study of a male figure, for Mercury descending\" (c. 1613–1614 (drawn), in \"The Education of Marie de' Medici\"), Rubens has obscured the point where the legs attach to the torso. This is one factor that contributes to the ease in which he is able to successfully experiment with a variety of dramatically different leg placements. At least three sets of feet are visible. The viewer is not disturbed by an illogical attachment if the attachment is not visible and the resulting two-dimensional image is pleasing to the eye. This allows the artist to choose from a great number of very different alternatives, making his selection based on personal preference or aesthetics rather than accuracy. In the referenced exercise it is possible to experiment with numerous manipulations regarding the size and placement of each part of the body while at the same time using a collection of two-dimensional foreshortening illusions to retain the appearance of realism.\n\nIn addition to body parts, artists may rely on the manipulation of many other elements to achieve a successful illusion. These can include: the manipulation of color, value, edge characteristics, overlapping shapes, and a number of different types of paint applications such as glazing and scumbling. Work developed this way would not begin with a drawing, but rather the placement of all relevant elements necessary for the success of the illusions as well as the composition as a whole.\n\nMany of the illusions designed to mimic reality also speed the painting process, allowing artists more time to design and complete complex large-scale works.\n\nIndividual students of this method study a diverse selection of old masters, although many begin their studies with the High Renaissance (1490s–1527), Mannerist (1520–1580), Baroque (1600–1725), and Impressionist (1870s–1880s) painters, including Leonardo da Vinci, Degas, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubens, and Titian. However, because the emphasis is on creativity, it is often the design of the composition and the application and use of materials that is studied with less focus on reproducing a particular style or subject.\n\nStudents of these ateliers will therefore exhibit a wide range of personal styles and increasing amounts of creative experimentation. The result is a group whose art is highly individualized, with each student pursuing their own individual interests. There was great diversity at the atelier of Léon Bonnat (1846–1855). Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as \"a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail.\"\n\nSome of Bonnat's more notable students include: Fred Barnard, Georges Braque, Gustave Caillebotte, Suzor-Coté, Raoul Dufy, Thomas Eakins, Aloysius O'Kelly, John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Marius Vasselon\n\n\n"}

Professional conductors often have personal specifications for a baton based on their own physical demands and the nature of the performance: Sir Henry Wood and Herbert von Karajan are some examples. Historic examples of their construction include one given to the French composer Louis-Antoine Jullien in the mid 1850s prior to his first visit to the United States: it is described as \"a gorgeous baton made of maplewood, richly mounted in gold and set with costly diamonds.\"\n\nBatons have normally varied in length from about though a range of between is more commonly used; Henry Wood once requested the use of a 24-inch baton. When Gaspare Spontini arrived in Dresden in 1844, Wagner had a baton made from a thick ebony staff with ivory knobs at either end. Spontini purportedly held the baton in the center with a fist, using it like a marshall's staff—not for beating time but rather for commanding the opera.\n\nConductors view their gestures as the primary means to communicate musical ideas, whether or not they choose to use batons. Leonard Bernstein is quoted as saying, \"If one [the conductor] uses a baton, the baton itself must be a living thing, charged with a kind of electricity, which makes it an instrument of meaning in its tiniest movement.\"\n\nThe usual way of holding the baton is between the thumb and the first two fingers with the grip in against the palm of the hand. The baton is usually held in the right hand though some left-handed conductors hold it in the left. Young left-handed conductors are, however, sometimes encouraged to learn right-handed conducting.\nSome conductors like Pierre Boulez, Georges Prêtre, Leopold Stokowski and Dimitri Mitropoulos, however, choose not to hold a baton, preferring to conduct only with their hands. This method is common with smaller groups and choral conductors.\nIf the conductor does not use a baton, their hands must do the job with equal clarity, and the gestures must be first and always meaningful in terms of the music. According to Gustav Meier, most conductors use a baton to \"increase the visibility of the beat information\".\n\nBefore the use of the baton, orchestral ensembles were conducted from the harpsichord or the first violin lead. Conductors first began to use violin bows or rolled pieces of paper before the modern baton was introduced.\n\nThe first reported use of the conducting staff in a performance dates back to 709 BC, during which the leader, \"Pherekydes of Patrae, giver of rhythm\" had,\n\n...stationed himself in the centre and had placed himself on a high seat, waving a golden staff, and the players on the flute and cythara were...placed in a circle around him...now when Pherekydes with his golden staff gave the signal, all the art-experienced men began in one and the same time...\n\nOn 8 January 1687, Jean-Baptiste Lully was conducting a \"Te Deum\" to celebrate Louis XIV of France's recent recovery from illness. As was the common practice, he was beating time by banging a long staff (a precursor to the baton; the French word \"bâton\" actually meaning \"staff\") against the floor when he struck his toe, creating an abscess. The wound turned gangrenous, but Lully refused to have his toe amputated and the infection spread, resulting in his death on 22 March.\n\nDifferent eyewitnesses to the premiere performance of Joseph Haydn's Creation in April of 1798 indicate that Haydn used a baton to conduct with his hands. Said Princess Eleanor von Liechtenstein, \"Hayden[sic] gave the tempo with his two hands;\" and wrote a Swedish relative of Franz Berwald, \"on a higher level stood Haydn himself with his baton.\"\n\nThe baton began to gain in popularity between 1820 and 1840. The first batons were narrow and conical wooden wands that had an engraving of three rings near the bottom that indicated the handle. The Hallé Orchestra reported that Daniel Turk used a baton in 1810, with motions so exuberant that he occasionally hit the chandelier above his head and showered himself with glass.\n\nLouis Spohr claimed to have introduced the baton to England on 10 April 1820, while conducting his second symphony with the Philharmonic Society in London. Witnesses noted that the conductor \"sits there and turns over the leaves of the score but after all, he cannot, without ... his baton, lead on his musical army\". It is more likely that he used his baton in rehearsal than in concert. It was 1825 when George Smart reported that he sometimes 'beat time in front with a short stick'.\n\nWhen Felix Mendelssohn returned to London in 1832, despite objections from violin leaders, he was encouraged to go on with his baton. Despite the initial disagreement, the baton was in regular use at the Philharmonic a year later.\n\nIn the early 1940s, while big band jazz music was on the rise, the use of a conductor became paramount to the success of the ensemble. To accommodate this, these conductors started using specialized \"jazz batons.\" These specialized batons were slightly shorter than standard batons, ranging from 6 to 9 inches in length. Several famous jazz conductors that used these specific batons include Quincy Jones, Gunther Schuller and Richard Rogers. Although they are rarely used today, many accomplished jazz conductors use them during ballads.\n"}

The degree of rareness and the amount of charring on the outside may vary according to taste. The term \"Pittsburgh rare\" is used in some parts of the American midwest and eastern seaboard, but similar methods of sear cooking are known by different terms elsewhere, including Chicago-style rare and, in Pittsburgh itself, black and bleu. One story says that a local slaughterhouse during the depression was looking to make extra money and opened a restaurant in the front. Wealthy socialites could choose their cut of meat off of a live cow and wait while it was slaughtered. The steak would then be seared to kill bacteria and served at the cow's body temperature, thus creating \"Pittsburgh Rare\".\n\nThe term started in the various steel mills in and around Pittsburgh. The mill workers needed high calorie food for the heavy work and had only 30 minutes for lunch. The blast furnaces were heated to over . They would throw a steak on the side of the blast furnace which was sterile due to the high heat, leave it for a few moments, and then turn it. The steak was seared but raw inside.\n\nOne story relates that the method originated as an explanation for an accidental charring of a steak at a Pittsburgh restaurant, with the cook explaining that this was \"Pittsburgh style\".\n\nIt has been said that the \"original\" method of preparation was by searing the meat with a welding torch. Whether this is true is unknown. Another method, related by a staff member at a Pittsburgh branch of Ruth's Chris Steak House, originates from the region's steel mills and the practice of workers cooking a steak on a cooling piece of steel. The temperature of the steel would be such that it would be impossible to do more than char the outside of the steak while keeping anything worth eating. One popular version of this myth is that steel workers would bring raw steaks to work and on their lunch break throw them against the huge searing-hot molten steel \"tubs\". The steak would burn almost immediately then fall off, then they'd other side of the steak up against the tub to finish it. Whether any of these origins is genuine or just a play on Pittsburgh's industrial image is debatable.\n\nMany restaurant guests use the term Pittsburgh to describe a steak that is extra charred on the outside, no matter what internal temperature is desired.\n\n"}

S. army bases, in the Uijeongbu, Pyeongtaek, and Munsan areas made use of surplus foods from army bases, commonly processed meat products, collectively known as \"budae-gogi\" (; \"army base meat\"), such as ham, hot dogs, and Spam, along with canned baked beans. It is said that \"budae-jjigae\" begun as a buttery stir-fried snack made of sausages, ham, cabbages and onions to accompany \"makgeolli\" (rice wine), but later on, anchovy broth flavored with gochujang and kimchi was added to create the stew that is enjoyed today. The stew was also referred to as \"Jonseun-tang\" (; \"Johnson soup\"), Johnson being United States President Lyndon B. Johnson, who is said to have raved about the taste of the dish amid his visit to Korea. The ingredients were often scrounged or smuggled through a black market, as American products were not legally accessible to Koreans.\n\n\"Budae-jjigae\" is still popular in South Korea. Common ingredients now include: Vienna sausage, bacon, tofu, pork, ground beef, instant noodles, macaroni, \"tteok\" (rice cake), American cheese, mozzarella, water-dropworts, scallions, chili peppers, garlic, mushrooms and other vegetables in season. The city of Uijeongbu, which is bordered by Seoul to the south and has many army bases, is famous for its \"budae-jjigae\". In the late 20th century, the city of Uijeongbu stipulated that the dish be referred to as \"Uijeongbu-jjigae\" to remove the military or war-time connotation in the name, though not many restaurants follow this guideline. Some restaurants have begun calling their product \"Uijeongbu-budae-jjigae\". There is also what locals refer to as \"Uijeongbu \"Budae-jjigae\" Street\" where there is a high concentration of \"budae-jjigae\" restaurants.\n\n"}

It is frequently used in the context of social problems.\n\nIn Quranic Arabic, \"ṣulḥ\" is used as a term signifying an agreement or settlement over a property dispute and retains this sense in later Islamic legal usage. In Bedouin customary law, it can signify a settlement of a tribal feud and in modern Arabic usage, it is applied to treaties, such as \"ṣulḥ Versailles\" (the Treaty of Versailles). In general, it reflects a sense of resolution of conflict through negotiation. The two parties select respected individuals to mediate the conflict, a truce (\"hudna\") is declared, a settlement is reached that maintains the honor and status of both parties, and a public ritual takes place. Particularly important is the fact that the practice affirms bonds between groups and not just individuals. It averts a cycle of revenge.\n\n\"Ṣulḥ\", in its sense of conflict mediation, is still common in rural areas where governmental systems of justice have little force.\n\nIn the early days of the Islamic Empire, \"ṣulḥ\", in the sense of \"treaty\" or \"armistice,\" typically meant that a region had \"surrendered on terms\" or similarly during the Ottoman retreat it preceded a region's independence. Typically, it signified an area that was ruled and administered by its local political structure but acknowledged itself as a subject through the payment of tribute.\n\nIn the Muslim world view on divisions of the world the region called the \"Dār al-‘Ahd\" (, \"house of truce\") or \"Dār aṣ-Ṣulḥ\" (, \"house of treaty\") or \"Dār al-Hudna\" (, \"house of calm\") was seen as an intermediate to \"Dār al-Islām\" (, \"house/abode of Islam\"), or \"Dār as-Salām\" (, \"house/abode of Peace\"), and \"Dār al-Ḥarb\" (, \"house of war\").\n\n\"Dār aṣ-Ṣulḥ\", was then seen as non-Muslim territory that had concluded an armistice with Muslims, and had agreed to protect Muslims and their clients and interests within its borders. Often this implied a tributary situation, however modern writings also include friendly countries in \"Dār aṣ-Ṣulḥ\". By no means was this particular division, however, recognized by all Muslim jurists, and due to historical changes these concepts have little significance today.\n\n"}

{"id": "7567222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7567222", "title": "Mizrah", "text": "Mizrah\n\nMizrah () is the Hebrew word for \"east\" and the direction that Jews in the Diaspora west of Israel face during prayer. Practically speaking, Jews would face the city of Jerusalem when praying, and those north, east, or south of Jerusalem face south, west, and north respectively.\n\nIn European and Mediterranean communities west of the Holy Land, the word \"mizrach\" also refers to the wall of the synagogue that faces east, where seats are reserved for the rabbi and other dignitaries. In addition, \"mizrach\" refers to an ornamental wall plaque used to indicate the direction of prayer in Jewish homes.\n\nThe Talmud states that a Jew praying in the Diaspora, shall direct himself toward the Land of Israel; in Israel, toward Jerusalem; in Jerusalem, toward the Temple; and in the Temple, toward the Holy of Holies. The same rule is found in the Mishnah; however, it is prescribed for individual prayers only rather than for congregational prayers at a synagogue. Thus, if a man is east of the Temple, he should turn westward; if in the west, eastward; in the south, northward; and if in the north, southward.\n\nThe custom is based on the prayer of Solomon (I Kings 8:33, 44, 48; II Chron. 6:34). Another passage supporting this rule is found in the Book of Daniel, which relates that in the upper chamber of the house, where Daniel prayed three times a day, the windows were opened toward Jerusalem (Dan. 6:10).\n\nThe Tosefta demands that the entrance to the synagogue should be on the eastern side with the congregation facing west. The requirement is probably based on the orientation of the tent of meeting, which had its gates on the eastern side (Num. 2:2–3; 3:38), or Solomon's Temple, the portals of which were to the east (Ezek. 43:1–4). Maimonides attempted to reconcile the Tosefta's provision with the requirement to pray toward Jerusalem by stating that the doors of the synagogue should face east, while the Ark should be placed \"in the direction in which people pray in that city,\" i.e., toward Jerusalem. The Shulkhan Arukh records the same rule, but it also recommends that one turn toward the southeast instead of east to avoid the semblance of worshiping the sun.\n\nIf a person is unable to ascertain the cardinal points, he should direct his heart toward Jerusalem.\n\nExcavations of ancient synagogues show that their design generally conformed with the Talmudic and traditional rule on prayer direction. The synagogues excavated west of Eretz Israel in Miletus, Priene, and Aegina all show an eastern orientation. Josephus, in his work \"Against Apion\", recorded that the same was the case for Egyptian synagogues. Synagogues north of Jerusalem and west of the Jordan River, as in Bet Alfa, Capernaum, Hammath, and Khorazin, all face southward, whereas houses of worship east of the Jordan all face west. In the south, the synagogue excavated at Masada faces northwest to Jerusalem. The Tosefta's regulation that the entrance to the synagogue should be on the eastern side, while the orientation of the building should be toward the west was followed only in the synagogue in Irbid.\n\nInitially, the \"mizrah\" wall in synagogues was on the side of the entrance. However, the remains of the Dura-Europos synagogue on the Euphrates reveal that by the 3rd century C.E. the doors were on the eastern side and the opposite wall, in which a special niche had been made to place the scrolls during worship, faced Jerusalem. In Eretz Israel, the wall facing the Temple site was changed from the side of the entrance to the side of the Ark in the 5th or 6th century. This change is found in synagogues at Naaran, near Jericho, and Beit Alfa. Worshipers came through the portals and immediately faced both the scrolls and Jerusalem.\n\nIt is customary in traditional Jewish homes to mark the wall in the direction of \"mizrah\" to facilitate proper prayer. For this purpose, people use artistic wall plaques inscribed with the word \"mizrah\" and scriptural passages like \"From the rising (\"mi-mizrah\") of the sun unto the going down thereof, the Lord's name is to be praised\" (Ps. 113:3), kabbalistic inscriptions, or pictures of holy places. These plaques are generally placed in rooms in which people pray, such as the living room or bedrooms.\n\nLike the Jews, Muslims used Jerusalem as their \"Qiblah\" (, Direction of Prayer), before it was permanently changed to Mecca.\n\n\n"}

In Elizabethan times, \"collops\" came to refer specifically to slices of bacon. Shrove Monday, also known as Collop Monday, was traditionally the last day to cook and eat meat before Ash Wednesday, which was a day of fasting and abstinence from meat, and part of pre-Lenten activities. A traditional breakfast dish was collops of bacon topped with a fried egg. At Christ's Hospital, which was founded before the reign of Elizabeth the First, the word collops was used on the menu to mean stewed minced beef.\n\nScotch collops are a traditional Scottish dish. It can be created using either thin slices or minced meat of either beef, lamb or venison. This is combined with onion, salt, pepper and suet, then stewed, baked or roasted with optional flavourings according to the meat used. It is traditionally served garnished with thin toast and mashed potato. It is referred to as a meal in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, \"Kidnapped\".\n\nLamb collops were included on the breakfast menu for first class passengers of the Titanic.\n\nThe derivation is obscure; the OED cites that it may be related to the old Swedish word \"kollops\" (equivalent to the modern: \"kalops),\" but also suggests a German origin (\"klops\"). The Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman derives the modern Swedish \"kalops\" from the English \"collops\", which in turn is said to originate from Swedish word \"colhoppe\" (ember-hops, from how the thin sliced strips of dried salted leg of mutton danced on the glowing hot skillet) that was well established in the Swedish language in the 15th century.\n\n"}

The most standard definition is \"stranger\". However, the word, itself, can be interpreted to mean different things based upon context, author and period of writing/speaking, signifying such divergent concepts as \"enemy\" or \"stranger\", a particular hostile interpretation, all the way to \"guest friend\"' one of the most hallowed concepts in the cultural rules of Greek hospitality. \n\n\"Xenos\" can be translated both to foreigner (in the sense of a person from another Greek state) and to a foreigner or traveler brought into a relationship of long distance friendship. \"Xenos\" can also be used simply to assert that someone is not a member of your community, that is simply foreigner and with no implication of reciprocity or relationship. \"Xenos\" generally refers to the variety of what a particular individual can be, specifically guest, host, stranger, friend, and, as previously mentioned, foreigner.\n\nThe ambiguity of the meaning of \"xenos\" is not a modern misunderstanding, but was, in fact, present in ancient Greece. Sophocles uses the vagueness of the word \"xenos\" in his tragedy \"Philoctetes\", with Neoptolemus using the word exclusively for Philoctetes to indicate the uncertain relationship between the two characters. \"Xenos\" can be used to refer to guest-friends whose relationship is constructed under the ritual of \"xenia\" (\"guest-friendship\"). In this usage it is commonly translated as \"guest-friend\" to distinguish it from the Greek word \"philos\", which was used to refer to local friends and to relatives not strictly bound by \"xenia\". The Greeks used this ambiguity because they thought strangers could be gods or goddesses in disguise, so they were always kind and respectful to strangers, because if it was a god, they could be blessed by that god or goddess.\n\nThe word is featured prominently in the 2002 film \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\". Gus Portokalos (Michael Constantine) uses it to describe anybody who is non-Greek, especially the family of his daughter Toula's (Nia Vardalos) fiancée Ian Miller (John Corbett). The name of the titular character of the television show derives from the word.\n\n"}

It was subsequently eclipsed until brought back into English as isonomy (\"equality of law\").\n\nMogens Herman Hansen has argued that, although often translated as \"equality of law,\" \"isonomia\" was in fact something else. Along with \"isonomia\", the Athenians used several terms for equality all compounds beginning with \"iso-\": \"isegoria\" (equal right to address the political assemblies), \"isopsephos polis\" (one man one vote) and \"isokratia\" (equality of power).\n\nWhen Herodotus invents a debate among the Persians over what sort of government they should have, he has Otanes speak in favor of \"isonomia\" when, based on his description of it, we might expect him to call the form of government he favors \"democracy.\"\n\nThe rule of the people has the fairest name of all, equality (\"isonomia\"), and does none of the things that a monarch does. The lot determines offices, power is held accountable, and deliberation is conducted in public.\n\nThucydides used \"isonomia\" as an alternative to dynastic oligarchy and moderate aristocracy. In time the word ceased to refer to a particular political regime; Plato uses it to refer to simply equal rights and Aristotle does not use the word at all.\n\nAccording to economist and political theorist Friedrich Hayek, \"isonomia\" was championed by the Roman Cicero and \"rediscovered\" in the eleventh century AD by the law students of Bologna who he says are credited with founding much of the Western legal tradition.\n\n\"Isonomia\" was imported into England at the end of the sixteenth century as a word meaning \"equality of laws to all manner of persons\". Soon after, it was used by the translator of Livy in the form \"Isonomy\" (although not a direct translation of \"isonomia\") to describe a state of equal laws for all and responsibility of the magistrates. During the seventeenth century it was gradually replaced by the phrases \"equality before the law\", \"rule of law\" and \"government of law\".\n\nPolitical theorist Hannah Arendt argued that isonomy was equated with political freedom at least from the time of Herodotus. The word essentially denoted a state of no-rule, in which there was no distinction between rulers and ruled. It was \"the equality of those who form a body of peers.\" Isonomy was unique among the forms of government in the ancient lexicon in that it lacked the suffixes \"-archy\" and \"-cracy\" which denote a notion of rule in words like \"monarchy\" and \"democracy.\" Arendt goes on to argue that the Greek \"polis\" was therefore conceived not as a democracy but as an isonomy. \"Democracy\" was the term used by opponents of isonomy who claimed that \"what you say is 'no-rule' is in fact only another kind of rulership...rule by the \"demos\",\" or majority.\n\nThe public administration theorist, Alberto Guerreiro Ramos, reserved for isonomy a central role in his model of human organization. He was particularly concerned with distinguishing the space of the isonomy from that of the economy. Following Arendt, Guerreiro Ramos argued that individuals should have the opportunity to engage with others in settings that are unaffected by economizing considerations. The isonomy constitutes such a setting; its function is to \"enhance the good life of the whole.\"\n\nAncient Greek philosophy linked to \"isonomía\" with \"isegoría\" (prior equality in determining principles of law) and \"isocratía\" (equality in subsequent governance or application of law)\n\n"}

It was made by James Keiller in Dundee, Scotland, later creating James Keiller & Son, a brand name which became iconic in the 18th and 19th centuries, and has been sold several times.\n\nIn the 18th century, James Keiller on speculation bought a Spanish ship's cargo that included Seville oranges when the ship sought refuge from a raging storm. The ship had started its journey in Seville but the delay caused by the storm had made the oranges less fresh than they ought to have been. The bargain gave Keiller's wife, Janet, the opportunity to manufacture a large quantity of marmalade. She boiled the bitter oranges with sugar which resulted in the creation of orange marmalade. \n\nThe true story is that Janet Keiller did \"not\" invent marmalade. She modified it. In the 1760s Keiller ran a small confectionery shop producing jams in Seagate, Dundee. She modified a quince-based recipe, marmalato, by shifting to seville oranges, with their bitter rinds, to create shredded peel or \"chip\" marmalade. The peel was thought to aid digestion, although the pith and much of the fiber was discarded.\n\nJames and Janet Keiller were \"not\" a couple, but rather son and mother. James Keiller was single at the time that this story takes place. The shipload was probably no more than some boxes, particularly of Seville oranges, which were used medicinally and in a few recipes but not really a fruit consumed fresh. The name \"marmalade\" originates from the Portuguese word \"marmelo\" or quince, the fruit which made up the preserve with thin bits of peel. The Keiller contribution was to add the bits of the peel to the marmalade which are the signature of Seville orange marmalades to this day. \n\nThe Keillers adapted an existing recipe for mass manufacture, which had been made with quince by adding the characteristic rind suspended in the preserve.\n\nThe first commercial brand of marmalade, along with the world's first marmalade plant, was founded in 1797. In 1828, the company became \"James Keiller and Son\", when James junior joined the business In 1859 the company set up a factory in Guernsey in order to avoid the sugar tax charged on the mainland and with a view to eventually expanding business in the south of England. In 1880 the company opened a factory at Tay Wharf, Silvertown in London. By the late 19th century the marmalade was shipping as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India and China.\n\nThe 19th century expansions were done under the directorship of John Mitchell Keiller (1851-1899).\n\nIt is believed that James Keiller and Son was also the first to produce Dundee cake commercially and to give it the distinctive name. By the 1920s, after the firm had been acquired by Crosse & Blackwell, the company had become a producer of a wide range of confectionery, preserves and cakes. After this acquisition in 1920, Keiller was sold again several times before becoming part of another company of Scottish origin, Robertson's. It is now produced by Hain Celestial Group for export only.\n\nOne of Janet Keiller's great-great-great grandsons was Alexander Keiller, the noted archaeologist, and one of her great-great-great-great grandsons is the British television presenter Monty Don.\n\nJames and Janet Keiller are buried in the Howff Cemetery in central Dundee. The grave lies very close to the south-west corner.\n"}

Lisa claims the moral of the story is that taking revenge makes a person as bad as those who hurt them; Homer claims that the moral is for someone to never put down their weapon, at which point he draws a baseball bat and resumes his pursuit of revenge.\n\nBart recounts \"Bartman's 'origin story'\", based on Batman's origin as revealed in the film \"Batman Begins\".\n\nAfter leaving the Gotham City Opera House, Homer and Marge, parodying Thomas and Martha Wayne respectively, are killed by Snake Jailbird, parodying Joe Chill, in a dark alley. For his last words, Homer pleads Bart, who is parodying Bruce Wayne, to avenge him \"in flamboyant, impractical fashion\". Bart does as his father says and swears revenge on Snake, giving birth to his superhero alter ego, Bartman. The alter ego is achieved with the help of his grandfather, who had a past alter ego as the Crimson Cockatoo; Bart's grandfather suggested that Bart become The Crimson Cockaboy. Bartman flies around Gotham City, defeating enemies in his way for justice. The villains' Springfield identities are Otto Mann (The Toker), Ned Flanders (The Diddler), Hans Moleman (Mr. Mole), Patty and Selma Bouvier (Sugar and Spice), and Lenny (Poison Lenny), who was not actually a villain, but a transvestite. When Serpent, Snake's alter ego, attempts to steal the \"Stealable Jewels of the Orient\" from the Gotham Natural History Museum, Bartman arrives, retrieves the Jewels, and kills Serpent by impaling him on the fangs of a snake statue. Afterwards, a reporter, played by Lisa parodying Vicki Vale, reminds Bartman that the Serpent's death won't bring his parents back. Bartman agrees that she has a point, but adds that he feels better since he finally avenged the death of his parents, and has now gained \"zillions of dollars\" and freedom from said parents.\n\nIn conclusion, Bart says that revenge can be satisfying and thus goes against the wishes of Marge and Lisa. However, during the story, Homer is seen to have made amends with the Rich Texan after hearing that they are both from Connecticut.\n\nAt the end, the credits read \"Dedicated to all who died in the \"Star Wars\" films\". The list includes Darth Vader, Darth Maul (whose death was later retconned by the Clone Wars series), Greedo, Uncle Owen, Storm Trooper #5, Jango Fett, General Grievous (Droid), Storm Trooper #22, Dak, Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, Yoda, \"Whoever Jimmy Smits Played\", Hutt, Jabba the, Sy Snoodles, \"Unfortunately, not Jar-Jar Binks,\" and \"everyone on both Death Stars when they blew up\". There are errors in the list, including the names of Jar Jar Binks and Sy Snootles being spelled incorrectly. Also, Sy Snootles was not shown to die in \"Return of the Jedi\".\n\nOn TV.com, the episode has a user rating of 8.2 based on 190 votes.\n\nDan Iverson of IGN gave the episode a rating of 7.7, writing \"While there was some really funny material in the episode, \"Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times\" was still under par for The Simpsons. \"The Count of Monte Fatso\" showed the fact that the writers can still do a silly parody well, but the other two stories were rather mediocre, relying on gags and humorous visuals to make the segments passable. The trilogy style of episodes continues to be very entertaining, and even though this particular episode wasn't astounding, we will still anticipate the next time that the show gives us parody stories with our favorite television family.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "7700069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700069", "title": "Swedish ballad tradition", "text": "Swedish ballad tradition\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition is the tradition of Swedish poetic singer-songwriters. This \"visa\" tradition should not be confused with traditional \"medieval\" Swedish ballads (\"medeltida ballader\"), which are representative of a typical tradition of Scandinavian ballads.\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition today is both a respected art form and an important basis of the popular Swedish (and Scandinavian) sing-along tradition. The song type is typically known as \"visa\" in Swedish and troubadours in the genre are called \"vissångare\". In context, the Swedish word \"ballad\" is a subtype of \"visa\" that tells a story in many verses, similar to the medieval ballads, as opposed to for instance lyrical songs about the beauty of nature. The Swedish ballads can be performed to a big orchestra but are often sung to fairly simple accompaniment on guitar, or other instruments such as piano or accordion.\n\nThe genre started with Carl Michael Bellman in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, poetic songwriting fell into decline in favour of academic student choirs, until it was revived in the 1890s by Sven Scholander. Poets increasingly continued the tradition of having their poetry put to music to give it a wider audience. In the early 1900s, a lot of poetry of the 90s poets Gustaf Fröding and Erik Axel Karlfeldt had been put to music, and the popularity of those poets largely depended on the troubadours.\n\nBirger Sjöberg (1885–1929) was one of the early popular troubadours. Sjöberg published the poetry collection \"Frida's Book\" (\"Fridas bok\", 1922), a light and humorous story of the young \"Frida\". In 1926, he reinvented himself with \"Kriser och kransar\" (\"Crises and garlands\"), a much darker collection of poetry. It is regarded as the foremost collection of Swedish poetry of the 1920s.\nOne of the most renowned Swedish troubadours of the 20th century was Evert Taube (1890–1976). He established himself as a performing artist in 1920 and toured Sweden for about three decades. He is best known for songs about sailors, ballads about Argentina, and songs about the Swedish countryside.\n\nA poet who is known for songs is Nils Ferlin (1898–1961) who published six collection of poetry between 1930 and 1957. Ferlin melancholic but with a stinging irony, and very rhythmical which made them easy for friends and colleagues to put music to. The titles of some of the poems already from the start referred to them being sung as songs, such as \"En valsmelodi\" (which translates as \"A waltz tune\"), and the title of his first collection of poems, \"En döddansares visor\".\n\nOther well-known singer-songwriters in the Swedish ballad tradition after Evert Taube were Olle Adolphson (1934–2004) and Cornelis Vreeswijk (1937–1987). Vreeswijk's songs were initially leftist protest songs where he took upon himself to speak for the weaker men of society. After his death, Vreeswijk also gained appreciation for his poetic qualities.\n\nPerhaps the best-known contemporary troubadour is Lars Winnerbäck, whose folk-rock ballads, often infused with a poetic quality, mix a Christian socialist political message with a typically Swedish sensitivity to nature in the spirit of Vreeswijk, making him one of Sweden's most popular currently active musicians.\n\nThe Swedish ballad tradition has close similarities to the ballad tradition (also known as \"vise\") in Norway, with Alf Prøysen as an early and prominent, yet distinct, representative. The Swedish ballad tradition has also greatly inspired the modern ballad tradition in Norway, that started in the 1960s as a cultural movement known as \"visebølgen\" (\"the ballad wave\"). Some of its prominent representatives are Ole Paus, Lillebjørn Nilsen and Finn Kalvik.\n\n"}

Traditionally served in the morning with salt, onion and chili. It is consumed in Bangladesh and the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Kishanganj, Bihar. It is a popular dish on the day of Pohela Boishakh or Bengali new year. It has been described in documents from 17th century. Panta bhat has more micronutrients than fresh rice. It is traditionally considered as beneficial in feverish conditions. Pakhala, a similar dish, is popular in Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. It is consumed in East and South East Asia as well. In China, it is known as Jiuniang and eaten mostly in the Sinchuan and Yunnan regions.\n\nAnthropologist Tapan Kumar Sanyal argues that proto-Australoid people of South Asia resorted the panta bhat because they cooked once a day, in the evening. During the Mughal Era, members of socio-cultural organizations performed open air concerts, the audience listening to the concert and eating traditional food, particularly \"panta bhat\". Friar Sebastian Manrique reported from his visit of Bengal in 17th century that the people of all communities, according to Manrique, were contented then with the daily meal of rice, often \"panta bhat\", salt and green vegetable (\"shak\"). The better-off elements of the society consumed ghee, butter, milk and various lacteous preparations and sweetmeats.\n\nRice researcher Mahabub Hossain of International Rice Research Institute explains that in the past, people engaged in farm work preferred bold and brown rice which is more suited for watered rice, and also provides more nutrition. But, as more people shifted to urban centers the demand for farm work, brown rice and watered rice decreased. In these times of polished rice, the popularity of rice varieties like Lal Swarna and White Swarna is often driven by their suitability for panta bhat.\n\nThere are many variations of the dish though all are made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then \"phaen\" or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is added in a way that about an inch of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Panta bhat retains its taste for 2/3 days. The fluid portion is called amani or torani, and may be specially prepared. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination.\n\nThe soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Panta bhat is often served with fried fish or vegetable curry or flattened rice (\"chira\"), dried cane or palm molasses (jaggery or \"gurh\") and milk curd (\"doi\"). Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added. Panta bhat or poita bhat is often garnished with mustard oil, onion, chilli, pickle, and served with shutki mach (dried fish), machher jhol (fish curry), especially shorshe Ilish (ilish cooked with mustard seeds), \"aloo bhorta\" or \"aloo pitika\" (mashed potato), begun bhorta (mashed brinjal) and other \"bhorta\" or \"pitika\" (mashed food).\n\nA similar dish consumed in the Indian states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh is known as Pakhala (also pakhal], pokhalo or pakhal bhat). It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process. Pazhedhu saadham, meaning \"old rice\", of Tamil Nadu is another variation of the dish.\n\nPanta bhat is especially popular in rural areas, generally served with salt, raw onion and green chili. It is usually served as breakfast, though noon or evening consumption is not uncommon. Panta bhat and other low nutrition food are consumed as fillers between meals. Panta bhat is one of the \"cool dishes\" popular in Bengal, meaning it helps keep cool during the summer. This cold and wet food, is suitable for summer mornings, but in winter dry foods, such as \"chira\" (flattened rice) and \"muri\" (puffed rice) are more preferred.\n\nIn Bangladesh, as well West Bengal, it is a part of the Pohela Boishakh (Bengali new year festival) festivities. On that day it is consumed as breakfast by urban people. Panta is also served at high-end eateries in Bangladesh and West Bengal on the day. Food-stalls maintained mostly by student groups on fair-grounds also serve panta-ilish. Panta bhat on Pohela Boishakh is often served with fried hilsha (\"ilish\"), and students of Pabna Science and Technology University (PUST) assaulted their student counselor for not providing panta-ilish in the Pohela Boishakh of 2014. But, the practice takes a toll on the hilsha population during the breeding season. Since 2016, Bangladesh government banned hilsha fishing and selling in the times of Pohela Boishakh, ministers started urging people to have panta without \"ilish\" and social media baceme rife with calls for panta without \"ilish\".\n\nAmong Hindu Bengalis, it is consumed during the Ranna Puja (Bengali cooking festival). During Ranna Puja, panta bhat is offered to Manasa the snake goddess along with fried vegetables, yellow pigeon peas cooked with elephant apples, curried ash gourd and fried Hilsa. On the Vijayadashami day of Durga Puja, panta bhat is offered to Durga along with soup of grass pea, fried taro leaves, machher jhol of blue perch and chutney of elephant apple for Sabarna Roy Choudhury Atchala Durga in Kolkata. In Assam, offering \"Dudh Panta\" (milk with stale water-soaked rice) is a part of the marital ritual. In Northeast India, there is a belief that taking \"painta\" or \"panta bhat\" gives the strength of a tiger. Panta bhat is also popular among slum-dwellers of Dhaka because it can be easily eaten only with salt or with an onion or a fried or green chili, without any other requirement.\n\nMost restaurants on NH34, which runs through Krishnanagar, Nadia, serve panta bhat in summer along with kasundi, mustard oil, kaffir lime, green chili, sliced onion, aloo chokha, fried red chili, Poppy seed balls, aloo jhuri bhaja, mango chutney, sour curd, and sweet paan. Nabanno Hyderabad, a Bengali-owned restaurant in Kukatpally, Hyderabad, serve panta bhat all the year round.\n\nThere are many folk rhymes and proverbs about panta bhat: \"shashuri nai nonod nai kar ba kori dar\"/\"agey khai panta bhat sheshe lepi ghar\" (lit. \"no mother-in-law, no sister-in-law, whom do I fear/ shall eat watered rice first then clean the room\"), \"maga bhat tay basi ar panta\"(lit. \"got rice begging, ask not whether stale or watered\"), \"ki katha bolbo sai/panta bhate tak dai\" (lit. \"what do I say, sour curd on watered rice), \"panta bhate noon jote na/begun poday ghee\" (lit. \"no salt in watered rice/ghee in roasted brinjal\"), \"noon ante panta phuray\" (lit. \"when salt arrives, the panta is finished\"), \"mude mai radhe na/tapta ar panta\" (lit. \"mother does not cook/so why ask hot or cold\") and \"bandir kame yash nai/panta bhate kash nai\" (lit. \"no merit in a maid's work/no fun in watered rice\").\n\nIn a study conducted by agricultural biotechnology department of the Assam Agricultural University it was concluded that cooked rice had an element that prevented the availability of minerals like iron, potassium, sodium and calcium in high quantities, and the breakdown of the nutritional inhibitor by the lactic acid bacteria increased the mineral content manifolds. According to Madhumita Barooah, one of the researchers, \"About 100 gm of cooked rice has only 3.4 mg of iron, while for the same quantity of rice fermented for 12 hours, the iron content went up to 73.91 mg. Likewise, sodium, which was 475 mg came down to 303 mg, potassium went up to 839 mg and calcium went up from 21 mg per 100 gm of cooked rice to 850 mg, after 12 hours of fermentation of the same quantity of rice.\" According to another study (ILSI 1998), fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic acid hydrolysis, and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B.\n\nPanta bhat has some remedial use. It is considered as a \"cold food\" by Ayurveda traditions, while boiled rice is neutral. Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever. Panta bhat also contains a small amount of alcohol as a result of fermentation. When the conditions of preparing \"panta bhat\" — keeping rice soaked overnight in water — were simulated in the laboratory, the rice was found to be inoculated with veratridine, a steroid-derived alkaloid.\n\nDespite its nutritional and remedial values, panta bhat is often contaminated, with almost 90% of the samples containing fecal coliforms with a median count of 3.9 log cfu/ml. The contamination was more in the rainy season. Numbers of fecal coliforms increased 10-fold when there was a delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption; 90% of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation. Contamination increased during the rainy season. A ten-fold increase in contamination was observed between 4 hours of soaking and 16 hours of soaking. In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient, though boiled rice and rice-water are often prescribed as diarrheal treatment.\n\n"}
{"id": "7725386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725386", "title": "Backdraft (drink)", "text": "Backdraft (drink)\n\nThe Backdraft is a cocktail that is noted for its elaborate preparation and potency. Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact.\n\nThe procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink.\n\nA classic Backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter. The mixture is set alight, and after a few seconds, extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand, although often a coaster or saucer is used instead. Once the flame is out, a straw is inserted, keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors.\n\nBoth the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw.\n\nDrambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite, if not impossible, so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n\nWhen a gas is heated, its volume increases. It will displace cooler gases as it expands. If this is done in a partially enclosed space, and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas, when the heat is taken away, the gases cool and as they do, the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease. Therefore, most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense. As the gas cools, it decreases in volume, and the pressure drops. Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer, the dense, cold air is replaced with less dense, warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it. As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted, the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out, removing the heat source. The alcohol-laden warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference. The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside (as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect) as it begins to equalise the pressure difference. Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass, sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass. At some point an equilibrium will occur, where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside, and this will hold the liquid inside the glass. Sometimes, when a good seal is made, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted, the saucer will remain stuck to its underside.\n\nWhen the pint glass is removed, ice is immediately added, thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour, creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails. By covering the glass with the hand, this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation, usually through a straw.\n\n"}

In practice, however, Labrador tea and fruit teas, such as magnolia berry tea and goji berry tea, were more widely used in the Samhan Era instead.\n\nIt is a widely held belief that the systematic planting of tea bushes began with the introduction of Chinese tea culture by Buddhist monks some centuries later. Some of the earliest Buddhist temples in Korea, such as Bulgapsa, Bulhoesa, and Hwaeomsa, claim to be the birthplace of Korean tea culture. The import of Chinese tea products started during the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla (631‒647), when two types of tea bricks, \"jeoncha\" () and \"dancha\" (), were imported from the Tang Empire. In 765, a Buddhist monk is said to have presented an offering of the tea to King Gyeongdeok and the Buddha. \"Camellia sinensis\" tea plants spread throughout the country in 828, when King Heungdeok received seeds from the Tang Empire and sent them to be planted on the Jirisan mountain. Tea was usually offered to the Buddha, as well as to the spirits of deceased ancestors.\n\nTea culture continued to prosper during the Goryeo Dynasty. Tea offering was a part of the biggest national ceremonies, such as Yeondeunghoe and Palgwanhoe, and tea towns were formed around temples. During the reign of King Myeongjong (1131‒1202), Seon-Buddhist manners of ceremony prevailed. Jeong Mongju and other scholars enjoyed tea poetry, \"dasi\" (), and tea meetings, \"dahoe\" (). The state of \"daseonilchi\" (; \"tea and \"seon\" in accord\") was eulogized.\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), Korean tea culture underwent secularization . The royal family and aristocracy used tea for simple rites, a practice referred to as \"darye\" (, \"tea rite\"), which is often translated as \"etiquette for tea\". Towards the end of the Joseon Dynasty, commoners adopted the practice of using tea for ancestral rites. The word \"charye\" (, \"tea rite\"), cognate to \"darye\", now refers to \"jesa\" (ancestral rite). In the past, the two terms were synonymous, as ancestral rites often involved offerings of tea to the ancestors. Wedding ceremonies also included tea offerings. The practice of packing tea into small cakes, which lost popularity in China during the 14th century, continued in Korea until the 19th century.\n\nIn 1895, King Gojong of the Korean Empire used coffee for the first time. In 1896, grocery stores began to have tea rooms as annexes, and the first modern tea house was established in 1924.\n\nAlthough tea from the \"Camellia sinensis\" plant is not as popular as coffee in South Korea - with the annual South Korean tea consumption at per capita, compared to for coffee - grain teas are served in many restaurants instead of water. Herbal and fruit teas are commonly served, both hot and cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pithas are typically made of rice flour, although there are some types of pitha made of wheat flour. Less common types of pitha are made of palm or \"ol\" (a local root vegetable).\n\nPithas are primarily made from a batter of rice flour or wheat flour, which is shaped and optionally filled with sweet or savory ingredients. When filled, the pitha's pouch is called a \"khol\" (literally \"container\") and the fillings are called \"pur\".\n\nFor stuffed vegetable pithas, ingredients such as cauliflower, cabbage, radish, or potato are usually fried, baked, or steamed, and then mashed, cooled, and formed into small balls to stuff into the pithas.\n\nSweet pithas typically contain sugar, jaggery, date juice, or palm syrup, and can be filled with grated coconut, cashews, pistachios, sweetened vegetables, or fruits. Sweet pithas are also often flavored using cardamom or camphor.\n\nDepending on the type of pitha being prepared, pithas can be fried in oil or ghee, slow-roasted over a fire, steamed, or baked and rolled over a hot plate.\n\nPithas are often eaten during breakfast and as a snack with (often with tea), although there are many sweet varieties that are reserved for desserts or holidays.\n\nPithas vary considerably across the regions of the eastern Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThe pitha is a very popular and liked food to all the Bengali.While some pitha can be made at any time of the year in the Bengal region (Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal), there are special pitha strongly associated with harvest festivals such as Nabanna ( \"nôbanno\", literally \"new rice\" or \"new food\") and the \"Poush parbon\" or Makar Sankranti, celebrated on January 14 every year. Pitha are usually made with rice flour, milk, coconut and jaggery. It is often served with sweet syrups such as date tree molasses ( \"khejurer guṛ\"). Some of the most common pitha found in Bengal (both in Bangladesh and West Bengal) include the following:\n\n\nIn Odisha, Pithas () are special delicacies in an Odia home.

The liquid part is known as toraṇi. It is popular in Odisha, Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu. \n\nIn Tamil Nadu it is called Pazhaiya Sadam. The Bengali name for this dish is panta bhat, in Chhattisgarh it's called bore bhat, in Jharkhand linguistic communities use names like paani bhat, paakhaal or pakhala, and in Assam it's called poita bhat.\n\nA traditional Odia dish, it is prepared with rice, curd, cucumber, cumin seeds, fried onions and mint leaves. It is popularly served with roasted vegetables—such as potato, brinjal, badi and saga bhaja or fried fish.\n\nThe term \"pakhala\" is derived from Pali word \"pakhaliba\" () as well as Sanskrit word \"Prakshāḷaṇa\" (Sanskrit: प्रक्षाळन) which means \"washed/to wash.\" The word \"pakhaḷa\" was used in the Odia poems of Arjuna Das in his literary work \"Kaḷpalata\" (1520-1530 AD).\nMarch 20 is celebrated as Pakhala Dibasa.\n\nIt is unknown when pakhaḷa was first included in the daily diet of Eastern India, but it was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath Temple of Puri circa 10. Pakhaḷa is eaten in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent (including Nepal and some parts of Myanmar).\n\nTo beat the heat, this dish is cooked and cooled in a bowl with full of plain water. Odisha, Bengal, Assam, and Chhattisgarh also have this dish in their cuisine. To promote this food, 20 March is celebrated as Pakhala Dibas or day.\n\n\nThe dish is typically prepared with rice that is cooked and allowed to cool. Cook normal rice, then cool it. Pour water in a bowl and add rice to it. In a pan, heat a pinch of oil, add mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry red chili and fry well. Add this \"chhunka\" or tadka into the pakhala bowl with sour curd. One can add mint leaves and raw salt to enhance the taste. To add more zing, one may opt for fish fry or sukhua poda (dry fish fried), saga bhaja, badi chura (a regional food item made up of batter of urad or black gram by drying under sunshine as small nuts and then fried to serve) and much more. Cumin seeds are fried, ground into a fine powder and added to curd with coriander leaves and salt.\n\nIt is sometimes served with a fish fry and spinach.\n\nPakhaḷa is slightly fermented rice. The rice is cooked, water is added with little bit of old pakhal (something similar to making curd using milk and old curd). Pakhaḷa tastes best when served after 8 to 12 hours after preparation; in this case, no old pakhal is required to be added to the rice as fermentation usually happens after 6 hours of keeping rice in water.\n\nGenerally burnt potato or \"aloo poda\" (boiled is also used) and other fried vegetables or fried fish is served with pakhaḷa. Modern-day variation is to add curd instead of fermenting it.\n\n20 March is declared \"Pakhala Dibasa\" (Universal Pakhala Day) by Odias worldwide.\n\n\n"}

Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of \"The Washington Post\" publisher Katharine Graham.\n\nTruman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party. He was at the height of his popularity as an author and as a public figure following the publication of his non-fiction novel, \"In Cold Blood\", earlier that year. For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society.\n\nAccording to Capote's friend, the writer and editor Leo Lerman, Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writer's colony Yaddo that when he, Capote, became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends. Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the ball's legend.\n\nCapote's friend, author Dominick Dunne, had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary. Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching \"In Cold Blood\". Capote was also inspired by the \"Ascot scene\" from the film \"My Fair Lady\" in which the women were all dressed in black and white.\n\nAfter deciding to throw the party, Capote had to select a guest of honor. Throwing the party for himself would have been viewed by his society friends as vulgar. Rather than selecting from amongst his stable of beautiful society women he called his \"swans\", Capote chose \"The Washington Post\" publisher Katharine Graham. \"Truman called me up that summer and said, 'I think you need cheering up. And I'm going to give you a ball.'...I was...sort of baffled...I felt a little bit like Truman was going to give the ball anyway and that I was part of the props.\"\n\nFor his venue, Capote chose the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Capote had long held a deep affection for the Plaza, even setting the opening scene of his attempted first novel, \"Summer Crossing\", in a Plaza dining room. Capote enlisted Evie Backer, who had decorated his apartment at United Nations Plaza, for the event's decor. Initially Capote planned to cover the ballroom's white and gold walls with heavy red drapes but Backer and Capote's friend Babe Paley convinced him to abandon this idea. Instead he brought in the color with red tablecloths. Rather than flowers, Capote had the tables adorned with gold candelabra wound with smilax and bearing white tapers. The night's menu, to be served at midnight, consisted of scrambled eggs, sausages, biscuits, pastries, spaghetti and meatballs and chicken hash, a specialty of the Plaza and one of Capote's favorite dishes. To drink Capote laid in 450 bottles of Taittinger champagne.\n\nCapote spent a total of $16,000 on the ball.\n\nCapote purchased a black-and-white composition book and spent most of July sitting by his friend Eleanor Friede's pool compiling his initial guest list. Capote carried the book with him everywhere he went for the next three months, constantly adding and deleting names.\n\nBefore the ball, many of the guests attended one of sixteen small private dinner parties that Capote's friends had been drafted to host.\n\nThe Black and White Ball was credited with starting an immediate upsurge in masquerade and costume parties. It has been described as \"a pinnacle of New York's social history\". Six days after the ball, on the December 4 episode of the television panel show \"What's My Line?,\" panelist Arlene Francis wore the mask she had worn at the party, transformed into a blindfold. The wearing of blindfolds during the show's special Mystery Guest segment was customary on the part of the panel.\n\nPrincess Yasmin Aga Khan hosted a Black and White Ball in 1991, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the original. The ball, held in a tent outside Tavern on the Green, was a charity event that raised $1.4 million for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nIn anticipation of selling the contents of the Plaza Hotel, Christie's Auction House recreated the Black and White Ball in 2006 at Rockefeller Center. The event followed Capote's dress code, schedule and menu exactly and the Peter Duchin Orchestra, which had played the original, played the recreation.\n\nTV chef Ina Garten recreated a scaled-down version of the event for a themed dinner party on her daytime cookery show Barefoot Contessa. She served chicken hash followed by French toast and truffles for dessert, in keeping with the black and white theme of Capote's party.\n"}

The English equivalent for \"ébéniste\", \"ebonist\", is not commonly used. Originally, an \"ébéniste\" was one who worked with ebony, a favoured luxury wood for mid-seventeenth century Parisian cabinets, originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in Antwerp. The word is 17th century in origin. Early Parisian ébénistes often came from the Low Countries themselves: an outstanding example is Pierre Golle, who worked at the \"Gobelins manufactory\" making cabinets and table tops veneered with marquetry, the traditional enrichment of \"ébénisterie\", or \"cabinet-work\".\n\nÉbénistes make case furniture, which may be veneered or painted. Under Parisian guild regulations, the application of painted varnishes, generically called \"vernis Martin\", was carried out in separate workshops, sawdust being an enemy to freshly varnished surfaces. At the outset of the French Revolution the guilds in Paris and elsewhere were abolished, and with them went all their regulations. One result of this is that Paris chairmakers were now able to produce veneered chairs, as London furniture-makers, less stringently ruled, had been able to make since the first chairs with splats had been produced shortly before 1720, in imitation of Chinese chairs.\n\nBecause of this amalgamation, chairs and other seat furniture began to use veneering techniques which were formerly the guarded privilege of ébénistes. This privilege became less distinct after the relaxation of guild rules of the Ancien Régime, and after the French Revolution's abolition of guilds in 1791. Seat furniture in the Empire style was often veneered with mahogany, and later in pale woods also.\n\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century onward, the two French trades, \"ébéniste\" and \"menuisier,\" were often assembled under the single roof of a \"furnisher\", and the craft began to make way for the industry. \n\nFrom the mid-17th century through the 18th, a notable number of ébénistes of German and Low Countries extraction were pre-eminent among Parisian furniture-makers, as the abbreviated list below suggests.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7747652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7747652", "title": "Reverse Monte Carlo", "text": "Reverse Monte Carlo\n\nThe Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modelling method is a variation of the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to solve an inverse problem whereby a model is adjusted until its parameters have the greatest consistency with experimental data. Inverse problems are found in many branches of science and mathematics, but this approach is probably best known for its applications in condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry.\n\nThis method is often used in condensed matter sciences to produce atom-based structural models that are consistent with experimental data and subject to a set of constraints.\n\nAn initial configuration is constructed by placing atoms in a periodic boundary cell, and one or more measurable quantities are calculated based on the current configuration. Commonly used data include the pair distribution function and its Fourier transform, the latter of which is derived directly from neutron or x-ray scattering data (see small-angle neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray diffraction). Other data that are used included Bragg diffraction data for crystalline materials, and EXAFS data. The comparison with experiment is quantified using a function of the form\n\nwhere and are the observed (measured) and calculated quantities respectively, and is a measure of the accuracy of the measurement. The sum is over all independent measurements, which will include the sum over all points in a function such as the pair distribution function.\n\nAn iterative procedure is run where one randomly chosen atom is moved a random amount, followed by a new calculation of the measurable quantities. Such a process will cause to either increase or decrease in value by an amount . The move is accepted with the probability according to the normal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, ensuring that moves that give better agreement with experimental data are accepted, and moves that worsen agreement with experimental data can be accepted to a greater or lesser extent corresponding to how much the agreement has worsened. Moreover, the move may also be rejected if it breaks certain constraints, even if the agreement with data is improved. An example would be to reject a move which brings two atoms closer than a preset limit, to prevent overlap or collision between the two atoms.\n\nFollowing the acceptance/rejection test, the procedure is repeated. As the number of accepted atom moves increases, the calculated quantities will become closer to the experimental values until they reach an equilibrium state. From then onward the RMC algorithm will simply generate a small oscillation in the value of . The resulting atomic configuration should be a structure that is consistent with the experimental data within its errors.\n\nThe RMC method for condensed matter problems was initially developed by McGreevy and Pusztai in 1988, with application to liquid argon (Note that there were earlier independent applications of this approach, for example those of Kaplow et al. and Gerold and Kern; it is, however, the McGreevy and Pusztai implementation that is best known). For several years the primary application was for liquids and amorphous materials, particularly because this provides the only means to obtain structural models from data, whereas crystallography has analysis methods for both single crystal and powder diffraction data. More recently, it has become clear that RMC can provide important information for disordered crystalline materials also.\n\nThe RMC method suffers from a number of potential problems. The most notable problem is that often more than one qualitatively different model will give similar agreement with experimental data. For example, in the case of amorphous silicon, the integral of the first peak in the pair distribution function may imply an average atomic coordination number of 4. This might reflect the fact that all atoms have coordination number of 4, but similarly having half the atoms with coordination number of 3 and half with 5 will also be consistent with this data. Unless a constraint on the coordination number is employed, the RMC method will have no means of generating a unique coordination number and most likely a spread of coordination numbers will result. Using amorphous silicon as an example, Biswas, Atta-Fynn and Drabold were the first to elucidate the importance of including constraints in RMC modeling. Since the RMC method follows the normal rules of statistical mechanics, its final solution will be the one with the highest degree of disorder (entropy) possible. A second problem comes from the fact that without constraints the RMC method will typically have more variables than observables. One result from this will be that the final atomic configuration may have artifacts that arise from the method attempting to fit noise in the data.\n\nOne should remark, however, that most applications of the RMC approach today take account of these problems by appropriate use of implicit or explicit constraints.\n\nThere are four publicly available implementations of the RMC method.\n\nFUndamental Library Language for Reverse Monte Carlo or fullrmc is a multicore RMC modeling package. fullrmc is a fully object-oriented python interfaced package where every definition can be overloaded allowing easy development, implementation and maintenance of the code. fullrmc's computation blocks and modules are optimized written in cython/C. fullrmc is not a standard RMC package but it is rather unique in its approach to solving an atomic or molecular structure. fullrmc supports atomic and molecular systems, all types (not limited to cubic) of periodic boundary conditions systems as well as the so-called infinite boundary conditions to model nanoparticles or isolated systems. fullrmc's Engine is defined and used to launch a RMC calculation. By definition, Engine reads only Protein Data Bank (file format) atomic configuration files and handles other definitions and attributes. In fullrmc atoms can be grouped into rigid bodies or semi-rigid bodies called groups so the system can evolve atomically, clusterly, molecularly or any combination of those. Every group can be assigned a different and customizable move generator (translation, rotation, a combination of moves generators, etc.). Groups selection by the fitting engine can also be customizable. Also fullrmc uses Artificial intelligence and Reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the ratio of accepted moves.\n\nRMCProfile is a significantly developed version of the original RMC code written by McGreevy and Puszta. It is written in Fortran 95 with some Fortran 2003 features. It has maintained the ability to model liquids and amorphous materials using the pair distribution function, total scattering and EXAFS data, but also includes the capability of modelling crystalline materials by explicitly using the information contained within the Bragg diffraction data. RMCProfile gives users a range of constraints, including the inclusion of molecular potentials and distance windows, which exploit possibilities afforded by the lack of significant diffusion in crystalline materials. RMCProfile allows simulation of magnetic materials, using the magnetic component of total scattering data, and also allows simulation of materials where atoms are allowed to swap positions (as found in many solid solutions).\n\nRMC++ a rewritten, C++ version of the original RMC code developed by McGreevy and Pusztain. RMC++ is designed specifically for the study of liquids and amorphous materials, using pair distribution function, total scattering and EXAFS data.\n\nHybrid Reverse Monte Carlo(HRMC) is a code capable of fitting both the pair correlation function and structure factor along with bond angle and coordination distributions. Unique to this code is the implementation of a number of empirical interatomic potentials for carbon (EDIP), silicon (EDIP and Stillinger-Weber ) and germanium (Stillinger-Weber). This allows the code to fit experimental data along with minimizing the total system energy.\n"}
