It consists of hollowed or halved peppers (typically bell peppers), filled with any of a variety of fillings, often including meat, vegetables, cheese, rice, or sauce. They are usually assembled by filling the cavities of the peppers and then cooking. \n\nStuffed peppers or pimientos rellenos are part of traditional Spanish cuisine, especially that of the region of the Basque Country. Usually piquillo peppers are used. The fillings vary from Manchego cheese, to chicken or cod in a red sauce; chicken likely being the most popular recipe.\n\nStuffed Peppers (Bharvan Mirch or Bharva Hari Mirch) is one of several stuffed vegetable (Bharvan subji) dishes. It consists of bell peppers stuffed with cooked meat, potatoes, and onions and seasoned with chili, turmeric, coriander, cilantro, salt, and lemon juice. The peppers are then either browned in a \"tava\" (frying pan) or baked in an oven until the peppers are scorched.\n\n\"Mirchi bajji\" or \"pakora\" is a \"chaat\" (street food) item and is a hot favorite during the monsoon and cooler months. In Mumbai and western areas, the big green chilli pepper is stuffed with a roasted, spiced flour mix and fried. In the South, the big green chillies, similar to hatch, is dipped in a flour batter and fried. It may be accompanied by chutneys and sauces. In Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, some of the smaller but more potent chillies are also stuffed and fried, especially as a side to rice.\n\n\nMexican cuisine has more than one stuffed pepper dish:\n\n\nIn Guatemala, the \"pimiento\" pepper is stuffed with shredded pork and vegetables. As the Mexican version, it is covered with egg batter and fried. It is served with tomato sauce or inside a bread bun.\n\n\nPunjena paprika (Croatian and Serbian for \"stuffed peppers\"), Speca të mbushur (Albanian), Filovana paprika (Bosnian), Faszerowana papryka (Polish), Polnjena paprika (Slovenian), Полнети пиперки (Polneti piperki) (Macedonian), Plněná paprika (Czech), Plnená Paprika (Slovak), Töltött paprika (Hungarian), Gefüllte Paprika (German) or Pulnena piperka/Pulnena chuska (Bulgarian), Фарширований перець in Ukrainian is a Central and Southeast European dish consisting of peppers filled with minced meat and rice. Most popular in the Zagorje and Vojvodina regions, it is influenced by Hungarian cuisine. The meat, usually ground beef, is mixed with herbs, spices and rice. In Bulgaria, stuffed peppers are usually eaten with yogurt. Another variety of stuffed peppers in Bulgaria is made with mixed white cheese and eggs instead of meat and rice as stuffing.\nArdei umpluţi () is Romanian for \"stuffed peppers\". This dish is usually prepared with bell peppers stuffed with ground meat (usually pork), rice, onion, and other vegetables and spices and then boiled in a sauce made from cream, tomatoes, and spices.\n\nStuffed peppers in American cuisine is a dish where bell peppers (often the green, yellow, orange, and red varieties) are typically filled with a stuffing such as ground beef, mixed with bread crumbs or cooked rice, eggs, herbs, and spices (especially paprika and parsley) and cheese. Recipes vary but often include the removal of the seeds of the pepper, boiling them, stuffing them, covering them with cheese, and baking or alternatively cooking them on the stove top at a slow simmer in canned tomato sauce until the peppers are soft. A sauce may be served with them, often a tomato sauce, but this, too, varies greatly.\n\n\n"}

The dish can be served as soup, deep fried or stir fried frog legs. Originally a Chinese dish, this dish is popular in Indonesia. \n\nThe name \"Swikee\" is from Hokkian dialect (, ) \"sui\" (water) and \"ke\" (chicken), which probably an euphemism to refer frogs as \"water chicken\". It is sometimes identified as a traditional food of Purwodadi, a city in Central Java. The main ingredient is frogs' legs (mainly from \"green frogs\") with the condiments of garlic, ginger and fermented soy paste (\"tauco\"), salt, and pepper. Once it is served, fried garlic and chopped celery may be added. Swikee is usually served with plain white rice.\n\nThe taste and texture of frog meat is approximately between chicken and fish. They are often said to taste like chicken because of their mild flavor, with a texture most similar to chicken wings. However, some may perceive a slight fishiness. Normally, the legs are the only part served in the soup, since the legs are the most meaty parts; the skin of the frogs may, however, also be dried under the sun, and fried as chips. The salted fried frogs skin has a unique taste incomparable with other types of chips.\n\nAnother type of frog cooking is \"\"pepes kodok\"\", frog cooked in pepes method, where the frog legs and different condiments are wrapped in banana leaves and put in a fire until cooked. The taste of the meat is enrichen with a distinct aroma of burned banana leaves.\n\nFrog-cooking is ubiquitous in Purwodadi, Grobogan Regency, Central Java, where it is the local delicacy. Frog leg cooking also can be found in the town of Jatiwangi, Majalengka Regency, West Java. It can also be found in the large cities of Indonesia, such as Jakarta, Cirebon and Bandung (where the most popular swikee restaurant chain is \"\"Swikee Jatiwangi\"\"), Yogyakarta, Semarang or Surabaya. Normally, a restaurant will use the name \"\"Swikee Purwodadi\"\" or \"\"Swikee Jatiwangi\"\" on its restaurant sign and menu.\n\nCurrently Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg. In the past, the frogs could be obtained from the wild, especially during rainy seasons. Lately, there are more and more farms that raise frogs due to increasing demand, especially from France.\n\n\"Swikee\" can be served in soup or stir fried according to the applied sauce.\n\nThere are two main issues dealing with frog legs consumption in Indonesia; the religion, and environmental issues. Frog meat is considered \"haraam\" (non-\"halal\") according to mainstream Islamic dietary laws. Frog meat fell under non-halal category on two prepositions; the meat to be consumed should not considered disgusting, and frogs together with ants, bees, and sea birds are animals that should not be killed by Muslims. The \"haraam\" status of frog legs had sparked controversy in Demak, where the official authority urged swikee restaurant owners not to associate swikee with Demak city, since it would tarnish Demak's image as the first Islamic city in Java, and is also opposed by its inhabitants that mainly follow the Safii school that forbids the consumption of frog.\n\nWithin Islamic dietary law, there are some debates and differences about the consumption of frog legs. The mainstream Islamic \"madhhab\" (schools) of Safii, Hanafi, and Hanbali strictly forbid the consumption of frog. However, according to the Maliki school certain types of frogs are allowed to be consumed; namely the green frog commonly found in ricefields, while other species especially with blistered skin are considered poisonous, unclean and disgusting and should not be consumed.\n\nEnvironment activists have urged restrictions on frog consumption — especially frogs harvested from the wild — because frogs are an essential element of the ecosystem. Conservationists have warned that frogs could be going the same way as the cod — gastronomic demand is depleting regional populations to the point of no return. Like most amphibians, frogs with their thin and moist skin are sensitive to environmental changes and pollution. The population of amphibians is threatened and declining globally due to habitat degradation, environmental destruction, and pollution.\n\n"}

These systems supply the production process with the right part, at the right time, In the right amount, using first-in, first-out (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a “pull system” in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub-processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts. This type of system is designed to maximize productivity by minimizing storage overhead.\n\nFor example:\nIf parts or material defects are found in one process, the Just-in-Time approach requires that the problem be quickly identified and corrected.\n\nProduction leveling, also called heijunka, and frequent deliveries to customer are key to identifying and eliminating Mura. The use of different types of Kanban to control inventory at different stages in the process are key to ensuring that \"pull\" is happening between sub-processes. Leveling production, even when different products are produced in the same system, will aid in scheduling work in a standard way that encourages lower costs.\n\nIt is also possible to smooth the workflow by having one operator work across several machines in a process rather than have different operators; in a sense merging several sub-processes under one operator. The fact that there is one operator will force a smoothness across the operations because the workpiece flows with the operator. There is no reason why the several operators cannot all work across these several machines following each other and carrying their workpiece with them. This multiple machine handling is called \"multi-process handling\" in the Toyota Production System.\n\nSome processes have considerable lead time. Some processes\nhave unusually high costs for waiting or downtime. When this is\nthe case, it is often desirable to try to predict the upcoming demand\nfrom a sub-process before pull occurs or a card is generated. The smoother\nthe process, the more accurately this can be done from analysis of\nprevious historical experience.\n\nSome processes have asymmetric cost. In such situations, it may\nbe better to err away from the higher cost error. In this case,\nthere appears to be waste and higher average error, but the waste\nor errors are smaller ones and in aggregate leads to lower costs / \nmore customer value.\n\nFor example, consider running a call center. \nIt may be more effective to have low cost call center operators wait for \nhigh value clients rather than risk losing high value clients by making\nthem wait. Given the asymmetric cost of these errors - particularly if\nthe processes are not smooth - it may be prudent to have what seems like\na surplus of call center operators that appear to be \"wasting\" call center\noperator time, rather than commit the higher-cost error of losing the\noccasional high value client.\n"}

Calissons have a texture similar to that of marzipan, but with a fruitier, distinctly melon-like flavour. Calissons are often almond-shaped and are typically about two inches in length. Calissons are traditionally associated with the town of Aix-en-Provence, France; consequently, most of the world supply of calissons is still made in the Provence region.\n\nThe calisson is believed to have its origins in medieval Italy. Among the first known references to calissons was in Martino di Canale's \"Chronicle of the Venetians\" in 1275. An earlier 12th century text written in Medieval Latin used the word \"calisone\" to refer to a cake made with almonds and flour. Yet another candy that is thought to be a relative of the modern calisson is \"kalitsounia\", which was made with marzipan, nuts, and spices such as cinnamon and cloves and was found in places occupied by the Venetians, such as Crete.\n\nSome trace the introduction of calissons to Provence around the mid-15th century at the second wedding of King Rene of Anjou. Others suggest that it was not introduced in its modern form until the 16th century, as this was when almonds became an established crop in Aix-en-Provence.\n\nThe calisson status has been protected in France since 1991 which means that local manufacturers need to follow strict methods to make them and that only applies in France. During 14 years, the French Union of Calisson makers were not able to get the international rights over the calisson as they could not agree on the exact ingredients of the recipe. To prevent foreign companies to use the \"Calisson d'Aix\" name, the union applied for the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in 2015 but it was already too late. In 2016, the French Union makers started a long legal battle with a Chinese company who had already trademarked the candy in China under the \"Kalisong\" designation. In 2017 the French union finally won and blocked the Chinese trademark registration. \n\n"}

Its texture is similar to the Chinese beef ball, fish ball, or pork ball. The word \"bakso\" may refer to a single meatball or the complete dish of meatball soup. Mie bakso refers to bakso served with yellow noodles and rice vermicelli, while bakso kuah refers to bakso soup served without noodles.\n\n\"Bakso\" can be found all across Indonesia, from street vendors to high-class restaurants. Along with \"soto\", \"satay\", and \"siomay\", \"bakso\" is one of the most popular street foods in Indonesia. Today, various types of ready-to-cook \"bakso\" are also available as frozen foods sold in supermarkets in Indonesia.\n\n\"Bakso\" is commonly made from finely ground beef with a small quantity of tapioca flour and salt, however bakso can also be made from other ingredients, such as chicken, pork, fish or shrimp. Unlike other meatball recipes, bakso has a consistent firm, dense, homogeneous texture due to the polymerization of myosin in the beef surimi.\n\nAs most Indonesians are Muslims which observes \"halal\" dietary law, generally \"bakso\" is made from beef, chicken or the mixture of beef with chicken. While in non-Muslim majority areas, such as in Chinatowns in major cities and Hindu majority island of Bali, pork \"bakso\" might be found.\n\nTraditionally the beef surimi paste or dough is made into balls using hands and boiled in hot water right away. After the meat are done, the meatballs are floating on boiling water, collected and being dried, stored or refrigerated for further use. Bunch of pre-cooked \"bakso\" are usually displayed in the window of a street vendor cart, and will be boiled in hot water per customer order, prior of serving.\n\n\"Bakso\" are usually served in a bowl of beef broth, with yellow noodles, bihun (rice vermicelli), salted vegetables, tofu, egg (wrapped within bakso), Chinese green cabbage, bean sprout, siomay or steamed meat dumpling, and crisp wonton, sprinkled with fried shallots and celery. Slices of bakso often used and mixed as compliments in \"mi goreng, nasi goreng\", or \"cap cai\" recipes.\n\nThe name \"bakso\" originated from \"bak-so\" (, ), the Hokkien pronunciation for \"fluffy meat\" or \"minced meat\". This suggests that bakso has Indonesian Chinese cuisine origin. Chinese influences is apparent in Indonesian food, such as \"bakmi\", \"mie ayam\", \"pangsit\", \"mie goreng\", \"kwetiau goreng\", \"bakso\", and \"lumpia\". Indeed, bakso texture is quite similar to Chinese beef balls, which is quite fluffy and has homogenous texture. Although \"bakso\" has Chinese Hokkien origin name, culinary experts suggests that it is likely that \"bakso\" was the mixture of culinary influences back in colonial Dutch East Indies. Also in Indonesian, the term \"bola daging\" is often refer to Western or European style of meatballs, which is different in texture and elasticity compared to bakso. For example, Swedish meatballs are translated as \"bola daging Swedia\" in Indonesian. The soup and the noodles probably originated in China, but the meatball, may have come from the Dutch, who colonized Indonesia in the 19th century.\n\nDespite its possible Chinese origin, \"bakso\" seems to had undergone localization, especially into Chinese Indonesian and Javanese cuisine. Today, most of the \"bakso\" vendors are native Javanese from Wonogiri (a town near Solo) and Malang. \"Bakso Solo\" and \"Bakso Malang\" are the most popular variant; the name comes from the city it comes from, Solo in Central Java and Malang in East Java. \"Bakso Solo\" is usually served with yellow noodle and rice vermicelli in beef broth, while \"Bakso Malang\" usually is enrichen with tofu and crispy fried wonton. In Malang, \"bakso bakar\" (roasted bakso) is also popular.\n\nIndonesia has developed numerous bakso variants, usually differing in shape, size, texture, ingredients, and fillings.\n\n\n\"Bakso\" is one of the most popular street foods in Indonesian cities and villages alike. Travelling street vendors, either by carts or bikes are often frequenting residential areas in Indonesia, while \"bakso\" \"warung\" and humble tent foodstalls are often sprung on street sides in Indonesian cities. \"Bakso\" first came to international attention when the United States President Barack Obama remembered it as one of his favourite foods from his childhood in Indonesia, and mentioned it in his speech.\n\nSimilar meatball dishes can be found in other Southeast Asian cuisines, such as those in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore, as well as Chinese-style meatballs.\n\nThe dish also similar with Vietnamese noodle soup with meatballs, \"Phở Bò Viên\". In Vietnam, \"Phở\" means noodle soup while \"Bò Viên\" is meatballs. Phở Bò Viên is one of version of Pho dish in Vietnam. It has been considered as the national dish of Vietnam.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, there is a similar meatball soup called \"bebola daging\", which actually a Malay translation of \"meatball\". Many recipe of \"bebola daging\" in Malaysia and Singapore are actually derived from either Western (Indian or European) and Eastern (Chinese) meatballs, such as \"bebola daging Masala\" which is derived from Indian cuisine influence.\n\nIn the Philippines, meatballs are called \"almondigas\" or \"bola-bola\", and are usually served in a misua noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash, and pork cracklings. \"Bola-bolas\" are also stewed or pan-fried until golden brown.\n\nIn the past, borax and formalin is often added into beef surimi mixture in order to preserve the produced bakso, also to make bakso more chewy (from borax induced myosin cross-linking) with less usage of meat. As a result, bakso is often listed by Indonesian Food and Drug Administration as an unhealthy foodstuff. The country's Directorate of Consumer Protection warns of the risk of liver cancer caused by high consumption over a period of 5–10 years. The government issued Sodium tripolyphosphate as borax substitute. Today's bakso, frozen bakso being sold at supermarkets and traditional markets in Indonesia are borax free.\n\n"}

Commercial varieties of clam dip are mass-produced by some companies and marketed to consumers in grocery stores and supermarkets.\n\nIn the early 1950s in the United States, the first televised recipe for clam dip appeared on the \"Kraft Music Hall\" show, a well-known and popular radio and television variety program that ran from 1933 to 1971. After the recipe segment aired, canned clams in New York City sold out within 24 hours. The ingredients used in this recipe were minced canned clams, cream cheese, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, salt and pepper. Clam dip remained popular throughout the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S., at which time prepared manufactured clam dips were available in U.S. supermarkets. As various tomato based salsas gained more popularity with American consumers beginning in the late 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of clam dip and similar dips made with sour cream and cream cheese declined.\n\nClam dip is typically prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It is used as a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.\n\nAdditional ingredients can be used, such as lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion, scallions, shallots, chives, garlic, and pepper sauce.

It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer.\n\nSome companies mass-produce commercial varieties of prepared clam dip and market them to consumers in grocery stores and supermarkets.

Old Overholt is a rye whiskey distilled by A. Overholt & Co., currently a subsidiary of Beam Suntory, which is a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan. It is produced at the Jim Beam distillery in Clermont, Kentucky. It is one of the most commonly available straight rye whiskies in the U.S., where it is available at most liquor stores. It is aged for three years and bottled at 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume). A four-year Bottled In Bond, 100 proof version was released in late 2017. Old Overholt has been called a \"foundation stone of American whiskey\" because of its long history.\n\nHenry Oberholzer (Anglicized to \"Overholt\"), a German Mennonite farmer, moved to West Overton, Pennsylvania, on the banks of Jacobs Creek in Western Pennsylvania in 1800. His family came from the area of Germany which specialized in distilling \"korn\", or rye whiskey, and Henry took up the tradition.\n\nIn 1810, Henry's son Abraham Overholt (1784–1870) took over management of the distillery and made it into a business. By the 1820s, the distillery was putting out 12 to 15 gallons of rye whiskey per day. Abraham grew the company rapidly; by 1843, Baltimore newspapers were advertising Overholt's \"Old Rye\"; at that time, only the very few top distilleries were advertised by name. By 1859, Overholt incorporated his business as \"A. Overholt & Co.\" He operated out of a new distillery building that was six stories high, 100 feet long, and which could produce 860 gallons per day.\n\nIn 1881, Abraham's grandson Henry Clay Frick took over the company. As one of the country's wealthiest people, the distillery was a sentimental side-business for Frick. Frick took on Andrew Mellon and one Charles W. Mauck as partners, each owning one-third of the business.\n\nIn 1888, Mauck adopted the name \"Old Overholt\" as the official name of the company, adding a picture of Abraham as the logo. Around that time, the company started selling its product in bottles instead of barrels. By 1900, Old Overholt became a national brand. In the early years of the 20th Century, Old Overholt became one of the largest and most respected whiskeys in the country.\n\nFrick died in December 1919, and left his share to Andrew Mellon. This ended family ownership in the company.\n\nThe national prohibition of alcohol in 1920 hit most American breweries and distilleries hard, putting many out of business. Perhaps because of its association with Mellon, who was then secretary of the treasury under Warren G. Harding, Old Overholt was able to secure a permit for selling medicinal whiskey. This permit allowed Overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use.\n\nIn 1925, under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a New York grocer, thus ending local ownership. The company was sold again in 1932 to National Distillers Products Co., which owned more than 200 brands.\n\nDuring World War II, Overholt and other whiskey distilleries were ordered by the government to make industrial alcohol. After war's end, whiskey fell out of favor with the American public generally, as drinkers switched to vodka. Rye whiskey especially fell out of favor, and by the 1960s, Old Overholt was the only nationally distributed straight rye whiskey. The brand struggled through the 1970s as sales continued to decline. In 1987, Old Overholt was sold to the James B. Beam Distilling Company, a subsidiary of American Brands, which moved production to Kentucky. Later the Jim Beam division was acquired by Suntory.\n\nSince December 2015, Old Overholt and Old Grand-Dad, both of which are Beam Suntory brands, have been marketed together as \"The Olds\".\n\nOld Overholt is closely associated with the Old West, particularly Tombstone, Arizona and is served in \"Old West\" tourist saloons in Tombstone today.\n\nThe brand was parodied in a Warner Brothers cartoon and in the Terry Pratchett novels \"The Dark Side of the Sun\" and \"Soul Music\" as \"Old Overcoat\".\n\nThe Old Overholt distillery was a plot element at the end of season 3 of \"Boardwalk Empire\". The distillery was part a deal between Andrew Mellon and Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson, who convinced him to let him manage it in order to implicate Jess Smith and George Remus.\n\nOverholt is mentioned as the favored whiskey of Sonny McGuiness, a prospector, in the novel EarthCore by Scott Sigler.\n\nOverholt is said to have been the alcoholic beverage of choice for notables ranging from Old West gunfighters to U.S. presidents, including:\n\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy said \"This very old brand of rye whiskey needles the drinker with zings of fruit flavors, grain bite, and sweet cereal notes.\"\n\nWhisky writer Jim Murray said \"creamy nose...citrus notes...very hard rye...momentarily moist and sweet before going on to perfect the driest, crispest finish of its genre\".\n\n\n"}

Malt loaf has a sweet taste and a chewy texture like very heavy, soft bread. It is made from malt and often contains raisins. Malt loaf is usually eaten sliced and spread with butter. Malt flour is sometimes used to supplement the flavour of the malt loaf.\n\nIn 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application titled Making Malted Bread which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. Montgomerie claimed a novel saccharification process which involved warming a portion of dough mixed with diastatic malt extract to an appropriate mash temperature and holding it for a time so the extract's enzymes would pre-digest some of the starch.\n\nSoreen ( ) is a popular brand of malt loaf. The name is derived from 'Sorensen', the name of the family that once ran the company. Rikki Sorensen developed the loaf in conjunction with a business partner Green, hence the name, Soreen. Rikki was also responsible for developing the technique for drying egg white used in many cooking recipes. In 2003 Warburtons sold the brand to Inter Link Foods and in 2007 Soreen became part of McCambridge Group. In 2014 UK food group Samworth Brothers bought the Soreen brand for an undisclosed sum. Aunt Ellen's is another popular brand. Both are produced in Manchester.\n\nHarvo was another brand of malt loaf which was made in Birmingham until the company went bankrupt in 1973.

It was a bread that was small enough to be held in the hand or glove (see also manchette).\n\nOne of the first recipes printed in English for manchet breads comes from 1588 and the recipe book \"The Good Huswifes Handmaide\" by an unknown author. In it the author explains that the flour must be fine and have been \"boulted\" twice.\n\nThere are several recipes for manchets mentioned in Florence White's classic English cuisine book \"Good Things in England\" first published in 1932. She gives five regional varieties of the bread and quotes from sources for the recipes. The first is from Gervase Markham in Nottinghamshire published in 1615 where White quotes an anonymous source that describes a manchet as 'Your best and principal bread'.\n\nThere is also a reference to \"Manchetts for the Queen's Maides\", a royal ordinance originating from Eltham Palace in 1526 during Henry VIII's reign which describes a menu for medieval aristocracy. It is inserted because a correspondent had requested when manchets were to be served at court. This suggests that in origin it was a luxurious bread containing ingredients that were available only to the wealthy. The most superior wheat for a manchet was said to come from Heston, near Hounslow during the reign of Elizabeth I. Manchets would sometimes be sweetened by the addition of scented ingredients such as rose water, nutmeg and cinnamon.\n\nBreakfast in the household of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, according to the household accounts from 1564 to 1632, for the earl and his lady on a \"flesh day\" was \"a loofe of bred in trenchors, 2 manchets, 1 quart bere, 1 quart wyne, a Chyne of Muton or Chyne of Beef Boilid; the two older sons had \"'2 loaf of household Breid, a Manchet, 1 Potell [two quarts] of Bere, a Chekynge [chicken] or ells 3 mutton Bonys boyled\".\n\nFlorence White makes reference to three contemporary versions. The Cornish manchant which she confirms is shaped by hand, a version from the Isle of Wight and a recipe from 1676 from Sussex for Lady Arundel's Manchet which is notable for the use of cream and milk in the constituents similar to brioche. The latter version she updates.\n\nManchets are little made today with the traditional Bath bun and Sally Lunn bun amongst the best known contemporary styles still made commercially. According to Elizabeth David, only the wealthy could have manchets for their breakfast or dinner and these became the 'ancestors' of eighteenth century french rolls or french bread.\n\n\n"}

In Kazakhstan the drink is known as \"shubat\", and is a staple summer food. Due to preparation requirements and perishable nature, chal has proved difficult to export. \"Agaran\" (fermented cream) is collected from the surface of chal.\n\nFermented chal is reputed to possess virucidal and virus inhibiting properties not found in fresh camel or cow milk, both in its liquid and lyophilized form — a characteristic which is (reputedly) unaffected by shelf life.\n\nChal is typically prepared by first souring camel milk in a skin bag or ceramic jar by adding previously soured milk. For 3–4 days, fresh milk is mixed in; the matured chal will consist of one third to one fifth previously soured milk.\n\nCamel milk will not sour for up to 72 hours at temperatures below 10 °C (50 °F).

On Easter Sunday, a cart, packed full of fireworks and other pyrotechnics, is lit and provides a historic spectacle in the civic life of the city.\n\nThe event of the Scoppio del Carro has its origins in the First Crusade, when Europeans laid siege to the city of Jerusalem in a conflict to claim Palestine for Christianity. In 1097, Pazzino de' Pazzi, a Florentine from a prominent family, was by tradition the first man to scale the walls of Jerusalem. As a reward for this act of bravery, his commander gave him three flints from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which were then carried back to Tuscany. These are kept in the Church of Santi Apostoli.\n\nIt became the practice for a \"holy fire\" to be struck from these flints at Eastertide, which was then carried throughout the city by groups of young men bearing torches. In time, this tradition evolved to something similar to what is seen today; a cart bearing a large candle was rolled through the city to the cathedral, from where the holy fire would be distributed.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, the Scoppio del Carro assumed its present form.\n\nThe ultimate origins of the event may be quasi-pagan, since it involves a display of great noise and light to ensure a good harvest. Additionally, farmers from the Florentine countryside still observe the Scoppio del Carro with interest for this traditional reason.\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, the antique cart (in use for over 500 years), moves from the Porta al Prato to the Piazza del Duomo . Hauled by a team of white oxen festooned with garlands of the first flowers and herbs of spring, the cart is escorted by 150 soldiers, musicians, and people in 15th century dress.\n\nMeanwhile, a fire is struck using the historic flints from Jerusalem at Chiesa degli Santi Apostoli. It is then carried in procession to the cathedral square by members of the Pazzi family, clerics, and city officials.\n\nThe cart is loaded with fireworks while a wire, stretching to the high altar inside the cathedral, is fitted with a mechanical dove (the \"colombina\"). Shortly thereafter, at the singing of the Gloria in excelsis Deo during Easter Mass, the cardinal of Florence lights a fuse in the colombina with the Easter fire. It then speeds through the church to ignite the cart outside.\n\nDuring all of these stages, the bells of Giotto's campanile ring out.\n\nThe complex fireworks show that follows lasts about 20 minutes. A successful display from the \"Explosion of the Cart\" is supposed to guarantee a good harvest, stable civic life, and good business.\n\n"}

This practice has been traced back to the pre-Islamic Persia. Although Samanu is prominent for Haft Sin in Iran, the preparation \"mela\" and eating it is traditional in Afghanistan.\n\nThe wheat is soaked and prepared for days and so the entire process takes up to a week. Traditionally, the final cooking would take from evening till the daylight and was a party, mostly involving only women. This would be full of laughter and music and singing related songs. In Afghanistan and Uzbekistan the whole gathering, mostly women, gather near the huge pot: sit in a circle, sing songs, have fun, each of them waits for their turn to stir the sumalak. While stirring the samanak, wishes can be made. Also, whole walnuts are thrown in near the end of the preparation while making a wish. In the morning still warm sumalak is handed out to neighbors, relatives and friends. In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: \"Samanak dar Jūsh u mā Kafcha zanēm – Dīgarān dar Khwāb u mā Dafcha zanēm\".

Traditional Samanu is made entirely of germinated wheat and water (no other ingredients). Nowadays, it is common to add a bit of flour to speed up the thickening process, although this makes the paste taste somewhat bitter and less sweet.\n\nA plate or bowl of Samanu is a traditional component of the Haft-sin table.\n"}

Other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are occasionally used in its preparation, and additional vegetable ingredients are sometimes used. The word \"cheese slaw\" is a portmanteau of the words cheese and coleslaw. Its origins can be traced to Townsville in far north Queensland, Australia, and to Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. It is a common and popular dish in Broken Hill restaurants and households. Cheese slaw is also consumed in some areas of the United States.\n\nCheese slaw is prepared using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated carrot, and a mayonnaise dressing. Cheese slaw is very similar to some coleslaw recipes, but is distinguished by the inclusion of cheese. Cheddar cheese is typically used in the salad's preparation, although other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are sometimes used. It often does not contain cabbage, as per coleslaw, although cabbage is occasionally used. Cheese slaw may contain other vegetables, such as chives, spring onions, shallots, parsley, and broccoli.\n\nIn the United States, cheese slaw is sometimes prepared using blue cheese, and is sometimes used as a hot dog dressing. In addition to the base ingredients, cabbage is also sometimes used in U.S. versions of the dish. U.S. versions have also been prepared using blue cheese salad dressing, instead of mayonnaise.\n\nThe origin of cheese slaw has been somewhat disputed. Cheese slaw dates to at least 1939 in Australia, when a recipe for it was printed in the \"Townsville Daily Bulletin\", a newspaper published in Townsville, Queensland. The recipe was for a \"ham and cheese slaw\", and included shredded cabbage, cubed cheese, julienne ham, mayonnaise, lemon juice, and mustard. Cheese slaw recipes were also published in the \"Australian Women's Weekly\", a monthly women's magazine, in 1946 and 1966.\n\nSome people claim that cheese slaw originated in Broken Hill, New South Wales. Cheese slaw is found extensively in Broken Hill, where it is served in restaurants, prepared in households, and has been stated to be \"ingrained in the local diet\". It has been served in Broken Hill cafes and milk bars since the second half of the 20th century. In Broken Hill, it is typically served as a side dish. Some people in Broken Hill top barbecued chicken with cheese slaw, which causes the cheese to melt.\n\n"}
{"id": "10551699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10551699", "title": "Hawarden Kite", "text": "Hawarden Kite\n\nThe Hawarden Kite was a famous British scoop of 1885, an apparent instance of flying a kite, when Herbert Gladstone, son of the then Leader of the Opposition William Ewart Gladstone revealed to Edmund Rogers of the National Press Agency in London that his father now supported home rule for Ireland. \n\nThe expression refers to Hawarden Castle, which was Gladstone's home at the time.\n\nAlthough there is some historical debate surrounding the issue, the consensus is that the Hawarden Kite incident was a political disaster for William Gladstone. Gladstone had converted to Home Rule sometime during his second prime ministry of 1880–1885; however, he knew that passing it through Parliament, particularly the House of Lords, would be very troublesome. Therefore, Gladstone had sought cross-party agreement on the issue of home rule, thinking that the Conservatives should pass to make it easier to get it through the House of Lords. Catholic Emancipation in 1829, Corn Laws repeal in 1846, and the Reform Act 1867 had been all cross-party acts passed by Conservative governments. \n\nGladstone also felt that the Electoral Act of 1884, which increased the franchise, would give him increased and perhaps permanent majorities in subsequent elections. Formerly a Conservative MP, he was now head of the Liberal Party, and considered that support from the Irish Home Rule MPs would further strengthen his position in the House of Commons. The Irish Party was then a third force in parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, in London on 1 August 1885 the Conservative minister Lord Carnarvon, Viceroy of Ireland, had met Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Home Rule leader, for a confidential discussion to see how far each could meet the other's policy. Parnell assumed that Carnarvon was representing the Cabinet and would agree to his proposals that Carnarvon described as \"surprisingly moderate\".\n\nConservative leader Lord Salisbury wanted the meeting kept secret, now that he knew Parnell's position, and hoped also that Parnell would mention the discussion to Gladstone. This might move Gladstone to up the ante and formally declare his support for Home Rule, offering slightly more than Parnell had indicated to Carnarvon; Salisbury believed that such a declaration would split the Liberals.\n\nOn 17 December 1885 Gladstone's son, Herbert, had a letter published in \"The Times\". It included: \"Nothing could induce me to countenance separation, but if five-sixths of the Irish people wish to have a Parliament in Dublin, for the management of their own local affairs, I say, in the name of justice, and wisdom, let them have it.\"\n\nThis promised a large amount of local control within Ireland, but Ireland would remain linked to Britain, with Queen Victoria as head of state, and it remain in the British Empire. Being a modest measure, Gladstone hoped that Salisbury might feel honour-bound to allow his MPs to vote for and against the policy, thereby splitting the Conservatives.\n\nOnce news of Gladstone's conversion came to light following the Hawarden Kite, Liberals and Irish Nationalist MPs voted together to end Lord Salisbury's caretaker administration. This led Salisbury to believe Gladstone was playing games with him and he remained opposed to Irish home rule.\n\nSalisbury had commented on 9 November: \"The integrity of the Empire is more precious to us than any possession we can have. We are bound by motives, not only of expediency, not only of legal principle, but by motives of honour, to protect the minority.\" \n\nThat minority in Ireland formed the Irish Unionist Alliance and the loyalist Orange Order increased its numbers markedly. \n\nGladstone won the ensuing election, but when he proposed the Government of Ireland Bill later in 1886, 93 Liberal MPs voted against, prompting a further general election. The Liberals opposed to Home Rule contested as the Liberal Unionist Party and Lord Salisbury became prime minister with their support.\n"}

{"id": "10562587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10562587", "title": "Full breakfast", "text": "Full breakfast\n\nA full breakfast is a substantial cooked breakfast meal that typically includes bacon, sausages and eggs, and a beverage such as coffee or tea. It comes in different regional variants and is referred to by different names depending on the area. While it is colloquially known as a “fry up” in most areas of Britain and Ireland, it is usually referred to as a \"full English breakfast\" in England (often shortened to \"full English\"), and therefore, as a \"full Irish\", \"full Scottish\", \"full Welsh\", “full Cornish”, and the \"Ulster fry\" in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland, respectively. It is especially popular in Britain and Ireland to such an extent that many cafes and pubs offer the meal at any time of day as an \"all-day breakfast\". It is also popular in other English-speaking countries, particularly countries that were a part of the British Empire. On its origin, \"Country Life\" magazine states, \"The idea of the English breakfast as a national dish goes right back to the 13th century and the country houses of the gentry. In the old Anglo-Saxon tradition of hospitality, households would provide hearty breakfasts for visiting friends, relatives and neighbours.\"\n\nThe full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised British dishes along with such staples as bangers and mash, shepherd's pie, cottage pie, fish and chips, roast beef, Sunday roast and the Christmas dinner. The fried breakfast became popular in Britain and Ireland during the Victorian era, and appears as one among many suggested breakfasts in home economist Isabella Beeton's \"Book of Household Management\" (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a continental breakfast, consisting of tea or coffee, milk and fruit juices with bread, croissants, bagels, or pastries.\n\nThe traditional full English breakfast includes bacon (traditionally back bacon), fried, poached or scrambled eggs, fried or grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, fried bread or buttered toast, and sausages (also known as \"bangers\"). Black pudding, baked beans, cooked tomatoes, and bubble and squeak are also often included. In the North Midlands, fried or grilled oatcakes sometimes replace fried bread. The food is traditionally served with a mug of tea; more recently coffee is an acceptable alternative.\n\nAs nearly everything is fried in this meal, it is commonly known as a \"fry-up\". As some of the items are optional, the phrase \"full English breakfast\", or \"full English\" (or \"Full Monty\") often specifically denotes a breakfast including everything on offer. The latter name became popular after World War II after British Army general Bernard Montgomery (nicknamed Monty) was said to have started every day with a full English breakfast when in the campaign in North Africa.\n\nThe traditional Cornish breakfast includes hog's pudding and Cornish potato cakes (made with mashed potatoes mixed with flour and butter and then fried), or fried potatoes alongside the usual bacon, sausage, tomato, mushrooms, egg and toast. In the past traditional Cornish breakfasts have included pilchards and herring, or gurty pudding, a Cornish dish similar to haggis, not to be confused with gurty milk, another Cornish breakfast dish made with bread and milk.\n\nIn Ireland, as elsewhere, the exact constituents of a full breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomato. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included, as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and brown soda bread. Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to brown soda bread. Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products.\n\nThe \"breakfast roll\", consisting of elements of the full breakfast served in a French roll, has become popular due to the fact it can be easily eaten on the way to school or work, similar to the breakfast burrito in the United States. The breakfast roll is available from many petrol stations and corner shops throughout Ireland.\n\nAn Ulster fry is a dish similar to the Irish breakfast, and is popular throughout Ulster, where it is eaten not only at breakfast time but throughout the day. Typically it will include soda farl and potato bread.\n\nSimilarly to the breakfast roll seen in the rest of Ireland, in Northern Ireland they serve \"filled sodas\", which usually consist of a soda farl shallow-fried on one side and filled with fried sausages, bacon or eggs. Fried onions or mushrooms are usually added upon request. Filled sodas are a popular choice for breakfast from roadside fast-food vendors.\n\nIn Scotland, the full breakfast, as with others, contains eggs, back bacon, link sausage, buttered toast, baked beans, and tea or coffee. Distinctively Scottish elements include Scottish style or Stornoway black pudding, Lorne sausage, Ayrshire middle bacon and tattie scones. It commonly also includes fried or grilled tomato or mushrooms and occasionally haggis, white pudding, fruit pudding or oatcakes. As with other breakfasts it has become more common, especially within the home, to grill the meats, puddings and tomatoes and to only fry the eggs and tattie scones. Another more historical Scottish breakfast is porridge.\n\nEarly editions of \"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" referred to a \"Scotch breakfast\" as \"a substantial breakfast of sundry sorts of good things to eat and drink\".\n\nAs in the rest of Britain and Ireland, the composition of a Full Welsh Breakfast () can vary. However, with the new-found appreciation of Welsh food and recipes in the early 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a broad definition.\n\nThe traditional Welsh breakfast reflects the coastal aspect of Welsh cuisine. As such it will typically include Welsh cockles and laverbread (a seaweed purée often mixed with oatmeal and fried). Both delicacies are traditionally served with thick bacon, but a Welsh breakfast may also include Welsh sausages, mushrooms and eggs. Full Welsh breakfasts are accompanied by traditional breakfast drinks, with Welsh tea a ubiquitous choice. Today, as they are often served throughout the day in public houses or inns, a traditional beer or ale is not uncommon.\nModern alternatives to the traditional full breakfast will often develop the traditional seafood theme. Smoked fish such as sea trout or sewin may be served accompanied with poached eggs.\n\nThis style of breakfast was brought over to the United States and Canada, where it has endured. A full breakfast in these countries often consists of eggs, various meats, and commonly one type of fried potatoes – hash browns, home fries, Potatoes O'Brien, or potato pancakes – and some form of bread or toast. Big breakfasts of this kind are most often served on special occasions or weekends only, owing to the time needed to prepare them and the calories involved.\nIn the Southern US, grits are typically included. \n\nTypical breakfast meats in all of America are bacon, Canadian bacon, breakfast sausage, and ham. In Canada, peameal bacon or cretons are often served. Canada and the USA don't follow the trend of the rest of the Anglosphere where tea is the usual hot beverage for breakfast, but rather both strongly prefer coffee, drunk with milk, cream, or sugar. Maple syrup is common to both, with both nations having sugar shacks in their Eastern forests, Quebec producing the most. Both nations have diners, and there the most common components are eggs, bacon and/or breakfast sausage served with one or two of either toast, English muffins, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, French toast or waffles. Omelettes are a delicacy where anything goes, and several kinds of cheese are added to the mix depending on the desire of the cook, like cheddar, Colby, Monterey Jack, and feta. Eggs Benedict originated in New York and bagels wherever Eastern European Jews settled, but both are now a staple in both countries.\n\nThere is also great regional variety. Oatmeal, made with rolled oats, is commonly served at breakfast in much of Canada and New England, but it is generally replaced by grits in the Southeast, where the climate is too warm for growing oats and eating oatmeal for breakfast has become more popular in that region only in the past 50 years. Biscuits leavened with baking powder or baking soda are a staple of the South and a component of biscuits and gravy. Country ham is very popular in every Southeastern state other than Florida and replaces Canadian bacon in recipes. Scrapple and pork roll are breakfast meats common to Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey, and the sausages eaten in Texas and Florida are usually a type of chorizo. Country fried steak is a dish that originated in Texas and steak and eggs are popular in much of the Midwest.\n\nThe West is usually the home of dishes like migas, huevos rancheros, and the breakfast burrito, with all three spicy because they contain sizable amounts of chili peppers. Both coasts of Canada and the USA serve smoked salmon for breakfast and it is a staple in particular of First Nations of British Columbia. Eggs Sardou and Eggs Neptune are local variations on Eggs Benedict from Louisiana and Maryland, with each changing out the Canadian bacon with artichoke and crabmeat, respectively. Midwesterners used to eat calf brains with their eggs, and New Englanders will eat the johnnycake, and Spam is a staple of every Hawaiian plate. Californians invented the fruit smoothie. Juices vary with orange juice being the most popular, but also can be apple, cranberry, or pineapple.\n\nThe full breakfast, usually referred to as a big breakfast, is common in Australia and New Zealand and is similar to British/Irish and North American variants, with some differences, having spread to Australasia when it was a part of the British Empire. \n\nBacon, eggs, hash browns, and sausages are the most common aspects of the Australasian full breakfast. Tomato, barbecue and Worcestershire sauces are used frequently, as is cheese. Bread is used as the base for most breakfast dishes, however it is common to use bread (or toast) to make a bacon and egg sandwich. Breakfast muffins are an increasingly popular alternative to bread in the Australasian full breakfast. \n\nRegional variants are prevalent, with German influences particularly commonplace in South Australia.\n\nA few establishments in Hong Kong offer all day breakfast or brunch options (hybrid of English and North American items) from formal restaurants to low frills establishments.\n\nThe ingredients of a full breakfast vary according to region and taste. They are often served with condiments such as brown sauce or ketchup.\n\nSome of the foods that may be included in a full breakfast are:\n\n\n"}

Myanmar is one of very few countries where tea is eaten as well as drunk. Its pickled tea is unique in the region, and is not only regarded as \"the\" national delicacy but plays a significant role in Burmese society. Its place in the cuisine of Myanmar is reflected by the following popular expression: \"Of all the fruit, the mango's the best; of all the meat, the pork's the best; and of all the leaves, lahpet's the best\". In the West, laphet is most commonly encountered in tea leaf salad ().\n\n\nTea is native to Myanmar, as in Bangladesh, Northeast India, Laos and China, both \"Camellia sinensis\" and \"Camellia assamica\", and grown mainly on the hills in northern Shan State around Namhsan in the Palaung substate of Tawngpeng, but also around Mogok in Mandalay Division, and Kengtung in eastern Shan State. \"Zayan\" leaves, which make up about 80% of the harvest, are best picked in April and May before the onset of the monsoons, but they can be picked until October.

First is mainly used to serve in ceremonies and is called \"A-hlu lahpet\" () or Mandalay lahpet. The second one is mostly served with meals and is more popular.\n\nThe best tea leaves are selected for fermenting and the rest for drying. They are steamed for about five minutes before either drying or fermenting. Young leaves are packed into bamboo vats set in pits and pressed by heavy weights; the fermentation process is checked at intervals and the pulp may occasionally require re-steaming.\n\"A-hlu lahpet\" () or Mandalay lahpet is served traditionally in a shallow lacquerware dish called \"lahpet ohk\" with a lid and divided into small compartments. Pickled tea is laced with sesame oil in a central compartment surrounded, in their own compartments, by other ingredients namely crisp fried garlic, chickpeas, butterfly peas, Australian peas, and toasted sesame and peanuts, crushed dried shrimp, preserved shredded ginger and fried shredded coconut. A rare treat in Mandalay may be a delicacy, dried and lightly pan-fried, called \"twin poh\" — a species of aquatic grub that is found only in a lake in the crater of an extinct volcano called Twindaung near Monywa.\n\nNo special occasion or ceremony in Myanmar is considered complete without lahpet. \"A-hlu\" means alms and is synonymous with a novitiation ceremony called \"shinbyu\". Lahpet is served in this form at \"hsun jway\" (offering a meal to monks) and weddings. Nat (spirit) worship features lahpet offered to the guardian spirits of forests, mountains, rivers and fields. Invitation to a \"shinbyu\" is traditionally by calling from door to door with a \"lahpet ohk\", and acceptance is indicated by its partaking.\n\nIt may be served as a snack or after a meal holding centre stage on table with green tea; it may be just for the family and visitors. Apart from its bittersweet and pungent taste and leafy texture, many believe in its medicinal properties as beneficial for the digestive system and controlling bile and mucus. Its stimulant effect to ward off tiredness and sleepiness is especially popular with students preparing for exams, \"pwè\" goers at all-night theatrical performances, and helpers at funerals who keep watch overnight.\n\n\"Lahpet thohk\" () or Yangon lahpet is pickled tea salad which is very popular all over Myanmar, especially with women. Some teashops would have it on their menu as well as Burmese restaurants. It is prepared by mixing all the above ingredients without the coconut but in addition includes fresh tomatoes, garlic and green chilli, sometimes shredded cabbage, and is dressed with fish sauce, sesame or peanut oil, and a squeeze of lime. Many would have lahpet together with plain white rice, again a student favourite. This form is traditionally served at the end of every meal.\n\nSome of the most popular brands sold in packets include \"Ayee Taung lahpet\" from Mandalay, \"Shwe Toak\" from Mogok, \"Yuzana\" and \"Pinpyo Ywetnu\" from Yangon. Mixed ingredients of fried garlic, peas, peanuts and sesame have become available as \"Hna-pyan jaw\" (literally twice fried) for convenience although traditionally they have been sold separately. Ayee Taung has been around for over 100 years and its new recipes such as \"Shu-shè\" (extra hot) and \"Kyetcheini\" (Red Cross) are quite popular. \"Zayan lahpet\" is mixed with carambola (star fruit), and pickled young leaves may be cut together with coarse leaves. Many prefer Mogok lahpet as it uses only young tea leaves.\n\nIn the Northern Thai provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son, \"lahpet thohk\" can be found at restaurants where Shan ethnic food is served. In Thai, it is called \"yam miang\" (ยำเหมียง), from Shan \"neng yam\" ().\n\nOn 12 March 2009, the Ministry of Health announced that 43 brands of lahpet including the popular brands contained a dye, auramine O, that is not permitted for food use. This was believed to arise from wholesale dealers using cheaper chemical dyes instead of the traditional food dyes. Singapore ordered a ban on 20 brands of lahpet from Burma, including eight varieties marketed by Yuzana, which were not declared unsafe by the Burmese authorities. Businesses were hit by a dramatic drop in sales of this popular food considered indispensable at social gatherings and on special occasions. Malaysia joined the ban but not Thailand, which has a sizeable Burmese population.\n\nLahpet was an ancient symbolic peace offering between warring kingdoms in the history of Myanmar, and is exchanged and consumed after settling a dispute. In pre-colonial and colonial times, lahpet was served after the civil court judge made a verdict; if the arbitrators ate the lahpet, this signified formal acceptance of the verdict.\n\n"}

DTL now forms part of the family of trap disciplines and in number of competitors is undoubtedly the largest variant, especially in the Commonwealth countries where it is most popular. Competitors use a double barrelled shotgun, usually 'under-and-over' type, and are allowed to fire both barrels at a single target released on the traditional call of 'Pull!'. The maximum load permitted is 28g per cartridge, slightly larger than the Olympic disciplines which use a standard 24g load.\n\nThe traditional DTL shooting layout is set up with 5 stands in a crescent shape 16 yards from a traphouse, which throws a random target from an oscillating trap between 0 and 22.5 degrees to either side of a center post, set 50–55 yards from the traphouse. The clay should always be on a common trajectory for height, even though it is variable in horizontal angle. The average speed for a down the line clay target leaving the traphouse is usually 42mph +/- 1mph.\n\nA normal competition would have the competitor shooting at 100 targets in total in a day. This would be built up of 25 targets at 4 different layouts (traps) with 5 targets shot on each stand rotating on a 1 > 2 »> 5 basis, hence 100 targets total.\n\nThe scoring of points is 3 points for first barrel kill, 2 points for a second barrel kill, 0 points for a lost target. A perfect score is therefore 100 targets each 'killed' with the first barrel, total 300 points. The 100/300 is a real achievement, the 4-minute mile or the 147 break of the trap shooter.\n\nScores are expressed with number of kills followed by number of points e.g. 98/292 would mean 2 birds missed completely and a total of 8 points dropped due to having second barreled 2 including missing 2. Competitions are decided only by points, so this score would beat a 100/291.\n\nThe competition is shot in 'squads' of a maximum of 5 shooters occupying the 5 stands which are also called pegs. These squads are not usually teams as such, but groups of individual shooters shooting in turn i.e. Competitor 1 on peg 1 shoots 1 target; then competitor 2 on peg 2; etc. until each has shot 5 targets from each peg. They then move one peg to the right before shooting a further 5 shots in turn from that peg and so on until 5 shots have been taken from all 5 pegs, the 25 targets on that layout (aka trap).\n\nDTL is perhaps the 'easier' single shot to make of any clay shooting discipline, but the result is an incredibly high standard of competition. Even a small club shoot will see almost perfect scores posted by the better shots, so concentration and mental strength are the real talents displayed by competitors.\n\nMost governing bodies record their members scores from every registered competition and then grade the competitors into classes, similar to a golf handicap. These classes are AA (nominally the elite shooters), A (expert), B (intermediate) and C (novice). Prizes are awarded in each class so competitors are shooting both for the overall 'HIGH GUN' (HG) and against their peers in their respective class. Averages are reassessed periodically (every six months in the UK for example) and shooters re-classified according to form.\n\nThere are further demarkations for Juniors, Colts, Ladies, Vets (60+) and Super Vets(65+), who will also be competing for HG and class honours. There are often further classes for disabled competitors, or for competitors who use wheelchairs. For major international events or Inter-County (IC) championships, teams representing each country or county may be formed.\n\nThe sport is very inclusive – a novice shooter can find themselves on a squad alongside a World Champion, his wife, grandfather and grandson competing on equal terms. Competitors come from every walk of life and as entry to a typical club competition is on average around £30 and cartridges for an event perhaps the same again, the cost of competition is modest. It is certainly not the preserve of the wealthy.\n\nMost shooting grounds will offer trial lessons and experience days. \n\nOther variations are \"double rise DR\", \"single barrel SB\", \"automatic ball trap ABT\", and \"handicap by distance HPD\".\n\nThe Governing Bodies in the UK and Ireland are the Clay Pigeon Shooting Association (CPSA; England), Irish Clay Pigeon Shooting Association (IPSCA), Ulster Clay Pigeon Shooting Association (UCPSA; Northern Ireland), Scottish Clay Target Association (SCTA) and Welsh Clay Target Shooting Association (WCTSA).\n\nIn the UK, the British DTL Championships are held in July every year, namely the Home Internationals and British Open events. These are held every year on rotation between England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and, the newest inclusion, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Home International (HI) consists of all host countries competing with teams of 25 seniors, 5 ladies, 5 veterans and 5 juniors to become the winning nation. The main competition is between the seniors with their greatest involvement in the event, although there is great pride shown when the other teams win their specific competition. On the night after the international there is a hosted banquet in which the prizes for the day are handed out.\n\nThe British Open has an element of the previous days activities with the teams competing but greater emphasis is put on the competition of the overall British senior, ladies, veteran and junior champions.\n\nNorthern Ireland hosted their first ever DTL Home International and British Open in 2006 at Culbann C.P.C, Ballynease, County Londonderry. This event was the culmination of a lot of preparation from Culbann C.P.C, by upgrading from a 4-layout facility to an 8-layout facility. Through the upgrading of the ground, the 4 layouts originally used were deemed redundant and they have been demolished to make space for the 8 new layouts. It was a great time for Northern Ireland as not only hosting the event for the first time, they managed to walk away as the overall winners of the Home International 2006.\n\nIn 2014 the championships will be hosted by Bywell SG in Northumberland, England.\n\nThere are several 'major' competitions every year in the UK, each attracting around 600 or more competitors. Competition is usually over two days, though some are one day, and sponsor or preliminary/warm up shoots take place on the days leading up to the main event. Amongst these are the Krieghoff at Mid Wales SG, Perazzi at Bywell SG and the Dougall Memorial (shot since 1903), the English Open and the British Open which move from ground to ground.\n\nThere are also the Euros held each year, that will attract teams and competitors from other nations such as France, Sweden, Germany amongst many others.\n\nEvery two years, the DTL World Championships are held, alternating between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In 2014 New Zealand host the 11th Worlds, following Wales in 2012, South Africa in 2010, Ireland in 2008, Australia in 2006. It returns to Ireland in 2016.\n\nThis is held over three days with 100 targets shot on each of the first two days, then a further 50 on the morning of day three. Scores are collated and the top 10% of competitors in each class (AA, A, B and C) proceed to shoot a further 50 targets (total 300) and the scores are added to the previous 250 to decide the places. Shoot offs are held to determine any significant places where tied.\n\n\"List of English Sport Shooters\"\n\n"}

Throughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. Village Seowon, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite.\n\nDuring the earlier period of Joseon in 15th and 16th century, tension between the Hungu faction in the Capital and the Yeongnam-based Sarim faction dominated national politics, which culminated in a series of four bloody purges between 1498 and 1545, in which Sarim faction was persecuted by the Hungu faction. Following these setbacks, the Sarim faction withdrew to rural provinces where they maintained power base and ideological continuity through Seowon and Hyang'yak (a system of social contract that gave local autonomy to villages). Eventually, the Hungu faction declined without an ideological successor while the Sarim faction emerged as the dominant faction during the reign of Seonjo.\n\nIn the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred within the Sarim faction between the Western faction (\"Seo-in\") and Eastern faction (\"Dong-in\"), composed mainly of younger generation. Political divisions intensified even further as the Eastern faction in turn split between the hard-line Northern faction (\"Buk-in\") and the moderate Southern faction (\"Nam-in\") and the Western factions split between the Old Learning (\"No-ron\") and the Young Learning (\"So-ron\"). The Northern faction further split into the Greater Northern and Smaller Northern factions. The faction names often derived from the relative location of their leader's house.\n\nThese factional splits grew out of allegiance to different philosophical schools and regional differences. For instance, the Eastern faction was largely Youngnam-based, and its subfaction the Southerners were mainly followers of Yi Hwang while the Northerners coalesced around the school of Jo Shik. The Gyeonggi and Chungcheong-based Western faction were largely followers of Yi I, of which followers of Seong Hon split to form the So-ron faction and Song Siyeol's followers became the No-ron faction. These divisions were often further driven by questions concerning royal succession or appropriate royal conduct. For example, the split between the Northerners and Southerners was driven by debate over the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son. The Northerners came to support the Gwanghaegun; accordingly, they flourished under his reign (1608–1623) but were swept from power by the Westerners after the succession of Injo.\n\nUnder the reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the 18th century, a strict policy of equality was pursued with no faction being favoured over another. However, in Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged as the ruling No-ron faction split further between the Byeokpa and Sipa, two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father. In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong Kim clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Cho clan.\n\nDuring the reign of Gojong, real power initially belonged to his father the Heungseon Daewongun, who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, Queen Min (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The Enlightenment Party (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. These factional struggles led to the Imo Incident and Gapsin Coup, as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.\n\n\nSarim --> \n\n\n\n"}

The most common version includes bacon and oysters combined with eggs, and fried together.\n\nThe dish was invented in Placerville, California, then known as Hangtown. According to most accounts, the dish was invented when a gold prospector struck it rich, headed to the Cary House Hotel, and demanded the most expensive dish that the kitchen could provide. The most expensive ingredients available were eggs, which were delicate and had to be carefully brought to the mining town; bacon, which was shipped from the East Coast, and oysters, which had to be brought on ice from San Francisco, over 100 miles away.\n\nAnother creation myth is the one told by the waiters at Sam's Grill in Tiburon, just north of San Francisco. At the county jail in Placerville, a condemned man was asked what he would like to eat for his last meal. He thought quickly and ordered an oyster omelet, knowing that the oysters would have to be brought from the water, over a hundred miles away by steamship and over rough roads, delaying his execution for a day.\n\nThe dish was popularized by Tadich Grill in San Francisco, where it has apparently been on the menu for 160 years. Later variations on the dish include the addition of onions, bell peppers, or various spices, and deep frying the oysters before adding them to the omelette.\n\nAccording to the El Dorado County Museum, \"No dish epitomizes California and its Gold Rush more than Hangtown Fry.

{"id": "10621538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10621538", "title": "Henosis", "text": "Henosis\n\nHenosis () is the classical Greek word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\" or \"unity.\" In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism, the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One (Τὸ Ἕν), the Source, or Monad. The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek mystery religions as well as parallels in Eastern philosophy. It is further developed in the Corpus Hermeticum, in Christian theology, Alevism, soteriology and mysticism, and is an important factor in the historical development of monotheism during Late Antiquity.\n\nThe term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of \"union\" or \"unity\".\n\nHenosis, or primordial unity, is rational and deterministic, emanating from indeterminism an uncaused cause. Each individual as a microcosm reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the macrocosm. In mimicking the demiurge (divine mind), one unites with The One or Monad. Thus the process of unification, of \"The Being\" and \"The One,\" is called henosis, the culmination of which is deification.\n\nHenosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward no thought (nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). As is specified in the writings of Plotinus on Henology, one can reach a tabula rasa, a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. \n\nWithin the Enneads of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge. The Monad or dunamis (force) is of one singular expression (the will or the one is the good), all is contained in the Monad and the Monad is all (pantheism). All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see monism). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the dyad called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul (World Soul).\n\nPlotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical Idealism.\n\nWithin the works of Iamblichus of Chalcis (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of theurgy. By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind. One goes through a series of theurgy or rituals that unites the initiate to the Monad. These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or cosmos. They also mimic the actions of the demiurge as the creator of the material world. Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person. Thus one without conflict internal or external is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but also in western mysticism, \"henosis\" can be acquired by theoria, hesychasm and contemplative prayer. Yet, the concept of theosis, or deification, differs from henosis, since created beings cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or ousia.\n\n\n.group || et/float.innerHtml\n\n\n"}

It is mainly popular with the rural folk of Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, especially in Western Tamil Nadu it is called Ragi Kali. Ragi is grown in Odisha as well where it is called Mandya, but these days people prefer rice. Similar variation known as Dhindo is also eaten in Northeast India, Nepal and Bhutan.\n\nRagi mudde, a store house of multi nutrients, has only two ingredients, the Ragi (finger millet) flour and water. A tablespoon of Ragi flour is first mixed with water to make a very thin paste and later added to a thick bottomed vessel containing water on a stove top. As this mixture boils and reaches the brim of the vessel, ragi flour is added which forms a mound on top of boiling water. The flour is allowed to cook in this fashion on medium high flame. Later with the help of a wooden stick (: \"mudde kolu\" / : \" hiTTin doNNe\"), the flour is beaten to a smooth dough like consistency with no lumps. This hot dough is then rested on low heat before rounding them on a wooden board into tennis sized balls with wet hands. Thus prepared Ragi balls are broke down into smaller balls using fingers and swallowed hot dipping them in 'saaru' / 'hesru' , chutney or gojju. It is not supposed to be chewed. Mudde, by itself, does not have a strong taste. Ragi Mudde is traditionally eaten with saaru (made of greens with sprouted grams, meat or vegetables), but can also be eaten with yogurt or butter milk. The saaru is often flavoured by mixing a dash of spicy, freshly ground green-chilli paste ( \"Khaara\"), in one's plate - according to taste. \"Ragi Mudde-Bassaru\" is a popular combination among the farming communities in Karnataka. Bassaru is made from the decanted water, which remains after (an assortment of) pulses are steamed (usually along with a couple of pods of garlic). This water takes up the earthy flavour of the pulses to nicely complement the earthy flavour of the 'Mudde' itself. Browned onions, red chillies, and some garlic are browned, and then ground into a paste along with grated coconut. This is added to the water, and the mixture is finally seasoned with Chaunk. The steamed pulses themselves are often used to prepare a dry side salad known as 'palya' ().\n\nThere are numerous variations of 'Bassaru', which each yield a differently named (usually, eponymous with the major ingredient) saaru. Bassaru is itself the portmanteau of 'Bas(tira)' () (steamed) and 'saaru'. 'Uppesru' ()/ 'Uppsaaru' () is another common accompaniment to 'mudde'. This is often simply a stew comprising steamed horsegram, as well as the water used to steam it; with added salt. Sometimes, hyacinth-beans ( 'AvarekaaLu') replace the horsegram. The horsegram version is also known as 'HurLi saaru' ().\n\nRagi mudde is rich in the same nutrients that are found in Finger millet - namely fibre, Calcium, and Iron.\n\nRagi mudde is consumed with the famous Karnataka style Bassaaru or Chicken curry or Menthyada Gojju (sweet sour dish made of Fenugreek and Tamarind). It is the most famous and almost a daily food for most of the south Karnataka/old Mysore populace. Many luxury hotels serve Ragi Mudde on special occasions.\n\n"}

{"id": "10779147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10779147", "title": "Yasak", "text": "Yasak\n\nYasak or yasaq, sometimes iasak, (; akin to Yassa) is a Turkic word for \"tribute\" that was used in Imperial Russia to designate fur tribute exacted from the indigenous peoples of Siberia.\n\nThe origins of yasak can be traced to a tax collected from native, primarily non-Turkic populations in the Golden Horde. The word yasaq is a Russian variation of the Qazaq/Turk word 'Zhasaq', which has two meanings:\n\nFirst, 'This is what you have to do', from a law decree of that time introduced by the Great Shyngys Khan (Genghis Khan)'.\n\nSecond is a 'ten-men troop', who were the smallest cell in the army, who also came to collect the tribute of 1/10 of profits in favour of the Altyn Orda (Golden Horde), and their name became the shadow of the tribute and in return stayed in European languages under associative name rather than real definition. \n\nThere is much uncertainty as to the time when the concept of yasak was introduced in Muscovy. It appears likely that the tax was inherited by Muscovy from the Volga khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan - two fragments of the Golden Horde that were subjugated by Ivan IV in the 1550s. These territories were settled by a range of non-Christian peoples who were expected to pay yasak either in kind or cash. The late French scholar of Eurasian history, Renee Grousset, traces \"yasaq\" (Regulations) back still further in his classic work, \"The Empire of the Steppes\", to the moral code imposed by Genghis Khan on his original horde. The Yasaq continued to be practiced by Mongol hordes until they came under Yellow Church Buddhist (Mongolia, China) and Muslim influences (Golden Horde, Persia, Central Asia) in successive centuries.\n\nThe earliest mention of the tax is found in a letter sent by Ismail (a ruler of the Nogai Horde and ancestor of the Yusupov family) to Tsar Ivan IV in 1559, three years after Ivan's conquest of the Volga Delta and Astrakhan. The border between the two polities was not yet established, and Ismail complained that Ivan's governor of Astrakhan demanded yasak from those inhabitants of the delta that Ismail considered his subjects, \"in grain from those who farm and in fish from those who fish\".\n\nYasak was gradually introduced in North Asia in the 17th century as a consequence of Russia's conquest of Siberia. The Tsar's relationship with natives was based on the quid pro quo principles. The annual delivery of yasak by the native representatives was normally accompanied by a state-sponsored feast and distribution of royal gifts to the natives. This compensation included tobacco, flints, knives, axes, and other useful tools. Some native populations, especially in the Far East, favoured multi-colored crystal beads. The local voyevoda could also provide the yasak-payers (\"ясачные люди\") with supplies of provisions such as fish oil.\n\nWhen the Tsar failed to deliver due compensation or his presents were deemed insufficient or too cheap, the yasak-payers would voice their discontent. According to one 17th-century report, not only the yasak-gatherers were beaten, but the natives proceeded to \"throw the sovereign's presents, and tie them onto dog's necks, and throw them into the fire, and they pay yasak with no courtesy, they kick it with their feet and throw it to the ground and the call us, your servants, bad people\". On several occasions, such conflicts prompted the natives to rise in rebellion against the Muscovite government.\n\nIt was against this volatile background that the Tsar's officials worked to transform yasak from an exchange of items (the centuries-old concept inherited from the Khanate of Siberia and Golden Horde) into a fixed and regular levy, but the process took centuries to complete. In many frontier areas it turned out that \"the regular supply of... presents to the local ruler and his nobles was, in fact, the only way to secure the natives' cooperation\". In the basin of the Volga, yasak was replaced with a regular tax in the 1720s, and most of Siberia followed suit in 1822. A largely symbolic form of yasak continued to be levied from the nomadic peoples of Eastern Siberia (Yakuts, Evenks, Chukchi) until the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nYasak collection procedures were not strictly regulated and varied considerably from ulus to ulus. A census was required to determine the numbers of yasak-payers, with results recorded in a list of yasak-payers, or \"yasak-book\", of which more than 1,700 survive from the 17th century alone. Each male yasak-payer between the ages of 18 and 50 was expected to take a \"shert\", or an oath of allegiance to the Tsar. \n\nMost peoples of Siberia paid tribute on a house-to-house basis, but the Yakut people delivered it based on the number of cattle in each household, while the Bashkir people paid yasak on the basis of a land census. Yasak was payable in sables, red foxes, beavers, martens; cattle was also allowed as payment in some circumstances. Yasak payments formed the basis for Russia's fur trade with Western Europe.\n\nThe Siberian Prikaz was responsible for yasak collection in Muscovite Russia. In 1727, an ukase decreed that yasak could be paid in cash, but this measure was found to be less than profitable for the imperial treasury and, twelve years later, it was revoked. The Cabinet of Ministers then decreed that yasak be paid in sables, or, in the absence thereof, in other furs.\n\nCatherine the Great undertook a reform of yasak collection by instituting a number of \"yasak commissions\", with the head office located in Tobolsk. In 1827 the task of yasak collection was entrusted to two principal yasak commissions, one for Eastern Siberia and another for Western Siberia, whose activities were regulated by a special statute.\n\n\n"}

Established in 1840, it was the first school built by private enterprises in NSW.\n\nIt currently enrols about 850 students, most of whom are from Campbelltown and the surrounding areas. Its current principal is Sue Lennox.\n\nSt Patrick's College was established in 1840. It was the first school built by private enterprise in the colony of New South Wales and was the result of the initiative of the Catholic people of the Campbelltown area in association with the priest responsible for the district, Fr Gould.\n\nThis original school was built on three acres of land donated by Mary Sheil, wife of Dennis Sheil and daughter of local pioneer, William Bradbury and named St Patrick's. The original building still stands today and is now known as ‘Quandong’, which houses the Campbelltown Historic Exhibition, Tourist Information Centre and the St Patrick's museum.\n\nTeachers from the general community staffed this early St Patrick's until 1887 when the Sisters of the Good Samaritan assumed responsibility for the school. In 1888, after the completion of the new St John's church in Cordeaux Street, a convent and school was established at the 'old’ St John's ‘on the hill’ building and took its name from the original St Patrick's at ‘Quandong’.\n\nThe final change in location came in 1970 when St Patrick's moved from ‘old’ St John's to its present location. This site was originally a Preparatory School for Boys named St John's or \"Westview\" and was also conducted by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. From 1970 until today the College has continued to grow and now has an enrolment of over 730 students from Years 7 - 12.\n\nVocational Education - VET\nBusiness Services, Hospitality - Kitchen Operations\n\n\nThe school's annual activities include:\n\n\nActivities that are offered throughout the year include: aerobics, circuit, pump, spin and body combat fitness classes, indoor rock climbing, yoga, dance, ten-pin bowling, tennis, competitive aerobics, martial arts and gymnastics. It is also a compulsory part of activities that all Year 10 students participate in a self-defence course.\n\n\n\n\nThere are four houses, each named after a significant female figures to Australia:\n\n\nOther Good Samaritan Schools\nThe College is a sister school to other Good Samaritan schools in Australia and overseas - St Marys Star of the Sea College (Wollongong NSW), Mater Dei School (Camden, NSW) Mt.

The term originated in America but is now also used in parts of Japan, South Korea and many other countries as either a brand name or a generic term. Names for similar confections in other places include chocolate marshmallow pie, Wagon Wheels, angel pie, Jos Louis, and moon pie.\n\nVariations of the original go back to as far as 1917 in the southern United States. In 1929, Chattanooga Bakery created the Moon Pie with marshmallow filling and Graham crackers for local miners in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nIn Japan, the confectionery became popular after American soldiers introduced it after the Second World War. In 1958 the Morinaga confectionary company introduced the \"Angel pie\", a chocolate covered marshmallow and cake sandwich (also called a \"half life cake\").\n\nIn 1973, a member of the R&D team of the Korean firm Tongyang Confectionery visited a hotel in Georgia, US, and was inspired by the chocolate-coated sweets available in the hotel's restaurant. He returned to South Korea and began experimenting with a chocolate biscuit cake, creating the “choco pie” as it is known to Koreans. The name \"Choco Pie\" became popular when Tongyang first released the Orion Choco Pie, and was well received by Korean children as well as the elderly because of its affordable price and white marshmallow filling. Tongyang Confectionery later renamed the company Orion Confectionery thanks to the success of the Orion Choco Pie brand.\n\nIn 1979 Lotte Confectionery began to sell a similar confection. When Lotte Confectionery put the Lotte Choco Pie on the market, it chose to spell the prefix 'Cho' slightly differently in Hangul from how Tongyang was spelling it. Haitai and Crown Confectionery also began selling their own versions of choco pies. Lotte also began selling as Choco Pie in Japan in 1983.\n\nIn 1999, after many years of sales of different \"Choco Pie\" products, Tongyang (Orion) filed a lawsuit against Lotte for their use of the term \"Choco Pie\", claiming the name was their intellectual property. The court ruled, however, that Tongyang was responsible for having allowed its brand name to become, over time, a generic trademark and that the term \"choco pie\" was to be considered a common noun due to its generic descriptive sense in reference to confections of similar composition.\n\nIn 2016, Orion released a banana-flavored Choco Pie to celebrate its 60th anniversary. It is the first variation of the original product in 42 years since the company launched the Choco Pie with marshmallow cream in 1974.\n\nIn 2017, Orion launched its premium choco pie Brand, \"Choco Pie House.\" \n\nStarting in the 2000s, Orion began using the Choco Pie to gain a foothold in foreign markets, and now controls a two-thirds share of the Chinese snack market, with a third of Orion's revenue coming from outside Korea in 2006. Around 12.1 billion Choco Pies have been sold all over the world.\n\nOrion has a share in four major markets – South Korea, Russia, Vietnam and China. In 2016, Choco Pie, which sold 600 million packs in Russia, is called the 'National Pie'. The snack has also been particularly successful in Pakistan, India, Vietnam and Taiwan.\n\nExports of choco pies to North Korea have been very popular, with North Korean workers at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea receiving choco pies in lieu of cash bonuses, which were seen as too capitalistic. Prior to the closing of the complex during the 2013 Korean crisis, workers received choco pies, which had become a favorite snack at Kaesong and also a symbol of capitalism, in addition to their wages. However, the workers at Kaesong would often resell their pies on the black market. In 2010, \"The Chosun Ilbo\" reported that choco pies could fetch as much as US$9.50 on the North Korean black market. Between 2008 and 2014,\nthe Lotte corporation estimated that it sent 1.2 million boxes of Choco Pie to North Korea.\n\nIn the wake of tensions surrounding its nuclear tests, the North Korean government temporarily shut down the Kaesung complex in 2013. This cut the supply of choco pies and drove the price in North Korea even higher. When the complex resumed operations after a five-month halt, employers were forbidden from paying choco pie bonuses, and advised to instead give bonuses of \"sausages, noodles, coffee and chocolate\". North Korea also responded to the choco pie speculation by producing its own variant of the snack.\n\nIn 2014 South Korean activists used helium balloons to launch 10,000 choco pies over the border to North Korea. Artist Jin Joo Chae made the controversy a subject of her prints and sculptures the same year, printing, with chocolate, real and imagined Choco Pie slogans onto North Korean newspapers, and simulating a black market for the snack in the gallery.\n\nIn 2017 a severely injured North Korean defector who crossed the DMZ to South Korea was given a lifetime supply of choco pies by their manufacturer.\n\n"}

Although horizontal convective rolls, also known as cloud streets, have been clearly seen in satellite photographs for the last 30 years, their development is poorly understood, due to a lack of observational data. From the ground, they appear as rows of cumulus or cumulus-type clouds aligned parallel to the low-level wind. Research has shown these eddies to be significant to the vertical transport of momentum, heat, moisture, and air pollutants within the boundary layer. Cloud streets are usually more or less straight; rarely, cloud streets assume paisley patterns when the wind driving the clouds encounters an obstacle. Those cloud formations are known as von Kármán vortex streets.\n\nHorizontal rolls are counter-rotating vortex rolls that are nearly aligned with the mean wind of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). They can be caused by convection in the presence of a moderate wind and/or dynamic inflection point instabilities in the mean wind profile. Early theory on the features predict that the vortices may be aligned up to 30° to the left for stably stratified environments, 18° to the left for neutral environments, and nearly parallel to the mean wind for unstably stratified (convective) environments. This theory has been supported by aircraft observations from several field experiments.\n\nThe depth of a vortex is usually the depth of the boundary layer, which is generally on the order of 1–2 km. A vortex pair usually has a lateral to vertical dimension ratio of around 3:1. Experimental studies have shown that the aspect ratio (a ratio of roll wavelength to boundary layer depth) has been found to vary between 2:1 and 6:1, however, in some situations, the aspect ratio may be as large as 10:1. The lifetime of a convective roll can last from hours to days.\n\nIf the environmental air is near saturation, condensation may occur in updrafts produced from the vortex rotation. The sinking motion produced between alternating pairs of rolls will evaporate clouds. This, combined with the updrafts, will produce rows of clouds. Glider pilots often use the updrafts produced by cloud streets enabling them to fly straight for long distances, hence the name “cloud streets”.\n\nThe exact process that leads to the formation of horizontal rolls is complicated. The basic stress mechanism in the PBL is turbulent flux of momentum, and this term must be approximated in the fluid dynamic equations of motion in order to model the Ekman layer flow and fluxes.\n\nThe linear approximation, the eddy diffusivity equation with an eddy diffusion coefficient K, allowed Ekman to obtain a simple logarithmic spiral solution. However the frequent presence of the horizontal roll vortices in the PBL, which represent an organization of the turbulence (coherent structures), indicate that the diffusivity approximation is not adequate. Ekman’s solution has an intrinsic inflectional wind profile that was found to be unstable to long waves corresponding to the organized large vortices scale. The nonlinear theory showed that the growth of these finite perturbation waves modifies the mean flow, eliminating the dynamic inflectional instability energy so that equilibrium is obtained. The modified mean flow corresponds well with observations. This solution for the layer containing the PBL-scale roll wavelength requires a modification of the flux transports to accommodate modeling of the advective motion of the large vortices.\n\nThe most favorable conditions for the formation of the rolls occur when the lowermost layer of air is unstable, but is capped by an inversion-by a stable layer of air. There must be a moderate wind. This often occurs when upper air is subsiding, such as under anticyclonic conditions, and is also frequently found when radiation fog has formed overnight. Convection occurs below the inversion, with air rising in thermals below the clouds and sinking in the air between the streets.\n\nTurbulent energy derived from dynamic instabilities is produced from wind shear energy. Higher wind favors this roll development while convective energy modifies it. Convection in the presence of low speed produces rolls as instability growth in shear is suppressed. Convection in very low wind environments generally produce cellular convection.\n\nAlthough this solution has been verified with numerous observations, it is complicated, involving Chaos Theory mathematics, and has not been widely used. However, when incorporated into the NCEP forecast models using satellite surface wind data, it significantly improved the forecasts. The nonlinear solution, with explicit description of the finite perturbation coherent structure rolls constitutes a significant contribution to the theory of Chaos for organization of turbulence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10878833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10878833", "title": "Variation (linguistics)", "text": "Variation (linguistics)\n\nVariation is a characteristic of language: there is more than one way of saying the same thing. Speakers may vary pronunciation (accent), word choice (lexicon), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called \"grammar\"). But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation – speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken. Linguistic variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native lect.\n\nVariationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs. Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously.\n\nLanguage variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the \"social\" characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding \"linguistic\" context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures.\n\nStudies of language variation and its correlation with sociological categories, such as William Labov's 1963 paper \"The social motivation of a sound change,\" led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of linguistics. Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.\n\nStudies in the field of sociolinguistics typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to\nPhonetic variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, morphophonological variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the glottal stop, the height or backness of a vowel or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a double negative). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in \"I kep' walking\" (Wolfram 1969; Labov et al. 1968); and the ING variable, the optional pronunciation of \"-ing\" at the end of a word as \"-in\"', as in \"I kept walkin'\" (e.g. Fisher 1958; Labov 1966/1982; Trudgill 1974).\n\nAnalyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant \"could have\" occurred. This is called the \"Principle of Accountability\" in Tagliamonte (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results. This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns \"that\", \"who\", and zero).\n\nThere are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.\n\nOne example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth. Just as street youth dress differently from the \"norm\", they also often have their own \"language\". The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world. Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. Age-graded variation is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies. Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'.\n\nPeople tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. William Bright provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'. This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north. Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the apparent-time hypothesis where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.\n\nA commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects (regiolects). Dialectology studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.\n\nIn 1968, John J.Gumperz conducted a survey on the inter-influence of geographic and social factors. By the end of the 1960s, it was examined that linguistic and dialect diversity cannot be solely interpreted by geography, which social differences existed in the same geographical area. Thus, social and geographical factors were to be seen as interrelated.\n\nMen and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).\n\nThe initial identification of a \"women's register\" was by Robin Lakoff in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society (\"female deficit approach\"). A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference (\"dominance theory\"). However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior.\n\nMore recently, Deborah Tannen has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences (\"cultural difference approach\"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a \"report\" style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a \"rapport\" style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.\n\nPeople tend to accommodate their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.\n\nCommunities of African Americans and Whites have been popular groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English. Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial step in understanding the origins of AAE. African American English and Southern White American English both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776). With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including Robbins Burling, Ralph Fasold, Joey Dillard, William Labov, Williams Stewart, Geneva Smitherman, and Walt Wolfram to name a few. While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify Ebonics as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons. There have been many different perspectives to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.\n\nVery little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in Asian American immigrants to the United States. Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the \"model minority\", in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term \"Asian Americans\" cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which \"the dominant ideology treats as a single entity\". The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization. Research on Asian Americans in particular have noted the variation of Asian American speech. Affluent Vietnamese Americans and middle-class Japanese Americans are shown to align to more standard English varieties, while Laotions and other Southeast Asians have more vernacular speech patterns. Ito (2010) looked at bilingual Hmong Americans in Wisconsin and found that local features like the low-back vowel merger did not seem to play a noticeable role in Hmong English. Despite the variety of ethnic background, Asian American speech shows distinctiveness in perception tests. Michael Newman and Angela Wu found that in perception tests, participants regardless of ethnic background were found to recognize Asian American, indexed by a set of distinctive features. While the amount of sound change studies are dearth, when they are addressed, it is focused mainly on \"language maintenance issues or code switching\", and rarely feature linguistic portraits of Asian Americans who have grown up within the diverse atlas of the United States.\n\n"}

It is usually filled with pork and gelatin that melts into soup/liquid when cooked. It has been one of the most common breakfast items in Shanghai since the early 1900s. As a ubiquitous breakfast item, it has a significant place in Shanghai cuisine.\n\nIn Modern Chinese, a filled bun is usually called \"baozi\" or \"bao\", while an unfilled (plain) bun is usually called a \"mantou\". However, in the Jiangnan region where Wu Chinese is spoken, the word \"mantou\"\" refers to both filled and unfilled buns, as in Middle Chinese. Hence, the \"shengjian mantou\" is called a \"mantou\" despite being a filled bun. The same is true of the \"xiaolong mantou\", which is often called \"xiaolongbao\" in the other varieties of Chinese.\n\n\"Shengjian\" is made from semi-leavened dough, wrapped around pork and gelatin fillings. Chopped green onions and sesame are sprinkled on the buns during the cooking process.\n\nThe name of the bun comes from its method of cooking. The buns are lined up in an oiled, shallow, flat pan. Typical commercial pans are more than a metre in diameter. The buns are lined up in the pan with the \"knot\", where the dough is folded together, facing downwards and thus in direct contact with the oiled pan and fried into a crispy bottom during the cooking process. Water is sprayed on the buns during cooking to ensure the top (which is not in contact with the pan or the oil) is properly cooked. After frying, the bottom of the bun becomes crunchy, and the gelatin melts into soup. This combination gives the \"shengjian\" its unique flavour. Because the buns are tightly lined up in the pan, they become somewhat cube-shaped after cooking. While waiting to be served, the chef may flip the buns so that the fried base faces upwards to prevent the crispy bottom from getting soggy in the process of cooling.\n\nThe traditional \"shengjian\" has pork fillings. Common variations include chicken, pork mixed with prawns, and pork mixed with crab meat.\n\n\"Shengjian\" is traditionally sold in lots of four (one \"tael\"). It is usually eaten at breakfast, and can be accompanied by a small bowl of clear soup. The buns themselves can be dipped in Chinkiang vinegar. Because of the method of cooking, especially the relatively hard bottom, the buns are quite durable, and are therefore easily portable. They are often packed in paper bags for take-away consumption.\n\nSome shops or restaurants sell the item throughout the day as a \"dianxin\" or snack. It is rarely found as a dish in a main meal.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10909992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10909992", "title": "Aztec cuisine", "text": "Aztec cuisine\n\nAztec cuisine is the cuisine of the former Aztec Empire and the Nahua peoples of the Valley of Mexico prior to European contact in 1519.\n\nThe most important staple was corn (maize), a crop that was so important to Aztec society that it played a central part in their mythology. Just like wheat in much of Europe or rice in most of East Asia, it was the food without which a meal was not a meal. It came in varieties that differed in color, texture, size and prestige, and was eaten as corn tortillas, tamales or \"ātōlli\", maize gruel. The other constants of Aztec food were salt and chili peppers and the basic definition of Aztec fasting was to abstain from these two flavors.\n\nThe other major foods were beans and New World varieties of the grains amaranth (or pigweed), and chia. The combination of maize and these basic foods would have provided the average Aztec a very well-rounded diet without any significant deficiencies in vitamins or minerals. The cooking of maize grains in alkaline solutions, a process called nixtamalization, significantly raised the nutritional value of the common staple.\n\nWater, maize gruels and pulque (\"iztāc octli\"), the fermented juice of the century plant (maguey in Spanish), were the most common drinks, and there were many different fermented alcoholic beverages made from honey, cacti and various fruits. The elite took pride in not drinking pulque, a drink of commoners, and preferred drinks made from cacao, among the most prestigious luxuries available. Favored by rulers, warriors and nobles, they were flavored with chili peppers, honey and a seemingly endless list of spices and herbs.\n\nThe Aztec diet included a variety of fish and wild game: various fowl, pocket gophers, green iguanas, axolotls (a type of water salamander), a type of crayfish called an acocil, and a great variety of insects, larvae and insect eggs. They also domesticated turkeys, duck and dogs as food and at times ate meat from larger wild animals such as deer, but none of these were a major part of their diet. They ate various mushrooms and fungi, including the parasitic corn smut, which grows on ears of corn. Squash (also known as Cucurbita) was very popular and came in many different varieties. Squash seeds, fresh, dried or roasted, were especially popular. Tomatoes, though different from the varieties common today, were often mixed with chili in sauces or as filling for tamales.\n\nEating in Aztec culture could take on a sacred meaning, especially as evidenced in ritual cannibalism. The act of eating another human was deeply connected to the Aztec mythology, in which gods needed to consume the sacrificed flesh and blood of humans to sustain themselves, and the world. One way to look at this is that since human flesh was a food of the gods, it was sacred, and consuming sacred food could sanctify an individual and bring him or her closer to the gods. Further, certain warriors, in their afterlife, were believed to have been turned into butterflies and hummingbirds with the ability to fly back to the realm of the living to feed on nectar. From this, the importance the Aztecs ascribed to the act of eating is clear.\n\nMost sources describe two meals per day, though there is an account of laborers getting three meals, one at dawn, another one at around 9 in the morning and one at around 3 in the afternoon. This is similar to the custom in contemporary Europe, but it is unclear if intake of \"ātōlli\", maize gruel, was considered a meal or not. Drinking a good amount of the thicker kinds of \"ātōlli\" could equal the calories in several corn tortillas, and \"ātōlli\" was consumed on a daily basis by most of the population.\n\nMany accounts exist of Aztec feasts and banquets and the ceremony that surrounded them. Before a meal, servants presented fragrant tobacco tubes and sometimes also flowers with which the guests could rub their head, hands and neck. Before the meal would start each guest would drop a little food on the ground as an offering to the god Tlaltecuhtli. As military prowess was highly praised among the Aztecs, table manners imitated the movement of warriors. The smoking tubes and flowers went from the left hand of the servant to the right hand of the guest and the plate accompanying the smoking tube went from the right hand to the left hand.\n\nThis was an imitation of how a warrior received his atlatl darts and shield. The flowers passed out bore different names depending on how they were handed out; \"sword flowers\" went from left hand to right and \"shield flowers\" went from right hand to left. When eating, guests would hold their individual bowls filled with dipping sauce in the center of the right hand and then dip corn tortillas or tamales (which were served from baskets) with the left. The meal was concluded by serving chocolate, often served in a calabash cup along with a stirring stick.\n\nMen and women were separated at banquets and, though it is not entirely clear from the sources, it seems as if only men drank chocolate. The women would more likely have drunk \"pozolli\" (maize gruel from finely ground maize) or some type of pulque. Rich hosts could often receive guests sitting in rooms around an open courtyard similar to Middle Eastern caravanserai (or \"han\" in Turkish) and senior military men would perform dances. Festivities would begin at midnight and some would drink chocolate and eat hallucinogenic mushrooms so that they could tell about their experiences and visions to the other guests.\n\nRight before dawn singing commenced and offerings were burned and buried in the courtyard to ensure the fortune of the children of the hosts. At dawn the remaining flowers, smoking tubes and food were given to the old and poor that had been invited, or to the servants. As with all other aspects of life the Aztecs stressed the dual nature of all things, and toward the end of the banquet the host would be sternly reminded by his elders of his own mortality and that he should not be overcome with pride.\n\nAztec private feasts included music singing, storytelling, dancing, incense burning, flowers, tobacco, offerings, and gift giving. Aztec feasts were a display of material culture and wealth, notes by Friar Bernardino de Sahagún and Friar Diego Durán describe Aztec feasts as events where \"everything was to be created in abundance.\" Feasts were organized to the point of ritual, there were roles and relationships displayed and reinforced. Hosts needed to meet the obligations of banqueting, in order not to \"offend\" their guests, and guests needed to reinforce the hosts stature. There are multiple important events in Aztec society that called for feasts. Child naming ceremonies involved the ritual calling out of the baby's name, and progressed into a large organized feast. This feast could consist of dressed bird or dog, meat and/or maize tamales, beans, cacao bean, and roasted chili's.\n\nIzcalli child presentation ceremonies were also important, part of the Aztec agricultural calendar - Izcalli was the last \"month\" of the calendar. Every fourth Izcalli celebration included the introduction of children, born during this four year period, to the Aztec community. This feast introduced the child to actions important to their religious life such as: singing, dancing, ceremonial drinking, sacrificial bloodletting, and body modification. The food served during this feast was traditionally spicy. Noted by Sahagun was: \"And the sauce of the tamales was called 'red chili sauce.' and when the good common folk ate, they sat about sweating, they sat about burning themselves. And the tamales stuffed with greens were indeed hot, gleaming hot.\" The wedding process also contained many ceremonies, the parents of a young male, when marriage was desired, had to ask permission of his calmecac school leaders. Part of this process was a feast of tamales, chocolate, and sauces. During the wedding itself there were feasts of pulque, tamales, and turkey meat. Funerary feasts were also common among the wealthy class. Served at these feasts was octli (pulque), chocolate, bird, fruit, seeds, and other foods.\n\nParts of the 260 day ritual calendar of the Aztecs were Veintena. Veintena can be approximated as \"months\" however they are more aptly described as 20 day public ceremony periods. Each 20 day Veintena was a full and complex festival made up of ceremonies dedicated to specific gods and deities of the current Veintena. Regional and local ceremonies differed in deities and methods, from the official state sponsored ones at Tenochtitlan. Food was an important part of Veintena ceremonies, it was both consumed and adorned by priests. It was noted that during the ceremonies honoring Xipe Totec the priests would adorn themselves in arrays of \"butterfly nets, fish banners, ear of maize, coyote heads made of amaranth seed, tortillas, thick rolls covered with a dough of amaranth seeds, toasted maize, red amaranth, and maize stalks with ears of green or tender maize.\" In the ceremonies honoring Mixcoatl, after a \"Great Hunt\" Aztec's would feast on deer, rabbit, and all other animals captured in the hunt. Hunting was also important to celebrations dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli, Aztec boys and young men would hunt for ten days. The products of these hunts would then be turned over to priests, who cooked them in large fire flies\n\nThe main method of preparation was boiling or steaming in two-handled clay pots or jars called \"xoctli\" in Nahuatl and translated into Spanish as \"olla\" (\"pot\"). Ceramics were vital to the cooking process and served at least three major purposes: nixtamal preparation, tamale steaming, and cooking beans, stews, and hot beverages. The xoctli was filled with food and heated over a fire. It could also be used to steam food by pouring a little water into the xoctli and then placing tamales wrapped in maize husks on a light structure of twigs in the middle of the pot.\n\nTortillas, tamales, casseroles and the sauces that went with them were the most common dishes. Chili and salt were both ubiquitous and the most basic meal was usually just corn tortillas that were dipped in chilis that had been ground in a mortar with a little water. Dough could be used to encase meat, sometimes even whole turkeys, before cooking. In major Aztec towns and cities there were vendors that sold street food of all kinds, catering to both the rich and poor. Other than ingredients and prepared food every imaginable type of \"ātōlli\" could be bought, either to quench one's thirst or as an instant meal in liquid form.\n\nWomen, in charge of domestic duties in Aztec societies, were also the cooks. Generally, men did not directly participate in cooking. Based on where cooking tools are usually found, it seems that kitchens were a simple, single-room structure separate from the house itself. Most cooking probably took place on a small triangular hearth in the kitchen.\n\nMost information regarding Aztec cooking tools comes from finding the tools themselves, as depictions of the tools in art are rare, and when they are featured, they aren't particularly prominent or detailed. Luckily, tools were most often made of stone and ceramics and as such can be found in large quantities in good condition for study.\n\nManos and metates were the tool of choice for grinding nixtamalized maize (nixtamal). It was also used to grind sauce ingredients like peppers, though different sets of manos and metates would likely have been used to avoid getting other flavors in maize dough (masa). The metate is a stone slab that can be slightly concave. Nixtamal was placed on top of the metate and the mano, effectively a rough cylindrical stone, was rolled over it, grinding the nixtamal. The mano and metate is a tool that would have been used every day, since ground nixtamal usually goes bad within a day. Ethnographies of twentieth century indigenous communities seem to indicate that women could have spent between four and eight hours a day at a metate grinding nixtamal, but women in a 2007 study at Xaltocan insisted that an experienced woman could grind all she needed for the day in only an hour; regardless, use of a metate for grinding is considered tedious work. The mano and metate remained as the grinding tool of choice in Central Mexico, as it tends to grind finer than European-style mills, and tortillas made from masa ground on a mano and metate are still considered of a higher quality, if much more labor-intensive. However, some argue that the reason women used to and still do grind nixtamal by hand is because it was a way for men to limit the amount of free time women have in an effort to prevent extramarital affairs.\n\nThe molcajete is another grinding tool. It is a bowl made of porous basalt rock, and an accompanying basalt cylinder was used to grind foods into the molcajete. It looks and functions very similarly to a western mortar and pestle. The fact that a molcajete will hold whatever is prepared in it means it would have been ideal for preparing sauces that would spill off the sides of a metate, and molcajetes could also be used as serving vessels.\n\nComales are a type of ceramic griddle with a smooth top and a porous bottom used for cooking various types of tortillas, as well as for non-maize foods like peppers and roasted squash. It's possible that comales could also have been used as makeshift pot lids for the sake of convenience.\n\nThere are several references to frying in the accounts of Spanish chroniclers, but the only specification of the Aztec type of frying appears to be some kind of cooking that was done with syrup, not cooking fat. This is corroborated by the fact that no evidence for large-scale extraction of vegetable oils exist and that no cooking vessels suited for frying have been found by archaeologists.\n\nThe Aztec staple foods included maize, beans and squash to which were often added chilis, nopales and tomatoes, all prominent parts of the Mexican diet to this day. They harvested acocils, a small and abundant crayfish of Lake Texcoco, as well as Spirulina algae, which was made into a sort of cake called tecuitlatl and was rich in flavonoids. Although the Aztecs' diet was mostly vegetarian, the Aztecs consumed insects such as grasshoppers \"chapulín\" (singular) or \"chapulines\" (plural), maguey worm, ants, larvae, etc. Insects have a higher protein content than meat, and even now they are considered a delicacy in some parts of Mexico.\n\nMaize was the single most important staple of the Aztecs. It was consumed at every meal by all social classes, and played a central role in Aztec mythology. To some of the first Europeans, the Aztecs described maize as \"precious, our flesh, our bones\". It came in a vast number of varieties of various sizes, shapes and colors; yellow, reddish, white with stripes of color, black, with or without speckles and a blue-husked variant that was considered to be particularly precious. Other local and regional varieties must have also existed but few were recorded. Maize was revered to such an extent that women blew on maize before putting it into the cooking pot so that it would not fear the fire, and any maize that was dropped on the ground was picked up rather than being wasted. One of the Aztec informants of the Spanish Franciscan missionary and chronicler Bernardino de Sahagún explained the practice in the following way:\n\nA process called nixtamalization was used all over America where maize was the staple. The word is a compound of the Nahuatl words \"nextli\" (\"ashes\") and \"tamalli\" (\"unformed corn dough; tamal\"), and the process is still in use today. Dry maize grain is soaked and cooked in an alkaline solution, usually limewater. This releases the pericarp, the outer hull of the grains and makes the maize easier to grind. The process transforms maize from a simple source of carbohydrates into a considerably more complete nutritional package; it increases the amount of calcium, iron, copper, zinc that are added through the alkalide or the vessel used in the process and niacin, riboflavin and more protein already present in the corn that is not digestible to humans are made available through the process.\n\nThe inhibited growth of certain mycotoxins (toxic fungi) is another benefit of nixtamalization. If the processed maize, the \"nextamalli\", is allowed to ferment, further nutrients, including amino acids such as lysine and tryptophan are made available. Together with beans, vegetables, fruit, chilis and salt nixtamalized corn can form a healthy and diverse diet.\n\nA great number of herbs and spices were available to the Aztecs in seasoning food. Among the most important, chili peppers come in a wide variety of species and cultivars, some domesticated and many of them wild. These included a great range of heat intensity depending on the amount of capsaicin present, with some being mild and others being very piquant. The chilis were often dried and ground for storage and use in cooking, some roasted beforehand to impart different tastes. Flavors varied significantly from one type to another, including sweet, fruity, earthy, smoky, and fiery hot.\n\nNative species of plants used as seasonings produced flavors similar to Old World spices that often proved to be more easily accessible in cooking after the Spanish conquest. Culantro or Mexican coriander provides a much stronger flavor than its Old World parallel, cilantro, and its leaves can be easier to dry. Mexican oregano and Mexican anise likewise produce flavors reminiscent of their Mediterranean counterparts, while allspice has an aroma somewhere in between nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.\n\nThe bark of canella or white cinnamon has a soft, delicate flavor that might have eased the acceptance of the more pungent cinnamon of Ceylon into modern Mexican cuisine. Before the arrival of onions and garlic, subtler but similar wild plants such as Kunth's onion and other southern-ranging species of the genus \"Allium\", as well as the fragrant leaves of garlic vine may have been appropriated. Other flavorings available included mesquite, vanilla, achiote, epazote, hoja santa, popcorn flower, avocado leaf, and other indigenous plants.\n\nMany different alcoholic beverages were made from fermented maize, honey, pineapple, cactus fruit and other plants. The most common was \"octli\" which was made from maguey sap. It is today known as pulque, an Antillean term. It was drunk by all social classes, though some nobles made a point of not downing such a humble beverage. Drinking was tolerated, even for children at some occasions, but becoming intoxicated was not. The penalties could be very stiff, and were stricter for the elite.\n\nThe first transgression of a commoner would be punished by tearing his house down and sending him off to live in the field like an animal. A noble would generally not get a second chance and could be executed for overindulging in alcohol. Getting intoxicated appeared to have been more tolerated for elderly people; Spanish translations of the Codex Mendoza note that there were specific circumstances that allowed the elderly to drink: \n\nIt is shown how, according to the laws and customs of the lords of Mexico, they forbade drunkenness except to those of seventy years of age, man or woman, if such old persons had children or grandchildren. These had license and freedom to use it.\n\nThis did not prevent the occasional tragedy of nobles who became alcoholics and drank themselves into poverty, squalor and an early death. An informant of Sahagún told the sad story of a former tlacateccatl, a general and commander of over 8,000 troops:\n\n\"Ātōle\" (), maize gruel, accounted for a considerable amount of the daily calorie intake. The basic recipe for \"ātōle\" was eight parts water and six parts maize with lime that was cooked until it softened and then ground. The mixture was then boiled until it thickened. There were many variations of \"ātōle\": a mixture of 1/10 maguey syrup made \"nequātōle\"; adding chili ground with salt and tomato would make \"iztac ātōle\"; letting maize dough sour for 4–5 days and then adding more fresh dough with chili and salt would make \"xocoātōle\". Beans, baked corn tortillas with the crust cut off, toasted maize, chia, amaranth and honey could also be added and there was \"pinolli\", ground toasted maize that was carried by travelers in sacks which could be mixed with water on the road for an instant meal.\n\nCacao had immense symbolic value. It was a rare luxury and an import that could not be grown within the boundaries of the Aztec Empire. There are no detailed descriptions of how cacao solids were prepared, but there are a number of allusions to the fact that it was eaten in some form. Cacao beans were among the most valuable commodities and could be used as a form of payment, although of somewhat low value; 80-100 beans could be used to buy a small mantle or a canoe-full of fresh water if one lived on the salty part of the lakes around Tenochtitlan. Nevertheless, beans were frequently counterfeited by filling empty cacao shells with dirt or mud.\n\nCacao was commonly drunk as \"cacahuatl\", \"cacao water\", and was the beverage of warriors and nobles. It was considered a potent intoxicant and something that was drunk with great solemnity and gravity and was described as something \"not drunk unthinkingly\" by the Spanish chronicler Sahagún. Chocolate could be prepared in a huge variety of ways and most of them involved mixing hot or tepid water with toasted and ground cacao beans, maize and any number of flavorers such as chili, honey, vanilla and a wide variety of spices.\n\nThe ingredients were mixed and beaten with a beating stick or aerated by pouring the chocolate from one vessel to another. If the cacao was of high quality, this produced a rich head of foam. The head could be set aside, the drink further aerated to produce another head, which was also set aside and then placed on top of the drink along with the rest of the foam before serving.\n\nThe Aztecs stressed moderation in all aspects of life. European authors and chroniclers were often impressed by what they perceived as exemplary frugality, simplicity and moderation. Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, the bishop of Puebla and viceroy of New Spain in the 1640s reported:\n\nThe primary meaning of an Aztec fast was to abstain from salt and chilis and all members of Aztec society engaged in fasting to some extent. There were no regular exceptions from the fast, something that shocked the first Europeans who came into contact with the Aztecs. Though fasting was common in Europe, there were permanent exceptions for the women and small children, the sick or frail and the elderly. Before the New Fire ceremony, which occurred every 52 years, some priests fasted for a whole year; the other priests 80 days and lords 8 days.\n\nCommoners engaged in fasts, but less rigorously. There was also a permanent contingent of fasters in Tehuacan. Along with various ascetic rigors like sleeping on a stone pillow, they fasted for periods of four years on one 50-gram corn tortilla (about 2 ounces) per day. The only respite came every 20 days, when they were allowed to eat whatever they wanted.\n\nEven rulers such as Moctezuma were expected to cut down on their otherwise luxurious lifestyle and did so with considerable conviction and effort. At times he abstained from luxuries and sex with women and ate only cakes of \"michihuauhtli\" and seeds of amaranth or goosefoot. The lord's chocolate was also replaced with water mixed from parched bean powder. This can be contrasted with the fasts of many European nobles and clergy that, while obeying the letter of the religious regulation by replacing meat and animal products with fish, were still luxurious feasts in their own right.\n\nDuring the fourteenth month, called Quecholli, ceremonies in honor of Mixcoatl (Cloud serpent, god of the hunt), there would be a large hunt as part of the ritual. To prepare for the hunt Aztecs would fast for five days. The fasting was done, according to Sahagun, \"for the deer, so that it would be a successful hunt.\"\n\nDuring the celebrations of the god Tezcatlipoca, his priests fasted for ten, five, or seven days continuously before the main feasts. They were known as \"those who do penance.\"\n\nDuring celebrations of Huitzilopoctli it was noted by Friar Duran: \"I have been assured that they became so weak because of the terrible eight-day fast that for another eight days they were not themselves, nor were they satisfied with eating. Many became gravely ill, and the lives of many pregnant women were in danger.\"\n\nDuring festivals in honor of Chicomecoatl, there would be a drastic back and forth of gorging and fasting. So much so that people would become ill.\n\nBernal Diaz del Castillo comments on how the ruler of Tenochtitlan was served food:\n\nHis cooks had more than thirty styles of dishes made according to their fashion and usage, and they put them on small low clay braziers so that they would not get cold ... if it was cold they made him a fire of glowing coals made from the bark of certain trees ... the odor of the bark ... was most fragrant ... they put the tablecloths of white fabric ... They served him on Cholula pottery, some red and some black ... and from time to time they brought him some cups of fine gold, with a certain drink made of cacao.\n\nSahagun provides a list of the different types of tlaquetzalli, a chocolate drink served to Aztec lords: \n\nThe ruler was served his chocolate, with which he finished [his repast] - green, made of tender cacao; honeyed chocolate made with ground-up dried flowers - with green vanilla pods; bright red chocolate; orange-colored chocolate; rose-colored chocolate; black chocolate; white chocolate.\"\n\nAztec expansion was targeted in ways to gain or maintain access to foodstuffs need for ceremony and everyday life. The leader's ability to acquire food needed for ritual was important for his political success.\n\nThe Aztecs practiced ritualistic cannibalism. Victims, usually prisoners of war, were sacrificed in public on top of temples and pyramids by cutting out their hearts. The bodies were then thrown down to the ground where they were dismembered. The pieces were then distributed to the elite, which were mostly warriors and priests. The meat was consumed in the form of stews flavored only with salt and eaten with corn tortillas, but without the otherwise ubiquitous chili.\n\nThe veintena Tlacaxipehualiztli was one of intense human sacrifice, it was noted by Sahagun that \"it was the time when all captives died, all those taken, all those who were made captive, the men, the women, all the children.\" It began with the sacrifice of captured warriors, the flesh of the sacrificed warriors would be taken to the residence of the Aztec who had captured the warrior. The capturer was forbidden to feast on the flesh of the sacrificed, however his family would eat it. A stew called tlacatlaolli was prepared out of dried maize and into each serving would be placed a piece of the flesh of the captive.\n\nIn the late 1970s the anthropologist Michael Harner suggested that the Aztecs had resorted to large-scale, organized cannibalism to make up for a supposed protein deficiency in the diet. This idea gained limited support from some scholars, but has been shown to be based on unfounded assumptions about eating habits, agriculture and demographics, making it a highly unlikely scenario.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10933466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10933466", "title": "Oba (ruler)", "text": "Oba (ruler)\n\nOba means ruler in the Yoruba and \nBini languages of West Africa. Kings in Yorubaland, a region which is in the modern republics of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, make use of it as a pre-nominal \nhonourific. Examples of Yoruba bearers include Oba Ogunwusi of Ile-Ife, Oba Adeyemi of Oyo and Oba Akiolu of Lagos. An example of a Bini bearer is Oba Ewuare II of Benin. \n\nThe title is distinct from that of Oloye, which is itself used in like fashion by subordinate titleholders in the contemporary Yoruba chieftaincy system.\n\nThe Yoruba chieftaincy system can be divided into four separate ranks: royal chiefs, noble chiefs, religious chiefs and common chiefs. The royals are led by the obas, who sit at the apex of the hierarchy and serve as the fons honorum of the entire system. They are joined in the class of royal chiefs by the titled dynasts of their royal families. The three other ranks, who traditionally provide the membership of a series of privy councils, sects and guilds, oversee the day-to-day administration of the Yoruba traditional states and are led by the Iwarefas, the Arabas and the titled elders of the kingdoms' constituent families.\n\nThere are two different kinds of Yoruba monarchs: The kings of Yoruba clans, which are often simply networks of related towns (For example, the oba of the Egba bears the title \"Alake of Egbaland\" because his ancestral seat is the Ake quarter of Abeokuta, hence the title Alake, which is Yoruba for \"Man of Ake\". The Oyo oba, meanwhile, bears the title \"Alaafin\", which means \"Man of the palace\") and the kings of individual Yoruba towns, such as that of Iwo - a town in Osun State - who bears the title \"Olu'wo\" (Olu of Iwo, lit. \"Lord of Iwo\").\n\nThe first generation towns of the Yoruba homeland, which encompasses large swathes of the said countries of Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, are those with obas who generally wear beaded crowns; the rulers of many of the 'second generation' settlements are also often obas. Those that remain and those of the third generation tend to only be headed by the holders of the title \"Baale\" (lit. \"Head of the Clan\"), who do not wear crowns and who are, at least in theory, the reigning viceroys of people who do.\n\nAll of the subordinate members of the Yoruba aristocracy, both traditional titleholders and honorary ones, use the pre-nominal \"Oloye\" (lit. \"Owner of a title\", also appearing as \"Ijoye\") in the way that kings and queens regnant use 'Oba'. It is also often used by princes and princesses in colloquial situations, though the title that is most often ascribed to them officially is \"Omoba\" (lit. \"Child of a Monarch\", sometimes rendered alternatively as \"Omo'ba\", \"Omooba\" and \"Omo-Oba\"). The wives of kings, princes and chiefs of royal background usually make use of the title \"Olori\" (the equivalent of \"Princess Consort\", otherwise spelled \"Oloori\"), though some of the wives of dynastic rulers prefer to be referred to as \"Ayaba\" (the equivalent of \"Queen Consort\"). The wives of the non-royal chiefs, when themselves titleholders in their own right, tend to use the honorific \"Iyaloye\" (lit. \"Lady who owns a title\") in their capacities as married chieftesses.\n\nThe bead-embroidered crown with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, \"The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience.\"\n\nThe role of the oba has diminished with the coming of colonial and democratic institutions. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the Oyo warrior chiefs and palace officials in the medieval period, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the empire. In Yorubaland, like in many other areas of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, chieftaincy titles are mostly given to successful men and women from within a given sub-sectional territory, although it is not unheard of for a person from elsewhere to receive one. The titles also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the individual oba that awarded them, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional investiture ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official governments of any of the three countries if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local media and enter the public domain thereafter. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. Ceremonies such as this, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, are two of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of West Africa.\n\nAs a sacred ruler, the oba is traditionally regarded by the Yoruba as the ex officio chief priest of all of the Orisha sects in his or her domain. Although most of the day-to-day functions of this position are delegated in practice to such figures as the Arabas, certain traditional rites of the Yoruba religion can only be performed by the oba, and it is for this reason that the holders of the title are often thought of as being religious leaders in addition to being politico-ceremonial monarchs.\n\n"}

To garnish it, powdered cinnamon is spread on top of the finished natilla. Natilla is found all throughout the Christmas season and usually stores sell pre-made natilla; but one of the best known Christmas traditions in Colombia is making natilla in an improvised campfire in the streets or home patios.\n\nThis term is used in Peru, especially the city of Piura, a spread made of milk and chancaca that is boiled until it is thick and the sugar has caramelized to a rich brown color. The Peruvian confection is arguably more similar to Spanish natilla except that it is somewhat thicker and has no eggs. \nIn Mexico, Natillas are also found and resemble a thicker version of the dessert drink called \"Atole.\"\n\nIn Costa Rica, the term is used for a sour cream-like dairy product used as a condiment with a variety of dishes. The product is homogenized and pasteurized milk with a lower fat content (about 12%) than normal sour cream, some brands add salt to the cream.\n\nNatilla in Cuba and Puerto Rico is classified as a cold custard dessert. Natilla is made with cornstarch, vanilla, sugar, eggs, lemon zest, cinnamon, milk, and evaporated milk. Typically served on Christmas in small cups with cinnamon sprinkled on top. In Puerto Rico Natilla can be bought all year around in supermarkets and convenient stores as a prepackaged powder with just the requirement of heating with milk. A less sweet version, that is served for breakfast in Puerto Rico, is made with honey and more milk and, once done, is topped with fruit and cinnamon.\n\n"}

As explained in The Oxford Companion to Food, it was a staple food for many centuries. The word \"pottage\" comes from the same Old French root as \"potage\", which is a dish of more recent origin.\n\nPottage ordinarily consisted of various ingredients easily available to serfs and peasants, and could be kept over the fire for a period of days, during which time some of it could be eaten, and more ingredients added. The result was a dish that was constantly changing. Pottage consistently remained a staple of the poor's diet throughout most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. When wealthier people ate pottage, they would add more expensive ingredients such as meats. The pottage that these people ate was much like modern-day soups. This is similar to the Welsh cawl, which is a broth, soup or stew often cooked on and off for days at a time over the fire in a traditional inglenook.\n\nIn Nigeria the words pottage and porridge are synonymous, and such foods are consumed as a main meal. Nigerian yam pottage/porridge includes tomatoes and other culinary vegetables along with the yam. It may also have fish and/or other meat.\n\nIn the King James Bible translation of the story of Jacob and Esau in the Book of Genesis, Esau, being famished, sold his birthright (the rights of the eldest son) to his twin brother Jacob in exchange for a meal of \"bread and pottage of lentiles\" (). This incident is the origin of the phrase a \"mess of pottage\" (which is not in any Biblical text) to mean a bad bargain involving short-term gain and long-term loss.\n\nPottage was typically boiled for several hours until the entire mixture took on a homogeneous texture and flavour; this was intended to break down complex starches and to ensure the food was safe for consumption. It was often served, when possible, with bread.\n\nIn Middle English thick pottages (\"stondyng\") made with cereals, shredded meat, seasoned with spices and sometimes thickened with egg yolks and bread crumbs were called by various names like \"brewet\", \"egerdouce\", \"mortrew\", \"mawmenee\", \"blancmange\" and \"blance dessore\". Thinner pottages were said to be \"ronnyng\". Frumenty was a pottage made with fresh cleaned wheat grain that was boiled until it burst, allowed to cool, then boiled with broth and either cow milk or almond milk. The pottage was thickened with egg yolk and flavored with sugar and spices.\n\nPottage had long been a staple of the English diet. During the Middle Ages it was usually made with wheat, barley, rye, or oats. Native American cuisine also had a similar dish, but it was made with maize rather than the traditional European grain varieties. An early 17th century British recipe for pottage with made by boiling mutton and oatmeal with violet leaves, endive, chicory, strawberry leaves, spinach, langdebeefe, marigold flowers, scallions and parsley.\n\nIn the cuisine of New England, pottage began as boiled grain, vegetables, seasonings and meat, fowl or fish. This simple staple of early American cuisine eventually evolved into the chowders and baked beans typical of New England's cuisine. A version of \"scotch barley broth\" is attested to in the 18th century colonial recipe collection called \"Mrs Gardiner's Family Receipts\". Indian succotash, sometimes called \"pondomenast\" or \"Indian pottage\" was made with boiled corn and, when available, meat like venison, bear, moose, otter, raccoon or beaver. Dried fish like shad, eel, or herring could be used in place of the meat. Kidney beans were sometimes mixed into Indian pottage, along with roots like Jerusalem artichoke, pumpkin, squash. Ground nuts like acorns, chestnuts or walnuts were used to thicken the pottage.\n\n\n"}

The use of the word \"ox\" in this context is a legacy of nomenclature; no specialized stock of beef animals are used and tails may come from bovines other than oxen. It is believed by some that oxtail soup was invented in Spitalfields in London in the seventeenth century by French Huguenot and Flemish immigrants, from the tails of animals. Different versions of oxtail soup exist: Korean, Chinese, a fried/barbecued oxtail combined with soup variation which is a popular dish in Indonesia where it is called as \"sop buntut\". An ethnic dish of the American South which traces its lineage back to the pre-revolutionary war era, and a thick, rich, gravy-like soup popular in the United Kingdom since the 18th century. Creole oxtail soup is made from a tomato base with oxtails, potatoes, green beans, corn, mirepoix, garlic, and herbs and spices.\n\nThough translated literally as \"oxtail soup\" (牛尾汤 \"Niúwěi tāng\"), this version of the dish is somewhere between a soup and a stew. One of the defining characteristics of oxtail soup is that it contains a large mass of solid ingredients, rather than ingredients that have been diced or shredded as is the norm with Chinese soup. Chunks of oxtail, potato, carrots, cabbage, tomato, and mushrooms are mixed in water, and salted to taste. The mixture should be heated at a slow boil, to allow time for the ingredients to release their flavors. In particular, the tomatoes and potatoes should largely disintegrate into the water, giving the broth a reddish-orange coloration and thickening it. As to be expected, oils from the oxtail lend most of the flavor. The soup is served with all of the ingredients.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, oxtail soup () is a popular dish. It is made of slices of fried or barbecued oxtail, served with vegetable soup with rich but clear beef broth. It contains frogs, cocoa beans, boiled potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, leek, celery, and fried shallots. Indonesian sop buntut is seasoned with shallot, garlic and native spices such as black pepper, nutmeg, and clove. A relatively new variant is called \"Sop Buntut Goreng\" (fried oxtail soup), where the oxtail is seasoned, fried and served dry, the soup is served in separate bowl. The dish is commonly eaten with rice and accompanied with sambal, sweet soy sauce and lime juice. Certain restaurant has specialized on oxtail soup, among a famous one is Bogor Café in Hotel Borobudur in Central Jakarta.\n\nKorean oxtail soup, called \"kkori-gomtang\" (), is a type of \"gomguk\" (beef bone soup). It is colloquially known as \"bone soup\". The broth is made with raw oxtail, garlic, salt, black pepper, green onions and other typical Korean flavors. The soup must be simmered at low heat for several hours to soften the meat and make the broth. During this time, the layer of fat must be regularly skimmed from the surface of the pot and discarded. The final result is a rich beef broth with a garlic taste and bits of soft meat.\n\nA canned condensed oxtail soup was formerly available from the Campbell Soup Company.\nOxtail is a popular variety of Heinz soups in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}

{"id": "10977690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10977690", "title": "Harmonie", "text": "Harmonie\n\nHarmonie is a German word that, in the context of the history of music, designates an ensemble of wind instruments (usually about five to eight players) employed by an aristocratic patron, particularly during the Classical era of the 18th century. The Harmonie would be employed for outdoor or recreational music, or as a wind section of an orchestra. Music composed for Harmonie is often called \"Harmoniemusik\".\n\nHorace Fitzpatrick writes (reference below):\nFrom about 1756 onward the Emperor [in Vienna] and the Austrian nobles kept house bands called \"Harmonien\", usually made of pairs of oboes, horns, bassoons, and after about 1770, clarinets. These wind groups formed part of the household musical staff, and provided serenade for banquets and garden parties. Joseph II kept a crack \"Harmonie\" for his private delectation, drawn from the principal wind players of the Imperial opera. His successor Franz II carried on this practice.\nAccording to Haydn biographer Rosemary Hughes:\n\"Feldharmonie\" or simply \"Harmonie,\" was the wind band, maintained by most noblemen even when they could not afford a larger orchestra, for performing at hunting parties and other outdoor entertainments.\"\nRoger Hellyer, writing in the \"Grove Dictionary\" notes that while the Harmonie generally had an aristocratic patron, the same music was sometimes also played by street musicians. A letter by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to his father Leopold (3 November 1781) noted that street musicians had serenaded him with his own composition, the wind serenade K. 375.\n\nIn English, the word \"Harmonie\" exists only as a technical term of historical musicology. In other European languages, such as Dutch, French and German, the term may also refer to a modern wind band. The expression , used in Dutch, is the abbreviation and contraction of \"Harmonie\" (concert band), \"Fanfare\" (fanfare band and/or fanfare orchestra, usually with a marching band connotation) and \"Brassband\" (brass band), an umbrella term for all types of wind bands, including the types with additional non-wind instruments such as the typical battery of a marching band.\n\nThe aristocrats who employed a Harmonie would often also maintain a small orchestra, numerically dominated by, or consisting entirely of, the string section. When members of the Harmonie participated in performances with such orchestras, it became possible for the composer to enrich the musical texture with wind parts, without increasing the payroll cost of his patron. Thus, \"Harmonie\" came also to designate the wind section of a small orchestra. Of this practice, Fitzpatrick writes, \"It was [Franz II's \"Harmonie\"] who made up the wind section in Beethoven's orchestra of 1800 [at the premiere of the composer's First Symphony].\"\n\nJoseph Haydn's Mass in B flat major, (H. 22/14, 1802) is nicknamed the \"Harmoniemesse\", because (unlike the other masses Haydn wrote during this time) it includes parts for a whole wind section, thanks to the recent reinstatement of these instruments in the musical establishment of Prince Nikolaus Esterházy II.\n\nThe 18th-century German expression \"auf Harmonie setzen\" (: set onto Harmonie) means arranging a piece of music for performance by a Harmonie. For instance \"Der Messias\", Mozart's arrangement of Handel's \"Messiah\", included that several movements became \"auf Harmonie gesetzt\".\n\nDuring the historical period of the Harmonie, the ensemble gradually grew in size. Hellyer (2006) suggests that during the early period, in the 1750s, a Harmonie could consist of just five instruments (two oboes, two horns, and one bassoon), though a second bassoon could be included as well. The Harmonie compositions of Haydn and Mozart (see below) all use at least six instruments.\n\nA later expansion of the Harmonie can be traced with the accession of Joseph II to the throne of the Austrian Empire in 1780. Joseph expanded music-making at his court in a number of ways, including the introduction of a Harmonie, as noted above. This Harmonie consisted of eight players, with two clarinets added to the traditional two oboes, two horns, and two bassoons. Other nobles then followed the Emperor's lead. \n\nThe Emperor's Harmonie included some distinguished players, notably the clarinettist Anton Stadler, who was the inspiration for a number of important works by Mozart. It also included Anton's younger brother Johann, as well as the oboist Johann Went, a composer of over 80 works for Harmonie, and oboist/composer Josef Triebensee.\n\nThe Harmonie continued as a lively musical tradition until the Napoleonic Wars forced aristocrats to retrench financially, cutting down on the number of musicians they employed. The tradition had been largely abandoned by the mid-1830s.\n\nSome of Joseph Haydn's early works, called \"divertimenti\" or \"Feldpartien\", were written for the Harmonie of his first full-time employer, Count Morzin around 1760. Haydn became Vice-Kapellmeister for the Prince Paul Anton Esterházy in 1761, which was the same year that the Prince established a six-member Harmonie; Hellyer suggests that some of Haydn's early works for Harmonie were intended for this ensemble.\n\nMozart also wrote for Harmonie. As a teenager traveling in Italy, he wrote the early Divertimenti K. 186 and K. 166 (1773); see Divertimenti for ten winds (Mozart). He wrote further divertimenti between 1775 and 1777, while working at the Salzburg court (K. 213, 240, 252, 253, 270).\n\nSome time after his move to Vienna (1781), Mozart wrote his most extended work for Harmonie, the Serenade in B flat, K. 361 (a.k.a. \"Gran Partita\"). This is for an amplified wind ensemble of 13 instruments (two oboes, two clarinets, two basset horns, four (French) horns, two bassoons, and a string bass). His E flat serenade of 1781, K. 375, is written for a Harmonie consisting of clarinets, bassoons and horns, curiously mismatching what the new Emperor had arranged as his Harmonie; Hellyer suggests Mozart, who was seeking a job at court at the time, was misinformed. Mozart later revised the work to include two oboe parts.\n\nPerhaps the weightiest of all music for Harmonie is Mozart's Serenade No. 12 for winds in C minor, K. 388, written in 1782 for Joseph II's eight-player Harmonie. Hellyer calls it \"a curiously sombre and powerful work which often conveys a mood of dramatic intensity totally alien to the informal background music normally associated with the serenade type.\"\n\nAt the banquet in the finale of \"Don Giovanni\", Mozart has a \"Harmonie\" perform parts from \"Una cosa rara\" by Vicente Martín y Soler, \"I due litiganti\" by Giuseppe Sarti and the aria \"Non piu andrai\" from his own \"The Marriage of Figaro\". The scoring is for the full eight-part Harmonie, two each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns.\n\n\n"}

She was the first of this genre of writers in Australia.\n\nHer early recipes encouraged Australian housewives to alter the Australian staple of \"meat and three vegetables\" and to be creative with food. She 'discovered' international cuisine from exotic places such as Spain, Italy, India and China and as Cookery Editor, 'brought these into Australian homes through her articles in the \"Woman's Day\" magazine'.\n\nFulton realised that chefs who did television shows tended to lose their audience. Accordingly, she remained a writer who regularly appeared only as a 'guest' on various TV shows.\n\nFulton was born in Nairn, Scotland in 1924. When she was three, her parents emigrated to Australia, settling in Glen Innes, New South Wales.\n\nShe began as a cooking teacher at the Overseas Corporation in 1947 and was later promoted to sales manager where she was 'partially responsible for the introduction of the pressure cooker to Australia'.\n\nIn 1954, Fulton, then a 'home economist for a leading firm of cereal manufacturers', gave a talk on 'cooking with ready-to-eat cereals'. She told the audience that 'with more wives and mothers working, speed and ease in food preparation is a \"must\"'. She continued 'Many women have no training in homemaking, and packaged and ready-prepared foods, like cereals, cake, pastry and biscuit mixes, canned and frozen foods, make life easier'. A selection of 'hot muffins made with bran' were handed out and Fulton told the listeners that 'These are quick and easy to make and most economical'.\n\nIn 1956, over four days, Fulton provided French cooking demonstrations. Each day was organised with a different 'well-known French hostess, resident in Sydney' who 'planned a menu, contributed the recipes, helped with the cooking, and arranged the table setting'.\n\nFulton began to appear in advertisements in the late 1950s. She promoted 'Johnson's Glo-coat' floor polish and 'Johnson's Pride' surface polish from her 'well appointed Sydney kitchen' in March 1957. Later that year readers of \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" were told 'Margaret Fulton, expert Home Economist' believed Sellotape 'is so dependable' in a full page colour ad, which also offered Fulton's handy hints for using the product such as sealing plastic bags 'for deep-freezing foods' and binding pot handles. In 1959, Fulton told readers she used Sellotape 'each week for sticking my hundreds of recipe clippings into reference books'.\n\nProspective buyers of Woman's Day magazine in July 1964 were promised an '8-page liftout' from Fulton who was known for her Tuesday 'cookery class' at Sydney's 'Bistro'. Fulton's regular contributions continued throughout the decade with 1968's 'lift-out full colour' recipe guide to Italian food which was described by the magazine as 'our most exciting... ever!'.\n\nFulton's book, \"The Margaret Fulton Cookbook\", was published by Paul Hamlyn in 1968 and was an instant success. By 1978 it had sold 'more than two-thirds of a million copies'.\n\nShe returned to the Italian theme with the release of her 'Italian Cookbook' in 1973. \"The Canberra Times\" said the recipes were 'simple, tested... and where necessary adapted to suit the local scene' however Fulton was 'able to add authenticity to the book by taking a trip to Italy and checking the fare at first hand'. The author was quoted as recommending that cooks 'look for the specialty ingredients in a good delicatessen or gourmet section of a large retail stores. Use only the best quality Italian olive oil and when using grating cheese like Parmesan or Romano, buy it in wedges and grate it as you need it.'\n\nIn October 1973, Fulton was appointed to the Federal Government's 'Interim Commission on Consumer Standards' which was formed to 'reach as many groups as possible' and 'find the areas where action' on standards was 'most urgent'.\n\nInterviewed in 1975, she provided Italian and 'Chinese style' recipes for readers and included in her advice for 'young people setting up home for the first time' was that they should 'buy a couple of really good saucepans and, if possible, invest in an iron oven casserole... they last a lifetime and these days are so attractive that they can be taken to the table'.\n\nFollowing on from the popularity of late 1970s BBC television drama series The Duchess of Duke Street, set in London between 1900 and 1925, Fulton had a primetime TV cooking show of 5-minute episodes based on recipes from the era.\n\nIn 1979, her interest in Chinese cuisine led to her leading a planned '23-day gourmet food tour' which would include 'the finest restaurants' of Canton, Shanghai, Tsinan, Tsingtao, Kunming and Peking. Fulton said the tour would also visit 'historical sites... communes, universities, factories and handcraft institutes'. She also hoped there would be 'a chance to see acupuncture procedures in a Chinese hospital'.\n\nFulton was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours 'In recognition of service to the media as a journalist and writer in the field of cookery'.\n\nFulton's encouragement of Chinese cuisine was recognised as a contributor to the development of Sydney's Chinatown district where 'few non-Chinese' ventured 'before the 1950s'. Fulton was one of the writers who 'began serving up Chinese recipes to Menzies' Australia' (recalling the era of Robert Menzies as Prime Minister from 1949 to 1966) and, as a result, Chinatown's 'few eating houses were seen as a welcome alternative to the spartan cuisine of the times'.\n\nIn 1998, Fulton was added to the list of 100 Australian Living Treasures by the National Trust of Australia. The same year, a packaged meals business venture 'Margaret Fulton's kitchen' which Fulton had been involved with her daughter and fellow chef Suzanne Gibbs and 'Sydney food luminary' Anders Ousback, failed.\n\nIn 2006 The Bulletin named Fulton in their list of 'The 100 most influential Australians'. In the citation they described her as someone who 'changed the way Australians ate at home'. She is, they wrote, 'Australia's original domestic goddess. No cookery writer since can claim her blanket influence... Fulton turned us into foodies.'\n\nInterviewed by \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" in 2009, she said:\n\"Scarcely a week passes when I'm not invited to speak at a food industry or fundraising function and I always try to accept. At my age, being asked to pass on what I've learned is a pleasure and a privilege.\"\n\n\nFulton has written many books, including:\n\n\n"}

It is widely known as Persian Nougat in American and European countries.\n\nThe Persian word \"Gaz\" is associated with \"gaz-angebin\" which translates to 'Honey of Gaz', in reference to a species of Tamarisk, \"T. gallica\" that is native to the Zagros mountain range located to the west of Isfahan. Gaz is one of the most popular souvenirs of Isfahan. The raw material for this famous sweet is manna which is obtained around the city.\nThe history of making Gaz in Isfahan backs to 450 years ago which was made in the different types of flour, bread, including pistachios, almonds and chocolate in traditional and industrial workshops.\nGaz manna is the root of a plant which is called bush or Gaz tree. The height of this mountain tree reaches a height of two meters and it usually grows in good weather in the mountains of Bakhtiari and Khansar.\nThe product of this tree becomes ready to harvest in the late summer and the shiny and yellow grains come out in the stems like millet. At this time, the owners of the trees must harvest them before the autumnal rains.http://en.rasekhoon.net/article/show/1087384/isfahan-gaz/\n\nThe sweet, milky honey (angebin) found on the Gaz plant is associated with \"manna\", a food mentioned in the religious texts of the Abrahamic religions. The sticky white substance is formed from honeydew, which is exuded from the anus of the nymph of a psyllid insect, either \"Cyamophila astragalicola\" or \"C. dicora\", in its final instar, which live on plants of \"Astragalus adscendens\", and is collected annually and is combined with other ingredients including pistachio or almond kernels, rosewater and egg white. Modern versions of gaz may not contain gaz of Khunsar and may use sugar and corn syrup as substitutes for psyllid manna.\n\nThe traditional way to serve gaz is in round pieces that are about 2 inches in diameter and up to 1/2-inch thick. A modern presentation is to serve the nougat cut into smaller rectangles. Depending on the ingredients mixed in, gaz can have a subtle rose flavor, a nutty taste, or a savory and pungent profile. It can be white, or it can become another color because of the addition of spices (such as saffron) or nuts.\n\nCelebrations such as Nowruz, the Persian New Year, feature gaz. During the Nowruz holiday, family and friends visit each other's homes and, typically, the host offers fruits and sweets to their guests. Served with sherbet or tea, gaz is a favorite delicacy and a much-appreciated gift as it helps to ensure that a household will have ample snacks to serve all holiday visitors.\n\n"}

This horological technology was derived from earlier Indian clocks and Chinese clocks. \n\nIn China clock escapement mechanism was invented by the polymath and Buddhist monk Yi Xing as well as the hydraulic powered waterwheel and water clock in the mechanically-driven and rotated equatorial armillary sphere of the polymaths Zhang Heng and Ma Jun. The Elephant clock had some design differences compared to earlier Indian and Chinese clocks and the various elements of the clock are in the housing (howdah) on top of the elephant. \n\nAl-Jazari upon finishing the development and construction of his Elephant clock wrote: \"The elephant represents the Indian and African cultures, the two dragons represents Chinese culture, the phoenix represents Persian culture, the water work represents Greek culture, and the turban represents Islamic culture\" signifying the multicultural mentality of the intellectual Al-Jazari.\n\nIn addition to its mechanical innovations, the clock itself is seen as an early example of multiculturalism represented in technology.\n\nThe timing mechanism is based on a water-filled basin hidden inside the elephant. In the bucket is a deep bowl floating in the water, but with a small hole in the centre. The bowl takes half an hour to fill through this hole. In the process of sinking, the bowl pulls a string attached to a see-saw mechanism in the tower on top of the elephant. This releases a ball that drops into the mouth of a serpent, causing the serpent to tip forward, which pulls the sunken bowl out of the water via strings. At the same time, a system of strings causes a figure in the tower to raise either the left or right hand and the mahout (elephant driver at the front) to hit a drum. This indicates a half or full hour. Next, the snake tips back. The cycle then repeats, as long as balls remain in the upper reservoir to power the emptying of the bowl.\n\nIn the mechanism, a humanoid automaton strikes the cymbal and a mechanical bird chirps, like in the later cuckoo clock.\n\nAnother innovative feature of the clock was how it recorded the passage of temporal hours, which meant that the rate of flow had to be changed daily to match the uneven length of days throughout the year. To accomplish this, the clock had two tanks. The top tank was connected to the time indicating mechanisms and the bottom was connected to the flow control regulator. At daybreak, the tap was opened and water flowed from the top tank to the bottom tank via a float regulator that maintained a constant pressure in the receiving tank.\n\nSeveral modern reproductions of the Elephant Clock have been created by the 1001 Inventions organisation. These reproductions are featured as part of the 1001 Inventions educational science shows that have been touring around the world since 2006. During a visit to the London Science Museum in January 2010, BBC journalist Nick Higham described the five metre high, working Elephant Clock replica produced by 1001 Inventions as \"spectacular\".\n\nA modern full-size working reproduction can be found as a centerpiece in the Ibn Battuta Mall, a shopping mall in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Another working reproduction can be seen outside the Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle, Château des Monts, in Le Locle, Switzerland. Another can be found in the Museum of Science and Technology in Islam in the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n"}

Atlantic puffins breed in the islands in large numbers, notably on Mykines, and from July, after the breeding season, it is legal to catch them for food. Puffins are also widely harvested and eaten in Iceland, especially in the Westmen Isles.\n\nIn the summer months, the Faroes are home to about five million seabirds, including two million breeding pairs, with a biomass of 3,000 tonnes. Seabird harvesting in the Faroe Islands has been carried out sustainably for at least 300 years, historically forming a very important component of the Faroese diet. Bag limits are now set each year to maintain the harvest of tens of thousands of birds annually. Ownership of the areas where puffins, and other harvested seabirds, breed and are caught, may be by individuals or communally by villages. Puffins and fulmars are the most important species harvested, but guillemots and gannets (and, historically, other species) are also taken.\n\nPuffins are caught by the traditional method of \"fleyging\". This is catching the birds in flight by actively netting them with the hand-wielded \"fleygingarstong\", a 3.6 metre-long pole with a small net at the end suspended between two rods, somewhat like a very long lacrosse stick. Fleyging is usually carried out on a cliff-top from a \"fleygises\", or fleyging-seat, built of stones in a small depression so that the fleyger is concealed from overflying puffins. The puffins then have their necks snapped or their heads simply pulled off. Several hundred puffins may be caught in this way by one person in a day.\n\nPuffins are culturally important in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese word for puffin is \"\"lundi\"\". A popular and much loved Faroese cartoon character is the bespectacled puffin known as Ludvik Lundi.\n\nThe birds are traditionally prepared by being skinned, the feet, wings and internal organs removed, soaked in a simple marinade of saltwater, milk or ale, then browned in a pan or boiled. They are sometimes smoked before being cooked. More recently other methods, such as grilling the breasts, are being used. Puffins may also be stuffed with sweet cake dough, raisins and spices, before being boiled or roasted.\n\n"}

The meat is prepared in different ways, it can be boiled or fried fresh, it can be stored in either dry salt (\"turrsaltað\") or in very salty water (\"lakasaltað\"), it can be frozen and later prepared, or it can be hung up outdoors in order to dry. When it is hung out to dry, it is cut in long slices (\"grindalikkja\"), and then hung under a roof, to shield it from the rain. The blubber can also be prepared in different ways, boiled, salted or dried, but not fried. Dried blubber can also be eaten together with dried fish, as shown on the photo. The whale meat has a very dark color, almost black.\n\nThe tradition to eat whale meat and blubber dates back many centuries, whaling was mentioned in the Faroese part of the Norwegian Gulating-law dating back to 1298. The islands lie very isolated in the North Atlantic. In the old days, food supplies from other countries were sparse forcing them to manage with what ever nature had to offer. The food resources came from household animals like sheep, cows, geese, chicken and ducks, and from wild animals like sea birds and from the sea they got various kinds of fish and from time to time also whale meat and blubber. \n\nThere are statistics from the whaling in the Faroe Islands which dates back to 1584, which are probably the oldest statistics for a specific kind of hunting. The statistics are regarding the hunting of pilot whales and døgling. The pilot whale hunting has even been mentioned in the Viking Ages, after year 1000, when Sigmundur Brestisson brought Christianity to the Faroe Islands, and the Faroe Islands became a Norwegian territory, they had to pay tax to the King of Norway, and therefore they made statistics about every whale killing in the Faroe Islands. Later the islands came to be a Danish territory, and the statistics were used for paying tax to the King of Denmark. The statistics are reliable from 1709 up to today, the statistics from the years where the Gable family (Christoffer Gabel (1617-1673) and his son Frederik Gable) ruled from 1642 to 1708 (Gablatíðin) is not so reliable according to the Danish/Faroese scientist Dorete Bloch, as there are only a few documents about whale killings from this period.

{"id": "11048391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11048391", "title": "Hermetic Qabalah", "text": "Hermetic Qabalah\n\nHermetic Qabalah () is a Western esoteric tradition involving mysticism and the occult. It is the underlying philosophy and framework for magical societies such as the Golden Dawn, Thelemic orders, mystical-religious societies such as the Builders of the Adytum and the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross, and is a precursor to the Neopagan, Wiccan and New Age movements.The Hermetic Qabalah is the basis for Qliphothic Qabala as studied by left hand path orders, such as the Typhonian Order.\n\nOccult Hermetic Qabalah arose alongside and united with the Christian Cabalistic involvement in the European Renaissance, becoming variously Esoteric Christian, non-Christian, or anti-Christian across its different schools in the modern era. It draws on a great many influences, most notably: Jewish Kabbalah, Western astrology, Alchemy, Pagan religions, especially Egyptian and Greco-Roman (it is from the latter that the term \"Hermetic\" is derived), neoplatonism, gnosticism, the Enochian system of angelic magic of John Dee and Edward Kelley, hermeticism, tantra and the symbolism of the tarot. Hermetic Qabalah differs from the Jewish form in being a more admittedly syncretic system, however it shares many concepts with Jewish Kabbalah.\n\nA primary concern of Hermetic Qabalah is the nature of divinity, its conception of which is quite markedly different from that presented in monotheistic religions; in particular there is not the strict separation between divinity and humankind which is seen in monotheisms. Hermetic Qabalah holds to the Neoplatonic conception that the manifest universe, of which material creation is a part, arose as a series of emanations from the godhead.\n\nThese emanations arise out of three preliminary states that are considered to precede manifestation. The first is a state of complete nullity, known as \"Ain\" (אין \"nothing\"); the second state, considered a \"concentration\" of \"Ain\", is \"Ain Suph\" (אין סוף \"without limit, infinite\"); the third state, caused by a \"movement\" of \"Ain Suph\", is \"Ain Suph Aur\" (אין סוף אור \"limitless light\"), and it is from this initial brilliance that the first emanation of creation originates.\n\nThe emanations of creation arising from \"Ain Suph Aur\" are ten in number, and are called \"Sephiroth\" (סְפִירוֹת, singular Sephirah סְפִירָה, \"enumeration\"). These are conceptualised somewhat differently in Hermetic Qabalah to the way they are in Jewish Kabbalah. \n\nFrom Ain Suph Aur crystallises Kether, the first sephirah of the Hermetic Qabalistic tree of life. From Kether emanate the rest of the sephirot in turn, viz. Kether (1), Chokhmah (2), Binah (3), Daath, Chesed (4), Geburah (5), Tiphareth (6), Netzach (7), Hod (8), Yesod (9), Malkuth (10). Daath is not assigned a number as it is considered part of Binah or a hidden sephirah.\n\nEach sephirah is considered to be an emanation of the divine energy (often described as 'the divine light') which ever flows from the unmanifest, through Kether into manifestation. This flow of light is indicated by the lightning flash shown on diagrams of the sephirotic tree which passes through each sephirah in turn according to their enumerations.\n\nEach sephirah is a nexus of divine energy, and each has a number of attributions. These attributions enable the Qabalist to form a comprehension of each particular sephirah's characteristics. This manner of applying many attributions to each sephirah is an exemplar of the diverse nature of Hermetic Qabalah. For example, the sephirah Hod has the attributions of: Glory, perfect intelligence, the eights of the tarot deck, the planet Mercury, the Egyptian god Thoth, the archangel Michael, the Roman god Mercury and the alchemical element Mercury. The general principle involved is that the Qabalist will meditate on all these attributions and by this means to acquire an understanding of the character of the sephirah including all its correspondences.\n\nHermetic Qabalists see the cards of the tarot as keys to the Tree of Life. The 22 cards including the twenty-one Trumps plus the Fool or Zero card are often called the \"Major Arcana\" or \"Greater Mysteries\" and are seen as corresponding to the twenty-two Hebrew letters and the twenty-two paths of the Tree; the ace to ten in each suit correspond to the ten Sephiroth in the four Qabalistic worlds; and the sixteen court cards relate to the classical elements in the four worlds. While the sephiroth describe the nature of divinity, the paths between them describe ways of knowing the Divine.\n\nAccording to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn's interpretation of the Kabbalah, there are ten archangels, each commanding one of the choirs of angels and corresponding to one of the Sephirot. It is similar to the Jewish angelic hierarchy.\n\nTraditionalist Judaic views of Kabbalah's origins view it as an original development from within the Jewish religion, perhaps expressed through syncretic terminology from Medieval Jewish Neoplatonism. Contemporary academics of Jewish mysticism have reassessed Gershom Scholem's theory that the new doctrine of Medieval Kabbalah assimilated an earlier Jewish version of Gnosticism; Moshe Idel instead has posited a historical continuity of development from early Jewish mysticism. In contrast, Hermeticists have taken different views of Qabalah's origins. Some authors see the origins of Qabalah not in Semitic/Jewish mysticism or ancient Egyptian Gnosticism, but in a western tradition originating in classical Greece with Indo-European cultural roots, later adopted by Jewish mystics.\n\nAccording to this view, \"Hermetic Qabalah\" would be the original Qabalah, even though the word itself is Judaic Hebrew, over the Christian Cabalah or the Jewish Kabbalah.\n\nJewish Kabbalah was absorbed into the Hermetic tradition at least as early as the 15th century when Giovanni Pico della Mirandola promoted a syncretic worldview combining Platonism, Neoplatonism, Aristotelianism, Hermeticism and Kabbalah. Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), a German magician, occult writer, theologian, astrologer, and alchemist, wrote the influential \"Three Books of Occult Philosophy\", incorporating Kabbalah in its theory and practice of Western magic. It contributed strongly to the Renaissance view of ritual magic's relationship with Christianity. Pico's Hermetic syncretism was further developed by Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit priest, hermeticist and polymath, who wrote extensively on the subject in 1652, bringing further elements such as Orphism and Egyptian mythology to the mix.\nOnce Hermeticism was no longer endorsed by the Christian Church it was driven underground and a number of Hermetic brotherhoods were formed. With the Enlightenment Age of Reason and its skepticism of mainstream religion, the tradition of exoteric-theological Christian Cabala declined, while esoteric-occult Hermetic Qabalah flourished in the Western mystery tradition. Non-Jewish Cabala, unlike in Judaic Kabbalah's mainstream censure of its magical side, became a central component of Western occult, magic and divination.\n\nRosicrucianism and esoteric branches of Freemasonry taught religious philosophies, Qabalah, and divine magic in progressive steps of initiation. Their esoteric teachings, and secret society structure of an outer body governed by a restricted inner level of adepts, laid the format for modern esoteric organisations.\n\nPost-Enlightenment Romanticism encouraged societal interest in occultism, of which Hermetic Qabalistic writing was a feature. Francis Barrett's The Magus (1801) handbook of ceremonial magic gained little notice until it influenced the French magical enthusiast Eliphas Levi (1810-1875). His fanciful literary embellishments of magical invocations presented Qabalism as synonymous with both so-called White and so-called Black magic. Levi's innovations included attributing the Hebrew letters to the Tarot cards, thus formulating a link between Western magic and Jewish esotericism which has remained fundamental ever since in Western magic. Levi had a deep impact on the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Through the occultists inspired by him (including Aleister Crowley, who considered himself Levi's reincarnation) Levi is remembered as one of the key founders of the 20th-century revival of magic.\n\nHermetic Qabalah was developed extensively by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Within the Golden Dawn, the fusing of Qabalistic principles such as the ten Sephiroth with Greek and Egyptian deities was made more cohesive and was extended to encompass other systems such as the Enochian system of angelic magic of John Dee and certain Eastern (particularly Hindu and Buddhist) concepts, all within the structure of a Masonic or Rosicrucian style esoteric order.\n\nAleister Crowley, who passed through the Golden Dawn before going on to form his own magical orders, is the most widely known exponent of Hermetic Magic or Magick as he preferred to spell it. Crowley's book \"Liber 777\" is a good illustration of the wider Hermetic approach. It is a set of tables of correspondences relating various parts of ceremonial magic and Eastern and Western religion to the thirty-two numbers representing the ten spheres (Sephiroth) plus the twenty-two paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The panentheistic nature of Hermetic Qabalists is plainly evident here, as one may simply check the table to see that Chesed (חסד \"Mercy\") corresponds to Jupiter, Isis, the colour blue (on the Queen Scale), Poseidon, Brahma, and amethyst.\n\nMany of the Golden Dawn's rituals were published by Crowley, altered in various ways to align them with his own New Aeon magickal approach. Israel Regardie eventually compiled the more traditional forms of these rituals and published them in book form.\n\nDion Fortune, an initiate of Alpha et Omega (an offshoot of the Golden Dawn), who went on to found the Fraternity of the Inner Light wrote the seminal book \"The Mystical Qabalah\", widely considered one of the best general introductions to modern Hermetic Qabalah.\n\nPaul Foster Case (1884–1954) was an American occultist and author of influential books on occult tarot and Qabalah. He founded the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A) mystery school, rooted in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Masonic blue lodge system, later extended by Ann Davies. B.O.T.A. teaches esoteric psychology, occult tarot, Hermetic Qabalah, astrology, and meditation.\n\nPat Zalewski is a student of Jack Taylor, who was, in turn, a student of Robert Felkin's Golden Dawn school, as taught in New Zealand after Felkin emigrated there. Zalewski has published numerous works on Hermetic Qabalah and the Golden Dawn tradition.\n\nSamael Aun Weor has written many significant works that discuss Kabbalah within many religions, such as the Egyptian, Pagan, and Central American religions, which is summarized in his work \"The Initiatic Path in the Arcana of Tarot and Kabbalah\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11051153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11051153", "title": "Sensu", "text": "Sensu\n\nSensu is a Latin word meaning \"in the sense of\". It is used in a number of fields including biology, geology, linguistics, semiotics, and law. Commonly it refers to how strictly or loosely an expression is used in describing any particular concept, but it also appears in expressions that indicate the convention or context of the usage.\n\n\"Sensu\" is the ablative case of the noun \"sensus\", here meaning \"sense\". It is often accompanied by an adjective (in the same case). Three such phrases are:\n\nSøren Kierkegaard uses the phrase \"sensu eminenti\" to mean \"in the pre-eminent [or most important or significant] sense\".\n\nWhen appropriate, comparative and superlative adjectives may also be used to convey the meaning of \"more\" or \"most\". Thus \"sensu stricto\" becomes \"sensu strictiore\" (\"in the stricter sense\" or \"more strictly speaking\") and \"sensu strictissimo\" (\"in the strictest sense\" or \"most strictly speaking\").\n\nCurrent definitions of the plant kingdom (Plantae) offer a biological example of when such phrases might be used. One definition of Plantae is that it consists of all green plants (comprising green algae and land plants), all red algae and all glaucophyte algae. A stricter definition excludes the red and glaucophyte algae; the group defined in this way could be called Plantae \"sensu stricto\". An even stricter definition excludes green algae, leaving only land plants; the group defined in this way could be called Plantae \"sensu strictissimo\". \n\nConversely, where convenient, some authors derive expressions such as \"\"sensu non strictissimo\"\", meaning \"not in the narrowest possible sense\".\n\nA similar form is in use to indicate the sense of a particular context, such as \"Nonmonophyletic groups are ... nonnatural (sensu cladistics) in that...\" or \"...computation of a cladogram (sensu phenetics)...\"\n\nAlso the expression \"sensu auctorum\" (abbreviation: \"sensu auct.\") is used to mean \"in the sense of certain authors\", who can be designated or described. It normally refers to a sense which is considered invalid and may be used in place of the author designation of a taxon in such a case (for instance, \"\"Tricholoma amethystinum\" sensu auct.\" is an erroneous name for a mushroom which should really be \"\"Lepista personata\" (Fr.) Cooke\").\n\nA related usage is in a concept-author citation (\"\"sec.\" Smith\", or \"\"sensu\" Smith\"), indicating that the intended meaning is the one defined by that author. (Here \"\"sec\".\" is an abbreviation of \"\"secundum\"\", meaning \"following\" or \"in accordance with\".) Such an author citation is different from the citation of the nomenclatural \"author citation\" or \"authority citation\". In biological taxonomy the author citation following the name of a taxon simply identifies the author who originally published the name and applied it to the type, the specimen or specimens that one refers to in case of doubt about the definition of a species. Given that an author (such as Linnaeus, for example) was the first to supply a definite type specimen and to describe it, it is to be hoped that his description would stand the tests of time and criticism, but even if it does not, then as far as practical the name that he had assigned will apply. It still will apply in preference to any subsequent names or descriptions that anyone proposes, whether his description was correct or not, and whether he had correctly identified its biological affinities or not. This does not always happen of course; all sorts of errors occur in practice. For example, a collector might scoop a netful of small fish and describe them as a new species; it then might turn out that he had failed to notice that there were several (possibly unrelated) species in the net. It then is not clear what he had named, so his name can hardly be taken seriously, either \"s.s. or s.l\".\n\nAfter a species has been established in this manner, specialist taxonomists may work on the subject and make certain types of changes in the light of new information. In modern practice it is greatly preferred that the collector of the specimens immediately passes them to specialists for naming; it is rarely possible for non-specialists to tell whether their specimens are of new species or not, and in modern times not many publications or their referees would accept an amateur description.\n\nIn any event, the person who finally classifies and describes a species has the task of taxonomic circumscription. Circumscription means in essence that anyone competent in the matter can tell \"which creatures are included in the species described, and which are excluded\". It is in this process of species description that the question of the sense arises, because that is where the worker produces and argues his view of the proper circumscription. Equally, or perhaps even more strongly, the arguments for deciding questions concerning higher taxa such as families or orders, require very difficult circumscription, where changing the \"sense\" applied could totally upset an entire scheme of classification, either constructively or disastrously.\n\nNote that the principles of circumscription apply in various ways in non-biological senses. In biological taxonomy the usual assumption is that circumscription reflects the shared ancestry perceived as most likely in the light of the currently available information; in geology or legal contexts far wider and more arbitrary ranges of logical circumscription commonly apply, not necessarily formally uniformly. However, the usage of expressions incorporating \"sensu\" remains functionally similarly intelligible among the fields. In geology for example, in which the concept of ancestry is looser and less pervasive than in biology, one finds usages such as:\n\nReaders unfamiliar with technical aspects of taxonomy might find it helpful first to think of everyday examples of the principles. When dealing with groups and parts of groups (subgroups) of different types of things, taxonomists sometimes wish to speak of the full set under consideration, and sometimes just a subset, but almost always want to refer to some particular part, to the exclusion of other elements; in issuing an instruction to poll the opinions of twenty-one members of a village community, a competent pollster would not accept the reactions of two heads of households, three infants, four dogs, five cats, six rats, and a tramcar. That would be taking \"sensu lato\" beyond good sense.\n\nInstead the instruction should specify which \"sense\" should apply, such as \"sensu stricto\" (or \"strictiore\"):\n\nor \"sensu lato\" (or \"latiore\"): \n\nThe important thing is that in each example the instruction circumscribed the appropriate subjects; that means that the interviewer could tell \"which people were wanted\" and correspondingly, \"which were to be left out\".\nThe circumscription could be in terms of very specific criteria:\n\nor the criterion could be very casual, even vague: \n\nHowever simple that may sound, it is fundamental both in formal science and in everyday affairs. Circumscription amounts to the basis for telling things apart, which in turn is the rational basis for all diagnoses, formal or informal.\n\nIn biological taxonomy, as the next section describes, the same principles apply, but they deal in various ways with circumscribing living things according to any relevant criterion. In modern biology the criterion usually has something to do with which creature descended from which kind of ancestor, in which ways it changed in the process, and by how much. However, in more general taxonomies, although the principles of circumscription are fundamentally similar, the criteria could be largely different in type as well as in detail.\n\nIn short, in every discipline the sense of circumscription in taxonomy must reflect the nature of the subject matter.\n\nSensu is used in the taxonomy of living creatures to specify which circumscription of a given taxon is meant, where more than one circumscription can be defined.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Red and white colours linking its etymology straight to Poland - red and white being Poland' s national colours and of course the name \"polka\" meaning the Polish woman, Polish lady and Polish girl. \n\n\"Gris\" means \"pig\", and was at that time used as an expression for candy.\n\nPolkagris is a special candy stick type which was invented in Gränna 1859 by Amalia Eriksson (1824–1923), a poor 35-year-old widow. Amalia needed to support herself and her family, when her husband died. Amalia Eriksson got the town council's permission to open a bakery to make pastries and peppermint rocks, and opened a shop in Gränna. She kept the recipe secret and it was only revealed upon her death.\n\nThe candy is made of sugar dough which is boiled, kneaded on a marble baking table, pulled, and twisted by hand to the right size. The candies contain peppermint, sugar, water, and a very small amount of vinegar, and are sold in about 20 stores in the town.\n\nThe candies come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, but the red and white peppermint flavored sticks are the classic original polkagris. The recipe has been included in Swedish cookbooks.\n\nThe town of Gränna has only 2,500 residents, but its convenient location off one of the most traveled highways in Sweden attracts over a million visitors per year, many of them drawn by the famous candy, which has been a tradition for more than 150 years.\n\nThe first store making polkagrisar outside of Gränna opened in the summer of 2011, on Lilla Nygatan 10 in the Old town of Stockholm.\n\nIn 2016, polkagris made its debut in the US in the small town of Solvang, California. It is made by hand in small batches at the Swedish Candy Factory.\n\nIn recent years, Gränna has arranged an annual world championship in polkagris making as a tourist event. The candy is handmade, and the perfect polkagris should weigh exactly 50 grams. The championship is held every year on 25 July, outdoors, at the Lake Vättern's shore.\n\nA number of polkagris-related records have been registered for the Guinness Book of World Records. The world's longest polkagris (1989) was long; the highest polkagris (1993) was ; the world's heaviest polkagris stick (2003) was .\n\n"}

The soldiers, but also the various merchants, diplomats and employees of the Habsburg Empire in Veneto became quickly accustomed to drinking local wine in the taverns, but they were not familiar with the wide variety of wines from the Veneto, and the alcohol content was higher than they were accustomed to. The newcomers started to ask the local hosts to spray a bit of water into the wine (, in German) to make the wines lighter; the real original spritz was composed of sparkling white wine or red wine diluted with fresh water. \n\nThe first evolution of Spritz arrived in the early 1900s, when siphons for carbonated water became widely available and made it possible to make a sparkling Spritz using still wine. This development introduced the Spritz to new types of customers, such as Austrian noblewomen, who, with the drink's touch of glamour, could now afford to be seen drinking a soft drink.\nOver the years the drink has \"grown up\" with the infinite variety of possible additions such as a sort of liquor (Aperol, Campari, Select, Jardesca California Aperitiva) or a bitter as the China Martini or Cynar with a lemon peel inside.\n\nThe drink is prepared with prosecco wine, a dash of some bitter liqueur such as Aperol, Campari, Cynar, or, especially in Venice, \"Select\". The glass is then topped off with sparkling mineral water. It is usually served over ice in a lowball glass (or sometimes a martini glass or wine glass) and garnished with a slice of orange, or sometimes an olive, depending on the liqueur. \n\nThere is no single composition for a spritz, and it is prepared with different ingredients in different towns and cities, meaning that the alcohol content is highly variable. However, a common denominator is the presence of Prosecco and sparkling water, which by quantity must be at least 40% and 30% respectively, with the remaining 30% being made up from a great variety of alcoholic drinks, sometimes mixed, but with an unwritten rule to preserve the red color of the cocktail. Finally a slice of lemon, orange or an olive and a few ice cubes are added.\n\n"}

{"id": "11115726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11115726", "title": "Cornish mythology", "text": "Cornish mythology\n\nCornish mythology is the folk tradition and mythology of the Cornish people. It consists partly of folk traditions developed in Cornwall, England, and partly of traditions developed by Britons elsewhere before the end of the first millennium, often shared with those of the Breton and Welsh peoples. Some of this contains remnants of the mythology of pre-Christian Britain.\n\nThere is much traditional folklore in Cornwall, often tales of giants, mermaids, Bucca, piskies or the 'pobel vean' (little people.) These are still popular today, with many events hosting a 'droll teller' to tell the stories: such myths and stories have found much publishing success, particularly in children's books. The fairy tale Jack the Giant Killer takes place in Cornwall. Many early British legends associate King Arthur with Cornwall, putting his birthplace at Tintagel, the court of King Mark of Cornwall, uncle of Tristan and husband of Iseult, the most famous Cornish lovers.\n\nCornwall shares its ancient cultural heritage with its 'Brythonic cousins' Brittany and Wales, as well as Ireland and parts of England such as neighbouring Devon. Many ancient tales of the Bards, whether the Arthurian Cycle, Tristan and Iseult or the Mabinogion take place in the ancient kingdom of Cerniw between Greater and Lesser Britains with a foot on either side of the 'British Sea' \"Mor Brettanek/Mor Breizh\".\n\nPart of Cornish mythology is derived from tales of seafaring pirates and smugglers who thrived in and around Cornwall from the early modern period through to the 19th century. Cornish pirates exploited both their knowledge of the Cornish coast as well as its sheltered creeks and hidden anchorages. For many fishing villages, loot and contraband provided by pirates supported a strong and secretive underground economy in Cornwall.\n\nLegendary creatures that appear in Cornish folklore include buccas, knockers, Giants and piskies. Tales of these creatures are thought to have developed as supernatural explanations for the frequent and deadly cave-ins that occurred during 18th century Cornish tin mining, or else a creation of the oxygen-starved minds of exhausted miners who returned from the underground.\n\nThe knocker or bucca (Cornish) is the Welsh and Cornish equivalent of Irish leprechauns and English and Scottish brownies. About two feet tall and grizzled, but not misshapen, they live beneath the ground. Here they wear tiny versions of standard miner's garb and commit random mischief, such as stealing a miner's unattended tools and food - they were often cast a small offering of food – usually the crust of a pasty – to appease their malevolence.\n\nMany landscape features, from the barren granite rock features on Bodmin Moor, to the dramatic cliff seascape, to the mystical form of St Michael's Mount are explained as the work of Giants and English tales such as the early eighteenth century Jack the Giant Killer may recall much older British folk traditions recorded elsewhere in medieval Welsh language manuscripts and closely related to the folk traditions of Dartmoor in neighbouring Devon.\n\nOld Michaelmas Day falls on 11 October (10 October according to some sources). According to an old legend, blackberries should not be picked after this date. This is because, so British folklore goes, Satan was banished from Heaven on this day, fell into a blackberry bush and cursed the brambles as he fell into them. In Cornwall, a similar legend prevails, according to which the devil urinated on them.\n\n\n\"Mist from the hill / Brings water for the mill; / Mist from the sea /Brings fine weather for me.\" \"Lundy plain, Sign of rain\" (current in north Cornwall where Lundy Island is normally visible). \n\nNellie Sloggett of Padstow devoted much of her attention to Cornish folklore and legend. She collected and recorded many stories about the Piskey folk, fairies of Cornish myth and legend. She published most of her works in this category under her better-known pen-name of Enys Tregarthen.\n\n\nDozmary Pool is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to Arthurian legend, Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur to The Lady of the Lake. Another legend relating to the pool concerns Jan Tregeagle.\n\nThe Beast of Bodmin has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.\n\nAccording to legend, the Mermaid of Padstow created the Doom Bar as a dying curse, after being shot by a sailor. However, there are many different versions of the story and the precise details are unclear. Some versions start by stating that she used to guide ships up the estuary and others that she would visit and spy upon ships in harbour, yet more tell of how she used to sit upon a rock at Hawkers Cove. She then met a man, and one fell in love with the other. One version explains that she was love sick, and tried to lure him beneath the waves, however he escaped by shooting her. Another version suggested the man, Tristram Bird, fell in love with her and asked her to marry him, though she refused. In his rage he shot her. Another suggestion is that a fisherman, Tom Yeo, shot her because he thought she was a seal. The ending of the legend is generally similar. With her dying breath, she levelled a curse at Padstow, or at the harbour itself, stating that the harbour will be desolate or unsafe. With that, a great storm came, wrecking many boats and creating the great sand bank known as the Doom Bar.\n\nWithin the bounds of Gulval parish lies the disused Ding Dong mine, reputedly one of the oldest in Cornwall. Popular local legend claims that Joseph of Arimathea, a tin trader, visited the mine and brought a young Jesus to address the miners, although there is no evidence to support this.\n\nAt Zennor there is a legend of the Mermaid of Zennor and at Mousehole, Tom Bawcock is a legendary fisherman from the village who according to legend risked his life to go out and fish and managed to come back with enough fish to feed the village until the storm was over. All the fish was put into a big pie, and the pie called \"Stargazy pie\".\n\nThe Merry Maidens stone circle at St Buryan: the local myth about the creation of the stones suggests that nineteen maidens were turned into stone as punishment for dancing on a Sunday. (\"Dans Maen\" translates as Stone Dance.) The pipers, two megaliths some distance north-east of the circle, are said to be the petrified remains of the musicians who played for the dancers. A more detailed story explains why the Pipers are so far from the Maidens - apparently the two pipers heard the church clock in St Buryan strike midnight, realised they were breaking the sabbath, and started to run up the hill away from the maidens who carried on dancing without accompaniment. These petrifaction legends are often associated with stone circles, and is reflected in the folk names of some of the nearby sites, for example, the Tregeseal Dancing Stones, the Nine Maidens of Boskednan, as well as the more distant Hurlers and Pipers on Bodmin Moor.\n\n\n"}

The beef and pork industry meant a plentiful supply of offal. Offcuts were available at affordable prices for local consumption by the poor and underprivileged. An entire Cork cuisine developed based on offal – particularly pig offal. Examples include crubeens/cruibín (pigs' trotters); pigs' tails; drisheen – a boiled blood sausage traditionally served with tripe; bodice – plain or salted pig ribs, cooked as a simple white stew, or as a salted bacon dish cooked with cabbage and turnip. In Cork, the word offal came to mean one specific dish – pig's backbone. Now illegal to use because of BSE, it was cooked either salted or as a white stew.\n\nThe meat ingredients for Skirts and Kidneys can be bought generally in any pork butcher's shop. Skirts are the trimmings from the around the diaphragm. While the meat is thin, it is quite tender. It is encased in a tough white membrane which needs to be stripped off before cooking. Kidneys need to be carefully washed in copious amounts of fresh water to ensure that all traces of urine are washed away.\n\nThe dish is a basic white stew made with a few simple ingredients: skirts, kidneys, onions, thyme, salt, white pepper, water, and potatoes. All the ingredients are placed in a large saucepan of boiling water and slowly simmered for about two hours. At the end of cooking, if necessary, a little cornflour (cornstarch) mixed as a slurry with a little water can be stirred in as thickening.\n\nA Waterford variant involves dicing the onion quite small and excluding the thyme and salt, instead opting for generous amounts of white pepper.\n\nThe meal is often served with crusty white bread to soak up the juices.\n\n"}

It originates from Kendal in Cumbria, England. Kendal Mint Cake is popular among climbers and mountaineers, especially those from the United Kingdom, as a source of energy.\n\nKendal Mint Cake is based on a traditional recipe known as \"mint cake\", \"peppermint tablet,\" and various other names. There are currently two companies that still produce Kendal Mint Cake. The origin of the cake is allegedly the result of a batch of glacier mint sweets that went wrong. In 1869 Joseph Wiper, who married into the Thompson family of confectioners based in Kendal, supposedly left the boiled solution for glacier mints overnight and it turned cloudy and solidified. The 'mint cake' was then discovered in the morning. Wiper began producing mint cake, with several other confectioneries following suit. After Joseph Wiper emigrated to Canada in 1912 his great-nephew, Robert Wiper, took over the family business. Robert Wiper marketed Kendal mint cake as an energy snack used on famous expeditions, including the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, which largely led to its rise in international popularity amongst mountaineers and hikers.\n\nRomney's was founded in 1918, and used an old recipe to create mint cake. This mint cake was sold in Kendal and sent by train to other areas of the north-west for sale. In 1987, Romney's bought Wiper's Mint Cake from Harry Wiper, who had inherited ownership of Wiper's in 1960 when his father Robert Wiper died. \nIn 2016 Romney's collaborated with fashion site Lyst to create a limited run of \"Kendall Mint Cakes\" to celebrate Kendall Jenner's 21st Birthday on 3 November. 200 limited edition cakes were given away on social media.\n\nQuiggin's Mint Cake is the oldest surviving mint cake company. The Quiggin family has been making confectionery since 1840 in the Isle of Man. When one of the four sons, Daniel Quiggin, moved to Kendal in 1880, the mint cake company was formed.\n\nIn the BBC TV programme \"Great British Menu\", series 5, Lisa Allen visited Quiggin's factory and used Quiggin's Kendal Mint Cake in her Strawberries with Meringue & Kendal Mint Cake Water Ice dessert.\n\nIn the BBC TV programme \"Great British Railway Journeys\" (Series 7, Episode 2), Michael Portillo visited Quiggin's factory.\n\nWilson's Mint Cake was founded in 1913, when James Wilson purchased a factory in the Stricklandgate area of the town. He had previously made and distributed types of toffee, but he decided to instead concentrate on mint cake. In 1966, the firm moved to a location in the Cross Lane area of Kendal. Wilson's was licensed to sell a Beatrix Potter range of sweets.\nAs of 2007, the factory was run by the grandson of James, Andrew Wilson, and mint cake was no longer the major product of the company as chocolate confectionery took up 90% of orders. After moving from Kendal to Holme in 2013, it was reported in 2016 that the company had closed down.\n\nKendal Mint Cake is made from sugar, glucose, water and peppermint oil. Although the exact recipe and way of manufacturing mint cake is kept secret, it is known that it is created in the following way:\n\nThere are numerous types of mint cake that are now available. Mint cake made with white sugar, mint cake made with brown sugar, and mint cake enrobed in chocolate are the three most popular varieties.\n\nKendal Mint Cake has been used on many expeditions around the world as a source of energy;\n\n\n"}

Other herbs such as parsley and thyme are often used, although these are not considered authentic Lincolnshire sausages. Lincolnshire sausages are also characterised by their open, chunky texture, the result of the constituent pork being coarsely ground rather than minced.\n\nLincolnshire sausages are made with coarsely chopped or ground pork mixed with binders, seasonings and preservative. Traditionally, the dominant seasoning flavour has always been that of the herb sage, but some recipes include other herbs, such as parsley or thyme, and flavourings such as onion. Efforts to standardise and control the manufacture of Lincolnshire sausages have resulted in a proposed ingredients list to which future manufacturers of Lincolnshire sausages may have to adhere:\n\n\nUnlike the Cumberland sausage, there is no standard width or length for a Lincolnshire sausage. Commonly, the variety is associated with a broader style, but Lincolnshire chipolata sausages are also widely available.\n\nSome manufacturers produce meat-free sausages that use sage as the dominant flavouring and these are commonly sold as vegetarian Lincolnshire sausages.\n\nIn 2004, a group of 13 Lincolnshire butchers, led by the large sausage-producing firm of George Adams & Sons, began moves to protect the name of the Lincolnshire sausage, applying for Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status under European Union law. In support of the PGI application, the Lincolnshire Sausage Association was formed in early 2006. Under these proposals, to qualify as a 'Lincolnshire' sausage, not only would a sausage have to be manufactured in the county, but it would also have to conform to the standard ingredient list, above.\n\nIn 2010, a group of Lincolnshire butchers introduced a voluntary 5 pence 'tax' in support of the PGI application, and to fund the fight against Lincolnshire sausages being manufactured elsewhere or making too much use of seasonings other than sage.\n\nEvery year, a competition is held in Lincoln to find the best Lincolnshire sausage.\n\n\n"}

The McKinney family began to make their own sweets and on 15 August 1927. The first sweets were made on the open coke fire in a shed at the back of the shop. The land on which the factory stood was purchased in November 1929, the first sod was cut in February 1930. Six people were employed at the time.\n\nThe company at the time was known as Mayfield Confectionery but the name was quickly changed as another company in Manchester traded by this name. The company name was changed to Oatfield. The land on which the factory was built was known as \"Oatfield\". The \"May\" was dropped and \"Oat\" was substituted and hence the name “Oatfield”. The weekly production of confectionery was about 3 tons. Today the company produces approximately 65 tons a week.\n\nSugar was purchased in the 1930s from Tate & Lyle. Glucose came from Manchester. They were delivered by ship and rail via Derry to Letterkenny railway station. Later, glucose was shipped from the Netherlands to the Letterkenny Port. In later years, only Irish sugar and Irish glucose were used. Butter had always been Irish Creamery Butter.\n\nBy 1960 Oatfield decided to stop marketing packed sweets made by Cadburys, Rowntree, Urney's Chocolates, Bassetts Licorice Allsorts, Jacobs Biscuits, William and Wood, Ritchies Mints and Milroy Confectionery. The company now began to focus entirely on selling Oatfield sweets. This was a major decision and proved a major success for the company.\n\nExporting began in August 1964.

Tougher cuts such as chuck steak, boneless chuck steak, short ribs and 7-bone roast are popular cuts for this technique. While the toughness of the fibers makes them unsuitable for oven roasting, slow cooking tenderizes the meat as the liquid exchanges some of its flavor with the beef. The result is tender, succulent meat and a rich liquid that lends itself to gravy.\n\nIn North America, where it is also known as \"Yankee pot roast\", the dish is often served with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes and onions simmered in the cooking liquid. Pot roast is an American variation of the French dish boeuf à la mode that has been modified by influences from German Americans and American Jews.\n\nAccording to food writer James Beard, French immigrants to New England brought their cooking method called \"à l'étouffée\" for tenderizing meats.

Today, Georgia is still home to the grey wolf, which for hundreds of years has been a part of Georgian culture and folklore.\n\nThe original Georgian version of the Russian name Eristoff or Eristov was Eristavi (ერისთავი). The title means ‘head of the nation’ but translates more accurately as ‘head of a military force’. By the 19th century, five noble families each representing a different part of Georgia were using the name Eristhavi. Prince Ivane Eristoff who first created Eristoff vodka in 1806 was from the northwest province of Racha.\n\nA landmark in the history of the Eristoff family and Eristoff vodka came in the late 19th century when Ivane’s great grandson, Prince Alexander Constantine Eristoff moved from Georgia to Saint Petersburg. Prince Alexander went on to enjoy a distinguished military career eventually reaching the rank of Colonel in the Imperial Guard.\n\nAfter the Soviet takeover the Eristovs were forced to leave Georgia, as they were likely to be sent to Siberia.

An unusual and characteristic feature of the szopka is the use of historical buildings of Kraków as backdrop for the Nativity of Jesus. In 2018, it was inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nNativity scenes, common in Christian cultures, originated with Saint Francis of Assisi in the 13th century and quickly spread to Poland. During the Middle Ages a specific type of nativity-based play, referred to as \"Jasełka\", developed in Poland.\n\nSome performers displayed their szopkas together with puppets in a form of a street theatre. In some, movable puppets were replaced with immobile wooden figurines. At times subject-specific puppets or figurines were and are being added to illustrate elements of Polish culture, ranging from historical figures like winged hussars and Tadeusz Kościuszko, through the legendary sorcerer Pan Twardowski and Dragon of Wawel, to contemporary politicians or artists. In the 18th century the spread of such non-religious content led to a ban on more extravagant nativity scenes in some Polish churches; following the ban, the performances evolved into a true expression of folk art.\n\nThe szopka tradition dates back to the 19th century, when Kraków's craftsmen – masons, woodworkers – begun to make them as a seasonal decoration in order to earn extra income during Christmas. The custom grew in popularity, with people willing to pay to watch szopka collections – often carried by door-to-door carollers – or to own them. Among the notable early patrons of the custom was the magnate family of Potoccy.\n\nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, szopkas started to be made and sold as souvenirs of Kraków. The city's municipal authorities decided to support this tradition by announcing the first competition in December 1937. Since then, except for the duration of the Second World War, the szopka presentation and tournament takes place every year on the first Thursday of each December, at the Main Market Square, Kraków, next to the Adam Mickiewicz Monument. The best szopkas are then displayed in the Historical Museum of Kraków in Krzysztofory Palace.\n\nThe ornate structures can be up to two metres high and three metres wide. The edifice most often used as an inspiration for szopka models is the St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków with its easily recognisable spires. Other popular choices include Wawel Castle, Sukiennice trade hall and the Barbican of Kraków.\n\nThe Bethlehem is often shown on the second floor, as the first one is used for a display of historical figurines.\n\n"}

It is one of the standard dishes found in the dim sum cuisine of Hong Kong and China as well as overseas Chinatown restaurants.

Some are homemade, and some are mass-produced on an industrial scale and treated in various ways to preserve them. A wide variety of types, styles and flavors of instant soups exist. Commercial instant soups are usually dried or dehydrated, canned, or treated by freezing.\n\nCommercial instant soups are manufactured in several types. Some consist of a packet of dry soup stock. These do not contain water, and are prepared by adding water and then heating the product for a short time, or by adding hot water directly to the dry soup mix. Instant soup can also be produced in a dry powder form, such as Unilever's Cup-a-Soup\n\nCanned (tinned) instant soups contain liquid soup that is prepared by heating their contents. Some canned soups are condensed, and require additional water to bring them to their intended strength, while others are canned in a ready-to-eat, single-strength form. Dr. John T. Dorrance, an employee with the Campbell Soup Company, invented condensed soup in 1897. Consumers sometimes use condensed soups (without diluting them), as a sauce base. Some instant liquid soups are manufactured in microwaveable containers. Additionally, some instant soups, such as Knorr's Erbswurst, are prepared in a concentrated paste form. Knorr ceased production of Erbswurst on December 31, 2018.\n\nInstant noodle soups such as Cup Noodles contain dried instant ramen noodles, dehydrated vegetable and meat products, and seasonings, and are prepared by adding hot water. Packaged instant ramen noodle soup is typically formed as a cake, and often includes a seasoning packet that is added to the noodles and water during preparation. Some also include separate packets of oil and garnishes used to season the product. Momofuku Ando, the founder of Nissin Foods, developed packaged ramen noodle soup in 1958.\n\nA multitude of instant soup varieties exist. For example, there are several Lipton and Knorr-brand dry instant soups, such as onion, vegetable, tomato beef and cream of spinach. Instant miso soup is generally manufactured in two forms, one as miso paste with preserved vegetable condiments, generally of the shiro (white) kind, and the other as granulated miso. One of the primary uses of dehydrated miso is for the production of instant miso soup. Chicken, beef and seafood/shrimp are the most popular flavors by consumers of ramen noodle instant soups.\n\nCommercially-prepared instant soups are usually dried or dehydrated, canned, or treated by freezing. Some dry instant soups are prepared with thickening ingredients, such as pregelatinized starch, that function at a lower temperature compared to others. Additional ingredients used in commercial instant soups to contribute to their consistency include maltodextrins, emulsified fat powders, sugars, potato starch, xanthan gum and guar gum. Sometimes ingredients used in dry instant soups are ground into fragments, which enables them to be dissolved when water is added. These particulates are sometimes prepared using freeze drying and puff drying.\n\nFreeze drying is a recent dehydration breakthrough-method that is restricted to high-value foods due to the high cost associated with the process. Despite its cost, freeze-drying is very effective in retaining the overall quality and nutritional value of the food through a process called sublimation, where water is removed (evaporated) from food in its frozen state without the transition through the liquid state. Removing water from food prevents spoilage as it does not give an environment that favors the growth of spoilage-causing microorganisms such as bacteria, mould, and yeast. Freeze-drying also reduces the total weight of the food, especially fruit and vegetables that are mostly water, thus making the transportation of these products more efficient. Vegetables used in instant soup mixes often undergo freeze-drying that helps them retain their nutritional value, texture, and flavor. Furthermore, as the food remains rigid during dehydration, subliming water creates holes where the evaporated ice crystals used to be. This allows freeze-dried foods such as vegetables to retain their shape without shrinkage, and these foods rehydrate completely when water is added to the mix that fills the voids left by the subliming water. Due to the reduced water content of the freeze-dried foods that inhibit the growth of microorganisms and prevents enzymatic chemical reactions, these foods are considered shelf-stable and can be kept safe from spoilage for years by preventing the reabsorption of moisture. Freeze-dried foods can be stored in room temperature without the need for refrigeration.\n\nAlthough uncommon compared to most applications, sometimes a seasoning solution is sprayed directly onto ramen noodles to enhance their flavor, prior to being packaged. Flavor ingredients used in instant ramen noodle soup include dried vegetables and meats, salt, MSG, onion, garlic, yeast extract, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, essential oil extracts and natural or synthetic flavor compounds. Essential oils derived from onion, garlic and clove are sometimes used as flavorants for instant ramen soup, and may be manufactured using expeller pressing or solvent extraction and distillation. Sophisticated methods exist that create flavor compounds, or \"complex flavors\", for the flavoring of instant ramen noodle soups, in which volatile compounds from substances are isolated and reconstituted to create seasoning blends. Techniques to create flavor compounds for instant ramen soups include gas chromatography utilized with mass spectrometry and olfactometry. Ramen noodle soup seasoning packets may also contain anticaking agents and flow agents to prevent the product from clumping into a solid mass.\n"}

{"id": "11378291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11378291", "title": "Chatang", "text": "Chatang\n\nChatang (茶汤; pinyin: chátāng; literally \"tea soup\") or seasoned flour mush is a traditional gruel common to both Beijing cuisine and Tianjin cuisine, and often sold as a snack on the street. It is made from sorghum flour and/or broomcorn millet and/or proso millet flour and glutinous millet flour. The Chinese name is figurative, not literal, as there is neither any tea nor any soup in this dish.\n\nThe dish is prepared in two steps. First, flours of sorghum and/or millet are cooked in advance, often by stir-frying. When a customer orders the dish, hot water is poured into a bowl containing the flour(s) to create a paste-like mush, which is served with white and/or brown sugar and sweet osmanthus sauce (桂花酱; pinyin: guìhuā jiàng). The sweet osmanthus plant is not native to northern China.\n\nTraditionally, the skill of the server was judged on several factors and one of them is regarding the resulting mush: the most skillful server would be able to create the mush so thick that when a chopstick is inserted into the mush it remains vertical, while at the same time the mush remains fluid. Other criteria for the servers' skills included the ability not to splash any hot water outside the bowl and spill out any flour, because traditionally all ingredients are placed in a bowl into which is poured boiling water from a special copper kettle with a long, dragon-shaped spout called 龙嘴大铜壶 (pinyin: lóngzuǐ dàtónghú; literally \"dragon mouth large copper jug\"), and special skills were needed to handle this equipment. The ingredients are then stirred together and the \"chatang\" is eaten with a spoon.\n\nTraditionally, \"chatang\" vendors were easily distinguished by the kettle they used. The kettle was extremely large, up to four feet tall with a diameter in excess of a foot, and was often made of copper. There are two kinds of kettles: those used by street vendors, and those found in restaurants and tea houses. The two differ in internal structure.\n\nThe kettles used by street vendors are double-layered, with fuel in the inner layer in the center and water in the outside layer, similar to samovars. The advantage of such a structure is that it reduces the need to carry a stove to heat the water in the kettle, and it improves fuel efficiency since most heat is utilized, in contrast to the use of a separate kettle and stove. Furthermore, in the windy weather conditions of northern China, such a structure prevents the flame from being blown out by the wind.\n\nDespite the two varieties of kettles' identical external appearance, the complex structure of the kettles used by street vendors is not present for those used in restaurants and tea houses, for obvious reasons: since the stove is located inside, it is immune to the windy weather outside and stoves are necessary to cook other dishes, so there is no need to pay extra for a more expensive kettle with such a complex structure.\n\nThe different ways of serving seasoned flour mush have some cultural significance in distinguishing that of Beijing cuisine from Tianjin cuisine, since the same kind of seasoned flour mush tastes identical. Traditionally, the styles of serving were clearly different when the hot water is poured from the kettle:\n\nThe way hot water was poured in Beijing cuisine was that the server stood straight up, with legs apart at distance greater than the width of his shoulder, while the upper body leaned toward the bowl. In contrast, the way hot water was poured in Tianjin cuisine was that the server was in a semi-squatting down position with body straight. Obviously, such a feat is rather dangerous, especially without any specialized training, and thus the special kettle has been phased out as modern technology enables the dish to be served like coffee, and the use of a kettle only survives in extremely rare occasions as a cultural heritage demonstration.\n\nSeasoned millet mush (in Chinese, simplified: 面茶, traditional: 麵茶, pinyin: \"miànchá\", literally \"flour tea\") is a savoury flour gruel. It is made using only millet flour rather than a combination of sorghum and millet flour. Rather than sweet osmanthus sauce and sugar, it is seasoned with sesame paste, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and salt.\n\nSeasoned oily flour mush (in Chinese, 油茶, pinyin: \"yóuchá\", literally, \"oil tea\") is a variety of seasoned flour mush made by stir-frying, or sometimes pan-frying, the flour with animal fat, typically beef fat. Beef bone marrow may also be added. After frying, it is served in the same manner as seasoned flour mush.\n\n\n"}

Intellectual disabilities can also be a factor, but this is not always the case. The wheelchairs can be either motorised, or manually pushed.\n\nIn case of all electric and some manual wheelchairs, the player propels themselves where possible. If this is not physically possible, the player is allowed to use a 'pusher' to move them around the court. However, the pusher is passive in the sense that they cannot become physically involved in the game. Wheelchair soccer is very similar to the able-bodied form of the game in terms of rules and structure—the only real difference being that the player uses their wheelchair to move around the court and also to propel the ball when passing, to tackle another player (in defense), and to score goals. If a player is physically able to kick the ball, then they are allowed to do so. Also, if the goalkeeper is able to stop the ball with their hands, they are allowed to do so.\n\nIn most cases, there is both a seniors and reserves division. In reserves, there are no goalkeepers. This format caters for the players who are more severely physically disabled than others. The reserves division can also be for players who are beginners. Many players later make the transition to the seniors division.\n\nDifficulties can arise in the playing of the game due to the vast differences in the physical abilities of the players. The only thing that is common to all players is that they have a physical disability and are wheelchair users. This means that players who kick the ball are usually more powerful and accurate than those who cannot. In response, some players who use electric wheelchairs attach a flat metal or wooden panel to the front of their foot plates. This measure both prevents the ball on sliding underneath the chair during play (a common problem), and also gives the player a flat surface when making contact with the ball. This increases passing and potential goalscoring accuracy.\n\nIn the senior division, rules also state that the attacking player is not allowed go into the semicircular area inhabited by the goalkeeper; and all the shots on goal must be taken from outside the semicircle. This is 'the last line of defence'.\n\nThe games are played indoors (usually on a modified basketball court). The ball is also slightly larger than a regulation-sized soccer ball.\n\nWheelchair soccer is in Victoria, Australia, where it is developed as a partnership between Scope (Vic Ltd) and the Football Federation Victoria. Wheelchair soccer is split up into two regions, Southeast and Northwest, both with reserves and senior divisions.

It goes back to a historic person called Mahima Svami (or Mahima Gosain).\n\nHe is said to have appeared in Puri in 1826. Dissatisfied with the ritualised idol worship of Lord Jagannath, he left Puri and travelled to the Kapilas hills near Dhenkanal, where he engaged himself in severe Yogic practices. In 1862, he became a \"siddha\" and started preaching a new \"dharma\". He is said to have attained \"samadhi\" in 1876. Under his first disciple, Govinda Baba, and the dissident saint poet Bhima Bhoi, the movement shifted away from the coastal region towards the central and western parts of Odisha. Spreading also to other states (Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam), people from different regions and sociocultural backgrounds joined as followers. Since then, several monastic as well as lay currents and competing associations emerged and various regional centres (Joranda, Khaliapali) have been established. Mahima Dharma is a popular ascetic movement which considers the void, \"shunya\", as the divine principle, opposing as such any idol worship. The void can only be venerated through fire, or its manifestation in the Sun, traits which link Mahima Dharma to the \"nirguna bhakti\" tradition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11462433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11462433", "title": "Hōtō", "text": "Hōtō\n\nWheat farming and the flour culture were brought into Yamanashi prefecture due to shortages in local rice crops. Sericulture had turned lands traditionally reserved for rice crops into silk farms, and flour products like hōtō were invented as a means to counter food shortages which arose from this change in agriculture.\n\nThis transition may have begun in Yamanashi's Gunnai region, where rice farming was impossible to start due to cold temperature and large amounts of volcanic debris embedded into the soil. Wheat farming spread through the rest of the prefecture and into the neighboring Nagano, Shizuoka, Saitama, and Gunma prefectures, where similar cuisine using flour dough and soup can also be found. For example, a dish called \"nibōtō\", which is identical to \"hōtō\" except with a soy sauce-flavored soup, can be found throughout Saitama and Gunma prefectures.\n\nAnother prevalent theory suggests that hōtō was invented by local warlord Takeda Shingen. The redevelopment of industry and commerce after World War II made tourism the prefecture's most profitable enterprise, and the image of Takeda Shingen was used frequently to promote the area's regional products. Locals sought to popularize hōtō as a tourist food by advertising it as the meal consumed by Takeda Shingen and his soldiers before each battle. Modern-day tourists can enjoy hōtō in numerous local restaurants and in rather unlikely locations such as coffee shops and ice cream parlors.\n\nA more extreme branch of these advertisements claims that the descendants of the Takeda clan introduced the recipe to the Tokugawa shogunate, who then used it to develop Nagoya's \"miso-nikomi udon\". The validity of this statement remains highly speculative.\n\nThe name \"hōtō\" is commonly thought to be a euphony of ; the name for \"udon\" flour after it has been kneaded and cut.\n\nThe \"kanji\" \"餺飥\" first appeared in Nara period dictionaries, and their reading is listed in dictionaries of the cloistered rule period as \"hautau\", showing that the pronunciation had already begun to transform into the reading \"hōtō\". Though \"hōtō\" was introduced to Japan far earlier than \"udon\", both names are believed to have originated from China. For instance, in modern-day Shanxi province of China, the word wonton is written with similar kanji (餛飩), and is pronounced \"hōtō.\"\n\nLocal linguists point out that the word is used in Edo period documents to describe all sorts of flour products, including flour made from non-wheat crops. In the local dialect, the word for flour is \"hatakimono\", while the local word for grinding crops into powder is \"hataku\". Some linguists theorize that hōtō actually originated from these local words when flour was turned into a popular dish.\n\nOther linguists disagree with the Chinese origin theory because there is no conclusive evidence that the word originated from China. They argue that popular acceptance of \"hōtō\" as a cuisine found exclusively in the Yamanashi area voids theories stating that the word was imported from overseas. However, from a historical viewpoint, the word \"hataku\" first appears in documents around 1484 in the Muromachi period, while \"hōtō\" or \"hautau\" can be found much earlier in writings such as \"The Pillow Book\". This contradicts the idea that \"hataku\" was the basis for the name of the dish.\n\nThe word can also be thought of as a euphony of \"宝刀\" or \"放蕩\". For \"宝刀\" (treasure sword), the given explanation is that Takeda Shingen cut the ingredients for the dish with his own sword. However, linguists tend to view this idea as a clever play on words in an advertisement campaign rather than a legitimate theory.\n\nThe dough is kneaded with bare hands in a wooden bowl, and stretched out to dry. It is then folded over and cut into large pieces with a kitchen knife. Unlike \"udon\", \"hōtō\" requires a tougher texture of dough, brought about by the amount of gluten, and the dough is not mixed with salt or left to sit. One peculiarity is that the noodles do not need to be parboiled; they are boiled raw along with the other ingredients.\n\nIt is generally thought that the best taste is brought out by boiling pumpkin in the \"miso\" soup until it becomes tender and melts into pieces. The \"dashi\" (soup base) is made from \"niboshi\", which are often left in the soup in home-cooked meals. Vegetables differ by season; negi, onions, and potatoes are commonly included during the summer, while taro, carrots, and Chinese cabbage make up the winter ingredients, along with various types of mushrooms such as \"shiitake\" and \"shimeji\". Pork or chicken can be included by preference. In terms of nutrition value, hōtō provides large amounts of starch from the noodles and potatoes, and vitamins and fiber from the soup and vegetables.\n\nMost hōtō noodles are wider and flatter compared to regular udon noodles. Though it is a hearty meal on its own, it can be served with white rice in the same manner as miso soup. Some restaurants will serve hōtō with very thick, heavy noodles in large iron pots to bring about a voluminous feeling reminiscent of \"nabemono\" and other steamboat dishes.\n\n refers to red bean soup with \"hōtō\" noodles added instead of the traditional \"mochi\" or\" shiratama\". Though red bean soup usually has a watery texture, \"azuki-bōtō\" consists of a thick, gluey stew, which is placed on the \"hōtō\" noodles and eaten like \"botamochi\". A local dish from Ōita prefecture called is extremely similar to \"azuki-bōtō\", except sweeter and considered to be more of a snack rather than a meal. In this sense, \"hōtō\" differs significantly from the modern categorization of \"udon\". \"Azuki-bōtō\" is not common, even within Yamanashi prefecture, and is usually only found in the old Kai province region. However, some local chain restaurants list \"azuki-bōtō\" on their regular menu.\n\nIt is customary for stores in Yamanashi prefecture to display Shingen Takeda’s Fūrinkazan battle flag to signify that \"hōtō\" is being served. According to the people of Yamanashi, \"hōtō\" and \"udon\" are completely different and unrelated foods (similar to the way is regarded by the people of Nagoya).\n\nTraditionally, each household would knead the dough from flour on their own. It was a popular dish amongst women who worked all day outside and needed to prepare dinner for a large farming family because the recipe and the process of making \"hōtō\" was not time-consuming or complicated. The soup usually consisted of larger quantities of vegetables than noodles, since flour was scarce and expensive. Many households reserved noodles as a treat served only to distinguished guests.\n\nAs modernization and industrialization of Japan continued, rice became the mainstay and the popularity of \"hōtō\" as a household dish dwindled. Supermarkets in Yamanashi now sell pre-packaged \"hōtō\" noodles and \"miso\" paste, and very few households go through the process of kneading their own flour anymore. \"Hōtō\" has gradually become standardized in taste and recipe, disappearing from household meals.\n\nMany chain restaurants in Yamanashi have picked up on \"hōtō\" as a marketable food. Some only serve it in the traditional style with a miso base, while others use the aforementioned red bean soup or \"gochujang\" to create more variety in taste. Non-traditional ingredients such as oysters, turtle, and crab may also be included in some cases. These versions are often regarded as monstrosities by local residents, as the original simple dish arose out of poverty, but they have gained popularity among tourists.\n\n"}

In Fall 2016, PepsiCo renamed the drink Pepsi Zero Sugar from Pepsi Max. It has nearly twice the caffeine of Pepsi's other cola beverages. Pepsi Zero Sugar contains 69 milligrams of caffeine per 355ml (12 fl oz), versus 36 milligrams in Diet Pepsi.\n\nDiet Pepsi Max was introduced in the United States on June 1, 2007, and in Canada in March 2008. \"Diet\" was dropped from the name in early 2009.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, PepsiCo announced several product changes which, among other changes, announced that Pepsi Max would be renamed in North America as Pepsi Zero Sugar. It is not known if it will come into trademark conflict with Coca-Cola, which uses the \"zero\" moniker for Pepsi Max's primary competitor Coca-Cola Zero, as well as Sprite Zero. The unrelated international drink will retain the Pepsi Max name.\n\nPepsi Zero Sugar competes in the energy drink market, as is implied by it being marketed as an 'Invigorating Cola.' Compared with other common energy drinks, Pepsi Zero Sugar gives the consumer a relatively low dose of caffeine. Pepsi Zero Sugar provides 5.75 mg caffeine per 30ml, while Red Bull provides 9.64 mg/30ml, AMP Energy provides 8.93 mg/30ml, Monster Energy provides 10 mg/30ml and Cocaine provides 33.14 mg/30ml. Pepsi Zero Sugar commercials present the beverage as an alternative to Diet Pepsi.\n\nIn 2007, the official marketing website for the product contained an 'odd cast' featuring a spoofed telethon urging viewers to donate yawns and uses the slogan 'WAKE UP PEOPLE'. Also, there was a featured commercial of a spoof on the Dallas Cowboys offensive coordinator yawning, when calling a play, thus, causing Tony Romo to be sacked, he was then replaced by Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones who gives him a Diet Pepsi Max. The scene then cuts away to the words \"WAKE UP PEOPLE\" while a voiceover shouts the slogan. An ad for the product that ran during the 2007 Super Bowl featured the song \"What Is Love\" by Haddaway, and showed people sleeping in inappropriate places and at inappropriate times, while bobbing their heads to the rhythm of the song. \n\nAfter the 2009 Super Bowl commercial aired, another, more recent campaign (including television and radio advertisements) has emphasized that the product is intended to be a men's diet cola. In one commercial, entitled \"I'm Good,\" men are shown in various dangerous and painful situations, and after each brief sequence, the \"injured\" actor states, \"I'm good!\" The take-away message is that men can handle anything, except for the taste of the average diet cola. Pepsi Max is intended to be the diet cola that men will enjoy. Another commercial entitled \"Ingredients\" shows men in various situations listing fictitious ingredients that essentially make Pepsi Max seem \"tough.\" The fictitious ingredients include pepper spray (as a sweetener), scorpion venom, crushed Viking bones, and the saliva of a rabid wolverine. The actors also state that the can is made from the hull of a nuclear submarine, and subsequently crush the cans in their bare hands, stating, \"I just crushed the hull of a nuclear submarine.\" This commercial ends with \"Maximum Taste, No Sugar, and Maybe Scorpion Venom. Pepsi Max, the First Diet Cola for Men,\" signaling a definitively different message than the one used in the \"WAKE UP PEOPLE\" advertisements. These more recent commercials have portrayed Pepsi Zero Sugar consumers as unremarkable, average, and heavy men, explicitly identifying the target market.\n\nFor Super Bowl XLIV in July 2010, Pepsi Max did a reboot of a well-received ad that ran during the 1995 Super Bowl XXIX. In the original ad, a pair of delivery drivers from Coca-Cola and Pepsi began a tentative friendship while listening to\"Get Together\" by The Youngbloods; in a peacemaking gesture, the two rivals taste each other's soda. But the friendship ends in humorous conflict when the Coca-Cola driver refuses to return the (superior) Pepsi product. The new ad riffed on the same story, with the drivers this time coming to blows over the then-Pepsi MAX at the expense of Coca-Cola's much more popular Coke Zero, with the song \"Why Can't We Be Friends?\" by the American funk band War as the soundtrack. \n\nIn 2011, Snoop Dogg was featured in an ad campaign around the time of Super Bowl XLV.\n\nIn early 2010, Pepsi released a limited edition called \"Pepsi Max Cease Fire.\" It is Diet Pepsi Lime in the Pepsi Max formula, and is being cross-promoted with Doritos Burn flavors. In July 2010, Pepsi Zero Sugar, then under the Pepsi Max name, was once again redesigned, this time to match its global branding. In the process, Pepsi Max began using the medium-sized \"smile.\" The \"Max\" typeface was changed to appear similar to what is used worldwide, and a distorted blue background borders the Pepsi globe.\nPepsi MAX was also advertised by \"Uncle Drew\" with the slogan \"Get Buckets.\"\n\nRichard Speight, Jr. is the \"Pepsi Max\" delivery guy for all commercials the last two years, with ads featuring major baseball and football stars, and also with Snoop Dogg and 4-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon, who worked with Pepsi Max in 2013 to create \"\", along with \"Road Trip to the Race Track\" two years prior.

Fitra is an Arabic word that is usually translated as “original disposition,” “natural constitution,” or “innate nature.”\n\nAccording to Islamic theology, human beings are born with an innate inclination of \"tawhid\" (Oneness), which is encapsulated in the \"fitra\" along with compassion, intelligence, ihsan and all other attributes that embody the concept of humanity. It is for this reason that some Muslims prefer to refer to those who embrace Islam as reverts rather than converts, as it is believed they are returning to a perceived pure state.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the religious meaning can be translated into the logical equivalence in philosophy, as Kant's concept of 'ought'. In a mystical context, it can connote intuition or insight and is similar to the Calvinist term \"Sensus divinitatis\".\n\nIn the 30th Chapter of the Quran, verse 30, the word Fitra is used in the context of the following verse \"Set thy Face to religion as a Hanif in the primordial nature from God upon which originated mankind there is no altering the creation of God; that is upright but most mankind know not.\" Fitra in the Quran is closely linked to the concept of Hanif (Original Monotheism) and Nabbi Al Ummi (The Illiterate Prophet or The Aboriginal Prophet). In a Hadith, the prophet Muhammad states that children are born upon Fitra and are then socialized into various religions. The Hadith states as follows, “The Prophet said, “No one is born except according to intrinsic nature, but their parents make them Jews, or Christians, or Magaians, just as a cow gives birth to a calf that is whole do you find it mutilated?”” \n\n\n\n"}

Pultost is found in two forms, spreadable and porous. The spreadable kind has a stronger taste.

It was originally made from by-products from the production of other Norwegian food called \"prim\". The ingredients are fermented milk, salt and caraway. The cheese is very low in fat.\n\nNorwegian dairy Tine produces pultost from the dairy in Nybergsund in Trysil. Tine make three qualities: a spreadable, soft type, called Løiten, a looser type with a dry and grainy texture, called Hedemark and a porous type called Lillehammer. Synnøve Finden is another manufacturer of pultost in Norway. The cheese mass is produced by Tine and further processing is performed by Synnøve Finden. Synnøve Finden is promoting two types pultost: Seterost and Hedmark.\n\nIn modern usage, \"pultost\" is among young Norwegian used as a derogatory offensive term with a certain attached irony.

{"id": "11573284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11573284", "title": "Four Roses", "text": "Four Roses\n\nFour Roses is a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey brand owned by the Kirin Brewery Company of Japan. Effective September 1, 2015, Brent Elliott is the master distiller of Four Roses.\n\nThe historical origin of the brand is not entirely clear. By some accounts, the brand was founded by Rufus Mathewson Rose and was probably named in honor of him, his brother Origen, and their two sons. However, several different stories have been told about the name's origin. Owner Kirin Brewery does not mention Rufus M. Rose in its version of the history, and refers instead to Paul Jones Jr. as the founder of the brand. The company says the brand name was trademarked in 1888 by Jones, who claimed it had been produced and sold as early as the 1860s. The Lawrenceburg, Kentucky distillery was built in 1910 in Spanish Mission-style architecture and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe brand was purchased by Seagram in 1943. Around the end of the 1950s, Seagram discontinued the sale of Four Roses bourbon within the United States in order to focus on sales of blended whiskey, although it introduced other brands of straight bourbons in the 1960s and 1970s, such as Benchmark and Eagle Rare. Four Roses Kentucky straight bourbon marketing was shifted to Europe and Asia, which were rapidly growing markets at the time. In the United States during this period, the Four Roses name was used on a blended whiskey, made mostly of neutral grain spirits and commonly seen as a sub-par \"rotgut\" brand. Four Roses continued to be unavailable as a straight bourbon in the US market for more than forty years until the brand ownership changed in 2002 after Seagram was purchased by Vivendi. That company then sold most of its brands to Diageo, which sold the Four Roses brand to Kirin, who discontinued the sale of blended whiskey to focus exclusively on Four Roses Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey.\n\nIn September 2018, Four Roses Distiller workers went on strike. One of the main grievances included a proposed two-tier contract in which newly hired employees would receive significantly lower wages and fewer benefit than existing employees. Such contracts had become common by this point in time, and striking workers hope to prevent their proliferation. Workers also argue that the two-tier proposal comes as the bourbon industry is experiencing tremendous economic growth, making the proposal unreasonable.\n\nFour Roses distills ten separate bourbons using two mash recipes and five yeast strains. From combining these ten bourbons the Four Roses distillery creates the standard \"yellow label\" expression. Single Barrel is made with only one of those ten bourbons. \n\nIn September 2007, Four Roses released a limited edition barrel proof bottle celebrating master distiller Jim Rutledge's 40 years in the industry. This release was limited to 1,442 bottles, and was unfiltered and uncut. Each bottle was hand numbered in gold paint and labeled detailing the barrel number, warehouse number, and percent of alcohol by volume for that barrel. Because this was a barrel strength release, alcohol content ranged between roughly 98 and 110 proof.\n\nFollowing the success of the 40th Anniversary bottle, Four Roses released another limited edition bottle celebrating the 120th anniversary of the trademark of the Four Roses name. This release was scheduled for May 2008, and consisted of approximately 2,238 commemorative bottles. The age of the whiskey will be approximately 12 years, and will also be uncut and unfiltered. Alcohol content will range between roughly 103 and 116 proof.\n\nDuring the September 2008 Kentucky Bourbon Festival, Four Roses announced the release of the 2008 Four Roses Collection. With barrels selected by the master distiller, the limited-edition small batch bourbon marries two separate flavors (aged approximately 10 and 13 years respectively) of Four Roses in a barrel proof release of about 3,500 bottles. This release is scheduled to be the first of a series of small batch releases.\n\n"}

Emping crackers have a slightly bitter taste. Emping snacks are available in markets plain (original), salty, spicy or sweet, depending on the addition of salt or caramelized sugar.\n\nEmping production is a home industry, with emping traditionally handmade in a labor-intensive process. The \"melinjo\" seeds are sauteed in a medium fire without oil, or sometimes using sand as a media. Some people boil the \"melinjo\" seeds to ease the peeling process. Both the softer outer skin and the harder inner skin of the seeds are peeled off by hand. Each of the gnetum seeds is whacked with a wooden hammer-like instrument or pressed with a stone cylinder to create flat and round emping, and later arranged in a tray made of weaved bamboo and sun-dried for a whole day. Each emping chip is commonly created from a single gnetum nut, although there are variants which combine several seeds to create larger emping with sizes similar to krupuk. These large emping, however, are often mixed with other types of starch, such as corn or tuber starch. There are two types of emping thickness available in markets, thin and thick. Thin emping are usually plain or salty, while thick emping are usually sweet, coated with caramelized sugar or spiced with chilli pepper.\n\nThe dried emping chips are collected, packed, and sold at market. Raw emping, as bought from traditional markets, are better when sun-dried first to reduce their humidity, then later fried with ample hot vegetable oil until they expand, becoming crispy and turning golden yellow. Emping are produced in many parts of Indonesia, from Pidie in Aceh to Sulawesi. However, the main production areas are in Java, with Karangtawang village in Kuningan Regency West Java, Bantul Regency in Yogyakarta, Klaten Regency, Batang Regency, and Magetan Regency in Central Java.\n\nRaw (unfried) emping are usually available in Indonesian traditional markets, while in snack stores, supermarkets, and restaurants mostly pre-packed, ready to eat emping are available. Most emping are plain flavoured (original), served with a pinch of salt. Emping have been exported to the Netherlands, USA and the Middle East.\nIn the Netherlands, due to historic ties with Indonesia, packaged dried (raw) emping is also available for home frying.

It can also be referred to as ″Wally's Game″. It is an eleven-round game played with two or more players. It requires two decks of cards with the jokers removed. Like other Rummy games, once the hands are dealt, the remainder of the cards are placed face down on the table. The top card from the deck is flipped face up and put beside the deck to start the discard pile.\n\nThe object of Three thirteen is to meld all the cards in your hand into sets. A set is defined by two parameters. The first type of set consists of three or more cards of the same rank, such as 4-4-4. The second type of set consists of a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, such as 4-5-6 of Hearts. Sets can contain more than three cards, however, you cannot include the same card in multiple sets. Once a player melds all of his cards into sets, he \"goes out\". He must still discard when \"going out\" and the remaining players are given one more draw to better their hands. The winner of a game of \"Three thirteen\" is the player who, at the end of the final round, has accumulated the fewest points.\n\nThe first dealer, chosen at random, deals three cards to each player. In each successive round, the deal passes to the left. In the second round, the dealer deals four cards to each player. With each successive round, the number of cards dealt to start the round increases until the eleventh and final round in which thirteen cards each are dealt.\n\nThe player to dealer's left is the first to play, and the play moves clockwise. When it is his turn, a player draws one of two cards. He can draw the top card from the discard pile or the top card from the top of the deck. Then the player must discard one card from his hand and place that card on top of the discard pile to conclude his turn. if a player goes out and it is false it is +20 points\n\nIn each round there is a designated wild card. The wild card is the card equal to the number of cards dealt. In the first round, three cards are dealt, so Threes are wild cards. In the second round four cards are dealt, so Fours are wild. When 11, 12, and 13 cards are dealt, the J, Q, and K are the respective wild cards. Wild cards can be used in place of any other card in making a group or sequence. A player can only use one wild card in each set.\n\nAt the end of a given round, each of a player's cards that cannot be placed into a set counts towards his score. \nAny wild cards that remain unused in a player's hand at the conclusion of a round count as 15 points.\n\n\nSome rules state that a player can make a set that consists only of wild cards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11749910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11749910", "title": "Cheese", "text": "Cheese\n\nCheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form. Some cheeses have molds on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\n\nOver a thousand types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.\n\nFor a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus \"Mucor miehei\", but others have been extracted from various species of the \"Cynara\" thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.\n\nCheese is valued for its portability, long life, and high content of fat, protein, calcium, and phosphorus. Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese; labels on packets of cheese often claim that a cheese should be consumed within three to five days of opening. Generally speaking, hard cheeses, such as Parmesan last longer than soft cheeses, such as Brie or goat's milk cheese. The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable.\n\nThere is some debate as to the best way to store cheese, but some experts say that wrapping it in cheese paper provides optimal results. Cheese paper is coated in a porous plastic on the inside, and the outside has a layer of wax. This specific combination of plastic on the inside and wax on the outside protects the cheese by allowing condensation on the cheese to be wicked away while preventing moisture from within the cheese escaping.\n\nA specialist seller of cheese is sometimes known as a \"cheesemonger\". Becoming an expert in this field requires some formal education and years of tasting and hands-on experience, much like becoming an expert in wine or cuisine. The cheesemonger is responsible for all aspects of the cheese inventory: selecting the cheese menu, purchasing, receiving, storage, and ripening.\n\nThe word \"cheese\" comes from Latin ', from which the modern word casein is also derived. The earliest source is from the proto-Indo-European root \"*kwat-\", which means \"to ferment, become sour\". The word \"cheese\" comes from ' (in Middle English) and ' or ' (in Old English). Similar words are shared by other West Germanic languages—West Frisian ', Dutch ', German ', Old High German '—all from the reconstructed West-Germanic form \"*kāsī\", which in turn is an early borrowing from Latin.\n\nThe \"Online Etymological Dictionary\" states that \"cheese\" comes from \"Old English cyse (West Saxon), cese (Anglian)...from West Germanic *kasjus (source also of Old Saxon kasi, Old High German chasi, German Käse, Middle Dutch case, Dutch kaas), from Latin caseus [for] \"cheese\" (source of Italian cacio, Spanish queso, Irish caise, Welsh caws).\" The \"Online Etymological Dictionary\" states that the word is of \"unknown origin; perhaps from a PIE root *kwat- \"to ferment, become sour\" (source also of Prakrit chasi \"buttermilk;\" Old Church Slavonic kvasu \"leaven; fermented drink,\" kyselu \"sour,\" -kyseti \"to turn sour;\" Czech kysati \"to turn sour, rot;\" Sanskrit kvathati \"boils, seethes;\" Gothic hwaþjan \"foam\"). Also compare fromage. Old Norse , Danish , Swedish are related to Latin \"broth, sauce, juice.'\"\n\nWhen the Romans began to make hard cheeses for their legionaries' supplies, a new word started to be used: ', from ', or \"molded cheese\" (as in \"formed\", not \"moldy\"). It is from this word that the French ', standard Italian ', Catalan ', Breton ', and Occitan ' (or ') are derived. Of the Romance languages, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Tuscan and Southern Italian dialects use words derived from ' (', ', ' and \"\" for example). The word \"cheese\" itself is occasionally employed in a sense that means \"molded\" or \"formed\". \"Head cheese\" uses the word in this sense. The term \"cheese\" is also used as a noun, verb and adjective in a number of figurative expressions (e.g., \"the big cheese\", \"to be cheesed off\" and \"cheesy lyrics\").\n\nCheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated, whether in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder, had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into being.\n\nEarliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around 8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated internal organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal, resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet from the stomach. There is a legend—with variations—about the discovery of cheese by an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk.\n\nThe earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5500 BCE and is found in what is now Kujawy, Poland, where strainers coated with milk-fat molecules have been found.\n\nCheesemaking may have begun independently of this by the pressing and salting of curdled milk to preserve it. Observation that the effect of making cheese in an animal stomach gave more solid and better-textured curds may have led to the deliberate addition of rennet. Early archeological evidence of Egyptian cheese has been found in Egyptian tomb murals, dating to about 2000 BCE.\n\nThe earliest cheeses were likely quite sour and salty, similar in texture to rustic cottage cheese or feta, a crumbly, flavorful Greek cheese. Cheese produced in Europe, where climates are cooler than the Middle East, required less salt for preservation. With less salt and acidity, the cheese became a suitable environment for useful microbes and molds, giving aged cheeses their respective flavors. The earliest ever discovered preserved cheese was found in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang, China, and it dates back as early as 1615 BCE.\n\nA 2018 paper published in \"Analytical Chemistry\" stated that the world's oldest cheese, dating to approximately 3200 years before present, was found in ancient Egyptian tombs.\n\nAncient Greek mythology credited Aristaeus with the discovery of cheese. Homer's \"Odyssey\" (8th century BCE) describes the Cyclops making and storing sheep's and goats' milk cheese (translation by Samuel Butler):\n\nBy Roman times, cheese was an everyday food and cheesemaking a mature art. Columella's \"De Re Rustica\" (c. 65 CE) details a cheesemaking process involving rennet coagulation, pressing of the curd, salting, and aging. Pliny's \"Natural History\" (77 CE) devotes a chapter (XI, 97) to describing the diversity of cheeses enjoyed by Romans of the early Empire. He stated that the best cheeses came from the villages near Nîmes, but did not keep long and had to be eaten fresh. Cheeses of the Alps and Apennines were as remarkable for their variety then as now. A Ligurian cheese was noted for being made mostly from sheep's milk, and some cheeses produced nearby were stated to weigh as much as a thousand pounds each. Goats' milk cheese was a recent taste in Rome, improved over the \"medicinal taste\" of Gaul's similar cheeses by smoking. Of cheeses from overseas, Pliny preferred those of Bithynia in Asia Minor.\n\nAs Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar newly settled neighbors, bringing their own cheese-making traditions, their own flocks and their own unrelated words for \"cheese\", cheeses in Europe diversified further, with various locales developing their own distinctive traditions and products. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers would encounter unfamiliar cheeses: Charlemagne's first encounter with a white cheese that had an edible rind forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's \"Life\" of the Emperor.\n\nThe British Cheese Board claims that Britain has approximately 700 distinct local cheeses; France and Italy have perhaps 400 each. (A French proverb holds there is a different French cheese for every day of the year, and Charles de Gaulle once asked \"how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?\") Still, the advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. Many cheeses today were first recorded in the late Middle Ages or after—cheeses like Cheddar around 1500, Parmesan in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791.\n\nIn 1546 \"The Proverbs of John Heywood\" claimed \"the moon is made of a greene cheese.\" (\"Greene\" may refer here not to the color, as many now think, but to being new or unaged.) Variations on this sentiment were long repeated and NASA exploited this myth for an April Fools' Day spoof announcement in 2006.\n\nUntil its modern spread along with European culture, cheese was nearly unheard of in east Asian cultures, in the pre-Columbian Americas, and only had limited use in sub-Mediterranean Africa, mainly being widespread and popular only in Europe, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and areas influenced by those cultures. But with the spread, first of European imperialism, and later of Euro-American culture and food, cheese has gradually become known and increasingly popular worldwide.\n\nThe first factory for the industrial production of cheese opened in Switzerland in 1815, but large-scale production first found real success in the United States. Credit usually goes to Jesse Williams, a dairy farmer from Rome, New York, who in 1851 started making cheese in an assembly-line fashion using the milk from neighboring farms. Within decades, hundreds of such dairy associations existed.\n\nThe 1860s saw the beginnings of mass-produced rennet, and by the turn of the century scientists were producing pure microbial cultures. Before then, bacteria in cheesemaking had come from the environment or from recycling an earlier batch's whey; the pure cultures meant a more standardized cheese could be produced.\n\nFactory-made cheese overtook traditional cheesemaking in the World War II era, and factories have been the source of most cheese in America and Europe ever since.\n\nIn 2014, world production of cheese from whole cow milk was 18.7 million tonnes, with the United States accounting for 29% (5.4 million tonnes) of the world total followed by Germany, France and Italy as major producers (table).\n\nOther 2014 world totals for processed cheese include:\n\nDuring 2015, Germany, France, Netherlands and Italy exported 10-14% of their produced cheese. The United States was a marginal exporter (5.3% of total cow milk production), as most of its output was for the domestic market.\n\nFrance, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Germany were the highest consumers of cheese in 2014, averaging per person.\n\nA required step in cheesemaking is separating the milk into solid curds and liquid whey. Usually this is done by acidifying (souring) the milk and adding rennet. The acidification can be accomplished directly by the addition of an acid, such as vinegar, in a few cases (paneer, queso fresco). More commonly starter bacteria are employed instead which convert milk sugars into lactic acid. The same bacteria (and the enzymes they produce) also play a large role in the eventual flavor of aged cheeses. Most cheeses are made with starter bacteria from the \"Lactococcus\", \"Lactobacillus\", or \"Streptococcus\" families. Swiss starter cultures also include \"Propionibacter shermani\", which produces carbon dioxide gas bubbles during aging, giving Swiss cheese or Emmental its holes (called \"eyes\").\n\nSome fresh cheeses are curdled only by acidity, but most cheeses also use rennet. Rennet sets the cheese into a strong and rubbery gel compared to the fragile curds produced by acidic coagulation alone. It also allows curdling at a lower acidity—important because flavor-making bacteria are inhibited in high-acidity environments. In general, softer, smaller, fresher cheeses are curdled with a greater proportion of acid to rennet than harder, larger, longer-aged varieties.\n\nWhile rennet was traditionally produced via extraction from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber of slaughtered young, unweaned calves, most rennet used today in cheesemaking is produced recombinantly. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey and, at most, may be present in cheese in trace quantities. In ripe cheese, the type and provenance of chymosin used in production cannot be determined.\n\nAt this point, the cheese has set into a very moist gel. Some soft cheeses are now essentially complete: they are drained, salted, and packaged. For most of the rest, the curd is cut into small cubes. This allows water to drain from the individual pieces of curd.\n\nSome hard cheeses are then heated to temperatures in the range of . This forces more whey from the cut curd. It also changes the taste of the finished cheese, affecting both the bacterial culture and the milk chemistry. Cheeses that are heated to the higher temperatures are usually made with thermophilic starter bacteria that survive this step—either \"Lactobacilli\" or \"Streptococci\".\n\nSalt has roles in cheese besides adding a salty flavor. It preserves cheese from spoiling, draws moisture from the curd, and firms cheese's texture in an interaction with its proteins. Some cheeses are salted from the outside with dry salt or brine washes. Most cheeses have the salt mixed directly into the curds.\n\nOther techniques influence a cheese's texture and flavor. Some examples are :\n\nMost cheeses achieve their final shape when the curds are pressed into a mold or form. The harder the cheese, the more pressure is applied. The pressure drives out moisture—the molds are designed to allow water to escape—and unifies the curds into a single solid body.\n\nA newborn cheese is usually salty yet bland in flavor and, for harder varieties, rubbery in texture. These qualities are sometimes enjoyed—cheese curds are eaten on their own—but normally cheeses are left to rest under controlled conditions. This aging period (also called ripening, or, from the French, \"affinage\") lasts from a few days to several years. As a cheese ages, microbes and enzymes transform texture and intensify flavor. This transformation is largely a result of the breakdown of casein proteins and milkfat into a complex mix of amino acids, amines, and fatty acids.\n\nSome cheeses have additional bacteria or molds intentionally introduced before or during aging. In traditional cheesemaking, these microbes might be already present in the aging room; they are simply allowed to settle and grow on the stored cheeses. More often today, prepared cultures are used, giving more consistent results and putting fewer constraints on the environment where the cheese ages. These cheeses include soft ripened cheeses such as Brie and Camembert, blue cheeses such as Roquefort, Stilton, Gorgonzola, and rind-washed cheeses such as Limburger.\n\nThere are many types of cheese, with around 500 different varieties recognized by the International Dairy Federation, more than 400 identified by Walter and Hargrove, more than 500 by Burkhalter, and more than 1,000 by Sandine and Elliker. The varieties may be grouped or classified into types according to criteria such as length of ageing, texture, methods of making, fat content, animal milk, country or region of origin, etc.—with these criteria either being used singly or in combination, but with no single method being universally used. The method most commonly and traditionally used is based on moisture content, which is then further discriminated by fat content and curing or ripening methods. Some attempts have been made to rationalise the classification of cheese—a scheme was proposed by Pieter Walstra which uses the primary and secondary starter combined with moisture content, and Walter and Hargrove suggested classifying by production methods which produces 18 types, which are then further grouped by moisture content.\n\nMoisture content (soft to hard)\nCategorizing cheeses by firmness is a common but inexact practice. The lines between \"soft\", \"semi-soft\", \"semi-hard\", and \"hard\" are arbitrary, and many types of cheese are made in softer or firmer variations. The main factor that controls cheese hardness is moisture content, which depends largely on the pressure with which it is packed into molds and aging time.\n\nFresh, whey and stretched curd cheeses\nThe main factor in the categorization of these cheeses is their age. Fresh cheeses without additional preservatives can spoil in a matter of days.\n\nContent (double cream, goat, ewe and water buffalo)\nSome cheeses are categorized by the source of the milk used to produce them or by the added fat content of the milk from which they are produced. While most of the world's commercially available cheese is made from cows' milk, many parts of the world also produce cheese from goats and sheep.\n\nSome cheeses are described by their fat content. Double cream cheeses are soft cheeses of cows' milk enriched with cream so that their fat in dry matter (FDM or FiDM) is 60–75%; triple cream cheeses are enriched to at least 75%.\n\nSoft-ripened and blue-vein\nThere are at least three main categories of cheese in which the presence of mold is a significant feature: soft ripened cheese, washed-rind cheese, and blue cheese.\n\nProcessed cheeses\nProcessed cheese is made from traditional cheese and emulsifying salts, often with the addition of milk, more salt, preservatives, and food coloring. It is inexpensive, consistent, and melts smoothly. It is sold packaged and either pre-sliced or unsliced, in a number of varieties. It is also available in aerosol cans in some countries.\n\nAt refrigerator temperatures, the fat in a piece of cheese is as hard as unsoftened butter, and its protein structure is stiff as well. Flavor and odor compounds are less easily liberated when cold. For improvements in flavor and texture, it is widely advised that cheeses be allowed to warm up to room temperature before eating. If the cheese is further warmed, to , the fats will begin to \"sweat out\" as they go beyond soft to fully liquid.\n\nAbove room temperatures, most hard cheeses melt. Rennet-curdled cheeses have a gel-like protein matrix that is broken down by heat. When enough protein bonds are broken, the cheese itself turns from a solid to a viscous liquid. Soft, high-moisture cheeses will melt at around , while hard, low-moisture cheeses such as Parmesan remain solid until they reach about . Acid-set cheeses, including halloumi, paneer, some whey cheeses and many varieties of fresh goat cheese, have a protein structure that remains intact at high temperatures. When cooked, these cheeses just get firmer as water evaporates.\n\nSome cheeses, like raclette, melt smoothly; many tend to become stringy or suffer from a separation of their fats. Many of these can be coaxed into melting smoothly in the presence of acids or starch. Fondue, with wine providing the acidity, is a good example of a smoothly melted cheese dish. Elastic stringiness is a quality that is sometimes enjoyed, in dishes including pizza and Welsh rarebit. Even a melted cheese eventually turns solid again, after enough moisture is cooked off. The saying \"you can't melt cheese twice\" (meaning \"some things can only be done once\") refers to the fact that oils leach out during the first melting and are gone, leaving the non-meltable solids behind.\n\nAs its temperature continues to rise, cheese will brown and eventually burn. Browned, partially burned cheese has a particular distinct flavor of its own and is frequently used in cooking (e.g., sprinkling atop items before baking them).\n\nA cheeseboard (or cheese course) may be served at the end of a meal, either replacing, before or following dessert. The British tradition is to have cheese after dessert, accompanied by sweet wines like Port. In France, cheese is consumed before dessert, with robust red wine. A cheeseboard typically has contrasting cheeses with accompaniments, such as crackers, biscuits, grapes, nuts, celery or chutney. A cheeseboard long was used to feature the variety of cheeses manufactured in Wisconsin, where the state legislature recognizes a \"cheesehead\" hat as a state symbol.\n\nThe nutritional value of cheese varies widely. Cottage cheese may consist of 4% fat and 11% protein while some whey cheeses are 15% fat and 11% protein, and triple-crème cheeses are 36% fat and 7% protein. In general, cheese is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of calcium, protein, phosphorus, sodium and saturated fat. A 28-gram (one ounce) serving of cheddar cheese contains about of protein and 202 milligrams of calcium. Nutritionally, cheese is essentially concentrated milk: it takes about of milk to provide that much protein, and to equal the calcium.\n\nCheese has the potential for promoting the growth of \"Listeria\" bacteria. \"Listeria monocytogenes\" can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection has the potential of seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system deficiency or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, unpasteurized milk, delicatessen meats, and hot dogs.\n\nA review of the medical literature published in 2012 noted that: \"Cheese consumption is the leading contributor of SF (saturated fat) in the U.S. diet, and therefore would be predicted to increase LDL-C (LDL cholesterol) and consequently increase the risk of CVD (cardiovascular disease).\" It found that: \"Based on results from numerous prospective observational studies and meta-analyses, most, but not all, have shown no association and in some cases an inverse relationship between the intake of milk fat containing dairy products and the risk of CVD, CHD (coronary heart disease), and stroke. A limited number of prospective cohort studies found no significant association between the intake of total full-fat dairy products and the risk of CHD or stroke...Most clinical studies showed that full-fat natural cheese, a highly fermented product, significantly lowers LDL-C compared with butter intake of equal total fat and saturated fat content.\"\n\nA number of food safety agencies around the world have warned of the risks of raw-milk cheeses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that soft raw-milk cheeses can cause \"serious infectious diseases including listeriosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis\". It is U.S. law since 1944 that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least 60 days. Australia has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent years exceptions have been made for Swiss Gruyère, Emmental and Sbrinz, and for French Roquefort. There is a trend for cheeses to be pasteurized even when not required by law.\n\nPregnant women may face an additional risk from cheese; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned pregnant women against eating soft-ripened cheeses and blue-veined cheeses, due to the listeria risk, which can cause miscarriage or harm the fetus.\n\nAlthough cheese is a vital source of nutrition in many regions of the world and is extensively consumed in others, its use is not universal.\n\nCheese is rarely found in Southeast and East Asian cuisines, presumably for historical reasons as dairy farming has historically been rare in these regions. However, Asian sentiment against cheese is not universal. In Nepal, the Dairy Development Corporation commercially manufactures cheese made from yak milk and a hard cheese made from either cow or yak milk known as chhurpi. The national dish of Bhutan, ema datshi, is made from homemade yak or mare milk cheese and hot peppers. In Yunnan, China, several ethnic minority groups produce Rushan and Rubing from cow's milk. Cheese consumption may be increasing in China, with annual sales doubling from 1996 to 2003 (to a still small 30 million U.S. dollars a year). Certain kinds of Chinese preserved bean curd are sometimes misleadingly referred to in English as \"Chinese cheese\" because of their texture and strong flavor.\n\nStrict followers of the dietary laws of Islam and Judaism must avoid cheeses made with rennet from animals not slaughtered in a manner adhering to halal or kosher laws. Both faiths allow cheese made with vegetable-based rennet or with rennet made from animals that were processed in a halal or kosher manner. Many less orthodox Jews also believe that rennet undergoes enough processing to change its nature entirely and do not consider it to ever violate kosher law. (See \"Cheese and kashrut\".) As cheese is a dairy food, under kosher rules it cannot be eaten in the same meal with any meat.\n\nRennet derived from animal slaughter, and thus cheese made with animal-derived rennet, is not vegetarian. Most widely available vegetarian cheeses are made using rennet produced by fermentation of the fungus \"Mucor miehei\". Vegans and other dairy-avoiding vegetarians do not eat conventional cheese, but some vegetable-based cheese substitutes (soy or almond) are used as substitutes.\n\nEven in cultures with long cheese traditions, consumers may perceive some cheeses that are especially pungent-smelling, or mold-bearing varieties such as Limburger or Roquefort, as unpalatable. Such cheeses are an acquired taste because they are processed using molds or microbiological cultures, allowing odor and flavor molecules to resemble those in rotten foods. One author stated: \"An aversion to the odor of decay has the obvious biological value of steering us away from possible food poisoning, so it is no wonder that an animal food that gives off whiffs of shoes and soil and the stable takes some getting used to.\"\n\nCollecting cheese labels is called \"tyrosemiophilia\".\n\nIn the 19th century, \"cheese\" was used as a figurative way of saying \"the proper thing\"; this usage comes \"from Urdu chiz \"a thing,\" from Persian chiz, from Old Persian...ciš-ciy [which means] \"something.\" The term \"cheese\" in this sense was \"[p]icked up by [colonial] British in India by 1818 and [was also] used in the sense of \"a big thing\", for example in the expression \"he's the real chiz\". The expression \"big cheese\" was attested in use in 1914 to mean an \"important person\"; this is likely \"American English in origin\". The expression \"to cut a big cheese\" was used to mean \"to look important\"; this figurative expression referred to the huge wheels of cheese displayed by cheese retailers as a publicity stunt. The phrase \"cut the cheese\" also became an American slang term meaning to flatulate. The word \"cheese\" has also had the meaning of \"an ignorant, stupid person.\"\n\nOther figurative meanings involve the word \"cheese\" used as a verb. To \"cheese\" is recorded as meaning to \"stop (what one is doing), run off,\" in 1812 (this was \"thieves' slang\"). To be \"cheesed off\" means to be annoyed. The expression \"say cheese\" in a photograph-taking context (when the photographer wishes the people to smile for the photo), which means \"to smile\" dates from 1930 (the word was probably chosen because the \"ee\" encourages people to make a smile). The verb \"cheese\" was used as slang for \"be quiet\" in the early 19th century in Britain. The fictional \"...notion that the moon is made of green cheese as a type of a ridiculous assertion is from 1520s\". The figurative expression \"to make cheeses\" is an 1830s phrase referring to schoolgirls who amuse themselves by \"...wheeling rapidly so one's petticoats blew out in a circle then dropping down so they came to rest inflated and resembling a wheel of cheese\". In video game slang \"to cheese it\" means to win a game by using a strategy that requires minimal skill and knowledge or that exploits a glitch or flaw in game design.\n\nThe adjective \"cheesy\" has two meanings. The first is literal, and means \"cheese-like\"; this definition is attested to from the late 14th century (e.g., \"a cheesy substance oozed from the broken jar\"). In the late 19th century, medical writers used the term \"cheesy\" in a more literal sense, \"to describe morbid substances found in tumors, decaying flesh, etc.\" The adjective also has a figurative sense, meaning \"cheap, inferior\"; this use \"... is attested from 1896, perhaps originally U.S. student slang\". In the late 19th century in British slang, \"cheesy\" meant \"fine, showy\"; this use is attested to in the 1850s. In writing lyrics for pop music, rock music or musical theatre, \"cheesy\" is a pejorative term which means \"blatantly artificial\" (\"OED\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11759764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11759764", "title": "Shen (Chinese religion)", "text": "Shen (Chinese religion)\n\nShen (神) is the Chinese word for \"god\", \"deity\", \"spirit\" or \"theos\". This single Chinese term expresses a range of similar, yet differing, meanings. The first meaning may refer to spirits or gods that are intimately involved in the affairs of the world. Spirits generate entities like rivers, mountains, thunder and stars. A second meaning of shen refers to the human spirit or psyche; it is the basic power or agency within humans that accounts for life, and in order to further life to its fullest potential the spirit must be grown and cultivated. A third understanding of shen describes an entity as spiritual in the sense of inspiring awe or wonder because it combines categories usually kept separate, or it cannot be comprehended through normal concepts.\n\nA starting point for an understanding of shen is the meeting place of Heaven and Earth, which is mankind. Heaven is the origin of the spiritual aspect of humanity and provides ongoing spiritual influences, while Earth is the origin of the physical aspect of humankind. The ongoing harmonious interaction of Heaven and Earth in man is essential to maintaining life. In Chinese religious tradition, balancing yin and yang is important to provide organization of life and prevent harm to body and spirit.\n\n\"Shén\" (in rising 2nd tone) is the Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 神 \"spirit; god, deity; spiritual, supernatural; awareness, consciousness etc\". Reconstructions of \"shén\" in Middle Chinese (ca. 6th-10th centuries CE) include \"dź'jěn\" (Bernhard Karlgren, substituting \"j\" for his \"yod medial\"), \"źiɪn\" (Zhou Fagao), \"ʑin\" (Edwin G. Pulleyblank, \"Late Middle\"), and \"zyin\" (William H. Baxter). Reconstructions of \"shén\" in Old Chinese (ca. 6th-3rd centuries BCE) include *\"djěn\" (Karlgren), *\"zdjien\" (Zhou), *\"djin\" (Li Fanggui), *\"Ljin\" (Baxter), and *\"m-lin\" (Axel Schuessler).\n\nAlthough the etymological origin of \"shen\" is uncertain, Schuessler (2007:458) notes a possible Sino-Tibetan etymology; compare Chepang \"gliŋh\" \"spirit of humans\".\n\nThe Chinese \"shen\" 神 \"spirit; etc.\" is also in other East Asian languages. The Japanese \"Kanji\" 神 is pronounced \"shin\" (しん) or \"jin\" (じん) in \"On'yomi\" (Chinese reading), and \"kami\" (かみ), \"kō\" (こう), or \"tamashii\" (たましい) in \"Kun'yomi\" (Japanese reading). The Korean \"Hanja\" 神 is pronounced \"sin\" (신).\n\nThe \"Zihui\" dictionary notes that 神 had a special pronunciation \"shēn\" (level 1st tone, instead of usual 2nd \"shén\") in the name Shen Shu 神荼, one of two \"gods of the Eastern Sea\", along with Yu Lu 鬱壘.\n\nIn the Vietnamese language, it is pronounced as \"thần\".\n\n\"Shen\"'s polysemous meanings developed diachronically over three millennia. The \"Hanyu dazidian\", an authoritative historical dictionary, distinguishes one meaning for \"shēn\" (\"Name of a deity (神名)) and eleven meanings for \"shén\" 神 translated below:\n\nThis dictionary entry for \"shen\" lists early usage examples, and many of these 11 meanings were well attested prior to the Han Dynasty. Chinese classic texts use \"shen\" in meanings 1 \"spirit; god\", 2 \"spirit, mind; attention\", 3 \"expression; state of mind\", 5 \"supernatural\", and meaning 6 \"esteem\". The earliest examples of meaning 4 \"portrait\" are in Song Dynasty texts. Meanings 7-9 first occur in early Chinese dictionaries; the \"Erya\" defines \"shen\" in meanings 7 \"govern\" and 8 \"cautious\" (and 6, which is attested elsewhere), and the \"Guangya\" defines meaning 9 \"display\". Meaning 10 gives three usages in Chinese dialects (technically \"topolects\", see Fangyan). Meaning 11 \"a surname\" is exemplified in Shennong (\"Divine Farmer\"), the culture hero and inventor of agriculture in Chinese mythology.\n\nThe Chinese language has many compounds of \"shen\". For instance, it is compounded with \"tian\" 天 \"sky; heaven; nature; god\" in \"tianshen\" 天神 \"celestial spirits; heavenly gods; deities; (Buddhism) deva\", with \"shan\" 山 \"mountain\" in \"shanshen\" 山神 \"mountain spirit\", and \"hua\" 話 \"speech; talk; saying; story\" in \"shenhua\" 神話 \"mythology; myth; fairy tale\". Several \"shen\" \"spirit; god\" compounds use names for other supernatural beings, for example, \"ling\" 靈 \"spirit; soul\" in \"shenling\" 神靈 \"gods; spirits, various deities\", \"qi\" 祇 \"earth spirit\" in \"shenqi\" 神祇 \"celestial and terrestrial spirits\", \"xian\" 仙 \"Xian (Taoism), transcendent\" in \"shenxian\" 神仙 \"spirits and immortals; divine immortal\", \"guai\" 怪 \"spirit; devil; monster\" in \"shenguai\" 神怪 \"spirits and demons; gods and spirits\", and \"gui\" 鬼 \"ghost, goblin; demon, devil\" in \"guishen\" 鬼神 \"ghosts and spirits; supernatural beings\". The earliest discovered character form for shen suggests two components. The right side of the character gives the basic meaning and pronunciation, as well as providing a graphic representation of flashing lightning from the clouds. This visual displays ancient people’s belief that lightning was the manifestation of god.1 The left side displays a modified character shi which pertains to ritual ceremonies, worship, or prayer. This concept originally referred to stone table used for offering ceremonial sacrifices to the gods. \n\nWing-Tsit Chan distinguishes four philosophical meanings of this \"guishen\": \"spiritual beings\", \"ancestors\", \"gods and demons\", and \"positive and negative spiritual forces\".\n\nThe primary meaning of \"shen\" is translatable as English \"spirit, spirits, Spirit, spiritual beings; celestial spirits; ancestral spirits\" or \"god, gods, God; deity, deities, supernatural beings\", etc. \"Shen\" is sometimes loosely translated as \"soul\", but Chinese hun and po distinguishes \"hun\" 魂 \"spiritual soul\" and \"po\" 魄 \"physical soul\". Instead of struggling to translate \"shen\" 神, it can be transliterated as a loanword. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (2nd ed.) defines \"shen\", \"In Chinese philosophy: a god, person of supernatural power, or the spirit of a dead person.\"\n\nIn acupuncture, \"shen\" is a pure spiritual energy devoid of memory and personality traits, whereas \"hun\" is the spiritual energy associated with the personality and \"po\" the energy tied to the sustenance of the physical body. In this system, \"shen\" resides in the heart and departs first at death, \"hun\" resides in the liver and departs second, and \"po\" resides in the lungs and departs last.\n\n\"Shen\" plays a central role in Christian translational disputes over Chinese terms for God. Among the early Chinese \"god; God\" names, \"shangdi\" 上帝 or \"di\" was the Shang term, \"tian\" 天 was the Zhou term, and \"shen\" was a later usage (see Feng Yu-Lan 1952:22–6, 30–1). Modern terms for \"God\" include \"shangdi\", \"zhu\" 主, \"tianzhu\" 天主 (esp. Catholics), and \"shen\" 神 (esp. Protestants).\n\nThe character 神 for \"shen\" exemplifies the most common class in Chinese character classification: \"xíngshēngzì\" 形聲字 \"pictophonetic compounds, semantic-phonetic compounds\", which combine a radical (or classifier) that roughly indicates meaning and a phonetic that roughly indicates pronunciation. In this case, 神 combines the \"altar/worship radical\" 礻or 示 and a phonetic of \"shēn\" 申 \"9th Earthly Branch; extend, stretch; prolong, repeat\". Compare this phonetic element differentiated with the \"person radical\" in \"shen\" 伸 \"stretch\", the \"silk radical\" in \"shen\" 紳 \"official's sash\", the \"mouth radical\" in \"shen\" 呻 \"chant, drone\", the \"stone radical\" in \"shen\" 砷 \"arsenic\", the \"earth radical\" in \"kun\" 坤 \"soil\", and the \"big radical\" in \"yan\" 奄 \"cover\". (See the List of Kangxi radicals.)\n\nChinese \"shen\" 申 \"extend\" was anciently a phonetic loan character for \"shen\" 神 \"spirit\". The Mawangdui Silk Texts include two copies of the Dao De Jing and the \"A Text\" writes \"shen\" interchangeably as 申and 神: \"If one oversees all under heaven in accord with the Way, demons have no spirit. It is not that the demons have no spirit, but that their spirits do not harm people.\" (chap. 60, tr. Mair 1990:30). The \"Shuowen Jiezi\" defines \"shen\" 申 as \"shen\" 神 and says that in the 7th lunar month when \"yin\" forces increase, bodies \"shenshu\" 申束 \"bind up\".\n\nThe earliest written forms of \"shen\" 神 \"spirit; god\" occur in Zhou dynasty bronzeware script and Qin dynasty seal script characters (compare the variants shown on the \"Chinese etymology\" link below). Although 神 has not been identified in Shang dynasty oracle bone script records, the phonetic\" shen\" 申 has. Paleographers interpret the Oracle script of 申 as a pictograph of a \"lightning bolt\". This was graphically differentiated between \"dian\" 電 \"lightning; electricity\" with the \"cloud radical\" and \"shen\" 神 with the \"worship radical\", semantically suggesting both \"lightning\" and \"spirits\" coming down from the heavens.\n\n\n\n"}

This action can either be conscious or unconscious. Those affected with dermatophagia typically bite the skin around the nails, leading to bleeding and discoloration over time. Some people also bite on their skin on their finger knuckles which can lead to pain and bleeding just by moving their fingers. It has been proposed that dermatodaxia would be a more fitting term for this disorder, as the suffix '-phagia' implies that the skin is being eaten rather than simply bitten. In most cases of dermatophagia in humans, the skin is only bitten with no consumption. In herpetology, dermatophagia is used to correctly describe the act in which amphibians and reptiles eat the skin they shed, but this is not what occurs in humans. Those diagnosed with this disorder do not develop wounds on the bitten areas of their hands or lose any skin. Instead, they experience a thickening of the skin being repeatedly bitten. This information implies that the skin is simply being bitten and chewed rather than eaten. Contemporary research suggests a link between impulse control disorders and obsessive–compulsive disorders, and this was addressed in the DSM-5 when dermatophagia and other related disorders were classified as 'other specified obsessive-compulsive related disorders' and are given the specification of body focused repetitive behavior. Further information on OCD, other anxiety disorders, dermatophagia and other related body focused repetitive behaviors can be found in the DSM-5\n\nPeople with dermatophagia chew their skin out of compulsion, and can do so on a variety of places on their body. Those with dermatophagia typically chew the skin surrounding their fingernails and joints. They also chew on the inside of their mouth, cheeks, and/or lips, causing blisters in and outside of the mouth. If the behavior is left unchecked for an extended period, calluses may start to develop where most of the biting is done.\n\nSkin chewing can be bolstered by times of apprehension and other unpleasant events. Blisters in particular can cause a feeling of desire to pull or bite off the affected skin and nails (since the skin is dead, thus easily pulled off), which could be detrimental, causing infection. Another disorder, known as excoriation disorder, the repetitive action of uncontrollably picking at one's skin, can sometimes accompany dermatophagia. Dermatophagia differs from excoriation disorder in that the repetitive motion affected persons partake in is the biting of the skin. People who have dermatophagia can also be prone to infection as when they bite their fingers so frequently, they make themselves vulnerable to bacteria seeping in and causing infection. Dermatophagia can be considered a \"sister\" disorder to trichophagia, which involves compulsively biting and eating one's hair.\n\nThere is not yet a known way to remedy this in adults. Small things can be done to delay the urge a bit, such as chewing gum, and chewing on a soft drink straw.\n\nThere is no therapy known to effectively treat dermatophagia, however there have been attempts at stopping sufferers from being able to chew on their skin. One notable method that is currently in development is focused on in curbing dermatophagia in children with cerebral palsy. This method is known as the PLAY (Protecting Little and Adolescent hands) hands protective glove. This method of intervention involves small, non-invasive plastic brackets being placed around the affected fingers. These brackets do not hinder movement or tactile feedback, and they are constructed from non-toxic durable plastic that can withstand the force of chewing. Presently PLAY hands protective gloves exist in concept and prototype only, but this intervention method could improve the quality of life of those suffering from CP-induced dermatophagia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11789724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11789724", "title": "Absinthe", "text": "Absinthe\n\nAbsinthe (; ) is historically described as a distilled, highly alcoholic beverage (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof). It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of \"Artemisia absinthium\" (\"grand wormwood\"), together with green anise, sweet fennel, and other medicinal and culinary herbs.\n\nAbsinthe traditionally has a natural green colour, but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as \"\"\"\" (the green fairy). It is sometimes mistakenly referred to as a liqueur, but it is not traditionally bottled with added sugar and is, therefore, classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.\n\nAbsinthe originated in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland in the late 18th century. It rose to great popularity as an alcoholic drink in late 19th- and early 20th-century France, particularly among Parisian artists and writers. The consumption of absinthe was opposed by social conservatives and prohibitionists, partly due to its association with bohemian culture. Absinthe drinkers included Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, Aleister Crowley, Erik Satie, Edgar Allan Poe, Lord Byron, Alfred Jarry, and Marilyn Manson. \n\nAbsinthe has often been portrayed as a dangerously addictive psychoactive drug and hallucinogen. The chemical compound thujone, which is present in the spirit in trace amounts, was blamed for its alleged harmful effects. By 1915, absinthe had been banned in the United States and in much of Europe, including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary, yet it has not been demonstrated to be any more dangerous than ordinary spirits. Recent studies have shown that absinthe's psychoactive properties have been exaggerated, apart from that of the alcohol.\n\nA revival of absinthe began in the 1990s following the adoption of modern European Union food and beverage laws which removed long-standing barriers to its production and sale. By the early 21st century, nearly 200 brands of absinthe were being produced in a dozen countries, most notably in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe French word \"absinthe\" can refer either to the alcoholic beverage or, less commonly, to the actual wormwood plant, with \"grande absinthe\" being \"Artemisia absinthium\", and \"petite absinthe\" being \"Artemisia pontica\". The Latin name \"artemisia\" comes from the Greek \"wormwood\" and the latter from Artemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt. \"Absinthe\" is derived from the Latin \"absinthium\", which in turn comes from the Greek \"apsínthion\", \"wormwood\". The use of \"Artemisia absinthium\" in a drink is attested in Lucretius' \"De Rerum Natura\" (I 936–950), where Lucretius indicates that a drink containing wormwood is given as medicine to children in a cup with honey on the brim to make it drinkable. Some claim that the word means \"undrinkable\" in Greek, but it may instead be linked to the Persian root \"spand\" or \"aspand\", or the variant \"esfand\", which meant \"Peganum harmala\", also called Syrian Rue—although it is not actually a variety of rue, another famously bitter herb. That \"Artemisia absinthium\" was commonly burned as a protective offering may suggest that its origins lie in the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root \"*spend\", meaning \"to perform a ritual\" or \"make an offering\". Whether the word was a borrowing from Persian into Greek, or from a common ancestor of both, is unclear. Alternatively, the Greek word may originate in a pre-Greek substrate word, marked by the non-Indo-European consonant complex νθ (-nth). Alternative spellings for absinthe include \"absinth\", \"absynthe\" and \"absenta\". \"Absinth\" (without the final \"e\") is a spelling variant most commonly applied to absinthes produced in central and eastern Europe, and is specifically associated with Bohemian-style absinthes.\n\nThe precise origin of absinthe is unclear. The medical use of wormwood dates back to ancient Egypt and is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus, c. 1550 BC. Wormwood extracts and wine-soaked wormwood leaves were used as remedies by the ancient Greeks. Moreover, there is evidence of a wormwood-flavoured wine in ancient Greece called \"absinthites oinos\".\n\nThe first evidence of absinthe dates to the 18th century in the sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise and fennel. According to popular legend, it began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, Switzerland around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was passed on to the Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold it as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters in 1797 and opened the first absinthe distillery named Dubied Père et Fils in Couvet with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France under the company name Maison Pernod Fils. Pernod Fils remained one of the most popular brands of absinthe until the drink was banned in France in 1914.\n\nAbsinthe's popularity grew steadily through the 1840s, when it was given to French troops as a malaria preventive, and the troops brought home their taste for it. Absinthe became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets by the 1860s that the hour of 5 p.m. was called \"l'heure verte\" (\"the green hour\"). It was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price to drop sharply, and the French were drinking 36 million litres per year by 1910, compared to their annual consumption of almost 5 billion litres of wine.\n\nAbsinthe was exported widely from France and Switzerland and attained some degree of popularity in other countries, including Spain, Great Britain, USA, and Czechia. It was never banned in Spain or Portugal, and its production and consumption have never ceased. It gained a temporary spike in popularity there during the early 20th century, corresponding with the Art Nouveau and Modernism aesthetic movements.\n\nNew Orleans has a cultural association with absinthe and is credited as the birthplace of the Sazerac, perhaps the earliest absinthe cocktail. The \"Old Absinthe House\" bar on Bourbon Street sold absinthe since the first half of the 19th century. Its Catalan lease-holder Cayetano Ferrer named it the \"Absinthe Room\" in 1874 because of the popularity of the drink, which was served in the Parisian style. It was frequented by Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Aleister Crowley, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nAbsinthe became associated with violent crimes and social disorder, and one modern writer claims that this trend was spurred by fabricated claims and smear campaigns, which he claims were orchestrated by the temperance movement and the wine industry. One critic claimed:\n\nEdgar Degas's 1876 painting \"L'Absinthe\" can be seen at the Musée d'Orsay epitomising the popular view of absinthe addicts as sodden and benumbed, and Émile Zola described its effects in his novel \"L'Assommoir\". Swiss farmer Jean Lanfray murdered his family in 1905 and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe, but that was overlooked or ignored, placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe. The Lanfray murders were the tipping point in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition collected more than 82,000 signatures to ban it in Switzerland, and a referendum was held on 5 July 1908. It was approved by voters and the prohibition of absinthe was written into the Swiss constitution.\n\nIn 1906, Belgium and Brazil banned the sale and distribution of absinthe, although these were not the first countries to take such action. It had been banned as early as 1898 in the colony of the Congo Free State. The Netherlands banned it in 1909, Switzerland in 1910, the United States in 1912, and France in 1914.\n\nThe prohibition of absinthe in France would eventually lead to the popularity of pastis, and to a lesser extent, ouzo, and other anise-flavoured spirits that do not contain wormwood. Following the conclusion of the First World War, production of the Pernod Fils brand was resumed at the Banus distillery in Catalonia, Spain (where absinthe was still legal), but gradually declining sales saw the cessation of production in the 1960s. In Switzerland, the ban served only to drive the production of absinthe underground. Clandestine home distillers produced colourless absinthe (\"la Bleue\"), which was easier to conceal from the authorities. Many countries never banned absinthe, notably Britain, where it had never been as popular as in continental Europe.\n\nBritish importer BBH Spirits began to import Hill's Absinth from Czechia in the 1990s, as the UK had never formally banned it, and this sparked a modern resurgence in its popularity. It began to reappear during a revival in the 1990s in countries where it was never banned. Forms of absinthe available during that time consisted almost exclusively of Czech, Spanish, and Portuguese brands that were of recent origin, typically consisting of Bohemian-style products. Connoisseurs considered these of inferior quality and not representative of the 19th century spirit. In 2000, La Fée Absinthe became the first commercial absinthe distilled and bottled in France since the 1914 ban, but it is now one of dozens of brands that are produced and sold within France.\nIn the Netherlands, the restrictions were challenged by Amsterdam wineseller Menno Boorsma in July 2004, thus confirming the legality of absinthe once again. Similarly, Belgium lifted its long-standing ban on January 1, 2005, citing a conflict with the adopted food and beverage regulations of the Single European Market. In Switzerland, the constitutional ban was repealed in 2000 during an overhaul of the national constitution, although the prohibition was written into ordinary law instead. That law was later repealed and it was made legal on March 1, 2005.\n\nThe drink was never officially banned in Spain, although it began to fall out of favour in the 1940s and almost vanished into obscurity. The Catalan region has seen significant resurgence since 2007 when one producer established operations there. Absinthe has never been illegal to import or manufacture in Australia, although importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing \"oil of wormwood\". In 2000, an amendment made all wormwood species prohibited herbs for food purposes under \"Food Standard 1.4.4. Prohibited and Restricted Plants and Fungi\". However, this amendment was found inconsistent with other parts of the preexisting Food Code, and it was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system. These events were erroneously reported by the media as it being reclassified from a \"prohibited\" product to a \"restricted\" product.\n\nIn 2007, the French Lucid brand became the first genuine absinthe to receive a COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) for importation into the United States since 1912, following independent efforts by representatives from Lucid and Kübler to overturn the long-standing US ban. In December 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte produced by St. George Spirits of Alameda, California became the first brand of American-made absinthe produced in the United States since the ban. Since that time, other micro-distilleries have started producing small batches in the US.\n\nThe 21st century has seen new types of absinthe, including various frozen preparations which have become increasingly popular. The French Absinthe Ban of 1915 was repealed in May 2011 following petitions by the Fédération Française des Spiritueux which represents French distillers.\n\nMost countries have no legal definition for absinthe, whereas the method of production and content of spirits such as whisky, brandy, and gin are globally defined and regulated. Therefore, producers are at liberty to label a product as \"absinthe\" or \"absinth\" without regard to any specific legal definition or quality standards.\n\nProducers of legitimate absinthes employ one of two historically defined processes to create the finished spirit: distillation, or cold mixing. In the sole country (Switzerland) that does possess a legal definition of absinthe, distillation is the only permitted method of production.\n\nDistilled absinthe employs a method of production similar to that of high quality gin. Botanicals are initially macerated in distilled base alcohol before being redistilled to exclude bitter principles, and impart the desired complexity and texture to the spirit.\n\nThe distillation of absinthe first yields a colourless distillate that leaves the alembic at around 72% ABV. The distillate may be reduced and bottled clear, to produce a \"Blanche\" or \"la Bleue\" absinthe, or it may be coloured to create a \"verte\" using natural or artificial colouring.\n\nTraditional absinthes obtain their green colour strictly from the chlorophyll of whole herbs, which is extracted from the plants during the secondary maceration. This step involves steeping plants such as petite wormwood, hyssop, and melissa (among other herbs) in the distillate. Chlorophyll from these herbs is extracted in the process, giving the drink its famous green colour.\n\nThis step also provides a herbal complexity that is typical of high quality absinthe. The natural colouring process is considered critical for absinthe ageing, since the chlorophyll remains chemically active. The chlorophyll serves a similar role in absinthe that tannins do in wine or brown liquors.\n\nAfter the colouring process, the resulting product is diluted with water to the desired percentage of alcohol. The flavour of absinthe is said to improve materially with storage, and many pre-ban distilleries aged their absinthe in settling tanks before bottling.\n\nMany modern absinthes are produced using a cold mix process. This inexpensive method of production does not involve distillation, and is regarded as inferior in the same way that cheaper \"compound\" gin is regarded as inferior to \"distilled\" gin. The cold mixing process involves the simple blending of flavouring essences and artificial colouring in commercial alcohol, in similar fashion to most flavoured vodkas and inexpensive liqueurs and cordials. Some modern cold mixed absinthes have been bottled at strengths approaching 90% ABV. Others are presented simply as a bottle of plain alcohol with a small amount of powdered herbs suspended within it.\n\nThe lack of a formal legal definition for absinthe in most countries enables some cold mixing producers to falsify advertising claims, such as referring to their products as \"distilled\", since the base alcohol itself was created at some point through distillation. This is used as justification to sell these inexpensively produced absinthes at prices comparable to more authentic absinthes that are distilled directly from whole herbs. In the only country that possesses a formal legal definition of absinthe (Switzerland), anything made via the cold mixed process cannot be sold as absinthe.\n\nAbsinthe is traditionally prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled from a white grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes. The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called \"the holy trinity.\" Many other herbs may be used as well, such as petite wormwood (\"Artemisia pontica\" or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, star anise, angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.\n\nOne early recipe was included in 1864's The English and Australian Cookery Book. It directed the maker to \"Take of the tops of wormwood, four pounds; root of angelica, calamus aromaticus, aniseed, leaves of dittany, of each one ounce; alcohol, four gallons. Macerate these substances during eight days, add a little water, and distil by a gentle fire, until two gallons are obtained. This is reduced to a proof spirit, and a few drops of the oil of aniseed added.\"\n\nAdding to absinthe's negative reputation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, unscrupulous makers of the drink omitted the traditional colouring phase of production in favour of adding toxic copper salts to artificially induce a green tint. This practice may be responsible for some of the alleged toxicity historically associated with this beverage. Many modern day producers resort to similar (but non-deadly) shortcuts, including the use of artificial food colouring to create the green colour. Additionally, at least some cheap absinthes produced before the ban were reportedly adulterated with poisonous antimony trichloride, reputed to enhance the louching effect.\n\nAbsinthe may also be naturally coloured pink or red using rose or hibiscus flowers. This was referred to as a \"rose\" (pink) or \"rouge\" (red) absinthe. Only one historical brand of rose absinthe has been documented.\n\nAbsinthe was historically bottled at 45-74% percent ABV. Some modern Franco–Suisse absinthes are bottled at up to 83.2% ABV, while some modern, cold-mixed bohemian-style absinthes are bottled at up to 89.9% ABV.\n\nThe modern day interest in absinthe has spawned a rash of absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka or alcohol to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears little resemblance to the genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. In at least one documented case, a person suffered acute kidney injury after drinking 10 ml of pure wormwood oil—a dose much higher than that found in absinthe.\n\nIn baking, Pernod Anise is often used as a substitute if absinthe is unavailable. In preparing the classic New Orleans-style Sazerac cocktail, various substitutes such as Pastis, Pernod, Ricard, and Herbsaint have been used to replace absinthe.\n\nThe traditional French preparation involves placing a sugar cube on top of a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the \"louche\" (Fr. \"opaque\" or \"shady\", IPA [luʃ]). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that \"blossom\" or \"bloom,\" and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and is often referred to as the \"French Method\".\n\nThe \"Bohemian Method\" is a recent invention that involves fire, and was not performed during absinthe's peak of popularity in the Belle Époque. Like the French method, a sugar cube is placed on a slotted spoon over a glass containing one shot of absinthe. The sugar is pre-soaked in alcohol (usually more absinthe), then set ablaze. The flaming sugar cube is then dropped into the glass, thus igniting the absinthe. Finally, a shot glass of water is added to douse the flames. This method tends to produce a stronger drink than the French method. A variant of the Bohemian Method involves allowing the fire to extinguish on its own. This variant is sometimes referred to as \"Cooking the Absinthe\" or \"The Flaming Green Fairy.\" The origin of this burning ritual may borrow from a coffee and brandy drink that was served at Café Brûlot, in which a sugar cube soaked in brandy was set aflame. Most experienced absintheurs do not recommend the Bohemian Method and consider it a modern gimmick, as it can destroy the absinthe flavour and present a fire hazard due to the unusually high alcohol content present in absinthe.\n\nIn 19th century Parisian cafés, upon receiving an order for an absinthe, a waiter would present the patron with a dose of absinthe in a suitable glass, sugar, absinthe spoon, and a carafe of iced water. It was up to the patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar of iced water with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once—and with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass.\n\nAlthough many bars served absinthe in standard glassware, a number of glasses were specifically designed for the French absinthe preparation ritual. Absinthe glasses were typically fashioned with a dose line, bulge, or bubble in the lower portion denoting how much absinthe should be poured. One \"dose\" of absinthe ranged anywhere around 2-2.5 fluid ounces (60-75 ml).\n\nIn addition to being prepared with sugar and water, absinthe emerged as a popular cocktail ingredient in both the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1930, dozens of fancy cocktails that called for absinthe had been published in numerous credible bartender guides. One of the most famous of these libations is Ernest Hemingway's \"Death in the Afternoon\" cocktail, a tongue-in-cheek concoction that contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. The directions are as follows: \"Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.\"\n\nMost categorical alcoholic beverages have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe have always been conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorised into several grades (\"ordinaire\", \"demi-fine\", \"fine\", and \"Suisse\"—the latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as \"distilled\" or \"mixed\", according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as to the quality of its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.\n\n\nAbsinthe that is artificially coloured or clear is aesthetically stable, and can be bottled in clear glass. If naturally coloured absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidised, which has the effect of gradually changing the colour from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as \"feuille morte\" (\"dead leaf\"). In the pre-ban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was coloured naturally, and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that naturally coloured absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a cool (room temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the anethole may polymerise inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.\n\nAbsinthe has been frequently and improperly described in modern times as being hallucinogenic. No peer-reviewed scientific study has demonstrated absinthe to possess hallucinogenic properties. The belief that absinthe induces hallucinogenic effects is at least partly rooted in the fact that following some ten years of experiments with wormwood oil in the 19th century, the French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan studied 250 cases of alcoholism, and claimed that those who drank absinthe were worse off than those drinking ordinary alcohol, having experienced rapid-onset hallucinations. Such accounts by opponents of absinthe (like Magnan) were cheerfully embraced by famous absinthe drinkers, many of whom were bohemian artists or writers.\n\nTwo famous artists who helped popularise the notion that absinthe had powerful psychoactive properties were Toulouse-Lautrec and Vincent van Gogh. In one of the best-known written accounts of absinthe drinking, an inebriated Oscar Wilde described a phantom sensation of having tulips brush against his legs after leaving a bar at closing time.\n\nNotions of absinthe's alleged hallucinogenic properties were again fuelled in the 1970s, when a scientific paper suggested that thujone's structural similarity to THC, the active chemical in cannabis, presented the possibility of THC receptor affinity. This theory was conclusively disproven in 1999.\n\nThe debate over whether absinthe produces effects on the human mind in addition to those of alcohol has not been conclusively resolved. The effects of absinthe have been described by some as mind opening. The most commonly reported experience is a \"clear-headed\" feeling of inebriation—a form of \"lucid drunkenness\". Chemist, historian and absinthe distiller Ted Breaux has claimed that the alleged secondary effects of absinthe may be caused by the fact that some of the herbal compounds in the drink act as stimulants, while others act as sedatives, creating an overall lucid effect of awakening. The long-term effects of moderate absinthe consumption in humans remain unknown, although herbs traditionally used in the production of absinthe are reported to have both painkilling and antiparasitic properties.\n\nToday it is known that absinthe does not cause hallucinations. It is widely accepted that reports of hallucinogenic effects of absinthe were attributable to the poisonous adulterants being added to cheaper versions of the drink in the 19th century, such as oil of wormwood, impure alcohol, and poisonous colouring matter (e.g. copper salts).\n\nIt was once widely promoted that excessive absinthe drinking caused effects that were discernible from those associated with alcoholism, a belief that led to the coining of the term \"absinthism\". One of the first vilifications of absinthe followed an 1864 experiment in which Magnan simultaneously exposed one guinea pig to large doses of pure wormwood vapour, and another to alcohol vapours. The guinea pig exposed to wormwood vapour experienced convulsive seizures, while the animal exposed to alcohol did not. Magnan would later blame the naturally occurring (in wormwood) chemical thujone for these effects.\n\nThujone, once widely believed to be an active chemical in absinthe, is a GABA antagonist, and while it can produce muscle spasms in large doses, there is no direct evidence to suggest it causes hallucinations. Past reports estimated thujone concentrations in absinthe as being up to 260 mg/kg. More recently, published scientific analyses of samples of various original absinthes have disproved previous estimates, and demonstrated that only a trace of the thujone present in wormwood actually makes it into a properly distilled absinthe when historical methods and materials are employed to create the spirit. As such, most traditionally crafted absinthes, both vintage and modern, fall within the current EU standards.\n\nTests conducted on mice to study toxicity showed an oral of about 45 mg thujone per kg of body weight, which represents far more absinthe than could be realistically consumed. The high percentage of alcohol in absinthe would result in mortality long before thujone could become a factor. In documented cases of acute thujone poisoning as a result of oral ingestion, the source of thujone was not commercial absinthe, but rather non-absinthe-related sources, such as common essential oils (which may contain as much as 50% thujone).\n\nOne study published in the \"Journal of Studies on Alcohol\" concluded that high doses (0.28 mg/kg) of thujone in alcohol had negative effects on attention performance in a clinical setting. It delayed reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention into the central field of vision. Low doses (0.028 mg/kg) did not produce an effect noticeably different from the plain alcohol control. While the effects of the high dose samples were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples contained thujone. For the average man, the high dose samples in the study would equate to 18.2 mg of thujone. The EU limit of 35 mg/L of thujone in absinthe means that given the highest permitted thujone content, that individual would need to consume approximately 0.5 litres of high proof (e.g. 50%+ ABV) spirit before the thujone could be metabolized in order to display effects detectable in a clinical setting, which would result in a potentially lethal BAC of >0.4%.\n\nMost countries (except Switzerland) at present do not possess a legal definition of absinthe (unlike Scotch whisky or cognac). Accordingly, producers are free to label a product \"absinthe\" or \"absinth\", whether or not it bears any resemblance to the traditional spirit.\n\nAbsinthe is readily available in many bottle shops. Bitters may contain a maximum 35 mg/kg thujone, while other alcoholic beverages can contain a maximum 10 mg/kg. The domestic production and sale of absinthe is regulated by state licensing laws.\n\nUntil July 13, 2013, the import and sale of absinthe technically required a special permit, since \"oil of wormwood, being an essential oil obtained from plants of the genus \"Artemisia\", and preparations containing oil of wormwood\" were listed as item 12A, Schedule 8, Regulation 5H of the \"Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956\" (Cth). These controls have now been repealed, and permission is no longer required.\n\nAbsinthe was prohibited in Brazil until 1999 and was brought by entrepreneur\nLalo Zanini and legalised in the same year. Presently, absinthe sold in Brazil must abide by the national law that restricts all spirits to a maximum of 54.0% ABV. While this regulation is enforced throughout channels of legal distribution, it may be possible to find absinthe containing alcohol in excess of the legal limit in some restaurants or food fairs.\n\nIn Canada, liquor laws concerning the production, distribution, and sale of spirits are written and enforced by individual provincial government monopolies. Each product is subject to the approval of a respective individual provincial liquor board before it can be sold in that province. Importation is a federal matter, and is enforced by the Canada Border Services Agency. The importation of a nominal amount of liquor by individuals for personal use is permitted, provided that conditions for the individual's duration of stay outside the country are satisfied.\n\n\nIn 2007, Canada's first genuine absinthe (Taboo Absinthe) was created by Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery in British Columbia.\n\nThe European Union permits a maximum thujone level of 35 mg/kg in alcoholic beverages where \"Artemisia\" species is a listed ingredient, and 10 mg/kg in other alcoholic beverages. Member countries regulate absinthe production within this framework. The sale of absinthe is permitted in all EU countries unless they further regulate it.\n\nThe sale and production of absinthe was prohibited in Finland from 1919 to 1932; no current prohibitions exist. The government-owned chain of liquor stores (Alko) is the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing over 5.5% ABV, although national law bans the sale of alcoholic beverages containing over 60% ABV.\n\nDespite adopting sweeping EU food and beverage regulations in 1988 that effectively re-legalised absinthe, a decree was passed that same year that preserved the prohibition on products explicitly labelled as \"absinthe\", while placing strict limits on fenchone (fennel) and pinocamphone (hyssop) in an obvious, but failed, attempt to thwart a possible return of absinthe-like products. French producers circumvented this regulatory obstacle by labelling absinthe as \"spiritueux à base de plantes d'absinthe\" ('wormwood-based spirits'), with many either reducing or omitting fennel and hyssop altogether from their products. A legal challenge to the scientific basis of this decree resulted in its repeal (2009), which opened the door for the official French re-legalisation of absinthe for the first time since 1915. The French Senate voted to repeal the prohibition in mid-April 2011.\n\nIt is legal to produce and sell absinthe in Georgia, which has claimed to possess several producers of absinthe.\n\nA ban on absinthe was enacted in Germany on 27 March 1923. In addition to banning the production of and commercial trade in absinthe, the law went so far as to prohibit the distribution of printed matter that provided details of its production. The original ban was lifted in 1981, but the use of \"Artemisia absinthium\" as a flavouring agent remained prohibited. On 27 September 1991, Germany adopted the European Union's standards of 1988, which effectively re-legalised absinthe.\n\nThe Fascist regime in 1926 banned the production, import, transport and sale of any liquor named \"\"Assenzio\"\". The ban was reinforced in 1931 with harsher penalties for transgressors, and remained in force until 1992 when the Italian government amended its laws to comply with the EU directive 88/388/EEC.\n\nAlthough absinthe is not prohibited at national level, some local authorities have banned it. The latest is Mataura in Southland. The ban came in August 2008 after several issues of misuse drew public and police attention. One incident resulted in breathing difficulties and hospitalisation of a 17-year-old for alcohol poisoning. The particular brand of absinthe that caused these effects was bottled at an unusually high 89.9% ABV.\n\nThe sale and production of absinthe has never been prohibited in Sweden or Norway. However, the only outlet that may sell alcoholic beverages containing more than 3.5% ABV in Sweden and 4.75% ABV in Norway, is the government-owned chain of liquor stores known as Systembolaget in Sweden and Vinmonopolet in Norway. Systembolaget and Vinmonopolet did not import or sell absinthe for many years after the ban in France; however, today several absinthes are available for purchase in Systembolaget stores, including Swedish made distilled absinthe. In Norway, on the other hand, one is less likely to find many absinthes since Norwegian alcohol law prohibits the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages above 60% abv, which eliminates most absinthes.\n\nIn Switzerland, the sale and production of absinthe was prohibited from 1910 to March 1, 2005. This was based on a vote in 1908. To be legally made or sold in Switzerland, absinthe must be distilled, must not contain certain additives, and must be either naturally coloured or left uncoloured.\n\nIn 2014, the Federal Administrative Court of Switzerland invalidated a governmental decision of 2010 which allowed only absinthe made in the Val-de-Travers region to be labeled as absinthe in Switzerland. The court found that absinthe was a label for a product and was not tied to a geographic origin.\n\nIn 2007, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) effectively lifted the long-standing absinthe ban, and it has since approved many brands for sale in the US market. This was made possible partly through the TTB's clarification of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) thujone content regulations, which specify that finished food and beverages that contain \"Artemisia\" species must be thujone-free. In this context, the TTB considers a product thujone-free if the thujone content is less than 10 ppm (equal to 10 mg/kg). This is verified through the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The brands Kübler and Lucid and their lawyers did most of the work to get absinthe legalized in the U.S., over the 2004-2007 time period. In the U.S., March 5 sometimes is referred to as \"National Absinthe Day\" as it was the day the 95-year ban on absinthe was finally lifted.\n\nThe import, distribution, and sale of absinthe is permitted subject to the following restrictions:\n\n\nAbsinthe imported in violation of these regulations is subject to seizure at the discretion of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBeginning in 2000, a product called Absente was sold legally in the United States under the marketing tagline \"Absinthe Refined,\" but as the product contained sugar, and was made with \"southernwood\" (\"Artemisia abrotanum\") and not grande wormwood (\"Artemisia absinthium\") (prior to 2009), the TTB classified it as a liqueur.\n\nThe Absinthe (Prohibition) Act 1915, passed in the New Hebrides, has never been repealed, is included in the 2006 Vanuatu consolidated legislation, and contains the following all-encompassing restriction: \"The manufacture, importation, circulation and sale wholesale or by retail of absinthe or similar liquors in Vanuatu shall be prohibited.\"\n\nNumerous artists and writers living in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were noted absinthe drinkers, and featured absinthe in their work. Some of these included Édouard Manet, Guy de Maupassant, Amedeo Modigliani, Arthur Rimbaud, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Verlaine, Vincent van Gogh, Oscar Wilde, and Émile Zola. Many other renowned artists and writers similarly drew from this cultural well, including Aleister Crowley, Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso, August Strindberg and Erik Satie. \n\nThe aura of illicitness and mystery surrounding absinthe has played into literature, movies, music, and television, where it is often portrayed as a mysterious, addictive, and mind-altering drink. Absinthe has served as the subject of numerous works of fine art, films, video, music, and literature since the mid-19th-century. Some of the earliest film references include \"The Hasher's Delirium\" (1910) by Émile Cohl, an early pioneer in the art of animation, as well as two different silent films, each entitled \"Absinthe\", from 1913 and 1914 respectively.\n\nOn November 9, 2018, the alternative rock band I Don't Know How But They Found Me released a song titled \"Absinthe\" as part of their 1981 Extended Play.\n\n\n\n"}

It is part of a wider South-East Asian tradition of tribal jewelry, as \"\"gantung\"\" (meaning \"\"hanging\"\") in Indonesian/Malay and \"\"anting-anting\"\" (meaning \"ear pendant\") in Javanese.\n\nIn the Philippine occult tradition, there is usually a corresponding \"agimat\" to deal with in a particular area in a person's life. The most frequent types of \"agimat\" are used for removing hexes and exorcism of evil spirits. An \"agimat\" also called a \"gayuma\" serves as a love charm which makes the owner more attractive to the opposite sex. Although stereotyped as a cross, a flat, round or triangular golden pendant accompanying a necklace or a necklace-like item, it is also depicted as an enchanted stone that came from the sky or a fang left by a lightning strike (\"pangil ng kidlat\") or even a drop of liquid from the heart of a banana tree at midnight (\"mutya\"). In relation to the latter, it is usually ingested. An \"agimat\" is usually accompanied by a small book of magic incantations which must be read during Good Friday or a certain special date to attain the amulet's full power and benefit. An \"agimat\" could also be in the form of a clothing with magic words inscribed on it, or even in the form of edible enchanted mud (\"putik\" in Tagalog).\n\nOther methods of obtaining an \"agimat\" is by getting the liquid that is drained from an exhumed body of an unbaptized child or aborted fetus or offering food and drinks to the spirits in a cemetery during midnight of Holy Wednesday or Holy Thursday. Most of the amulets bear Latin inscriptions into it. Like those in Quiapo district in Manila, most of the \"agimat\" merchants are near churches (like in its courtyard or in the marketplace just nearby). Filipino freedom fighters also wore \"anting-anting\" to battle against the Spaniards and the Americans. Filipino hero Macario Sakay wore a vest that has religious images and Latin phrases to protect him from bullets. Former Philippine-President Ferdinand Marcos, was given an \"anting-anting\" by Gregorio Aglipay that could supposedly make Marcos invisible. Marcos said that the \"agimat\" is a sliver of wood that was inserted into his back before the Bataan campaign on 1942.\n\nEarliest reports of \"anting-anting\" are from the records of Spanish priests in the early colonial period. Pardo de Tavera defines the \"anting-anting\" as \"an amulet, of super natural power, that saves lives.\" With the Christianization of the Philippines, \"anting-anting\" appropriated the forms of the new religion, and incorporated as well the esoteric symbolisms of Freemasonry. An Islamic version of \"anting-anting\" exists in the Southern Muslim islands. In Filipino films, the wearer of the \"agimat\" gains superhuman strength, invisibility, heightened senses, self-healing, and elemental powers. With it, the person can also be able to shoot or fire lightning via hands, or generate electricity throughout one's body. The person can also perform telekinesis, stop a live bullet, can have premonitions, invisibility, flight, morphing abilities, camouflage abilities like a chameleon, can have extreme good luck, possess invincibility, or perform miracle curative powers. In his Filipino films, actor Ramon Revilla, Sr., as \"Nardong Putik\", was depicted to have protection from bullets and slash wounds, provided he eats a certain special mud.\n"}

Lucid is distilled entirely from spirits and European whole herbs and uses no artificial additives, oils, or dyes.\n\nAllegedly created as an elixir in the 1790s by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire of Switzerland, absinthe became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the 5 p.m. happy hour was called l'heure verte (\"the green hour\"). By 1910, the French were drinking 36 million liters of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5 billion liters of wine. As a result, the winemakers association, among other groups, began a campaign of misinformation that tied consuming absinthe to claims of insanity, criminal activity and hallucinations – all designed to discourage consumption. These claims were aided by the fact that unlike Cognac, champagne, etc., there was no law that defined absinthe – nothing to regulate the production and quality. In 1912, the U.S. Department of Agriculture banned absinthe in the United States, and it was banned in France a few years later.\n\nAfter 95 years of prohibition, genuine absinthe was re-authorized for sale in the United States with the approval of Lucid in 2007. Lucid creator and scientist T.A. Breaux negotiated with the U.S. government on the basis that Lucid was created from absinthe-making techniques used over a century ago. The result was not only a genuine, historically accurate product, but one that met all requirements of the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau that any finished food or beverage tests less than 10ppm or 10 mg/kg for Thujone pursuant to 21 CFR 172.510, and well under the 35 mg/kg content that is legal within the European Union. The Lucid brand revived the antique term \"Absinthe Supérieure\" to differentiate itself from the negative connotations of absinthe that persisted in the TTB.\n\nLucid was granted a COLA (Certificate of Label Approval) in the United States on March 5, 2007,\nmaking it the first genuine absinthe to gain approval for legal distribution in the U.S. since 1912.\n\nLucid was produced for Viridian Spirits, LLC, New York before being sold to Hood River Distillers in 2013.\n\nLucid is distilled entirely from all natural ingredients and is the first genuine absinthe distilled with real Grande Wormwood (\"Artemisia absinthium\") available in the United States in more than 95 years. Lucid is made with historically accurate volumes of Grande Wormwood, as well as other botanicals, such as green anise and sweet fennel that are traditional to the spirit. The recipe was developed by T.A. Breaux, an absinthe expert and historian. Lucid’s green color is derived directly from the botanicals, without any artificial coloring added – a key feature of genuine absinthe. Lucid’s natural color requires a dark bottle because exposure to light will cause the natural color to fade, which explains why so many traditional absinthes were bottled in dark glass.\n\nLucid is characterized by upfront flavors of anise and fennel, followed by mild mid-palate earthy textures attributable to the absinthe (Artemisia absinthium). The herbs round out the flavor with additional spice and grassy notes, which linger in a moderately long finish.\n\nLucid is 124 proof or 62% alcohol/volume.\n\n"}

It is cooked on a griddle, \"backstone\" or \"baxton\". The oatcake is a local speciality in the North Staffordshire area of England, specifically Stoke-on-Trent. They are normally referred to as \"Staffordshire oatcakes\" by non-locals, because they were made in and around Staffordshire and Cheshire; locally they are simply called \"oatcakes\".\n\nIt was once common throughout the Potteries for oatcakes to be sold directly from the window of a house to customers on the street. The last producer in this style, the \"Hole in the Wall\" in Stoke-on-Trent, closed on 25 March 2012; however, there are many small commercial premises who sell oatcakes, either ready to eat, with a filling, or in batches of half a dozen or a dozen for the customer to take home. Larger commercial enterprises exist that sell oatcakes to supermarkets and other large distribution chains.\n\nOatcakes can be a form of fast food. Catering outlets in the area usually offer oatcakes with fillings such as cheese, tomato, onion, bacon, sausage, and egg. They can also be eaten with sweet fillings such as golden syrup, jam or banana, but this is less common and frowned upon by traditionalists. They are traditionally re-heated by steaming between two plates over a saucepan of water or nowadays by microwave, though some may prefer frying in butter or grilling.\n\nThe Staffordshire oatcake is not to be confused with the Scottish oatcake (biscuit); although both are made from oatmeal, the two types of oatcakes are very different. The Staffordshire oatcake dates back to the 19th century where it was baked on a hotplate over an open fire.\n\nDerbyshire oatcakes are similar to Staffordshire oatcakes, but while following a similar (or even the same) recipe are generally larger in diameter, and thicker. For example, the same recipe will make four Derbyshire or twelve Staffordshire oatcakes.\n\nA Lancashire oatcake bears a passing resemblance to a Derbyshire oatcake, but is made without wheat flour or milk, and shaped as an approximate oval, smooth on one side and rough on the other, and traditionally cooked on a bakestone. It may be eaten moist, rolled up like a pancake with a filling, or dried hung over a rack until a crisp cracker. The dried version served with a beef and cowheel stew is known as \"stew and hard\". Once common throughout Lancashire, it is now rarely found. The same cake is also cooked in West Yorkshire and Craven, and is thus sometimes referred to as the Pennine oatcake, although in Yorkshire the recipe often incorporated approximately 20% buttermilk.\n\nIn Lancashire and Yorkshire, oatcake was a staple of the diet up to around 1910 Up to the 18th century, oatcakes were often called \"havercakes\", from \"hafr\", the Old Germanic word for oats, but that name only continued to be used in the North Riding of Yorkshire and Teesside for a different kind of oatcake that is thick with no yeast. The word is perpetuated in the nickname \"The Havercake Lads\" for the 33rd Regiment of Foot and also in the term haversack.\n\nIn Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire the griddle was called a bakstone. Originally a bakstone was a portable flat oval flaggy sandstone approximately thick, set on an open fire. In the 19th century these were replaced with a cast-iron plate with a hooped handle, yet the name remained unchanged. In large houses they were built in next to the chimney, with a firebox under an iron plate that was approximately by , or in larger houses a pair of square plates.\n\nIn the 18th century the batter was mixed in a small wooden bucket which was not cleaned, so that the particles on the sides acted as a fermenting agent for the next baking. In the 19th century, the use of baker's yeast and porcelain containers or enamel pails became standard.\n\nThe size of the ladle varied relative to the current cost of oatmeal; for many decades, oatcakes were by tradition one penny each, or 18 for a shilling.\n\nBefore ca. 1860, the method was called \"thrown oatcakes\" or \"riddlebread\". The baker sifted oatmeal onto the \"riddleboard\", poured on a ladleful of batter, and then, with a circular horizontal movement, spread and leveled the batter. It was then slid onto a piece of linen covering the \"spittle\" board, a board with a handle. The cake was thereby \"thrown\" (flipped) on to the bakstone and then the linen taken up.\n\nBaking racks were contrived by turning a chair on its side and covering the legs with a white cloth.\n\nOatcakes made for drying were left until crisp on a fixture called the bread flake. Flake, pronounced \"fleeak\", is from the Old Norse \"fleki\" meaning a hurdle. Flakes in Wharfedale had wooden laths; one at Ling House measured by with 23 cross bars. Those in upper Ribblesdale had strings, over two of which each cake was laid. In some areas the rack was called a bread creel.\n\nStoke-on-Trent held an Oatcake Day event on Sunday, 8 August 2010. This led to other associated events such as \"Oatcake Camp\". \n\n\n"}

It is an important representation of Haitian culture and history.\n\nMany artists cluster in ‘schools’ of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.\n\nThe Centre d’Art d'Haïti, also known as \"Naïve Art\" or \"peinture naïve\", was an art movement founded in 1944 by a group of artists which include: Maurice Borno, Andrée Malebranche, Albert Mangonès, Lucien Price, and Georges Remponeau. Popular artists of this movement often were influenced by vaudou and include: André Pierre, Hector Hippolyte, Castera Bazile, Wilson Bigaud and Rigaud Benoit.\n\nCentre d’Art d'Haïti type of artwork is often characterized by vivid colors, spatial composition and spontaneity of painting. \n\nSaint Soleil School, also known as \"Movement Saint-Soleil\" was founded in 1973 as a rural arts community called Soisson-la-Montagne, in Pétion-Ville, Haiti. This community was started by Jean-Claude Garoute and Maud Robart and they encouraged the academic study of painting, as well as maintaining influence by vaudou. Saint Soleil art is characterized by abstract human forms and the heavy influence of vaudou symbolism.\n\nAfter Saint Soleil School disbanded, five remaining members of the school were renamed \"Cinq Soleil\" and include: Levoy Exil, Prosper Pierre Louis, Louisiane Saint Fleurant, Dieuseul Paul, Denis Smith.\n\nA second generation member is Magda Magloire, the daughter of Louisiane Saint Fleurant.\n\nThe painters of the Artibonite department in north-western Haiti, where Hôpital Albert Schweitzer is located, have developed their own style, which is quite recognizable.\n\nThe style began with Saincilus Ismaël (1940–2000), who was influenced by Byzantine art he had seen in books. Ismaël began to paint in 1956 after visiting the Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince. His paintings are marked by exquisite detail. Every article of clothing, house, or tree is painted with a different intricate geometric pattern.\n\nDélouis Jean-Louis grew up in Petite Rivière under the influence of Ismaël. Although he worked under Ismaël for 15 years, he never had formal painting lessons. He began painting to make money, but gradually began to paint carefully executed scenes from his imagination.\n\nAlix Dorléus also learned to paint with Ismaël and Mrs. Mellon. He paints all day long and will paint anywhere he feels the spirit to motivate him. His best paintings are detailed depictions, like activity maps, of daily life in the Artibonite Valley.\n\nErnst Louizor is considered one of the best impressionist painters of Haiti. Louzor was born in Port-au-Prince on October 16, 1938. After high school (Lycee Toussaint L'Ouverture '57) he worked in the tax section of Customs. Louizor's painting career began in 1951 when at the age of 13 he joined the Centre d'Art and studied under Wilmino Domond. He later entered the Académie des Beaux-Arts shortly after its founding in 1959 and furthered his studies with Georges Remponeau. Louzor has many disciples including his wife Gerda Louizor. He has exhibited in Europe and the U.S..\n\nNotable artists of Haitian descent and members of the diaspora include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Hersza Barjon and Ernst Registre.\n\nThe market painting is a Haitian archetype, originating with Laurent Casimir. It typically depicts a Haitian market and is done in the trademark colors of Casimir red, yellow and orange. The motive is often dense with people. These paintings were mass-produced by Laurent Casimir and his apprentices in the mid-1970s, all signed by Casimir. This archetype is later taken up by contemporary Haitian artist like Jean-Louis, many of which studied under Laurent Casimir.\n\nThere is evidence that sculpture from the Tainos in Haiti existed in the Pre-Columbian era and they would create dolls, drawings, signs. It's speculated by researchers that these sculptures may have been representing their deities (maybe the ancestors of the vèvè in vaudou).\n\nContemporary Haitian sculpture is made of natural materials, traditional art mediums, and recycled materials.\n\n\"Haitian Steel Drum Sculpture\" – The village of Noailles in Croix-des-Bouquets is home to over a dozen artisan workshops producing countless pieces for over two decades. The work is created out of recycled oil drums. In August 2011, the Clinton Global Initiative along with Greif Inc., donated 40 tons of scrap metal to the artists in Croix-des-Bouquets. After the earthquake in 2010, artists had a difficult time finding material to work from. According to Deputy Jean Tholbert Alexis, 8,000 people in the area are directly or indirectly benefit from the villages' artisans.\n\nThe tradition of making flags (\"drapo servis\") to decorate Vodou places of worship is a distinctive form of Haitian Vodou art. Flags most often commemorate specific spirits or saints, but the 2010 earthquake has become a common subject of art flags. The use of sequins in these flags became prevalent in the 1940s, and many of today's flags cover the entire flag in colored sequins and beads. These flags are traded as art by dealers around the world.\n\nOn January 12, 2010 a devastating earthquake struck Port-au-Prince and the its surrounding area and resulted in mass devastation. The Haitian art world suffered great losses in the earthquake. Museums and art galleries were extensively damaged, among them Port-au-Prince's main art museum, Centre d'Art, where many art works were destroyed. The collection at Collège Saint Pierre also was devastated, as was the collection of priceless murals in the Holy Trinity Cathedral. Some private art galleries were also severely damaged, including the Monnin Gallery in Pétion-Ville, and the Nader Art Gallery and Musée Nader in Port-au-Prince. The personal collection of Georges Nader Sr., the Nader collection was worth an estimated US$30-US$100 million. Shortly after the earthquake struck, UNESCO assigned special envoy Bernard Hadjadj to evaluate damage to artwork. The Smithsonian Institution, led by Under Secretary Richard Kurin, and with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and the Government of Haiti among others, embarked on a multiyear project and survey to help restore key Haitian cultural treasures and train local Haitians on art preservation and recovery techniques. \n\nHaitian Art Society\nHaitian Art\nhttps://study.com/academy/lesson/haitian-art-history-style-facts.html \n\nhttps://www.iowasource.com/2017/10/25/haitian-art-convergence-the-stories-of-haiti-told-in-unbridled-color/\n\nMuseum Collections\n\nGalleries in Haiti\n\nGalleries in the United States\n\nFilms\n\nWebsites\n"}

These ingredients are usually blended together and cooked in vegetable or corn oil for a little over an hour to create the sauce. The blend of spices and fish differs between different regions and villages but owes its original recipe to the Ga tribe.\n\nIn Ghana, shito is used with a variety of dishes. These include kenkey, steamed rice, eba and \"waakye\" (rice and beans). Indeed, its uses have been adapted to that of a local ketchup, hot sauce or chili oil.

Ghagghe Khudabuksh (1790-1880 AD) introduced the \"Khayal\" style of Gwalior Gharana into Agra gharana which Khudabaksh learnt from Natthan Paribaksh of Gwalior. \n\nThe gayaki of the Agra Gharana is a blend of khayal gayaki and dhrupad-dhamar. In training, both the khayal and dhrupad components run hand in hand and are not taught in an isolated fashion. This is obvious from the method of singing notes of the Agra Gharana which demands that the projection of voice be more forceful and voluminous than usually encountered in khayal gayaki, as well as uttering notes open and bare (without grace notes).\n\nMost khayal performances by artists of Agra gharana commence with the nom-tom alaap, a tradition unique to the Agra gharana. Different facets of a raga are displayed with the help of bandish while the raga is elaborated using vistaar.\n\nThe gharana adopts a kind of voice production which relies on a flatter version of the vowel sound \"a\", which makes its music agreeable to rhythmic variations and is best suited for a deep masculine voice. Emphasis is laid on bold, full-throated and robust voice production, and singing in the lower register (mandra) is favoured. Keeping in tune with its dhrupadic origins, the singers use broad and powerful ornamentations (gamaks), extensive glides (meends), and resonant articulations of notes. As with the Gwalior gharana, the Agra singers accentuate the importance of the bandish and its methodical exposition. Singers following Faiyaz Khan's style resort to the dhrupadic nom-tom alaap before singing the bandish. The singers of this gharana are also great masters over layakari or the rhythmic component. In fact, layakari is the foundation on which the singers build the edifice of the bandish. Agra singers' tihais are eagerly awaited, as are their nifty ways of arriving at the same, by building up anticipation within the listener.\n\nThis is the only Gharana that has still continued to sing Dhrupad-Dhamar along with Nom-Tom Alap, Khayal, Thumri, Tappa, Tarana, Hori, \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11984527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11984527", "title": "Pempek", "text": "Pempek\n\nPempek, mpek-mpek or empek-empek is a savoury Southeast Asian fishcake delicacy, made of fish and tapioca, from Palembang, South Sumatera, Indonesia. Pempek is served with rich sweet and sour sauce called \"kuah cuka\" or \"kuah cuko\" (lit. vinegar sauce), or just \"cuko\". Sometimes local people also eat the dish with yellow noodles and diced up cucumber to balance out the vinegar's sourness.\n\nPempek is the best-known of Palembang's dishes. Its origin is undoubtedly Palembang. However, the history behind the creation of this savoury dish is unclear. Traditional folklore connects it with Chinese influences. However, latest study suggests that pempek probably originated from ancient \"kelesan\", a steamed dish made of the mixture of sago dough with fish flesh, dated as early as Srivijayan era circa 7th century. Sago flour might be extracted from the trunk of sago palm or aren palm.\n\nAccording to local tradition, around the 16th century there was an old Chinese immigrant who lived near the Musi river. He noticed an abundance of fish caught by the local fishermen. In the Sumatran tropical climate, before the invention of refrigeration technology, most of these unsold leftover fish decayed and were wasted. The indigenous people, however had limited knowledge and techniques for processing fish. During that period, most of the indigenous people simply grilled, fried or boiled their fish instead of adding other ingredients to make new dishes. The old Chinese man mixed in some tapioca and other spices, which he then sold around the village on his cart. The people referred to this old man as 'pek-apek, where \"apek\" is a Chinese slang word to call an old man. The food is known today as empek-empek or pempek.\n\nAnother theory suggests that pempek was a Palembang adaptation of Southern Chinese ngo hiang or kekkian (fish slice) as a surimi (魚漿, yújiāng) based food. But instead of being served in soup or plainly fried, pempek is notable for its spicy palm sugar-vinegar based sauce.\n\nPempek dough is made from a mixture of boneless ground fish meat, most commonly \"tenggiri\" (wahoo), with water, salt and sago flour. People sometimes add a little bit of cooking oil and/or wheat flour to improve texture and not to make the pempek too chewy and to add MSG to enrich the umami taste. \"Ikan gabus\" (snakehead) is also commonly made as pempek. Numerous pempek sellers and producers in Palembang use a cheap combination of fish, which has a strong scent. According to tradition, the best tasting pempek are made of \"belida\" or \"belido\" (\"Chitala lopis\"), but due to its rarity and superior taste, pempek made from this fish are usually more expensive. Pempek in Bangka Island are made from mackerel (\"ikan kembung\") and its sauce is red chilli based, while in Jakarta or other cities they could be made from \"gourami\" fish. The latest variant is \"pempek udang\", pempek made of minced shrimp originated from Sungsang area in Banyuasin near the Musi river estuary, it is noticeable with its pinkish color.\n\nThe dough is boiled in hot water or steamed until hardened as partly cooked dumplings, and stored to be fried later just before serving.\n\n\"Kuah cuko\" is produced by adding palm sugar, chili pepper, garlic, vinegar, and salt to boiling water. The color of this sauce is dark brown. Sometimes Tongcai and Ebi (ground dried shrimp) are also added to increase the flavor. This sweet, sour and spicy sauce is essential for flavouring the pempek, since the pempek dough is very mildly savoury. The sauce of Bangka pempek is chili based, made from the mixture of ground red chili and vinegar and its color is bright red. Traditionally all pempek sauces are served hot and spicy, the ground chilies are mixed in the sauce. However, since some people desire unspicy sauce, or cannot eat hot and spicy sauce, the ground chillis were often separated as sambals. In some pempek restaurants, the bottled kuah cuko sauce is left on customers' tables and they are welcome to pour on the amount of sauce they desire. There are two kind of sauces available, spicy hot and plain.\n\nThe boiled or steamed pempek dumplings are deep-fried in cooking oil until light pale brown right before serving. They are cut in bite-size, served with yellow noodles or rice vermicelli, showered in \"kuah cuko\", and sprinkled with chopped cucumber and ebi powder. The additional fish krupuk crackers might be offered.\n\nThis fishcake dough can be made into various shapes and forms with additional ingredients. Just like pasta the shapes have their own distinctive names, although all are made from the same dough. There are many varieties of pempek, pempek variants are:\n\n\nMost of those pempek in various forms are deep fried in cooking oil until light pale brown, and served with yellow noodles or rice vermicelli and \"kuah cuko\", sprinkled with chopped cucumber and ebi powder.\n\nThe pempek fishcake can be used as a base ingredient of other dishes. The unfried cylindrical pempek lenjer is often cut and added as a mixture to the following dishes:\n\nAs a local specialty, pempek can be commonly found on every street in Palembang with a concentration of outlets in downtown Palembang. Pempek can also be found in other regions, especially in major cities in Indonesia. However, the taste of pempek in other regions are usually different to pempek from Palembang. The main ingredients such as fish and flour are scarce and/or difficult to find in other regions, causing the difference in taste.\n\nPempek is easy to find in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities, from the food-courts in malls and shopping centers to traveling pempek vendors on cart. The cheaper pempek version sold by traveling vendors on cart generally use less fish and more tapioca, resulting a more flavorless taste. Pempek is also a popular dish in South Sumatra's neighboring province capital city Bandar Lampung. Some pempek establishments, such as Pempek Pak Raden and Pempek Bunga Mas are opening branches all over major foodcourts. In Jakarta, the notable pempek outlets are Pempek Megaria in Metropole cinema complex, Central Jakarta. It is among the oldest pempek establishment in the city. Other pempek outlets are those in Pasar Minggu market, South Jakarta. In Yogyakarta one of leading pempek establishment in the city is Pempek Ny. Kamto located near Malioboro street.\n\nOutside Indonesia, pempek establishments can be found in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia. As Palembang is located quite not far from Singapore and Malaysia, to ensure the authenticity, some pempek establishments import boiled unfried frozen pempek dumplings in vacuum packages straight from Palembang. These ready to cook pempek dumplings are also popularly sold in Palembang as \"oleh-oleh\" foodstuff gifts or souvenirs for visitors from other Indonesian cities.\n\n\n"}

It is considered a specialty in the city of Los Baños, Laguna located on the island of Luzon.\n\nPopular with Filipinos, it resembles a coconut cream pie, except that it is made with young coconuts (\"buko\" in Tagalog) and has neither cream in the coconut custard filling or meringue swirls on top of the baked coconut custard. Instead, the pie uses sweetened condensed milk, making it denser and healthier. The pie is made with \"buko\" meat. There are also variations of the pie, which are similar but use slightly different ingredients, such as \"macapuno pie\", that uses a special type of coconut which differs from ordinary coconut as it is thick and sticky.\nThe pie was originally a delicacy only available in the Philippines, but blast freezing technology has allowed buko pie-makers the ability to export. As it has become easier to transport and more accessible around the world, people are able to buy it as a \"pasalubong\" or homecoming present after having visited the Philippines. Buko pie is traditionally plain, nowadays flavorings such as pandan, vanilla, or almond essences are used. \nBuko pie is similar to the Dutch-Indonesian \"klappertaart\" and the South African \"klappertert\". \"Klappertaart\" differs from the Filipino buko pie as it is a baked creamy coconut custard without the crust, and contains raisins and nuts. \"Klappertert\" is most akin to the Filipino buko pie as it also has a crust, but differs in that it also adds apricot jam and a dash of cinnamon to the coconut custard.\n\nThe idea of the buko pie is said to have originated from the province of Laguna in the Philippines. The creators of this Filipino pastry were the Pahud sisters who were locals of the city of Los Baños, Laguna. Soledad Pahud returned to her family in the Philippines after she worked as a maid in the United States. While she was working abroad, she learned to make apple pies. In the process of starting up a bakeshop business, Pahud tried to recreate the American dessert with the help of her sisters. As apples were not native to the Philippines, Pahud along with her family improvised and replaced the ingredient with \"buko\" or young coconuts. Using \"buko\" as the ingredient for the pie filling was recommended by one of the sisters named Apolonia because of the resource's abundance locally. The Pahud sisters' bakeshop business grew into what is now Orient Buko Pie Bakeshop, their own bakery specializing in buko pies. The sisters also created their own variations of the buko pie which include apple buko pie, pineapple pie, and tropical pie.\n\nBuko pie is very high in calories and rich in fat, carbohydrates and proteins according to its nutritional value. It is a source of calcium, iron, niacin and folate. As a result of the use of white sugar and condensed milk in the pastry, excess calories are found.\n\nWhile the pastry contains 66.9g of carbohydrates, the level of simple carbohydrates within a buko pie is higher than the level of complex carbohydrates. The dish serves as a source of a healthy yield of iron. Buko pie also contains a high amount of sugar and magnesium, and an average amount of sodium.\n\nA buko pie recipe generally contains the following ingredients:\n\n\n\nWhen making buko pie a double baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling need to be prepared separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked and set aside to cool. Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is lightly browned.\n\n"}

The analogous annual phenomenon is seasonal lag.\n\nAs solar energy strikes the earth’s surface each morning, a shallow layer of air directly above the ground is heated by conduction. Heat exchange between this shallow layer of warm air and the cooler air above is very inefficient. On a warm summer’s day, for example, air temperatures may vary by from just above the ground to waist height. Incoming solar radiation exceeds outgoing heat energy for many hours after noon and equilibrium is usually reached from 3–5 p.m. but this may be affected by a variety of different things such as large bodies of water, soil type and cover, wind, cloud cover/water vapor, and moisture on the ground.\n\nDiurnal temperature variations are greatest very near Earth's surface.\n\nHigh desert regions typically have the greatest diurnal-temperature variations, while low-lying humid areas typically have the least. This explains why an area like the Snake River Plain can have high temperatures of during a summer day, and then have lows of . At the same time, Washington D.C., which is much more humid, has temperature variations of only ; urban Hong Kong has a diurnal temperature range of little more than . \n\nWhile the National Park Service claimed that the world single-day record is a variation of (from to ) in Browning, Montana in 1916, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality claimed that Loma, Montana also had a variation of (from to ) in 1972.\n\nDiurnal temperature variation is of particular importance in viticulture. Wine regions situated in areas of high altitude experience the most dramatic swing in temperature variation during the course of a day. In grapes, this variation has the effect of producing high acid and high sugar content as the grapes' exposure to sunlight increases the ripening qualities while the sudden drop in temperature at night preserves the balance of natural acids in the grape.\n\n"}

In 2001, Vikingfjord Vodka was relaunched in the USA, this time more successfully.\n\nVikingfjord Vodka has since won several prizes in international wine and spirits competitions and is a bestseller in Norway.

{"id": "12068253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12068253", "title": "Blue Hawaii (drink)", "text": "Blue Hawaii (drink)\n\nThe Blue Hawaii is a tropical cocktail made of rum, pineapple juice, Blue Curaçao, sweet and sour mix, and sometimes vodka. It should not be confused with the similarly named Blue Hawaiian cocktail (also known as the Swimming Pool cocktail) that contains creme of coconut instead of sweet and sour mix.\n\nThe Blue Hawaii was invented in 1957 by Harry Yee, legendary head bartender of the Hilton Hawaiian Village (formerly the Kaiser Hawaiian Village) in Waikiki, Hawaii when a sales representative of Dutch distiller Bols asked him to design a drink that featured their blue color of Curaçao liqueur. After experimenting with several variations he settled on a version somewhat different from the most popular version today, but with the signature blue color, pineapple wedge, and cocktail umbrella.\n\nThe name \"Blue Hawaii\" is related only indirectly to the 1961 Elvis Presley film of the same name, and apparently derives instead from the film's title song, a hit composed by Leo Robin for the 1937 Bing Crosby film \"Waikiki Wedding\". It was Yee who named the drink which, along with the films and songs, many other tropical drinks he invented, and tiki bars such as Trader Vic, did much to popularize a faux Hawaiian tiki culture, both in Hawaii itself and on the Mainland. The era was immediately pre-statehood, a time when Hawaii was thought of by most Americans as playground for the rich. Tourism and development was already significant, but all centered on Waikiki and at only a small fraction of today's levels – about 100,000 visitors per year then, compared to seven million today.\n\nA Blue Hawaii is typically served on the rocks. As with most tropical drinks, there are many variations in preparation, presentation, and ingredients. Hence, it is often blended with ice, margarita-like, to be served as a frozen cocktail. Many variations of glassware are used, the more whimsical the better: tiki mugs, cocktail glasses, parfait glasses, or carved out coconuts or pineapples.\n\nThe base liquor is usually light rum but vodka may be partially or completely substituted as a matter of taste. Similarly, a flavored rum or vodka such as Malibu Rum may eliminate the need for crème of coconut, or the coconut flavor may be omitted entirely (coconut milk, a very different product, should \"not\" be used). Even the pineapple juice is sometimes left out in favor of sour mix. The only constant, in fact, is the name and the blue Curaçao.\n\nBecause it is easy and inexpensive to make, it is often served as a punch. At its simplest, it is a bottle or two of plain or coconut-flavored light rum, a bottle of blue curacao, a can of pineapple juice, and a bag of ice, mixed together in a punchbowl. The Blue Hawaii is seasonal, often considered a summer or warm weather drink. Occasionally, because it contains yellow pineapple juice, the Blue Hawaii will have a green coloration instead.\n\n"}

Fish prepared as \"daing\" are usually split open (though they may be left whole), gutted, salted liberally, and then sun and air-dried. There are also \"boneless\" variants which fillets the fish before the drying process. It was originally a preservation technique, as salt inhibits the growth of bacteria, allowing fish to be stored for long periods of time.\nA variant of \"daing\" known as labtingaw uses less salt and is dried for a much shorter period (only a few hours). The resulting \"daing\" is still slightly moist and meatier than the fully dried variant. Yet another variant of \"daing\" known as lamayo, does away with the drying process altogether. Instead, after the fish is cleaned, it is simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and other spices before frying. \n\n\"Daing\" is considered poverty food due to its relative cheapness. But it has gained significance in Philippine culture as comfort food. One of the most popular comfort food \"daing\" is \"danggit\" or \"dangguit.\" Danggit, dried rabbitfish, is usually simply fried before consumption and served with rice and a dip (usually vinegar or calamansi). As breakfast food, they may be served with fried eggs. \n\nIn Central and Southern Philippines, \"daing\" is known as \"bulad\" or \"buwad\" in Cebuano. The variants which use sliced and gutted fish are known as \"pinikas\" (literally \"halved\" referring to the halves of the fish). Northern regions usually do not distinguish between the two, though some may use \"daing\" to refer exclusively to the halved and gutted variants, while \"tuyô\" is used for all variants. \n\nVirtually any fish can be prepared as \"daing\". The species of fish used is usually identified by name when sold in markets. For example, in Cebu, the local specialty which uses rabbitfish (\"Siganus\" spp., locally known as \"danggit\"), is called \"buwad danggit\". Other fish species used include threadfin breams (Nemipteridae, locally known as \"bisugo\"); grey mullets (Mugilidae, locally known as \"banak\"); and sardines (\"Sardinella\" spp. and \"Dussumieria acuta\", locally known as \"tunsoy\" or \"tamban\"). \"Daing\" made from sardines are usually dried whole, though exported variants may be gutted to comply with food laws in other countries.

Vegetarian salteñas are sometimes available at certain restaurants.\n\nTypically salteñas can be found in any town or city throughout the country, but each area has its variations; Cochabamba and Sucre claim to have the best version of this snack, and many will go out of their way to try the variation from Potosí. In La Paz, it is a tradition to enjoy salteñas as a mid-morning snack, although vendors often start selling salteñas very early in the morning. The pastries are sold anywhere from 7am to noon; most vendors sell out by mid-morning.\n\nHistorian Antonio Paredes Candia states that during the early 19th century, Juana Manuela Gorriti was the first person to create the current version of this product. This lady later married Presidente Manuel Isidoro Belzu. Gorriti was born in Salta, Argentina and was exiled to Potosí, Bolivia during the Juan Manuel de Rosas dictatorship. The Gorriti family endured extreme poverty, and they came up with the recipe in the early 19th century in order to make a living. A variation of these pastries was known at the time throughout most of Europe.\n\nThe product, nicknamed \"salteña\", became very popular. Candia states that it was common to say to kids: \"\"Ve y recoge una empanada de la salteña\"\" (\"go and pick up an empanada from the woman from Salta\"). In time most forgot the name Manuela Gorriti, but not the nickname. Eventually the salteñas left the Potosí and became a Bolivian tradition.\n\nSalteñas are juicy, like a stew in a pastry. The juiciness is achieved by making a stew out of all the ingredients and adding gelatin, so that the stew hardens in the refrigerator, and then slowly melts when they are baked. This ensures that the dough does not get soggy even while providing a very juicy filling. They are more football-shaped than flat like empanadas. The trick to eating them is to hold them upright, nibble the top corner and work your way down without spilling any of the hot juices. Llajua (Bolivian salsa) complements it well.\n\n"}

In South Korea, fried chicken is consumed as a meal, an appetizer, anju (food that is served and eaten with drinks), or as an after-meal snack.\n\nKorean fried chicken differs from typical American fried chicken because it is fried twice; the skin is therefore crunchier and less greasy. Furthermore, Korean-style chicken is not characterized by the crags and crusty nubs associated with American fried chicken; it was described by Julia Moskin of \"The New York Times\" as a \"thin, crackly and almost transparent crust\". The chicken is usually seasoned with spices, sugar, and salt, prior to and after being fried. Korean fried chicken restaurants commonly use small- or medium-sized chickens; these younger chickens result in more tender meat. After frying, the chicken is usually hand-painted with sauce using a brush in order to evenly coat the chicken with a thin layer. Pickled radishes, beer, and soju are often served with Korean fried chicken.\n\nThe Korean word chikin () refers to fried chicken (and occasionally also to roasted chicken), while the name for the domesticated fowl is \"dak\" (). The word is shortened from peuraideu chikin (), which is a transliteration of the English phrase \"fried chicken\". According to the National Institute of Korean Language, the word \"chikin\" () refers to \"a dish made by coating chopped chicken with flour, and frying or baking it\". Fried chickens that are not chopped before frying are called \"tongdak\" (, \"whole chicken\"). Both \"chikin\" and \"tongdak\" are occasionally referred to as dak-twigim (, \"chicken fritter\").\n\nThe unshortened form \"peuraideu chikin\", despite being the \"correct\" transliteration, is not as popular in Korea. The more commonly used form, huraideu-chikin (), may have been adopted in Korean owing to residual influence from the Japanese convention that persisted in Korea in the 1970s (the Japanese forced occupation only ended in 1945). The phrase \"huraideu-chikin\" is often shortened to huraideu () and refers to a fried chicken dish without the added seasonings post-frying. This is often used to differentiate it from yangnyeom-chikin (, \"seasoned chicken\"). The National Institute of Korean Language does not recognize \"huraideu-chikin\" as the conventional name, but insists on the transliteration (and transvocalization) \"peuraideu-chikin\", which it also insists should be \"refined\" to dakgogi-twigim (, \"chicken meat fritter\").\n\nThe concept of frying chicken in Korea has its beginning during the Korean War, when American troops stationed in South Korea during the late-1940s, and the early-1950s. Traditionally, Koreans steamed chicken for consumption, and chicken dishes usually came in soups and broth. This all changed however, when Americans began placing stalls selling soul-food American fried chicken, focusing on the four areas of Seoul, Busan, Pyeongtaek and Songtan.\n\nThe modern trend of eating chicken began in Korea during the late 1960s, when Myeongdong Yeongyang Center in Seoul began selling whole chicken roasted over an electric oven.\n\nThe first Korean fried chicken franchise, Lims Chicken, was established in 1977 in the basement of Shinsegae Department Store, Chungmu-ro, Seoul by Yu Seok-ho. Yu stated that his idea of selling smaller, individual pieces of fried chicken in Korea came along in 1975 when he went to go study abroad in the United States. He began frying chicken there, and received accolades for creating 'ginseng chicken'. He started his business in Korea with six pieces of fried chicken between ￦280 to ￦330, and sold around 900 pieces as his beginning career.\n\nThe well-known variety with spicy coatings, also known as \"yangnyeom-chikin\", had its history begin in 1982 by Yang Hee-Kwon, who was running Pelicana Chicken at Daejeon. He noticed that customers in his restaurant were struggling to chew on the hard, crisp layers of the fried chicken, and led to inconveniences such as scraped palates. Yang decided to pull a twist on the traditional fried chicken to soften the hard shells of the chicken, and appease more Korean customers by marinating it sweet, and spicy. Yang states that despite the spicy flavor, the very first \"yangnyeom-chikin\" did not include gochujang as one of their marinating ingredients.\n\nIn recent years, owing to market saturation in Korea, many of Korea's major fried chicken chains, such as Mexicana Chicken, Genesis BBQ, Kyochon Chicken and Pelicana Chicken, have expanded to set up new presences in the United States, China, Canada, and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Saraswat cuisine differs from sub-Saraswat Brahmin sects and region. Saraswat cuisine originally hails from Goa, India. Goan Saraswat cuisine is known throughout the western coast of India. Each variation has its unique flavour and makes uses of different vegetables and fruits available in the region. Saraswat cuisine is usually pesco-vegetarian.\nThis community regards seafood in general as vegetables from the sea. They refrain from eating any land-based animals..\n\nTheir curries use a lot of coconut, coconut oil, tamarind, and curry leaves and the cuisine is largely influenced by South Indian cuisine. It is slightly similar to Malvani or Konkani and Udupi or Mangalorean cuisine. Their cuisine is less spicy and has less Portuguese cuisine influences than the cuisine of their Goan Catholic counterparts. \"Hooman ani Xit\" (fish curry and parboiled rice) is the staple food of the Saraswat Brahmins of Goa, whereas the regular consumption of Indian breads such as \"puris\", \"chapatis\" and \"parathas\" are seen mainly amongst the Saraswat Brahmin of Maharashtra, India. Satvik Brahmin (sub-sect of Saraswat Brahmins) cuisine is similar to Jain cuisine, which is a strictly vegetarian cuisine that does not use vegetables that are plucked from underground, such as onions, potatoes, garlic, etc. Dishes such as \"Savalem ranapp\" are prepared among the Bhats (Priests), Orthodox Goud Saraswat Brahmins and Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmins. This is followed by most Konkani families on Holy days and on festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi follow this style of cooking. On certain days (Mondays in particular), all Saraswat Brahmins eat only vegetarian food. This is particularly true in families whose \"Kuldev\" (family deity) or other family deities like Mangesh, Nagueshi or any other form of Lord Shiva.\n\nThis cuisine forms a part of lacto-vegetarian cuisine. This cuisine has the combination of Goan, Udupi and Malvani cuisine culture.\n\"Khatkhatem\", a stew containing at least six vegetables, is popular. Other popular dishes include \"bhaji\" or \"shaak\" (made from different vegetable curry and fruit), \"vaal bhaji\" (a curry/dish made out of drumsticks) \"usli/usal\" (spicy pulses in a thin watery gravy), \"misal\" ( topped with fried snacks), \"tondak\" (beans combined with cashews), \"rass\" (coconut-based dishes), \"undri\" (a dish made out of rice flour, jaggery, and coconut), \"ghawan\" (a special variant of dosa, which is similar to \"neer dose,\" a Tuluva dish) \"hoomans\" (different types of curries), \"karams\" (vegetable salads), \"lonche\" (Indian pickles) and \"papads/happal\" (flatbread). Fast foods include \"Moongacho gathi\" (curried green gram), \"botatyache patal bhaji\" (potato curry), \"tur dal ross\" (split pigeon pea curry), etc.\n\nThis is unique and its various forms have been published in the Ras Chandrika book both in Marathi and English. These are recipes that would have been passed down from mother to daughter or daughter-in-law. It is out of print and each copy is guarded zealously by the owner though at least one upstart has included them in a vegetarian cookbook. The cuisine consists either of curries and vegetables made with ground fresh coconut gratings or tempered beans, sprouts, pulses (dals) garnished with coconut gratings. However, nowadays, for health reasons, the use of coconut gratings is kept to a minimum. Typical Bhanap or Amchi (as the Chitrapur Saraswats refer to themselves) dishes are Batata Song (potatoes cooked with tamarind, onions, garlic, chili powder and turmeric), Kairus (ground coconut base with spices, capsicum, potatoes, tamarind, peanuts and cashews), sukke (ground coconut base, spices and a variety of vegetables like potatoes, knolkhol (kohlrabi), peas, cauliflower, okra, ghashees, and ambats, all coconut-based. Apinmedi pickle made with a certain variety of raw mango is a staple.\n\nMost Saraswat Brahmins are pesco-vegetarians. The inclusion of fish in the diet is not looked upon as non-vegetarian. Legend has it that when the Saraswati River dried up, the Saraswats who could not farm were permitted to eat sea food/fish. The fish were euphemistically called \"sea vegetable\" or झळकें from ( जल काय -Jal Kaay). Oysters, for example, are sometimes called \"samudra phalam\", or \"sea fruit\".\n\nA typical breakfast in a Saraswat home may include \"pez\" (congee) of \"ukdem tandhul\" (parboiled rice) and \"lonche\" (pickles) and papad. Wealthier homes may serve dosa, idli (in South Canara, Karnataka and other parts of South India) or \"sannas\" (in Goa), along with chutney or \"sambhar\". \"Shevaiyn phann\" or \"phow\" are other breakfast foods occasionally served. Rotis and bhakris are typical types of bread eaten along with \"tondak\" or seasoned \"batatabhaji\" (potato stir-fry preparation).\n\nLunch and dinner may feature \"daat dalitoi\" and rice (\"xit\", pronounced \"sheeth\") in a \"Dorke\"'s home, whereas \"Bhanaps\" would prefer \"ambat\" with their rice for \"kalvani\". A typical Saraswat lunch would have \"sheeth\", \"roass\" or \"varann\"; if the diner is not vegetarian, lunch may include \"hoomann\", \"bhaji\", \"tondak\", \"lonche\", \"papodd\", and \"toi\" or \"kadhi\". Kadhi is made to serve the dual purpose of \"mukhashuddhhi\" (mouth purification, perhaps after all the relatively spicy stuff) and \"jeervonn\" (digestive kadhis include asafoetida, \"vomvom, jeera\", fennel seed). Sometimes the \"kadhis\" are seasoned simply with \"karivel\" and \"sanswam\" (mustard seeds). Typically, this is a watery preparation which the luncher cups in his hand as it is poured onto his plate and drinks it before mixing a small portion of his rice with it to eat at the end of the meal. The most savoured as well as preferred \"kadhis\" amongst the Konkani Saraswat Brahmins is the \"kokumachi kadhi\" or \"konkam kadhi\". Kokum is a fruit found and grown within the western Konkan coast of India and is commonly used in Saraswat cuisine. Formally it is often said that no meal is complete without \"kokum khadhi\".\n\n"}

{"id": "12143913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12143913", "title": "Fruit preserves", "text": "Fruit preserves\n\nFruit preserves are preparations of fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored in glass jam jars.\n\nMany varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, \"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies.\n\nThe term 'preserves' is usually interchangeable with 'jams'. Some cookbooks define preserves as cooked and gelled whole fruit (or vegetable), which includes a significant portion of the fruit. In the English speaking world, the two terms are more strictly differentiated and, when this is not the case, the more usual generic term is 'jam'.\n\nThe singular \"preserve\" or \"conserve\" is used as a collective noun for high fruit content jam, often for marketing purposes. Additionally, the name of the type of fruit preserves will also vary depending on the regional variant of English being used.\n\nA chutney is a relish of Indian origin made of fruit, spices and herbs. Although originally intended to be eaten soon after production, modern chutneys are often made to be sold, so require preservatives – often sugar and vinegar – to ensure they have a suitable shelf life. Mango chutney, for example, is mangoes reduced with sugar.\n\nWhile confit, the past participle of the French verb \"confire\", \"to preserve\", is most often applied to preservation of meats, it is also used for fruits or vegetables seasoned and cooked with honey or sugar till jam-like. Savory confits, such as ones made with garlic or fennel, may call for a savory oil, such as virgin olive oil, as the preserving agent.\n\nKonfyt (Afrikaans: \"jam\" or \"fruit preserve\") is a type of jam eaten in Southern Africa. It is made by boiling selected fruit or fruits (such as strawberries, apricots, oranges, lemons, water melons, berries, peaches, prickly pears or others) and sugar, and optionally adding a small quantity of ginger to enhance the flavour. The origins of the jam is obscure but it is theorized that it came from the French. The word is also based on the French term \"confiture\" via the Dutch \"confijt\" (meaning candied fruit).\n\nA conserve, or whole fruit jam, is a preserve made of fruit stewed in sugar. Traditional whole fruit preserves are particularly popular in Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) where they are called varenye, the Baltic region where they're known by a native name in each of the countries (, , , ), as well as in many regions of Western, Central and Southern Asia, where they are referred to as murabba.\n\nOften the making of conserves can be trickier than making a standard jam; it requires cooking or sometimes steeping in the hot sugar mixture for just enough time to allow the flavour to be extracted from the fruit, and sugar to penetrate the fruit; and not cooking too long such that the fruit will break down and liquify. This process can also be achieved by spreading the dry sugar over raw fruit in layers, and leaving for several hours to steep into the fruit, then just heating the resulting mixture only to bring to the setting point. As a result of this minimal cooking, some fruits are not particularly suitable for making into conserves, because they require cooking for longer periods to avoid issues such as tough skins. Currants and gooseberries, and a number of plums are among these fruits.\n\nBecause of this shorter cooking period, not as much pectin will be released from the fruit, and as such, conserves (particularly home-made conserves) will sometimes be slightly softer set than some jams.\n\nAn alternative definition holds that conserves are preserves made from a mixture of fruits or vegetables. Conserves may also include dried fruit or nuts.\n\nFruit butter, in this context, refers to a process where the whole fruit is forced through a sieve or blended after the heating process.\n\nFruit curd is a dessert topping and spread usually made with lemon, lime, orange, or raspberry. The basic ingredients are beaten egg yolks, sugar, fruit juice and zest which are gently cooked together until thick and then allowed to cool, forming a soft, smooth, intensely flavored spread. Some recipes also include egg whites or butter.\n\nAlthough the FDA has \"Requirements for Specific Standardized Fruit Butters, Jellies, Preserves, and Related Products\", there is no specification of the meaning of the term Fruit spread. Although some assert it refers to a jam or preserve with no added sugar, there are many \"fruit spreads\" by leading manufacturers that do contain added sugar. This can be easily verified by searching the listings under \"fruit spread\" on common web sites, such as those of Amazon or Walmart, or to look at the ingredient list and nutritional information on specific fruit spread products.\n\nJam typically contains both the juice and flesh of a fruit or vegetable, although one cookbook defines it as a cooked and jelled puree. The term \"jam\" refers to a product made of whole fruit cut into pieces or crushed, then heated with water and sugar to activate its pectin before being put into containers:\nPectin is mainly D-galacturonic acid connected by α (1–4) glycosidic linkages. The side chains of pectin may contain small amounts of other sugars such as L-fructose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-xylose. In jams, pectin is what thickens the final product via cross-linking of the large polymer chains.\n\n\"Freezer jam\" is uncooked (or cooked less than 5 minutes), then stored frozen. It is popular in parts of North America for its very fresh taste.\n\nRecipes without added pectin use the natural pectin in the fruit to set. Tart apples, sour blackberries, cranberries, currants, gooseberries, Concord grapes, soft plums, and quinces work well in recipes without added pectin.\n\nOther fruits, such as apricots, blueberries, cherries, peaches, pineapple, raspberries, rhubarb, and strawberries are low in pectin. In order to set, or gel, they must be combined with one of the higher pectin fruits or used with commercially produced or homemade pectin. Use of added pectin decreases cooking time.\n\nIn Canada, fruit jam is categorized into two types: fruit jam and fruit jam with pectin. Both types contain fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit and are boiled with water and a sweetening ingredient. Both must have 66% water-soluble solids. Fruit jam and fruit jam with pectin may contain a class II preservative, a pH adjusting agent or an antifoaming agent. Both types cannot contain apple or rhubarb fruit.\n\nThough both types of jam are very similar, there are some differences in fruit percent, added pectin and added acidity. Fruit jam must have at least 45% fruit and may contain added pectin to compensate for the natural pectin level found in the fruit. Fruit jam with pectin need only contain 27% fruit and is allowed to contain added acidity to compensate for the natural acidity of the fruit.\n\nIn North America, jelly (from the French \"gelée\") refers exclusively to a clear or translucent fruit spread made from sweetened fruit (or vegetable) juice—thus differing from jam by excluding the fruit's flesh—and is set by using its naturally occurring pectin, whereas outside North America jelly more often refers to a gelatin-based dessert, though the term is also used to refer to clear jams such as blackcurrant and apple.\nIn the United Kingdom, redcurrant jelly is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday roast. It is a clear jam, set with pectin from the fruit, and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.\n\nPectin is essential to the formation of jelly because it acts as a gelling agent, meaning when the pectin chains combine, they create a network that results in a gel. The strength and effectiveness of the side chains and the bonds they form depend on the pH of the pectin, the optimal pH is between 2.8–3.2.\n\nAdditional pectin may be added where the original fruit does not supply enough, for example with grapes.\nJelly can be made from sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the additional step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette \"jelly bag\" is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can come in a variety of flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n\nMarmalade is a fruit preserve made from the juice and peel of citrus fruits boiled with sugar and water. It can be produced from lemons, limes, grapefruits, mandarins, sweet oranges, bergamots and other citrus fruits, or any combination thereof. Marmalade is generally distinguished from jam by its fruit peel.\n\nThe benchmark citrus fruit for marmalade production in Britain is the Spanish Seville orange, \"Citrus aurantium\" var. \"aurantium\", prized for its high pectin content, which gives a good set. The peel has a distinctive bitter taste which it imparts to the preserve. In America, marmalade is sweet.\n\nIn general, jam is produced by taking mashed or chopped fruit or vegetable pulp and boiling it with sugar and water. The proportion of sugar and fruit varies according to the type of fruit and its ripeness, but a rough starting point is equal weights of each. When the mixture reaches a temperature of 104 °C (219 °F), the acid and the pectin in the fruit react with the sugar, and the jam will set on cooling. However, most cooks work by trial and error, bringing the mixture to a \"fast rolling boil\", watching to see if the seething mass changes texture, and dropping small samples on a plate to see if they run or set.\n\nCommercially produced jams are usually produced using one of two methods. The first is the open pan method, which is essentially a larger scale version of the method a home jam maker would use. This gives a traditional flavor, with some caramelization of the sugars. The second commercial process involves the use of a vacuum vessel, where the jam is placed under a vacuum, which has the effect of reducing its boiling temperature to anywhere between 65 and 80 °C depending on the recipe and the end result desired. The lower boiling temperature enables the water to be driven off as it would be when using the traditional open pan method, but with the added benefit of retaining more of the volatile flavor compounds from the fruit, preventing caramelization of the sugars, and of course reducing the overall energy required to make the product. However, once the desired amount of water has been driven off, the jam still needs to be heated briefly to to kill off any micro-organisms that may be present; the vacuum pan method does not kill them all.\n\nDuring commercial filling it is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down tamper-evident safety button when used.\n\nGlass or plastic jars are an efficient method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it in a jar is far more useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low water activity and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within a short period of time.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published standards of identity in 21 CFR 150, and treats jam and preserves as synonymous, but distinguishes jelly from jams and preserves. All of these are cooked and pectin-gelled fruit products, but jellies are based entirely on fruit juice or other liquids, while jams and preserves are gelled fruit that may include the seeds and pulp. The United States Department of Agriculture offers grading service based on these standards.\n\nUnder the Processed Products Regulations (C.R.C., c. 291), jams, jellies, citrus marmalade and preserves are defined. Each must contain a minimum percentage of the named fruit and a minimum percentage of water-soluble solids. Jams \"shall be the product made by boiling fruit, fruit pulp or canned fruit to a suitable consistency with water and a sweetening ingredient\", jellies \"shall be the product made by boiling fruit juice or concentrated fruit juice that is free from seeds and pulp with water and a sweetening ingredient until it acquires a gelatinous consistency.\"\n\nIn the European Union, the jam directive (Council Directive 79/693/EEC, 24 July 1979) set minimum standards for the amount of \"fruit\" in jam, but the definition of fruit was expanded to take account of several unusual kinds of jam made in the EU. For this purpose, \"fruit\" is considered to include fruits that are not usually treated in a culinary sense as fruits, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and pumpkins; fruits that are not normally made into jams; and vegetables that are sometimes made into jams, such as rhubarb (the edible part of the stalks), carrots, and sweet potatoes. This definition continues to apply in the new directive, Council Directive 2001/113/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée intended for human consumption.\n\nExtra jam is subject to somewhat stricter rules that set higher standards for the minimum fruit content (45% instead of 35% as a general rule, but lower for some fruits such as redcurrants and blackcurrants), as well specifying as the use of unconcentrated fruit pulp, and forbidding the mixture of certain fruits and vegetables with others.\n\nExtra jelly similarly specifies that the quantity of fruit juice or aqueous extracts used to make 1,000 grams of finished product must not be less than that laid down for the manufacture of extra jam.\n\n\n\n"}

Saxophonist Niels Mathiasen initially joined the group in 1994; however, he did not become a full-time member of the group until 1997. \n\nDuring their first six months, The Alligators became familiar in the Copenhagen area as performers on the street and in undistinguished bars. Then, in the spring of 1991, a demonstration recording of theirs reached the mainland, with the outcome that they signed an exclusive booking and management contract with the well established CBA agency. From that point, the band grew increasingly successful, and by the end of 1991 The Alligators were considered one of the hardest working rock'n'roll bands in Denmark.\n\nIn 1992 they played more than 200 shows, recorded their debut album \"Rock'n'roll ball\", played engagements as the back-up band for The Jordanaires, and toured in the Greek islands. Also in that year, the band formed a productive association with singer and entertainer Mek Pek, following a performance in late February that developed into an all night jam session. By late 1992, they had together formed the band Mek & The Pekabillies.\n\nMuch studio work occupied the band in 1993: the recording of \"Mek & The Pek'a'billies\", and of children's songs for the \"Aah Abe\" project. Also that year, they made several television appearances, played many concerts, and in November journeyed to the United States, for inspiration. In early 1994, Mek & The Pekabillies, on behalf of all artists involved, accepted the Danish Grammy Award for best album in the category \"Songs for children\", for the \"Aah Abe\" project, which to date has sold more than 400,000 copies in Denmark, whose population is 5.5 million.\n\nIn the summer of 1994 The Alligators were introduced to American singer Wanda Jackson. During the recording of her album \"Let's have a party\", Jackson was so impressed with the band that she demanded that, when recording and touring Scandinavia, it must be with The Alligators. This resulted in two albums and one annual tour. About the same time, The Alligators met Danish-based, Scottish piano player and singer Stan Urban, which led to several live performances and some recording sessions.\n\nThe spring of 1995 brought more live work, and that summer The Alligators went into the Country Sound Studio to start recording their album \"The history of rock'n'roll\", which included guest performances by a host of rockabilly veterans including Scotty Moore, Wanda Jackson and The Jordanaires.\n\nThe recording of \"The Queen Of Rockabilly\", the band's second album with Jackson, took place at the Pek Farm Studio, Ormslev, Denmark, in the early summer of 1996, followed by a minor tour in Denmark.\n\nThe band spent most of 1997 touring, including a Wanda Jackson tour of Germany. They also established their own studio and record label that year.\n\nBy January 1998 The Alligators ended their contract with CBA agency, and started pre-production work on a new album, this time concentrating on original material. During the same period they increasingly often performed as a quartet, the original trio being augmented with Scandinavia's leading tenor saxophone player, Niels Mathiasen, an old friend from the Pekabilly days.\n\nBy 1999, The Alligators were independent artists and very well known in the circles of Scandinavian music. Their first major undertaking of that year was an unprecedented tour of Greenland. This two-week tour of Greenland's west coast was something of a cultural shock, leaving a lasting impression on everybody involved. Transport was by large and small airplanes, helicopters and even dog sled. Summer is the season when motorcycle and hot rod enthusiasts assemble, camp, and party, and The Alligators are often the entertainment at these affairs, ensuring a couple of busy and enjoyable months for them, throughout the nation. In October, they went into the studio to begin recording a new album of original material. After recording some songs, they broke to do more writing, performing and planning. The millennium ended with The Alligators returning to Greenland for a new year's evening concert and celebration at Kangerlussuaq, the former American air base.\n\nAs of 2007, The Alligators are still touring.\n\n\n\n"}

Amalu (Malpua) is one of the Chapana Bhoga of Lord Jagannath and is included in the Sanja Dhupa (evening prayer). Other variations of Malpua use pineapples or mangoes instead of bananas. Bengali, Maithili and Odia malpua is traditionally made only with thickened milk and a little flour (sometimes rice flour instead of wheat flour).\n\nMalpua in northern India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, don't contain fruit. There are several variations, using some or all of the following ingredients: maida (refined flour), semolina, milk, and yogurt. The batter is left to stand for a few hours before being spooned into a kadhai of hot oil to form a bubbling pancake which should be crisp around the edges. The pancakes are then immersed in a thick sugar syrup. Malpua is a popular sweet to make on the Hindu religious occasion of Holi. Malpua along with mutton curry is served in many non-vegetarian Maithil homes during Holi.\n\nMalapua in Nepal also known as Marpa is specially made in the Kathmandu Valley which uses maida, mashed up ripe bananas, fennel seeds, pepper corns, milk and sugar into a batter and prepared in a similar way as in India.\n\nMalpua is a famous dish during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Muslim families across India, as well as Pakistan prepare malpuas for iftar (meal to break the fast). This malpua includes maida, rawa, and khoya/ mawa (milk solids), and is deep fried to take the shape of a pancake. In some recipes, malpuas are dipped in sugar syrup called sira before serving.

{"id": "12256371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12256371", "title": "Mosaic authorship", "text": "Mosaic authorship\n\nMosaic authorship is the Jewish, Christian and Muslim tradition that Moses was the author of the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. The books do not name any author, as authorship was not considered important by the society that produced them, and it was only after Jews came into contact with author-centric Hellenistic culture in the late Second Temple period that the rabbis began to find authors for their scriptures. The tradition that Moses was this author probably began with the law-code of Deuteronomy, and was then gradually extended until Moses, as the central character, came to be regarded not just as the mediator of law but as author of both laws and narrative.\n\nBy the 1st century CE it was already common practice to refer to the five books as the \"Law of Moses\", but the first unequivocal expression of the idea that this meant authorship appears in the Babylonian Talmud, an encyclopedia of Jewish tradition and scholarship composed between 200–500 CE. There the rabbis noticed and addressed such issues as how Moses had received the divine revelation, how it was curated and transmitted to later generations, and how difficult passages such as the last verses of Deuteronomy, which describe his death, were to be explained. This culminated in the 8th of Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith, establishing belief in Mosaic authorship as an article of Jewish belief.\n\nMosaic authorship of the Torah was unquestioned by both Jews and Christians until the European Enlightenment, when the systematic study of the five books led the majority of scholars to conclude that they are the product of many hands and many centuries. Despite this, the role of Moses is an article of faith in traditional Jewish circles and for some Christian Evangelical scholars, for whom it remains crucial to their understanding of the unity and authority of Scripture.\n\nThe Torah (or Pentateuch, as biblical scholars sometimes call it) is the collective name for the first five books of the Bible - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. It forms the charter myth of Israel, the story of the people's origins and the foundations of their culture and institutions, and it is a fundamental principle of Judaism that the relationship between God and his chosen people was set out on Mount Sinai through the Torah.\n\nThe development of the Torah began by around 600 BCE when previously unconnected material began to be drawn together; by around 400 BCE these books, the fore-runners of the Torah, had reached their modern form and began to be recognised as complete, unchangeable, and sacred; and by around 200 BCE the five books were accepted as the first section of the Jewish canon. It seems that the tradition of Mosaic authorship began with Deuteronomy, which scholars generally agree was composed in Jerusalem during the reform program of King Josiah in the late 7th century; it is this law-code that books such as Joshua and Kings (completed in the mid 500s) mean when they speak of the \"torah of Moses.\" In later books such as Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah the meaning had expanded to include the other laws such as Leviticus, and by Hellenistic times Jewish writers referred to the entirety of the five books, narrative and laws, as the Book (or books) of Moses.\n\nAuthorship was not considered important by the society that produced the Hebrew Bible (the Protestant Old Testament), and the Torah never names an author. It was only after c. 300 BCE, when Jews came into contact with author-centric Greek culture, that the rabbis began to feel compelled to find authors for their books, and the process which led to Moses becoming identified as the author of the Torah may have been influenced by three factors: first, by a number of passages in which he is said to write something, frequently at the command of God, although these passages never appear to apply to the entire five books; second, by his key role in four of the five books (Genesis is the exception); and finally, by the way in which his authority as lawgiver and liberator of Israel united the story and laws of the Pentateuch.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud, an encyclopedia of Jewish scholarship composed between 200–500 CE, states that \"Moses wrote his own book and the section concerning Balaam.\" The medieval sage Maimonides (c.1135–1204) enshrined this in his Thirteen Principles of Faith (a summary of the required beliefs of Judaism), the 8th of which states: \"I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah presently in our possession is the one given to Moses.\" The rabbis explained that God wrote the Torah in heaven before the world was created, in letters of black fire on parchment of white fire, and that Moses received it by divine dictation, writing the exact words spoken to him by God. The rabbis also explained how the Torah was handed down to later generations: \"Moses received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, Joshua to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the men of the Great Assembly,\" who in turn transmitted it to the rabbis. (The Great Assembly, according to Jewish tradition, was called by Ezra to ensure the accurate transmission of the Torah of Moses when the Jews returned from exile). Orthodox rabbis therefore say that thanks to this chain of custodians the Torah of today is identical with that received by Moses, not varying by a single letter.\n\nThe rabbis were aware that some phrases in the Torah do not seem to fit with divine dictation of a pre-existent text, and this awareness accounts for a second tradition of how the divine word was transmitted: God spoke and Moses remembered the divine words and wrote them down afterwards, together with some explanatory phrases of his own. This explanation is a minority one, but it explains, for example, why every step in the description of the construction of the Tabernacle is followed by the phrase, \"As the Lord commanded Moses.\"\n\nThere were also passages which seemed impossible for Moses to have written, notably the account of his own death and burial in last verses of Deuteronomy: the Talmud's answer is that \"Joshua wrote ... [the last] eight verses of the Torah,\" yet this implied that the Torah was incomplete when Moses handed it to Israel; the explanation of the rabbis was that the verses were indeed by Moses, but written \"with tears in his eyes\" as God dictated to him this description of his end.\n\nMore serious were a few passages which implied an author long after the time of Moses, such as Genesis 12:6, \"The Canaanite was then in the land,\" implying a time when the Canaanites were no longer in the land. Abraham ibn Ezra (c.1092–1167) made a celebrated comment on this phrase, writing that it contains \"a great secret, and the person who understands it will keep quiet;\" the 14th century rabbi Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils responded that Moses had written this and similar passages, as he was a prophet, but that it made no difference whether they were by him or some later prophet, \"since the words of all of them are true and inspired.\" \n\nFinally, there were a few passages which implied that Moses had used pre-existing sources: a section of the Book of Numbers (Numbers 10:35 — 36) is surrounded in the Hebrew by inverted nuns (the equivalent of brackets) which the rabbis said indicated that these verses were from a separate book, the Book of Eldad and Medad.\n\nBiblical scholars today agree almost unanimously that the Torah is the work of many authors over many centuries. A major factor in this rejection of the tradition of Mosaic authorship was the development of the documentary hypothesis, which understood the Pentateuch as a composite work made up of four \"sources,\" or documents, compiled over centuries in a process that was not concluded until long after Moses' death. The documentary hypothesis aroused understandable opposition from traditional scholars. One of the most significant was David Zvi Hoffmann (1843–1921), who attempted to defend Mosaic authorship by demonstrating that the sources identified by the documentary hypothesis were, in fact, pre-exilic; if this were proven, he believed, then the hypothesis itself was dis-proven. The most he would concede to the proponents of the hypothesis was that Moses may have written various scrolls over his career and that these may have been collated and united before his death. Another important Jewish scholar, and one still active, is David Weiss Halivni (b.1927): he has developed a theory of \"Chate'u Yisrael\", literally, \"Israel has sinned\", which states that the originally monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours and neglected the Torah of Moses, with the result that it became \"blemished and maculated;\" only on the return from Babylon did the people once again accept the Torah, which was then recompiled and edited by Ezra as evidenced in Ezra–Nehemiah and Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah. He further states that while the text of the Torah was corrupted, oral tradition was preserved intact, which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details. Menachem Mendel Kasher (1895–1983), taking a different approach, accepted the documentary hypothesis but adapted it to the Mosaic tradition, pointing to certain traditions of the Oral Torah which show Moses quoting Genesis prior to the epiphany at Sinai; based on a number of Bible verses and rabbinic statements, he therefore suggested that Moses made use of documents authored by the Patriarchs when redacting that book. This view is supported by some rabbinical sources and medieval commentaries which recognize that the Torah incorporates written texts and divine messages from before and after the time of Moses.\n\nThe Christian scriptures showed Jesus himself recognised Moses as the author of at least some portions of the Pentateuch (e.g., the Gospel of John, verses 5:46–47), and the early Christians therefore followed the rabbis. Like them, they addressed those passages which seemed to cast doubt on the Mosaic tradition: Saint Jerome, for example, felt that \"unto this day\" implied an author long after the time of Moses, presumably the 5th century BCE sage Ezra. Martin Luther similarly concluded that the description of Moses' death was by Joshua – but believed that the question itself was of no great importance.\n\nJerome and Luther and others still believed that the bulk of the Pentateuch was by Moses, even if a few phrases were not, but in the 17th century scholars began to seriously question its origins, leading Benedict Spinoza to declare that \"the Pentateuch was not written by Moses but by someone else.\" This conclusion had major implications, for as the 18th century Jewish scholar David Levi pointed out to his Christian colleagues, \"if any part [of the Torah] is once proved spurious, a door will be opened for another and another without end.\"\n\nBy the late 19th century scholars almost universally accepted that the Book of Deuteronomy dated not from the time of Moses but from the 7th century BCE, and that the Pentateuch as a whole had been compiled by unknown editors from various originally distinct source-documents. As David Levi had feared, the questioning of Mosaic authorship had led to a profound skepticism towards the very idea of revealed religion. Gradually the various Christian churches came to accept the conclusions of scholarship, and when in the 1940s the Vatican lifted a ban on Catholic scholars investigating the origins of the Pentateuch, it left support for Mosaic authorship limited largely to conservative Evangelical circles. This is tied to the way Evangelicals view the unity and authority of scripture: in the words of the Zondervan Encyclopedia of the Bible, \"Faith in Christ and faith in the books of the OT canon stand or fall together [because] Christ and the apostles ... took the Pentateuch as Mosaic [and] put their seal on it as Holy Scripture.\" Nevertheless, the majority of contemporary Evangelicals, while accepting that some or much of the Pentateuch can be traced to Moses or traditions about him, pay little attention to the question of authorship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12258892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12258892", "title": "Cusco School", "text": "Cusco School\n\nThe Cusco School (Escuela Cuzqueña) or Cuzco School, was a Roman Catholic artistic tradition based in Cusco, Peru (the former capital of the Inca Empire) during the Colonial period, in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. It was not limited to Cuzco only, but spread to other cities in the Andes, as well as to present day Ecuador and Bolivia.\n\nThere are high amount of Cusco School's paintings preserved, currently most of them are located at Cusco, but also currently there are in the rest of Peru and in museums of Brazil, England and United States.\n\nThe tradition originated after the 1534 Spanish conquest of the Peru, and it is considered the first artistic center that systematically taught European artistic techniques in the Americas. The Spanish contribution, and in general European, to the Cusco School of painting, is given from very early time, when the construction of the Cathedral of Cusco begins. However, It is the arrival of the Italian painter Bernardo Bitti in 1583, the one that marks a first moment of the development of Cuzqueño art. This Jesuit introduces in Cusco one of the fashionable currents in Europe of then, the Mannerism, whose main characteristics were the treatment of figures in a somewhat elongated way, with the light focused on them.\n\nDuring his two stays in Cusco, Bitti was commissioned to make the main altarpiece of the church of his Order, replaced by another after the earthquake, and painted some masterpieces, as \"The Coronation of the Virgin\", currently in the museum of the church of La Merced, and the \"Virgen del pajarito\", in the cathedral.\nAnother of the great exponents of Cusqueño mannerism is the painter Luis de Riaño, born in Lima and a disciple of Italian Angelino Medoro. In the words of the Bolivians historians José de Mesa and Teresa Gisbert, authors of the most complete history of Cuzqueño Art, Riaño lords in the local artistic environment between 1618 and 1640, leaving, among other works, the murals of the church of Andahuaylillas. Also it emphasizes in these first decades of 17th century, the muralist Diego Cusihuamán, with works in the churches of Chinchero and Urcos.\n\nThe Baroque in the Cuzqueña painting is mainly the result of the influence of the Tenebrism trending through the work of Francisco de Zurbarán and of the use as a source of inspiration of the engravings with Felmish art from Antwerp. Marcos Ribera, born in Cusco in 1830, is the maximum exponent of this tendency. Five of apostles of him can be seen in the church of San Pedro, two in the altarpiece and another in a side reredos. The monastery of Santa Catalina of Arequipa keeps \"La Piedad\", and that of St. Francis, some of the canvases that illustrate the life of the founder of the Order, belonging to various authors.\n\nThe increasing activity of Indian-Quechua and mestizo painters towards the end of 17th century, makes the term of Cusco School conform more strictly to this artistic production. This painting is \"Cuzqueña\", otherwise, not only because it comes from the hands of local artists, but mainly because it moves away from the influence of the predominant trending in European art and follows its own path.\n\nThis new Cuzqueño art is characterized, in the thematic, by the interest in Costumbrista subjects as, for example, the procession of Corpus Christi, and by the presence, for the first time, of Andean flora and fauna. A series of portraits of Indian caciques and genealogical and heraldic paintings also appear. As for the technical treatment, there is a misunderstanding of the perspective added to a fragmentation of the space in several concurrent spaces or compartmentalized scenes. New chromatic solutions, with a predilection for the intense colors, they are another typical feature of the nascent pictorial style.\n\nAn event occurred at the end-17th century, was decisive for the direction taken by Cuzqueña painting. In 1688, after permanent conflicts, there is a rupture in the corporation of painters that ends with the removal of the Indian-Quechua and Mestizo painters due, according to them, to the exploitation they were subjected by their Spanish colleagues. From this moment, free of the impositions of the corporation, the Indian and mestizo artists are guided by their own sensibility and transfer to the canvas their mentality and their way of conceiving the world.\n\nThe most famous series of the Cuzco School is undoubtedly that of the sixteen paintings of the Corpus Christi series, which originally were in the church of Santa Ana and are now in the Museum of Religious Art of the Archbishopric of Cusco, except for three that are in Chile. From an anonymous painter of the late-17th century (some researchers attribute them to the workshops of Diego Quispe Tito and Pumacallao), these canvases are considered true masterpieces because of the richness of their color, the quality of the drawing and how well they achieved the portraits of the main characters of each scene. The series has enormous historical and ethnographic value, because it shows in detail the various social strata of Colonial Cusco, as well as a large number of other elements of a ferstival that already then it was central in the life of the city.\n\nThe most original and important Indian painter is Diego Quispe Tito, born in the parish of San Sebastián, near to Cusco, in 1611 and active almost until end the century. It is in the work of Diego Quispe Tito that some of the characteristics of Cuzqueña painting will be prefigured, as a certain freedom in the handling of perspective, a previously unknown role of the landscape and the abundance of birds in the leafy trees that are part of the same. The motive of the birds, especially the Amazon forest's parrot, is interpreted by some researchers as it refers to the Inca nobility.\n\nThe most valuable part of Quispe Tito's work is located in the church of his native town, San Sebastián. Highlights the series of twelve compositions on the life of St. John the Baptist, in the main nave of the church. Of great mastery are also the two enormous canvases dedicated to Saint Sebastian, that of the \"asaetamiento\" and that of the death of the saint. Famous is, finally, the series of the Zodiac that the artist paints for the Cathedral of Cuzco towards 1680.\nAnother outstanding painter of Cusco School is Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao, of indigenous ancestry like Quispe Tito, but unlike him, much more attached to the canons of Western painting within the Baroque current. Active in the second half of the 17th century, Santa Cruz leaves the best of his work in the Cathedral of Cusco, as he is commissioned to decorate the walls on the side of the choir and the arms of the transept. In the picture of the \"Virgin of Bethelem\", located in the choir, there is a portrait of the bishop and patron Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo that help quite to the developing of the Cusco Painting School and the city.\n\nSuch is the fame reached by the Cusqueña painting of the 17th century, which during the following century produces a singular phenomenon that, curiously, left its mark not only in art but in the local economy. We refer to the industrial workshops that make canvases in large quantities by order of merchants who sell these works in cities such as Trujillo, Ayacucho, Arequipa and Lima, or even in much more distant places, in the current Argentina, Chile and Bolivia. The painter Mauricio García, active towards the mid-18th century, signs, for example, a contract to deliver about five hundred canvases in seven months. Of course it was what was known as \"ordinary\" painting to differentiate it from the painting of fine \"brocateado\", with a much more elaborate and colorful design.\n\nThe most important artist of the 18th century is Marcos Zapata. His pictorial output, which spans more than 200 paintings, ranges between 1748 and 1764. The best are the fifty large canvases that cover the high arches of the Cathedral of Cusco and that are characterized by the abundance of flora and fauna as a decorative element.\n\nThe Cuzqueña paintings were a form of religious art whose main purpose was didactic. The Spanish, who aimed to convert the Incas to Catholicism, sent a group of religious artists to Cusco. These artists formed a school for Quechua people and mestizos, teaching them drawing and oil painting. The designation \"Cusqueña,\" however, is not limited to the city of Cusco or to indigenous artists, as Spanish creoles participated in the tradition as well.\n\nA major patron of the Cuzco artists was Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo, who collected European art and made his collection available to Peruvian artists. He promoted and financially assisted such Cusqueña artists such as Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao, Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka, and Marcos Rivera.\n\nCusco School paintings were made by mestizos, Quecha-Indians and Whites-creoles.\n\nThe defining characteristics of the Cusqueña style are believed to have originated in the art of Quechua painter Diego Quispe Tito.\n\nCusqueña paintings are characterized by their use of exclusively religious subjects, their lack of perspective, and the predominance of red, yellow and earth colors. They are also remarkable for their lavish use of gold leaf, especially with images of the Virgin Mary. Though the Cusqueño painters were familiar with prints of Byzantine, Flemish and Italian Renaissance art, their works were freer than those of their European tutors; they used bright colors and distorted, dramatic images. They often adapted the topics to depict their native flora and fauna as a backdrop in their works.\n\nWarrior angels became a popular motif in Cusqueña paintings.\n\nMost Cusqueña paintings were created anonymously because of Pre-Columbian traditions that define art as communal. An exception is one of the last members of the Cuzco School, Marcos Zapata (c. 1710-1773). Other known artists of the Cuzco School include Diego Cusihuamán, Gregorio Gamarra, Basilio Santa Cruz Pumacallao (1635-1710), and Antonio Sinchi Roca Inka. Related to the school is the Master of Calamarca, in 18th century, Bolivia.\n\nThe largest collection of paintings from the Cuzco school is in the Cathedral of Santo Domingo (Cusco). The Lima Art Museum and the Inca Museum also house important collections.\n\nA large number of works were destroyed in the 18th century so there is a limited supply of Cuzco school paintings. In recent years there has been a significant increase in demand from both Latin American art collectors and certain museums for paintings from the Cusco school period. In 2010, the American government repatriated two Cusco and Lima style paintings to Peru that had been illegally brought into the United States in 2005.\n\n\nThere is a known project to national level called \"Vírgenes Urbanas\" in which the paintings of the Cusco school are recreated replacing the bodies by Indigenous people, as well as Indigenous angels, Virgin Marys and saints like Rose of Lima with new Indigenous faces in order to represent the current Peruvian population. In addition to the paintings, they also do Indigenous photo montages on recreations of the paintings. According to them, the Cusco School is a symbol of the power of the colonizer \"representing images with Caucasian features, imposing ideas, religion and Western stereotypes\" and the project re-poses them with new signs that refer directly to the descendants of the former victims. \n\nThese new paintings are also exhibited in many museums throughout the country.\n\nToday Peruvians paints replicas of Colonial Cusco paintings that sell to tourists.\n\n\n"}

They are intended to be wedged into a crack or other opening in the rock, and do not require a hammer to place. They were developed as an alternative to pitons, which are hammered into cracks and are more prone to damage the rock. Most commonly, a carabiner will be used to join the hex to the climbing rope by means of a loop of webbing, cord or a cable which is part of the hex.\n\nHexes are a type of nut, a hollow eccentric hexagonal prism with tapered ends, usually threaded with webbing, a swaged cable, or a cord. They are manufactured by several firms, with a range of sizes varying from about wide. Climbers select a range of sizes to use on a specific climb based on the characteristics of the cracks in the rock encountered on that particular climb. Sides may be straight or curved although the functioning principles remain the same no matter which shape is selected; the lack of sharp corners on curved models may make them easier to remove from the rock.\n\nHexes may be placed either as passive or active protection. When placed passively they work like chock stones in flared cracks, like other climbing nuts, just larger and with a different shape. Active protection is achieved by orienting the webbing so that a pull causes a camming action against the rock similar to Tricams, allowing for placement in parallel cracks. They are often preferred by alpine mountaineers over spring-loaded camming devices because of their lack of moving parts and overall lower weight for the same size crack.\n\nThe original hexes were invented by Yvon Chouinard and Tom Frost, and called \"Hexentrics\". The \"polycentric\" hexentric was designed by Swedish/Norwegian climber Tomas Carlstrom and given to Chouinard Equipment in 1973. They applied for a U. S. patent in 1974 and it was granted on April 6, 1976. Hexes were produced by Chouinard Equipment, Ltd until 1989, when it was sold as a design to Black Diamond Equipment. They are now produced and sold in much the same design today.\n"}

This article outlines the kōsen school system in Japan.\n\nThe \"kōtō-senmon-gakkō\", often abbreviated to \"kōsen\" (高専, high-special-school literally, 高等専門学校 ) is a 5-year school for students 15 years old or older. There are 63 institutions in Japan; most were established by the national government. Most of the institutions are technical schools, each with an enrollment of about 200 students per grade, focusing on engineering and mercantile marine studies.\n\nThere are a total of 63 colleges of technology in Japan, of which 55 are national, five are public (established by local government) and three are private. Of the 63 institutions, five focus on marine mercantile studies while the rest are engineering schools.\n\nThere are approximately 60,000 students in the colleges, including roughly 3000 students in advanced programmes that follow completion of the initial 5-year programme. About 10,000 students graduate annually. The number is approximately 10% of the 4-year university graduates in engineering.\nTypically, one college has ca. 500 - 800 students, distributed in several departments.\n\nThe 55 national public colleges are united under one governing body, the National Institute of Technology. However, each college have a certain level of autonomy and led by its own president. The official name of each college is \"National Institute of Technology, XXXX College\", with \"XXXX\" representing the name of the place where the college is situated.\n\nThe colleges of technology were established starting in 1962 to respond to a need for well-trained manpower in the rapidly growing industrial sector. The colleges are distributed throughout Japan and many are in comparatively small population centres. Most of the national colleges were established by 1974 but the Okinawa college was only established in 2002 (accepting its first students in 2004).\n\nStudents usually enter the colleges after lower secondary school (grade nine in the North American system or year ten in the British system). Therefore, students follow a 6-3-5 pattern of study (six years of elementary, three years of lower secondary and five years of college) rather than the more typical 6-3-3-4 system more commonly found in Japan. Entrance is by examination though some students may be accepted by recommendation. A few students are accepted after secondary school into the fourth year of the programme. The engineering programmes are 5 years in length while the marine mercantile programmes are 5.5 years duration. At the end of the programme, students are awarded an “Associate” credential.\n\nWithin the engineering programmes, students may choose from a variety of sub-areas. These include chemical engineering, biotechnology, electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering, information systems and control technologies.\n\nWhile many graduates enter the work force, around 40% go on to further post-secondary education. Graduates of the colleges are in high demand both by companies and by prestigious universities such as the University of Tokyo.\n\nSeveral colleges of technology have developed their own advanced programmes (専攻科) which are one to two years in length. Upon completion of these programmes, graduates may be awarded degrees by application to the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation. Some colleges, such as the Wakayama College, received special permit from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, and Technology of Japan, to confer a BS in Engineering degree at the end of the advanced programme, and thus graduates do not have to apply to the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation in order to receive their bachelor's degree.\n\nIn 2002, the Committee on the Future of National Colleges of Technology was established. Following the Committee's 2003 final report, a Law concerning the Institute of National Colleges of Technology, Japan was enacted with the Institute coming into operation in 2004.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12320179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12320179", "title": "Pedodiversity", "text": "Pedodiversity\n\nPedodiversity is the variation of soil properties (usually characterised by soil classes) within an area. \nPedodiversity studies were first started by analyzing soil series–area relationships (Beckett and Bie, 1978). According to Guo et al. (2003) the term \"pedodiversity\" was developed by McBratney (1992) who discussed landscape preservation strategies based on pedodiversity. Recently, examinations of pedodiversity using indices commonly used to characterize bio-diversity have been made Ibáñez et al. (1995) first introduced ecological diversity indices as measures of pedodiversity. They include \nSpecies richness, abundance, and Shannon index. Richness is the number of different soil types, which is the number of soil classes at particular level in a taxonomic system. Abundance is defined as the distribution of the number of soil individuals.\n\nJust as biologists and ecologists talk about biodiversity, geologists on geodiversity, soil scientists can talk about pedodiversity. Pedodiversity has some overlap with biodiversity as soil contains organisms. Pedodiversity is a measure of soil variation, and pedodiversity is a function of soil formation.\n\nPedodiversity can be thought as a way to preserve, or even reconstruct, the soil cover. Just as biologists argue that organisms need to be maintained, soil scientists can argue that preserving soil will maintain organisms as well as other unique soil materials equally crucial in insuring our future wellbeing. In areas which have been degraded it will become important to reconstruct the variation. A quantitative knowledge of natural pedodiversity will ease the task of the person who attempts to rebuild quasi-natural soil systems.\n\nSoil scientists have pragmatically adapted the concept of biodiversity and used diversity index such as Shannon index using taxa from well-accepted international soil classification systems.\n\nJonathan Phillips showed that in eastern North Carolina intrinsic variability within homogeneous landscape units is more important in determining the total pedodiversity of the study area than is the extrinsic variability associated with measurable differences in topography, parent material, and vegetation/land use.\nIn another study, they found that soils in Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas vary considerably within small more-or-less homogeneous areas, and richness–area analysis shows that the overall pattern of pedodiversity is dominated by local, intrinsic (within-plot) variability as opposed to between-plot variability. This is consistent with variation controlled mainly by individual trees and local lithological variations. Given the criteria used to distinguish among soil types, biomechanical as opposed to chemical and hydrological effects of trees are indicated. Results also suggest divergent evolution whereby the pedologic effects of trees are large and long-lived relative to the magnitude of the initial effects and lifespan of the plants.\n\nGuo et al. recently explored quantitative aspects of pedodiversity for the USA based on the State Soil Geographic database (STATSGO). They found that the West USDA-NRCS geographical region has the highest soil taxa richness, followed by the Northern Plains. The South Central region has the highest taxa evenness, while taxa evenness in the West region is the lowest. The West or the South Central regions have the highest overall soil diversity in the four highest taxonomic categories, while the West or Northern Plains regions have the highest diversity in the two lowest taxonomic levels. The high diversity index in the West region results from high taxa richness while the high diversity index in the South Central region results from an evenness of taxa. As the taxonomic level decreases, the pattern of taxa abundance approaches a lognormal distribution. One of the key findings of this research is that at lower levels of soil taxonomic divisions (especially the series level), soil taxa increase continuously with increasing area, indicating considerable soil endemism in the USA (and likely around the world), a key consideration in conservation and preservation\nplanning.\n\nHowever conventional diversity measures, only measure the relative abundance of soil classes, and there is no information on the taxonomic similarity or differences between soil classes. New measures of pedodiversity, such as the mean soil taxonomic distance, which considers both information on the relative abundance and the taxonomic differences between soil classes have been developed and shown to be a better measure.\n\nThe diversity of soils and landforms has hardly received any attention although their spatial and temporal variation may produce important quantitative and qualitative changes in the landscape. It is only in the last few years that the term diversity has also caught the attention of scientists working on soils and other fields within the earth sciences which creates a forum and research projects on geodiversity. Measurements of diversity were introduced to pedology few years ago. The concept of pedodiversity is now widely accepted within the soil science community. Pedodiversity, as well as biodiversity, may be considered as a framework to analyze spatial patterns, being recognized as a novel pedometric tool. Pedodiversity is a measure of soil variation and also a function of soil formation and development or evolution. Pedodiversity is introduced to pedology to analyze soil spatial patterns, soil geography, and test the pedogenetic theories. Thus, pedodiversity is not only concerned with analysis of the pedotaxa number in a given area or region, but it should tackle also with the pedological structures, spatial pedotaxa and soilscapes structure.\n\n"}

They are highly reactive because of their large surface area. In the presence of oxygen and water, they rapidly oxidize to form free iron ions. They are widely used in medical and laboratory applications and have also been studied for remediation of industrial sites contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds.\nIron nanoparticles can be synthesized by the reduction of Fe(II) or Fe(III) salt with sodium borohydride in an aqueous medium.\n\nWhen exposed to oxygen and water, iron oxidizes. This redox process can occur under either acidic or neutral/basic conditions:\n\nResearch has shown that nanoscale iron particles can be effectively used to treat several forms of ground contamination, including grounds contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated organic solvents, and organochlorine pesticides. Nanoscale iron particle are easily transportable through ground water, allowing for in situ treatment. Additionally, the nanoparticle-water slurry can be injected into the contaminated area and stay there for long periods of time. These factors combine to make this method of cheaper than most currently used alternative.\n\nResearchers have found that although metallic iron nanoparticles remediate contaminants well, they tend to agglomerate on the soil surfaces. In response, carbon nanoparticles and water-soluble polyelectrolytes have been used as supports to the metallic iron nanoparticles. The hydrophobic contaminants adsorb to these supports, improving permeability in sand and soil.\n\nIn field tests have generally confirmed lab findings. However, research is still ongoing and nanoscale iron particles are not yet commonly used for treating ground contamination.\n\n\n2.http://www.chalcogen.infim.ro/1771_Yuvakkaur.pdf\n\n"}

{"id": "12346894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12346894", "title": "Haurvatat", "text": "Haurvatat\n\nHaurvatat (Avestan: \"𐬵𐬀𐬎𐬬𐬀𐬙𐬁𐬙‎ \") is the Avestan language word for the Zoroastrian concept of \"wholeness\" or \"perfection.\"\nIn post-Gathic Zoroastrianism, Haurvatat was the Amesha Spenta associated with water (\"cf.\" \"apo\"), prosperity, and health.\n\nEtymologically, Avestan \"haurvatat\" derives from an Indo-Iranian root and is linguistically related to Vedic Sanskrit \"sarvatāt\" \"intactness, perfection\". The Indo-Iranian root has in turn Indo-European origins. In Common Era Zoroastrian tradition, Haurvatat appears as Middle Persian \"Hordad\", continuing in New Persian as \"Khordad\". The Iranian civil calendar of 1925, which adopted Zoroastrian calendar month names, has \"Khordad\" as the name of the 3rd month of the year. \n\nThe Avestan language noun \"haurvatat\" is grammatically feminine and in scripture the divinity Haurvatat is a female entity. However, in tradition (K)Hordad was/is considered male; this development is attributed to the loss of grammatical gender in Middle Persian. In \"Isis and Osiris\" 46, Plutarch translates Haurvatat as Πλοῦτος \"ploutos\" \"wealth, riches\" and equates the divinity with \"Plutus,\" the Greek god of riches.\n\nLike the other Amesha Spentas also, Haurvatat is already attested in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. And like most other principles, Haurvatat is not unambiguously an entity in those hymns. Unlike four of the other Amesha Spentas, Haurvatat does not have a standing epithet that in later Avesta texts becomes an element of her proper name.\n\nAlready in the Gathas, Haurvatat is closely allied with Ameretat, the Amesha Spenta of \"Immortality\". Addressing Ahura Mazda in \"Yasna\" 34.11, the prophet Zoroaster exclaims that \"both Wholeness and Immortality are for sustenance\" in the Kingdom of God. In the same verse, as also in \"Yasna\" 45.10 and 51.7, parallels are drawn between Ameretat and Haurvatat on the one hand and \"endurance and strength\" on the other.\n\nThe relationship between Ameretat and Haurvatat is carries forward into the Younger Avesta (\"Yasna\" 1.2; 3.1; 4.1; 6.17; 7.26; 8.1 etc.; \"Yasht\" 1.15; 10.92). The Younger Avestan texts allude to their respective guardianships of plant life and water (comparable with the Gathic allusion to sustenence), but these identifications are only properly developed in later tradition (see below). These associations with also reflect the Zoroastrian cosmological model in which each of the Amesha Spentas is identified with one aspect of creation.\n\nThe antithetical counterpart of Haurvatat is demon (\"daeva\") \"Tarshna\" \"thirst,\" while Ameretat's is \"Shud\" \"hunger.\" Ameretat and Haurvatat are the only two Amesha Spentas who are not already assigned an antithetical counterpart in the Gathas. In the eschatological framework of \"Yasht\" 1.25, Ameretat and Haurvatat represent the reward of the righteous after death (\"cf.\" Ashi and \"ashavan\"). Haurvatat and Ameretat will destroy the demons of hunger and thirst at the final renovation of the world (\"Yasht\" 19.95-96).\n\nUnlike Ameretat, Haurvatat has a \"Yasht\" consecrated to her (\"Yasht 4\"), and is invoked as the protector of the seasons and years (\"Yasht\" 4.0, \"Siroza\" 1.6, 2.6). In \"Yasht\" 4.1, Haurvatat is described as having been created by Ahura Mazda for \"the help, joy, comfort, and pleasure of the \"ashavan\".\" The righteous can put demons to flight by invoking the name of Haurvatat (\"Yasht\" 4.2). In \"Yasht\" 4.4, Haurvatat is implored to give mankind the power to withstand the seductive attacks of the \"Pairikas\", the devilish sprites of Angra Mainyu.\n\nThrough the association with plants and water, Ameretat (MP: \"Amurdad\") and Haurvatat (MP: \"Hordad\") are consequently identified with food and drink (\"cf.\" sustenance in the Gathas, above), and traditionally it was out of respect for these two Amesha Spentas (MP: \"Ameshaspand\") that meals were to be taken in silence. In \"Book of Arda Viraf\" 23.6–8, the righteous Viraz sees a man punished in hell \"for consuming Hordad and Amurdad while unlawfully chattering while he chewed.\"\n\nIn the \"Bundahishn\", a Zoroastrian account of creation completed in the 12th century, Ameretat and Haurvatat appear—together with Spenta Armaiti (MP: \"Spendarmad\"), the third female Amesha Spenta—on the left hand of Ahura Mazda (\"Bundahishn\" 26.8). Throughout Zoroastrian scripture and tradition, these three principles are most consistently identified with the creations that they represent: respectively plant life, water, and earth. In \"Arda Viraf\" 35.13, the three daughters of Zoroaster are described to be in the image of Armaiti, Ameretat, and Haurvatat. \n\nIn the hierarchy of \"yazata\"s, Haurvatat has as her assistants or cooperators (\"hamkars\") three lesser \"yazata\"s: \"Vata-Vayu\" of the wind and atmosphere, \"Manthra Spenta\" of \"bountiful spells\" and the Fravashis, the hordes of guardian spirits.\n\nIn the day-name and month-name dedications of the Zoroastrian calendar (that makes the basis for the Jalali calendar), the sixth day of the month and third month of the year are named after Haurvatat/Hordad/Khordad/Xordad and are under her protection. The Iranian civil calendar of 1925 reinstated Zoroastrian month-name conventions and hence also has \"Khordad\" as the third month of the year, beginning at May 22 (21. in leap years). This calendar is thus the one with which western astrology is most accurately corresponding. Khordad confers exactly with Gemini, the passage of the sun through the ecliptical segment of 60 - 90 degrees from vernal equinox.\n\nHaurvatat-Ameretat (Pahlavi \"hrwdʼd\" \"ʼmwrdʼd\") appears in Sogdian language texts as \"hrwwt mrwwt\". A relationship to Armenian \"hawrot\" \"mawrot\" has been suggested but is not confirmed. According to Islam tradition, Al-Quran mentions two entities sent to Babil (Babylon) named Harut and Marut, to test people faith because they teach witchcraft and sorcery. These entities stated that they were sent to test the faith of the people before teaching them.\n\n"}

It is so called because the original French fashion for long women's jackets was adopted from Basque traditional dress. In contemporary usage it refers only to a long item of lingerie, in effect a brassiere that continues down, stopping around the waist or the top of the hips, the lower part essentially decorative rather than providing support or indeed warmth.\n\nIn Victorian fashion, \"basque\" refers to a closely fitted bodice or jacket extending past the waistline over the hips; depending on era, it may be worn over a hoopskirt (earlier Victorian era) or bustle (later Victorian era). A basque bodice (i.e., when considered as a dress component, to be worn with a specific skirt) could also be referred to as a \"corset waist\", because of its close fit.\n\nThe modern French-language usage is completely different, much closer to the historic original, and usually used in the plural.\n\nIn 20th century and contemporary attire, the term is used to refer to certain articles of lingerie, particularly a type of corset known as a \"torsolette\", or alternately a torso-hugging camisole that resembles a corset (typically featuring decorative front or back lace-up detail), but of more delicate construction and offering little or no figure-moulding compression.

{"id": "12448204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12448204", "title": "Image quality", "text": "Image quality\n\nImage quality can refer to the level of accuracy in which different imaging systems capture, process, store, compress, transmit and display the signals that form an image. Another definition refers to image quality as \"the weighted combination of all of the visually significant attributes of an image\". The difference between the two definitions is that one focus on the characteristics of signal processing in different imaging systems and the latter on the perceptual assessments that make an image pleasant for human viewers.\n\nImage quality should not be mistaken with image fidelity. Image fidelity refers to the ability of a process to render a given copy in a perceptually similar way to the original (without distortion or information loss), i.e., through a digitization or conversion process from analog media to digital image.\n\nThe process of determining the level of accuracy is called Image Quality Assessment (IQA). Image quality assessment is part of the quality of experience measures. Image quality can be assessed using two methods: subjective and objective. Subjective methods are based on the perceptual assessment of a human viewer about the attributes of an image or set of images, while objective methods are based on computational models that can predict perceptual image quality. Objective and subjective methods aren't necessarily consistent or accurate between each other: a human viewer might perceive stark differences in quality in a set of images where a computer algorithm might not.\n\nSubjective methods are costly, require a large number of people, and are impossible to automate in real-time. Therefore, the goal of image quality assessment research is to design algorithms for objective assessment that are also consistent with subjective assessments. The development of such algorithms has a lot of potential applications. They can be used to monitor image quality in control quality systems, to benchmark image processing systems and algorithms and to optimize imaging systems.\n\nThe image formation process is affected by several distortions between the moment in which the signals travel through to and reach the capture surface, and the device or mean in which signals are displayed. Although optical aberrations can cause great distorsions in image quality, they are not part of the field of Image Quality Assessment. optical aberrations caused by lenses belong to the optics area and not to the signal processing areas.\n\nIn an ideal model, there's no quality loss between the emission of the signal and the surface in which the signal is being captured on. For example, a digital image is formed by electromagnetic radiation or other waves as they pass through or reflect off objects. That information is then captured and converted into digital signals by an image sensor. The sensor, however, has nonidealities that limit its performance.\n\nImage quality can be assessed using objective or subjective methods. In the objective method, image quality assessments are performed by different algorithms that analyze the distortions and degradations introduced in an image. Subjective image quality assessments are a method based on the way in which humans experience or perceive image quality. Objective and subjective methods of quality assessment don't necessarily correlate with each other. An algorithm might have a similar value for an image and its altered or degraded versions, while a subjective method might perceive a stark contrast in quality for the same image and its versions.\n\n\"See main article: Subjective video quality\"\n\nSubjective methods for image quality assessment belong to the larger area of psychophysics research, a field that studies the relationship between physical stimulus and human perceptions. A subjective IQA method will typically consist on applying mean opinion score techniques, where a number of viewers rate their opinions based on their perceptions of image quality. These opinions are afterwards mapped onto numerical values.\n\nThese methods can be classified depending on the availability of the source and test images:\n\nSince visual perception can be affected by environmental and viewing conditions, the International Telecommunications Union produced a set of recommendations for standardized testing methods for subjective image quality assessment.\n\nWang & Bovic (2006) classify the objective methods with the following criteria: (a) the availability of an original image; (b) on the basis of their application scopes and (c) on the model of a Human Visual System simulation to assess quality. Keelan (2002) classifies the methods based on (a) direct experimental measurements; (b) system modeling and (c) visual assessment against calibrated standards.\n\nImage quality metrics can also be classified in terms of measuring only one specific type of degradation (e.g., blurring, blocking, or ringing), or taking into account all possible signal distortions, that is, multiple kinds of artifacts.\n\n\n"}

In 1564, Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II and his brothers declared it by deed to be an \"inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria\". They valued this ancient precious stone carving, not just for its craftsmanship, but for a \"natural miracle\" in the stone itself that reveals a mysterious inscription—the name \"XRISTO\" (\"Christ\") at the bottom of the bowl within the grain of the stone. It is now generally believed that the inscription inspired the legend that the bowl was the Holy Grail. The Agate Bowl is the largest carved stone bowl in the world.\n\nThe Agate Bowl is 76 cm (30 in) wide including the handles. The bowl is cut from a single, massive block of agate, the largest carved stone bowl in the world.\n\nThe Agate Bowl dates from the fourth century and is believed to have been created at the court of Constantine. Its first documented reference is in a deed from 1564 written by Holy Roman Emperor Maximillian II and his brothers, declaring the bowl to be an \"inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria\", to be owned by the entire House of Habsburg. In 1619, an inventory of the estate of Holy Roman Emperor Matthias records, \"the word KRISTO is to be seen in quite large letters in the nature of the stone\".\n\nFrom the seventeenth to the twentieth century, documented descriptions of an inscription \"B.XRISTO.RI.XXPP\" was seen as a reference to Jesus Christ. Because the writing seemed to be neither painted nor carved in the bowl, but appeared in the natural veining of the stone itself, the Agate Bowl was regarded a relic, even considered to be the Holy Grail.\n\nIn 1951, after the relic was restored, the inscription was reinterpreted by art historian Rudolf Egger to read \"ARISTO\", the name of the stone cutter.

The neuter noun thus also connotes \"(divine) royal glory,\" reflecting the perceived divine empowerment of kings. The term also carries a secondary meaning of \"(good) fortune\"; those who possess it are able to complete their mission or function.\n\nIn 3rd-7th century Sassanid-era inscriptions as well as in the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, the word appears as Zoroastrian Middle Persian \"khwarrah\", rendered with the Pahlavi ideogram \"\", reflecting Aramaic \"gada\" \"fortune.\" Middle Persian \"khwarrah\" continues as New Persian \"k(h)orra\". These variants, which are assumed to be learned borrowings from the Avestan, are the only Iranian language forms with an initial 'xᵛ-'. In all other dialects, the word has an initial \"f-\" (see details under related terms, below).\n\nAvestan \"khvarenah\" is probably derived from Proto-Avestan \"*hvar\" \"to shine,\" nominalized with the \"-nah\" suffix. Proto-Avestan \"*hvar\" is in turn related to Old Indic \"svar\" with the same meaning, and together descending from Proto-Indo-Iranian *\"súHr̥\" \"to shine\", ultimately from Proto-Indo-European \"*sóhr\" \"to shine\". Other proposals suggest a linguistic relationship with Avestan \"xᵛar-\" \"to eat\".\n\nOf the numerous Iranian languages in which the word is attested, the initial \"xᵛ-\" is evident only as Avestan \"khvar(e)nah\" and as Zoroastrian Middle Persian \"khwarrah\", from which New Persian \"khorra\" then derives. In other Iranian dialects the word has an \"f-\" form, for instance as Median and Old Persian \"farnah-\", from which Middle- and New Persian \"farr(ah)\" and adjectival \"farrokh\" derive. For many decades, the \"f-\" form was believed to represent a specific Median sound-law change of proto-Iranian \"xᵛ-\" to \"f-\". The hypothesis has since been shown to be untenable, and the proto-Iranian form is today reconstructed as \"*hu̯\", preserved in Avestan as \"xᵛ-\" and dissimilated as \"f-\" in other Iranian dialects.\n\nIn the Iranian languages of the Middle Period, the word is also attested as Bactrian \"far(r)o\", Khotanese \"pharra\", Parthian \"farh\", Sogdian \"f(a)rn\", and Ossetic \"farnae\" and \"farn\", though in these languages the word does not necessarily signify \"glory\" or \"fortune\": \nIn Buddhism, Sogdian \"farn\" and Khotanese \"pharra\" signified a \"position of a Buddha,\" that is, with \"dignity\" or \"high position.\" This meaning subsequently passed into Tocharian. In Manicheanism, Sogdian \"frn\" signified \"luck\" and was a designator of the \"first luminary\". Manichean Parthian \"farh\" again signifies \"glory.\" In Scytho-Sarmatian and Alan culture, Digoron Ossetic \"farnae\" and Iron Ossetic \"farn\" signified \"peace, happiness, abundance, fortune.\"\n\nThe term also appears as a borrowing in Armenian \"pʿarkʿ\", but with a greater range of meaning than in Iranian languages.\n\nBisyllabic \"khvarenah\" is only attested once in the Gathas, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by the prophet himself. The one instance of Gathic \"khvarenah\" occurs in \"Yasna\" 51.18, where the word appears to mean royal glory. The primary source of information on \"khvarenah\" comes from the \"Yasht\"s, the younger Avesta's collection of 21 hymns dedicated to individual divinities.\n\nTwo distinct forms of \"khvarenah\" are discernible in \"Yasht\" 19:\nSimilarly \"Yasht\" 18, although nominally dedicated to Arshtat, is a short 9-verse ode to a third variant of \"khvarenah\"; the Iranian \"khvarenah\" (\"airiianəm xᵛarənah\") that is created by Ahura Mazda and that is \"full of milk and pastures,\" vanquishes the \"daeva\"s and the Un-Iranians.\n\n\"Yasht\" 19, which is nominally dedicated to Zam \"Earth\", further typifies \"khvarenah\" as a \"yazata\", that is, itself \"worthy of worship.\" The same hymn includes a list of divinities and mortals who perform their duties due to the power of \"khvarenah\". Among these are the \nmythological Kayanian kings – the \"kavi\"s (\"kauui\"s) – who are rulers through the grace of, and empowered by, \"khvarenah\".\n\n\"Khvarenah\" is however also glory held by divinities: Ahura Mazda has it (19.9-13), the Amesha Spentas have it (19.14-20), the other yazatas as well (19.21-24). Yima loses it thrice, in turn to Mithra, Thraetaona and Keresaspa. \"Khvarenah\" assumes the shape of a bird when leaving Yima. (19.35-36, 19.82)\n\nAccording to \"Yasht\" 13.14, the waters flow, the plants spring forth, and the winds blow through the \"khvarenah\" of the Fravashis. In \"Yasna\" 68.11, the waters of Aredvi Sura are invoked to bestow radiance and glory. \"Khvarenah\" is also associated with the waters in other texts; with the world-sea Vourukasha in \"Yasht\" 19.51 and 19.56-57; with the Helmand river in \"Yasht\" 19.66ff. It is also identified with Haoma, together with which it plays a seminal role in the legend of the birth of Zoroaster. In these passages, \"khvarenah\" has a seminal and germinal implication, being both fiery fluid and living seed.\n\nIn \"Yasna\" 60.2, the family priest is seen to request joy and blessings for the righteous, good nature, truth, prosperity, power, and glory for the house in which he offers prayers. The hymn to Mithra speaks of the divinity as the \"dispenser of \"khvarenah\"\" (\"Yasht\" 10.16, 10.128, 10.141). Other texts describe Mithra as \"most endowed with glory\" (\"Yasht\" 19.35, \"Vendidad\" 19.15).\n\nIn \"Yasht\" 19.46, Akem Manah, the demon of \"evil purpose\" attempts (but fails) to seize \"khvarenah\". The Iranian \"khvarenah\" and Dahman, the hypostasis of prayer, render Bushyasta - the demoness of \"sloth\" – powerless (\"Yasht\" l0.97, 13.4).\n\nAt the final renovation of the world, the royal glory will follow the \"Saoshyant\"s (\"Yasht\" 19.89).\n\nIn the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition \"khvarenah\" (→ Middle Persian \"khwarrah\") is a spiritual force that exists before the creation of the \"tan-gohr\", the mortal body (\"Bundahishn\" II.7ff, \"Zadspram\" 3.75). In these later texts, the glory appears to be acquirable through learning and knowledge (\"Bundahishn\" II.9ff).\n\n\"Khwarrah\" continues to be identified with astral bodies (\"Dadistan-i Denig\" I.25, I.35-36), but its primary function is in its role as the divine glory of kings, the continuation of the Avestan notion of the \"kavam khvarenah\". New in tradition is an identification of \"khwarrah\" with religion, as in \"the great \"khwarrah\"-bestowing force of the pure religion\" (\"Dadistan-i Denig\" I.36)\n\nThe \"Kar-namag i Ardashir\", a collection of hagiographic legends related to Ardashir, the founder of the Sassanid empire, includes (4.11.16 and 4.11.22-23) a tale in which Ardashir – who at that point in the story is still a vassal of the Arsacid Parthians – escapes from the court of the last Arsacid king, Ardavan. In the story, Ardashir makes off with much Ardavan's treasure, as well as Ardavan's favourite concubine, and is being chased by Ardavan and his troops. On the road, Ardavan and his contingent are overtaken by an enormous ram, which is also following Ardashir. Ardavan's religious advisors explain that the ram is the manifestation of the \"khwarrah\" of the ancient Iranian kings, which is leaving Ardavan and the Parthians in favor of a new emperor.\n\nThe representation of \"khwarrah\" as a ram reappears on Sassanid seals and as an ornament in Sassanid architecture. \"Khwarrah\" also appears in Sassanian crowns as a bird with a pearl in its beak. Depictions of \"khwarrah\" as a bird are allusions to the Avestan myth of \"Yasht\" 19.35-36, 19.82 in which \"khvarenah\" takes the shape of a bird as it leaves Yima (MP: Jamshid), a metamorphosis similar to that of the yazata of victory, Verethragna. The crown as a repository of \"khwarrah\" is also attested in the Paikuli inscription of Narseh, which describes the punishment meted out to an individual who has been \"driven by Ahriman and the \"dev\"s\" to steal \"khwarrah\" by placing the crown on the head of a false ruler. Another ubiquitous motif in Sassanian art is the symbol of a boar, which is a representation of the protection of the \"yazata\" Verethragna (MP: Wahram) given to rulers that hold \"khwarrah\".\n\nThe ring of kingship that appears in Sassanian investiture reliefs is often identified as representing \"khwarrah\". This is also the case for the ring held by the bearded figure in the Achaemenid winged sun-disk symbol that is traditionally considered to represent a \"fravashi\" (MP: \"fravahr\"). The Achaemenid winged sun-disk has in its entirety also been occasionally been interpreted as a representation of \"khvarenah\".\n\nThat \"khwarrah\" – in addition to its significance as \"royal fortune\" – also signified \"fortune\" in a general sense is demonstrated by the use of an Aramaic ideogram \"GDE\" in the Middle Persian texts of the Sassanid and post-Sassanid periods. The custom of using this Aramic ideogram to represent \"khvarenah\" is probably inherited from Achaemenid times.\n\n\"The fundamental motif of Iranian kingship, a hereditary dynastic charisma [...], which, could however be lost, was at the root of ideas that were widespread in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\" For example, as the \"tyche basileos, fortuna regia,\" the saving grace (luck) of fortune of a king; and probably also the royal \"farrah\" in the \"tyche\" of the various Hellenistic rulers of the Seleucid and Arsacid periods as well as of the Kushan kings.\n\nBecause the concepts of \"khvarenah\"/\"khwarrah\" and Aramaic \"gd(y)\" circulated in the same areas and have many characteristics in common, it is possible that the Mesopotamian concept influenced the Zoroastrian one. On the other hand, \"khvarenah\" may also be a facet of Zoroastrianism's Indo-Iranian cultural inheritance since \"khvarenah\" appears to have a parallel in Indic \"tejas\". in which kingship is likewise associated with the bright splendor and power of light and fire.\n\nThe concept of the royal \"khwarrah\" survived the 7th century downfall of the Sassanid empire, and remained a central motif (for instance as the \"farr-e elahi\") in the culture, philosophy and epics of Islamic Iran.\n\n\n"}

It is usually made with white flour, lard or olive oil, salt and water. The dough was traditionally cooked on a terracotta dish (called \"teggia\" in the Romagnol), although nowadays flat pans or electric griddles are commonly used.\n\nThe Piadina has been added to the list of the traditional regional food products of Italy of the Emilia-Romagna Region.\n\nThe Piadina is typical of the Apennines area of Forlì, Cesena and Rimini, and also of the Ravenna area and the rest of the Romagna region. It is also widespread in the areas of Montefeltro, Pesaro e Urbino province, Ferrara province and the Republic of San Marino.\n\nThe etymology of the word \"piadina\" is uncertain; many think the term \"piada\" (piê, pièda, pìda) was borrowed from the Greek word for focaccia. Others think the term was borrowed from other languages because of the large use of similar foods throughout the Eastern Roman Empire. The term \"Piada\" was officialized by Pascoli, who adapted the Romagnol word \"piè\" into its more Italian form. Romagna was heavily influenced by Byzantium during the early Middle Ages when the Eastern Empire reconquered parts of the Western domain which had fallen to the invading barbarians. In those days Ravenna was the capital city of the Exarchate, and that would explain how the Greco-Byzantine recipe entered the local gastronomy.\n\nThe first written evidence of Piadina as it is now recognized dates back to 1371, in the \"Descriptio Romandiolae\" compiled by Cardinal Anglico, who for the first time gave the recipe of the bread of the people of Romagna; \"It is made with wheat flour moistened with water and flavoured with salt. It is then kneaded with milk as well, and also a little lard.\"\n\nPiadine are usually sold immediately after preparation in specialized kiosks (called \"piadinerie\") filled with a variety of cheeses, cold cuts and vegetables, but also with sweet fillings such as jam or Nutella. There may be small differences depending on the zone of production. Piadine produced around Ravenna and Forlì are generally thicker, while those produced around Rimini and the Marche region are thinner and the diameter is greater.\n\nA Belgian company, owned by Swiss group Renzi AG, claims to own intellectual rights over a product called \"piadina\".\nThis can be easily circumvented, simply because piadina is the diminutive of piada and the ratio of ingredients, preparation and presentation can be changed at will.\n\nPiadina has even found its way to space, eaten by Russian cosmonauts as part of a mediterranean diet experiment on the International Space Station.\n\nAccording to Giovanni Pascoli,\n\n\n"}

The primary ingredients are whole black lentil (\"urad\"), red kidney beans (\"rajma\"), butter and cream. The dish gets its richness from the use of cream, but it can also be prepared with yogurt, milk or no dairy.\n\nDal makhani is a staple in the Indian subcontinent. It was popularized in India following partition, when many people from the Punjab migrated to the northern regions of India. As the Punjabi diaspora migrated across India and internationally, the dish was introduced to new locales by entrepreneurial Punjabi migrants Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Dass, who opened the Moti Mahal restaurant in Daryaganj, Delhi, India.\n\nDal makhani was first created by Punjabis and is now recognized as a quintessential Indian dish, and variations of the dish are served in many different restaurants internationally. Dal makhani's popularity is due in part to its versatility in a meal: the rich vegetarian dish can be served as a main meal, included as part of a buffet (\"thali\"), or used as an accompaniment to a meal. In India, soups and curries with a red or yellow lentil base are an important staple.\n\nThe traditional preparation of dal makhani involves a series of time-consuming procedures, which can take up to 24 hours to complete. With the availability of modern cooking equipment, namely pressure cookers, the preparation time of the dish has reduced significantly to 2–3 hours.\n\n\n"}

P. Bloch has written that \"The tradition of giving money (Chanukah gelt) to children is of long standing. The custom had its origin in the 17th-century practice of Polish Jewry to give money to their small children for distribution to their teachers. In time, as children demanded their due, money was also given to children to keep for themselves. Teenage boys soon came in for their share. According to Magen Avraham (18th century), it was the custom for poor yeshiva students to visit homes of Jewish benefactors who dispensed Chanukah money (Orach Chaim 670). The rabbis approved of the custom of giving money on Chanukah because it publicized the story of the miracle of the oil.\"\n\nAccording to popular legend, it is linked to the miraculous victory of the Maccabees over the ancient Greeks. To celebrate their freedom, the Hasmoneans minted national coins. It may also have begun in 18th-century Eastern Europe as a token of gratitude toward religious teachers, similar to the custom of tipping service people on Christmas. In 1958, the Bank of Israel issued commemorative coins for use as Hanukka gelt. That year, the coin bore the image of the same menorah that appeared on Maccabean coins 2,000 years ago.\n\nAmerican chocolatiers of the 20th century picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating chocolate \"gelt\". In the 1920s, Loft's, an American candy company, produced the first chocolate gelt, wrapped in gold or silver foil in mesh pouches resembling money bags.\n\nChocolate 'geld' is also given to children as part of St. Nicholas Day in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands (\"geld\", spelled with a \"d\", being both the Dutch and German word for money). Today most of the chocolate Hanukkah gelt sold in the United States is imported, including from Dutch firms Steenland Chocolate and the Israeli firms Elite and Carmit. Gourmet versions of chocolate gelt have been produced in the United States and Europe as well.\n\nParents often give children chocolate gelt to play dreidel with. In terms of actual \"gelt\" (money), parents and grandparents or other relatives may give sums of money as an official Hanukkah gift. According to a survey done in 2006, 74 percent of parents in Israel give their children Chanukah gelt.\n\nIn Hasidic communities, the Rebbes distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be an auspicious blessing from the Rebbe, and a \"segulah\" for success. The amount is usually in small coins.\n\n"}

In the United States the main organizing bodies are The Society of Hickory Golfers (SoHG) and the Golf Collectors Society; in Canada - The Canadian Golf Historical Society; and in the UK - The British Golf Collectors Society. There are also active groups in Switzerland, Sweden and Finland that conduct national tournaments.\n\nPart of the attraction of playing with hickory clubs is that they reintroduce 'feel' to the golf shot. Proponents also claim that hickory golf allows golfers to play classic golf courses as they are meant to be played.\n\nThere are two main divisions of play, pre-1935 and pre-1900. \n\nThe pre-1900 group play a Gutta-Percha style ball, and clubs are limited to those produced before 1900 or approved reproductions. Iron clubs are smooth-faced and woods are splice-necked. The main tournament for this group is the National Hickory Championship organized by Peter Georgiady. In June of 2019 it will conduct its 22nd Championship at the historic Mound Golf Course in Miamisburg, OH. The majority of the \"NHC\" tournaments have been conducted in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia at Oakhurst Links, as restored by Lewis Keller, and identified by the National Register of Historic Places as the oldest golf course in the United States. The two other venues have been Pinehurst No.8 & No.1 (one Championship) and The St. Martin's course of The Philadelphia Cricket Club (two Championships).\n\nThe pre-1935 group (vintage division) play with modern balls, but play is limited to clubs manufactured before 1935 or to authorized reproductions. There are numerous tournaments and championships.\n\nThere are a number of Championships conducted in countries around the world. The majority of the events are currently held in the United States and the United Kingdom. Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Australia, France and Finland have held events. Schedules of these events are available at Hickorygolf.com and the SoHG (hickorygolfers.com).\nThe French hickory golf Championship (francehickory.com) of La Société Française de Golf Hickory is the leading tournament of Continental Europe and since 2009 involves Professional Golfers.\nThe inaugural Championship during Centennial of Chantilly G.C. was remarked by never seen scores under PAR. It is the first prize money Championship of Continental Europe.\nThe Swiss Hickory Championship Days (swisshickory.ch) were inaugurated in 2011. They are held on the oldest golf course in Switzerland, the Engadine Golf Club - Since 1893 in St. Moritz/Samedan. Amateurs and Professionals are welcomed to participate in this hickory event. \n\nProbably the most prestigious tournament is The World Hickory Open Championship (www.worldhickoryopen.com), which was inaugurated in 2004 and played on Musselburgh Old Course, the oldest still surviving playing surface in the world (Guinness Book of Records).

Green tea is the national drink.\n\nPalav or osh, generically known as \"plov\" (pilaf), is a rice dish made with shredded yellow turnip or carrot, and pieces of meat, all fried together in vegetable oil or mutton fat in a special \"qazan\" (a wok-shaped cauldron) over an open flame. The meat is cubed, the carrots are chopped finely into long strips, and the rice is colored yellow or orange by the frying carrots and the oil. The dish is eaten communally from a single large plate placed at the center of the table, often in with one's hands in the traditional way.\n\nAnother traditional dish that is still eaten with hands from a communal plate is \"qurutob\" (), whose name describes the preparation method: \"qurut\" (, dried balls of salty cheese) is dissolved in water (, \"ob\") and the liquid is poured over strips of а thin flaky flatbread (\"patyr\" or \"fatir\", , or more accurately фатир равғанӣ, \"fatir ravghani\", i.e., fatir made with butter or tallow for flakiness). Before serving the dish is topped with onions fried in oil until golden and other fried vegetables. No meat is added. \"Qurotob\" is considered the national dish.\n\nMeals are almost always served with \"non\" (), flatbread found throughout Central Asia. If a Tajik has food but not \"non\", he will say he is out of food. If \"non\" is dropped on the ground, people will put it up on a high ledge for beggars or birds. Legend holds that one is not supposed to put \"non\" upside down because this will bring bad luck. The same holds true if anything is put on top of the \"non\", unless it is another piece of \"non\".\n\nTraditional Tajik soups include mainly meat and vegetable soups (such as shurbo and piti), and meat soups with noodles (such as laghmon and ugro). Other dishes shared regionally, either as fast food or as an appetizer, include \"manti\" (steamed meat dumplings), \"tushbera\" (pelmeni), \"sambusa\" (a triangular pastry with either a meat and onion stuffing or a pumpkin and onion stuffing, baked in a tandoor oven), and \"belyash\" (pl. \"belyashi\", , deep-fried cakes made of yeast dough and filled with minced meat, similar to pirozhki).\n\nSoviet cuisine both influenced and was in turn influenced by Tajik cuisine.\n\nDairy dishes, usually served as part of the spread of appetizers in a Tajik meal and scooped with pieces of flatbread, include \"chaka\" (a sour milk preparation), thick yogurt, and kaymak (high-fat clotted cream). \"Qurut\" balls may be served as a snack or an accompaniment to cold beverages. Although not a traditional Tajik drink, kefir, a drinking yogurt, is often served with breakfast.\n\nIn the summer, Tajikistan abounds in produce and fruit; its grapes and melons were famous throughout the former Soviet Union. The bazaar also sell pomegranates, apricots, plums, peaches, apples, pears, figs, and persimmons.\n\nTea generally accompanies every meal and is frequently offered between meals as a gesture of hospitality to guests and visitors. It is served hot in a china pot with a lid, and is drunk without sugar from small saucer-less cups without handles (\"piala\"). Because of the universal popularity of tea-drinking, the \"choykhona\" or teahouse, is the most common gathering place in Tajikistan, and is similar to the Western-style coffee house.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12907435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12907435", "title": "Modified Harvard architecture", "text": "Modified Harvard architecture\n\nThe modified Harvard architecture is a variation of the Harvard computer architecture that allows the contents of the instruction memory to be accessed as if it were data. Most modern computers that are documented as Harvard architecture are, in fact, modified Harvard architecture.\n\nThe original Harvard architecture computer, the Harvard Mark I, employed entirely separate memory systems to store instructions and data. The CPU fetched the next instruction and loaded or stored data simultaneously and independently. This is in contrast to a von Neumann architecture computer, in which both instructions and data are stored in the same memory system and (without the complexity of a CPU cache) must be accessed in turn. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. With microcontrollers (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. flash memory) and data (typically read/write memory) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different address spaces. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a von Neumann machine); it is also necessary to know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.\n\nA computer with a von Neumann architecture has the advantage over \"pure\" Harvard machines in that code can also be accessed and treated the same as data, and vice versa. This allows, for example, data to be read from disk storage into memory and then executed as code, or self-optimizing software systems using technologies such as just-in-time compilation to write machine code into their own memory and then later execute it. Another example is self-modifying code, which allows a program to modify itself. A disadvantage of these methods are issues with executable space protection, which increase the risks from malware and software defects. In addition, in these systems it is notoriously difficult to document code flow, and also can make debugging much more difficult.\n\nAccordingly, some pure Harvard machines are specialty products. Most modern computers instead implement a \"modified\" Harvard architecture. Those modifications are various ways to loosen the strict separation between code and data, while still supporting the higher performance concurrent data and instruction access of the Harvard architecture.\n\nThe most common modification builds a memory hierarchy with a CPU cache separating instructions and data. This unifies all except small portions of the data and instruction address spaces, providing the von Neumann model. Most programmers never need to be aware of the fact that the processor core implements a (modified) Harvard architecture, although they benefit from its speed advantages. Only programmers who write instructions into data memory need to be aware of issues such as cache coherency.\n\nAnother change preserves the \"separate address space\" nature of a Harvard machine, but provides special machine operations to access the contents of the instruction memory as data. Because data is not directly executable as instructions, such machines are not always viewed as \"modified\" Harvard architecture:\n\nA few Harvard architecture processors, such as the MAXQ, can execute instructions fetched from any memory segment – unlike the original Harvard processor, which can only execute instructions fetched from the program memory segment.\nSuch processors, like other Harvard architecture processors – and unlike pure von Neumann architecture – can read an instruction and read a data value simultaneously, if they're in separate memory segments, since the processor has (at least) two separate memory segments with independent data buses.\nThe most obvious programmer-visible difference between this kind of modified Harvard architecture and a pure von Neumann architecture is that – when executing an instruction from one memory segment – the same memory segment cannot be simultaneously accessed as data.\n\nThree characteristics may be used to distinguish modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard and von Neumann machines:\nFor pure Harvard machines, there is an address \"zero\" in instruction space that refers to an instruction storage location and a separate address \"zero\" in data space that refers to a distinct data storage location. By contrast, von Neumann and split-cache modified Harvard machines store both instructions and data in a single address space, so address \"zero\" refers to only one location and whether the binary pattern in that location is interpreted as an instruction or data is defined by how the program is written. However, just like pure Harvard machines, instruction-memory-as-data modified Harvard machines have separate address spaces, so have separate addresses \"zero\" for instruction and data space, therefore this does not distinguish this type of modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard machines.\nThis is the point of pure or modified Harvard machines, and why they co-exist with the more flexible and general von Neumann architecture: separate memory pathways to the CPU allow instructions to be fetched and data to be accessed at the same time, improving throughput. The pure Harvard machines have separate pathways with separate address spaces. Split-cache modified Harvard machines have such separate access paths for CPU caches or other tightly coupled memories, but a unified address space covers the rest of the memory hierarchy. A von Neumann processor has only that unified address space. From a programmer's point of view, a modified Harvard processor in which instruction and data memories share an address space is usually treated as a von Neumann machine until cache coherency becomes an issue, as with self-modifying code and program loading. This can be confusing, but such issues are usually visible only to systems programmers and integrators. Other modified Harvard machines are like pure Harvard machines in this regard.\nThe original Harvard machine, the Mark I, stored instructions on a punched paper tape and data in electro-mechanical counters. This, however, was entirely due to the limitations of technology available at the time. Today a Harvard machine such as the PIC microcontroller might use 12-bit wide flash memory for instructions, and 8-bit wide SRAM for data. In contrast, a von Neumann microcontroller such as an ARM7TDMI, or a modified Harvard ARM9 core, necessarily provides uniform access to flash memory and SRAM (as 8 bit bytes, in those cases).\n\nOutside of applications where a cacheless DSP or microcontroller is required, most modern processors have a CPU cache which partitions instruction and data.\n\nThere are also processors which are Harvard machines by the most rigorous definition (that program and data memory occupy different address spaces), and are only \"modified\" in the weak sense that there are operations to read and/or write program memory as data. For example, LPM (Load Program Memory) and SPM (Store Program Memory) instructions in the Atmel AVR implement such a modification. Similar solutions are found in other microcontrollers such as the PIC and Z8Encore!, many families of digital signal processors such as the TI C55x cores, and more. Because instruction execution is still restricted to the program address space, these processors are very unlike von Neumann machines.\n\nHaving separate address spaces creates certain difficulties in programming with high-level languages that do not directly support the notion that tables of read-only data might be in a different address space from normal writable data (and thus need to be read using different instructions). The C programming language can support multiple address spaces either through non-standard extensions or through the now standardized extensions to support embedded processors.\n\n"}

Bazaar Canton operated from 1971 to 1988 and was the first Asian food and retail store in the Livermore-Amador Valley. It provided an introduction to Asian culture for many residents in the Tri-Valley area.\n\nBazaar Canton was opened by Livermore resident, Amy Gee, a native of Shanghai, China and an accomplished Chinese watercolor artist. Family friends would have Chinese food for dinner at the Gee residence and ask Ms. Gee and her husband, Stanley Gee, a native of Canton, China and a mechanical design draftsman since 1956 at what is now called the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to purchase Chinese groceries from San Francisco and Oakland chinatowns for their own meals.\n\nEventually, the Gees decided to open a small Chinese grocery store called Bazaar Canton in a small Livermore shopping center at the east end of Second Street known as The Mall. When Bazaar Canton opened on April 1, 1971, Livermore had very few Asian residents and only two small Chinese American restaurants, the Yin Yin and Maly's.\n\nCanton Bazaar was originally considered for the name of the business but rejected because a San Francisco Chinatown store catering to tourists already had the name. An owner of the Way Up Gallery, a neighboring art gallery, suggested reversing the name, and the new business had its name.\n\nThe Livermore Symphony Guild asked Ms. Gee if she would teach Chinese cooking as a fundraiser for the Guild. She agreed and the lessons became extremely popular, prompting Ms. Gee to continue to give Chinese cooking lessons at her home. The popularity of her Chinese cooking lessons caused Bazaar Canton to quickly double in size by moving downstairs in The Mall and sell Chinese cookware, dishes, and utensils at the store. Sales continued to grow and Bazaar Canton tripled its space by moving to a street-front location at The Mall and began to feature a wide variety of Asian groceries, cookware, and gift items.\n\nBazaar Canton's final move to the JC Penney's shopping center in 1973 quadrupled the size of the store, dramatically increasing its selection of Asian gift items of all kinds, shapes, and varieties to the point where the store became more known to local shoppers as a gift store. At that time, the JC Penney's shopping center at Second Street and South L Street was the primary shopping center in Livermore. The store also began selling refrigerated Asian food items. Due to popular demand, the store in later years even began selling fresh Chinese deem sum dumplings and pastries from Oakland Chinatown on Saturday mornings. By 1973, Bazaar Canton became one of the larger retail establishments in Livermore. Bazaar Canton later opened a large branch gift store to service the growing suburban population in San Ramon, California. As the population of Livermore grew, and with it the city's Asian population, Bazaar Canton also served the new refugee Vietnamese American families in the town as a clearinghouse for community charitable donations and making available merchandise for those immigrant families.\n\nAfter a very successful 17 years in business, Ms. Gee had become a well-known and popular business owner in Livermore. In 1988, Mr. and Ms. Gee, Livermore residents since 1964, decided to retire after raising five children and close the store, to the disappointment of Ms. Gee's many customers. Their son Delbert Gee is an Alameda County Superior Court judge. Although the population of Livermore, and its Asian population, has significantly increased since 1988, Bazaar Canton is remembered by many long-time Livermore residents as their first introduction to Asian culture.\n\n"}

It is also sold in Germany, Norway and Sweden.\n\nIn the U.S. and other markets, Bulleit also offers a rye whiskey.\n\nAccording to Tom Bulleit, great-great-grandson of original creator Augustus Bulleit and developer of the modern brand, the first batch of Bulleit bourbon was made around 1830. Augustus continued to produce it through his death in 1860. The current recipe is substantially different from the whiskey produced by Augustus Bulleit, which used a mash bill of about two-thirds rye and one-third corn (which would make it a rye whiskey today rather than a bourbon).\n\nTom Bulleit began distilling his version in 1987, characterized by a high rye content and relatively lengthy aging.

The $115 million facility is located just east of Shelbyville in Shelby County, Kentucky. It is designed to eventually operate at a peak capacity of 1.8 million proof gallons annually.\n\nThe current Bulleit bourbon whiskey mash bill contains 68% corn (maize), 28% rye, and 4% malted barley.

This salted fish is dried in the sun and wind and is eaten after peeling off the skin. In some cases it is also smoked. It is sometimes referred to as \"fish biltong\".\n\nThe word \"bokkom\" comes from the Dutch word \"bokkem\", which is a variant of the word \"bokking\" (or \"buckinc\" in Middle Dutch). The word \"bokking\" is derived from the word \"bok\" (the Dutch word for \"buck\" or \"goat\"), and refers to the fact that bokkoms reminds of goat, because bokkoms has the same shape as the horns of a goat, it is just as hard as a goat's horns, and it stinks just as much as the horn of a goat (goats have scent glands behind their horns which causes the smell). The first official record of the use of the word in the Afrikaans language of South Africa was in the \"Patriotwoordeboek\" in 1902 in the form \"bokkom\".\n\nAs early as 1658, only six years after the first permanent settlement of Europeans at the Cape of Good Hope, four free burghers were given permission to settle in Saldanha Bay on the West Coast of Southern Africa. They were given the right from the Dutch East Indian Company to fish the waters of Saldanha Bay and send their catches to the Company's trading post at the Cape of Good Hope to be sold to other burghers as well as to passing ships in Table Bay. They had sole rights to the lucrative fishing until 1711. One fifth of the catch had to be delivered in salted and dried form, which was the origins of bokkoms in South Africa.\n\nThe ingredients for bokkoms consists of small (juvenile) mullet (fish), coarse salt and fresh water. The original West Coast way of preparing bokkoms starts with catching the small (juvenile) mullets (called \"harders\" in Afrikaans). A large square tank built out of bricks or stone is filled with a strong pickle made of around 50 kg of coarse salt and fresh water, to which the fish is added. As soon as enough fish is added to reach the top of the tank, two or three spades full of dry coarse salt is spread on top of the fish. Thereafter more layers of fish and salt is put on top until all the fish is covered in salt. A thick layer of salt is added to the top. This is left for one day. On the second day, a press made with wood with weights on top, is placed on the fish in the tank. The purpose of the press is to ensure that the guts of the fish is pressed flat so that it does not go bad. After the third day in the tank, the fish is taken out and is then stringed up in bunches of 10 to 25 fish each on a rope, making use of a fish needle which is pushed through the eyes of the fish. The bunches are then dipped 2 to 3 times in fresh water, before it is hung on scaffolds to dry.\n\nThe most suitable circumstances for drying is a lot of wind and not too harsh sunlight. At nighttime, the fish is brought under a roof to prevent it from drawing in damp, and the next day it is taken outside again to hang in the sun. The whole drying process takes about 5 days. More recently, people have started to make use of drying \"ovens\". This consists of a closed room with an electrical fan, in which the fish is hung. The fan blows heated air into the room. This simplifies the drying process considerably, since the fish does not need to be moved indoors every evening. This also allows drying to take place during the wetter winter months.\n\nBokkoms is a delicacy typical to the Western Cape of South Africa, and specifically the West Coast. Although it has a significant market in the Western Cape (where it is very popular and can be found in hotels, bars, bottle stores (in UK: off-licence), fish shops and beach kiosks on the beaches and holiday resorts), it has not been able to become a common product in the larger part of Southern African butcheries, fisheries and grocery stores like biltong has. It is, however, available for ordering and shipping through the internet in vacuum packed format.\n\nThere is a vibrant bokkom industry in the \"bokkom capital\" of the world, Velddrif, on the West Coast of South Africa. Around 95% of South Africa's bokkoms are produced in Velddrif, in a series of small individual factories located along the Berg river. Each factory has its own small jetty on the river at the front of the factory. In the past, large schools of mullet was caught in the river and the jetties were used as a place to tie the fishermen's \"bakkies\" (small boats) to unload their catch. Because of over-fishing, the catching of mullet in the river is now prohibited and it must be netted in the open sea just off Laaiplek.\n\nVelddrif is the ideal place for the bokkom industry. It has access to the mullet just off the coast, its weather conditions are ideal for drying the fish (dry summers and relatively low rainfall), and it has access to huge amounts of sea salt as spring tide pushes the sea over the extensive salt pans (the largest salt factory in South Africa where salt is extracted from sea water, the Cerebos salt factory, is also situated there). It also has access to fresh water in the form of the Berg river. It is thus no co-incidence that the bokkom industry originated and still continue to be situated in Velddrif. The well-known \"Bokkomlaan\" (Bokkom avenue) along the banks of the Berg river in Velddrif is a place where tourists can see large numbers of bokkoms strung up in bunches on rows of reed scaffolds along the side of the road.\n\nBokkoms is a unique, traditional delicacy of the West Coast of South Africa. It is best enjoyed with white wine, or with bread, apricot jam and black coffee, but can also be used in soups and spaghetti's, tapenades, ragout or just as a bite on its own.\n\nThere has been concern raised over declining fish stocks on the West Coast of South Africa. The Southern mullet is on the WWF Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative (SASSI) Orange list as an unsustainable species. This group includes species that have associated reasons for concern, either because the species is depleted as a result of overfishing and cannot sustain current fishing pressure, or because the fishing or farming method poses harm to the environment and/or the biology of the species makes it vulnerable to high fishing pressure. These species may be legally sold by registered commercial fishers and retailers. However, an increased demand for these could compromise a sustainable supply.\n\nThe word \"bokkoms\" has been taken up in the Afrikaans language in at least three proverbs:\n\n\nIt has also been used as the name for a specific family of plants with sharp seedpods found in South Africa. These plants have been given the name of bokkoms in Afrikaans because the seedpods look like bokkoms, and their unpleasant smell reminds of the strong fish smell of bokkoms.\n\nBokkoms are similar to dried herring, as well as bloaters, kippers and buckling. Bloaters (whole fish), kippers (split) and buckling (head and guts removed) are all lightly salted and smoked for a short period of time. Although the method for making bokkoms probably originated from the European method of making dried herring, bokkoms use a different species of fish (the mullet) and do not regularly make use of smoking in preparation of the delicacy.\n\nFoods that are similar to bokkoms include:\n\n"}

It is often served at fairs and festivals.\n\nThe origin of the term \"monkey bread\" comes from the pastry being a finger food: the consumer would pick apart the bread as a monkey would.\n\nWhat most people know as monkey bread today in the United States is actually the Hungarian dessert \"arany galuska\" (\"golden dumpling\"). Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nIn 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for \"arany galuska\", which they referred to as \"Hungarian Coffee Cake\". As it became more popular in America, \"arany galuska\" came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \"Monkey bread\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.\n\nRecipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States.\n\nThe bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans. It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.\n\n"}

It is commonly used to make cultured dairy products such as cheese. Some of the most popular sheep cheeses include feta (Greece), ricotta (Italy), and Roquefort (France).\n\nSpecialized dairy breeds of sheep yield higher amounts of milk compared to other breeds of sheep. Some of the most common dairy breeds include:\nIn the U.S., the most common dairy breeds are the East Friesian and the Lacaune. Finding a dairy sheep producer can be challenging, so some may choose a meat or wool breed, which do not produce as much milk as a dairy breed, but produce enough milk to create small amounts of cheese and other products. \n\nFemale sheep (ewes) do not produce milk constantly. Rather, they produce milk during the 80–100 days after lambing. Sheep naturally breed in the fall, which means that a majority of lambs are born in the winter or early spring. Milk production decreases and eventually stops when lambs are weaned or when the days become shorter. This means that milk cannot be produced year round. Through the use of controlled internal drug release (CIDR), ewes can be bred out of season. CIDR drugs contain progesterone, which is slowly released into the bloodstream, bringing the animal into estrus. In this way, ewes can be bred at different times throughout the year, providing farms with a year-round supply of milk.\n\nMeat and wool breeds of sheep lactate for 90-150 days, while dairy breeds can lactate for 120-240 days. Dairy sheep are able to produce higher yields of milk per ewe per year. Dairy sheep can produce 400-1100 lbs of milk per year while others sheep produce 100-200 lbs of milk per year. Crossbred ewes produce 300-650 lbs of milk per year.\n\nSheep milk cheeses include the feta of Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego of Spain; Serra da Estrela from Portugal; pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is \"pecora\"), pecorino Sardo, and ricotta of Italy; Pag cheese of Croatia; Ġbejna of Malta; and Gomolya of Hungary; and Bryndza (\"Slovenská bryndza\" from Slovakia, brânza de burduf from Romania and \"Bryndza Podhalańska\" from Poland). Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep's milk.\n\nMilk composition analysis, per 100 grams:\n\nSheep milk is extremely high in fat and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) compared to other milk producing species. There is also a large amount of solids present in the milk. This makes sheep milk an excellent choice for making cheese and it produces higher yields of cheese compared to other milk producing species. One liter of sheep milk will produce a far higher amount of cheese than one liter of cow milk.\n\n\n"}

This can be compared to the use of borrowed Classical Latin vocabulary in modern Romance languages. Both tadbhavas and tatsamas are also distinguished from deśi (\"local\") words, a term applied to words that have a non-Indo-Aryan source, typically Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, or Tibeto-Burman. In the modern context, the terms \"tadbhava\" and \"tatsama\" are applied to Sanskrit loanwords not only in Indo-Aryan languages, but also in Dravidian, Munda and other South Asian languages.\n\nModern Indo-Aryan languages have two classes of words inherited from Sanskrit. The first covers words which have come to these languages from Old Indo-Aryan through Prakrit and Apabhraṃśa; these are the inherited tadbhava words, showing an unbroken chain of language evolution from Old Indo-Aryan to the modern form. A second class of Sanskrit-derived words in modern Indo-Aryan languages covers words which have their origin in Classical Sanskrit and which were originally borrowed into Prakrit or Apabhraṃśa as tatsamas but which, over the course of time, changed in form to fit the phonology of the recipient language; such words are often called ardhatatsamas or semi-tatsamas by modern linguists. These stand apart from the tatsamas, which are borrowings left relatively unchanged from Sanskrit.\n\nTadbhava, tatsama and semi-tatsama forms derived from the same Indo-Aryan root sometimes coexist in modern Indo-Aryan languages. For example, the reflexes of in Bengali include Sanskrit borrowings in tatsama and semi-tatsama form in addition to the inherited tadbhava form . Similarly, Sanskrit exists in modern Hindi as a semi-tatsama and an inherited tadbhava form (via Prakrit ) in addition to the pure tatsama . In such cases, the use of tatsama forms in place of equivalent tadbhava or native forms is often seen by speakers of a language as a marker of a more chaste or literary form of the language as opposed to a more rustic or colloquial form. Often, however, a word exists only in one of the three possible forms, that is, only as a tadbhava, tatsama or semi-tatsama, or has different meanings in different forms. For example, reflexes of the Old Indo-Aryan word exists in Hindi both as a tatsama and as a tadbhava. However, the tatsama word means \"heart\" as in Sanskrit whereas the tadbhava means \"courage\".\n\nOdia words are divided into native words (\"desaja\"), those borrowed from Sanskrit (\"tatasam\") and those adapted with little modification from Sanskrit (\"tatbhaba\"). The 17th century dictionary \"Gitabhidhana\" by Upendra Bhanja, \"Sabda Tattva Abhidhana\" (1916) by Gopinath Nanda, \"Purnachandra Oriya Bhashakosha\" (1931) by GC Praharaj containing 185000 Words, \"Promoda Abhidan\" (1942) containing 150000 words by PC Deb and \"Damodara Mishar\" classified the Odia words as deśi, tatsama or tadbhava.\n\nThose Odia words are derived from Odia verbal roots, and the Odia verbal roots are derived from Sanskrit verbal roots; these Odia words are called Tatabhaba Krudanta words. For example, \"\"kandana\"\" is derived from Odia \"\"dhatu kanda\"\" which is derived from Sanskrit \"\"kranda dhatu\"\".\n\nIn the context of Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, and Tibeto-Burman languages of South Asia, the terms \"tatsama\" and \"tadbhava\" are used to describe words which have been borrowed from Sanskrit either unmodified (\"tatsama\") or modified (\"tadbhava\"). Tadbhava as used in relation to these languages, therefore, corresponds more accurately with the categories of tatsama and semi-tatsama used in relation to the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages. All Dravidian languages contain a proportion of tadbhava and tatsama words, possibly exceeding over half of the vocabulary of literary Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam, with Tamil being less Sanskritised. Because of their non-Indo-Aryan origin, the native, inherited vocabulary of Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, and Tibeto-Burman languages of South Asia would be classified as \"deśi\".\n\n"}

This is enhanced with rice, chopped pancetta or bacon, cured ham, parsley, garlic, a pinch of cinnamon, salt and white pepper.\n\n\"Chireta\" literally means \"inside out\"—i.e., the sheep's intestines which make up the casings are cleaned and turned inside out for a smoother, more appetizing appearance.\n\nThe casing is cleaned in white vinegar then rinsed very well before filling. The filling contains rice mixed with garlic, parsley and seasoned chopped meats. Casings are filled about a half to two-thirds of the way with the rice mixture, taking care not to overfill them, as the rice will expand once the chiretas are boiled in the broth—otherwise they are likely to burst. Once trussed, and just before cooking, they are also examined to make sure any air pockets are pushed out.\n\nChiretas are usually served hot, as a main dish. However they taste just as good, if not better, when served up as tapas, sliced, dipped in an egg-flour batter, and fried to a golden color.\n\nChiretas can be found on the menu in restaurants of the Ribagorza, and Sobrarbe regions, and can also be sampled as tapas in the wine valley cuisine of the Somontano area.\n\nIn 2002, a Somontano meat packer initiated a chireta festival, which has been running every year since then, around the third weekend of October.

The meat itself does not have to come from the Adour basin but has to be produced from one of eight clearly defined breeds of pig reared in an area from Deux-Sèvres in the north to Aveyron and the Aude. The regulations are very strict and cover the zone of origin of the pork, the regime for feeding the animals (no steroids, no fish oils, no antibiotics), and each animal must be clearly and uniquely identifiable with a tattoo. Transport, slaughter, size and weight of the original meat cut, minimum fat cover, linoleic acid content, and the post slaughter storage temperature for the meat are all specified. The ham produced within these criteria is given the European Union PGI status Protected Designation of Origin (allows nitrite content) and as such is called Bayonne ham. Enforcement of these regulations and the granting of the right to use the name Bayonne ham is the responsibility of Le Consortium de Jambon du Bayonne based in Pau, the capital of Department 64 in southwest France.\n\nThe drying method used in modern times mimics that used in the past. Each drying storage chamber has temperature and humidity controls set to match seasonal variations. Originally the pigs were slaughtered in late October and early November. The hams were then rubbed in salt produced in the salt pans of the Adour estuary or from those near Béarn. The temperature conditions at this time of year, , are ideal for the initial preserving process and the hams were left hanging in the drying room until the end of January or early February. In the next part of the process, a mixture of pork fat and flour called \"pannage\" is used to seal the cut end of the joint. This reduces the speed in which the meat dries out during the warmer months of March, April, and May. At some point during this time many of the producers will also rub a paste of \"piment d'Espelette\" into the skin, giving a unique tang to the end product. The final drying stage is completed by the end of July and the ham is ready. Modern techniques using individual drying chambers with temperature and humidity controls simply reproduce the seasonal temperatures and the changing humidity conditions produced each year by the foehn (southerly wind) and the Atlantic ocean. The size of ham used is normally within the range of including bone.\n\nOnce the ham has completed its curing process, it is marked with the traditional Basque cross or lauburu, topped with the name Bayonne. The ham is a minimum of 7 months old, with most being 9 or 10 months before it is offered for sale, and it will keep for up to another year if kept in a cool (8 °C), dry atmosphere.\n\nThe ham is a slightly sweet, delicately flavoured meat with little salt to the taste. It is generally cut very thin and has a chewy texture in comparison to cooked hams.\n\n\n"}

In other parts of the Philippines, Caviteño \"kesilyo\" or \"kasilyo\" and Cebuano \"queseo\" or \"kiseyo\", are all nativized spellings of Spanish \"quesillo\" (\"little cheese\").\n\nMost \"kesong puti\" is made by direct acidification, similar to numerous other cheeses like queso blanco, paneer, ricotta, mascarpone, and cottage cheese. It is usually made with carabao milk, but it can also use goat or cow milk, though the latter has lower yields.\n\nThe most common way of making homemade \"kesong puti\" is by heating (but not boiling) fresh strained carabao milk with one to four teaspoons of salt for about ten to fifteen minutes while stirring constantly. The ideal temperature is around , as long as it does not reach and above. Higher temperatures will denature the proteins, resulting in slower or even no curdling. This also pasteurizes the milk, destroying pathogens and allowing the cheese to last longer. Around a fourth of a cup of vinegar or citrus juices (or both) are then added to induce coagulation. It is left to curdle for around 30 minutes to an hour. The curds are strained with a cheesecloth (\"katsa\") leaving the soft gelatinous-like version of \"kesong puti\". It can be further pressed and molded to squeeze out more whey if desired. In commercial versions, the salt is usually added after the curdling either through manual mixing or by soaking the cheese in weak brine solutions.\n\nAn alternate way of making \"kesong puti\" is with rennet dissolved in a small amount of water. The rennet can either be vegetable-based or from ruminant stomachs. The steps are similar to the vinegar or citrus method but requires that the milk be cooled after it is taken off the heat, ideally to . This is because rennet is deactivated at higher temperatures, while lower temperatures result in slow or no coagulation. Like in the previous method, it is left to coagulate for 30 minutes to an hour. The curds are strained then cut into small cubes and left to stand for another 15 minutes to allow more moisture to seep out. This method results in more curds and a firmer type of cheese once pressed. It is the method used by the Philippine Carabao Center \"kesong puti\".\n\n\"Kesong puti\" made with rennet is similar to the Italian mozzarella di bufala. It lacks the sour vinegary smell that usually characterizes the vinegar or citrus versions.\n\n\"Kesong puti\" is usually sold wrapped in banana leaves. It has a mildly salty and tart flavor and ideally has little or no odor. It can be eaten as is, either fresh or grilled on a pan. It is also commonly eaten with bread or \"kakanin\" rice cakes, including pandesal, \"puto\", and \"bibingka\", It can also be used in various dishes in Filipino cuisine; including dishes like \"paella negra\" and \"ginataang pakô\".\n\n\"Kesong puti\" has a shelf life of only around a week. It depends on the amount of salt used as well as the consistency of the cheese. Softer cheese spoil faster than firmer versions. It can be extended to about two weeks to a month if packaged correctly and refrigerated. However, it should never be frozen as it will form ice crystals that damage the smooth texture.\n\nThere are four main regions producing variants of \"kesong puti\" that probably originated independently: Laguna, Cebu, Cavite, and Bulacan. The following are the most prevalent production techniques for commercial \"kesong puti\" among the regions:\n\nLaguna \"kesong puti\" or \"quesong puti\" is originally from Santa Cruz, Laguna. Its production is centered in the towns of Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, and Lumban, with the milk used coming from neighboring towns (mostly from Lumban and Jalajala). Laguna \"kesong puti\" traditionally use rennet from carabao or cow abomasum. It undergoes lactic acid fermentation during the process. The salt is added afterwards and mixed by hand until the texture becomes smooth. It is similar to the Cebu version and is firmer than the Cavite and Bulacan version. Santa Cruz celebrates an annual Kesong Puti Festival.\n\nCebuano \"queseo\" or \"kiseyo\" production is centered on the town of Compostela and the city of Danao. It is very similar to the Laguna version and is made using the same processes. It differs only in that \"queseo\" typically use more salt and the molds are lined with muslin cloth. The muslin cloth may be pressed with a weight. It is a fermented cheese and is also usually firm, like the Laguna version. The town of Compostela celebrates an annual Queseo Festival.\n\nCaviteño \"quesillo\", \"kesilyo\", or \"kasilyo\" production is centered in the cities of General Trias, Cavite, and Tanza. It uses vinegar as the coagulant. It is not a fermented cheese, unlike the Laguna and Cebu versions. Salt is added to the milk beforehand. A small amount of vinegar is then heated to around in a small clay pot (\"palayok\") and the milk added and stirred until curds form. The curds are strained and molded in small cups and then further soaked in a weak brine solution. The resulting cheese has a softer consistency in comparison to the Laguna and Cebu versions.\n\nBulacan \"kesong puti\" production is centered in the towns of Santa Maria, Meycauayan, and San Miguel. It is similar to the Caviteño version in that it is not a fermented cheese and primarily use vinegar. It differs in that more vinegar is used and it is not heated while curdling. The curds are molded and then soaked in a weak brine solution.\n\n"}

It is currently owned by Perio, Inc.\n\nMIT Professor Frank Shields set out to create a product that would provide for a less irritating shave. In 1919, he succeeded with the invention of Barbasol – a shaving cream that did not have to be worked into a lather. The original formula was a thick lotion and is most closely related to the modern Barbasol Non-Aerosol Therapeutic Shave Cream.\n\nBarbasol was first manufactured under the Napco Corporation name, a company Frank Shields started before inventing Barbasol. After the shaving cream sales increased, they outgrew Napco and The Barbasol Company was created.\n\nFrank Shields established The Barbasol Company in 1920, which owned the brand for 42 years. In the mid-1950s, design engineer Robert P. Kaplan of Rochester, NY invented and patented the first aerosol shaving cream can, and the Barbasol Company changed the formula from the thick cream in a tube to the soft, fluffy foam familiar in the aerosol cans today. The can design mimicked a barber's pole, and is still the trademark design used today.\n\nIn 1962, Pfizer bought The Barbasol Company and brought Barbasol in the portfolio. During this time, they developed many additional versions of Barbasol to complement the original formulation, including Soothing Aloe, Skin Conditioner, Sensitive Skin, Extra Protection, Cool Menthol and Lemon Lime.\n\nAs gels became popular, Pfizer created gel versions of Barbasol in the Original, Soothing Aloe, Sensitive Skin, and Extra Protection varieties.\n\nIn the 1980s, Pfizer made Barbasol Glide Stick, a deodorant.\n\nBy the 1990s, Barbasol brand equity had diminished. Sales had slowed. Pfizer, primarily a pharmaceutical company, looked to sell the brand.\n\nPerio bought the Barbasol brand from Pfizer in 2001 and has since been attempting to revitalize it.\n\nPerio consolidated the Barbasol line to Original, Soothing Aloe, and Skin Conditioner, and added Pacific Rush.\n\nA non-aerosol cream that simulated the original product was created in 2003, but was reformulated to the Barbasol Non-Aerosol Therapeutic Shave Cream in 2006 (Pfizer also had a similar simulation of the original Barbasol cream, but discontinued it in 1999).\n\nRecently, Barbasol released Sensitive Skin, Mountain Blast (a new fragrance), and Arctic Chill (menthol) to its line of shaving creams. Several aftershave products have also been introduced under the Barbasol brand name. More recently, Barbasol has introduced disposable razors in twin-blade, three-blade, and six-blade versions.\n\nBarbasol's market share continues to grow, with one in four men now using it.\n\nPerio is based in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nBarbasol became a very popular shaving cream after its introduction. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, many print advertisements were used to support its growth. Many of the print ads featured men and women in situations that would be considered risqué for their time.\n\nThe company also used several famous spokesmen throughout the years, including actor Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., star baseball players Babe Ruth and Rogers Hornsby, as well as football legend Knute Rockne.\n\nIn 1938, Barbasol sponsored a car in the Indianapolis 500, and painted it to look like a tube of the cream. Driven by George Bailey, the car made it to lap 166 of 200 before suffering clutch problems. The following year, the Barbasol car finished in tenth place. The team got involved as a sponsor in the NASCAR Busch Series in the late 1990s, sponsoring Dick Bown's team and drivers Chuck and Jim Bown, Jim Sauter, and Greg Biffle in eleven races in 1996, then going to Akins Motorsports and drivers Glenn Allen, Jr. and Elton Sawyer starting in 1997.\n\nThe tagline throughout this time was \"No brush, no lather, no rub in.\"\n\nOne of the most nostalgic figures in Barbasol's history was Singin' Sam the Barbasol Man, whose real name was Harry Frankel.\n\nFrankel got his start as a vaudevillian, and eventually became the spokesperson for a lawnmower company and began broadcasting out of Cincinnati. The Barbasol Company soon heard him and, in 1931, signed him on as Singin' Sam the Barbasol Man, where he made famous the Barbasol jingle, \"Barbasol, Barbasol ... No brush, no lather, no rub-in ... Wet your razor, then begin.\"\n\nBarbasol's recent advertising is hardly as suggestive as its 1920s counterparts. Many television ads from 2001 to 2009 have featured a close-call situation, followed by one person saying \"Close shave!\" and another person responding with \"Better buy Barbasol!\"\n\nRecently, the \"close shave\" double entendre has been replaced with the more patriotic tagline \"Close Shave America, Close Shave Barbasol.\" (This can be heard, for example, on the Fred Thompson Show radio podcast). The related advertising relies less on tongue-in-cheek humor and associates the brand more with a warm, homey feeling.\n\nIn February 2012, Barbasol signed a five-year agreement with Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew that would see the brand become the club's shirt sponsor.\n\nBarbasol is a main sponsor of radio network Westwood One, with its radio commercials (most of which featured former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason) being heard during sporting events broadcast on Westwood One.\n\nThe Barbasol Championship is a professional golf tournament scheduled that was played for the first time on the PGA Tour in 2015 as an alternative event for the 2015 Open Championship. The tournament is played on the Grand National course of the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail in Opelika, Alabama\n\nBarbasol has recently begun to create a distinct social media presence, including Twitter-based sweepstakes.\n\nGiven the 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\" features an embryo cryopreservation container hidden in a modified Barbasol can, the brand was used to market the 2015 sequel \"Jurassic World\". Special dinosaur-themed cans were released, along with a promotion offering a trip to an archaeological excavation in Wyoming.\n\nBarbasol's longevity in the American marketplace has made it an unmistakable icon for shaving. It is often the representative for a can of shaving cream, simply for its recognizable packaging, and can be seen in such movies as \"Jurassic Park\", \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\", and \"Evan Almighty\".\n\nBarbasol is distributed throughout North America.\n"}

During a Jewish fast, no food or drink is consumed, including bread and water. The major fasts last over 25 hours, from before sundown on the previous night until after sundown on the day of the fast. Four other shorter fasts during the year begin at dawn and end after sunset. In Islam fasting mostly occurs during the month of \"Ramadan\" where Muslims fast for the whole duration of the month for around 30 continuous days. The fasting starts at dawn and ends by sunset where the first meal \"break fast\" is eaten. During the time of fast no form of food and drinks are consumed.\n\nA break-fast follows each of the major Jewish fast days of Yom Kippur and Tisha B'Av, as well as the four minor fast days of Fast of Gedalia, Fast of Esther, Tenth of Tevet, and Seventeenth of Tammuz.\n\nSometimes the fast is broken with tea and cake before eating a full meal. A drink of milk or juice before the post-fast meal helps the body to readjust and diminishes the urge to eat too much or too rapidly.\n\nCustoms for the first food eaten after the Yom Kippur fast differ. Iranian Jews often eat a mixture of shredded apples mixed with rose water called \"faloodeh seeb.\" Polish and Russian Jews will have tea and cake. Syrian and Iraqi Jews eat round sesame crackers that look like mini-bagels. Turkish and Greek Jews sip a sweet drink made from melon seeds. Some people start with herring to replace the salt lost during fasting. North African Jews prepare butter cookies known as rhuraieba (\"ribo\" among Moroccan Jews) for the meal after the Yom Kippur fast.\n\nOrthodox Jews generally do not eat meat or drink wine at the break-fast after Tisha B'Av because the burning of the Temple on the 9th of Av is said to have continued until noon on the 10th of Av. Even when the 9th of Av falls and Shabbat and Tisha B'Av is observed on the 10th, though all other Nine Days restrictions end with the fast, wine and meat are customarily still not consumed at the break fast.\n\n"}

In urban areas, deels are mostly only worn by elderly people, or on festive occasions. The deel appears similar to a caftan or an old European folded tunic. Deels typically reach to below the wearer's knees and fan out at the bottom and are commonly blue, olive, or burgundy, though there are deels in a variety of other colors.\n\nThe deel looks like a large overcoat when not worn. Instead of buttoning together in the middle, the sides are pulled against the wearer's body, the right flap close to the body with the left covering. On the right side of the wearer are typically 5 or 6 clasps to hold the top flap in place. There is one clasp below the armpit, three at the shoulder, and either one or two at the neckline.\n\nA deel is traditionally worn with a large sash, usually made of silk but leather belts with large, ornate buckles have become more common in the modern era. The area between the flaps and above the belt creates a large pocket in which Mongolians keep many things, Mongolian men will occasionally even carry silver bowl or cup, snuff box in their deel. Though there is no major difference in material or outline between male and female deels, females tend to wear the \"pocket\" closer (that is, women often prefer a more snug-fitting deel), while males' may have both larger pockets, looser fit, and wider sleeves.\n\nIn Mongolia, the usage of the word deel has been extended to cover other long winter coats as well. For example, fur and leather overcoats of western design are referred to as \"\"nekhii deel\"\" and \"\"sawkhin deel\"\", respectively, meaning \"fur deel\", \"leather deel\" and \"cashmere deel\", which is made of the luxurious material cashmere. Nevertheless, other Mongol regions, such as Bortala in Xinjiang retain the specific meaning of the word \"deel\" as the traditional garment, and refer to other overcoats as \"\"olondoi\"\".\n\nDeel design varies among cultures, ethnic groups and time periods to a certain degree. There are even distinct variations among different Mongol tribes mostly on the design of the upper chest opening edges. For instance the Khalkha Mongol deel opening edges are round while a Buryat deel's is square. It can also vary among other tribes such as Chakhar, Torguud, and Uzemchin. Deels are designed for different occasions and environments. The design also varies due to function. There are deels for ceremonies like weddings and holidays and deels for daily wear. Deels for special occasions have their outer layer made of silk while the common deels are usually made of wool, cotton and other relatively inexpensive materials.\n\n"}

For the similar-sounding computer programme, see Applet\"\nAplets & Cotlets is a lokum-type confection associated with the U.S. state of Washington. The candy is similar to Turkish Delight and was first developed in 1918 by apple farmers as a way to dispose of surplus crops. A 2009 effort to legally designate Aplets & Cotlets as Washington's official candy failed due to provincial competition between legislators from the state's two geo-cultural regions.\n\nAplets & Cotlets are small, gelatin-like confections baked in powdered-sugar around walnuts. They are similar in taste and consistency to Turkish Delight, on which they are based, but the pectin in the fruit acts as a gelling agent. Aplets are made with apples and Cotlets are made with apricots.\n\nApples have traditionally been the most important cash crop in Washington. By the 1920s, the state had become the leading producer of the fruit in the United States. In 2003, Washington produced more apples than the rest of the United States combined. In the early 20th century Armenian immigrants Armen Tertsagian and Mark Balaban, proprietors of an apple orchard in Cashmere, Washington, began producing Aplets as a way of disposing of their surplus crop; the idea for the candy came from their faint recollections of eating Turkish delight as children. Aplets were followed, several years later, with Cotlets. The candies were originally sold at a roadside fruit stand but gained greater attention in 1962 as a result of the Seattle World's Fair.\n\nManufactured versions of the candy are limited to those produced by Liberty Orchards of Cashmere, Tertsagian and Balaban's original company. According to the firm, there is \"not a huge market\" for the product outside Washington, though in the late 1990s the company began limited retailing at national chain stores such as Target (the bulk of Aplet & Cotlet sales prior to this had been in local retailers like Frederick & Nelson, Bartell Drugs, and Pay 'n Save, and through its mail-order catalog). Despite their obscurity nationally, they are available at many farmstead style shops west of the Rocky Mountains. Recipes for homemade versions also exist.\n\nIn 2009, members of the Washington State Legislature attempted to designate Aplets & Cotlets the \"official candy of the state of Washington\". The measure faced opposition from some who felt Almond Roca or Mountain Bar should receive the honor instead. In its report on the measure, the House of Representatives' Committee on Government and Tribal Affairs claimed that designating the candy as the state's official candy would help strengthen unity between the state's two geo-cultural regions, explaining that Aplets & Cotlets \"represents the goal of one Washington – Eastern Washington where much of the fruit is grown and Western Washington where products use transportation links to get to market\". The bill ultimately failed to pass in 2009 and after a re-introduction in 2010.\n"}

It is a ring of yeast-leavened wheat dough, that has been boiled in water for a short time before baking.\n\nA class of such ring-shaped rolls is common for Eastern European cuisines. Ukrainian bublik is similar to an Ashkenazi Jewish bagel, but somewhat bigger and has a wider hole. Bubliks usually have a denser and \"chewier\" texture than bagels. Russian baranka (; pl. \"baranki\") is a dough ring somewhat smaller than a bublik, but also thinner and drier. Sushka (; pl. \"sushki\") is an even smaller and drier type, generally about 5 cm in size, and has the consistency of a hard cracker.\n\nIn Russian and Ukrainian, \"bublik\" is often used as a generic designation for any ring-shaped product of this type. In Russian, \"baranka\" is also used as a similar generic term, whereas \"baranka-type products\" () is a formal designation of the product class. A cognate term \"obarinok\" (обарінок) or \"obvarinok\" (обварінок) is sometimes used as a sinonym for bublik or baranka in Ukrainian. Bublik or baranka is known as \"abaranak\" () in Belarusian and or in Lithuanian.\n\nPolish \"obwarzanek\" is done with the same technology as bublik or baranka, but its most common form, obwarzanek krakowski, has a braided ring shape.\n\n\"Bublik\" stems from Old East Slavic бубьлъ (\"bubl\"), ultimately from Proto-Slavic \"*bǫbьlь\", from which Polish \"bąbel\", Czech \"boubel\" and Slovak \"bublina\" also originated. All these words mean \"bubble\".\n\nRussian \"baranka\" or \"baranok\" is a contraction of the word \"obvaranok\" (обваранок), \"scalded\" / \"parboiled\". Belarusian \"abaranak\", Ukrainian \"ob[v]arinok\" and Polish \"obwarzanek\" share the same etymology. The Russian spelling suggests that the word was adopted into Russian from Belarusian.\n\nThe first known written mention of the \"bagel\" is found in the \"Community Regulations\" of the city of Kraków in 1610. The bagel spread through Poland across all areas with significant Jewish population, reaching Ukraine, where it got its current form. The word \"bublik\" was adopted from Ukrainian to Russian in which it is first documented in the 18th century. It is mentioned as \"wheat bublik\" (бублик пшеничнои) in the \"Lexicon or Alphabetic Collection of Speeches from Russian to Dutch\" by Jacob Bruce published in 1717 in Saint Petersburg.\nThe \"baranka\" is first mentioned in Russian sources in a 17th century text. An entry for the year 1665 in the accound ledger of Valday Iversky Monastery reads: \"Baranki and eggs purchased for the brothers in Bogoroditsino village for ten altyn.\" In the 19th century, the town of Valday was famous for its baranki. Valday baranki were mentioned by Alexander Pushkin, Alexander Radishchev and others.\n\nWilliam Pokhlyobkin traces the origin of Russian baranka to what is now Belarus, in particular to the town of Smarhon’ (the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania). Until the beginning of the 20th century, most of Smarhon' population was Jewish. Baranki were supposedly used to feed bears in the local school of bear training (the so called \"Bear Academy\"). Written accounts of Smarhon' baranki appeared in the 19th century. Adam Kirkor wrote in the encyclopedia \"Picturesque Russia\": \"In Smorgon', Oshmyany district, Vilna province, almost all the petty bourgeois population is busy baking small bubliki, or kringles, which are widely known as \"Smorgon' obvaranki\". Each traveller would definitely buy several bundles of these bubliki; besides, they are transported to Vilna and other cities.\" Władysław Syrokomla mentioned Smarhon' as \"the capital of obwarzanki famous in all Lithuania\". Smarhon' obwarzanki were a traditional treat at Saint Casimir's Fair in Vilnius.\n\nBubliks are made from yeast-leavened wheat dough that commonly contains milk, butter, and egg whites and is rather sweet. Poppy seeds are a popular addition to the dough, as well as several other fillings. For savory bubliks, sugar is omitted and instead grated cheese and a few drops of onion juice can be added.\nBubliks are featured by professional bakers in their shops and at country fairs and regional markets. They are usually strung on a string by the dozen.\n\nIn Belarus, Russia and Ukraine bubliks and barankas are usually treated not like bread, but like a type of pastry, eaten as a complement to tea or coffee. Therefore, bublik dough is generally sweeter and denser than that of bagel dough, and they are usually glazed with egg yolk. By far the most popular variety of bublik has a liberal amount of poppy seeds added to it.\n\nBubliks are usually eaten as is, but it is not uncommon to dip them into tea, a practice that came from eating sushki and baranki, which were very similar in taste, but rather dry and hard and not easily palatable unless moisturized.\n\nAnother common way of eating bubliks is to break them into several fragments and to eat them with jam (varenye), sour cream (smetana), or other similar dips. While they often accompany tea, bubliks, again unlike modern bagels, are rarely considered a breakfast food.\n\nA short poem called \"Protoptala stezhku cherez yar\" (\"I beat a path through the ravine\") in \"Kobzar\" book by Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko refers to a young woman who sells bubliki at the market to the Cossacks.\n\n\"Bublitchki\", a diminutive of bubliki, is a title of a famous Yiddish-Ukrainian-Russian song written in Odessa in the 1920s. Leonid Utyosov popularised the song in the USSR. The Barry Sisters together with the Ziggy Elman Orchestra made it popular in the US in 1939. Today it belongs to the repertoire of klezmer, jazz and pop musicians.\n\nA common Russian and Ukrainian phrase is \"a hole from a bublik\" (, ) - which means \"absolutely nothing\" or \"worthless\". Examples:\nThis expression in literature is found in Mystery-Bouffe, a socialist dramatic play written by Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1918/1921:\n\nThe word \"Bublik\" is also a Ukrainian-language surname, found mostly in Ukraine and Southern Russia.\n\n"}

This article will mimic the magic hypercubes article in close detail, and just as that article serves merely as an introduction to the topic.\n\nIt is customary to denote the dimension with the letter 'n' and the orders of a hyperbeam with the letter 'm' (appended with the subscripted number of the direction it applies to).\n\nFurther: In this article the analytical number range [0..∏m-1] is being used.\n\nin order to keep things in hand a special notation was developed:\n\nNote: The notation for position can also be used for the value on that position.

The inquest, as a means of settling a fact, had developed in Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire while Anglo-Saxon law had used a \"jury of accusation\" to establish the strength of the allegation against a criminal suspect. In the latter case, the jury were not triers of fact and, if the accusation was seen as posing a case to answer, guilt or innocence were established by oath, often in the form of compurgation, or trial by ordeal. During the 11th and 12th centuries, juries were sworn to decide property disputes but it was the Roman Catholic Church's 1215 withdrawal of support for trial by ordeal that necessitated the development of the jury in its modern form.\n\nThe jury had always been a socially exclusive institution, and historically people had to own land of a particular value in order to qualify. Until 1919, women were automatically disqualified from serving on trial juries, and even after this date local prejudices had the effect of keeping women off the jury. The fact few women satisfied the property qualifications until they were abolished in the 1970s also served to heavily restrict the number of women eligible for jury service.\n\nJuries are summoned for criminal trials in the Crown Court where the offence is an indictable offence or an offence triable either way that has been sent to the Crown Court after examination by magistrates. Magistrates have the power to send any offence triable either way to the Crown Court but, even if they elect to try the case themselves, the accused retains the right to elect for a Crown Court trial with a jury. Summary offences are tried by magistrates and there is no right of Crown Court trial by jury. During the 21st century some exceptions to jury trial in the Crown Court have been developed.\n\nCrown Court trial without a jury is permitted in cases of suspected jury tampering where there is evidence of a \"real and present danger\" and, despite the possibility of police protection, there is a substantial likelihood of tampering, and a trial without a jury is in the interests of justice. The first such prosecution application was made in February 2008. The first criminal trial in a crown court without a jury was approved in 2009.\n\nThere are also provisions under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, ss.17–20 to try defendants accused of domestic violence on sample counts and, on conviction, for the remainder of the counts to be tried by a judge alone. These provisions came into force on 8 January 2007.\n\nIf the defendant pleads \"autrefois\", the judge now decides the matter without a jury.\n\nBetween 1973 and 2007 trials in Northern Ireland could be held without a jury in special courts known as Diplock courts.\n\nA senior coroner must hear an inquest without a jury unless the senior coroner has reason to suspect that the death occurred in custody or otherwise in state detention and that either the cause of death was a violent or unnatural one or the cause of death is unknown; or the death resulted from the act or omission of a police officer or a member of a service police force, in the purported execution of the officer's or member's duty as such; or that the death was caused by a notifiable accident, poisoning or disease, as defined in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. An inquest into a death may be held with a jury if the senior coroner thinks that there is sufficient reason for doing so. \n\nAll common law civil cases were tried by jury up to the introduction of juryless trials in the new county courts in 1846. The perceived success of this system, together with increasing recognition of the integrity of judges and the professionalisation of legal institutions, meant that, when the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 gave litigants in the Queen's Bench the option of trial by judge alone, there was a steady uptake. Over the next eighty years, the use of juries in civil trials steadily declined.\n\nIn 1933 the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933, s.6 guaranteed the right of jury trial in the Queen's Bench Division for:\n\n\nThe 1933 Act also provided that: \"but, save as aforesaid, any action to be tried in that Division may, in the discretion of the court or a judge, be ordered to be tried either with or without a jury.\" The Act brought a \"de facto\" end to civil jury trials in England and Wales save for the causes where the right was guaranteed.\n\nIn \"Ward v James\", Lord Denning, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that personal injury cases were unsuitable for jury trials owing to the technical expertise and experience needed in assessing damages. In \"Singh v. London Underground Ltd\" (1990), a litigant sought a jury trial on a case arising from the King's Cross fire but was refused owing to the technical nature of the case. In 1993, in Rantzen v Mirror Group Newspapers (1986) Ltd and others it was held that judges could substitute awards by juries in civil cases on appeal if they are deemed to be excessive. In 1998 less than 1% of civil trials in England and Wales were jury trials and these were principally defamation cases.\n\nSection 69 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, which replaced section 6 of the 1933 Act in respect of High Court trials, provides that trial shall be by jury on the application of a party where the court is satisfied that there is in issue:\nunless the court is of the opinion that the trial requires any prolonged examination of documents or accounts or any scientific or local investigation which cannot conveniently be made with a jury.\n\nLibel and slander were removed from section 69 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 by section 11 of the Defamation Act 2013, meaning that defamation claims made on or after 1 January 2014 are heard without a jury unless the judge orders otherwise.\n\nSince 1925 a jury has been able to continue hearing a case after a member has died or been discharged. Now the trial can continue so long as the minimum number of jurors remain. The judge should press the jury for a unanimous verdict. In the Crown Court the judge must not, in any event, suggest that a majority is acceptable until after 2 hours and 10 minutes. This was originally 2 hours but it was extended to allow time for the jury to settle after retiring. Unanimous verdicts were required until the Criminal Justice Act 1967.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) Act 1939 authorised trials with only 7 jurors, except for treason or murder.\n\nA jury panel is summoned from those who meet all of the following criteria:\n\nThose who are liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 or who lack mental capacity are disqualified.\n\nPersons currently on bail are disqualified. Persons are disqualified for life if they have been sentenced to:\n\nPersons are disqualified for 10 years after:\nPersons \"not capable of acting effectively as a juror\" may be discharged by the judge.\n\nPeople are excused from jury service if:\n\n\nJurors are called by a written summons from the Lord Chancellor, despite the recent reform of that office, executed in practice by a local court officer. A panel of jurors is summoned, having regard to the convenience of the jurors though there are no absolute geographical constraints. There are facilities for the parties to inspect the panel and for individual members to be examined by the judge if there are doubts about their fitness to serve because of lack of proficiency in English or because of physical disability, for example deafness.\n\nIf there are not enough jurors on the panel then any person in the vicinity of the court can be summoned to make up the numbers, a process known as \"praying a tales\". Jurors so summoned are called talesmen. This rare procedure was used at Salisbury Crown Court in June 2016 after the judge noticed that he was three jurors short, leaving the court clerk and usher to look for people to join the jury. Two people declined to take up the jury service, but eventually \"the judge’s strategy paid off and the trial was able to go ahead after one passer-by was recruited from the street and two other jurors were transferred from Winchester.\"\n\nA jury in waiting, of twenty or more jurors is selected from the panel by the clerk of the court.\n\nThe clerk then calls the name of 12 of them at random, usually by drawing from a shuffled pack of cards with the names written on them. As each name is called, the juror steps into the jury box. Once the jury box is populated with 12 jurors, the clerk says to the defendant:\n\nThe clerk then calls each juror individually to either affirm or to take the oath, reading from a printed card whilst, if taking an oath, holding a holy book in his right hand (New Testament for those Christians who will swear an oath; Old Testament for Jews; or Qur'an for Muslims). Some Christians (notably Quakers, Moravians and Jehovah's Witnesses) will not take an oath because they believe it is prohibited by Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12. The right of Quakers and Moravians to affirm, rather than swear, when joining a jury was introduced under the Quakers and Moravians Act 1833, and later extended to those who were formerly Quakers or formerly Moravians under the Quakers and Moravians Act 1838. Since then the right to affirm has been extended to anyone who chooses to do so, and no reason for choosing to affirm has to be given. The option to affirm is now commonly used by Quakers, Moravians, Jehovah's Witnesses, and some other Christians as well as by atheists and agnostics. Under the Oaths Act 1978, all affirmations are given in the format \"I, do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm...\"\n\nUnder some circumstances a juror can be challenged, and may not serve. This must be done before the oath is taken, and on limited grounds.\n\nPeremptory challenges, or challenges without cause, allowing the defence to prevent a certain number of jurors from serving without giving any reason, were formerly allowed in English courts and are still allowed in some other jurisdictions. At one time, the defence was allowed 25 such challenges, but this was reduced to 12 in 1925, to 7 in 1948 and 3 in 1977 before total abolition in 1988.\n\nThe prosecution and judge, but not the defence, have the right to prevent a juror from serving by asking them to \"stand by\". However, prosecutors are instructed to invoke this right sparingly as the quality of the jury is primarily the responsibility of the court officer. The right should only be invoked in cases of national security or terrorism, in which case the personal authority of the Attorney General is needed, or where a juror is \"obviously unsuitable\", and the defence agree.\n\nEither prosecution or defence can \"challenge for cause\" as many individual jurors as they wish on the grounds that the juror is:\n\nThese are the modern versions of the ancient challenges of \"propter honoris respectum\", \"propter defectum\" and \"propter affectum\". Challenges have been successful where a juror was employed by or related to a party, had enjoyed entertainment at a party's home, or where they had already expressed an opinion on the case or shown hostility to the accused. During the 1969 trial of the notorious gangsters, the Kray twins, the trial judge was prepared to exclude any juror who had read some of the current lurid newspaper reporting. However, in a trial arising from the conduct of a picket in the bitterly contested UK miners' strike (1984–1985), a miner who had worked throughout the conflict was held to be fit to serve.\n\nIt is possible to challenge the whole jury panel on the grounds that the court official who selected them was biased but such a challenge is \"virtually unknown in modern times.\"\n\nChecking the criminal records of the jury panel by the police is only permitted on the authority of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and only if:\n\nChecks beyond criminal records may only be made if authorised by the Attorney General and there are adequate grounds for a prosecution request to stand by.\n\nDuring a trial, an individual juror can be discharged and the trial can continue so long as the minimum number of jurors remain. Discharge is at the discretion of the judge and should be exercised in cases of \"evident necessity\".\n\nThe test was given in \"Porter v Magill\" as \"Would a fair-minded and informed observer conclude that there was a real possibility, or real danger (the two being the same) that the tribunal was biased?\"\n\nWhere misconduct cannot be dealt with by discharge of an individual juror, or in the case of jury tampering, or where the jury cannot reach a verdict, the entire jury can be discharged. Inadvertent inadmissible evidence that may prejudice the jury will not inevitably lead to discharge of the jury; the matter lies at the discretion of the judge, who may conclude that the rights of the defendant can be adequately protected by his directing the jury to ignore such evidence.\n\nOnce the jury is sworn, it is customary, but not mandatory, for the clerk to say:\n\nOnce all the prosecution evidence has been given, the jury may at any time, of its own motion, decide to acquit the defendant. Few juries will realise that they have this power unless advised by the judge. Such judicial intervention is deprecated by the Court of Appeal and, as of 2007, is rarely exercised.\n\nAfter the judge has summed up the case, the court usher swears to keep the jury in some \"private and convenient place\", to prevent them from speaking to anyone else and not to speak to them himself \"except it be to ask them if they are agreed upon their verdict.\" The usher then becomes the jury bailiff, and stations himself outside the jury room during the deliberations. The jury may send a note to the judge to ask a question of law or for the judge to read to them a transcript of some of the evidence. It is a contempt of court for a juror to disclose, or for anyone else (including the press) to enquire into, the nature of the jury's deliberations. This is an effective bar on jury research in England and Wales, and on appeals on the basis of the jury's method of reaching its decision.\n\nThe jury may return a verdict of:\n\n\n\n"}

All the variations were based on a waltz composed by Anton Diabelli, who also published the work. It was this same invitation from Diabelli to write a variation that inspired Ludwig van Beethoven to write his 33 \"Diabelli Variations\", Op. 120, which formed the entirety of Part I of \"Vaterländische Künstlerverein\".\n\nThis is Franz Liszt's first known and published work. He might have composed it at the instigation of Carl Czerny, his piano teacher, who also composed a variation and a coda for the set. Liszt was virtually unknown at the time of publishing and he was listed as \"Franz Liszt (Knabe von 11 Jahren) geboren in Ungarn\" (11-year-old boy, born in Hungary). At the time Diabelli issued his invitations to write the variations (May 1819), Liszt was aged only seven, but by the time of publication, he had turned 12. He was the only child composer to write a variation for the set.\n\nThe variation is written in C minor, in time, in the form of an étude. It keeps to the original theme, \"in a flowing style of chord passages in an abundance of notes but without any lofty sentiment\" in the words of Liszt's biographer Lina Ramann. \n\nLiszt was one of the few of the 50 composers who varied either the time signature or the key signature from Diabelli's original.

Nonetheless, one can find masgûf all over Iraq, especially near the Tigris-Euphrates Basin.\n\nOutside of Iraq, masguf is more or less popular in the Al Jazira as in the rural parts of Syria, especially in the regions bordering Iraq, such as in the Raqqa Governorate, which is crossed by the Euphrates. It is also seen, at a lesser scale, in the Jazira areas located in Turkey, such as Nusaybin and Cizre, on the Iraqi border.\n\nMasguf is now also found in Damascus due to a high number of Iraqis exiles living there since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the district of Jeremana alone, where most Iraqis live, more than ten masgûf restaurants, staffed by Iraqis. The fish is brought daily from the Syrian Euphrates to these restaurants, and is kept alive in a fishpond or a big aquarium until it is ordered.\n\nThe fish is caught alive and weighed. It is clubbed to kill it, then split lengthwise down the belly, cleaned and spread out into a single flat piece. It is then partially scaled, gutted and cut in two identical halves from the back while leaving the belly intact, opening the fish in the shape of a large, symmetrical circle. From there, the cook bastes the inside of the fish with a marinade of olive oil, rock salt, tamarind, and ground turmeric.\n\nThe fish is then either impaled on two sharp piles of wood, or placed in a big cast iron grill with a handle and a locking snare, designed specifically for this dish.\n\nThe fish, together with the grill or the piles, is then placed near the fire of the \"fire altar\", a feature shared by all masgûf restaurants. This \"altar\" typically consists of a big open-air area centered by a raised, podium-like sandbox that is either round, octagonal or sometimes rectangular, in the middle of which there is a large fire of apricot tree logs.\n\nCooking typically takes between one and three hours, until most of the fish's fat is burned off, during which time the guests will pick at their mezes.\n\nWhen the fish is well cooked and crispy on the outside, it is typically laid on a large tray garnished with lime (or lemon), slices of onion and Iraqi pickles. Sometimes, in Baghdad, a little mango chutney is also spread on the inside. The tray is then covered by a large crispy flatbread straight of a clay oven to keep its contents hot until served to the client.\n\nThe Turkmens of Northern Iraq are known to prepare a similar recipe, often using a clay oven.\n\n\nMasguf arguably being the most famous dish of Iraq, it is also the one that is always the foremost served to foreign delegations visiting the country by the Iraqi statesmen.\nTwo notable admirers of this dish are said to be the former President of France, Jacques Chirac and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the former chairman of the Russian Duma. Chirac apparently fell for masgûf during a visit to Iraq in a formal dinner given to his honor by Saddam Hussein.\n"}
{"id": "13383318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13383318", "title": "Sope", "text": "Sope\n\nA sope (), also known as \"picadita\" (in Tierra Caliente, Guerrero) is a traditional Mexican dish originating in the central and southern parts of Mexico, where it was sometimes first known as \"pellizcadas\". It is an \"antojito\", which at first sight looks like an unusually thick tortilla with vegetables and meat toppings. The base is made from a circle of fried \"masa\" (ground maize soaked in lime, also used as the basis for tamales and tortillas) with pinched sides. This is then topped with refried beans and crumbled cheese, lettuce, onions, red or green sauce (salsa, made with chiles or tomatillos, respectively), and sour cream. Sometimes other ingredients (mostly meat) are also added to create different tastes and styles of \"sopes\"; they are roughly the size of a fist.\n\nThe \"sope\" has spread throughout all Mexico's territory, and thousands of regional variants are made.\n\nWhile the pinched sides of the \"sope\" are its most distinctive characteristic, flat \"sopes\" are made to resemble a thick tortilla or a \"tostada\". However, though both \"tostadas\" and \"sopes\" are fried, the \"tostada\" is thin and fried until it becomes crunchy and fragile, while the \"sope\" is much thicker and fried only until the exterior surface is cooked. The \"sope\", therefore, has a soft, slightly pliable texture. The \"sope\"'s thickness is meant to support its toppings, and the frying of its exterior surface adds resistance to the moisture of the ingredients.\n\nThe most common variation of the \"sope\" involves simply adding chicken and is widely known as a \"sope de pollo\". \"Sopes\" topped with beef are also a common variation and are typically slightly larger than \"sopes de pollo\".\n\nIn the northern regions of Mexico, \"sopes\" are often prepared without vegetables, substituting black beans, spicy salsa, and \"longaniza\" or \"chorizo\", instead. In Acapulco and Guerrero, \"sopes\" are unusually small in size, so they are called \"sopecitos\" instead, and are fried in the same oil used to fry seafood, which gives them a unique taste. \"Sopecitos\" are made of beans and salsa only; no other ingredients are added.\n\nIn Oaxaca, \"sopes\" sometimes are prepared using \"chapulines\" (roasted grasshoppers) as topping. Also, an extremely large dish similar to a giant \"sope\" or a giant \"tostada\" is the traditional food of reference in Oaxaca known as \"tlayuda\".\n\nThe \"sope\" has been adopted and adapted to the local tastes of all Mexico's regions. This resulted in the creation of many traditional food specialties, which may appear to resemble the \"sope\", but are considered a different dish.\n\nThe most common variation is the \"huarache\", which is prepared in almost the same manner. However, the \"huarache\" normally is two or three times as large as a \"sope\" and has a characteristic oblong shape. \"Huaraches\" are usually topped with rib, chicken, or beefsteak meat. The name \"huarache\" is derived from the shape of the \"masa\", similar to the popular sandals. Toppings for the \"huarache\" include beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, ground beef, and salsa.\n\nThe \"tlacoyo\" is a completely different traditional Mexican dish which must not be confused with a \"sope\", but in some regions has started to be used in a similar way, as a base on top of which are placed the same ingredients used for \"sopes\". A 'tlacoyo\" is an oval fried or toasted cake made of \"masa\", torpedo-shaped and a lot fatter, since it is filled with beans or cheese.\n\nSince it is similar in shape to a\" huarache\" (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the\" sope\" and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to humid foods), Mexican street vendors decided to sell it adding toppings on it, as an alternative to the \"sope\". However, the traditional \"tlacoyo\" it is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it, and this form is mostly found as street food.\n\n\"Garnachas\" are small corn tortillas fried with shredded meat, crumbled dried cheese, and salsa. In many instances, \"garnachas\" may only have chopped onion and salsa on top. Similar in appearance to \"sopes\", they are a main specialty from Guatemala.\n\nOaxacan \"memelas\" are a local name for the identical \"sopes\" served in other parts of Mexico, just made with different toppings. \"Memelas\" are corn \"masa\" cakes topped with beans, salsa, shredded cabbage, \"mole negro, guacamole\", and cheese. \"Memelas\" have been served at Oaxacan/Mexican restaurants in the United States since the 1990s. In Puebla, they are often served by topping the fried masa with sauce - red sauce on one side and green sauce on the other side which is called \"estilo bandera\". Instead of meat, \"memelas\" in Puebla are served with sour cream, crumbled cheese, and diced onions on top of the red and green sauces.\n\nA \"chalupa\" is a \"tostada\" platter in Mexican cuisine, not a \"sope\", but its preparation method is quite similar. It is a specialty of south-central Mexico, such as the states of Puebla, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. It is made by pressing a thin layer of masa dough around the outside of a small mold and deep frying to produce a crisp, shallow corn cup. It is filled with various ingredients such as shredded chicken, pork, chopped onion, chipotle pepper, red salsa, and green \"salsa\".\n\nThe \"chalupa\" is usually longer than a \"sope\", resembling the canoe-like boat that is its namesake, although small versions (named \"chalupitas\") are available in other regions. An Americanized form is sold in Taco Bell restaurants, filled with ground meat, steak, or chicken, (and even bacon has also been available in past limited offers) and topped with cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and \"salsa\" (also comes in Baja style, replacing the sour cream with a Baja sauce), resembles an American taco inside, but is wrapped with deep-fried wheat flatbread.\n\nYucatecan food is very different from what is traditionally referred to as \"Mexican\" food, as the cuisine from this region includes the local Mayan culture combined with an unusual (for the rest of the country) European cuisine influence.\n\n\"Salbutes\" and \"panuchos\" are the Yucatecan variant of the \"sope\". \"Salbutes\" are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey, and avocado on top. \"Panuchos\" feature tortillas partially fried as a \"sope\" base, but filled with black beans and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado, and pickled onions. Habanero chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or puréed form, along with fresh limes or lime juice.\n\n\n"}

While \"goat\" is usually the name for the meat found in common parlance, producers and marketers may prefer to use the French-derived word chevon (from \"chèvre\"), since market research in the United States suggests that \"chevon\" is more palatable to consumers than \"goat meat\". Cabrito, a word of Spanish and Portuguese origin, refers specifically to young, milk-fed goat. In some parts of Asia, particularly India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the word \"mutton\" is sometimes used to describe both goat and sheep meat, despite its more specific meaning, limited to the meat of adult sheep, in the UK, US, Australia and other English-speaking countries.\n\nGoat is both a staple and a delicacy in world’s cuisines. The cuisines best known for their use of goat include African cuisine, Middle Eastern, North African, Indian, Indonesian, Nepali, Pakistani, Mexican, and Caribbean (Haiti). Cabrito, or baby goat, is a very typical food of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico; in Italy it is called capretto.\n\nGoat has historically been less commonplace in American, Canadian and Northern European cuisines but has become more popular in some niche markets, including those that serve immigrants from Asia and Africa who prefer goat to other meat. the number of goats slaughtered in the United States has doubled every 10 years for three decades, rising to nearly one million annually. While in the past goat meat in the West was confined to ethnic markets, it can now be found in a few upscale restaurants and purveyors, especially in cities such as New York and San Francisco. Brady, Texas has held its Annual World Championship BBQ Goat Cook-Off annually since 1973.Goat meat is savory and less sweet than beef but slightly sweeter than lamb. It can be prepared in a variety of ways, such as being stewed, curried, baked, grilled, barbecued, minced, canned, fried, or made into sausage. Goat jerky is also another popular variety. In Okinawa (Japan), goat meat is served raw in thin slices as \"yagisashi\". On the Indian subcontinent, the rice dish mutton \"biryani\" and the mutton curries prepared in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, uses goat meat / Khaasi (Castrated male goat) meat as a primary ingredient to produce a rich taste. \"Curry goat\" is a common traditional Indo-Caribbean dish. In Bangladesh, traditional meat dishes like kosha mangsho and rezala are prepared using meat from a \"Khashi\", a castrated goat with a meat that has richer taste and a milder, less gamey flavour. In Indonesia, goat meat is popularly skewered and grilled as \"sate kambing\", or curried in soups such as \"sup kambing\" and \"gulai kambing\".\n\nGoat meat is also a major delicacy in Nepal, and both castrated \"(Khashi-ko-masu)\" and uncastrated \"(Boka-ko-masu)\" goats are sacrificed during Dashain, the largest annual celebrations in the country, as well as on other festive occasions. There are many separate dishes, which together include all edible parts of the animal. \"Bhutun\" is made from the gut, \"Rakhti\" from the blood, \"Karji-marji\" from the liver and lungs, and the feet — \"Khutti\" — are often made into soup. Sukuti is a kind of jerky, while Sekuwa is made from roasted meat and often eaten with alcoholic beverages. In addition to these dishes, goat meat is often eaten as part of momos, thukpa, chow mein and other dishes in various parts of the country. Taas is another popular fried goat meat dish in Nepal, particularly popular in Chitwan district of Nepal.\n\nCabrito, a specialty especially common in Latin American cuisine such as Mexican, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Argentine, is usually slow roasted. In Mexican cuisine, there are a variety of dishes including Fritada (cooking the goat in its blood) and cabrito entomatado which means it is boiled in a tomato and spices sauce. Southern Italian, Greek and Portuguese cuisines are also known for serving roast goat in celebration of Easter (in Italian cuisines, minced goat is used in spaghetti bolognese and lasagna as an alternative for beef), with the North of Portugal serving it as well on Christmas day; goat dishes are also an Easter staple in the alpine regions of central Europe, often braised (Bavaria) or breaded and fried (Tyrol).\n\nIn Africa, the Chaga people of Tanzania, a ceremonial goat (locally called Ndafu) would be gutted and roasted as whole as part of tradition that spans hundreds of years. The ceremonial goat is the preferred replacement to the wedding cake used in many weddings around the world.\n\nGoat has a reputation for having a strong, gamey flavour, but the taste can also be mild, depending on how it is raised and prepared. Caribbean cultures often prefer meat from mature goats, which tends to be more pungent; while some other cultures prefer meat that comes from younger goats that are six to nine months old. Ribs, loins, and tenderloin goat meat are suitable for quick cooking, while other cuts are best for long braising. Despite being classified as red meat, goat is leaner and contains less cholesterol, fat, and protein than both lamb and beef, and less energy than beef or chicken; therefore, it requires low-heat, slow cooking to preserve tenderness and moisture.\n\nGoats consume less forage than beef cattle. A hectare of pasture can sustain 25 goats or more, compared to five steers. A goat may produce of meat, however, which is much less than from cattle or pigs, often making goats unsuitable for modern meat processors.\n\n\n"}

Kübler Absinthe was first produced in 1863 and was the first brand to be sold legally in Switzerland after the national ban on absinthe was lifted in March, 2005. The legalization of absinthe in Switzerland is largely due to Kübler's lobbying efforts. The United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved the formula for Kübler Absinthe in 2004, and approved the product for sale in the United States in May 2007 after three years of discussions among Kübler, Food and Drug Administration, TTB, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These discussions proved to be instrumental in opening the door for many brands of absinthe to be legally sold or produced in the United States.\n\nKübler was launched in 1863 by J. Fritz Kübler in Môtiers, Switzerland and is now a part of the Altamar Brands portfolio. Môtiers is the capital of the Val-de-Travers, the birthplace of absinthe. This region sits near the eastern border of France. Fritz opened the Blackmint Distillery in 1875, and received numerous awards and medals in competitions around the European theater before the Swiss government banned absinthe in 1910.\n\nIn 2001, the Swiss ban was lifted and the brand was revived by Fritz's great grandson Yves (a fifth generation Kübler), who runs the distillery only a few miles from its original site in the Val-de-Travers.\n\nThe principal ingredients in Kübler Absinthe are the herbs grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and anise. Kübler uses a grain neutral base spirit distilled from Swiss wheat and also includes hyssop, lemon balm, coriander, star anise, fennel, Roman wormwood and mint. All ingredients are analytically certified to the standards of the Swiss Expert Committee on the Unification of Pharmacopoeias.\n\nKübler Absinthe is distilled using the same traditional method that has been used for over one hundred years.\nFollowing the initial maceration is a slow distillation process. Neither sugar nor artificial coloring is added to the finished distillate. The end product is an all-natural, genuine Swiss clear or 'La Bleue' absinthe, and is bottled at 106 proof (53% ABV).\n\nJ.F. Kübler, the patriarch of the family, started the Kübler Absinthe tradition (1863). It continued until the Swiss absinthe prohibition was enacted on October 7, 1910. On October 10, 2001, exactly 91 years and three days after the start of the Swiss prohibition, Yves Kübler's first objective was reached: the distillation and sale of his first 500 liters of Kübler absinthe in Europe.\n\nIn March 2005, all federal Swiss absinthe laws were repealed, giving Yves the right to continue the tradition his great grandfather created. Kübler Absinthe is now available in many markets, including the United States.\n\nProof66.com, an aggregator of liquor ratings information from expert evaluators, describes the Kübler Superieure as a \"Tier 1\" spirit in its exotics category. Such spirits are said to have won \"the highest recommendation.\"\n\n"}

As both the coconut and the rice-plant are commonly found in the tropics all-around the world, coconut rice too is found in many cultures throughout the world, spanning across the equator from Southeast Asia to the Caribbean.\n\nIn Burmese cuisine, \"ohn htamin\" (), as rice cooked with coconut milk is called, is a ceremonial staple food, often eaten in lieu of plain white rice. In the most basic version of \"ohn htamin\", rice is cooked with a base of coconut milk, along with fried shallots and salt, adding to the rice's savory and rich flavours. \"Ohn htamin\" is commonly paired with Burmese-style \"sibyan\" curries.\n\nThe rice cooked in coconut milk is actually quite common in Indonesia, with each region developed their own version of it. In Indonesia, plain coconut rice is usually made from white rice, coconut milk, ginger, fenugreek seed, lemongrass and pandan leaves. The most common coconut rice recipe in Indonesia is \"nasi uduk\" from Jakarta. Another coconut milk rice recipes includes \"nasi gurih\" from Aceh and Javanese \"nasi liwet\". \"Nasi kuning\" is Indonesian yellow rice which is quite similar to coconut rice with addition of turmeric as coloring and flavoring agent. Another similar coconut rice recipe are rice dumplings with thicker texture, such as \"burasa\" from Makassar and \"lemang\" popular in Minangkabau.\n\n\"Nasi lemak\" (coconut milk and pandan leaf) is the most popular coconut rice recipe in Malaysia. It is considered a national dish of Malaysia.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, sweet coconut rice is very popular as a dessert or sweet snack. It is made with glutinous rice, coconut milk, sugar, salt and water and most famously paired with slices of ripe mango and an additional dollop of coconut cream. Outside of the mango season, it will also be eaten with other fruits or semi-sweet dishes. Other popular coconut rice desserts are \"khao tom mat\", where sweet banana is steamed inside sticky rice while wrapped in a banana leaf, \"khao lam\", where the rice and coconut milk mixture is steamed inside a section of bamboo, and \"khao niao kaeo\", a very sweet dessert of glutinous rice, coconut milk, and large amounts of sugar, and most often pink or green in color.\n\nIn India, coconut rice (Tamil: தேங்காய் சாதம்) is famous in the southern regions. In India coconut rice usually made from basmati rice with mild coconut flavours acquired from coconut milk, and commonly served with curries. It is made with coconut flakes (or grated or desiccated/dry coconut). One way to make this dish is to make the rice separately (preferably using a rice variety which is light and fluffy when cooked) and then mixing it with the coconut mixture (coconut flakes toasted in sesame/coconut oil and spiced with paprika, nuts, curry powder/leaves and other spices).\n\nIn Sri Lanka, coconut rice is often referred to as \"milk rice\" or \"kiri bath\". It is widely served across the nation on special occasions to mark the auspicious timings or moments. It is accompanied by \"lunu miris\" a spicy onion \"sambol\" ground with red chilli, onions, tomato, lime and salt with umbalakada.\n\nOn the Caribbean coast of Colombia and Panama, \"arroz con coco\" is a typical side dish for fish. It is made with white rice cooked in a base of coconut milk and combined with shredded coconut meat, water, salt, raisins (optional), and sugar.\n\nIn the Caribbean coast of Honduras, rice is traditionally cooked with coconut oil, coconut milk, garlic, onions and red or black beans, a hearty dish known as \"rice and beans\". This plate is especially popular among Hondurans of African ancestry (Garifuna), but like many other Garifuna plates and foods with African influence, it is popular among all Hondurans and regarded as a typical Honduran food by Hondurans of all racial backgrounds.\n\nIn Puerto Rico coconut rice is usually served with fish and sweet plantains. The rice is sautéed with coconut oil and salt, shredded coconut and coconut milk are then added with the option of garlic, onions, cilantro, raisins, and kumquats. The rice is then coved with a banana leaf during the cooking process. Another popular coconut rice dish is \"arroz con dulce\" (coconut rice pudding) a dessert made with milk, coconut milk, coconut cream, raisins, vanilla, rum, sugar, ginger, and spice. Puerto Rican rice pudding is popular in Colombia, Cuba, and Venezuela.\n\nIn Nigeria, coconut rice is made by cooking rice in the juice of shredded coconut flesh. The shredded coconut flesh is steeped in hot water and then drained to give \"milk.\" The milk can be added to a tomato base, such as that used for jollof rice, or cooked on its own with the rice.\n\n\n"}

In the past, the bakarkhaniwalas (bread-makers) used to lit up tandoor after midnight to bring out product by morning. Bakarkhani dough of white flour and mawa thoroughly mixed and kneaded for hours before stretching thin by hand over the entire span of wooden board. Then after spreading ghee (clarified butter) over it, flour is strewn on. It was folded and the process repeated several times. After sizeable numbers of such small dough are ready, they are made into roti on the board and sesame (teel) seeds are spread on it. The rotis are then put inside the tandoor. During the process of baking, pure milk is sprinkled on them twice. This is the story of making pure bakarkhanis. But now in place of ghee and milk, molasses solution is added so that the bread turns reddish.\n\nCheese bakarkhani was another delicacy. In every fold, instead of ghee and flour 'mohanbhog' mishti or semolina (suji) halwa was used. These breads known as 'bhigaroti or bhijaroti' are sent on 'dalas' (high rim trays) dipped in creamy milk with almond and raisins from the house of the bride to the groom as part of a traditional matrimonial ritual. This Mughali bread travelled all the way from the Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent during the time of the Mughals. Bakarkhani is prepared on certain Muslim religious festivals and is now popular as sweet bread.\n\nBakarkhani is almost biscuit-like in texture, with a hard crust. The chief ingredients are flour, semolina, sugar, molasses soaked in saffron, poppy or nigella seeds, salt, and ghee (clarified butter). Bakarkhani is part of Awadhi cuisine, Kashmiri cuisine, Mughlai cuisine, as well as the wider Indian cuisine, Pakistani cuisine, and Bangladeshi cuisine.\n\nBakerkhani is made by kneading together flour, ghee, in some cases cardamom, sugar and salt with water. The dough is then flattened. The bread is made by stretching a sheet of dough repeatedly and interleaving with ghee, molasses, saffron water, poppy or nigella seeds before baking on a tandoor or tawa girdle.\n\nKashmiri Bakarkhani has a special place in Kashmiri cuisine. It is a thinner variety similar to a round naan in appearance, but crisp and layered, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.\n\nKashmiri bakarkhani is typically consumed hot, during breakfast often with noon chai.\n\n"}

{"id": "13498417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13498417", "title": "Vincotto", "text": "Vincotto\n\nVincotto (translated as \"cooked wine\") is a dark, sweet, thick paste produced by country people in the Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Lombardy, Apulia, and Marche regions of Italy. It is made by the slow cooking and reduction over many hours of non-fermented grape must until it has been reduced to about one-fifth of its original volume and the sugars present have caramelized. It can be made from a number of varieties of local red wine grapes, including \"Primitivo\", \"Negroamaro\" and \"Malvasia Nera\", and before the grapes are picked they are allowed to wither naturally on the vine for about thirty days. In Roman times it was known as sapa in Latin and epsima in Greek, the same names that are often used for it in Italy and Cyprus, respectively, today.\n\nVincotto has a sweet flavor, and is not a form of vinegar, though a sweet vinegar version can be produced using a vincotto as a base. This additional product is called a Vinegar of Vincotto, Vincotto vinegar, or Vincotto balsamic and can be used in the same way as a good mellow Balsamic vinegar.\n\nVincotto appears to be related to \"defrutum\" and other forms of grape juice boiled down to varying strengths (\"carenum\", \"sapa\") that were produced in Ancient Rome. Defrutum was used to preserve, sweeten, and/or flavor many foods (including wine), by itself or with honey or \"garum\". Defrutum was also consumed as a drink when diluted with water, or fermented into a heady Roman \"wine\". (Note: defrutum should not be confused with \"passum\", a wine made from fermented raisins that originated in ancient Carthage and was popular in ancient Rome. Passum was therefore more similar to modern Vin Santo than to vincotto.)\n\nOver many centuries, the vincotto produced in the Salento area of Apulia (the \"heel\" of Italy), was further developed into several different varieties of higher quality and culinary sophistication.\n\nIn Salento – in the heel of Italy – Vincotto is produced from the slow reduction together of a blend of cooked grape must and of a wine that has started to spoil and sour attaining the consistency of dense non-alcoholic syrup. This tradition goes back to the times of the ancient Romans when grape musts were reduced over heat to facilitate conservation and transportation. In more recent times, from 1863, Salento, an area of Apulia, greatly expanded the vineyards which also led to a great increase in the production of Vincotto.\n\nVincotto can be used as a sweet condiment, as well as being sparingly drizzled over strongly flavored foods such as game, roast meats and poultry, aged cheeses, and risotto.\n\nDue to the nature of the Apulian red grapes, wines are produced with very high polyphenol counts. These work as antioxidants and are good for health, and act as strong natural flavour enhancers when added to other ingredients in a culinary recipe.\n\nVincotto without the added vinegar and vino cotto are synonymous, as it's called vino cotto in southern Italian regions such as Calabria. These names cannot be registered as a trademark by any producer.\n\nIn Greek, vincotto is called petimezi and is only produced in Crete.\n\nIn Croatia, this product is called \"varenik\", and is produced on the Dalmatian islands and in the Dubrovnik and Skradin region.\n\nLike a dense sweet balsamic \"vinegar\", the balsamic vincotto Agrodolce version can also be used to dress salads and season cooked vegetables, and can even be used in desserts such as fruits or ice cream.\n\nThese are produced by blending a sweet matured vincotto with vinegar produced from the same red grape varieties. The resulting product is allowed to mature for several more months until it becomes \"legato\", which means \"smooth\". The result is an Apulian balsamic vinegar that can be used in the same way as a balsamic vinegar of Modena, although it does have some additional properties. Red Apulian grapes and wines exhibit a very high polyphenol count, and these act as antioxidants and as a natural flavour enhancer with other foods. They can enhance other flavours when used in a recipe, while not overpowering them, and as is usually the case with other balsamic vinegars, they can be reduced over heat without any bitter caramelization.\n\nCalogiuri vincotti are also produced in a variety of aromatized or flavoured versions in much in the same way as flavoured extra virgin olive oils. Locally grown fruits are used, including fig, carob, quince, lemon, orange, raspberry, or chili pepper. This is an adaptation of traditional Apulian vincotto, but should not be confused with the understanding of generic Apulian vincotti.\n\n"}

Similar to gruel or porridge, it is eaten in many North African and Middle Eastern countries. Considered one of the most popular desserts and traditional dish in many Arab countries. It is particularly popular in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Libya, Somalia, Tunisia. It is usually eaten by hand, without the use of utensils. Often served during religious holidays such as Mawlid and Eid, it is also served during traditional ceremonies accompanying the birth of child, such as the \"‘aqīqah\", the cutting of the hair of a newborn seven days after birth.\n\nA simple yet rich dish, often eaten without other complementary dishes, it is traditionally served at breakfast and is also fed to women in labor.\n\nThe word \"asida\" is an Arabic word that is derived from the root عصد (\"asad\"), meaning 'twist it'.\n\nOne of the earliest documented recipes for asida is found in a tenth century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq called \"Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ\" (, \"The Book of Dishes\"). It was described as a thick pudding of dates cooked with clarified butter (samn). Also a recipe for asida was mentioned in an anonymously authored Hispano-Muslim cookbook dating to the 13th century. In the 13th and 14th centuries, in the mountainous region of the Rif along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, a flour made from lightly grilled barley was used in place of wheat flour. A recipe for asida that adds argan seed oil was documented by Leo Africanus (c. 1465-1550), the Arab explorer known as Hasan al-Wazan in the Arab world. According to the French scholar Maxime Rodinson, asida were typical foods among the Bedouin of pre-Islamic and, probably, later times.\n\nThe Libyan variation of asida is served with a sweet syrup, usually date or carob syrup (rub), but also with honey.\n\nA Sudanese version of this dish is served with a savory, tomato-based sauce. Okra in the sauce gives it a somewhat slimy consistency, and the asida is eaten regularly, not only on special occasions.\n\nThe Tunisian version of this dish is served with either a mixture of honey and butter, or tomato-based hot sauce. The latter is more common later in the day and the former earlier. Assida is also commonly consumed with date syrup in southern parts of Tunisia.\n\nAseedah or aseed () is one of the staple dishes in Yemen and is usually served for lunch, dinner or both. Its ingredients include wholemeal wheat, boiling water and salt as needed.\n\nOn a high heat a pot is placed and then boiling water is added. Slowly, handfuls of wholemeal wheat are added and then are mixed quickly with a large wooden spoon so that clumps do not form. The process is repeated until the mixture is very thick. Traditionally the cook lowers the pot to the floor where they wrap their flip-flops around the hot pot and start vigorously mixing the dough. Finally, using bare oiled hands the hot, steaming dough is shaped by the cook and usually placed in a wide, wooden bowl.\n\nSometimes a depression is made in the middle of the shaped Aseedah so that a hot chili tomato paste is added or Helba, a fenugreek mixture made with parsley and garlic. Lamb or chicken stock is then poured around the Aseedah. It is then served hot.\n\nAseedah can also be made using white, bleached wheat. Furthermore honey can be used instead of stock and chili/Helba.\n\nIt is a meal, using only boiled water, flour, and some salt. Typically it is smothered in beef soup or chicken or even lamb. \n\nIt is usually served boiling hot and eaten with hands or spoons.\n\nAseed is eaten particularly at lunchtime and during Ramadan.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1987, National Distillers Group sold the spirits business to the Fortune Brands holding company, which became Beam Inc. \n\nToday, Old Grand-Dad is one of the ten best-selling straight whiskeys. It comes in three different bottling proofs: 80 proof, 100 proof Bottled In Bond, and 114 Barrel Proof in a short-height bottle gift box package. In 2013 the lower proof offering went from 86 proof to 80 proof.\n\nSince 1992 Beam has also marketed another brand of Kentucky bourbon, Basil Hayden's, named after the same person.\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy said \"The sweet corn of this whiskey is hot on the lips but has a mild finish of vanilla and baking spices.\"\n\n\n"}

In most such languages, in fact, all classes inherit directly or indirectly from a single root, usually with a name similar to Object; all classes then form a common inheritance hierarchy.\n\nThis idea was introduced first by Smalltalk, and was since used in most other object-oriented languages (notably Java and C#).\n\nA notable exception is C++, where (mainly for compatibility with C and efficiency) there is no single object hierarchy. This feature is especially useful for container libraries - they only need to allow putting an Object in a container to allow objects of any class to be put in the container. Containers in C++ have been implemented with multiple inheritance, and with help of template-based generic programming by Bjarne Stroustrup. Other object-oriented languages without a singly rooted hierarchy include Objective-C and PHP.\n\n"}

It can be preserved for months making it popular in the off season of mangoes.\n\nMango pulp is mixed with potassium metabisulfite and spread on trays to dry in the sun. After the first layer dries, another layer is spread over it and allowed to dry. The process is repeated until the desired thickness is reached. The thickness varies depending upon the quality of mango pulp used. When this thickness is reached the aam papad is cut into pieces and wrapped in oiled paper or into different packages.\n\nAam Papad can be consumed in any season as it can be preserved for a long period of time.\n\nAam Papad is manufactured in North India as well as South India. In the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the Adavinekkalam village in East Godavari district is famous for its \"mamidi tandra\".\n\nAam Papad is also exported abroad from India. In 2011, the Canadian Inspection Food Agency(CIFA) warned sulphites-sensitive people to avoid the \"Indican\" brand Aam Papad, as it contained sulphites but did not declare that on the label.\n"}

A semi-liquid rice flour dough is usually prepared by adding milk, water, cooking oil, sugar, ghee, butter, cardamom, cloves, bananas and other flavours of personal choice. The ingredients are mixed well by stirring. Once the semi liquid dough is ready, it is deep fried in boiling oil or ghee.\n\nThe dough is poured by hand on home-made shortening or oil in ring shape and cooked on high heat until it turns light brown on both sides. Two sticks called \"jhir\" in the local language, each long are used for turning the bread while cooking.\n\nSel roti are cooked in bulk and can be stored at room temperature for least 20 days. Sel roti are often sent as special gifts to family members living away from home or used as prasad in puja.\n\nSel roti is a delicacy - made mainly for the great Nepali celebration of the Dashain and Tihar festivals. \nIt is unique to Nepal and has become an iconic symbol of Nepali culture and festivities, and is made and served throughout the country during the festivals of Dasain, Tihar and Teej; and during wedding parties, bratabandha and other ceremonies.

It is also known as \"country lemon\" and \"leems\". Diced, quartered, halved, or whole, lemons are pickled in a brine of water, lemon juice, and salt; occasionally spices are included as well. The pickle is allowed to ferment at room temperature for weeks or months before it is used. The pulp of the preserved lemon can be used in stews and sauces, but it is the peel (zest and pith together) that is most valued. The flavor is mildly tart but intensely lemony.\n\nPieces of pickled lemon may be washed before using to remove any surface salt, or blanched to remove more of the salt and bring out the natural mild sweetness. They may then be sliced, chopped, or minced as needed for the texture of the dish. The rind may be used with or without the pulp.\n\nPreserved lemon is the key ingredient in many Moroccan dishes such as \"tagines.\" In Cambodian cuisine, it is used in dishes such as \"ngam nguv\", a chicken soup with whole preserved lemons. They are often combined in various ways with olives, artichokes, seafood, veal, chicken, and rice.\n\nThe pickled pulp and liquid can be used in Bloody Marys and other beverages where lemon and salt are used. The flavor also combines well with horseradish, as in American-style cocktail sauce.\n\nIn Ayurvedic cuisine, lemon pickle is a home remedy for stomach disorders, and its value is said to increase as it matures. In East African folk medicine, lemon pickle is given for excessive growth of the spleen.\n\nLime and grapefruit also are pickled in this manner.\n\nHistorically, pickling was an affordable and practical method of preserving lemons for use long after their season and far away from where they are grown. Early 19th-century English, American, and (in translation) Indian cookbooks give recipes for lemon pickle and mention its use in sauces for salmon, veal, etc.; dishes where today fresh lemon zest and/or juice would be used.\n\nAn early 19th century recipe is as follows, taken from \"A New System of Domestic Cookery\":\nA similar recipe appears in Mary Randolph's 1824 cookbook. Similar recipes also appear in earlier cookbooks, such as the 18th century cookbook by English housekeeper Elizabeth Raffald. Some recipes include grating or thinly peeling the lemons, and preserving the peels (zest) which were dried for later use.\n\nFermentation is a mechanism which requires the use of microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast in order to break down carbohydrates into other by-products such as alcohol and organic acids. Also proteins and lipids can be broken down through fermentation.\n\nFermentation is typically accomplished in environments in which oxygen is absent (anaerobic). The two methods of fermentation are lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation, which have been used for centuries. Through fermentation, products such as wine, cheese, yogurt, pickles and preserved lemons are produced. Several health benefits are associated with fermented foods such as an increase in the production of B-vitamins. Through fermentation B-vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, and probiotics are made. Additionally, food that is normally indigestible can be digested once the food has been fermented due to bacterial synthesis which allows the digestive tract to absorb more nutrients from the food (increased bioavailability).\n\nIn contrast to the unpeeled lemon, the amount of vitamins within the preserved lemons is reduced, along with a loss of minerals and simple carbohydrates such as sugar and starch. \n\nThe process of fermentation is a complex one and causes a multitude of changes at the exterior and interior levels of the lemon. All of the known exterior changes are observable with the human eye. These changes include a wrinkling of the skin along with a slight browning of the interior portion of the lemon (if sliced), due to oxidation.\n\nAlthough there is not much research on the chemical reactions that take place within lemons during the preservation process of fermentation, using research based on other fruits and through observation, conclusions can be made with supporting evidence. With the definition above we can be concluded that the sugar and starch within the lemons are chemically broken down during the fermentation process. Based on the nutritional value, it can also be theorized that protein is broken down or hydrolyzed during the fermentation process as there is an absence of the macronutrient post-fermentation.\n\nThere are also a number of factors that can influence the success rate and level of safety in regards to fermentation. Fermentation can be heavily affected by compositional factors within the fruit such as pH, buffer capacity and initial sugar content. All of these factors can be altered depending on the size of the fruit as the larger the fruit, the more nutritional value the fruit will hold. Additionally, pesticides can have a huge effect on fermentation. If pesticides are left, in large quantities, on the fruits surface during fermentation, the process of preservation increases the potency of the hazardous materials within the pesticides.\n\nA common macronutrient used in curing is salt, which increases the osmolarity of the liquid to inhibit the growth of certain classes of microorganisms. This effect creates a difficult environment for those bacteria to survive in and allows the growth of salt-tolerant microbes. Salt also helps extend shelf life. The juice from the lemon is acidic and contains citric acid that helps lower the pH, which additionally restricts microbes that can cause spoilage and disease. For preservation of lemons, the use of antioxidants as a food additive is used to prevent lipid peroxidation and the fading of food color.\n\nAlthough lemons contain citric acid, most citric acid is produced by fermentation uses microbes that can convert sugars into citric acid, which is the most important organic acid produced in tonnage and is extensively used in food and pharmaceutical industries. It is produced mainly by submerged fermentation using \"Aspergillus niger\" or \"Candida\" spp. from different sources of carbohydrates, such as molasses and starch-based media. The food and beverage industries use this acid extensively as a food additive globally.\n\n"}

The choice of functions for the canonical set can be biased toward specific types of patterns and regularities. For example, periodic functions such as sine produce segmented patterns with repetitions, while symmetric functions such as Gaussian produce symmetric patterns. Linear functions can be employed to produce linear or fractal-like patterns. Thus, the architect of a CPPN-based genetic art system can bias the types of patterns it generates by deciding the set of canonical functions to include.\n\nFurthermore, unlike typical ANNs, CPPNs are applied across the entire space of possible inputs so that they can represent a complete image. Since they are compositions of functions, CPPNs in effect encode images at infinite resolution and can be sampled for a particular display at whatever resolution is optimal.\n\nCPPNs can be evolved through neuroevolution techniques such as neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (called CPPN-NEAT).\n\nCPPNs have been shown to be a very powerful encoding when evolving the following:\n\n\n"}
