Countries around world offer various kinds of school meal programs. Each week day, millions of children from all standards and grades receive meals at their respective schools. School meals provide high-energy food with high nutritional values either free or at economical rates.\n\nThe benefits of school meals vary from country to country. While in developed countries the school meal is a source of nutritious meals, in developing countries it is an incentive to send children to school and continue their education. In developing countries, school meals provide food security at times of crisis and help children to become healthy and productive adults, thus helping to break the cycle of poverty and hunger.\n\nThe first school lunches were served in 1790 in Munich, Germany by an American born physicist, Benjamin Thompson, also known as Count Rumford. Thompson had spent his early days in New England but as a royalist during the American Revolutionary War he had become distrusted and left for England in 1784. In Munich, Thompson founded the Poor People's Institute which employed both adults and children to make uniforms for the German Army. They were fed and clothed for their work and the children taught reading, writing and arithmetic. Years later Thompson would feed 60,000 people a day from his soup kitchen in London. Benjamin Thompson pioneered institutional feeding of the poor and is credited with introducing the potato to the diet of the European poor, inventing the double boiler, the kitchen range, baking oven, pressure cooker, drip coffee maker which are the forerunners to the steam jacketed kettle, compartment steamer, and commercial ovens used for school food programs today.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, significant changes have been made from when school meals were introduced in the nineteenth century. The first National School Meals Policy was published across the United Kingdom in 1941. The Policy set the first nutritional guidelines for school lunches, requiring balanced meals which include the appropriate levels of protein, fat, and calories.\n\nIn the United states, there was a social inequality gap during the industrial era and there was room for improvement in all realms of education. Poor children were experiencing malnutrition and hunger due to a low income of families. Philadelphia and Boston were the first 2 cities to institute school lunches in the U.S. Organizations such as Women's Education and the Starr Center Association began serving hot meals to students for a cost that was affordable for most. Soon after, teachers started to notice the benefits of students both mentally and physically. The federal government wasn't involved until the Great Depression (1920's), farmers and labors weren't doing well financially and the school lunch program was a solution that benefited everyone. \n\nSweden, Finland, Estonia and India are among the few countries which provide free school meals to all pupils in compulsory education, regardless of their ability to pay. Many countries provide meals to improve attendance rates. In India, where all the Government School students are provided with free lunch meals through the Midday Meal Scheme, staple food that varies between different states and regions is provided along with free education.\n\nIn high-income countries, free meals are usually available only to children who meet income-based criteria.\n\nA study of a free school meal program in the United States found that providing free meals to elementary and middle school children in areas characterized by high food insecurity led to better school discipline among the students.\n\nReduced price meals are also available in some countries to those who need a degree of assistance with costs. Lower-cost meals are available to students in such countries as France, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.\n\nSchool lunches in Denmark commonly include items like fruit, roasted duck, potatoes, and red or white cabbage.\n\nIn Estonia, free school dinners are served in elementary and secondary schools.\n\nNutritional guidelines for Estonian school meals are based on the Estonian food pyramid. At the pyramid's base are water and exercise. The next tier up includes starches, fruits, and vegetables. According to Estonia's Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, these foods should comprise the majority of each meal. The middle section of the pyramid includes dairy products and meat. The Guidelines suggest eating these foods in small portions on a daily basis. Just below the top tier are oils, butter and nuts. At the peak of the pyramid are foods like ice cream, soft drinks, honey, and biscuits: high-sugar foods which should be eaten sparingly, as special treats.\n\nFinland provides free, catered hot school meals to all pupils from pre-primary to upper secondary education every school day, as guaranteed by the 1948 Basic Education Act. Section 31 of the Basic Education Act states: \"A pupil attending basic education shall be provided with a balanced and appropriately organized and supervised meal on every school day.\"\n\nSome Finnish cities had offered poor students free school dinners since the beginning of the 20th century. For example, Kuopio did so starting in 1902, and extended school dinners to all students in 1945.\n\nAccording to Finnish National Board of Education statistics from the year 2014, the average school meal was valued at 2.80 euros per student-school day, totaling 532 euros per student for the school year. This sum included ingredients, labor costs, kitchen equipment, and other fixed expenses, but neither property costs nor taxes.\n\nChildren taking part in before- and after-school activities are also served a free healthy snack.\n\nLunches for higher education students (like those attending universities and polytechnics) are also subsidized in Finland. Kela, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, compensates student meals that fulfill the nutritional and pricing criteria for government meal subsidies. This program's purpose is to promote positive health and nutritional trends among students. The program accommodates special dietary needs – whether in connection with religion, ethical beliefs, or health issues – without extra costs.\n\nFree school meals in Finland are viewed as an investment for the future; the aim is to maintain and improve children's health, well-being, and learning. The school meal is used as a pedagogical tool for teaching table manners, food culture, nutrition, and healthy eating habits, as well as for increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits and berries, wholemeal bread, and skimmed or low-fat milk. One of the basic lessons is cooperation between students, head teachers, teachers, parents, and catering staff. In many schools, students participate in the work of the school canteen during their . Most schools have a school meal committee where students, teachers, and catering staff develop school catering together. Most schools also welcome parents to come and taste school meals. There are always adults present in the school restaurant. The pedagogical role of the school catering staff is seen as important, as is teachers' knowledge of nutrition. In 2009, Finland began developing school meal and nutrition education for teachers, and pedagogical education for school catering personnel.\n\nNational and local regulations form the basis for Finnish school meal practices. Education acts and decrees and local curricula are central documents governing school meals. Local and school-level curricula define the central principles of arranging school catering. The curricula also describe the objectives for education in health, nutrition, and manners. The health-related and social role of school meals, the objectives of teaching nutrition and manners, and the recreational aspect of lunch breaks are taken into account when arranging school meals and snacks. Students are allowed at least 30 minutes for eating, after which they have a short recess outdoors.\n\nSchool lunches can also be a channel for empowering local food producers. Introducing locally produced fish to the offerings of institutional kitchens, such as school canteens, is an ethical and ecological alternative to mass-produced meat or imported fish.\n\nSchool meals generally consist of typical Finnish foods. A basic school meal consists of a warm main course, vegetables, bread, a table spread, and a drink. The school lunch is calculated to equate to about one-third of a child’s daily nutritional needs. School catering is designed to follow the National Nutrition Council's dietary guidelines for schools. The recommendations for school meals are being updated during the year 2016.\n\nNormally, Finnish schools provide lunch at school canteens in the form of a buffet, where pupils serve themselves as much as they want. Schools often use a model plate to guide eating habits towards the following recommendations:\n\nChildren with special dietary needs – whether in connection with religion, ethical beliefs or health issues – are entitled to a special diet without costs. School menus are designed to be suitable for most students, with minor adjustments if needed. If a child has special dietary needs, their school requires specific information about those needs to ensure food safety and the elimination of possible cross contamination. In the case of health-related special diets, schools require the assessment of a doctor, nurse, or dietitian.\n\nAs with school lunches, before- and after-school snacks are used as a pedagogical tool in teaching children about proper nutrition, table manners, and food culture. Snacks are designed to offer variety and take into consideration Finnish Nutrition Recommendations as well as children’s individual needs.\n\nFinland has no national accreditation system to evaluate the quality of school lunches. However, by the end of 2015, over 200 schools had been awarded the School Lunch Diploma. The diploma certifies a school's commitment to the national standards and recommendations for nutritionally, educationally, and ecologically sustainable school lunches. It is also an indication of excellent collaboration among interest groups within the school. The School Lunch Diploma is coordinated by the Finnish Kitchen Professionals Association.\n\nIn the 1970s, the French government began to work on improving school lunches. In 1971, the government established nutritional guidelines for French school meals. The 1971 food recommendation guidelines stated that each meal should contain raw vegetables, such as salads and fruits; protein in the form of milk or other dairy products; cooked vegetables twice per week; and carbohydrates on the remaining days.\n\nIn France, lunch is considered the most important meal of the day. Students can get lunch at school or go home for it. The lunch break is one to two hours long. French students are taught to take time to savor and enjoy their meals. Students have to pay for cafeteria lunches; the cost of the meal varies by region. A student's family pays for half of the meal, while the school pays for the remainder. For example, a typical meal may cost $6, with the family paying $3 instead of the full price.\n\nThe 2001 food recommendation guidelines, signed by the Minister for National Education, state that school lunches must be healthy and balanced. Menus vary daily, and are posted for parents. Specifically, the guidelines state that:\n\nSchool cafeterias serve five-course meals, even for preschoolers. Schoolchildren eat the same things as adults. A school lunch in France contains an appetizer, salad, main course, cheese plate, and dessert. Bread may accompany each meal. A menu might include potato leek soup, carrot and bean salad, lamb with saffron, an assortment of cheeses, and grapefruit. Each meal is accompanied with water.\n\nFrench schools do not have vending machines.\n\nSchool meals in Italy provide regular Italian cuisine, although they may vary among regions and towns. The Italian government is very \"down to people\" and is doing a large-scale study to measure and involve students in food habits, diets, and food choices.\n\nNorwegian school lunches were supplied from Sweden during World War II, partly privately financed. Later, all public school lunches were discontinued, so most Norwegian students bring a packed lunch from home. In 2007, schools began providing one free piece of fruit each day for all pupils in grades 8–10. Norwegian schools also sell subsidized milk.\n\nSchool lunches have been free in Swedish elementary schools since 1973. The government or municipality covers all charges. Normally, school lunches are buffet-style. Buffets chiefly include potatoes, pasta or rice; meat or fish; and vegetables. Milk and water are usually offered as drinks. There are also vegetarian options, as well as foods that meet religious requirements; these foods are also free of charge. Upper secondary schools do not have to provide meals for their students, but many, both public and charter schools do.\n\nUsually, each municipality signs a private contract with a catering company which provides school food. Many of the food products are imported, but still have a good standard. In many schools, teachers or the school principal eat with the pupils, with the goal of creating a stronger connection between students and school authorities. In Swedish schools there are also international food weeks, or vegetarian weeks.\n\nSchool meal programs in the United Kingdom can be traced back to the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906.\n\nIn 1944, the United Kingdom required local authorities to provide school dinners that were consistent with legal nutritional requirements. The government paid the full cost of school meals in 1947. Free school meals were available to children with families on very low incomes. As a result, from the 1950s onward, staple traditional \"school dinner\" foods became embedded in the national psyche. \"School puddings\" in particular refers to desserts historically served with school dinners in state and private schools. Examples include tarts such as gypsy tart and Manchester tart, and hot puddings such as spotted dick and treacle sponge pudding.\n\nIn the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government ended entitlement to free meals for thousands of children, and obliged local authorities to open up provision of school meals to competitive tender. This was intended to reduce the cost of school meals provided by local authorities. However, it caused a substantial decrease in the standard of school food. A 1999 survey by the Medical Research Council suggested that despite rationing, children in 1950 had healthier diets than their counterparts in the 1990s, with more nutrients and less fat and sugar.\n\nThis became a major topic of debate in 2004, when chef Jamie Oliver spearheaded a campaign to improve the quality of school meals. At this time, school dinners at state schools were normally made by outside caterers. The schools sold a lot of deep-fried fast food, like chips, fried turkey nuggets, pizza, and pies. After the \"Jamie's School Dinners\" programme was shown on Channel 4, sections of the public showed support for increased school meal funding, causing the government to create the School Food Trust. This topic became a factor in the 2005 UK general election.\n\nMartha Payne's blog NeverSeconds, which discussed the quality of school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, made national headlines after gaining support from Jamie Oliver.\n\nSince September 2014, all infant pupils in England's schools have been entitled to a free hot meal at lunchtime every day. This was an initiative of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who launched the plan at the Liberal Democrats conference in 2013. At the initiative's inception, the government was paying £2.30 for each meal taken by newly eligible pupils.\n\nThe British government uses entitlement to free school meals as a measure of deprivation. For the financial year 2014-2015, the government paid schools a premium of £1,300 for primary-aged pupils, or £935 for secondary-aged pupils, for each eligible child. 11% of families entitled to free meals do not claim them, which means that their schools do not receive the extra funding. It was unclear in 2014 how this would be affected by the introduction of universal free meals for the youngest British schoolchildren.\n\nSince January 2015, the Scottish government has provided free school meals for all children in Primary One to Three.\n\nThe National Union of Teachers supports free school meals for all children. Fiona Twycross campaigned to persuade the Labour Party to commit to providing universal free school meals. She argues that according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Centre for Social Research, free school meals for all students significantly increases attainment in schools.\n\nA typical school lunch in the People's Republic of China includes staple food, meat diet, vegetable dish, and each school has different kind of dishes. Students can choose between two and three dishes according to their preferences, with a staple food, usually rice. \n\nIn impovrished rural areas, students' access to nutritious food is limited. The government has funded \"nutritious lunch\" schemes in rural public schools to combat malnutrition. Government data from June 2017 indicated that 48% of schools were unable to fully meet recommended nutrition standards.\n\nThe roots of India's school meal program can be traced back to the pre-independence era, when a mid day meal programme was introduced in 1925 in Madras Corporation by the British administration. This was one of the oldest free food programmes for schoolchildren. In 1975, the Indian government created the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme. Under the Midday Meal Scheme, government high schools and partially aided schools, along with Anganwadis, provide midday meals to students. The meals are free of cost and meet guidelines that have been set by policy.\n\nBy 1998, India had deployed the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) scheme. During the 2013-2014 school year, the scheme covered 104 million children in 1.16 million schools.\n\nThe Akshaya Patra Foundation, a public-private partnership in the Midday Meal Program, is a school meal program run by a non-governmental organization. Akshaya Patra started serving 1,500 children in the year 2000. Today it serves lunch to over 1.4 million school children in 10 Indian states every day.\n\nA single afternoon lunch usually contains a cereal which is locally available, made in a way that conforms to prevailing local customs. Each child receives milk, and either soup or vegetables cooked as curry. The menu is occasionally varied to appeal to students.\n\nChildren in private schools usually carry their own lunch boxes. Many schools also have canteens, and street food vendors can often be found in front of school campuses.\n\nIn the 1960s, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had intended a non-violent regeneration of Iranian society through economic and social reforms called the White Revolution. The reforms' long-term goal was to transform Iran into a global economic and industrial power. The White Revolution consisted of 19 elements that were introduced over a period of 15 years. In 1975, the Shah started a program for 'Free and Compulsory Education and a daily free meal' for all children from kindergarten to 14 years of age. It provided one-third of a pint of free milk to all children in Iran, as well as pistachios, fresh fruit, and biscuits.\n\nIn Japan, the tradition of providing school lunches started in the early 20th century. After World War II, which brought near-famine conditions to the country, the Japanese government re-introduced school lunches in urban areas. School lunch was extended to all elementary schools in Japan in 1952. With the enactment of the School Lunch Law in 1954, school meals were extended to junior high schools as well.\n\nThese early lunches initially included items such as bread, bread rolls, and skimmed milk powder (replaced in 1958 by milk bottles and cartons). Later, lunches were expanded to include flour donated by an American charity; a dessert; and a dish (such as daikon) that changed daily. Other dishes included inexpensive protein such as stewed bean dishes, fried white fish, and, until the 1970s, whale meat. Provisions of rice were introduced in 1976, following a surplus of government-distributed Japanese rice, and became increasingly frequent during the 1980s. Hamburg steak, stew and Japanese curry became staples as well.\n\nAs of 2004, 99% of elementary school students and 82% of junior high school students in Japan ate \"kyūshoku\" (school lunch). The food is grown locally, is almost never frozen, and (barring dietary restrictions) is the same for every student. Children in most districts cannot bring their own meals to school until they reach high school, nor do schools have vending machines; instead, children are taught to eat what they are served.\n\nIn both elementary school and middle school, students put on white coats and caps and serve their classmates, who then all eat together in their classrooms instead of in a cafeteria.\n\nTo make lunches affordable for students, municipalities pay for the labor costs, while parents, who are billed monthly, pay for the ingredients. These typically cost about 250 to 300 yen (about USD $3) per meal per student. There are reduced-price and free options for poorer families.\n\nThe daily bento boxes are designed by nutritionists to provide a balanced yet tasty meal for schoolchildren, working especially to appeal to picky or unhealthy eaters. According to Chico Harlan:\n\nCommon dishes range from Asian myeon, tom yam, and ma po tofu, to Western foods such as spaghetti, stew, and clam chowder.\n\nIn most Malaysian schools, regardless of whether they are public or private schools, students eat in a canteen where they purchase food and drinks from vendors. School canteens usually offer Malay, Chinese, and Indian foods, with varieties of rice, noodles, and breads. The average Malaysian school canteen offers varieties of Nasi Lemak, Nasi Goreng, Chicken Rice, Popiah, and Laksa.\n\nSchool canteens sell food and drinks at reduced prices. Underprivileged students can apply for the free-food program which, depending on the school, is either sponsored by the school's parent-teacher association or by the Ministry of Education. Low-income students may also be eligible for the School Milk Program, which is funded by milk companies and non-governmental organizations.\n\nSchool meals in the Philippines appear to be relatively simplistic, consisting mainly of rice, meat, and gravy.\n\nSchool meals in most Singaporean primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges, are provided in each school's canteen (or tuckshop). The canteens consist of stalls which sell a variety of foods as well as beverages. To cater to the many races, religions, and cultures in Singapore, canteens often offer a range of cuisines, like Chinese, Indian, Malay, and Western foods.\n\nTo encourage healthier eating habits among children, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore launched the Healthy Eating in Schools Programme, which gives an award to schools which serve healthy meals. To receive the award, schools must reduce the sugar content in drinks and desserts, serve fewer deep-fried and fatty foods, and include two servings of greens in their meals.\n\nSchool lunches in South Korea include traditional foods like rice and kimchi (fermented cabbage). Other dishes may include sesame leaves stuffed with rice and covered with honey sauce; pumpkin potato soup; pancakes made of egg batter and green onions, with optional peppers and octopus; and cucumber-and-carrot salads.\n\nIn most schools, the students set and hand out the various dishes, and then clean them up.\n\nDue to the economic boom, obesity has developed into a known health concern amongst adolescents in the United Arab Emirates. The past three decades have seen the largest increases in child obesity. Studies have shown that rates of obesity among the UAE's schoolchildren have surpassed the child obesity rates in both the United States and Europe. Traditional cuisine in the Persian Gulf region, once high-fibre and low-fat, has become Westernized, and now consists of many more high-fat, high-sodium, and high-cholesterol foods. Exercise levels among children have also decreased rapidly, causing the surge of obesity in adolescents.\n\nCanada has no national school meal program, and elementary schools are usually not equipped with kitchen facilities. Parents are generally expected to provide a packed lunch for their children to take to school, or have their children return home to eat during the lunch period. However, some non-profit organizations dedicated to student nutrition programs do exist.\n\nMost Canadian middle schools (grades 6-8) and high schools (grades 9-12) have cafeterias that serve hot meals.\n\nSchool lunches at the national level began as a temporary New Deal project in 1933. By 1935 it was run by the WPA in 1935-42, as a way to employ the unemployed, feed hungry children, and reduce crop surpluses. It was ended in World War II when the WPA closed. In 1937 the WPA reported, \"In the past year and a half 80,000,000 hot well-balanced meals have been served at the rate of 500,000 daily in 10,000 schools throughout the country.\"\n\nThe permanent National School Lunch Program was created in 1946, with the National School Lunch Act. This legislation won rural support because it removed surplus food from the market and thus raised prices paid to farmers. Congress intended these meals to promote and protect child nutrition, while also supporting the consumption of American farm products.\n\nToday, the National School Lunch Program is a federal nutrition assistance program operating in over 101,000 public schools, non-profit private schools, and residential care institutions. It is regulated and administered at the federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The program provides \"nutritionally balanced meals\" at low or no cost to more than 31 million children each school day.\n\nSince its inception, the Program has expanded substantially. It now includes the School Breakfast Program, the Snack Program, a Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Summer Food Service Program. At the State level, the National School Lunch Program is usually administered by state education agencies, which operate the program through agreements with school food authorities.\n\nSchool meal programs in the United States provide meals free of charge, or at a reduced (government-subsidized) price, to the children of low-income families. Those who do not qualify for free or reduced price are charged a nominal fee.\n\nSome issues stem students individual needs and the increase in food allergies \n\nSchool lunches must meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Regulations also state that school lunches must provide one-third of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, iron, calcium, and calories. School lunches must meet federal nutrition requirements over the course of one week's worth of lunches. However, local school food authorities may make decisions about which specific foods to serve and how they are prepared.\n\nA recent advocate of nutritional lunches was Michelle Obama. Since the Healthy, Hunger-Free Act of 2010 Michelle Obama has worked diligently to defend the importance of healthy school lunches but, has not been successful in her efforts. Schools, specifically in the United states, are having difficulty enforcing nutrition values in fear of being wasteful because children are no longer eating their lunches. Information gathered from students, schools, and food service experts prompted that they cannot met the regulations required for the Healthy, Hunger-Free Act of 2010. Providing schools with whole grains, whole milk, and reduced sodium levels was a part of the act, but the Senate would not fully comply. To compromise, they agreed to serve more fruits and vegetables, more whole grains and reduce the sodium levels. The levels of sodium were to be reduced but these efforts have been postponed for at least 3 years due to inappropriate planning. To avoid further conflict between the senate and the administration, the USAD has tolerated exemptions pertaining to the whole grain standard and allowed schools to do what they find necessary to finding a more fitting solution.\n\nVending machines in schools are also a major source of competitive food for students. Under pressure from parents and anti-obesity advocates, many school districts moved to ban sodas, junk foods, and candy from vending machines and cafeterias. Various laws have also been passed to limit foods sold in school vending machines. With increasing concern over traditional vending machines in schools, healthier vending options have gained popularity and are steadily being adopted by schools around the nation. Marketing for such \"healthy vending machines\" states that they allow students to perform better in school while also attaining better health.\n\nIn April 2012, the State of Osun in Nigeria pioneered a statewide school meals programme for all public elementary school pupils. It is called the O'Meals programme (an acronym for the Osun Elementary School Feeding and Health Programme). As of July 2014, it was providing lunch to over 252,000 children in 100% of Osun's elementary schools. In addition to staples such as rice, beans, and yams served with stews, soups, and vegetables, the programme provides daily fruits. Its estimated cost is N50 (USD $0.31) per child per day.\n\nAccording to a report on O'Meals' benefits:\n\nAll food items are sourced locally from farmers and others on the supply chain, enhancing employment within the state. Addressing child malnutrition has raised students' academic performance, and has increased school enrollment by 24% compared to figures from before April 2012.\n\nIn 2015, the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress (APC) advocated for the adoption of a nationwide free meal plan. Since he became President, Muhammadu Buhari has made the implementation of this policy one of his foremost priorities. A national School Meals programme is the subject of a budgetary proposal before the National Assembly. Also, the government of Kaduna State has implemented a school feeding programme.\n\nThe Healthy Kids Association (previously The Healthy Kids School Canteen Association) is a not-for-profit, non-governmental, health promotion organization based in Sydney, Australia. It is a peak organisation for school canteens in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).\n\nIn Australia, many school canteens have returned to offering junk food, or pupils have started buying fast food outside their schools. The association has developed policies intended to counter these trends; in some schools, they have taken over providing school food.\n\nIn response to the 2002 Childhood Obesity Summit, former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr launched the \"Fresh Tastes NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy.\" Healthy Kids has become a key partner of the Ministry of Health in developing this plan. The strategy is to develop a taste for healthier foods among schoolchildren by promoting and featuring healthier menu options, while limiting the availability of less nutritious foods. The program's menu guide was partially created by Rosemary Stanton.\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}

A bear claw is usually filled with almond paste, and sometimes raisins, and often shaped in a semicircle with slices along the curved edge, or rectangular with partial slices along one side. As the dough rises, the sections separate, evoking the shape of a bear's toes, hence the name.\n\nThe name \"bear claw\" as used for a pastry is first attested in 1936. The phrase is more common in Western American English, and is included in the U.S. Regional Dialect Survey Results, Question #87, \"Do you use the term 'bear claw' for a kind of pastry?\"\n\nA bear claw can be made by hand or by machine. A 1948 patent describes the process of assembling the bear claw as rolling out the dough, layering filling onto it, folding the dough over, cutting small incisions to create the claw-like look, and finally cutting the dough into separate pastries. The pastry can be curved into a half-circle at this point, which causes the \"toes\" to separate.\n\n"}

{"id": "2001690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001690", "title": "Hoe (food)", "text": "Hoe (food)\n\nHoe () refers to several varieties of raw food dishes in Korean cuisine.\n\nThere are uncooked \"hoe\" () as well as blanched \"sukhoe\" ().\n\n\"Hoe\" (), the raw fish or meat dish, can be divided into \"saengseon-hoe\" (), filleted raw fish, and \"yukhoe\" (), sliced raw meat. \"Saengseon-hoe\" () can be either \"hwareo-hoe\" () made from freshly killed fish, or \"seoneo-hoe\" () made using aged fish. \"Mulhoe\" () is a cold raw fish soup.\n\n\"Sukhoe\" () is a blanched fish, seafood, meat, or vegetable dish. \"Ganghoe\" () is a dish of rolled and tied ribbons made with blanched vegetables such as water dropworts and scallions.\n\n\"Hwareo-hoe\" () is prepared by filleting freshly killed fish, while \"seoneo-hoe\" () is made with aged fish in a similar way as Japanese \"sashimi\": removing the blood and innards and ageing the fish at a certain temperature before filleting. Fish or seafood \"hoe\" is often served with gochujang-based dipping sauces, such as \"cho-gochujang\" (chili paste mixed with vinegar) and \"ssamjang\" (chili paste mixed with soybean paste). Hoe is often eaten wrapped in \"ssam\" (wrap) vegetables, such as lettuce and perilla leaves. After eating \"hoe\" at a restaurant, \"maeun-tang\" (spicy fish stew) made with the bones, head, and the remaining meat of the fish, can be served as an add-on dish.\n\nHistorians assume the tradition of eating \"hoe\" was imported from China to Korea early in the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BC-668 AD), facilitated by frequent exchanges between China and Korea on the Korean peninsula. According to the Confucian \"Analects\", written in the 1st century BC, Confucius said, \"Do not shun rice that is well clean; do not shun \"kuai\" that is thinly sliced\" (食不厭精，膾不厭細). While the term \"kuai\" () originally referred to finely sliced raw fish or other meats such as beef or lamb, since the Qing and Han Dynasties it has referred mainly to raw fish.\n\nWith the popularization of Buddhism in Korea, beginning in the middle of the Three Kingdoms Period, and running late into the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392), the consumption of fish and other meat products (including \"hoe\") declined. As the influence of Buddhism waned in the late Goryeo Dynasty period, the consumption of \"hoe\" began to lose its stigma.\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, the state promoted Confucianism, and, as Confucius was known to have enjoyed eating raw meat, \"hoe\" consumption greatly increased.\n\nToday, the consumption of raw meat or seafood in Chinese cuisine is rare outside of a few regions, such as Chaozhou where dishes such as \"yusheng\" are popular.\n\n"}

In medieval cuisine, sops were very common; they were served with broth, soup or wine, salt water and then picked apart into smaller pieces to soak in the liquid. At elaborate feasts, bread was often pre-cut into finger-sized pieces rather than broken off by the diners themselves. The bread or croutons traditionally served with French onion soup, which took its current form in the 18th century, can be considered modern-day sops.\n\nThe word \"soup\" is a cognate of \"sop\", both stemming ultimately from the same Germanic source. The word is mentioned prominently in the Bible, King James Version (emphasis added):\nIn 19th century Australia, \"sop\" referred to a dish consisting of stale damper, soaked in cold tea and served with a dollop of jam on top for taste. This was mainly used in prisons and poor-houses, as well as institutions such as asylums. \"Sop\" colloquially stood for \"shit-on-plate\" and was not a desirable dish to be served.\n\nIn Portuguese, the word \"sopa\", among other meanings, can generally refer to soup or, particularly in Alentejo, to a piece of dry or even stale bread that is part of the traditional fish broth. The \"sopa\" is soaked in the broth and eaten.\n\nThe expression \"milksop\" describes a person as weak and indecisive. Its connotation is similar to that of \"milquetoast\".\n\nThe term \"supper\" derives from \"sop\", and the expression \"toast of the town\" derives from the practices of dipping spiced toasted bread into liquid, and of honoring a dinner guest by referring to him or her by that term, which implies he or she adds spice to the dinner party.\n\n"}

{"id": "2002934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002934", "title": "Moving Day (Quebec)", "text": "Moving Day (Quebec)\n\nMoving Day () is a tradition, but not a legal requirement, in the province of Quebec, Canada, dating from the time when the province used to mandate fixed terms for leases of rental properties. It falls on July 1, which is also Canada Day.\n\nThe tradition began as a humanitarian measure of the French colonial government of New France, who forbade \"seigneurs\", the semi-feudal landlords of the \"seigneuries\", from evicting their tenant farmers before the winter snows had melted.. Historian Yvon Desloges notes that it was common to move in the spring in the 18th century, citing a 1750 bylaw by Intendant François Bigot. Additionally, Jean-Philippe Warren, a sociologist at Concordia University in Montreal, noted in a 2013 interview for \"The New York Times\" that French law in the 18th century set May 1 as the starting date for all legal agreements, including leases.\n\nLater, this evolved into a requirement that urban leases begin on May 1 and end on April 30. In law, this date was set in the Civil Code of Lower Canada of 1866. May 1 thus became \"Moving Day\", the day during which renters who wished to vacate their current premises physically changed domiciles.\n\nIn 1973, the Quebec government decided that it would be better to move Moving Day to the summer. This measure would allow children, especially the ones in primary school to complete their full year at the same establishment. Also, by moving the date to a holiday, workers would not have to sacrifice a working day. This argument was strong for the tenants rights groups representing the average poorer class. Moreover, they moved the date from May 1st to July 1 because of the tendency for rough weather in early May. The law repealed sections of the Civil code setting fixed terms for leases as of 1974, but mandated a two-month lengthening of leases for following year as a transitory measure. However, tradition has held sway, and the vast majority of leases are still a year long and begin around July 1. In 2004, approximately 120,000 households moved on or around July 1, corresponding to 4% of the population. In 2013, the government of Montreal estimated that about 115,000 city residents moved each year, or about 7% of the city's 1.6 million people.\n\nIn the aforementioned interview, Warren added sociological reasons why July 1 has persisted as Moving Day. He noted that Francophone Quebecers move much more frequently than other Canadians, but generally stay in their old neighbourhoods, with some moving only across the street. According to Warren, a higher frequency of moves in the Francophone community makes a standard moving date more convenient for people changing their residences. As he put it, \"They are constantly on the move, but they don’t go anywhere.\"\n\nMoving Day is a boon and a headache for commercial moving companies, and people must reserve their services in advance, more than six months before moving day in some cases. During this period, moving companies work around the clock, with moving charges often being three times the normal rate. The short supply of movers in Montreal inspired entrepreneurs to offer a \"green\" moving service featuring heavy-duty bicycle trailers.\n\nIn Montreal, where only 38% of residents own their home, Moving Day is particularly busy and has been described as \"a kind of moving madness\". Exterior staircases leading up to second, third, or even fourth-storey apartments are common in many neighbourhoods, in part because historically this reduced the size of buildings and therefore decreased the owner's property taxes. These staircases are often narrow, curved, and metal – not ideal for nonprofessionals carrying major appliances. According to \"New York Times\" writer Ian Austen, \"unlike apartments in the rest of Canada, the ones here [in Montreal] rarely come with kitchen appliances, adding to the movers’ burdens.\" Cities also schedule extra garbage and recycling pickups for this period to deal with unwanted furniture and empty boxes left beside the road. According to Hydro-Québec, more than 700,000 Quebec households moved in 2009, including 225,000 on the island of Montreal.\n\nThe July 1 date of Moving Day also somewhat reduces the significance of Canada Day as a public holiday in Quebec, as many who might otherwise attend holiday festivities are occupied by moving. Suggestions that the move was a deliberate decision by Quebec sovereigntists to discourage participation in a patriotic Canadian holiday ignore the fact that the change in date from May 1 to July 1 was the result of a bill introduced by a federalist MNA, Jérôme Choquette of the Quebec Liberal Party.\n\nAlthough moving day is seen as a headache for most people, Montreal-based columnist Josée Legault sees a few positive aspects in the annual festival, pointing out that July 1 occurs at the end of the school year, not two months before as was the case before the 1970s. Bargain hunters —especially people who don't move— also enjoy the numerous garage sales occurring before moving day and the common practice of leaving behind slightly used furniture and appliances on the curb side or in the alley, in effect giving them to anyone in need.\n\nThe annual ritual has also been translated in Quebec's literature, music and cinema. Gabrielle Roy's classic novel \"Bonheur d'occasion\" describes the traditional frenzy surrounding Moving Day in the working-class borough of Saint-Henri in Montreal.\n\nQuebec film director Philippe Gagnon used the yearly occurrence as the setting for \"\", a 2004 light-hearted comedy featuring three households caught in the turmoil of Moving Day.\n\n"}

The word has long been used by Jewish-Americans and in the regional speech of New York City and elsewhere. It is Slavic in origin.\n\nThe word may also refer to free promotional items dispensed at trade shows, conventions, and similar commercial events. They can also be sold as cheap souvenirs in tourist areas, which are sometimes called \"tchotchke shops\".\n\nA wide variety of spellings exist for the English usage of the term, e.g., \"tshotshke\", \"tshatshke\", \"tchachke\", \"tchotchka\", \"tchatchka\", \"chachke\", \"tsotchke\", \"chotski\", or \"chochke\"; the standard Yiddish transliteration is \"tsatske\" or \"tshatshke\". In YIVO standard orthography, it is spelled טשאַטשקע. In Israeli Hebrew it is often spelled , , with a tsade instead of teth-shin, as in Yiddish. A Hebrew variant is צ׳אצ׳קע, using צ (tsade) with a single apostrophe (usually called a chupchik, or geresh in more formal parlance).\n\nDepending on context, the term has a connotation of worthlessness or disposability as well as tackiness.\n\nA common confusion is between the terms \"tchotchke\" and \"tsatske\" or rather \"tsatskele\", with the diminutive ending -le. Both terms have the same Slavic root, but the tch- version stems from Russian, while the ts- originates in Polish. \"Tchotchke\" usually references trinkets, while \"tsatskele\" is more likely to mean a young girl or woman who uses her charms in order to reach her goals. Being Yiddish, the meaning can change by the use of gestures and a change in tone, so that \"tsatskele\" can become the favorite child.\n\nLeo Rosten, author of \"The Joys of Yiddish\", combines the two main meanings and gives an alternate sense of \"tchotchke\" as meaning a desirable young girl, a \"pretty young thing\". Less flatteringly, the term could be construed as a more dismissive synonym for \"bimbo\", or \"slut\".\n\nThe word \"tchotchke\" derives from a Slavic word for \"trinket\" (, ; ; , , , \"tsatski\" )—adapted to Yiddish Sg. , ('trinket').\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2003602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003602", "title": "Gordita", "text": "Gordita\n\nA gordita () in Mexican cuisine is a pastry made with masa and stuffed with cheese, meat, or other fillings. It is similar to a pasty and to the Colombian/Venezuelan arepa. \"Gordita\" means \"chubby\" in Spanish. There are two main variations of this dish, one which is typically fried in a deep wok-shaped comal, consumed mostly in central and southern Mexico, and another one baked on a regular comal. The most common and representative variation of this dish is the \"\"gordita de chicharrón\"\", filled with chicharron (a spiced stew of pork rind) which is widely consumed throughout Mexico. Gorditas are often eaten as a lunch meal and accompanied by several types of sauce.\n\nA gordita is typically prepared as a thick tortilla. The dough is most commonly made of nixtamalized corn flour, as also used for tortillas, but can also be of wheat flour, particularly in northern Mexico close to the U.S border. An old variant of corn gorditas uses \"masa quebrada\" (broken dough) where the corn meal is coarsely ground, leaving bits of broken grain. \n\nIn the deep fried version, once the masa has been prepared, it is separated in small portions, then each one is filled with meat, and shaped as an oblong disc. The Pastry is immersed in boiled oil until golden and crispy on the outside. After cooking, the gordita is allowed to stand to drain excess oil, then a small slit is cut into one side to allow vapor and excessive heat to release and pour lime juice and salsa inside, which gives the gordita its characteristic flavor. In some regions of Mexico, the slit is also used to stuff additional ingredients, mostly dressings such as fresh cheese, nopal salad, tomatoes, guacamole, potatoes, beans or rajas (sautéed strips of chile). By tradition, gorditas are filled with chicharron, but there are local variations which substitute it by chicken stew, shredded beef, carne al pastor, eggs with chorizo sausage, carnitas or picadillo. \n\nThe baked version is prepared almost identically to the preparation of a common tortilla, except it is thicker. When the masa is prepared, chicharrón is mixed directly in the dough, instead of being added later. Shaped as a flat circle, then it is placed in a comal until cooked, in most cases not adding additional oil. When slit and filled, this gordita looks like a sandwich made with tortillas instead of bread. This variation is known as \"Gordita de migas\".\n\nIn central Mexico, gorditas commonly range from being relatively small, but bulky (about the size of a child's fist), to about the diameter of a \"regular\" tortilla. In northern Mexico they tend to be larger and flatter.\n\nIn most cases gorditas are shallow-fried with vegetable oil in a deep comal, but they can also be deep-fried, making the outside more crisp.\n\nIn Durango and others states of Northern Mexico, gorditas are commonly made from wheat flour and look like small pita breads. The dough (masa) is identical to that of a wheat flour tortilla. It is cooked on a comal with a hot piece of metal placed on top that resembles a clothes iron. The gordita fills with steam, and a small slit is cut into one side where it can be filled with guisados.\n\n\nThe fast food restaurant chain Taco Bell offers a wheat flour gordita that has limited similarity to gorditas as served in Mexico and is more akin to a pita bread taco.\n\nIn eastern and central Mexico \"gorditas de nata\" (cream gorditas) are consumed often as a breakfast dish or snack. It is a sweet cake similar to a tiny but extremely thick pancake made with milk cream or clotted cream, called \"nata\" in Mexico, cinnamon, sugar and white wheat flour. They are named \"gordita\" too, due to their appearance, similar to the original fried gordita, but their taste is sweet, not salty. Besides their appearance, this snack is not related to the original one. The same flour preparation used to prepare gorditas de nata is also used to cook a flat cookie variation, which by extension it is also named \"gordita\", but in contrast, it is thin and crispy, not thick. To differentiate it, these flat cookies are named \"sugar gorditas\" instead.\n\n"}
{"id": "2003927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2003927", "title": "Fondant icing", "text": "Fondant icing\n\nFondant icing, also commonly referred to simply as fondant (, ), is an icing used to decorate or sculpt cakes and pastries. It is made from sugar, water, gelatin, vegetable fat or shortening, and glycerol. It does not have the texture of most icings; rolled fondant is akin to stiff clay, while poured fondant is a thick liquid. The word, in French, means \"melting,\" coming from the same root as \"fondue\" and \"foundry.\" However, what the French call \"fondant\" is sugar glaze, which has to be applied hot on pastries like \"mille-feuille,\" while fondant icing would be referred as \"pâte à sucre,\" meaning \"sugar dough.\"\n\n\"Poured fondant\" is a creamy confection used as a filling or coating for cakes, pastries, and candies or sweets.\nIn its simplest form, it is sugar and water stabilized with gelatin and glycerine. It is cooked to the soft-ball stage, cooled slightly, and stirred or beaten to incorporate air, until it is an opaque mass with a creamy consistency. Sometimes lemon or vanilla is added to the mixture for taste. Other flavorings are used as well, as are various colorings. An example of its use is the Cadbury Creme Egg, the filling of which is inverted sugar syrup, produced by processing fondant with invertase. Fondant fancies are a type of cake typically coated in poured fondant.\n\n\"Rolled fondant,\" \"fondant icing,\" or \"pettinice,\" which is not the same material as poured fondant, is commonly used to decorate wedding cakes. Although wedding cakes are traditionally made with marzipan and royal icing, fondant is increasingly common due to nut allergies as it does not require almond meal. Rolled fondant includes gelatin (or agar in vegetarian recipes) and food-grade glycerine, which keeps the sugar pliable and creates a dough-like consistency. It can also be made using powdered sugar and melted marshmallows. Rolled fondant is rolled out like a pie crust and used to cover the cake.\n\nWhen applying rolled fondant to a cake, it's best to have the thickness at approximately 1/8\". Although 1/8\" is standard, certain cakes and decorations require varying levels of fondant. It is possible to color rolled fondant, to create the desired color of the designer. It is recommended to wear gloves and use gel color when changing the color of fondant.\n\nCommercial shelf-stable rolled fondant often consists principally of sugar and hydrogenated oil. However, different formulations for commercial shelf-stable fondant are available and include other ingredients, such as sugar, cellulose gum, and water.\n\n\"Marshmallow fondant\" is a form of rolled fondant often made and used by home bakers and hobbyists. Marshmallow fondant is made by combining melted shelf-stable marshmallows, water, powered sugar, and solid vegetable shortening. Home bakers use this recipe for homemade fondant due to the readily available access to required ingredients. \n\n\"Sculpting fondant\" is similar to rolled fondant but with a stiffer consistency, which makes it a good sculpting material.\n\n\"Sugar paste\" or \"gum paste\" is similar to rolled fondant, but hardens completely—and therefore is used for bigger cake decorations, such as bride and groom figures, bigger flowers, etc. Sugar paste is made mainly of egg whites, powdered sugar, and shortening. Tylose can be added to make gum paste more pliable for detailed work.\n\nPoured fondant is formed by supersaturating water with sucrose. More than twice as much sugar dissolves in water at the boiling point as at room temperature. After the sucrose dissolves, if the solution is left to cool undisturbed, the sugar remains dissolved in a supersaturated solution until nucleation occurs. While the solution is supersaturated, if a cook puts a seed crystal (undissolved sucrose) into the mix, or agitates the solution, the dissolved sucrose crystallizes to form large, crunchy crystals (which is how rock candy is made). However, if the cook lets the solution cool undisturbed and then stirs it vigorously, it forms many tiny crystals, resulting in a smooth-textured fondant.\n\n"}

In English, some bakers have adopted the French spelling of \"macaron\" for the meringue-based item to distinguish the two. In a \"Slate\" article on the topic, Stanford professor of linguistics and computer science Daniel Jurafsky describes how the two confections have a shared history, also shared with macaroni (Italian ). Prof. Jurafsky notes that French words ending with \"-on\" that were borrowed into English in the 16th and 17th centuries are usually spelled with \"-oon\" (for example: \"balloon\", \"cartoon\", \"platoon\"). In the UK, many bakeries continue to use the term \"macaroon\".\n\nA typical macaron is presented with a ganache, buttercream or jam filling sandwiched between two such cookies, akin to a sandwich cookie. The confection is characterized by a smooth squared top, a ruffled circumference—referred to as the \"crown\" or \"foot\" (or \"pied\")—and a flat base. It is mildly moist and easily melts in the mouth. Macarons can be found in a wide variety of flavors that range from traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha).\n\nMacarons have been produced in the Venetian monasteries since the 8th century A.D. During the Renaissance, French queen Catherine de' Medici's Italian pastry chefs made them when she brought them with her to France in 1533 upon marrying Henry II of France. According to \"Larousse Gastronomique\" the macaron was created in 1791 in a convent near Cormery. In 1792, macarons began to gain fame when two Carmelite nuns, seeking asylum in Nancy during the French Revolution, baked and sold the macaron cookies in order to pay for their housing. These nuns became known as the \"Macaron Sisters\". In these early stages, macarons were served without special flavors or fillings.\n\nIt was not until the 1930s that macarons began to be served two-by-two with the addition of jams, liqueurs, and spices. The macaron as it is known today, composed of two almond meringue discs filled with a layer of buttercream, jam, or ganache filling, was originally called the \"Gerbet\" or the \"Paris macaron.\" Pierre Desfontaines, of the French pâtisserie Ladurée, has sometimes been credited with its creation in the early part of the 20th century, but another baker, Claude Gerbet, also claims to have invented it. French macaron bakeries became trendy in North America in the 2010s.\n\nMany Italian cookbooks of the 16th century mention almond biscuits closely resembling macarons albeit under different names. The earliest known recipe dated back from the early 17th century and appears to be inspired by a French version of the recipe.\n\nThere are two main methods to making a macaron - the \"French\" method and the \"Italian\" method. The difference between the two is the way the meringue is made.\n\nIn the French method, egg whites are whisked until a stiff-peaked meringue forms. From there, sifted, ground almonds and powdered sugar are folded in slowly until the desired consistency is reached. This process of knocking out air and folding is called macaronage.\n\nThe Italian method involves whisking the egg whites with a hot sugar syrup to form a meringue. Sifted almonds and icing sugar are also mixed with raw egg whites to form a paste. The meringue and almond paste are mixed together to form the macaron mixture. This method is often deemed more structurally sound yet also sweeter and also requires a candy thermometer for the sugar syrup.\n\nEither Italian or French meringue can be combined with ground almonds.\n\nA macaron is made by combining icing sugar and ground almonds into a fine mixture. In a separate bowl, egg whites are beaten to a meringue-like consistency. The two elements are then folded together until they are the consistency of \"shaving foam\", and then are piped, left to form a skin, and baked. Sometimes, a filling is added.\n\nSeveral French cities and regions claim long histories and variations, notably Lorraine (Nancy and Boulay), Basque Country (Saint-Jean-de-Luz), Saint-Émilion, Amiens, Montmorillon, Le Dorat, Sault, Chartres, Cormery, Joyeuse and Sainte-Croix in Burgundy.\nMacarons d'Amiens, made in Amiens, are small, round-shaped biscuit-type macarons made from almond paste, fruit and honey, which were first recorded in 1855.\n\nThe city of Montmorillon is well known for its macarons and has a museum dedicated to it. The Maison Rannou-Métivier is the oldest macaron bakery in Montmorillon, dating back to 1920. The traditional recipe for Montmorillon macarons remains unchanged for over 150 years.\n\nThe town of Nancy in the Lorraine region has a storied history with the macaron. It is said that the abbess of Remiremont founded an order of nuns called the \"Dames du Saint-Sacrement\" with strict dietary rules prohibiting the consumption of meat. Two nuns, Sisters Marguerite and Marie-Elisabeth are credited with creating the Nancy macaron to fit their dietary requirements. They became known as the 'Macaron Sisters' (Les Soeurs Macarons). In 1952, the city of Nancy honored them by giving their name to the Rue de la Hache, where the macaron was invented.\n\nMacarons in Japan are a popular confection known as マカロン (\"makaron\"). There is also another widely available version of \"makaron\" which substitutes peanut flour for almond and a wagashi-style flavouring. The \"makaron\" is featured in Japanese fashion through cell phone accessories, stickers, and cosmetics aimed towards women.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Luxemburgerli (also Luxembourger) is a brand name of confectionery made by the Confiserie Sprüngli in Zürich, Switzerland. A Luxemburgerli is a macaron comprising two disks of almond meringue with a buttercream filling. Luxemburgerli are smaller and lighter than macarons from many other vendors.\n\nFlavors of macarons available in America are available in respect to the general tastes of the public. These include flavors such as mint chocolate chip, peanut butter and jelly, snickers, peach champagne, pistachio, strawberry cheesecake, candy corn, salted pretzel, chocolate peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, candy cane, cinnamon, maple bacon, pumpkin, and salted caramel popcorn.\n\nIn Paris, the Ladurée chain of pastry shops has been known for its macarons for about .\n\nIn Portugal, Australia, France and Belgium, McDonald's sells macarons in their McCafés (sometimes using advertising that likens the shape of a macaron to that of a hamburger). McCafé macarons are produced by Château Blanc, which, like Ladurée, is a subsidiary of Groupe Holder, though they do not use the same macaron recipe.\n\nOutside of Europe, the French-style macaron can be found in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn Australia, Adriano Zumbo, along with his TV series \"MasterChef\", have contributed to the macaron becoming a popular sweet treat, and it is now sold by McDonald's in its Australian McCafe outlets.\n\n\n\n"}

The main ingredient is a leaf vegetable, traditionally either amaranth (known by many local names, including \"callaloo\", but not Spinach or \"bhaaji\"), taro (known by many local names, including \"dasheeen bush\", \"callaloo bush\", \"callaloo\", or \"bush\") or \"Xanthosoma\" (known by many names, including \"coco\" & \"tannia)\". Because the leaf vegetable used in some regions may be locally called \"callaloo\" or \"callaloo bush\" \"Dasheen Leaves\", some confusion can arise among the vegetables and with the dish itself. In Haiti, for example, the creole word \"kalalou\" refers to okra, and not to a leafy green. Outside of the Caribbean, water spinach is occasionally used. Trinidadians, Grenadians and Dominicans primarily use taro/dasheen bush for callaloo, although Dominicans also use water spinach. Jamaicans, Belizeans and Guyanese on the other hand use the name callaloo to refer to amaranth, and use it in a plethora of dishes and also a drink ('callaloo juice'). The 'callaloo' made in Jamaica is different from the 'callaloo' made in Trinidad and Tobago Grenada and rest of the Caribbean in terms of main ingredient (the leaf used) and other ingredients included (for example, Jamaicans tend to use only callaloo leaf, tomatoes, salt, peppers, onions, and scallions, and simply steam the vegetable, while Trinidadians use Callaloo leaves/ dasheen bush, ochro ,coconut milk, pumpkin, onions, bell peppers, local seasonings and spices along with crabs or pigtails to make a different richer dish with a totally different taste and consistency). \"callaloo\" in Trinidad is used in a variety of dishes including Callaloo soup \"callaloo bhaji\" two Trinidads specialities. Callaloo is the National Dish of the twin Island Republic of Trinidad and the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n\n\nCallaloo in Trinidad & Tobago and other eastern Caribbean countries is generally made with okra and dasheen or water spinach \"Ipomoea aquatica\". There are many variations of callaloo which may include coconut milk, crab, conch, Caribbean lobster, meats, pumpkin, chili peppers, and other seasonings such as chopped onions and garlic. The ingredients are added and simmered down to a somewhat stewlike consistency. When done, callaloo is dark green in colour and is served as a side dish which may be used as a gravy for other food.\n\nCallaloo is widely known throughout the Caribbean and has a distinctively Caribbean origin, created by enslaved Africans using ideas of the indigenous people along with both African (okra) and indigenous (\"Xanthosoma\") plants. (See Palaver sauce for the West African dish.). Trinidadians have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish, for Trinidadians, Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra.\n\nIn Jamaica, callaloo is often combined with saltfish and is usually seasoned with tomatoes, onion, escallion, scotch bonnet peppers and margarine/cooking oil and steamed. It is often eaten with roasted breadfruit, boiled green bananas and dumplings and it is a popular breakfast dish.\n\nIn Grenada, callaloo is steamed with garlic, onion and coconut milk and often eaten as a side dish. Grenadians also stir or blend the mixture until it has a smooth consistent texture. Callaloo soup comprising callaloo, okra (optional), dumplings, ground provision like yam, potato (sweet and \"Irish\") chicken and beef is traditionally eaten on Saturdays. It is also one of the most important ingredient in Oil Down, the Island's National Dish comprising steamed breadfruit, callaloo, dumplings, ground provision, carrot and several varieties of meat--salt fish, chicken, pork. All of this is steamed in coconut milk and saffron powder. Salt and pepper is added. Due to the high iron content of callaloo, Grenadians douse it down with a fruit drink high in Vitamin C especially as Iron could only be absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C. \n\nIn the Virgin Islands, callaloo is served with a dish of fungee on the side.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, \"calalou au crabe\" (crab callaloo) is a traditional Easter dish.\n\nA similar variation is the recipe called \"Laing\" which is popular in the Philippines, mainly the Bicol region.\n\n\n"}

It does not provide any benefit beyond that of sugar pills. It is a popular preparation, particularly in France. It is manufactured by Boiron, its sole manufacturer. Oscillococcinum is used in more than 50 countries and has been in production for over 65 years.\n\nThe preparation is derived from duck liver and heart, diluted to 200C—a ratio of one part duck offal to 10 parts water. Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an \"imprint\" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo.\n\nOscillococcinum was originally proposed by the French physician Joseph Roy, based on his misidentification of an oscillating bacterium he named \"oscillococcus\" in victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917-1918. Roy said he had seen the same bacterium in cancer sufferers, and proposed a homeopathic preparation (which he claimed to have isolated in a duck) as a remedy for the Spanish flu. The microbes Roy said he saw have never been independently observed by any other researcher. In addition, it is now known that influenza is caused by a virus and not a bacterium.\n\nThe word \"Oscillococcinum\" was coined by the French physician Joseph Roy (1891–1978) in his 1925 book \"Towards Knowledge and the Cure of Cancer\". Roy wrote that while on military duty during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917 he had observed an oscillating bacterium in the blood of flu victims, which he named \"Oscillococcus\".\n\nRoy subsequently claimed to have observed the microbe in the blood of patients that had viral diseases like herpes, chicken pox, and shingles. He thought it to be the causative agent of diseases as varied as eczema, rheumatism, tuberculosis, measles, and cancer. Roy searched for the \"bacterium\" in several animals until he felt that he had found it on the liver of a Long Island duckling. Believing he had also detected it in the blood of cancer patients, he tried a vaccine-like therapy on them, which was unsuccessful. \n\nThe microbe has never been independently observed by another researcher, and it remains unclear what, if anything, Roy actually saw. Moreover, medical science has since disproved Roy's \"universal germ\" theory: rheumatism, for example, is not caused by bacteria, and measles is caused by a virus far too small for Roy to have observed in his optical microscope. \n\nThe modern preparation is created from the heart and liver of Muscovy duck (see the preparation section for the details). \n\nIn France, the selling of all products manufactured according to the Korsakovian principle of dilution was forbidden until 1992, with the exception of Oscillo, thanks to a special measure made for it. , Oscillococcinum was one of the top ten selling drugs in France, was publicised widely in the media, and was being prescribed for both flu and the common cold. As of 2008 it sells US$15 million per year in the U.S., and it also sells widely in Europe.\n\nThe ingredients of a one-gram tube of Oscillococcinum are listed as follows:\n\n\nThe 200CK indicates that the preparation entails a series of 200 dilutions of the starting ingredient, an extract from the heart and liver of a Muscovy duck. Each step entails a 1:100 dilution, where the first mixture contains 1% of the extract, the second contains 1% of the first mixture, etc. The K indicates that it is prepared by the Korsakovian method, in which rather than 1% of the preparation being measured out at each stage and then diluted, a single vessel is repeatedly emptied, refilled, and vigorously shaken (in homeopathic terminology \"succussed\"), and it is assumed that 1% remains in the vessel each time. The 200C dilution is so extreme that the final pill contains none of the original material.\n\nOscillococcinum is generally considered harmless. When Boiron (the company that makes oscillococcinum) spokeswoman Gina Casey was asked if a product made from the heart and liver of a duck was safe, she replied: \"Of course it is safe. There's nothing in it.\"\n\nThere is no compelling scientific evidence that Oscillococcinum has any effect beyond placebo. None of its active ingredient is present in a dose of the final product, nor is there any credible evidence that duck liver is effective in relieving (or causing) flu symptoms in the first place. Homeopaths claim the diluted molecules leave an \"imprint\" in the remedy, but there is no known mechanism for how this could occur. Homeopathy as a whole is considered to be pseudoscience.\n\nAs Robert L. Park, a critic of alternative medicine, explains, some of the characteristics of flu may suggest that Oscillococcinum works. Since the flu normally goes away on its own in a variable number of days, the natural course of the disease is a potential source of error in assessing the efficacy of any intervention: if one takes any medication, and then one's flu goes away, there is a tendency to attribute this to the medication even though the infection would have resolved anyway. Someone who gets over a mild strain of flu may attribute the mildness to the efficacy of the homeopathic preparation and not to the fact that it was a mild strain, and might recommend it to other people, spreading its popularity. Also, the most likely explanation for its effectiveness with flu symptoms is that patients are misdiagnosing the symptoms of several rhinovirus diseases or of allergies to several hundred substances, and attributing them to a flu infection that they do not have.\n\nA 2005 review of flu treatments (vaccine, medicine, homeopathy) has concluded that the popularity of Oscillococcinum in France was unsupported by any evidence of efficacy.\n\nIn a 2007 review, the effectiveness of non-mainstream remedies against seasonal flu could not be established beyond reasonable doubt, and the evidence is found to be sparse and limited by \"small sample sizes, low methodological quality, or clinically irrelevant effect sizes\", and that the results strengthen using conventional approaches for flu.\n\nA Cochrane review published in December 2015 found that there was insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about whether Oscillococcinum is useful for influenza.\n\nThe non-profit, educational organizations Center for Inquiry (CFI) and the associated Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) have petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), criticizing Boiron for misleading labeling and advertising of Oscillococcinum. \"One petition complains that Boiron’s packaging for Oscillococcinum lists the alleged active ingredient – duck liver and heart – in Latin only. Another petition complains that Boiron’s web ad for this product implies that it has received FDA approval.\" Ronald Lindsay, CFI and CSI president and chief executive officer, contends, \"If Boiron is going to sell snake oil, the least they can do is use English on their labels.”\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed against Boiron on behalf of \"all California residents who purchased Oscillo at any time within the past four years.\" The lawsuit charges that Boiron \"falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu because it contains an active ingredient it claims is proven to get rid of flu symptoms in 48 hours.\" The lawsuit also states that the listed active ingredient in Oscillococcinum (Oscillo) \"is actually Muscovy Duck Liver and Heart ... and has no known medicinal quality.\" A settlement was reached, with Boiron denying any wrongdoing and agreeing to make several changes to its marketing of the product. These changes include adding to their packaging notices like \"These ‘Uses’ have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration\" and \"C, K, CK, and X are homeopathic dilutions.\"\n\nSince 2011, at least two class action lawsuits on behalf of customers who purchased Oscillococcinum have been filed against Boiron in the United States, alleging that Boiron falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu. A proposed settlement was reached in August 2012. While the settlement was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by one class member who opposed the settlement, on February 24, 2015 the Ninth Circuit issued a decision upholding approval of the class action settlement.\n\nBoiron's legal threats against Samuele Riva for writing criticisms on his website were rebuffed by his web hosting company, and the debacle was described as producing a Streisand effect against Boiron.\n\n"}

Serbian law bans production and import of genetically modified food (GMO), which has caused a long-running dispute with the World Trade Organization, preventing the country from becoming a member of the organization.\n\nThe national dishes include pljeskavica (a ground beef/pork patty), ćevapi (grilled ground meat), and Karađorđeva šnicla (Karageorge's schnitzel). The national drink is the plum brandy šljivovica or homemade rakija . \n\nWith Serbia being located on the crossroads between East and West, its cuisine has gathered elements from different cooking styles across the Middle East and Europe to develop its own hearty gastronomy with an intricate balance of rich meats, vegetables, cheese, fresh pastries and desserts. It has much in common with the cuisines of neighboring Balkan countries, as well as, to a smaller extent, the cuisines of countries as far north as Germany and as far east as Iran and Pakistan. Its flavours are mild, fresh and natural. Seasonings are light, while ingredients are fresh and of good quality. Eating seasonal food is very important, and many dishes are strongly associated with a specific time of the year.\n\nMost people in Serbia will have three meals a day , breakfast, lunch and dinner, lunch being the largest. However, traditionally, only lunch and dinner existed, with breakfast being introduced in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nA number of foods which are usually bought in the West are often made at home in Serbia. These include rakija (fruit brandy), slatko, jam, jelly, various pickled foods, notably sauerkraut, ajvar or sausages. The reasons for this range from economical to cultural. Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition.\n\nWilliam, archbishop of Tyre, who visited Constantinople in 1179, described the Serbs: \"\"They are rich in herds and flocks and unusually well supplied with milk, cheese, butter, meat, honey and wax\"\".\n\nThe first published cookbook in Serbia is The Big Serbian Cookbook (\"Велики српски кувар\"), written by Katarina Popović-Midzina in 1877.\n\nThe best known Serbian cookbook is Pata's Cookbook (\"Патин кувар\"), written by Spasenija Pata Marković in 1907; the book remains in publication even today.\n\nAn old Serbian legend says that during the time of the 14th-century Serbian Empire, under the rule of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan, meals in the Serbian palace were eaten with golden spoons and forks. Historians say that mediaeval Serbian cuisine mainly consisted of milk, dairy produce and vegetables. Not a lot of bread was eaten, but when it was, the rich ate bread made from wheat and the poor ate bread made from oats and rye. The only meat consumed was game, with cattle kept for agricultural use.\n\nBreakfast in Serbia is an early but hearty meal, rich in calories and carbohydrates, meant to provide one with enough energy to start the day well. Bread is frequently eaten, served with butter, jam, yogurt, sour cream or cheese, accompanied by bacon, sausages, salami, eggs or kajmak. Many people would stop by a bakery in the morning to enjoy fresh pastries, such as pogačice, paštete, kifle (which in Serbian usage may or may not be crescent-shaped and may be sweet, but may also be sprinkled with salt crystals), kiflice, perece, buhtle, pletenice, štapići, zemičke, djevreci, mekike and uštipci. Other common breakfast dishes include burek, kačamak and cicvara (types of polenta), popara, proja (cornbread) and čalabrca. Before breakfast most people usually have a cup of coffee, or perhaps espresso. With the breakfast itself either a tea, milk, milk coffee, or chocolate milk is served.\n\nMeze is an assortment of small dishes and appetizers, though, unlike the Middle Eastern meze, it does not usually include cooked dishes, and is therefore more similar to Italian antipasto. A Serbian meze typically includes slices of cured meats and sausages, cheeses, olives, fresh vegetables and uršija. Meze is served either to accompany alcoholic drinks or as a starter before a soup on bigger meals.\n\nSoups are eaten as an entrée at almost every lunch. They are considered to be very important for good health. There are two types of soups in Serbian cuisine: thin soups called \"supa\", and thicker soups with roux or eggs called \"čorba\". The most common ones are simple pottages made of beef or poultry with added noodles. Lamb, veal and fish soups are considered delicacies.\n\nThe main course is most commonly a meat dish. Besides \"roštilj\" (barbecue) which is very popular, braising, stewing and roasting in an oven are the most common cooking methods. \nGrilling is very popular in Serbia. Grilled meats are the primary main course dishes offered in restaurants. They are commonly served as mixed grill on large oval plates. They are often also eaten as fast food. The city of Leskovac is especially famous for its barbecue.\n\nBread is the staple of Serbian meals and it is often treated almost ritually. A traditional Serbian welcoming is to offer the guest with bread and salt; bread also plays an important role in religious rituals. Many people believe that it is sinful to throw away bread regardless of how old it is. Although pasta, rice, potato and similar side dishes did enter the everyday cuisine over time, many Serbs still eat bread with meals.\n\nIn most bakeries and shops, white wheat bread loafs (typically 0.5 kg) are sold. In modern times, black bread and various graham bread variations regain popularity. In many rural households, bread is still baked in ovens, usually in bigger loafs.\n\nIn Serbia, salads are eaten as a side dish with the main course. The simplest of salads are made of sliced lettuce, cabbage, sauerkraut, tomato, cucumber or carrot with oil, vinegar and salt. Some, such as beetroot or potato salads, require cooking.\n\nDairy products are an important part of the Serbian diet. Fermented products such as sour milk, kajmak, yogurt and pavlaka are common breakfast foods, consumed daily. White cheese, called \"sir\" are much more common in Serbia than yellow cheeses. There are numerous varieties, some of which have been awarded for their quality, such as the white cheese with walnuts from Babine, which won the 2012 \"best autochtonic cheese\" award. Serbian Pule cheese, made from donkey milk, is the most expensive cheese in the world. Although less common, several yellow cheese are locally produced.\n\nEvery autumn or early winter, on an event called \"svinjokolj\" pigs are slaughtered and meat is dried in the cold air, cured and preserved for winter. Cured meats, bacon, salo, čvarci, Sausages such as krvavica and kulen are produced. Offal and cheaper cutts of meat are utilized as well, made into processed products such as švargla.\n\nIn Serbia, pies are very popular. They are eaten either for breakfast, dinner, or as a snack. Most commonly they are made with thin layers of phyllo dough. There are several preparation methods and numerous types of fillings, both sweet and savory. Usually, pies are named after either the preparation method, or the filling.\n\nOne pie variety that is not made with phyllo is the \"štrudla\", which, in turn, isn't similar to strudel, but rather to a nut roll.\n\nSweets are served at the end of meals. Sweets and desserts enjoyed in Serbia include both typically Middle Eastern and typically European ones, as well as some authentically Serbian ones. Besides the ones mentioned here, pies with sweet fruit fillings are also commonly eaten as desserts.\n\nDomestic coffee (or Turkish coffee) is the most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage in Serbia. It is mostly prepared at home, rather than bought in coffee shops, and preferably consumed in the company of friends or family. Slatko, ratluk and rakija may be served alongside coffee. The majority of the Serbian population starts a day with a cup of coffee in the morning. Herbal teas are consumed as a medication, rather than a beverage. Yogurt and kefir are commonly consumed dairy beverages. They frequently accompany savory pastries. A beverage made from maize, called boza, used to be popular in the past. Today it is rarely consumed.\n\nA number of fruit juice and mineral water brands are produced locally. The Knjaz Milos mineral water is considered a national brand.\n\nRakija is a general term for distilled beverages made from fruits. There are numerous varieties, which are usually named after the type of fruit they are made from. Comparatively many people brew their own rakija. Šljivovica, made from plum, is considered the national drink.\n\nBeer is widely enjoyed in Serbia. There are 14 breweries in the country.\n\nThere are nearly 70,000 hectares of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 425,000 tons of grapes annually. Despite that, Serbia still has little international recognition as a wine producer.\n\n\n"}

It is ubiquitous in West Virginia, particularly in convenience stores, and is arguably the food most closely associated with the state.\n\nThe classic pepperoni roll consists of a fairly soft white yeast bread roll with pepperoni baked in the middle. During baking, the fats in the pepperoni (which are hard at room temperature) melt, resulting in a spicy oil suffusing into the bread. Pepperoni rolls are typically eaten as a snack or as the main dish of a lunch either unheated or slightly warmed.\n\nIts history is documented in \"The West Virginia Pepperoni Roll\" book by Candace Nelson and published by WVU Press.\n\nThe pepperoni roll was first sold by Giuseppe \"Joseph\" Argiro at the Country Club Bakery in Fairmont, West Virginia, in 1927.\nThe rolls originated as a lunch option for the coal miners of north-central West Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. Pepperoni rolls do not need to be refrigerated for storage and could readily be packed for lunch by miners. Pepperoni and other Italian foods became popular in north-central West Virginia in the early 20th century, when the booming mines and railroads attracted many immigrants from Italy. The pepperoni roll bears a resemblance to the pasty and sausage roll, which originated in the mining communities of Great Britain, as well as the Italian calzone.\n\nVariations on the original pepperoni roll may contain different types of cheese, peppers, etc. The pepperoni within can take several forms, including a single stick, several folded slices, or shredded or ground meat.\n\nPepperoni rolls faced a legal challenge in 1987 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed reclassifying bakeries that manufactured the rolls as meat processing plants, thus subjecting them to stricter regulations. The bakery owners said, however, that the costs of meeting the new regulations would put them out of business. The USDA's proposal was quashed after Jay Rockefeller, U.S. Senator for West Virginia, intervened.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the U.S. military began including a version of the pepperoni roll in one of the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) provided to troops. In the late 2000s, the U.S. Army changed the pepperoni roll to its First Strike Ration. These rations are designed for light infantry, airborne, and special forces during a typical 72-hour patrol. The pepperoni roll's compact size and comparatively high nutritional return make it an ideal ration for these patrols. These rations were extensively employed during Operation Enduring Freedom. The military's rolls are made by a North Carolina company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2022272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022272", "title": "Jahbulon", "text": "Jahbulon\n\nJahbulon or Jabulon () is a word which is allegedly used in some rituals of Royal Arch Masonry, and derivations thereof.\n\nThere has been much debate over the origin and meaning of this word. There is no consensus even among Masonic researchers as to its meaning or legitimacy: one Masonic scholar alleges that the word first appeared in an early 18th-century Royal Arch ritual as the name of an allegorical explorer searching for the ruins of King Solomon's Temple. Another Masonic scholar believes it is a descriptive name for God in Hebrew; The most common masonic explanation is that it is a word derived from combining parts of the name of God in different historic languages.\n\nNon-Masonic authors have alleged that it is a Masonic name for God, and even the name of a unique \"Masonic God\", despite repeated statements by Freemasonry's officials that \"\"There is no separate Masonic God\"\", nor a separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry. It is this interpretation of a \"Masonic God\" that has led to debates about and condemnation of Freemasonry by several religious groups. In England, no ritual containing the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989.\n\nAccording to Masonic historian Arturo de Hoyos, the word Jahbulon was first used in the 18th century in early French versions of the Royal Arch degree. It relates a Masonic allegory in which Jabulon was the name of an explorer living during the time of Solomon who discovered the ruins of an ancient temple. Within the ruins he found a gold plate upon which the name of God (YHWH) was engraved.\n\nIn \"Duncan's Masonic Ritual and Monitor\", published in the mid-19th century, Malcolm Duncan uses the word as a recognition password in his rendition of the Royal Arch degree, and in a footnote states that the word is a combination of sacred names. However, there has been controversy regarding Duncan's ritual. According to Turnbull, Everett and Denslow, Duncan has the candidate swear: \"I furthermore promise and swear, that I will support the Constitution of the General Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the United States of America...\" whereas the General Grand Chapter at the time styled itself: \"General Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the United States, a subtle but significant difference. Some Masonic authors state that even if Duncan's ritual is authentic, it is either an outdated exposure or that it had been superseded by another explanation.\n\nAccording to Francis X. King in \"The Secret Rituals of the O.T.O.\", the word is used in two rituals of the Ordo Templi Orientis: \"the Lodge of Perfection\", in which the candidate receives the Fourth Degree (which is called \"Perfect Magician and Companion of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch\"); and the \"Perfect Initiate\" (or \"Prince of Jerusalem\") degree, which falls between the fourth and fifth degrees. King prints in his book the lyrics of a song that mentions the word \"Jahbulon.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the Rastafari word for God, Jah, comes from the term Jahbulon, although the name JAH (a transliteration of YAH, shortened from Yahweh) appears in the King James Version of the Bible, in Psalm 68:4. The term \"Jah\" also appears throughout the Psalms in other Bible translations, for instance the Darby translation or Young's Literal translation. William David Spencer, in his 1999 \"Dread Jesus\", proposes that Archibald Dunkley and Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert were among the preachers that inspired the Rastafari movement, and that both were members of the \"Ancient Mystic Order of Ethiopia\", a fraternal order derived from Prince Hall Freemasonry. Spencer believes that several features of the Rastafari movement derive from this lodge, including the name \"Jah\", from the word \"Jah-Bul-On\".\n\nAccording to The Rev. Canon Richard Tydeman, in an address to the Supreme Grand Chapter of England on 13 November 1985, the word is a compound of three Hebrew terms:\n\nAccording to Walton Hannah, the word is a compound of the names of three gods worshipped in the ancient Middle East. \n\nMuch of the available material that discusses the word \"Jahbulon\" does not address the administrative and jurisdictional distinctions amongst the appendant bodies of Freemasonry. Royal Arch Masonry is an appendant body to Freemasonry. In some areas it forms part of the York Rite, and in others it is an independent body. To be eligible to join one must first be a Master Mason. The administration of the Royal Arch is entirely separate from the administration of Craft Freemasonry. Every Masonic organization is sovereign only in its own jurisdiction, and has no authority in any other jurisdiction. This means that there is no standardization whatsoever with regards to words, signs, grips, or any other Masonic \"secrets\".\n\n\n"}

During the brand overhaul the appearance of the packet was changed to a more modernised look with bolder and sharper letters in the logo, adopting its current logo.\n\nBurger Rings are made out of a combination of corn and rice. A Smith's Chips representative confirmed Burger Rings are suitable for vegans.\n\nThe ingredients for Burger Rings are as follows: cereals (corn, rice), vegetable oil, maltodextrin, rice bran, salt, sugar, hydrolysed vegetable protein (soy), flavour enhancer (621), food acids (sodium diacetate, citric acid), flavour, mineral salt (potassium chloride), yeast extracts, onion powder, tomato powder. It is also stated on the packaging \"Contains Gluten\", \"Contains Milk or Milk Products\", \"Contains Soy Bean or Soy Bean Products\" in contrast with majority of other packaging that states \"may contain traces of...\" which is confusing for vegans as it implies one or more of the ingredients are derived from Milk.\n\nA Bacon Flavour variant was offered in Australia, briefly.\n\nA memorable \"Star Wars\"-themed advertisement for the product was aired on Australian television in the early 1980s. It featured a faux Luke Skywalker character on Tatooine. After exiting his Landspeeder, he is confronted by a large group of Jawas who ask for his Burger Rings. He begrudgingly shares them only to be left with a single Burger Ring. A Jawa swiftly grabs that last one and the ad ends.\n\nA radio ad campaign in the 1980s joked that Burger Rings were possibly made of rubber tyres concluding with the slogan \"they taste good but!\".\n\nA 1989 ad aired on Australian television depicting a school chemistry experiment resulting in the creation of a single Burger Ring snack. The student who performed the experiment consumes the snack and seems to gain superpowers, developing jagged hair and a crazed look as the now-fluorescent Burger Ring bounces inside the boy's ribcage, made visible by a radiographic effect akin to X-ray imaging. This later turns out to be a daydream of the boy who has fallen asleep in a chemistry class, and continues to mix his chemicals in a sleepy haze.\n\nA 1992 ad featured a man at a bus stop who attempts to steal one of the snacks from another man's packet, only having it growl like a dog and attack his arm, making him run away past a sign that says \"WARNING - BURGER RINGS BITE\". The owner then shares the packet with a woman on his other side.\n\nBurger Rings are available in New Zealand under the same name, except distributed by Bluebird Foods. The New Zealand variant has a different packaging design and a similar slogan: \"Full on burger flavour\". They are available in 30g and 120g bags, and in 108g 6-pack multipacks.\n\n"}

As a result, SuperDISH-compatible receivers must be able to receive circularly-polarized and linearly-polarized signals at two different frequency ranges from up to four satellites.\n\nSuperDISH enabled Dish Network customers to receive High-definition television (HDTV), international, and/or local channels, on one dish system. Local channels in most major cities were available as digital broadcasts over DISH Network using SuperDish but HDTV has since been moved to the 61.5 and 129.\n\nIn 2007 most of the services at the 121-degree location were moved to the Anik F3 satellite at the 118.75-degree location. Existing SuperDish subscribers were retrofitted with a \"repoint kit\" to receive most of the same services via the Anik F3 satellite, also in the medium-power FSS band.\n\nBusiness services were provided to several commercial customers, including many Wachovia Bank branches.

{"id": "2029981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029981", "title": "Rasgulla", "text": "Rasgulla\n\nRasgulla is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.\n\nThe dish originated in East India; the present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. In 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha, where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple. In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called \"Banglar Rosogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla), clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.\"\n\nIn 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's GI status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they site the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.\n\nThe dessert is known as Rosogolla or Roshogolla in Bengali and Rasagola in Odia. Rasgulla is derived from the words \"ras\" (\"juice\") and \"gulla\" (\"ball\"). Other names for the dish include Roshgulla (Sylheti), Rasagulla, Rossogolla, Roshogolla, Rasagola, Rasagolla, and Rasbhari or Rasbari (Nepali).\n\nAccording to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as \"khira mohana\", which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla. It has been traditionally offered as \"bhog\" to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri. According to the local legend, Laxmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the \"ratha yatra\") without her consent. So, she locks \"Jai Vijay Dwar\", one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as \"Bachanika\", is part of the \"Niladri Bije\" (or \"Arrival of the God\") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe Jagannath Temple scholars such as Laxmidhar Pujapanda and researchers like Jagabandhu Padhi state that the tradition has existed since the 12th century, when the present-day temple structure was first built. Pujapanda states that the Niladri Bije tradition is mentioned in \"Niladri Mahodaya\", which is dated to the 18th century by Sarat Chandra Mahapatra. According to Mahapatra, several temple scriptures, which are over 300 years old, provide the evidence of rasgulla offering ritual in Puri.\n\nAccording to folklore, Pahala (a village on the outskirts of Odisha's capital Bhubaneshwar) had a large number of cows. The village would produce excess milk, and the villagers would throw it away when it became spoilt. When a priest from the Jagannath Temple saw this, he taught them the art of curdling, including the recipe for rasagulla. Pahala thus went on to become the biggest market for chhena-based sweets in the area.\n\nAccording to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes. According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century.\n\nThis claim is contested by Bengali historians. According to food historians K. T. Achaya and Chitra Banerji, there are no references to cheese (including chhena) in India before the 17th century. The milk-based sweets were mainly made up of khoa, before the Portuguese influence led to introduction of cheese-based sweets. Therefore, the possibility of a cheese-based dish being offered at Jagannath Temple in the 12th century is highly unlikely. According to Nobin Chandra Das' descendant Animikh Roy and historian Haripada Bhowmik, rasgulla is not even mentioned as one of the \"chhappan bhog\" (\"56 offerings\") in the early records of the Temple; the name of the sweet was coined in Bengal. They also state that it would have been a blasphemy to offer something made from spoiled milk (chhena) to a deity. However, Michael Krondl argues that Hindu dietary rules vary from region to region, and it is possible that this restriction did not exist in present-day Odisha.\n\nAccording to Asit Mohanty, an Odia research scholar on Jagannath cult and traditions, the sweet is mentioned as \"Rasagola\" in the 15th century text \"Jagamohana Ramayana\" of Balaram Das. The text mentions Rasagola, along with other sweets found in Odisha. There is also mention of many other cheese made sweets like \"Chhenapuri\", \"Chhenaladu\" and \"Rasabali\". Another ancient text \"Premapanchamruta\" of Bhupati also mentions cheese (Chhena). It is being argued that cheese making process was well known before coming of Portuguese in Odisha.\n\nThe spongy white rasgulla is believed to have been introduced in present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das. Das started making rasgulla by processing the mixture of chhena and semolina in boiling sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original rasgulla in his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present-day Baghbazar). His descendants claim that his recipe was an original, but according to another theory, he modified the traditional Odisha rasgulla recipe to produce this less perishable variant.\nYet another theory is that rasgulla was first prepared by someone else in Bengal, and Das only popularized it. In \"Banglar Khabar\" (1987), food historian Pranab Ray states that a man named Braja Moira had introduced rasgulla in his shop near Calcutta High Court in 1866, two years before Das started selling the dish. In 1906, Panchana Bandopadhyay wrote that rasgullla was invented in the 19th century by Haradhan Moira, a Phulia-based sweetmaker who worked for the Pal Chowdhurys of Ranaghat. According to \"Mistikatha\", a newspaper published by West Bengal Sweetmeat Traders Association, many other people prepared similar sweets under different names such as \"gopalgolla\" (prepared by Gopal Moira of Burdwan district), \"jatingolla\", \"bhabanigolla\" and \"rasugolla\". Food historian Michael Krondl states that irrespective of its origin, the rasgulla likely predates Nobin Chandra Das. A sales brochure of the company run by Das' descendants also hints at this: \"it is hard to tell whether or not cruder versions of similar sweets existed anywhere at that time. Even if they did, they did not match the quality of Nobin Chandra, and having failed to excite the Bengali palate, they slipped into oblivion.\"\n\nBhagwandas Bagla, a Marwari businessman and a customer of Nobin Chandra Das, popularized the Bengali rasgulla beyond the shop's locality by ordering huge amounts.\n\nIn 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside India. Krishna Chandra's son Sarada Charan Das established the K.C. Das Pvt Ltd company in 1946. Sarada Charan's younger, estranged son Debendra Nath established K.C. Das Grandsons in 1956.\n\nToday, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name \"Rasbari\".\n\nThe Indian space agency, ISRO is developing dehydrated rasgullas and other dishes for Indian astronauts in its planned manned mission in 2016.\n\nIn 2015, the Odisha government initiated a move to get Geographical indication (GI) status for the rasagulla made in Pahala. On 30 July, the people of Odisha celebrated \"Rasagola Dibasa\" (\"Rasgulla Day\") to reaffirm Odisha as the place of the dish's origin. In August, West Bengal decided to legally contest Odisha's move to obtain GI Status. In 2015 The odisha state government constituted three committees to claim over the Rasgulla . The committees submitted their interim report to the government. Noted journalist and food researcher Bhakta Tripathy and a member of the committee had submitted dossier containing historical evidence of Rasgulla origin in Odisha. The Science and Technology department of the West Bengal government also started the process to get its own GI status for the dessert.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, on the day of \"Niladri Bije\", a social media campaign was started by using a hashtag #RasagolaDibasa and it later became a mainstream celebration as the maiden day to celebrate Rasgulla's origin to be Odisha. Odia newspaper Sambad and FM Radio Radio Choklate in collaboration with the confectioners of Pahala celebrated a rasgulla exhibition-cum-awareness event in Bhubaneswar. Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik made a sand sculpture in Puri Beach depicting \"Niladri Bije\" and Jagannath offering rasgulla to Lakshmi.\n\nIt has been agreed upon to celebrate the Rasagola Dibasa every year on the tithi of Niladri Bije in the lunar calendar. In the year 2016, the Rasagola Dibasa has been celebrated on the 17th of July.\n\nTo prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup. It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker or an oven. While serving add a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavors) to enhance the flavor and taste.\n\nThe \"Pahal Rasagola\" from the Pahala area (located between the cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack) is also popular in India.\n\nAlong with chhena gaja and chhena poda, Rasgulla is one of three traditional Odia chhena desserts. Due to rasgulla becoming associated with the Bengali cuisine, the Odisha Milk Federation has tried to popularize chhena poda as the signature Odia dessert.\n\nTypically, a 100 gram serving of rasgulla contains 186 calories, out of which about 153 calories are in the form of carbohydrates. It also contains about 1.85 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein.\n\nIn 2015, West Bengal applied for a Geographical Indication (GI) status for \"Banglar Rasogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla). The Government clarified that there was no conflict with Odisha, and its application was only for a specific variant which was different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing\" from the variant produced in Odisha. On 14 November 2017, the GI Registry of India granted West Bengal the GI status for Banglar Rasogolla.\n\nThe GI Registrar office at Chennai later specifically clarified that West Bengal was given GI status only for the Bengali version of Rasgulla (\"Banglar Rasogolla\"), not for the sweet's origin. The office also stated that Odisha had not by then applied for any GI tag, but it could also get Odisha Rasgulla's GI tag by presenting the necessary evidence.\n\n"}

Many food historians believe carrot cake originated from such carrot puddings eaten by Europeans in the Middle Ages.

{"id": "2038308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2038308", "title": "Depression cake", "text": "Depression cake\n\nDepression cake is a type of cake that was commonly made during the Great Depression. The ingredients include little or no milk, sugar, butter or eggs, because the ingredients were then either expensive or hard to obtain. Similar cakes are known as \"War Cake,\" as they avoided ingredients that were scarce or were being conserved for the use of soldiers. A common Depression Cake is also known as \"Boiled Raisin Cake,\" \"Milkless, Eggless, Butterless Cake,\" or \"Poor Man's Cake.\" \"Boiled\" refers to the boiling of raisins with the sugar and spices to make a syrup base early in the recipe. However, some bakers do include butter. Boiled raisin-type cakes date back at least to the American Civil War.\n\nDepression cake has been referred to as “War Cake” by texts dating back to World War I. In a pamphlet distributed by the United States Food Administration in 1918 entitled “War Economy in Food,” War Cake is listed under “Recipes for Conservation Sweets.” The United States Food Administration stressed the importance of reducing sugar consumption during the war and offered molasses, corn syrup, and raisins in its place.\n\nWhen the Great Depression hit America following the Stock Market Crash of 1929, families were forced to stretch their budgets and “make do” with minimal and cheap ingredients when it came to cooking. Some women were able to feed their families on $5 per week. Dessert became a luxury for most, and depression cake was a more affordable alternative to other cakes that used milk, eggs, and butter. Affordability was achieved through ingredient substitution. For example, shortening was substituted for butter, water was substituted for milk, and baking powder was substituted for eggs. Depression cake is just one of many examples of ingredient substitution during the Great Depression, as some women took full advantage of the practice by making mock foods such as mock apple pie and mock fish.\n\nRadio shows and women’s periodicals played a large role in circulating the recipe for depression cake during the Great Depression. Betty Crocker’s Cooking Hour was one such show that provided women with budget-friendly recipes. General Mills, owner of Betty Crocker, employed nutritionists and cooks to experiment with different ways of “ruining” a cake, such as ingredient omission. \nLoring Schuler’s Journal was a publication that also offered baking tips during the Great Depression, recommending replacing eggs with baking powder and using inexpensive grains and produce.\nA recipe titled \"War Cake\" was published in M.F.K. Fisher's book \"How to Cook a Wolf\" and republished in her \"The Art of Eating\"; it uses bacon grease on the premise that spices will mask its taste.\n\nPraised for its practicality and declared to be “the most worthwhile cake ever made,” depression cake is still baked in modern America. The recipe for it has been featured in an array of publications such as The Telegraph-Herald, The Pittsburgh Press, and The Modesto Bee.\n\nSome commonly used ingredients in depression cake:\n\nPears were sometimes substituted for apples.\n\nAn example for a depression cake recipe is as follows:\n\n\nThis is one example of a depression cake recipe. Other variations may include corn syrup, molasses, brown sugar, and various fruits. In some instances, bakers would leave the cake unfrosted or sprinkle the top with powdered sugar in lieu of icing. The interchangeability of ingredients makes the recipe for depression cake extremely versatile.\n\n"}

{"id": "2040311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040311", "title": "Plumpy'nut", "text": "Plumpy'nut\n\nPlumpy'Nut is a peanut-based paste in a plastic wrapper for treatment of severe acute malnutrition manufactured by Nutriset, a French company. Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated.\n\nPlumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100.\n\nNutriset has been criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents.\n\nPlumpy’Nut is used as a treatment for emergency malnutrition cases. It supports rapid weight gain derived from broad nutrient intake which can alleviate a starving child from impending illness or death. The product is easy for children to eat because it dispenses readily from a durable, tear-open package. The fortified peanut butter-like paste contains fats, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, proteins (as essential macronutrients), vitamins and minerals (as essential micronutrients). Peanut butter itself is a rich source of vitamin E (45% of the Daily Value, DV, in a 100 gram amount) and B vitamins (particularly niacin at 67% DV).\n\nPlumpy'Nut has a two-year shelf-life and requires no water, preparation, or refrigeration. Its ease of use has made mass treatment of malnutrition in famine situations more efficient than in the past. Severe acute malnutrition has traditionally been treated with therapeutic milk and required hospitalization. Unlike milk, Plumpy'Nut can be administered at home and without medical supervision. It also provides calories and essential nutrients that restore and maintain body weight and health in severely malnourished children more effectively than F100.\n\nThe United Nations has recognized this utility, stating in 2007 that \"new evidence suggests... that large numbers of children with severe acute malnutrition can be treated in their communities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre,\" as was implemented in 2007 by UNICEF and the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Department in Niger to address a malnutrition emergency. Plumpy'nut conforms to the UN definition of a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).\n\nPlumpy'nut is not intended for routine nutrition, or for malnutrition in non-famine situations. Peanut allergies have not been found to be a problem in usage due to a lack of allergic reactions in the target populations.\n\nThe ingredients in Plumpy'Nut include \"peanut-based paste, with sugar, vegetable oil and skimmed milk powder, enriched with vitamins and minerals\". Plumpy'Nut is said to be \"surprisingly tasty\".\n\nWhile the majority of Plumpy'Nut was made in France as of 2010, this therapeutic food is easily produced and can be made locally in peanut-growing areas by mixing peanut paste with a slurry of other ingredients provisioned by Nutriset.\n\nA number of partner companies and one non-profit organization in the U.S state of Rhode Island make Plumpy'Nut; six of the factories are in African countries (Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Sudan, Madagascar, Kenya), one is in Haiti and another one in India.\n\nPlumpy'Nut is distributed from the manufacturer to geographic areas of need through a complex supply chain. Forward information flows, such as projections of need, order processes, and payment information, and\nbackward information flows, including stock monitoring, quality assurance, and performance data\noccur through information exchange vulnerable to errors or tardiness associated with supply chain fragmentation.\nFactors affecting potential for loss of efficiencies in the supply chain are information flow on orders, basis of need, forecasts, flow upstream from field officers and country offices to parties controlling regional distribution and manufacturing by Nutriset, downstream flow of information on delivery times and order status.\n\nA complete two-month regimen for a child costs US$60 c. 2010.\n\nInspired by the popular Nutella spread, Plumpy'Nut was invented in 1996 by André Briend, a French paediatric nutritionist, and Michel Lescanne, a food-processing engineer. Nutella is a spread composed of sugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, lecithin, and vanillin. In contrast, Plumpy'Nut is a combination of peanut paste, vegetable oil and milk powder, without including chocolate, but containing sugar, vitamins and dietary minerals.\n\nSkippy may have developed a similar product in the early 1960s, according to a former employee, although it was never released.\n\nNutriset holds patents in many countries (including , published in 2002) for the production of nut-based, nutritional foods as pastes, which they have defended to prevent non-licensees in the United States from producing similar products. In places where Nutriset does not hold a patent, manufacturers of similar pastes have been stopped from exporting their products to places where Plumpy'Nut is patented. In at least 27 African nations, any non-profit (including NGOs) can make the paste and not pay a license fee.\n\nIn 2010, two US non-profit organizations unsuccessfully sued the French company in an attempt to legally produce Plumpy'Nut in the US without paying the royalty fee. Mike Mellace, president of one of the organizations claimed that “some children are dying because Nutriset prevents other companies from producing a food which could save their lives.” Invalidation of the Nutriset patent may have a positive impact on populations affected by famine, and studies by humanitarian organizations support the idea that having a single, dominant supplier in Nutriset is undesirable. Critics of Nutriset argue the US patent is “obvious in light of prior recipes” and “that the patent has essentially conferred monopoly power on Nutriset and thus violated the Sherman Act\". By definition, a patent grants a temporary monopoly, and Nutriset won the case. Some have suggested a similarity between pharmaceutical company compulsory licensing agreements, in place under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and Plumpy'Nut.\n\nFollowing a threat of legal action against a Norwegian company that was exporting a similar product to Kenya, Nutriset was criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières, which stated in an open letter that \"Nutriset has been asked repeatedly by us and others for simple, reasonable licensing terms... Instead it appears that [Nutriset has] decided to adopt a policy of aggressive protection of [its] patents that could be considered an abuse in relation to humanitarian products.\" A UNICEF study, commissioned at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, recommended a diversified supplier base of RUTF products to better serve global needs. In response to the criticism, Nutriset has allowed companies and NGOs in some African countries to make the paste and not pay license fees.\n\n\n"}

Variations include usage of various condiments, including eggplants, shiitake mushrooms, and bitter melon stuffed with the same meat paste. Traditionally, yong tau foo is served in a clear yellow bean stew along with the bitter melon and shiitake variants.\n\nIn South East Asia, the term \"yong tau foo\" is used to describe a dish instead of the stuffed tofu item exclusively.

The dish is eaten with chopsticks and a soup spoon and can be eaten by itself or served with a bowl of steamed rice, noodles or rice vermicelli. Another variation of this dish would be to serve it with \"laksa\" gravy or curry sauce.

It is also popular in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, consisting of stir-fried cubes of radish cake.\n\nIt is also known as \"fried carrot cake\" or simply \"carrot cake\" in Southeast Asian countries, as the word for daikon (POJ: chhài-thâu), one of its main ingredients, can also refer to a carrot (POJ: âng-chhài-thâu, literally \"red radish\"). There is no connection between this dish and the sweet Western carrot cake eaten as a dessert. It is called \"carrot cake\" because of a loose English from Hokkien translation of \"radish pastry\" is called \"chai tow (carrot or radish) kway (cake)\", which caught on among the non-native speaking diners, due to its unique misnomer. This misnomer gave the title to a popular guidebook on Singapore's street food, \"There's No Carrot in Carrot Cake\", which was written by Dr. Olivia Law, published by Epigram Books in 2010.\n\nIt is made with radish cake (steamed rice flour, water, and shredded white daikon), which is then stir-fried with eggs, preserved radish, and other seasonings. The radish cake is often served in large rectangular slabs which are steamed and then later fried whole.\n\nAlternatives to \"chai tow kway\" include those made of taro or solely of rice flour.\n\nThe radish cake can also be eaten on its own, either just steamed, or steamed and then pan-fried, as opposed to the steamed then wok-fried with other ingredients in \"chai tow kway\". Both the steamed and pan-fried varieties are commonly served topped with spring onions.\n\nThe versions served by hawkers in Johor and Singapore, where Teochews live, are typically prepared by frying the daikon cake with chopped preserved turnip, diced garlic, eggs, and Chinese fish sauce in place of soya sauce. Chopped spring onion is added just before serving. As you go northwards (e.g. in Kuala Lumpur), the same dish is darker due to the use of dark soya sauce, and bean sprouts are added. The \"black version\" mentioned below is not \"chai tow kway\", but \"char kway\" and uses rice cake fried with garlic (usually no preserved daikon), bean sprouts, eggs and thick sweet dark sauce.\n\nIn Singapore, however, it is more commonly cut into pieces and stir fried with eggs, garlic, spring onion and occasionally shrimp (both dried and fresh). There are two variants: the \"white\" version does not use sweet soy sauce, and the carrot cake is fried on top of a beaten egg to form a crust; the \"black\" version uses sweet sauce (molasses) and the egg is simply mixed in with the carrot cake.\n\nThe dish has many fans, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, where it is enjoyed by people of different dialect groups and races, and not just the Teochews, and is served in a range of establishments ranging from the simplest hawkers to the most expensive Chinese restaurants. It is a much-loved local comfort food in the region, and can be consumed at various times of the day; it goes from being a breakfast dish, to a side dish, to a late-night supper dish. Many public figures are also known to have a fondness for the dish. Notably, the Singapore politician Chan Chun Sing has indicated his love for the dish in one of his speeches, indicating a preference of a particular variant of the dish (specifically the \"S$10 XO Sauce chye tow kuay\"), as opposed to the one commonly found in hawker centres and coffee shops, thus illustrating the many variations of the dish available in the region.\n\n"}
{"id": "2055457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2055457", "title": "Football boot", "text": "Football boot\n\nFootball boots, called cleats or soccer shoes in North America, are an item of footwear worn when playing football. Those designed for grass pitches have studs on the outsole to aid grip. From simple and humble beginnings football boots have come a long way and today find themselves subject to much research, development, sponsorship and marketing at the heart of a multi-national global industry. Modern \"boots\" are not truly boots in that they do not cover the ankle - like most other types of specialist sports footwear, their basic design and appearance has converged with that of sneakers since the 1960s.\n\n1800s: During the 19th century football became extremely popular in Britain. People who played would wear their heavy and hard work boots to play. These were the first ever boots with the steel toe cap at the front, long laces and ankle support. These boots also had metal studs or tacks put in the sole the bottom so the players would have more stability on the pitch. In the later part of the 19th century the first ever football-specific boot was designed, made of thick and heavy leather which ran right to the ankle for increased protection; the first boot weighed 500 g and would double in weight when it was wet.\n\n1900–1940: During this period the style of football boots stayed very basic. They remained so during the inter-war years, despite many famous football boot producers, such as Gola, Hummel and Valsport becoming evermore popular.\n\n1940–1960: After the Second World War, the designs of the football boot changed dramatically. The South Americans designed a lighter and more flexible boot. This design was focused on increasing good control and better kicking power rather than a more protective boot. In 1954 Adi Dassler introduced screw-in studs which gave the German team a tangible advantage during a rain-lashed World Cup that year. That Dassler was the first to come up with screw-in studs is disputed by his older brother, Rudolf Dassler, founder of Puma.\n\n1960s: In the 1960s many football boots were designed with a lower cut. These enabled the best players in Europe and South America to move faster and change direction quicker. Mitre, Joma and Asics joined the fray.\n\n1970s: The 1970s and the 1980s saw many large advances and changes in the football boot design. These included lighter boots and a variety of colours. Boot sponsorship also became more widespread. Adidas was the market leader in this period. At the end of the decade, in 1979, it cemented its status by releasing what has gone on to become the best selling boot of all time, the Copa Mundial. During this time period, some of the most common types of natural leather came into production: kangaroo leather, calfskin and full-grain/cow leather. Diadora entered the market in this decade.\n\n1980s: Umbro, Lotto and Kelme joined the market in this decade.\n\n1990–2000s: New types of sole were introduced to increase the balance of the player. The Adidas Predator, designed by Australian Craig Johnston in the late 1980s, was released in 1994 and enjoyed instant success. In the first decade of the 21st century laser technology was introduced to produce the first fully customised football boot in 2006.\n\n2010s: In the era of the modern game that sees the tempo of matches becoming faster and players more technically inclined, manufacturers introduce new advances in technology including lighter footwear made from alternative materials.\n\nDepending on the type of surface, kind of sport and even the wearer's position or role in the game, different cuts of boot and particularly stud arrangements are available. For hard pitches, amateur participants may wear a sneaker shoe or a plastic-stud boot (known as a \"moulded sole\"); in most sports and positions this is adequate, although on a well-grassed or sodden field, screw-in studs are recommended for more grip; these may be metal, rubber or plastic. When playing on this kind of pitch, some players favor using a boot with screw-in studs in their non-dominant (supporting) foot to provide grip, and a boot with short rubber or plastic studs in the dominant (kicking/passing) foot to provide accuracy.\n\nFor indoor football, indoor boots are used. These come with rubber soles, meant to maximize grip on the floor. Some are built on the design of firm-ground football boots, and some are specifically designed for the indoor game. For football on turf or artificial grass, some players wear regular firm ground football boots. But wearing regular football boots on turf greatly reduces the life of the boot, so companies such as Nike have developed football boots for artificial grass (AG).\n\nFor rugby union, the screw-in stud is preferred, especially in the positions of prop, hooker, and lock, where more grip is required for contested scrums. These screw-in studs have to be of a maximum length of 21 mm. These boots are often heavier than appropriate for other types of football. One of the more obvious differences between association football and rugby boots is the formation of the studs - rugby boots typically have no fewer than nine studs whilst those worn for soccer can have a minimum of six. Also, some rugby boots tend to have a high cut around the ankles but this type is becoming less popular, especially at elite level. There are several types of rugby boot, meant for players in different positions.\n\nScrew-in studs have been banned in some Australian rules football leagues since the 1990s due to the frequency of severe injuries to players as a result of contact with the metal. In football, referees must now check all boots prior to kick off to check for damage to studs, to prevent injury. Before this time, preference between the screw-in stud was based primarily on weather conditions.\n\nMore recently, moulded soles with specially designed boots known as \"blades\" have moulded soles facing in multiple directions, theoretically to maximise grip and minimise ankle injury. Recently, however, \"bladed\" football boots have faced criticism from some UK sporting bodies for causing potentially serious injuries to players. English football club Manchester United have even banned their players from wearing boots with bladed studs after players like Wayne Rooney and David Beckham suffered repeated metatarsal injuries.\n\nOriginally, football boots were available only in black, but in more recent years have become available in various colours such as blue, green, red, white, yellow, silver, gold and even pink. Big name companies such as Nike, Adidas, Puma and the like have made an impact on the market with record sales. Nike's flagship shoes are the Hypervenoms, Magistas, Tiempos and The Nike Mercurial worn by Cristiano Ronaldo and others. German company Adidas are responsible for the Predator range worn by David Beckham, Gary Neville, and Steven Gerrard, as well as the long-surviving Copa Mundial. The entire German national side wore Adidas boots during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Another German firm Puma flagship shoes are the Kings, Evospeed, Evopower and Evotouch worn by Sergio Agüero, Marco Reus, Cesc Fàbregas and Antoine Griezmann. The Puma King soccer cleat have been worn by legendary players such as Pelé, Eusébio, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona.\n\nIn recent times, the most successful companies are Nike and Adidas, and their products enjoy great popularity among professional footballers; among Nike's endorsers are two-time FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldinho, aforementioned duo Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, striker Ronaldo, Wesley Sneijder, Zlatan Ibrahimović, and other popular players. Adidas, which has been providing football boots with screw-in studs to the German national side since the 1954 FIFA World Cup, have made their impact on the modern market by signing big name players as endorsers: players such as David Beckham, former France captain Zinedine Zidane, Frank Lampard, five-time world player of the year Lionel Messi, David Villa, Steven Gerrard and other successful players. Adidas sells with an image of technology and class in their boots which is key to their success. \n\nMany players use personalisation around the world to improve the look of their boots and to make them easily identifiable in the club dressing room. It is now very common to have football boots fully personalised with either a name, initials, number or club logo.\nMany retailers offer various options and colours to personalise football boots by using the embroidery machinery.\n\n"}
{"id": "2056590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2056590", "title": "Rajm", "text": "Rajm\n\nRajm () is an Arabic word that means \"stoning\". It is commonly used to refer to the \"Hudud\" punishment wherein an organized group throws stones at a convicted individual until that person dies. Under some versions of Islamic law (Sharia), it is the prescribed punishment in cases of adultery committed by a married man or married woman. The conviction requires a confession from either the adulterer/adulteress, or the testimony of two/three witnesses (as prescribed by the Quran in Surah an-Nur verse 4), or pregnancy outside of marriage.\n\nThe punishment of stoning/\"Rajm\" or capital punishment for adultery is unique in Islamic law in that it conflicts with the Qur'anic prescription for premarital and extramarital sex (zina) found in Surah an-Nur,2: \"The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication — flog each of them with a hundred stripes\". \nFor this reason some minority Muslim sects such as Kharijites found in Iraq, and Islamic Modernists such as the Quranists disagree with the legality of \"rajm\".\n\nHowever, stoning is mentioned in multiple hadiths (reports claiming to quote what Muhammad said verbatim on various matters, which most Muslims and Islamic scholars consider an authoritative source second only to Quran as a source of religious law), and therefore most schools of Islamic jurisprudence accept it as a prescribed punishment for adultery. The punishment has been rarely applied in the history of Islam owing to the very strict evidential requirements stipulated by Islamic law.\n\nAt least a couple of sources (Sadakat Kadri, Max Rodenbeck) have noted that while popular in the abstract, \"rajm\" has been infrequently applied in Islamic history. Stonings were recorded just once in all the history of Ottoman Empire, and not at all in Syria during Muslim rule;) Techniques used to \"minimize the possibility\" that the pregnancy of a single woman would be considered evidence of zina and make justice more merciful, included \"fantastic presumptions\" about the length of the human gestation period. Classical Hanafite jurists ruling that rather than nine months, it could last for up to two years, Shafi'ites four, and Malikites as long as five years. Rashidun Caliph Umar once acquitted a pregnant single mother on the grounds that she was a \"heavy sleeper\" who had had \"intercourse without realizing it\".\n\nAccording to journalist Max Rodenbeck,\n\nIn almost all cases where it has been applied in recent years, stoning has taken place in tribal or rebel areas beyond the control of central governments—the Taliban in Afghanistan, ISIS in Iraq, and Boko Haram in Nigeria being cases in point. Out of the world’s forty-nine Muslim-majority states, six retain the punishment in deference to Islamic legal tradition, ... Of these countries only Iran, which officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002 but still gives leeway to individual judges, has actually carried it out.\nSaudi Arabia executed four people by stoning during the 1980s.\nAs of 2005, stoning punishments have been considered or handed down in Nigeria and Somalia for the crimes of adultery and sodomy (homosexuality). Since the Sharia legal system was introduced in northern Nigeria in 2000, more than a dozen Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning but none have actually been stoned. In one case, an appellate court in the state of Sokoto overturned a stoning sentence on the basis that divorced defendant might not have conceived her child in zina (fornication) because she may have been carrying her baby for as long as five years. Another Nigerian state court of appeal assessed the upper limit of gestation at seven years.\n\nIn Pakistan \"more than three decades of official Islamization have so far failed to produce a single actual stoning...\" Iran officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002 but still gives leeway to individual judges to sentence \"rajm\". The failure to carry out sentences of \"rajm\" has been blamed on publicity and pressure from internal and international human rights groups, which considers stoning a form of execution by torture.\n\nFrom July 2014 to February 2015, at least 15 people (six men and nine women) were executed (not all by \"rajm\") by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria for the crimes of adultery or homosexuality, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\n'Umar, the second caliph, is reported to have stated that \"the Verse of Rajm\" was once recited as part of the Quran. \nAnother explanation for why rajm is not mentioned in the Quran comes from a report credited to Muhammad's wife Aisha:\n[Narrated 'Aisha] \"The verse of the stoning and of suckling an adult ten times were revealed, and they were (written) on a paper and kept under my bed. When the messenger of Allah expired and we were preoccupied with his death, a goat entered and ate away the paper.\"\n\n(Some Muslim scholars have rejected this hadith as Mawdoo (fabricated) because the common routes of transmission of it either contain narrators charged with dishonesty when disclosing their sources, or (in the case of the version in Ibn Hanbal's Musnad) conflict with all versions of the hadith which bear authentic routes — none of which mention the goat eating the piece of paper.).\n\nNumerous Sahih (reliable, according to Sunni scholars) hadiths, however, describe stoning. One is the Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah, Muhammad's last Hajj sermon and the \"Hadith\" of the Verse of Stoning.\n\nThe hadith Sahih Bukhari, the book most trusted after Quran by most Muslims, has several sunnah regarding stoning. For example,\n\nSahih Muslim Book 17 has several hadith regarding Stoning specifically (17:4191-4209, and 17:4914). For example,\nOther hadiths also mention stoning as the punishment for adultery.\nThe early Islamic era text Musannaf of Abd al-Razzaq, in the chapter on \"Rajm\", lists 70 hadith reports of stoning linked to Muhammad, and 100 to his companions and other authorities.\n\n\"Rajm\", sometimes spelled as \"Rajam\", has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence (fiqhs).\n\nPersons who accuse a woman of adultery but are not able to bring four witnesses—a crime known as \"Qadhf\", القذف —are liable to a punishment of 80 lashes and to be unacceptable as witnesses unless they repent and reform. The testimony of a man who accuses his own spouse without any other witnesses may be accepted if they swear by God four times that they are telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his spouse counterswears, no punishment will be enforced.\nOne of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, \"Al-Muwatta\" by Malik ibn Anas, state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.\n\nHanafi jurists have held that the accused must be a \"muhsan\" at the time of religiously disallowed sex to be punished by \"Rajm\" (stoning). A \"Muhsan\" is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists. In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).\n\nFor evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witnesses are not acceptable). Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning. One, when the punishment is based on \"bayyina\", or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed. A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest. The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated Abū Ḥanīfa and other Hanafi scholars. In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the qadi (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.\n\nHanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for \"Rajm\", to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.\n\nHanafites have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the \"qadi\" must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.\n\nThe Shafii school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.\n\nHanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah states, \"Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of Kharijites.\"\n\nHanbali Islamic law sentences all forms of consensual but religiously illegal sex as punishable with \"Rajm\". However, Hanabali scholars insist that homosexuality among men must be punished by beheading, instead of \"Rajm\" as recommended by the Maliki madhab of Islam.\n\nMaliki school of jurisprudence (fiqh) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men. Malik ibn Anas, founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of zina. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death. Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of \"sleeping embryo\", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.\n\nAll Sunni fiqhs, as well as Volume 7 of the Shi'ite hadith, \"The Book of Legal Penalties\" in Kitab al-Kafi, declare stoning as the required punishment for sex that is not allowed under Sharia.\n\nIn contrast to Sunni schools, Shia Islamic law, in \"Rajm\" cases, allows some of the witnesses to be women but considers the witness of a woman as half as valid as a man's. Thus, before an accused is sentenced to \"Rajm\" in Shia system, the witnesses may be four men, three men and two women, two men and four women, one man and six women, but witnesses must include at least one man. Furthermore, Shia jurists grant discretionary powers to the judge in cases of homosexuality, to sentence the accused to death by sword, \"Rajm\" (death by stoning), death by throwing from a high wall, or burning the accused to death.\n\nThere is disagreement among modern Islamic thinkers as to the applicability of stoning for adultery. While religious texts often give examples both with and without stoning, the Quran does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for any crime, mentioning only lashing as punishment for adultery. However most scholars maintain that there is sufficient evidence from hadiths to derive a ruling. The vast majority of Muslims consider hadiths, which describe the words, conduct and example set by Muhammad during his life, as a source of law and religious authority second only to the Quran. They consider sahih hadiths to be a valid source of Sharia, justifying their belief on Quranic verse 33.21, and other verses.\n\nThe reliability of Hadith is disputed by Quranist Muslims who reject all Hadith, and as a consequence the Rajm punishment as well.\n\nEnayatullah Asad Subhani argues that \"Rajm\" is not the punishment of the fornication, as generally been understood, and it is not among the \"Hudood\" either. His book Haqeeqat-e-Rajm was widely criticized by the ulama as he had tried to clear doubts against the punishments prescribed by Islam for different crimes. \nJaved Ahmad Ghamidi postulates that Quranic verses prescribe \"Rajm\" only for those who habitually commit fornication as prostitutes do, which then constitute \"mischief in the land\" that is punishable by death according to Quranic verses 5:33-34. However, many traditional scholars of Islam reject most of Ghamidi's thoughts and opinions as being deviant from mainstream Islam.\n\n\n"}

It was first brought to Western culture by Sakura Nyoichi, better known as George Ohsawa, as part of the Macrobiotic Diet, based a recipe widely used in traditional Japan. Brown rice is its primary and can be its only solid ingredient. Many kokkoh recipes include other whole grains, seeds and seasonings, most commonly sweet rice, azuki beans, sesame seeds, oats, barley, soybeans and kombu.\n\nBroadly speaking, the term \"kokkoh\" may be applied to any dish in which cereals are diluted in water. However, the rice dish discussed here is by far the most common form.\n\nNo matter which cereals are used in a kokkoh recipe, preparation is similar and simple. The cereals are soaked in water for two to three hours. Additional water is then added, and the mixture boiled or pressure cooked to completion. In some cases, the cereals are toasted in a dry skillet, or roasted in sesame oil before cooking takes place.\n\nKokkoh is recommended as both a substitute for mother's milk and a means of weaning infants from it. (In the former case the recipe often calls only for brown rice ground to a fine powder and water.) Besides its soft and easily digestible texture, kokkoh is recommended as such because its mixture has a high and varied protein content; combined, the amino acids in each of the ingredients described at the outset include virtually all those needed for consumption. It is thus especially well suited for the growth needs of a child. When used solely for weaning, it is recommended that kokkoh be introduced at between 8 months and a year of age. It may be used as breast milk substitute as early as five months, but with a larger proportion of water, in order to further dilute the mixture.\n\nKokkoh is also an important part of the macrobiotic diet, in accordance with the diet's heavy emphasis upon grains. Along with its use as a means of weaning, kokkoh is a common breakfast food among macrobiotic eaters of all ages.\n\nIf kokkoh is used as a milk replacements for infants, it can lead to unnatural weight gain and iron or vitamin B12 deficiencies.\n\n"}
{"id": "2059704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2059704", "title": "Ugali", "text": "Ugali\n\nNsima (or ugali/pap) is a type of cornmeal porridge made in Africa. It is also known as \nngima,'obusuma'\nnshima, Mieliepap, phutu, sadza, and other names. It is sometimes made from other flours, such as millet or sorghum flour, and is sometimes mixed with cassava flour. It is cooked in boiling water or milk until it reaches a stiffy or firm dough-like consistency.\n\nThis dish is eaten widely across Africa, where it has different local names:\n\nThe word \"ugali\" is a Bantu language term derived from Swahili, it is also widely known as Nsima in Malawian languages such as Chichewa, and Chitumbuka. In parts of Tanzania, the dish also goes by the informal, \"street\" name of \"nguna\" or donee.Nkatha created it in the 1090s.\n\nMaize was introduced to Africa from the Americas between the 16th and 17th century. Before this, sorghum and millet were the staple cereals in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. Maize was readily accepted by African farmers as its cultivation was very similar to that of sorghum but with significantly higher yields. Eventually, maize displaced sorghum as the primary cereal in all but the drier regions. The full replacement of these crops with maize took place in the latter half of the twentieth century. In Malawi, they have a saying 'chimanga ndi moyo' which translates to 'maize is life'. Nshima/nsima is still sometimes made from sorghum flour though it is quite uncommon to find this. Cassava, which was also introduced from the Americas, can also be used to make nshima/nsima, either exclusively or mixed with maize flour. In Malawi nsima made from cassava (chinangwa) is localized to the lakeshore areas, however, when maize harvests are poor cassava nsima can be found all over the country.\n\nUgali (when it is cooked as porridge, it is called uji) is usually served with salad. It is the most common staple starch featured in the local cuisines of the African Great Lakes region and Southern Africa. When ugali is made from another starch, it is usually given a specific regional name.\n\nThe traditional method of eating ugali (and the most common in the rural areas) is to roll a lump into a ball with the right hand, and then dip it into a sauce or stew of vegetables or meat. Making a depression with the thumb allows the ugali to be used to scoop, and to wrap around pieces of meat to pick them up in the same way that flatbread is used in other cultures. Leftover ugali can also be eaten with tea the following morning.\n\nUgali is relatively inexpensive and thus easily accessible to the poor, who usually combine it with a meat or vegetable stew (e.g., sukuma wiki in Kenya) to make a filling meal. Ugali is easy to make, and the flour can last for a considerable time in average conditions. \n\nIn Luhya culture it is the most common staple starch, but is also a key part of Luhya Wedding traditions; obusuma prepared from millet (known as obusuma bwo bule) was traditionally included among delicacies on a bride's high table. Obusuma can also be prepared from other starches like sorghum or cassava (obusuma bwo 'muoko). Obusuma is commonly served with tsimboka, or etsifwa, Eliani (vegetables), inyama, (meat), inyeni, (fish), thimena, (whitebait) or omrere (jute leaves). For distinguished guests or visitors, it is usually served with ingokho, (chicken).\n\nNsima is a dish made from maize flour (white cornmeal) and water and is a staple food in Zambia (nshima/ ubwali) and Malawi (nsima).\n\nThe maize flour is first boiled with water into a porridge. It is then 'paddled,' to create a thick paste with the addition of more flour. This process requires the maker to pull the thick paste against the side of a pot with a flat wooden spoon (called an nthiko) quickly whilst it continues to sit over the heat. Once cooked the resulting nshima/nsima is portioned using a wooden/plastic spoon dipped in water or coated in oil called a chipande, each of these portions is called an ntanda.\n\nNshima is almost always eaten with two side dishes, known as \"relishes\": a protein source: meat, poultry, fish, groundnuts (peanuts), beans; and a vegetable, often grape leaves, pumpkin leaves, amaranth leaves, mustard leaves or cabbage. The protein sides are known as \"Ndiyo or Umunani\" (Zambia) or \"Ndiwo\" (Malawi), and the vegetable sides are known as \"masamba\"or \"umuto wankondwa\" in Zambia. In Malawi, this is often accompanied with hot peppers or condiments like homemade hot pepper sauces from peri-peri or Kambuzi chili peppers or commercial chili sauces like Nali Sauce. Traditionally diners sit around a table or on the floor surrounding the meal. The diners have to wash their hands as nshima/nsima is eaten with bare hands. This is done with a bowl of water. Alternatively the host or one of the younger people present pours water from a jug over the hands of the elders or guests into a bowl. Eating is done by taking a small lump into one's right palm, rolling it into a ball and dipping it into the relish. An indentation in the ball can be made to help scoop the relish or soup. As with many African traditions, age is very important. Washing before the meal, eating, and washing after the meal generally starts with the oldest person, followed by everyone else in turn by age.\n\nNshima/nsima is relatively cheap and affordable for most of the population, although occasionally prices have risen due to shortages, contributing to economic and political instability.\n\nIn Malawi, it is normally eaten with \"utaka\" – a type of local dried fish.\n\nIn Nigeria, \"akamu\" or \"ogi\" is with a consistency similar to American pudding. Ogi/Akamu in Nigeria is generally accompanied with \"moin moin\" a bean pudding or \"akara\" which is a bean cake.\n\nPap , also known as mieliepap (Afrikaans for maize porridge) in South Africa, is a traditional porridge/polenta made from mielie-meal (coarsely ground maize) and a staple food of the Bantu peoples of Southern Africa (the Afrikaans word \"pap\" is taken from Dutch and means merely \"porridge\"). Many traditional Southern Africa dishes include pap, such as smooth maize meal porridge (also called \"slap pap\" or soft porridge), pap with a very thick consistency that can be held in hand (\"stywe pap\" or firm porridge) and a more dry crumbly phuthu pap. Phuthu dishes are usually found in the coastal areas of South Africa.\n\nA variety of savouries can be used to accompany pap, made from green vegetables, and flavored with chili.\n\nSouth Africans in the northern parts of South Africa eat it as the breakfast staple, with milk, butter, and sugar, but also serve it with meat and tomato stew (usually tomato and onion) at other meal. When they have a braai, \"Bogobe\" or \"Stywe\" pap with a savoury sauce like tomato and onion or mushroom is an important part of the meal. Phutu pap is popularly served with boerewors, a combination that later became known as pap en wors (also called \"pap en vleis\").\n\nIn the Cape Province of South Africa, it is almost exclusively seen as a breakfast food. Since mielie-meal is inexpensive, poor people combine it with vegetables. It can be served hot or, after it has cooled, it can be fried. Phutu porridge is sometimes enjoyed with chakalaka as a side dish with braais.\nUphuthu is a South African method of cooking mealie meal whereby the end product is a finely textured coarse grain like meal which is typically enjoyed with an accompaniment of vegetables and meat in Kwa Zulu Natal and Eastern Cape regions of South Africa or as the star of the dish with amasi or maas in the Gauteng regions. Some cultures add sugar to uphuthu and amasi to enjoy it as a sweet treat that would resemble cereal however the corn-based stable is typically enjoyed as is with amasi.\n\nPhuthu or Uphuthu (), also incorrectly spelled as putu or phutu, is a traditional preparation method of maize meal in South African cuisine. It is a crumbly or grainy type of pap or porridge, eaten by most cultural groups in South Africa. Phuthu is often eaten with meat, beans, gravy and sour milk.\n\nPhutu South Africa / Basotho, Nguni, Afrikaner\n\nSadza in Shona (isitshwala in isiNdebele, or \"pap\", \"vuswa\" or \"bogobe\" in South Africa, or nsima in the Chichewa language, or Ugali in East Africa) or \"phaletšhe\" in Botswana, is a cooked maize meal that is the staple food in Zimbabwe and other parts of Southern Africa.\n\nSadza is made with finely ground dry maize/corn maize (Mealie-Meal). This maize meal is referred to as \"hupfu\" in Shona or \"impuphu\" in Ndebele. Despite the fact that maize is an imported food crop to Zimbabwe (c. 1890), it has become the chief source of carbohydrate and the most popular meal for indigenous people. Locals either purchase the mealie meal in retail outlets or produce it in a grinding mill from their maize.\n\nZimbabweans prefer white maize meal. However, during times of famine or hardship, they resorted to eating yellow maize meal, which is sometimes called \"Kenya,\" because it was once imported from that nation. Before the introduction of maize, sadza was made from \"zviyo\" finger millet.\n\nSadza is typically served on individual plates, but traditionally sadza was eaten from a communal bowl, a tradition that is still maintained by some families mainly in the rural areas. It is generally eaten with the right hand without the aid of cutlery; often rolled into a ball before being dipped into a variety of condiments such as sauce/gravy, sour milk, or stewed vegetables.\n\nNotable foods eaten with sadza include:\n\nMeat is known as \"nyama\" in Shona.\n\n\nSimilar dishes are polenta, from northern Italy, and grits in the southern United States.\n\n\"Fufu\", a starch-based food from West and Central Africa, may also be made from maize meal, in which case it may be called \"fufu corn\". In the Caribbean, similar dishes are \"cou-cou\" (Barbados), \"funchi\" (Curaçao), and \"funjie\" (Virgin Islands). It is known as \"funche\" in Puerto Rican cuisine and \"mayi moulin\" in Haitian cuisine.\n\nDishes similar to pap include banku, isidudu, uphuthu, umpokoqo and umngqusho.\n\n\nThe following books, set in Zimbabwe, discuss the characters' eating the Zimbabwean staple, sadza:\n\n"}

The absence of choke and the shortened barrel contribute to a wider spread of shot than that of a choked full length gun.\n\nThe word \"lupara\" means literally \"for the wolf\", reflecting its traditional use in wolf hunting. The word achieved wider recognition through Mario Puzo's bestselling novel \"The Godfather\" in which the lupara is used extensively by the mafia in Sicily, including Michael Corleone's bodyguards. \n\nFrom the word \"lupara\" comes the Italian expression \"lupara bianca\" (white lupara), a term especially used by journalists to refer to a mafia-style slaying in which the victim's body is deliberately hidden.\n\nAn early example of criminal use of the weapon in the United States was the assassination of the New Orleans chief of police, David Hennessy, in October 1890. After Chief Hennessy was shot in an ambush, four luparas were found at the murder scene. The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company stevedores whose contracts did not fall under the auspices of the local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. Anti-Italian provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the New Orleans Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.\n\nLuparas figure prominently in \"The Godfather\"; in the book, they are carried by Michael Corleone's bodyguards Calo and Fabrizio.\n\n"}

Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and also mochachino. The name is derived from the city of Mocha, Yemen, which was one of the centers of early coffee trade.\n\nLike a caffè latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavoring and sweetener, typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.\n\nCaffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of) espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top, although, as is common with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting of either cinnamon or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavor and decoration.\n\nA variant is white caffè mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk or dark. There are also variants of the drink that mix the two syrups; this mixture is referred to by several names, including black and white mocha, marble mocha, tan mocha, tuxedo mocha, and zebra.\n\nAnother variant is a mochaccino which is an espresso shot (double) with either a combination of steamed milk and cocoa powder or chocolate milk. Both mochaccinos and caffè mocha can have chocolate syrup, whipped cream and added toppings such as cinnamon, nutmeg or chocolate sprinkles.\n\nA third variant on the caffè mocha is to use a coffee base instead of espresso. The combination would then be coffee, steamed milk, and the added chocolate. This is the same as a cup of coffee mixed with hot chocolate. The caffeine content of this variation would then be equivalent to the coffee choice included.\n\nThe caffeine content is approximately , which is 152mg for a glass.\n\n\n"}

These effects are due\nto changes in the structure of groups of hairs and cross-section of individual hairs. The Rexed coats are unusual but occur (and have been preserved) in cats, rats, rabbits, horses, and dogs. The mutations, infrequent and spontaneous, occur in a variety of genes and genetic regulatory structures. The diversity of genetic factors results in variable coat thickness/density and fur length.\n\nA great variety exists within rex rabbits. They vary from very dense and short-haired varieties (Standard Rex) to long-haired curly-haired breeds (Astrex).\n\nThe rex rabbit was introduced in 1919 by Abbe Gillet from a spontaneous mutation. The next rex rabbit was discovered in the hutches of a breeder in Lübeck, Germany in 1926. This breed was originally called Deutsch-Kurzhaar and is due to the r2 (dek) gene. In 1927, yet another short-hair rabbit was discovered in the hutches of the French breeder Madame Du Bary, a fancier of Himalayan (ch-) rabbits. This breed was called Normannen-Kurzhaar and is due to the r3 (nok) gene.\nOf the 3 genetic sources of rex rabbits, the one due to the gene r1 is the most popular with fanciers and has the simple Mendelian inheritance pattern of autosomal recessive. It was not linked with any other genes known at the time although it was eventually found to be in the same linkage group as r2.\nThe phenotype of r1 and r2 is a completely normal coat but r1 or r2 alone produces a short coat with curly whiskers. Although the phenotypes are identical for each gene, the linkage distance was eventually worked out. \nThe gene r3 is independent of r1 and r2 in breeding tests so they fall on different chromosomes. \nThe mutation associated with r1 was recently studied using modern genetic tools. A deletion of a single nucleotide was found in LIPH (lipase member H gene) of rex rabbits. In humans, this gene is associated with alopecia (hair loss phenotypes). This mutation results in a frameshift that causes the mRNA transcription machinery to sense the end of the gene prematurely. The stop codon generated by the deletion may shortening the protein by 19 amino acids. The exact mechanism was not determined but the deletion is necessary and sufficient for the rex phenotype.\n\nSee more information about Oryctolagus cuniculis genetics here.\n\nThere are four main internationally recognised rex breeds: Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, LaPerm, and Selkirk Rex.\n\nThere are also a number of rarer, less well known or developing rex-coated breeds, including the German Rex, Ural Rex, Tennessee Rex, Tasman Rex group and Skookum. Spontaneous rexed variants have also been observed in breeds such as the Maine Coon and Persian as well as in random-bred cats such as the Ohio Rex, Oregon Rex and California Rex, however there has been no significant attempt to develop or seek recognition for these varieties and most have died out. A number of experimental breeds have been developed from the main 4 rex breeds, such as the German-bred Pudelkatze (Poodle Cat), now believed to be extinct. The Tennessee Rex is a natural mutation breed of cat dating back to 2004. It was discovered by Franklin Whittenburg. \n\nRex breeds vary considerably in appearance, from the elegant slender build of the Cornish Rex to the larger, cobby and heavy-boned Selkirk Rex. Each results from a separate mutation rather than being bred from a common ancestor. Each mutation causes the hair follicles to be oval in shape, instead of the normal regular round form, which results in hairs curling round as they grow instead of growing straight. Many of the other spontaneously occurring rex mutations have occurred and some have proven to be the same gene as the main four breeds. Some of those mutations, such as the Dutch Rex, were found to have unmanageable or unattractive fur and were not pursued as breeds.\n\nThe name Rex was taken from the Rabbit Fancy because the first rex cat breed to be developed, the Cornish Rex, has a coat similar to that of a rex rabbit, in that it comprises only the undercoat with no topcoat or guard hairs.\n\n\nRex Syrian Hamsters first appeared in the 1970s, it's characterised by Curly Whiskers and a Curly Coat, the curls in the coat are easily visible in Short Coated Hamsters but more difficult to see in Long Coated Hamsters.\n\nRex in Campbell Dwarf Hamsters isn't recorded as to when it first appeared. Unlike with Syrian Hamsters, the Rex Coat in Campbell is commonly very sparse and gives a bald appearance to it. The whiskers are curled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their origin is uncertain, but they may have evolved out of the pharmaceutical use of sugar, as they were a miniature version of comfits. The French name has been interpreted to mean they were \"without equal\" for intricate decoration of cakes, desserts, and other sweets, and the elaborate pièces montées constructed as table ornaments.\n\nThe term \"nonpareil\" can also refer to a specific confection made using nonpareils, namely, flat discs of chocolate coated with nonpareils, which are also known as chocolate nonpareils and freckles in Australia.\n\nAn 18th-century American recipe for a frosted wedding cake calls for nonpareils as decoration. By the early 19th century, colored nonpareils seem to have been available in the U.S. The popular cookbook author Eliza Leslie suggests the use of red and green nonpareils for decorating a Queen cake, but strongly suggests \"white\" nonpareils are most suitable for pink icing on a pound cake in her 1828 \"Seventy-five Recepts for Pastries, Cakes and Sweetmeats\".\n\nIn 1844, Eleanor Parkinson, of a well-known Philadelphia family of professional confectioners, first published her book \"The Complete Confectioner\", in which she described how to make nonpareils following her comfit-making procedure, which involved multiple hot pots and hot syrup.\n\nGörlitz, Germany was the birthplace of the German version of nonpareils, popularly known in Germany as \"liebesperlen\" (German: \"love pearls\"). Invented by confectioner Rudolf Hoinkis (1876–1944), the name derives from a conversation Hoinkis had with his wife, proclaiming he loved her like these \"pearls,\" the nonpareil. Unsure of what to call the treat he invented, his wife suggested calling them \"love pearls\", and the name stuck. The factory where he first manufactured the treat, founded in 1896, is now run by his great-grandson, Mathias.\n\nIn the United States, traditional nonpareils gave way for most purposes by the mid 20th century to \"sprinkles\" (known in some parts as \"jimmies\"), confections nearly as small but usually oblong rather than round and soft rather than brittle. Like nonpareils, their function is more decorative than gustatory as their actual taste is indistinct, and the products they are applied to are usually themselves very high in sugar. Candy-covered anise seeds called muisjes, sometimes mistaken for traditional nonpareils, are sometimes offered at breakfast in the Netherlands to be served on bread and butter. They are, however, usually served on rusk to celebrate the birth of a child. This is known as \"beschuit met muisjes.\"\n\nIn the UK, Australia and New Zealand, nonpareils are known as \"hundreds-and-thousands.\" In Australia and New Zealand, they are often eaten on top of patty cakes or on buttered bread as fairy bread, as festive items at children's birthday parties.\n\nThe term \"nonpareils\" can also refer to a specific confection: a round flat chocolate drop with the upper surface coated with nonpareils. This confection is also referred to as \"chocolate nonpareils.\" Nestlé makes a variety marketed as Sno-Caps. In Australia, these confections are commonly known as \"chocolate freckles,\" or simply \"freckles.\" Nonpareils are also sold in the United Kingdom as \"Jazzles,\" \"Jazzies,\" \"jazz drops\" and \"Snowies\" (the latter being of the white chocolate variety).\n\n"}

If \"dikwors\" is to be used, it is usually flattened to provide a larger surface area for drying.\n\nThe recipe used for these dried sausages is similar to that for boerewors, though pork and veal are usually replaced by beef, as the former can go rancid when dried, mutton fat replaces the pork fat used in boerewors. Drying makes the sausage ideal for unrefrigerated storage.\n\nDroëwors is unusual among dried meats in being dried quickly in warm, dry conditions, unlike traditional droge worst\nItalian cured salumi, which are dried slowly in relatively cold and humid conditions. A further difference is that droëwors does not contain curing agent as found in a traditional cured sausage. A direct result of this is that droëwors should not be kept in moist conditions as mold can begin to form more easily than would happen with a cured sausage.\n\nThis product is related both in name and in nature to the Dutch droge worst a.k.a. metworst.\n\n"}

In modern archaeology, the term \"seax\" is used specifically for a type of sword or dagger typical of the Germanic peoples of the Migration period and the Early Middle Ages, especially the Saxons, whose name derives from the weapon.\n\nIn heraldry, the \"seax\" is a charge consisting of a curved sword with a notched blade, appearing, for example, in the coats of arms of Essex and the former Middlesex.\n\nOld English \"seax, sax\" and Old Frisian \"sax\" are identical with Old Saxon and Old High German \"saks\", all from a Common Germanic \"*sahsą\" from a root \"*sah, *sag-\" \"to cut\" (also in saw, from a PIE root *sek-). In Scandinavia, the words \"sax\", \"saks\" or \"sakset\" all refer to scissors, which are used for cutting various materials.\n\nThe term \"scramaseax\" or \"scramsax\" (lit. \"wounding-knife\") is sometimes used for disambiguation, even though it is not attested in Old English, but taken from an occurrence of \"scramasaxi\" in Gregory of Tours' \"History of the Franks\".\n\nThe name of the roofer's tool, the \"zax\", is a development from this word.\n\nAmongst the shape and construction of seaxes there is a great deal of variation. The most frequent characteristics are:\n\n\nIn the continental Germanic area, the following types are defined for seaxes between roughly 450 and 800 AD, in chronological order:\n\nThe general trend, as one moves from the short to the broad seax, is that the blade becomes heavier, longer, broader and thicker. Long seaxes, which arrived at the end of the 7th century, were the longest of the seax. These were narrower and lighter than their predecessors. Initially, these weapons were found in combination with double-edged swords and were probably intended as side arm. From the 7th century onwards, seaxes became the main edged weapon (next to a francisca), sometimes in combination with small side-knives.\n\nThe rest of Europe (except for parts of Scandinavia) followed a similar development, although some types may not be very common depending on location. In England long seaxes appear later than on the continent and finds of long seaxes (as opposed to knives) remain very rare in comparison to finds of swords throughout the period.\n\nAnother typical form of the seax is the so-called broken-back style seax. These seaxes have a sharp angled transition between the back section of the blade and the point, the latter generally forming 1/3 to 3/5 of the blade length, exactly like a large version of a modern clip-point blade. These seaxes exist both in long seax variety (edge and back parallel) and in smaller blades of various lengths (blade expanding first, then narrowing towards the tip after the kink). They occurred mostly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with some examples in Germany around 8th-11th century. Some examples have pattern welded blades, while others have inlays of silver, copper, brass, etc.\n\n\n"}

However, Alpha-Bits reappeared for sale in January 2008 with a new formulation, touting \"0% Sugar!\" as a \"Limited Edition\" cereal. The old recipe was reintroduced later in 2008.

{"id": "2071932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2071932", "title": "Phosphoric acids and phosphates", "text": "Phosphoric acids and phosphates\n\nThere are various kinds of phosphoric acids and phosphates. Of the many phosphorus oxoacids, the phosphoric acids constitute the largest and most diverse group. The simplest phosphoric acid series begins with monophosphoric (orthophosphoric) acid, continues with many oligophosphoric acids such as diphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid and concludes in the polyphosphoric acids. But, phosphoric acid units can bind together into rings or cyclic structures, chains (catenas), or branched structures, with various combinations possible. Each of these can form phosphates (salts or esters of phosphoric acids).\n\nThe simplest compound of a series of phosphoric acids is sometimes called by its common name, orthophosphoric acid, but more often called by its IUPAC name, simply phosphoric acid, by both non-technical people and even many chemists. It has also been called monophosphoric acid. The chemical formula of orthophosphoric acid is HPO and its chemical structure is shown in the illustration below. Two or more orthophosphoric acid molecules can be joined by condensation into larger molecules by elimination of water. This way, a series of polyphosphoric acids can be obtained.\n\nOrthophosphoric acid has three hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen atoms in its structure. All three hydrogens are acidic to varying degrees and can be lost from the molecule as H ions (alternatively referred to as protons). When all three H ions are lost from orthophosphoric acid, an orthophosphate ion (PO) is formed. Orthophosphate is the simplest in a series of phosphates, and is usually just called phosphate by both non-technical people and many chemists alike; see a separate article on phosphate for details.\n\nBecause orthophosphoric acid can undergo as many as three dissociations or ionizations (losses of H ions), it has three acid dissociation constants called K, K, and K. Another way to provide acid dissociation constant data is to list pK, pK, and pK instead. Orthophosphate is in a sense the triple conjugate base of phosphoric acid and has three related basicity constants, K, K, and K, which likewise have corresponding pK, pK, and pK values.\n\nWhen two orthophosphoric acid molecules are condensed into one molecule, pyrophosphoric acid (HPO) is obtained as follows:\n\nThe chemical structure of pyrophosphoric acid is also shown in the illustration. Three orthophosphoric acid molecules can condense in a row to obtain tripolyphosphoric acid (HPO), which is also shown in the illustration. This condensation process can continue with additional orthophosphoric acid units to obtain tetrapolyphosphoric acid (HPO, pictured) and so on. Note that each extra phosphoric unit adds 1 extra H (hydrogen) atom, 1 extra P (phosphorus) atom, and 3 extra O (oxygen) atoms. The \"backbone\" chain of these types of molecules consists of alternating P and O atoms covalently bonded together. Polyphosphoric acid molecules can have dozens of such phosphoric units bonded in a row. A general formula for such poly-acid compounds is HO(POOH)H, where x = number of phosphoric units in the molecule. The four oxygen atoms bonded to each phosphorus atom are in a tetrahedral configuration with the phosphorus in the center of the tetrahedron and the oxygens in each of the four corners.\n\nPolyphosphoric acids are used in organic synthesis for cyclizations and acylations.\n\nIn a pyrophosphoric acid molecule, there are four hydrogens bonded to oxygens, and one, two, three, or all four can be lost as H ions. When all four are lost from pyrophosphoric acid, a pyrophosphate ion is formed. Because pyrophosphoric acids can undergo four dissociations, there are four K values for it, as well as four corresponding pK values. Similarly, pyrophosphate is a base with four K and, of course, four pK values for regaining the H ions in reverse order.\n\nThe situation with higher order polyphosphoric acids and polyphosphates continues in a similar way. Tripolyphosphoric acid can lose up to five H ions to form a tripolyphosphate ion, tetrapolyphosphoric acid can lose up to six H ions to form tetrapolyphosphate, etc. As more dissociations per molecule are possible, the intervals between individual pK and pK values now start becoming smaller on the pH scale.\n\nAs the polyphosphoric molecules grow increasingly larger and more complex, practically any number of the somewhat acidic -OH groups in them can dissociate to become negatively charged oxygens, forming numerous combinations of multiple-charged polyphosphoric/polyphosphate anions. Generally in an aqueous solution, the degree or percentage of dissociation depends on the pH of the solution.\n\nOrtho-, pyro-, and tripolyphosphate compounds have been commonly used in detergents (i. e. cleaners) formulations. For example, see Sodium tripolyphosphate. Sometimes pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, tetrapolyphosphate, etc. are called diphosphate, triphosphate, tetraphosphate, etc., especially when they are part of phosphate esters in biochemistry. They are also used for scale and corrosion control by potable water providers. As a corrosion inhibitor, polyphosphates work by forming a protective film on the interior surface of pipes.\n\nThe phosphoric acid units can be bonded together in rings (cyclic structures) forming metaphosphoric acid molecules. The simplest such compound is trimetaphosphoric acid or cyclo-triphosphoric acid having the formula HPO. Its structure is shown in the illustration. Since the ends are condensed, its formula has one less HO (water) than tripolyphosphoric acid. What are commonly called trimetaphosphates actually have a mixture of ring sizes. A general formula for such cyclic compounds is (HPO) where x = number of phosphoric units in the molecule. The hypothetical monomer monometaphosphoric acid (HPO), which would be valence isoelectronic with nitric acid, is not known to exist.\n\nWhen these metaphosphoric acids lose their hydrogens as H, cyclic anions called metaphosphates are formed. An example of a compound with such an anion is sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO), used as a sequestrant and a food additive.\n\nThe third -OH group on an orthophosphoric acid unit can also be used for condensation with other phosphoric groups to form branches in the polyphosphoric/polyphosphate chains. The simplest example of this is triphosphono phosphate, a branched isomer of tetrapolyphosphoric acid. The ultimate example of cyclic and branching condensation would be the cyclic four-phosphate unit double-branched to form the phosphoric anhydride PO; see illustration.\n\nThese phosphoric acids series are generally water-soluble considering the polarity of the molecules. Ammonium and alkali phosphates are also quite soluble in water. The alkaline earth salts start becoming less soluble and phosphate salts of various other metals are even less soluble. In aqueous solutions (solutions of water), water gradually (over the course of hours) hydrolyzes polyphosphates into smaller phosphates and finally into ortho-phosphate, given enough water. Higher temperature or acidic conditions can speed up the hydrolysis reactions considerably.\n\nConversely, polyphosphoric acids or polyphosphates are often formed by dehydrating a phosphoric acid solution; in other words, removing water from it often by heating and evaporating the water off.\n\nThe -OH groups in phosphoric acids can also condense with the hydroxyl groups of alcohols to form phosphate esters. Since orthophosphoric acid has three -OH groups, it can esterify with one, two, or three alcohol molecules to form a mono-, di-, or triester. See the general structure image of an ortho- (or mono-) phosphate ester below on the left, where any of the R groups can be a hydrogen or an organic radical. Pyro- (or di-) phosphate esters and tripoly- (or tri-) phosphate esters, etc. are also possible. Any -OH groups on the phosphates in these ester molecules may lose H ions to form anions, again depending on the pH in a solution.

As of 2001 the cereal got a new recipe with real creme filling. A variation of Oreo O's called Extreme Creme Taste Oreo O's contained Oreo filling-flavored marshmallows.\n\nThe cereal was launched in 1997 and discontinued in 2007 everywhere outside South Korea. In May 2017, Post Cereals announced that it would restart production of Oreo O's indefinitely starting June 23.\n\nSeveral advertisements were run on television for Oreo O's during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The variation Extreme Crème Oreo O's had its own television commercial starring the \"Créme Team,\" a troupe of humanoid marshmallows sporting sunglasses, in 2001. The advertisement promoted the Extreme Crème Oreo O's variation as more chocolatey in taste, and more creamy.\n\nThe cereal was a joint product from Post Cereals and Kraft Foods, which allowed both companies to share the rights, distribution and profits after 1997. The cereal was very successful when it came to sales, and parental approval as a suitable breakfast food. In 2007, both companies ceased co-branding, which made the cereal impossible to produce. Kraft foods owned the copyrights to the name Oreo, yet Post owned the copyrights to the cereal recipe itself. Neither company wished to relinquish either rights; therefore forcing the cereal to become discontinued worldwide.\n\nDue to an international loop hole with the rights of Oreo O's, they were only produced and available in South Korea, with boxes of the product being available for international purchase on eBay from third-party sellers for well over $10. Korean food manufacturer Dongsuh Foods was established as a joint venture of General Foods and Dongsuh Companies Inc., and had distribution rights to produce Post Foods cereals in Korea. When Kraft Foods acquired General Foods, half of Dongsuh Foods' stock automatically became property of Kraft, thus making Dongsuh Foods the only company with both licenses required to make Post Foods and Oreo O's. The product was recalled in 2014 due to Dongsuh having intentionally diluted E. coli-contaminated product with normal product. In September 2016, Dongsuh resumed selling Oreo O's within South Korea when it spun off from General Foods.\n\nIn early 2017, a subsidiary company of Post, Malt-O-Meal Cereals, continued selling the cereal in the United States as a market test. The only differences were that the marshmallows from the 2001 version weren't included, the cereal contained artificial flavors and it didn't use the Oreo name for licensing reasons. Instead, the cereal was called \"Cookies & Cream\", and was sold in bags in many Walmart stores. Due to high sales and a marketing deal made by Walmart, Post announced that Nabisco will once again co-brand. Soon after, Oreo O's were rereleased with its original 1997 recipe worldwide as a Walmart Exclusive Product, including the United States on June 23. As of 2018, the cereal is now available in all grocery stores.\n\nThe cereal made an appearance in \"Daddy Day Care\" as one of the cereals in the cereal aisle at the supermarket.\nIt was also on top of Joey's fridge in \"Friends\" for nearly the entire run of the show. It has also become a major staple in the \"90's Kids\" fandom, along with other formerly-discontinued foods including \"Surge (drink)\" and \"French Toast Crunch\".\n\n\n"}

It consists of honey-flavored corn cereal bits in a honeycomb shape.\n\nAt the end of 2006, Post changed the formula for this popular cereal to improve its health content. This change, although tested by Post beforehand to positive reviews, received mainly negative reviews from consumers.\n\nFollowing this public response, in March 2007, Kraft Foods (then-owner of Post Cereals) introduced a new \"Improved Taste\" version of the cereal that, the company claimed, would improve \"the cereal's taste, texture and appearance while incorporating key nutritional benefits to the product.\" \n\nThree variations have been marketed, Strawberry Blasted Honeycomb, which added strawberry flavoring, and Chocolate Honeycomb, with chocolate flavoring in the pieces. A variety called Cinna-Graham Honeycomb added cinnamon flavor to the cereal.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, Post reformulated its Honeycomb cereal recipe. Reviews of the cereal on retailer websites such as Amazon and Walmart posted after the reformulation date were almost universally negative, 1-star complaints about the new recipe. In April 2018, after refusing to comment on the recipe change since it has been released, Post began replying to customer complaints that they would be returning to the old recipe at some point during the summer of 2018.\n\nThe product's ingredients are listed as:\n\nThe product's ingredients prior to May 2017 are listed as:\n\nWhen Bran Blend, defined as whole grain corn flour and corn bran, was included in the ingredient list, the fiber content was tripled (from 1g to 3g per serving). This put the cereal in Kraft's Sensible Solution program.\n\nOriginally, the animated Honeycomb Kid (a cowboy) was the cereal's mascot. The cereal's jingle was borrowed from the song \"Honeycomb\", a 1957 hit for Jimmie Rodgers.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, television commercials featured visitors to a children's clubhouse called the Honeycomb Hideout in which the visitor had arrived, initially hostile, and exclaimed a need for a \"big\" taste. Then, the kids had introduced the visitor to the cereal, winning over the visitor, examining the size of the cereal bits with a tape measure and singing the jingle:\n\nDuring the 1980s, the cereal offered the Honeycomb Hideout Club for children, distributing badges, membership cards and clubhouse toy incentives on specially marked box tops.\n\nThe jingle was spoofed on the \"Futurama\" episode entitled \"The Sting\" in 2003.\n\nHoneycomb Kid sought what he called \"The Honeycomb Secret.\" Honeycomb Kid had learned from his prior adventures that the secret consisted of three separate parts: The first was the Crunch, the second was the Shape, however the third and most important answer had always eluded him. In the last installment of his first commercial appearances, Honeycomb Kid discovers the third component of the Honeycomb secret to be the Taste.\n\nA new set of Honeycomb Kid commercials were made in the 1980s where a child athlete would get done practicing then come up to a table with Honeycomb cereal, exclaim it was his or her favorite cereal, to where the older guys at the table would somewhat mock the \"little kid\" or \"little guy\" for wanting \"big Honeycomb\", to where the kid would go, \"Little kid (guy)?! Watch this!\" then go and show off his or her skills to them, thoroughly impressing them (saying \"Big stuff!\" and \"Honeycomb kid!\" as they watch) and being accepted by them (\"I didn't know you were a Honeycomb kid!\") and the commercial ends with the kid happily eating a bowl of Honeycomb.\n\nIn 1995, a mascot, Crazy Craving, was introduced as a wild-haired, marsupial-like cartoon character who rabidly craves Honeycomb cereal and whom children in the commercials transform into. Its catch-phrase was \"Me Want Honeycomb\". The name Crazy Craving means that the character is the anthropomorphism of hunger.\n\nA more recent commercial introduces Bernard, a boy raised by bees. He is found and attempted to be socialized. Although he had clearly been a feral child, he apparently cannot argue the fact that he is a 'bee' not a 'boy,' and he enjoys honeycombs. In a later commercial, a man gives a safari-like tour for the bee boy, luring him with honeycombs. In a commercial released in 2010, a second bee boy was introduced played by Canadian actor Joel Cox.\n\nHoneycomb was famous in the 1980s for their annual mini-license plate giveaway, where a miniature state license plate was free inside a box, with the ability to order the whole set. One year, Post also included plates that said \"LUCKY\" and the finder of those plates won a BMX bike. The commercial for this showed a girl winning and later riding the BMX bike, which was considered somewhat unusual for the time.\n\n"}

Over-ripened kimchi can also be used for cooking \"kimchi jjigae\". Indeed, well-fermented kimchi and chilled rice can produce a flavor of greater richness as opposed to freshly made kimchi and rice.

Without completing the process, the resultant dish can be mushy in texture.\n\nAlong with kimchi and rice, kimchi fried rice can contain many kinds of ingredients. Pork or spam are the most common; however, beef, chicken, bacon, or ham can be used. Instead of meat, canned tuna, shrimp, or mushrooms can be used as a replacement, in which case the ingredient's name may be prefixed to the dish's name such as \"\"beoseot-kimchi-bokkeum-bap\"\" (hangul: 버섯김치볶음밥, literally \"mushroom kimchi fried rice\"). Meat ingredients are chopped into the dish together with vegetables such as onion, carrot or zucchini. However, ingredients depend on personal preference and occasion. A small amount of minced garlic and sliced green pepper can be used as seasoning. These ingredients are fried in a pan with a little vegetable or sesame oil.\n\nAfter the cooked dish is put on a plate or in a bowl, a fried egg is sometimes served on top. Thinly shredded gim, chopped scallions or sesame are spread over it to enhance the flavor and to garnish.\n\nSince kimchi fried rice is cheap and easy to make in a short period of time, it is favored by students living alone who can not afford expensive meals. Kimchi fried rice is also a popular item for lunch at a \"bunsikjeom\" (\"bunsik place\"). As the dish is hot and spicy, it is typically served with danmuji and a small bowl of any kind of mild and warm soup such as \"miyeok-guk\" (\"wakame soup\"), or \"kongnamul-guk\" (\"soybean sprout soup\"). During summer, cool \"dongchimi\" (white, watery kimchi made of radish) can also be accompanied with the dish.\n\nThe popularity of kimchi fried rice is also reflected in South Korean pop culture. Byun Jin-sub, a popular male singer in the late 1980s, sang a song titled \"Wishes\" (hangul: 희망사항) in which he stated that the singer's ideal girlfriend would be one who cooks good kimchi fried rice. Taeyang says in his 2010 song \"I Need A Girl\" that his ideal girlfriend will eat the kimchi fried rice that he cooks.\n\n\n"}

Made with simple ingredients, frybread can be eaten alone or with various toppings such as honey, jam, powdered sugar, venison, or beef. Frybread can also be made into tacos, like Navajo tacos.\nAccording to Navajo tradition, frybread was created in 1864 using the flour, sugar, salt and lard that was given to them by the United States government when the Navajo, who were living in Arizona, were forced to make the 300-mile journey known as the \"Long Walk\" and relocate to Bosque Redondo, New Mexico onto land that could not easily support their traditional staples of vegetables and beans.\n\nFor many Native Americans, \"frybread links generation with generation and also connects the present to the painful narrative of Native American history\". It is often served both at home and at gatherings. The way it is served varies from region to region and different tribes have different recipes. It can be found in its many ways at state fairs and pow-wows, but what is served to the paying public may be different from what is served in private homes and in the context of tribal family relations.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that a plate of fry bread consists of 700 Calories and 27 grams of fat.\n\nA typical frybread recipe consists of flour, water, salt, a small amount of oil, and baking powder. The ingredients are mixed and worked into a simple dough, and covered with a cloth for 30 minutes to an hour, until the dough rises. It is then formed into small balls, and are either rolled or pulled into flat discs prior to frying in hot oil. Many variations of this basic recipe exist, including substituting mayonnaise for oil in the dough (which produces a crisp, crunchy texture that resists getting soggy - ideal for Navajo tacos), and leavening the dough with a small container of yogurt or soured milk instead of using baking powder or yeast (produces a rich, sourdough flavor but requires several hours to fully leaven after the dough is prepared). Most frybread recipes do not use yeast at all because it was not typically available to Native peoples when this foodstuff was developed. In many Native American households, frybread dough is mixed early in the morning and left in a large bowl covered with a cloth to leaven and is used throughout the day to prepare fresh bread when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is an Italian-American dish and is related to various regional fish soups and stews of Italian cuisine.\n\nCioppino is traditionally made from the catch of the day, which in San Francisco is typically a combination of Dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels and fish, all sourced from salt-water ocean, in this case the Pacific. The seafood is then combined with fresh tomatoes in a wine sauce.\n\nThe dish can be served with toasted bread, either local sourdough or French bread. The bread acts as a starch, similar to a pasta, and is dipped into the sauce.\n\nCioppino was developed in the late 1800s by Italian immigrants who fished off Meiggs Wharf and lived in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco, many from the port city of Genoa. When a fisherman came back empty handed, they would walk around with a pot to the other fishermen asking them to chip in whatever they could. What ever ended up in the pot became their Cioppino. The fishermen that chipped in expected the same treatment if they came back empty handed in the future. It later became a staple as Italian restaurants proliferated in San Francisco.\n\nThe name comes from \"ciuppin\" which is the name of a classic soup from the Italian region Liguria, similar in flavor to cioppino but with less tomato and using Mediterranean seafood cooked to the point that it falls apart.\n\nThe dish also shares its origin with other regional Italian variations of seafood stew similar to \"ciuppin\", including \"cacciucco\" from Tuscany, \"brodetto di pesce\" from Abruzzo and others. Similar dishes can be found in coastal regions throughout the Mediterranean, from Portugal to Greece. Examples of these include \"suquet de peix\" from Catalan-speaking regions and \"bouillabaisse\" from Provence.\n\nThe earliest printed description of cioppino is from a 1901 recipe in \"The San Francisco Call\", though the stew is called \"chespini\". \"Cioppino\" first appears in 1906 in \"The Refugee's Cookbook\", a fundraising effort to benefit San Franciscans displaced by the 1906 earthquake and fire.\n\nGenerally the seafood is cooked in broth and served in the shell, including the crab, which is often served halved or quartered. It therefore requires special utensils, typically a crab fork and cracker. Depending on the restaurant, it may be accompanied by a bib to prevent food stains on clothing, a damp napkin and a second bowl for the shells. A variation, commonly called \"lazy man's cioppino\", is served with shells pre-cracked or removed.\n\n\n"}

Schmidt in 1926. It is a variation of traditional Welsh rarebit and was one of two signature sandwiches created by chefs at the Brown Hotel shortly after its founding in 1923. It was created to serve as an alternative to ham and egg late-night suppers.\n\nThe Hot Brown is an open-faced sandwich of turkey and bacon, covered in Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Many Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce instead of the Mornay.\n\nMore common alternatives to the Hot Brown include using Cheddar cheese or American cheese for the sauce. Alternatives for garnishes include tomatoes, mushroom slices, and, very rarely, canned peaches.\n\nWhen Fred K. Schmidt created the Hot Brown, its sliced roast turkey was a rarity, as turkey was usually reserved for holiday feasts. The original Hot Brown included the sliced turkey on an open-faced white toast sandwich, with Mornay sauce covering it, with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, completed by being oven-broiled until bubbly. Pimento and bacon strips were then added to it. After its debut, it quickly became the choice of ninety-five percent of the customers to the Brown Hotel's restaurant.\n\nThe dish is a local specialty and favorite of the Louisville area, and is popular throughout Kentucky. It was long unavailable at its point of origin, as the Brown Hotel was shut down from 1971 to 1985.\n\nThe \"cold brown\" was baked poultry (chicken or turkey), hard-boiled egg, lettuce, and tomato open-faced on rye bread, and covered with Thousand Island dressing.

It was started in 1956 and became a bimonthly magazine in December 1956 in Chicago. The magazine was acquired by M. Frank Jones in Kansas City, Missouri in 1965. Jones was owner, editor and publisher until 1970, when \"Bon Appétit\" was merged into the Pillsbury Company, who sold it to Knapp Communications, publishers of \"Architectural Digest\", four years later. Condé Nast Publications, the current owners, purchased Knapp Communications in 1993. Its sister publication was \"Gourmet\", before the latter was discontinued in October 2009. The magazine's headquarters, which had been in Los Angeles, CA, were moved to New York City in early 2011.\n\nThe current editor is Adam Rapoport, previously Style Editor at Condé Nast's \"GQ\" magazine. Prior to joining \"GQ\", Rapoport edited the restaurant section at \"Time Out New York\" and worked as an editor and writer for the James Beard Foundation's publications office.\n\nFor the print edition, Condé Nast reported 1,452,953 paid subscriptions and 88,516 single copies in 2012 for the period ending November 2012.

Also, 46% of readers have college degrees and 36% are professional or managerial employment. 59% are married.\n\n\"Bon Appétit\"s \"Bite me\" advertising campaign had an estimated $500,000 budget that included print and online ads, billboards, posters, and a sweepstakes. The ad campaign came after a period of \"sluggish performance\" since its sibling magazine \"Gourmet\" was canceled in 2009, during which a limited number of readers and advertisers shifted to \"Bon Appétit\". During the same period, other food magazines, such as \"Every Day With Rachael Ray\" and \"Food Network Magazine\" thrived. \"Bon Appétit\" sold 632 ad pages in 2012, which is a one percent increase from 625 ad pages sold in 2009 but a decline of 27 percent from the 867 ad pages sold in 2008.\n\n\nSince 2009, \"Bon Appétit\"'s Deputy and Restaurant Editor Andrew Knowlton, later joined by Senior Editor Julia Kramer, has put together a list of the Best New Restaurant in the US.

The shape of Stax is a simple curve called a hyperbolic cylinder, while Pringles are formed into a double-curve known as a hyperbolic paraboloid. Stax chips have the flavoring spread across the inside curve of the crisp whilst Pringles have them across the outside curve.

The traditional mix includes chervil, arugula, leafy lettuces and endive, while the term \"mesclun\" may also refer to a blend that might include some or all of these four and baby spinach, Swiss chard (silver beet), mustard greens, dandelion, frisée, mizuna, mâche (lamb's lettuce), radicchio, sorrel, or other fresh leaf vegetables.\n\nThe term \"mesclun\" for a mixture of young salad greens is quite recent, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary first used in 1976. Of Provençal dialect origin, it derives from the verb \"mesclar\", to \"mix thoroughly\" and literally means \"mixture\". According to local lore, mesclun originated with the farmers around Nice, who would each bring their own unique and prized mix of baby greens to the farmers' markets. One of the most representative and authentic versions combined baby dandelion, lettuce and rocket.\n\nNoted chef Alice Waters comments, \"Outdoor markets in Provence display \"mesclun\" in profusion, a \"melange\" of the first tender young leaves which appear in the garden. \"Mesclun \"can be an extraordinary lettuce mixture: rocket, much like the rugola (arugula) found in Italian markets, chervil, mâche or lamb's lettuce and oak leaf. On occasion, baby curly endive (chicory) or young dandelion greens find their way into the medley, depending solely upon the grower's personal preferences combined with the reality of whatever else might send up shoots in the spot where \"mesclun\" grows.\"\n\nIn the North American foodservice industry, the first appearance of \"mesclun\" traces to restaurants and farm stands in the early 1980s, with a rise in popularity since. A \"mesclun mix\" can be described as comprising baby leaves of lettuces and other greens (and often herbs) in a wide range of leaf shapes, colors, textures and tastes. While the overwhelming amount of mesclun sold approximates the traditional blend of chervil, arugula, leafy lettuces and endive, depending on the season, anywhere from a dozen to three dozen different varieties of baby greens, including red and green oak leaves, romaine and lolla rossa lettuces, frisée, tatsoi, bok choy (joi choi), arugula, spinach, orach, mizuna, dandelion, mustard greens and garden cress may comprise what is commercially referred to as a \"Spring mix\". When available, locally grown, direct-from-the-farmer sourcing is recommended over commercial bulk packs for best flavor and freshness.\n\n"}

This meaning is also present in other European languages. For example, the Italian \"torta\", German \"torte\" or French \"tarte\". In Mexico, the sweet cake is normally referred to as \"pastel\", which is also used in other parts of Latin America with this meaning. \"Huevo en torta\" (not to be confused with \"torta de huevo\") is a typical pastry from Sobrarbe, Aragon, Spain.\n\nIn the southern Philippines, \"torta\" is generally used to refer to small cakes. It usually refers to \"mamón\" or \"torta mamón\", a native porous sponge cake delicacy that resembles a large cupcake with butter, sugar, and/or cheese on top, traditionally served with \"sikwate\" (a thick, hot drink made of ground roasted cacao seeds) for afternoon snack or merienda.\n\n\"Torta\" in Spain originated in different regional variants of flatbread, of which the \"torta de gazpacho\" and \"torta cenceña\" are still surviving in certain areas of Central Spain. Tortas are also mentioned in Leviticus 24:5-9, in the Spanish translation of the Bible. Presently, however, the word \"torta\" is also applied to different kinds of bread and pastry products according to the region.\n\nHistorically, the difference between \"torta\" and bread was its round and flat shape, as well as the use of baking soda/powder as the proofing agent instead of yeast. In most regions, a \"torta\" was traditionally considered an inferior form of bread, as the well known Spanish aphorism expresses:\n\nIn turn, in Mexico a variation says: \"A falta de pan, tortillas\" (\"Where there is no bread, \"tortillas\" are fine\"). However, the term \"torta\" in Mexico typically refers to a sandwich made with bread (see Mexico section, below, for more details).\n\n\"Torta frita\" is a fried flatbread eaten in Uruguay, Argentina and the Chilean Patagonia.\n\nIn the northern Philippines, particularly among Tagalog-speaking provinces and islands, \"torta\" refers to a kind of omelette made with eggs or eggplant, ground meat (usually beef or pork), and sometimes minced onion and potato.\n\nTortas can be served any time during the day. There are many variations on Filipino tortas, such as:\n\n\n\"Torta de huevo\" is a small fried mixture of scrambled eggs, usually eaten sandwiched in bread.\n\nIn Italian, “” means simply cake, however sweet or savoury. However, in the US, it came to have a different meaning within the Italian-American community.\n\nThe Italian \"torta\" is differentiated from \"crostata\" by the filling: a \"crostata\" has an inconsistent chunky filling, whereas a \"torta\" has a consistent filling made of blended ingredients.\n\nSome falsely believe that an Italian crust torta is a combination of layered cheeses and tomatoes to be spread onto bread. Italian torta is a pie similar to quiche and served as a brunch item. However, torta is different than quiche as the crust is mostly made of cheese, not egg. The crust can also be made from pizza dough. Ingredients vary as there are many variations of this torta. Traditional Italian torta usually includes ricotta cheese, parmesan, parsley, and onion. There are also variations that contain meat and some that are completely vegetarian. These vegetarian torte sometimes contain artichokes and spices for flavor. This torta is made in a springform pan instead of a traditional pie pan.\n\nTorta in Brazil and other Portuguese speaking countries refers to a pie which can be a sweet or savory dish.\n\nTorta in Malta means a pie, which can be sweet or savoury. \n\nMost “tortas” are generally savoury, with a classic Maltese dish being “torta tal-lampuki” (lampuki, singular lampuka, are a type of common fish found in Maltese waters).\n\nA common example of a sweet Maltese torta is “torta tal-lewz” (lewz, singular lewza, means almonds in Maltese. Almonds are a very common ingredient in Maltese cuisine, although some people prefer to use marzipan over almonds, either because of ease, taste preference or cost.\n\nIn Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, people typically refer to dessert cakes as \"tortas.\"\n\nIn Mexico, a \"torta\" is a kind of sandwich, served on an oblong 15 cm firm, crusty white sandwich roll. Depending on the region, this is called a bolillo, telera, birote, or \"pan francés\". Tortas can be eaten cold or hot, and grilled or toasted in a press in the same manner as a Cuban sandwich.\n\nGarnishes such as avocado, chili pepper (usually poblano or jalapeño), tomato, and onion are common. The dish is popular throughout Mexico, and is also available anywhere with a large Mexican population. In Northern Mexico, the \"torta\" is very frequently called lonche by influence of the English \"lunch\", as it may be eaten during lunch break.\n\nThe sandwich is normally named according to its main ingredient:\n\nThe \"torta ahogada\" (meaning \"drowned\" \"torta\") of Guadalajara is smothered in a red sauce. Different fillings are available and they may be mixed to create an original \"torta\".\n\nThe Torta Cubana is another take on the classic torta sandwich Mexico has been accredited for. As the name implies by meaning literally the \"Cuban Torta\", this sandwich is stuffed with a variety of meats that is dependent on where it is being made. This sandwich should not be confused for the Cuban sandwich by the similar name, the \"Cubano\" as the two sandwiches are not related. One may have come before the other, but this coincidence in names is not to be taken seriously as the Mexicans decided to name this dish after the street it was invented on, the \"Calle Republica de Cuba in Mexico City\". To add on to the contrasts, the breads used to make the sandwiches are different, and the condiments of the sandwiches varies. \n\nDue to the practicality of being hand-carried, \"tortas\" are sold at massive events, such as football matches, parades, and outdoor concerts, but they are also available for breakfast, lunch, or dinner at dedicated establishments or sold as street food by food carts.\n\nThe origin of the torta is unclear, but some claim it sprouted in Puebla due to Spanish-French interaction. \"Teleras\" (the bread usually used in tortas) were inspired by French baguettes.\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes mistaken as equivalent to Christian use of the word, \"sister.\" Ayya can refer to either a bhikkhuni (fully ordained and usually wearing orange or yellow robes in Southeast Asia) or a samaneri (shramanerika) ten-precept novice renunciant or a sikkhamana (wearing white, brown or sometimes pink), but not to non-ordained precept-holders.\n\nGenerally for bhikkhunis, robes would be maroon with yellow in Tibet; gray (for Mahayanans) or orange/yellow (for Theravadans) in Vietnam; gray in Korea; gray or black in China and Taiwan; black in Japan; orange or yellow in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. The colour of robes distinguishes both level of ordination and tradition, with white (usually worn by a male renunciant before ordination) or pink symbolising a state of ambiguity, being on the threshold of a decision, no longer secular and not yet monastic. A key exception to this is in the countries where women are not allowed to wear robes that signify full ordination, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and (Theravadans in) Vietnam. So, the majority of ayyas wear orange/yellow or white/pink.\n\nThere are very few fully ordained (bhikkhuni) ayyas in the 21st century because the Theravadan nuns' lineage was lost in most of Southeast Asia over the last 1,000 years. The Theravadan bhikkhuni lineage was reinstated in 1996 at Sarnath, India, by a quorum of Theravada monks and Korean nuns. Eleven Sinhalese dasa sil mata nuns took full bhikkhuni ordination in that ceremony, reviving the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order after 980 years of decline and dissipation. Theravadan ordination is available for women (as of 2006) in Sri Lanka, where many of the current bhikkhunis have been ordained. The ordination process has several stages, which can begin with anagarika (non-ordained) precepts and wearing white robes, but is as far as many women are allowed to take their practice. In Thailand, where it is illegal for women to take ordination, nearly all female monastics are known as maechis (also spelled \"mae chee\"), regardless of their level of attainment.\n\nAs awareness of the need for ordained women to study and practice grows, so does the support for female monks. There are very few places for an ayya to reside, once she ordains. The number of monasteries and viharas for women is still small, but increasing.\n\n"}

They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, Slovenia, as well as in North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Austria.\n\nĆevapi has its origins in the Balkans during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the köfte kebab.\n\nThey are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, feta cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian ćevapi are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand-mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serb ćevapčići are made of either beef, lamb or pork or mixed.\n\nThe word \"ćevap\" comes from Turkish \"kebab\", sometimes with the South Slavic diminutive ending \"-čići\" (Albanian: \"Qebapa/Qofte\"; Croatian: \"ćevapčići/ćevapi\"; Slovene: \"čevapčiči/čevapi\"; Bosnian, '; , '; , \"\", , ). The word ćevapi is plural; the singular form ćevap is rarely used, as a typical serving consists of several ćevapi.\n\nDuring the Ottoman administration, \"hajduks\" (rebels, outlaws) made the \"hajdučki ćevap\" (\"hajduk cevap\"), which was easy to make, out of pieces of meat and smoked lard on a skewer roasted over fire. The recipe of the \"Leskovački ćevap\" (\"Leskovac ćevap\"), a local specialty of Serbia, was based on traditional Pljeskavica (meat patty), formed as sausage (\"ćevap\"). Leskovac has a long history of grill shops. In Belgrade, ćevapčići first came from Leskovac in the 1860s, into the kafana \"Rajić\" at the Great Marketplace (today Studentski Trg), from where they quickly spread across the city, and subsequently, country. The industry quickly multiplied, as ćevapčići was the drinking public's favourite.\n\nThe ćevapčići were served at shops, known as \"ćevabdžija\" ( \"ćevabdžije\"). A 1927–28 study in Belgrade told that people either ate in the restaurant or outside (\"\"on the kaldrma\"\"), often take-away. The shops served from early morning to 10 AM, while often the dish was bought for breakfast.\n\nBefore the 1930s, they spread to the rest of Yugoslavia, including east of Serbia and the Macedonia region. By 1932, ćevapčići were regarded a local specialty in southern Serbia, Skopje and Peć. In 1933, the first street food vendor appeared in Maribor, Slovenia, who came from Leskovac, and served grilled meat, including ćevapčići. In 1940, ten pieces cost one Yugoslav dinar. In the second half of the 20th century, ćevapčići and other Oriental dishes entered Croatian cuisine. The Leskovac-styled grilled meat, including ćevapčići, have today become part of everyday-diet in Slovenia. Today, ćevapčići are found outside former Yugoslavia in the diaspora communities.\n\nToday, the grill shops are known as \"ćevabdžinica\" (pl. \"ćevabdžinice\").\n\nLeskovac organizes an annual grill festival, the Leskovac Grill Festival, as a showcase of ćevapi and other grilled meat.\n\nThey are usually served of 5-10 pieces on a plate or in a flatbread (\"lepinje\" or \"somun\"), often with chopped onions, sour cream, kajmak, ajvar, cottage cheese, minced red pepper and salt. Bosnian-type ćevapi (halal) are made from two types of minced beef meat, hand mixed and formed with a funnel, while formed ćevapi are grilled. Serbian-type ćevapi (ćevapčići) are made of either beef, lamb or pork, or mixed.\n\nIn Austria, Czech Republic and Slovakia, čevapčiči is generally served with mustard mixed with finely chopped raw onions and potatoes or French fries, in a common fast food manner.\n\n\nThere are variations in meat content and seasoning. The dish is kept simple, and traditionally served in somun with onions and/or kajmak and yogurt as appetizer.\n\n\n"}

One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water—either through laziness or accident. Another cites a storm which caused ocean water to wash over the candy, which was consequently (and successfully) marketed with the appropriate name. Joseph Fralinger popularized the candy by boxing it and selling it in Atlantic City. Fralinger's first major competition came from candy maker Enoch James, who refined the recipe, making it less sticky and easier to unwrap. James also cut the candy into bite-sized pieces, and is credited with mechanizing the \"pulling\" process. The candy was also sold mail order; in 1926 sheet music was commissioned by James with the title \"Send Home Some Taffy Today!\"/ Both Fralinger's and James's stores still operate on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Both companies have been owned and operated by the Glaser family since 1947.\n\nOn August 21, 1923, John Edmiston obtained a trademark for the name \"salt water taffy\" (number 172,016), then demanded royalties from companies using his newly acquired name. He was sued over this demand, and in 1925, the trademark was invalidated as being in common use.\n\nSalt water taffy is still sold widely on the boardwalks in Atlantic City (including shops in existence since the 1800s), nearby island Ocean City, and other popular beaches throughout the United States, especially Cape Cod, and Atlantic Canada, as well as in Salt Lake City, Utah. Taffy is also distributed throughout the U.S. to some specialty shops and markets, and other places where an especially wide and diverse variety of candy is sold. It is also available for mail order through Internet sources.\n\nSalt water taffy is composed of sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, glycerine, water, butter, salt, natural and/or artificial flavor, and food color.

It is the most common form of murtabak; which is egg-filled pancake, sometimes mixed with green onion and minced meat, made from pan fried crepes which is folded and cut to squares. In Indonesia, the Murtabak is one of the most popular street foods and is known as \"martabak\". There are two Indonesian versions: a savory with egg and meat, and a sweet one. In Indonesia, the savory beaten-egg filled martabak is called 'martabak telur\" — to differ it from 'martabak manis\", the sweet martabak folded pancake.\n\nLately, vegetarian murtabaks and other forms of murtabaks with chicken and other stuffings exist and can be found in many Indian Muslim restaurants in Singapore, they can be found in Little India area and those restaurants facing the Sultan Mosque near Arab Street.\n\nIn Malaysia, where it is called \"murtabak\", it was originally sold in Indian Muslim restaurants and stalls, and usually includes minced meat (beef or chicken, sometimes goat meat mutton along with garlic, egg and onion, and is eaten with curry or gravy, sliced cucumber, syrup-pickled onions or tomato sauce. The dish is sold throughout the country, with diverse variations in ingredients or cooking styles and has been adopted by Malay Muslim sellers as well. In Yemen, murtabak also usually includes goat meat mutton.\n\nThe word mutabbaq in Arabic means \"folded\". This suggested that Murtabak might be originated from Yemen, which has sizeable Indian population; through Indian traders it has spread back to their home countries. Murtabak was brought to Southeast Asia by Tamil Muslim trader. The dish referred to as \"murtabak\" is a multi-layered pancake that originated in the state of Kerala where the people referred to as \"mamaks\" (\"mamak\" means \"uncle\" in Tamil) hail from. The word \"mutabar\" is the original name for the particular dish referred to in other languages and dialects as \"murtabak.\" \"Mutabar\" is an amalgam of two words, \"muta\" (being the Keralite word for egg, a significant component of the dish) and \"bar,\" an abbreviated form of the word barota, or \"bratha roti\" (the bread). The bread base or pancake on which it is then spread over is referred to in Hindi as \"pratha roti\" or \"pratha.\" (Note the difference in pronunciations, pratha and brata).\nThere are similar versions of the bread in places such as Yemen and other regions of the Arabic world and Persia. All of these places in the Middle East were visited by Indian traders centuries ago and it would not be unusual for them to have learned from each other or to have adopted each other's culinary habits and practices. However, the word \"mutabar\" is the original name for the egg, chilli, and onion flavoured multi-layered pancake.\n\nIn countries where martabak is widely available, it is so common it has become an everyday dish. This dish is made not only at home, but often found in inexpensive food service menus specialising in traditional cuisine, which is why has the reputation of \"street food\", a local fast food sold by street vendors. Sometimes martabaki - especially sweet - go on sale in stores already in finished form.\n\nThere are many varieties of Martabak. For example, in Brunei, most martabaks are usually not stuffed, instead it is only made of dough (called \"martabak kosong\"), similar to Indian Paratha. \"Martabak kosong\" consists of a bread-like dough that is kneaded and prepared similarly to a pancake or other martabak by tossing it into the air, and served piping hot with a sweet curry sauce. In Singapore and Malaysia (where it is called Murtabak), the murtabaks are usually filled with spiced beef, chicken or mutton and served with a curry sauce, sweet pickled onions or cucumber in ketchup. Another variant in Malaysia and Singapore is murtabak cheese which uses mozzarella cheese as additional filling. Johorean (Malaysia) and Singaporean murtabak uses more minced meat than most Malaysian murtabak.\n\nThe common ingredients of Indonesian egg martabak, besides the dough, is seasoned ground meat (beef, chicken or mutton), sliced green onions, some herbs (optional), beaten eggs, salt, and potatoes. Some street vendors mix the ground beef with curry seasoning. In Indonesia, the common spices to make the seasoned ground meat are shallots, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, turmeric, some salt, and sometimes a little bit of monosodium glutamate. All the spices are ground or minced and stir-fried altogether. Some martabak makers add extra ingredients and other varieties to make their martabak unique, but they all share the same main dough. To fry martabak, the chef uses a very large flat frying pan or iron griddle. Usually they use vegetable oil to fry, but it is not uncommon to use ghee or butter too.\n\nBefore serving, martabak usually is cut into portions. Sometimes it is eaten with sweet and salty soy sauce and pepper. Savoury versions of martabak in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore usually is served with acar or pickled condiment consisting of diced cucumber, sliced carrot, shallots, and sliced chillies in sweetened vinegar. In Malaysia, Singapore and some areas in Sumatra, martabak is served with \"kari\" (curry) gravy. In Palembang, another variety of martabak is egg-martabak (eggs dropped into the flatten dough before folded while frying) served in curry (usually diced potatoes in beef curry) and topped with chillies in sweet-sour soy sauce called \"Martabak Haji Abdul Rozak\", or more commonly known as \"Martabak HAR\", made popular by an Indian Indonesian named Haji Abdul Rozak. There is also a popular martabak variant from Padang, West Sumatra called \"Martabak Kubang\", which is served with light curry as dipping sauce.\n\nAnother variety of martabak, especially in Malaysia and Sumatra (such as in Jambi, Palembang, and Lampung), is one called \"martabak kentang\" (potato-stuffed martabak). It usually uses the similar dough as other martabak, but it is stuffed with a mix of diced potatoes, beaten eggs, chopped green onions, and spices instead of beaten egg and ground beef. It is eaten by dipping it into hot sweet-sour soy sauce or curry sauce.\n\nAnother variety of martabak is called \"martabak manis\" (sweet martabak), also known by the name \"Terang Bulan\" or \"Martabak Bangka\". This naming however, is only valid in Indonesia, since the identical folded thick pancake is called \"apam balik\" instead in Malaysia.\n\nDespite sharing the same name, \"martabak\" (because they are both folded), the cooking method, dough (which uses yeast and baking soda), also the ingredients (usually vanilla extract is added as essence) are different from egg martabak, giving it a consistency more like a crumpet. While it is baked on a pan, the sweet martabak is spread with butter or margarine, sugar, crushed peanuts, chocolate sprinkles, cheese or other toppings. Before serving, the martabak is folded in half, so the toppings get in the middle of martabak. In Indonesia, egg martabak is also called \"Martabak Malabar\" to distinguish it from sweet martabak.\n\nThere are many new varieties of \"martabak manis\", including the addition of green tea powder (matcha), cream cheese, Oreo, chocolate candies such as Kit Kat and Nutella.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2118250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118250", "title": "Biblia pauperum", "text": "Biblia pauperum\n\nThe Biblia pauperum (\"Paupers' Bible\") was a tradition of picture Bibles beginning probably with Ansgar, and a common printed block-book in the later Middle Ages to visualize the typological correspondences between the Old and New Testaments. Unlike a simple \"illustrated Bible\", where the pictures are subordinated to the text, these Bibles placed the illustration in the centre, with only a brief text or sometimes no text at all. Words spoken by the figures in the miniatures could be written on scrolls coming out of their mouths. To this extent one might see parallels with modern cartoon strips.\n\nThe tradition is a further simplification of the \"Bible moralisée\" tradition, which was similar but with more text. Like these, the \"Biblia pauperum\" was usually in the local vernacular language, rather than Latin.\n\nOriginally Paupers' Bibles took the form of colourful hand-painted illuminated manuscripts on vellum, though in the fifteenth century printed examples with woodcuts took over. The \"Biblia pauperum\" was among the commonest works put out in block-book form, mainly in the Netherlands and Germany, where both text and images were done entirely in a single woodcut for each page. The first of many editions printed using movable type was printed in German, in Bamberg in about 1462 by Albrecht Pfister; there were about eighteen incunabulum editions. A \"Biblia pauperum\" was not intended to be bought by the poor — some manuscripts were opulent and very expensive, although the block-book versions were far cheaper, and probably affordable by parish priests. The simpler versions were however probably used by the clergy as a teaching aid for those who could not read, which included most of the population. The name \"Biblia pauperum\" was applied by German scholars in the 1930s.\n\nEach group of images in the \"Biblia pauperum\" is dedicated to one event from the Gospels, which is accompanied by two slightly smaller pictures of Old Testament events which prefigure the central one, according to belief of medieval theologians in typology; these parallels are explained in two blocks of text, and each of the three Biblical scenes is introduced with a Latin verse. Four Prophets hold scrolls with quotations from their Books, which prefigure the same event from the Gospels. \nFor example, the scene of Longinus spearing Jesus as he hangs on the Cross is accompanied by God bringing forth Eve from the side of Adam, and Moses striking the rock so that water flowed forth, together with prophecies of Zechariah, the Psalms, the Lamentations and Amos.\n\nThe earliest manuscripts of the \"Biblia Pauperum\" were made in Bavaria and Austria in the 14th century, they have 34–36 groups. Later versions add more scenes, and one of the most detailed versions is the 50-part blockbook version, produced in the Netherlands in 1480–1495\n\nThe \"Biblia\" was rivalled by the \"Speculum Humanae Salvationis\" (\"Mirror of Human Salvation\"), another very popular compilation of typological pairings, with rather more text than the \"Biblia\". The iconographical programmes of these books are shared with many other forms of medieval art, including stained glass windows and carvings of biblical subjects. Since books are more portable than these, they may well have been important in transmitting new developments in depicting the subjects. Most subjects, such as the Annunciation to the Shepherds, can be seen in a very similar form at different dates, in different media and different countries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2118965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2118965", "title": "Golowan Festival", "text": "Golowan Festival\n\nGolowan (sometimes also Goluan or Gol-Jowan) is the Cornish language word for the Midsummer celebrations in Cornwall, UK: widespread prior to the late 19th century and most popular in the Penwith area and in particular Penzance and Newlyn. The 2019 Golowan Festival dates are 21 June to 30 June 2019. The celebrations were centred on the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. The midsummer bonfire ceremonies (\"Tansys Golowan\" in Cornish) were revived at St Ives in 1929 by the Old Cornwall Society and since then spread to other societies across Cornwall, as far as Kit Hill near Callington. Since 1991 the Golowan festival in Penzance has revived many of these ancient customs and has grown to become a major arts and culture festival: its central event 'Mazey Day' now attracts tens of thousands of people to the Penzance area in late June.\n\nThe ancient festival was first described by Dr William Borlase in 1754 in his book \"Antiquities of Cornwall\".\nThe Penzance Golowan was one of the last examples of this practice in Cornwall until its prohibition by the Penzance Borough Council in the 1890s due to increased insurance premiums in the town and perceived fire risk. The celebrations themselves were centred on the lighting of fireworks, tar barrels, and torches on the evening of 23 June every year (St John's Eve). Towards the end of these festivities the local youths of the town would take part in the ancient serpent dance and jump or pass themselves through the dying embers of the flames. During these celebrations it was also usual to elect a Mock Mayor or Mayor of the Quay.\nIn 1864 it was recorded that the organising committee of the festival let off \"258 dozen fire crackers and numerous Roman Candles, Jack-in-box and sky rockets\" The day after these celebrations, a 'Midsummer's Day' fair took place on Penzance quay; boat rides and other entertainments were included in these celebrations.\n\nTwo descriptions of the fire festival in Victorian times follow below:\n\nPorthleven and Newlyn in particular being centres for much of the celebration of St Peter's-tide because of St Peter's role as the patron saint of fishermen. St Peter's-tide is still celebrated in Porthleven however in a far more muted fashion Porthleven Petertide. M. A. Courtney in her book \"Cornish Feasts and Feasten Customs\" describes a delay to the Newlyn festivities in 1883 when the majority of the Newlyn fishing fleet were at sea, returning to celebrate the fire festival many days after the actual event. Polperro is also believed to be the site of major St Peter's Eve celebrations. Mevagissey feast which occurs around St Peter's Eve continues to be celebrated.\n\nThe people of St Just in Penwith had their own particular practices, Lake's Parochial history of Cornwall (1868) states:\n\nThroughout Europe there are similar fire festivals held on the 23 and 24 June. St. John's Eve in Ireland, Jāņi in Latvia and Saint Jonas' Festival are but a few examples. Golowan is just one example of a much wider Midsummer European tradition.\nThe modern Golowan festival in Penzance started in 1991 as an attempt to revive many of the traditions stated above and has grown into one of the UK's most distinctive festivals. The core of the modern festival is 3 days known as Mazey Eve, Mazey Day and Quay Fair Day. Mazey Eve takes place around the harbour area of Penzance and includes a popular election of the 'Mayor of Quay' and a large firework display. The following day – Mazey Day is a large community and arts celebration. Artists, Schools and members of the public take part in a series of processions that include music, giant sculptures and variety of other artistic activities. Contributions from musicians and artists from the Celtic nations are a regular feature as are a variety of other musical contributions. Penzance itself during this day is decorated with large amounts of greenery – mirroring the practice in the town during the ancient festival. A large number of market stalls are also present throughout the town. Mazey Day attracts thousands of visitors to the area and has become an important symbol of the identity of town amongst local people. Quay Fair day is a celebration that is similar in many ways to 'Midsummer Fair' described in the ancient festival with the addition a popular street entertainment.\n\nIn October 2015 Penzance Town Council outsourced the running of the festival to a not-for-profit community interest company, which, having run the festival successfully from 2016 to 2018, has now been contracted to run the Festival till 2021.\".\n\nDuring the evening of Mazey Eve and on 23 June (St John's Eve) every year Penglaz the Penzance 'Obby 'Oss appears. Penglaz owes its origins to the descriptions of the hobby horse that once accompanied the Christmas guisers in their perambulation of Penzance during the nineteenth century. The classic, contemporary account of the guisers' horse was given by Richard Edmonds who described the horse as being:\n\nThe horse was a character associated with 'Old Penglaze' in the guisers' games of forfeiture, described by William Sandys:\n\nBarbara Spooner in her work on the Padstow 'Obby 'Oss further describes the 'Obby 'Oss associated with \"Old Penglaze\".\n\nHer description is of the 'mast' type of hobby horse, and Spooner followed Robert Morton Nance in expressing the view that 'the May day games and Morris Dances, with their own type of hobby-horse, which includes a rider, had been brought in from England too recently to have acquired Cornish names.’It became imperative amongst the Celtic Revivalists of the early twentieth century that the Tourney horse (with its rider) should be seen as English, or foreign, whereas the mast horses were to be understood as native, Celtic beasts, complete with Celtic names. In fact, as Edwin Cawte demonstrated in his study of British and European hobby horse practices, the mast type of horse developed during the eighteenth century and was particularly popular during the nineteenth, whereas the Tourney variety predated it by several centuries.\n\nIn his Cornish dictionary, Robert Morton Nance believed the character of Old Penglaze to be the horse and believed that Penglaze was a genuine Celtic noun for a hobby horse, something one of the above mentioned quotations contradicts. Moreover the writer of Bewnans Meriasek, the life of St. Meriasek (or Meriadoc) of Camborne, writing in Cornish, understood the hobby horse as feminine in gender, whereas Penglaze is masculine, potentially undermining its status as an example of Cornish language.\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of its linguistic origins and accuracy of naming, etc., the modern Golowan festival's Penglaz takes its appearance from the later quotations descriptions and resembles strongly the Mari Lwyd of Welsh tradition and was first introduced in 1992 at the second revived Golowan festival by Merv Davey Hon piper of Gorseth Kernow. The original horse now forming part of Cornish music group Pyba's Guise dance programme being renamed \"Penguise\". The current \"Oss\" being used for the first time in 1993 .\n\nThe ancient Golowan celebrations were also the inspiration for the Old Cornwall Societies' midsummer bonfire celebrations. The hilltop bonfires that form a chain are currently held at Kit Hill, St Breock beacon, Castle An Dinas, and Redruth.\n\n\n"}

It has won several prizes, notably at beer competitions in the United States, and is New Zealand's biggest export beer.\n\nIn 1957 the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Arnold Nordmeyer, threatened to cut international beer imports as part of his \"black budget\" and challenged New Zealand's brewers to \"come up with an international-style lager beer\". Lion (then New Zealand Breweries) produced a beer the following year named Steinecker, named after the company whose equipment the beer was made in. The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\n\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.\n\nIn 1991, another beer bearing the Steinlager name was introduced. Steinlager Blue was marketed using an advertising campaign featuring The Blues Brothers. The two different tasting beers were known as Steinlager Blue or Steinlager Green which related to the colour of the bottle or can it came in (although Steinlager Blue was sold in a brown bottle). Steinlager Blue was discontinued in the later 1990s, leaving just Steinlager Green which then dropped the green from the name. Note the only reason Steinlager Blue & Green tasted different was the bottle colour. Beers bottled in green or clear bottles degrade under UV light. Both Steinlager beers were brewed in the same vat.\n\nOn the first of June 2007 Steinlager Pure was released in the New Zealand market. Steinlager \"Pure\" and Steinlager \"Classic\" are now sold alongside each other, with Steinlager Pure positioning itself at the premium end of the beer market.

Steinlager is also the current presenting sponsor of the United States leg of the IRB Sevens World Series.\n\nSteinlager was involved in yacht racing with the maxi-ketch \"Steinlager 2\", which was skippered by Peter Blake, won all six legs of the 1989–90 Whitbread Round the World Race, and again in 1995 with Team New Zealand with their \"Black Magic\" boat, which won the Americas Cup by beating Dennis Conner's defending boat Stars & Stripes, also known as Young America, 5-nil in the finals' series.

A \"Helfer\" in the Nazi Party typically served as a junior assistant to a higher official. The rank was created at first to replace the older Nazi rank of \"Blockleiter\"; however, a massive expansion of Nazi Party ranks in 1938 assigned the old duties of a \"Blockleiter\" to a rank known as \"Arbeitsleiter\". The rank of \"Helfer\" then became an assistant position to such higher ranks.\n\nThe insignia for a \"Helfer\" consisted of a brown collar patch with an eagle and swastika, and one or two stripes on the lower portion of the collar tab. A single stripe denoted the rank of \"Helfer\" while two stripes denoted the higher position of \"Oberhelfer\". The rank of \"Helfer\" was also common in Nazi student groups, typically held by the leader of a local student cell who answered to a local Nazi Party leader.

{"id": "2138327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2138327", "title": "Odyssean Wicca", "text": "Odyssean Wicca\n\nOdyssean Wicca is a Wiccan tradition created in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the late 1970s. Its principal founders were Tamarra and Richard James. Most of its practitioners today live in Ontario, but it also has members in the United States. The tradition differs from other initiatory Wiccan traditions in its emphasis on preparation of its members for public priesthood.\n\nThe Odyssean tradition is strongly connected with the Wiccan Church of Canada, a public Wiccan church also founded by the Jameses.\n\nThe Odyssean Tradition of Wicca was founded by Richard and Tamara James in 1979, along with other members of their coven. The name of the tradition was inspired by Homer's \"Odyssey\", and is meant to emphasize a belief in life as a \"spiritual journey\".\n\nThe tradition grew out of the James' creation of the Wiccan Church of Canada, with which the tradition is still very closely associated. While the James’s and their coven members claimed to have had backgrounds in Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca, and Continental Wicca, these claims were never substantiated—the general consensus of the British Traditional Wiccan community in Ontario prior to 1987 was that these claims had no substance whatsoever. Regardless, those traditions were not ideally suited for the goal of creating a place for public Neopagan worship, nor did any of these reflect the ritual style that the coven (and, by extension, the church) were adopting—with the exception of Pagan Way (an Outer Court system created by Gardnerian initiates) that had a direct influence upon Wiccan Church of Canada liturgy. The Odyssean tradition is a British Traditional-like Eclectic tradition of Wicca—with a public Wiccan priesthood providing religious services for a Neopagan laity. In 1987, the James' purchased much of Gerald Gardner's collection back from Ripleys, this included Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical. It is after this purchase that the James' received valid initiations and elevations into the various traditions and lineages British Traditional Wicca .\n\nThe Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada reached their apex in 1992—at that time there were four temples (Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Kitchener-Waterloo) and three proto-temples in Brampton, Oshawa, and Montreal. Currently, the Wiccan Church of Canada has only two temples; the mother temple in Toronto, Ontario and a temple in Hamilton, Ontario . While the influence of the Wiccan Church of Canada has declined over the past decade, the indirect influence of the Odyssean tradition has grown. Because the WCC is a public Modern Pagan church, and because many members of the laity, many neophytes, and many initiates step away from the WCC to follow their path elsewhere. There are more former members of the WCC laity and more retired neophytes and initiates of the Odyssean tradition than there are active initiates. Many of these retired Odysseans have gone on to found their own covens and traditions that are based upon Odyssean practices. Many of the other Wiccan churches that exist in Canada, and to some extent the United States, have drawn upon Odyssean sources and retired Odysseans.\n\nPrior to 1987, an Odyssean initiate who had been elevated into the High Priesthood would be autonomous of both the tradition's founders and of the WCC. That meant that they could initiate and/or elevate their students up to the highest degree (3rd Degree) without requiring approval from the other High Priesthood of the tradition. For those initiated after 1987, these initiates would have to retain active status—they must perform a minimal level of religious services (public rituals and public classes) to one of the temples of the Wiccan Church of Canada—for them to even bring a student before the Odyssean Priesthood Council. The Odyssean Priesthood Council is open to all initiates who currently have active status and it is only after obtaining the approval of the Council that an initiate may initiate or elevate their student. If an initiate fails to perform the minimum amount of religious services to one of the Wiccan Church of Canada temples, their status will be downgraded to inactive. An Odyssean initiate who has been inactive for more than one year and one day can be reclassified by the High Priesthood of the tradition as retired. A retired Odyssean initiate can only return to active status with the permission of the High Priesthood of the tradition. Therefore, while the Odyssean tradition and the WCC were separate during the foundation years of the church, it has been the practice for the past twenty years that the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada are firmly linked one to the other.\n\nBeyond the emphasis on public ministry, the Odyssean tradition is characterized by the following: it is an Eclectic tradition in its origins that has a strong British Traditional Wicca style to its forms of organization and initiation; although it emulates British Traditional the tradition's approach to ritual is more flexible and may often be less structured than many British Traditional Wiccans would be comfortable with; the tradition rejects the concepts of Neopagan monism and Neopagan monotheism; the tradition does accept the base-line Wiccan concept of Neopagan duotheism but does encourage students and seekers alike to choose to affiliate with a particular Pagan pantheon and encourages the devotion to a deity (or group of deities) .\n\nThe Odyssean training system is remarked upon as being notably rigorous, which can be observed in the Wiccan Church of Canada weekly classes. These classes comprise the basic body of knowledge considered necessary by Odysseans, and can span upwards of 150 hours of class time or more. Completion of these classes (which includes the student completing the homework exercises assigned) is often considered a minimum requirement by Initiates before they accept a person as a new student.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Odyssean Wicca was inspired at least in part by the Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Continental, and Blue Star traditions.\n\nDespite the first part of its name, like all forms of Wicca, Odyssean Wicca has no connection to the modern religion of Hellenismos, which is based on the worship of the Greek Gods of antiquity.\n\nBlue Star Wicca does have a special relationship to the Odyssean tradition, as a \"sister\" or \"cousin\" tradition. The Dymond line of Alexandrian Wicca also has a unique relationship with the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada. Because the Odyssean tradition has been created from the known published material (circa 1979) of Gardnerian Wicca and Alexandrian Wicca a greater exposure to the ritual style of other Wiccan and Modern Pagan traditions is offered to Odyssean laity, neophytes, and initiates through the Wiccan Church of Canada .\n\nThere are currently two temples in Canada, one based in Toronto and the other in Hamilton. Within the United States, there is a Pagan temple in Connecticut, the Panthean Temple.\n\n\n----\n"}

It ultimately originated among Indian South Africans of Durban. A small version of the bunny chow that uses only a quarter loaf of bread is sometimes called, by black South Africans, a \"scambane\" or \"kota\" (\"quarter\"); it is a name that it shares with spatlo, a South African dish that evolved from the bunny chow.\n\nThe meal is still called \"Bunny chow\" or \"bunnychow\" in Afrikaans, being a loanword from English.\n\nThe bunny chow was created in Durban, home to a large community of people of Indian origin. The precise origins of the food are disputed, although its creation has been dated to the 1940s. It was also sold in Gwelo, Rhodesia (now Gweru) during World War II and is still sold in the nearby town of Kadoma, formerly known as Gatooma.\n\nStories of the origin of bunny chow date as far back as the migrant Indian workers' arrival in South Africa. One account suggests that said Indian laborers who came to work the sugar cane plantations of Kwazulu-Natal (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field; a hollowed-out loaf of bread was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries. Meat-based fillings came later. The use of a loaf of white bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread as well as its weak structure; thus the cheap loaf, widely available at local stores, would be an optimal substitute vessel for the curry.\n\nOne story claims that a South African restaurant run by Banias of the Indian caste first created the dish at a restaurant-café, called Kapitan's, on the corner of Victoria and Albert streets in Durban. Another tale opines that the origin of this handheld dish was due to Indian golf caddies not being allowed to publicly carry sharp cutlery like knives during apartheid. \"\" in South African English is simply slang for \"food\" as well as the verb \"to eat\".\n\nThe traditional Indian meal was roti and beans, but rotis tended to fall apart as a take-away item. To solve this, they hollowed the centre portion of a loaf of white bread and filled it with curry, then capped the filling with the portion that was carved out. The vegetarian version of the meal is sometimes known as a \"\"beans bunny\"\". An alternate, albeit unlikely etymology is derived from a mondegreen of \"\"bun\"\" and \"\"achar\"\" (Indian pickles), though the latter are not usually included in the dish (unless as an accoutrement).\n\nBunny chows are popular amongst Indians and other ethnic groups in the Durban area. Bunny chows are commonly filled with curries made using traditional recipes from Durban: mutton or lamb, chicken, bean and chips with curry gravy are popular fillings now, although the original bunny chow was vegetarian. Bunny chows are often served with a side portion of grated carrot, chilli and onion salad, commonly known as sambals. A key desirable characteristic of a bunny chow is seen when gravy from the curry fillings soaks into the walls of the bread. Sharing a single bunny chow is not uncommon.\n\nBunny chows come in quarter, half and full loaves. When ordering a bunny chow in Durban, the local slang dictates that you need only ask for a \"quarter mutton\" (or flavour and size of your choice). Bunny chows are mainly eaten using the fingers; it is unusual to see locals use utensils when eating this dish. Bunny chow is presented to customers wrapped in the previous day's newspapers.\n\nThese days bunny chows are available in many small take-aways and Indian restaurants throughout South Africa. The price ranges from for a quarter beans or dhal, to for a quarter mutton bunny, and generally one can multiply the price of a quarter by between 3 and 4 to attain the price of a full bunny.\n\nEach year, the \"Bunny Chow Barometer\" is held in September on the south bank of the Umgeni River, just above Blue Lagoon (a popular Sunday picnic spot for Durban Indians), attracting numerous entrants from across the Durban Metro region to compete for the title of top bunny maker.\n\n"}

{"id": "2146000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2146000", "title": "Thangata", "text": "Thangata\n\n\"Thangata\" is a word deriving from the Chewa language of Malawi which has changed its meaning several times, although all meanings relate to agriculture. Its original, pre-colonial usage related to reciprocal help given in neighbours' fields or freely-given agricultural labour as thanks for a benefit. In colonial times, between 1891 and 1962, it generally meant agricultural labour given without pay, by a tenant on an estate owned by a European, in lieu of a cash rent. Thangata was exploited, and tenants could be forced to work on the owners' crops for four to six months annually when they could have cultivated their own crops. From the 1920s, the name thangata was extended to situations where tenants were given seeds to grow set quotas of designated crops instead of providing cash or labour. Both forms of thangata were abolished in 1962, but both before and after independence and up to the present, the term has been used for short-term rural casual work, often on tobacco estates, which is considered by workers to be exploitative.\n\nThe term “thangata” has had several meanings in Malawi in the last 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use was very different from its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In the last two or three decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.\n\nThe 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, and local chiefs sought to gain European protection from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered was only a right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In the early years of the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a year at this time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to stay. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.\n\nThe Nyasaland High Court in 1903 exempted the original inhabitants of estates from thangata and gave them some security. Legislation allowing other tenants to pay rent rather than thangata, and for cash payment if they performed more than the required thangata was enacted in 1908, but not implemented. The harshness of thangata was at least one of the reasons underlying the 1915 uprising led by John Chilembwe. Following this revolt, a new attempt to abolish thangata in favour of cash rent was made, but it failed because of the political influence of the estate owners. The thangata system was a bar to progress and impoverished people by limiting the amount of time they could work for themselves. There was no place for crafts or skills in thangata: reduced all tenants to unskilled manual labour, and was likened to a form of serfdom. Even after Chilembwe’s revolt, the labour obligation on many estates was little modified, sometimes amounting to six months for thangata and rent. Although some abuses were curtailed, others such as equating a month of thangata to 30 days (or five weeks of six days’ work), and requiring the wives of absent migrant workers, widows and single women to work in breach of custom, persisted. However, by 1918 most cotton, and by 1925 most tobacco, was not grown on estates by direct labour, but by smallholders on Crown lands. As the demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners claimed that, as they had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations, they had become rent-free squatters.\n\nSome smaller estates failed, but others were saved from collapse by a scheme first adopted by one large owner, The British Central Africa Company Ltd. Instead using of direct labour, it issued seeds to tenants so they could grow cotton and tobacco under supervision, and sell their crops to the planters at low prices. This system was formalised in legislation, the 1928 Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, which modified thangata by allowing rents to be paid in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The true value of the crop, usually tobacco, given in lieu of rent greatly exceeded the cash rent. Estate landlords also benefited from restrictions on smallholders growing tobacco. Although the estates now largely acted as brokers for their tenants’ produce, and the name thangata, sometimes “tobacco thangata” after its commonest form was applied to rent in kind, the older form of labour thangata persisted on tea estates, and elsewhere if the owner wished to grow crops through direct labour.\n\nIt was estimated that about 9% of Malawi’s Africans lived on estates in 1911: in 1945, it was about 10%. In the latter year, the number of residents on estates was about 173,000 in 49,000 families. In the 1940s and early 1950s, there were tensions between estate owners and tenants over evictions and the tenants’ wish to sell produce of their choice in local markets, not through the owner. The expansion of tea-planting led to a shortage of African labour, which became acute after 1945. The British Central Africa Company Ltd had formerly relied on labour tenants for most of its workforce, but in 1946 its local Manager complained that it was unable to enforce unpopular thangata agreements or Sunday working although it threatened many tenants with eviction. There was a further crisis in 1952-3 when the British Central Africa Company tried to increase tenants’ rents substantially, against the advice of the Nyasaland government. A number of tenants resisted the increase, and the company issued eviction notices. The tenants' resistance included clearing land for cultivation on the undeveloped parts of the company's estates and refusing to pay taxes or attend courts. Riots broke out in Cholo in August 1953, leading to eleven dead and seventy-two injured. The tensions were lessened by government land purchases of former estates, so by 1962, the number of estate residents had been reduced to 9,000 families. In 1962, the 1928 Ordinance was replaced by a 1962 Africans on Private Estates Ordinance that granted tenants security of tenure and abolished all forms of thangata requiring labour or the production of designated crops, replacing them with cash rents.\n\nAlthough tenants produced tobacco on many estates, by 1935, 70% of the national tobacco crop was grown in the Central Region, at first by Africans on Crown land, later by sharecroppers under contract to the holders of leased land for one crop at a time, the “visiting tenant” system. The “visiting tenant” system had some similarities to estate tenancies in the Shire Highlands (called thangata, whether the rent was satisfied in labour or produce), but it was distinct as visiting tenants had permanent homes away from the places where they grew their crop. Like estate tenants, visiting tenants were underpaid for their crop because they were forced to sell it to the landowner. Although it was originally distinct from thangata, in 1963 shortly before independence, Hastings Banda, as Minister of Agriculture fiercely attacked the visiting tenant system and equated it to the hated thangata. Despite this rhetoric, when thangata was abolished in 1962, a temporary exemption was given for visiting tenants in the Central Region. However, this use represented a further extension of the term thangata.\n\nBy the late 1960s, politicians of the ruling Malawi Congress Party were involved in tobacco growing on the former European estates that the colonial government had bought, and which were sold or leased to the party elite after independence. Further elite-run estates were later created on previously communal lands. By 1990, there were 675,000 registered estate tenants with little security, and another 580,000 “squatters” lived on surplus land with no security, forming a pool of casual labour. Few tenants or squatters grew all their own food and most relied on casual paid labour or food-for-work arrangements on the estates to supplement what they could grow. The preferred term for short-term rural casual work paid for in cash or in kind (usually food) is ganyu. The term \"Ganyu\" is said to derive from the Portuguese \"ganho\" (sometimes spelled \"ganyao\") meaning something gained or a bonus. It originally denoted food or beer given as appreciation for neighbours when they worked on another’s fields, then the work a poor person did for food or cash for more prosperous neighbour. Today tobacco estates are the largest employers of ganyu workers. These may stay for the growing season like visiting tenants, or travel in daily. Larger estates may pay the minimum wage; smaller estates usually only give food. These arrangements are sometimes called thangata, as in the 2007 documentary “Thangata: social bondage and big tobacco in Malawi”.\n\nOf all the countries in Southern and Central Africa, Nyasaland was the most notorious for the duration of thangata and its importance to the colonial economy. Labour tenancy and sharecropping continued to exist in other less developed parts of Southern and Central Africa in the 20th century, but without the same social and political impact as in Nyasaland. In much of South Africa and Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, the growth of the money economy led rapidly to waged employment rather than labour in lieu of rent, and in North-Eastern Rhodesia estate agriculture was less dominant and land reasonably plentiful. In early Natal, the shortage of capital caused landowners to extract rent from African tenants in the forms of produce or labour, and this applied in Zululand until the early 20th century. However, in central Natal, employment for wages took over in the last third of the 19th century. African tenant farmers on European-owned estates in Matabeleland in the early colonial period could either pay rent or provide labour in lieu of rent, but after 1910, it was more usual to employ Africans for wages.\n\nThe system that is probably closest to thangata is the institution in Rwanda called ubureetwa. Although there were few European landowners, the traditional leaders who controlled access land were from the dominant Tutsi group. After the Europeans occupation, they were able to manipulate freely-given labour into an unpaid agricultural labour obligation. As Rwanda had a mobile population, chiefs could allocate land to clients outside the community that had a traditional claim to use the land, in clear parallel to the Mozambican migrants on Nyasaland estates. These incomers were prepared to agree to a heavy burden of labour for access to land.The colonial administration in Rwanda gave a legal status to ubureetwa and, up to the 1950s, resisted abolishing it or commuting it to cash.\n\nIn the Congo Free State, forced labour, amounting to virtual slavery, was widely used on public works and to compel Africans to gather ivory or wild rubber. Although forced labour in the Belgian Congo was abolished in theory in 1908, from 1917 a system of forced cultivation of cotton, coffee and rice was introduced for the peasant population, using their own land. On Belgian-owned estates,a Labour Code introduced in 1922 allowed employers to physically discipline their workers, so supposedly free labour was turned into a system of forced labour. However, neither the peasants nor estate workers were tenants, so the system was rather different from thangata.\n"}

The treats are often packaged in groups of five to represent happiness, health, longevity, wealth, and fertility. At Italian and Greek weddings, the almonds are placed in groups of five, an odd number that is indivisible to symbolize the unity of husband and wife. In the Middle East, Jordan almonds are considered an aphrodisiac so there are always plenty on hand for the newlyweds and their guests.\n\nJordan almonds are thought to originate in ancient Rome, where honey-covered almonds were introduced by a Roman baker and confectioner named Julius Dragatus. His confections were called dragati and were served by nobility at weddings and births. When sugar became more readily available in the 15th century, the nuts were coated in sugar instead. In Sulmona, Italy, the technique of creating the dragée almonds was perfected by the Pelino family.\n\nThe term \"Jordan\" is most likely a corrupted version of the French word \"jardin\", meaning \"garden\", hence, a cultivated rather than wild almond. However, others suggest the term referred to a variety of almonds originally grown along the Jordan River characterized by long, thin, slender, rather smooth kernels in thick, heavy shells.\n\nStill others believe that \"Jordan\" is a corruption of the name of the town of Verdun in the northeast of France. In the 13th century, when the medieval crusaders brought sugar to Europe after their campaigns in the Holy Land, it was very valuable and considered medicinal. During that time, an apothecary in Verdun began coating other medicines with sugar (calling them dragées) to make them easier to take. The town of Verdun became very well known for its \"dragées de Verdun\".\n\nOther chocolate dragées with multi-colored candy shells include the M&M's, initially designed to allow easy transport and consumption of chocolate for the U.S. military , have evolved into a popular candy, but are also sold as decorative dragées in 25 different colors.\n\nUsed to increase tolerability of bitter medication or merely to compel consumption, medicated candies or sugar coated pills can be referred to as dragées (e.g., Ayds was a popular weight loss candy in the 1980s).\n\nAnother form of dragée is a small sphere of sugar, in the Commonwealth often called cachous, used primarily in the decoration of cookies, cakes, and other forms of bakery. These are produced in various sizes, typically in diameter. This is larger than nonpareils and smaller than large pearl tapioca.\n\nSilver dragées have long been used for both wedding and holiday food decoration. More recently, metallic gold, copper, rainbow colors (red, green, blue, etc.), and pearlescent colors have become available.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the metallic-finish dragées to be inedible, and they are sold with a notice that they are for decorative purposes only. Early in the 20th century, the silver finish may have contained mercury (it no longer does). The sale of these dragées was banned for some time. Although the metallic-finish dragées can be purchased in 49 U.S. states, they are no longer sold in California due to a 2003 lawsuit against several sellers. However, in other countries (including the United Kingdom) they are classified as food items.\n\n\n"}

They are made with fish paste and boiled in a soupy broth, or deep fried. They are also common in Nordic countries.\n\nThere are two variants of fish balls, each differing in their textures, production method and primary regions they are produced in:\n\nIn the Faroe Islands, fish balls are called \"knettir\" and are made with ground fish and mutton fat.\n\nIn the Fuzhou area, \"Fuzhou fish balls\" (福州鱼丸) are made from fish with a minced pork filling. The variation from Fuqing is much larger.\n\nMilkfish Ball (虱目魚丸) is frequently found in Taiwan. The natural texture and aroma of the Milkfish give this variant a unique taste. This is one of the main ways Milkfishes' lesser-prized yet highly abundant white meat is consumed.\n\nFish balls with roe (魚包蛋) contain egg filling that are served at hot pot restaurants. It has sweet and salty taste with a popping element from the roe's texture. There is also a fried golden version.\n\nThere are three kinds of fishballs, known as 魚蛋 (literally \"fish eggs\"), sold in Hong Kong. They are yellow, white and golden.\n\nSmaller in size, made from cheaper fish than the white variety, they are usually sold at food stalls with five to seven balls on a bamboo skewer. The fish balls are usually boiled in a spicy curry sauce. Virtually every street stall creates its own recipe of curry satay sauce to differentiate them from other sellers. Fish balls are one of the city's most popular and representative \"street foods\" (街頭熟食).\n\nWhite fish balls are larger in size and made with white fish such as Spanish mackerel, pounded many times until the fish is a fine paste. Salt can be added, or egg whites and corn starch, but generally no other ingredients are added. The balls are then cooked by boiling. As a result of this cooking method, these fish balls are white in color. White fish balls should have an elastic (bouncy) and fluffy texture and a strong taste of fish. They are made using a more costly fish, and has a considerably different texture and taste. This kind is usually served to complement noodles at Cháozhōu-style noodle restaurants, and at some \"cha chaan tengs\", which also sell beef balls (牛丸) and cuttlefish balls (墨魚丸). Readily available in traditional markets and supermarkets, fish balls are also a popular ingredient for hot pot.\n\nWhite fish balls from traditional fish ball restaurants are made from fresh fish and are normally hand-made (手打) by the owners using traditional techniques.\n\nThe big golden fish ball is a snack in Cheung Chau. Distinguishing features include size, sauce and texture. They can be fist-sized and are served with a special curry sauce, and are mainly made from fresh fish which makes the texture more smooth.\n\nThe basic ingredients are fish, flour and flavourings such as salt and sugar, can also be used. The proportions depend on the quality and type to be made. The white fish balls found in some traditional Hong Kong restaurants are made using fresh fish; while street style are made using cheap fish and a mixture of flour to reduce costs. Flathead mullet (九棍魚/烏仔魚) and Daggertooth pike conger (門鱔) are common choices.\n\nOriginally, to reduce costs, they were likely made by mixing and frying the remaining materials of Chaozhou fish ball (潮州白魚丸) or stale fish. More recently, they began to be imported and nowadays, they are mainly imported by wholesalers and the texture is more consistent.\n\nIn Indonesia, fish balls are called \"bakso ikan\" (fish \"bakso\"). The most popular bakso are made of beef, but fish bakso is also available, served with tofu, vegetables and fish \"otak-otak\" in clear broth soup as \"tahu kok\". Bakso ikan has softer texture and lighter color compared to beef balls. Bakso ikan might be thinly sliced as additional ingredients in \"mie goreng\", \"kwetiau goreng\", \"nasi goreng\" and \"cap cai\". A similar dish made of fish surimi is called \"pempek\", however most of \"pempek\" are deep fried instead of boiled.\n\nFish balls, known as 鱼圆 (yú yuán) or 魚丸 (yú wán), are cooked in many ways in Malaysia and Singapore. They can be served with soup and noodles like the Chiuchow style or with \"yong tau foo\". They can also be served with noodles called \"mee pok\".\n\nFish balls are a popular street food in the Philippines, and considered a cultural delicacy. The most common type of Filipino fish balls are known as \"bola-bola\" (literally, \"ball-ball\"). They are somewhat flat in shape, most often made from cuttlefish or pollock, and served with a sweet and spicy sauce or with a thick, black, sweet and sour sauce.\n\nFish balls in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing wooden deep-frying carts. The balls are served skewered, offered with three kinds of dipping sauces: spicy (white/orange coloured) – vinegar, water, diced onions and garlic; sweet (brown gravy coloured) – corn starch, banana ketchup, sugar and salt; and sweet/sour (amber or deeper orange coloured) – the sweet variety with lots of small hot chilis added. Dark sauces are rare, as these are soy sauce-based and soy sauce is expensive for street food.\n\nA recent trend in the industry is the introduction of varieties: chicken, squid (cuttlefish actually), and \"kikiam\". The last are low cost renditions vaguely resembling the original Chinese delicacy of the same name.\n\nKnown as \"Fiskbullar\" in Sweden and \"fiskeboller\" in Norway, they usually come in metal cans or transparent plastic containers containing stock or brine.\n\nIn Norway, fish balls are a staple food commonly served with potatoes, carrots and/or cauliflower or broccoli in a white sauce.\nSauce is often made with the stock from the container, sometimes with \"karri\" (curry) as condiment, or mixed to create curry-sauce. \nAdditionally there is a pudding made with minced, ground fish and milk (\"fiskepudding\") or more luxuriously, with cream (\"fløtepudding\"), served with potatoes, carrots, steamed peas, and cauliflower, and sometimes shrimp.\nTiny fish balls called \"suppeboller\" (literally \"soup balls\") are also common in fish soup.\n\nIn Sweden, they are normally served with mashed potatoes or rice, boiled green peas and dill, caviar or seafood sauces.\n\nFish balls are very popular in Thai cuisine. They are usually fried or grilled as a snack. In Chinese-influenced restaurants, fish balls are cooked in noodle soups and come in many varieties. They can also be eaten in a Thai curry. \"Kaeng khiao wan luk chin pla\" is green curry with fish balls. One of the main fishes used in the production of fish balls in Thailand is \"Pla krai (Chitala ornata)\".\n"}

The term waterwolf is an example of “” , in which a non-living thing is given traits or characteristics of an animal (where a non-living thing given human traits or characteristics is personification). The traits of a wolf most commonly given to lakes include “something to be feared”, “quick and relentless”,” an enemy of man”.\n\nThe Netherlands, meaning “low countries” is a nation where 18% of the countries’ land is below sea level, and half of the land under one meter above sea level, and is prone to flooding. Before modern flood control, severe storms could cause flooding that could wipe out whole villages in the area of the waterwolf. Much of the land in the Netherlands is considered peat bogs. Peat is known to be an organic matter substance consisting of 10% carbon and 90% water and is usually found in colder climates where the plant growth and plant decay are slow. Peat is considered a carbon sequestration, and when dried can be burned as a fuel. Historically peat was the primary source of fuel in the Netherlands, and farmers would mine the peat to burn or sell, thus contributing to the erosion of the landscape.\n\nThe first great step to reclaiming land taken by the waterwolf was made with the creation of windmills that could pump water out of the surrounding area, allowing for the creation of polders, or areas inhabited below sea level with an artificially managed water table. Modern flood control in the Netherlands consists of maintaining polders, levees, and is highlighted by the world’s largest dam project: The Delta Works. While modern flood control has conquered the waterwolf, new events such as rising sea levels from climate change could once again bring the waterwolf.

The oldest known reference to a Thuringian sausage is located in the Thuringian State Archive in Rudolstadt in a transcript of a bill from an Arnstadt convent from the year 1404. The oldest known recipe dates from 1613 and is kept in the State Archive in Weimar, another is listed in the \"Thüringisch-Erfurtische Kochbuch\" from 1797 which also mentions a smoked variety.\n\nOnly finely minced pork, beef, or sometimes veal, is used in production. Most of the meat comes from the upper part from around the shoulder. In addition to salt and pepper, caraway, marjoram, and garlic are used. The specific spice mixtures can vary according to traditional recipes or regional tastes. At least 51% of the ingredients must come from the state of Thuringia. These ingredients are blended together and filled into a pig or sheep intestine. Thuringian sausages are distinguished from the dozens of unique types of German wursts by the distinctive spices (which includes marjoram) and their low fat content (25% as compared to up to 60% in other sausages).\n\nAccording to German minced meat law, the \"Hackfleischverordnung\", raw sausages must be sold on the day of their creation or until the closing of a late-night establishment. Previously grilled sausages have a shelf-life of 15 days, and sausages immediately frozen after their creation may be stored for 6 months.\n\nThe preferred preparation method for Thuringian sausage is roasted over charcoal or on a grill rubbed with bacon. The fire shouldn't be so hot that the skin breaks. However, some charring is desired. The sausages are sometimes sprinkled with beer during the grilling process.\n\nUsually, a Thuringian sausage is presented in a cut-open roll and served with mustard.\n\nFor the people of Thuringia, grilled Thuringian sausage is not merely the local cuisine. The grill is at the very core of Thuringian culture. Mostly beer instead of water is used to cool the grill, and the type of grill is a matter of doctrine. Mustard, preferably local, is the traditional condiment. Most commonly used is \"Born mustard\" from a local food company in Erfurt. In some regions (e.g. Sonneberg) the usage of any relish - even mustard - is a strict taboo.\n\nIn 2006, the \"Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum\", opened in Holzhausen, part of the Wachsenburggemeinde near Arnstadt, the first museum devoted exclusively to the Thuringian sausage.\n\nIn North America, the term \"Thuringer\" refers to Thuringer cervelat, a type of smoked semi-dry sausage similar to summer sausage. It is made from a medium grind of beef, blended with salt, cure ingredients, spices (usually including dry mustard), and a lactic acid starter culture. After stuffing into a fibrous casing, it is smoked and dried, then cooked.

The styles also vary across regions in Korean Peninsula. \"Mandu\" were long part of Korean royal court cuisine, but are now found in supermarkets, restaurants, and snack places such as \"pojangmacha\", \"bunsikjip\" throughout Korea.\n\nThe name is cognate with the names of similar types of meat-filled dumplings along the Silk Road in Central Asia, such as Uyghur \"manta\" (), Turkish ', Kazakh \"mänti\" (), Uzbek ', and Armenian \"mantʿi\" (). Chinese \"mántou\" (; ) is also considered a cognate, which used to mean meat-filled dumplings, but now refers to steamed buns without any filling. Japanese \"manjū\" () is another cognate, but it means a sweet, stuffed confection.\n\n\"Mandu\" can be divided into \"gyoja\" () type and \"poja\" () type. In Chinese, the categories of dumplings are called \"jiǎozi\" (; ) and \"bāozi\" () respectively, which are cognates with the Korean words. In Japanese, the former-type dumplings are called \"gyōza\" (), which is also a cognate. In Mongolian, the latter-type dumplings are called \"buuz\" (), which is also a cognate. \n\n\"Mandu\" are believed to have been first brought to Korea by Yuan Mongolians in the 14th century during the Goryeo Dynasty. The state religion of Goryeo was Buddhism, which discouraged consumption of meat. Mongolian incursion into Goryeo relaxed the religious prohibition against consuming meat, and \"mandu\" was among the newly imported dishes that included meat.\n\nAnother possibility is \"mandu\" came to Korea at a much earlier period from the Middle East through the Silk Road. Historians point out many cuisines based on wheat, such as dumplings and noodles originated from Mesopotamia and gradually spread from there. It also spread east along the Silk Road, leaving many versions of \"mandu\" throughout Central and East Asia.\n\nA Goryeo era folk song \"Ssanghwajeom\" tells a story of mandu shop (\"ssanghwa\" meaning \"dumplings\", and \"jeom\" meaning \"shop\") run by a foreigner, probably of Central Asian origin.\n\nIf the dumplings are grilled or fried, they are called \"gun-mandu\" (군만두); when steamed, \"jjin-mandu\" (찐만두); and when boiled, \"mul-mandu\" (물만두). In North Korea, mandu styles vary in different regions of the country.\n\n\"Manduguk\" is a variety of Korean soup (\"guk\") made with \"mandu\" in beef broth. In the Korean royal court, the dish was called \"byeongsi\" () while in Eumsik dimibang, a 17th-century cookbook, it was called \"\"seokryutang\"\" (석류탕).\n\nIn Korean cuisine, \"mandu\" generally denotes a type of filled dumpling similar to the Mongolian \"buuz\" and Turkish \"mantı\", and some variations are similar to the Chinese \"jiaozi\" and the Japanese \"gyoza\". \n\nThey are similar to \"pelmeni\" and \"pierogi\" in some Slavic cultures. \n\n\n\n"}

Okroshka is usually garnished with sour cream (smetana). Later versions that appeared in Soviet times use light or diluted kefir, whey, vinegar, mineral water instead of kvass.\n\nThe ingredients are diced and then mixed with kvass just before eating; the ratio of chopped food to kvass is similar to that of cereal to milk. This allows the vegetables to retain their texture. For that same reason, even though the ingredients are similar to those in a Russian salad, the taste of okroshka is quite different from that of the salad.\n\nOkroshka is mostly served in summer because the soup combines the refreshing taste of kvass and the lightness of a salad. Salt and sugar can be added according to taste.\n\nOkroshka is always served cold. Sometimes ice cubes are added to served portions to keep the soup cold in hot weather.\n\n\n\n"}

They served as changeable pieces of cloth that could themselves be laundered separately while keeping the wearer's doublet or gown from becoming soiled at the neckline. The stiffness of the garment forced upright posture, and their impracticality led them to become a symbol of wealth and status.\n\nRuffs were primarily made from linen cambric, stiffened with starch imported from the Low Countries. Later ruffs were also sometimes made entirely from lace. However, lace was expensive since it was a new fabric, developed in the early sixteenth century.\n\nThe size of the ruff increased as the century went on. \"Ten yards is enough for the ruffs of the neck and hand\" for a New Year's gift made by her ladies for Queen Elizabeth in 1565, but the discovery of starch allowed ruffs to be made wider without losing their shape. Later ruffs were separate garments that could be washed, starched, and set into elaborate figure-of-eight folds by the use of heated cone-shaped goffering irons. Ruffs were often coloured during starching, vegetable dyes were used to give the ruff a yellow, pink or mauve tint. A pale blue colour could also be obtained via the use of smalt, although Elizabeth I took against this colour and issued a Royal Prerogative: \n\nSetting and maintaining the structured and voluminous shape of the ruff could be extremely difficult due to changes in body heat or weather. For this reason, they could be worn only once before losing their shape. At their most extreme, ruffs were a foot or more wide; these \"cartwheel ruffs\" required a wire frame called a \"supportasse\" or \"underpropper\" to hold them at the fashionable angle. Ruffs could make it difficult to eat during mealtimes, similar to the cangue. By the start of the seventeenth century, ruffs were falling out of fashion in Western Europe, in favour of wing collars and falling bands. The fashion lingered longer in the Dutch Republic, where ruffs can be seen in portraits well into the seventeenth century, and farther east. It also stayed on as part of the ceremonial dress of city councillors (\"Senatoren\") in North German Hanseatic cities and of Lutheran clergy in those cities and in Denmark, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland.\n\nThe ruff was banned in Spain under Philip IV (orchestrated by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares).\n\nRuffs remain part of the formal attire of bishops and ministers in the Church of Denmark (including Greenland) and the Church of the Faroe Islands and are generally worn for services. The Church of Norway removed the ruff from its clergy uniform in 1980, although some conservative ministers, such as Børre Knudsen, continued to wear them. Ruffs are optional for trebles in Anglican church choirs. The judges of the Constitutional Court of Italy wear a robe with an elementar ruff in the neck. Underground artist Klaus Nomi used a ruff as part of his concert attire toward the end of his life, both to complement the Renaissance-era music he focused on during his late career, and to hide the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions on his neck. In the twentieth century, the ruff inspired the name of the Elizabethan collar for animals.\n\n\n\n"}

The coffee beans are roasted with palm oil margarine, and the resulting coffee is served with condensed milk.\n\nThe term ‘white coffee’ originates from the literal translation of its Chinese name, which was introduced in the 19th century by Chinese migrants who came to work in the local tin mines. The coffee beans themselves are not actually white; the colour comes from the milk stirred into the end product.\n\nIn Malaysia, the original white coffee started in the Old Town of Ipoh and was a drink made from beans roasted in margarine, ground, brewed, and served with sweetened condensed milk. This style of coffee continues to be popular throughout the country. However, “White Coffee” in Malaysia often simply refers to how the drink is prepared and presented - with added milk or creamer.\n\nOverseas visitors finding the margarine-roasted coffee beans unorthodox (due to their slight caramelized flavor) are often misled into believing that there is a type of coffee bean endemic to Malaysia called the \"white coffee bean\". The beans used are invariably imported beans roasted to a light color.\n\nLocal coffee manufacturers now mix instant coffee powder with non-dairy creamer or whitener and sugar, and market the 3-in-1 mixture as white coffee as well. The mixture is preferred by Malaysians at home or in the office as a convenient easy-to-prepare coffee drink. The advisability, however, of consuming instant coffee mixed with non-dairy creamer and sugar daily is slowly coming into question, with some manufacturers now taking the sugar out of the mixture, and marketing the 2-in-1 mixture as sugar-free white coffee.\n\nTraditionally, Malaysian style ‘black’ coffee roast (Kopi-O) is produced by roasting the beans with sugar, margarine and wheat.\n\n‘White’ coffee, on the other hand, is produced with only margarine and without any sugar, resulting in a less dark roast. Ipoh White Coffee is also widely available in an instant version. It is sometimes consumed after dinner.\n\nThe generic term ‘Ipoh white coffee’ in Chinese is \"旧街场白咖啡\"(Jyutping: Ji4bou2 Baak6 Kaa1fei1). Baak6 \"白\" (pinyin: bái), commonly meaning white, has nothing to do with the colour in this instance, but is rather a reference to the way the coffee is roasted. In Chinese, Bái also means ‘without’ or ‘unadulterated’, nothing has been added to the coffee during the roasting process.\n\n"}

Lechón is a popular food in the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, North Sulawesi province of Indonesia, other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America, and Spain. The dish features a whole roasted pig cooked over charcoal. Additionally, it is popular in the Philippines with Cebu being acknowledged by American chef Anthony Bourdain as having the best pig. It is also the national dish of Puerto Rico.\n\nIn most regions of the Philippines, lechón (also spelled \"litson\" or \"lichon\") is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, festivals, and the holidays. There are two major types of preparing lechon the Philippines, the \"Manila lechon\" (or \"Luzon lechon\"), and the \"Cebu lechon\" (or \"Visayas lechon\").\n\nVisayan lechon is prepared stuffed with herbs which usually include scallions, bay leaves, black peppercorn, garlic, salt, and distinctively \"tanglad\" (lemongrass) and/or leaves from native \"Citrus\" trees, among other spices. A variant among Hiligaynon people also stuffs the pig with \"batuan\" or \"binukaw\" (\"Garcinia binucao\"). It is usually cooked over charcoal made from coconut husks. Since it is already flavored with spices, it is served with minimal dipping sauces, like salt and vinegar or silimansi (soy sauce, calamansi, and labuyo chili).\n\nLuzon lechon on the other hand, is typically not stuffed with herbs. When it is, it is usually just salt and pepper. Instead, the distinctiveness of Manila lechon comes from the liver-based sauce, known as the \"lechon sauce\". Lechon sauce is made from vinegar, brown sugar, salt, pepper, mashed liver (or liver spread), breadcrumbs, garlic and onion. Manila lechon is also typically cooked over woodfire.\n\nMost lechon can either be cooked based on the two main versions, or mix techniques from both. Both variants also rub salt or spices unto the skin to make it crispier, as well as continually baste the lechon as it cooks. Sometimes carbonated drinks may also be used. They are cooked on a bamboo spit over charcoal for a few hours with constant (traditionally manual) turning. The pig is roasted on all sides for several hours until done. The process of cooking and basting usually results in making the pork skin crisp and is a distinctive feature of the dish.\n\nLeftover parts from the lechon, such as the head and feet, are usually cooked into another popular dish, \"lechon paksiw\". Like lechon itself, \"lechon paksiw\" also differs based on whether it is prepared Luzon-style or Visayas-style, with the former using liver sauce as an essential ingredient, while the latter does not.\n\n\n"}

Prince Genji was briefly attracted to her, until she lowered her fan to reveal her nose. However, he eventually felt sorry for her and helped support her.\n\nThe incident with the Safflower Princess's nose has always been a source of comic relief for readers of the \"Tale of Genji\". In the \"manga\" comics, the extremely shy princess is always depicted as being quite unattractive, the amorous prince having fallen in love first because of her voice and the way she plays the \"koto\". The arrangements of her \"jūnihitoe\" robes were, however, described as fitting those of an older lady. (She was hidden in the beginning behind the \"sudare\" screen, however, as part of the courtly Heian rituals, the 12-layered sleeves were allowed to peek from under the screen.

Kæstur hákarl has a strong ammonia-rich smell and fishy taste.\n\nKæstur hákarl is readily available in Icelandic stores and is eaten year-round, but is also served as part of a \"þorramatur\", a selection of traditional Icelandic food served at \"þorrablót\" in midwinter.\n\nKæstur hákarl contains a large amount of ammonia and has a strong smell, similar to many cleaning products. It is often served in cubes on toothpicks. Those new to it may gag involuntarily on the first attempt to eat it because of the high ammonia content. First-timers are sometimes advised to pinch their nose while taking the first bite, as the smell is much stronger than the taste. It is often eaten with a shot of the local spirit, a type of akvavit called brennivín. \n\nIt comes in two varieties; chewy and reddish \"glerhákarl\" (lit. \"glassy shark\") from the belly, and white and soft \"skyrhákarl\" (lit. \"skyr shark\") from the body.\n\nThe meat of the Greenland shark is poisonous when fresh, due to a high content of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but may be consumed after being processed. \n\nThe traditional method is by gutting and beheading a Greenland or sleeper shark and placing it in a shallow hole dug in gravelly sand, with the now cleaned cavity resting on a small mound of sand. The shark is then covered with sand and gravel, and stones are placed on top of the sand in order to press the shark. In this way the fluids are pressed out of the body. The shark ferments in this fashion for 6–12 weeks depending on the season. Following this curing period, the shark is then cut into strips and hung to dry for several months. During this drying period a brown crust will develop, which is removed prior to cutting the shark into small pieces and serving. \n\nIt is possible to witness the traditional preparation process at Bjarnarhöfn Shark Museum on Snæfellsnes.\n\nThe modern method is just to press the shark's meat in a large drained plastic container.\n\nThe late chef Anthony Bourdain described kæstur hákarl as \"the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing\" he has ever eaten.\n\nChef Gordon Ramsay challenged James May to sample three \"delicacies\" (Laotian snake whiskey, bull penis, and kæstur hákarl) on \"The F Word\"; after eating kæstur hákarl, Ramsay spat it out, but May was able to keep his down. May even offered to eat it again.\n\nOn season two's Iceland episode of Travel Channel's \"Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern\", Andrew Zimmern described the smell as reminding him of \"some of the most horrific things I've ever breathed in my life,\" but said it tasted much better than it smelled.

This Caribbean focus of Malibu's advertising stands in some contrast to the fact that the town after which it is named is in California rather than the Caribbean region.\n\nSince 2014, the advertising campaign has shifted toward the idea of Malibu encouraging people to have their \"best summer ever\" with a YouTube campaign and TV ads showing the difference between \"summer you vs rest of the year you\". In 2016 Malibu started an internet campaign with a commerce website and via #Malibu.\n\nThe original version of Malibu rum is flavored with coconut. There are many different versions of Malibu rum in the worldwide market, flavored with various tropical fruits such as banana, pineapple, passion fruit, island melon and mango. Additionally, there is a blend with mint, known as Malibu Fresh, tequila known as Malibu Red and a double strength version known as Malibu Black.\n\n\n"}

The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.\n\nIn Rome, where the elite (mainly patricians) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the Latinate form \"ephebus\" (plural \"ephebi\"), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.\n\nIn Ancient Greek sculpture, an ephebe is a sculptural type depicting a nude \"ephebos\" (Archaic examples of the type are also often known as the kouros type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form \"the \" Ephebe\"\", where is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the \"Agrigento Ephebe\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ragù was created by Alberto Alvisi in the 18th century. An Italian gastronomic society, Accademia Italiana della Cucina, documented several ragù recipes. The recipes' common characteristics are the presence of meat and the fact that all are sauces for pasta. The most typical are \"ragù alla bolognese\" (Bolognese sauce). Other types are \"ragù alla napoletana\" (Neapolitan ragù), and \"ragù alla Barese\" (sometimes made with horse meat).\n\nIn northern Italian regions, ragù typically uses minced, chopped or ground meat, cooked with sauteed vegetables in a liquid. The meats may include one or more of beef, chicken, pork, duck, goose, lamb, mutton, veal, or game, including their offal. The liquids can be broth, stock, water, wine, milk, cream or tomato, often in combination. If tomatoes are included, they are typically limited relative to the meat, making it a meat stew rather than a tomato sauce with added meat.\n\nIn southern Italian regions, especially Campania, ragù is often prepared from substantial quantities of large, whole cuts of beef and pork, and sometimes regional sausages, cooked with vegetables and tomatoes. After a long braise (or simmer), the meats are removed and may be served as a separate course without pasta. Examples of these dishes are \"ragù alla Napoletana\" (Neapolitan ragù) and \"carne al ragù\".\n\nEtymologically speaking, the term comes from the French \"ragoût\" and reached the region of Emilia-Romagna in the late 18th century, perhaps following Napoleon's 1796 invasion and occupation of those northern regions. Prior to that time, peninsula cuisine had a long history of meat stews going back to the Renaissance period. However, they were neither known as ragù nor is there any record of pairing them with pasta. Starting in the 16th century, it was not uncommon for pasta to be cooked in and served with a meat broth, often like a simple soup, from which the meat was removed and served separately, if eaten at all.\n\nThe first documented recipe for a meat sauce, in which the cooked meat was an integral part of the sauce served with pasta, dates from the end of the 18th century. The first ragù as a sauce, \"ragù per i maccheroni\", was prepared and recorded by Alberto Alvisi, the cook to the Cardinal of Imola (at the time \"maccheroni\" was a general term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe was replicated and published as \"Il Ragù del Cardinale\" (The Cardinal's Ragù).\n\nAfter the early 1830s, recipes for ragù appear frequently in cookbooks from the Emilia-Romagna region. By the late 19th century, the use of heavy meat sauces on pasta was common on feast days and Sundays only with the wealthier classes of the newly unified Italy, given the expense of meat.\n\nIndependent research by Kasper and De Vita indicates that, while ragù with pasta gained popularity through the 19th century, it was largely eaten by the wealthy. However, technological advances that came with the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century made pasta flour more affordable for the less affluent. The adoption of pasta by the common classes further expanded in the period of economic prosperity that followed World War II. According to De Vita, before World War II, 80% of the Italian rural population ate a diet based on plants; pasta was reserved for special feast days and was then often served in a legume soup.\n\n\n"}

The result is a water-soluble material that releases free iodine when in solution. Iodophors are prepared by mixing iodine with the solubilizing agent; heat can be used to speed up the reaction.\n\nDiluted iodophor is often used by brewers and winemakers to sanitize equipment and bottles. Its major advantage over other sanitizers is that when used in proper proportions, it does not require rinsing. However, it can leave unattractive orange-brown stains on plastic parts and equipment if left in contact with them.\n\nIt is often supplied in different concentrations and is further diluted with water before use. The label will advise the appropriate dilution ratio, commonly 1:1000 or 1:100. Equipment to be sanitized should be thoroughly clean and left in contact with the solution for at least 2 minutes.\n\nDiluted iodophor is used extensively in the dairy industry.\n\nIodophors are most effective in an acidic medium (pH 2 to pH 5) but are effective up to pH 7.\n\nIt is inactivated by proteins if the pH rises above 4 and is inactivated if the temperature rises above 50°C, as the iodine is driven off as a gas.\n\nThe optimum concentration is >200 mg/l free iodine with a contact time of 2 minutes and 100 mg/l free iodine for cleaned and dried equipment. In a nonfood-contact application the concentration may rise to 500 – 800 mg/l.\n\n\"Based on a review of the available toxicology data, the [US EPA] has concluded that iodine and iodophor complexes are of very low toxicity by the oral, dermal, and inhalation routes of exposure.\"\n\n"}

Gecekondu bölgesi is a neighborhood made of those gecekondular.\n\nIn Turkish, \"gece\" means \"at night\" and \"kondu\" means \"placed\" (from the verb \"konmak\", \"to settle\" or \"to be placed\"); thus the term \"gecekondu\" comes to mean \"placed (built) overnight\". And \"bölge\" means a \"zone\", \"district\" or even \"region\", so a \"gecekondu bölgesi\" is a \"suddenly built-up shanty-neighborhood.\"\n\nIn common usage, it refers to the low cost apartment buildings or houses that were constructed in a very short time by people migrating from rural areas to the outskirts of the large cities. Robert Neuwirth writes in his book \"Shadow Cities\" that these squatters are exploiting a legal loophole which states that if one starts building after dusk and moves into a completed house before dawn the next day without having been noticed by the authorities, then the next day the authorities are not permitted to tear the building down but instead must begin a legal proceeding in court (and thus it is more likely one can stay). Such buildings may be constructed without going through the necessary procedures required for construction, such as acquiring building permits, and can be very densely populated. Neuwirth stated in 2004 that \"half the residents of Istanbul - perhaps six million people - dwell in gecekondu homes\". Despite connotations of urban poverty and overcrowding, almost all gecekondu neighbourhoods are supplied with running water and electricity.\n\nThe gecekondu phenomenon is directly linked with the problems of unemployment and poverty in the rural areas of Turkey, especially in the east of the country. In many instances entire villages have migrated to the outskirts of the large industrialized cities in order to seek a better standard of living.\n\nAt present, some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds developed by the government's Housing Development Administration (TOKİ). Gecekondular are present both in small Turkish towns and in large cities such as Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul.\n\n\n"}

Fill-Ins are common in puzzle magazines along with word searches, cryptograms, and other logic puzzles. Some consider Fill-Ins to be an easier version of the crossword. Since the Fill-In requires no outside knowledge of specific subjects, one can solve the puzzle in another language.\n\nSolving a Fill-In usually requires trial-and-error. Many times, a first word is already given to help the solver start, but some difficult puzzles require the solver to begin from scratch without any help. Word entries are listed alphabetically by number of letters.\n\nThe solver is given a grid and a list of words. To solve the puzzle correctly, the solver must find a solution that fits all of the available words into the grid. Generally, these words are listed by number of letters, and further alphabetically. Many times, one word is filled in for the solver to help him or her begin the game.\n\nSolving a Fill-In typically amounts to searching for words of a certain length with letters in specific places. If a starter word is given in the grid, it is often useful to use it as the beginning search point. Raw \"trial and error\" is best used when there are only two or three words that can potentially fit at a given location; temporarily assume one of the words, and see if an impossible letter combination results. If so, that word is not the one that should go in the grid at that location. Smaller words may be easier to fit in the grid, but longer words give more clues to connecting words.\n\nCare must be given to marking out words that are not explicitly placed in the grid; this occurs when one fills in a vertical sequence of horizontal words, or vice versa. Forgetting to do this results in \"extra words\" and often makes the puzzle more difficult to solve.\n\nA common variation on the standard Fill-In is using numbers, instead of specific words, sometimes called\"cross numbers.\" In this puzzle, the entries could be listed as the number, a mathematical expression, or even an important year. \n\nA more complex variation on the Fill-In is the \"diagramless\" Fill-In, where the grid is initially empty. Another variation is having no words listed at all, but gathering them from a known group of words, such as the fifty American states.\n"}
{"id": "2193564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2193564", "title": "Agon", "text": "Agon\n\nAgon (Classical Greek ) is an ancient Greek term for a struggle or contest. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in tragedy by its fundamental characters, the protagonist and antagonist.\n\nIn one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the Olympic Games (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a mythological personification of the contests listed above. This god was represented in a statue at Olympia with \"halteres\" (dumbbells) () in his hands. This statue was a work of Dionysius, and dedicated by Micythus of Rhegium.\n\nAgon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with religious festivals. With a further religious meaning as used in 1 Timothy 6:12 in the New Testament and defined by Strong's Concordance as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).\n\nIn Ancient Greek drama, particularly Old Comedy (fifth century B.C.), agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the prot\"agonist\" and the ant\"agonist\" - in the highly structured Classical tragedies and dramas. The agon could also develop between an actor and the choir or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of Plato. The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns.\n\nIn 1948, Lincoln Kirstein posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as \"Agon\". After ten years of work before \"Agon\"'s premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer George Balanchine and composer Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine referred to this ballet as \"the most perfect work\" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.\n\nHarold Bloom in \"The Western Canon\" uses the term \"agon\" to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which \"the larger swallows the smaller\", such as in chapter 18, Joyce's agon with Shakespeare.\n\nIn \"Man, Play, and Games\" Roger Caillois uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.\n\nIn sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.\n\nWords derived from \"agon\" include agony, agonism, antagonism, and protagonist.\n\n"}

This cereal has cookie pieces that represent Chips Deluxe and are strikingly similar to Cookie Crisp. It also includes round O shapes that represent Keebler’s popular fudge stripe cookies.\n\nIntroduced in 1977, the first Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis, was a wizard in the Merlin mold, who with one wave of his wand, magically turned cereal bowls into cookie jars, usually chanting rhyming incantations along with it. He was voiced by Lennie Weinrib.\n\nIn 1985, Cookie Jarvis was replaced by the Cookie Crook, an anti-hero robber who attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp, and the Cookie Cop (also known as Officer Crumb), a police officer with an Irish accent who thwarts the Cookie Crook's attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp.\n\nA typical ad would begin with the Cookie Crook attempting to steal the cereal from a live-action breakfast table; often he and the Cookie Cop were portrayed as no larger than mice, so their pictures on the cereal bowl were “life size\". The Crook would have some new gadget or scheme to steal the cereal, but then the Cookie Cop would arrive and save the kid’s cereal in the nick of time. Eventually, the format of the ads changed to full animation, and the duo was portrayed as the size of normal humans; a more slapstick approach (similar to \"Looney Tunes\") was used in these commercials.\n\nIn 1990, the Cookie Crook was given a sidekick named Chip the Dog. Chip would howl the cereal's name (\"Coo-\"ooooooooooo\"kie Crisp!\") in each ad before he and his master were inevitably foiled by the Cookie Cop.\n\nAfter General Mills bought the Cookie Crisp trademark from Ralston in 1997, Chip continues to be the mascot with the Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop. In the format of the advertisements, Chip was a friendly pooch, no longer wearing a mask, who offered Cookie Crisp to a group of kids. Typically an adult would interfere on the grounds that cookies are not breakfast food. Near the end of the ads, the adults would change their minds once Chip gave them a taste of his Cookie Crisp.\n\nIn 2003, Cookie Crisp was introduced in Europe and Asia. The mascot in these countries is Chip the Wolf (originally known as The Howler), a wolf who fruitlessly attempts to steal Cookie Crisp from children much like how the Trix Rabbit would when it comes to Trix, and describes the cereal: \"It looks like chocolate chip cookies. Tastes like 'em too. But it's a breakfast cereal!\". He is voiced by Marc Silk.\n\nIn 2005, Chip the Wolf replaced Chip the Dog as the cereal's mascot in the United States.\n\n\n"}

Hasty pudding was used as a term for the latter by Hannah Glasse in \"The Art of Cookery\" (1747). \"Hasty-pudding\" is also mentioned in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of 1755 as a combination of either milk and flour or oatmeal and water.\n\nNorth American recipes include wheat, oat, and corn-based puddings.\n\nEliza Leslie, an influential American cookbook author of the early 19th century, includes a recipe for flour hasty pudding in her 1840 \"Directions for Cookery, In Its Various Branches\", and calls the corn type \"Indian mush.\" She calls an oatmeal version \"burgoo\". She stresses the need for slow cooking rather than haste, and also recommends the use of a special \"mush-stick\" for stirring to prevent lumps. (This mush-stick is perhaps related to the spurtle, or the \"pudding stick\" of the nursery rhyme beating.) \n\nA North American version, known as \"corn mush\" or \"Indian mush\", is in its simplest form corn meal cooked slowly in water until it thickens. Like grits or polenta, it may be eaten hot, or left to cool and solidify, when slices of the cold pudding may then be fried. This hasty pudding was once a popular American food because of its low cost, long shelf life, and versatility, and was eaten with both sweet and savory accompaniments, such as maple syrup, molasses, or salted meat.\n\nIndian pudding is a traditional New England dessert, \"a cold-weather classic.\" Seventeenth-century English colonists brought hasty pudding to North America and transformed it completely. Lacking wheat, they substituted cornmeal, a grain they learned to cultivate from the indigenous peoples, which led to the new name \"Indian pudding\", derived from their name for cornmeal, \"Indian meal\". They substituted milk, which was plentiful, for water and added locally available sweeteners, either molasses or maple syrup, and spices when available, typically cinnamon and ground ginger. Other traditional ingredients include butter and eggs for a smoother consistency and raisins and nuts for flavor and contrasting texture. Finally, Indian pudding is baked in a slow oven for several hours, transforming its texture from the porridge-like quality of hasty pudding to a smoother texture more typical of custard puddings. According to Kathleen Wall, Plimoth Plantation's expert on colonial cooking, \"The longer it cooks, the more liquid the gritty cornmeal absorbs, and the more it absorbs, the smoother the texture of your pudding.\" It was commonplace in the colonial era and enjoyed a revival as part of Thanksgiving Day celebrations in the late 19th century. It was found in most American cookbooks before 1900. The 20th century's commercial puddings with their industrially perfect smooth consistency displaced Indian pudding, and its cooking time had little appeal for the modern home cook. It is still associated with autumn holidays and occasionally revived by restaurants. It is usually served warm and sometimes accompanied by vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.\n\nHasty pudding is referred to in a verse of the early American song \"Yankee Doodle\":\n\nPolenta is the Italian version of hasty pudding, with maize/corn substituted for the wheat originally used by the Romans and mămăligă is the Romanian version, also made with maize. While Serbia also has a maize-made dish similar to \"polenta\" and \"mămăligă\", called kačamak (\"качамак\"), it also has a traditional hasty pudding dish made of fine wheat flour cooked with milk called \"mlečnjak\" (\"млечњак\"), as well as the standard grits cooked in milk called \"griz\" (\"гриз\"), introduced from the West in the 1890s.\n\nIn the recipe for the Brazilian pudding (), sweet corn grains are taken raw together with milk and most often coconut milk to a blender until uniformly liquid, then cooked until it becomes thick (shredded coconut might be added in the last minutes), with cinnamon powder sprinkled at the end.\n\n\n\n"}

In Poland it is grouped in the nalewka category of alcoholic beverages. Mass-produced versions of krupnik consist of 40–50% (80–100 proof) alcohol, but traditional versions will use 80–100% grain alcohol as the base. Honey, usually clover honey, is the main ingredient used to add sweetness, as well as up to 50 different herbs. There are many versions and some recipes have been passed down through generations; each producer typically uses their own recipe. Krupnik originated in the territories of present-day Belarus, which were at the time part of the larger Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Krupnik is sometimes heated before being served.\n\nLegend has it that the recipe was created by the Benedictine monks at a monastery in Niaśviž (then known as \"Nieśwież\") which was founded by Mikołaj Krzysztof \"Sierotka\" Radziwiłł. Known in Poland and Lithuania (including present-day Belarus) at least since the 16th century, it soon became popular among the szlachta of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. There are numerous recipes preserved up to present times in countless diaries of the szlachta. Krupnik was also used as a common medicinal disinfectant by Polish soldiers in World War II.\n\nAt times, spicy seasonings and herbs are added for flavour. The brand of the honey and the ratio of seasonings are key factors which determine the final taste of krupnik. A mixture of the honey and spices is diluted, boiled and strained before being added to a vodka base.\nIt may be served hot, at room temperature or chilled. A specific sort of krupnik which contains more herbs and less honey is brewed by Karaims.\n\n\"Krupnik\" is also the brand name of a range of alcoholic beverages produced by the Belvédère company, including krupnik, vodka, and various \"nalewki\". In 2014, Krupnik vodka was the eighth most popular vodka brand in the world by sales volume.\n\n"}

Traditionally Starka is made from natural (up to 2 distillations, no rectification) rye spirit and aged in oak barrels with small additions of linden-tree and apple-tree leaves. The methods of production are similar to those used in making whisky. Sold in various grades, the most notable difference between them is the length of the aging period, varying from 3 to over 50 years, and the natural colour which is obtained from the reaction between the alcohol and the oak barrel, not from the additives.\n\nStarka was known in Poland and Lithuania at least since the 15th century, later in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and by the 17th century became one of the favourite drinks of the nobility of the Commonwealth and Sarmatist culture. Tradition had it that at a child's birth, the father of the house poured large amounts of home-made spirits (approximately 75 proof) into an empty oak barrel, previously used to store wine (usually imported from Hungary at that time and hence called \"Węgrzyn\", or \"Hungarian\"). The barrel was then sealed with beeswax and buried, only to be dug out at the child's wedding. The name itself stems from this process of aging and in 15th century Polish meant both the vodka type and an old woman. Alternatively the name is derived from the Lithuanian word \"Starkus\", as production of Starka is associated with birth.\n\nIn late 19th century various companies (mostly in Imperial Russia and Austria-Hungary) slightly simplified the production process and adopted it to the needs of mass production by the Lwów-based Baczewski company. After the end of World War I, which put an end to foreign rule over former parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, starka remained one of the most popular spirits in both countries. After World War II when Lithuania was inside the Soviet Union, starka production there was not stopped and was produced in \"Vilniaus degtinė\" and \"Stumbras\" (Kaunas) factories. In Poland, all of the spirit producers were nationalized, but the production of starka continued, mostly as a high-priced export good.\n\nCurrently, Szczecińska Fabryka Wódek \"Starka\" (former \"Polmos Szczecin\") is the only company to produce Starka in Poland, and they offer it in all age classes, from 3 to 35 years old but the oldest Starkas date back to 1947. All Starkas produced by Szczecińska Fabryka Wódek \"Starka\" contain 40% alcohol by volume. There is also a number of other companies (most notably in Lithuania, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Russia, Latvia and United States) that produce vodkas styled after the starka (produced mostly from a mixture of rectified spirit and herbal tinctures).\n"}

The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.\n\nThis style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s, itself derived from the Neapolitan style pizza made in Italy. Today it is the dominant style eaten in the New York Metropolitan Area states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and variously popular throughout the United States. Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nThe first pizzeria in the United States of America was claimed to have been founded by Gennaro Lombardi in New York City's Little Italy in 1905, though this has recently been debunked by author Peter Regas. An immigrant \"pizzaiolo\" (pizza maker) from Naples, he opened a grocery store in 1897; eight years later, it was licensed to sell pizza by New York State. An employee, Antonio Totonno Pero, began making pizza, which sold for five cents a pie. Many people, however, could not afford a whole pie and instead would offer what they could in return for a corresponding sized slice, which was wrapped in paper tied with string. In 1924, Totonno left Lombardi's to open his own pizzeria on Coney Island, called Totonno's.\n\nThe original pizzerias in New York used coal-fired ovens and baked their pizza with the cheese on the bottom and sauce on top.\nBy 2010, over 400 pizza restaurants existed in New York City, with hundreds more of varied cuisine also offering the dish.\n\nNew York-style pizza is traditionally hand-tossed, consisting in its basic form of a light layer of tomato sauce sprinkled with dry, grated, full-fat mozzarella cheese; additional toppings are placed over the cheese. Pies are typically around 18 inches (45 cm) in diameter, and commonly cut into 8 slices. These large wide slices are often eaten as fast food while folded in half (like one would fold a cardboard box) from the crust, as their size and flexibility can make them unwieldy to eat flat. Folding the slice also collects the abundant oil in the crease, and allows the slice to be eaten with one hand.\n\nNew York-style pizza gets its distinguishing crust from the high-gluten bread flour with which it is made. Minerals present in New York City's tap water supply are also credited with giving the dough in metro area pies their characteristic texture and flavor. Some out-of-state pizza bakers even transport the water cross-country for the sake of authenticity.\n\nTypical condiments include dried oregano, dried red chili pepper flakes, dried basil, and grated Parmesan cheese.\n\nNew York-style pizza is most prevalent in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, but can be found throughout the Northeastern region and beyond. Outside this area, many pizzas described as \"New York style\", including those of major pizza chains such as Pizza Hut, generally do not fall within the variations commonly accepted as genuine in its native area.\n\n"}

While present nationwide, \"sinigang\" is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin, thus the versions found in the Visayas and Mindanao may differ in taste (mainly ginger is an additional ingredient). Fish sauce is a common condiment for the stew. The Malaysian dish \"singgang\" is derived from \"sinigang\".\n\n\"Sinigang\" is most often associated with tamarind in modern times, but it originally referred to any meat or seafood cooked in a sour and acidic broth, similar to but differentiated from \"paksiw\" (which uses vinegar). Other variations of the dish derive their sourness from native ingredients such as calamansi, \"kamias\", \"santol\", or unripe mangos. Guava, introduced to the Philippines via the Manila galleons is also used. Seasoning powder or bouillon cubes with a tamarind base are commercial alternatives to using natural fruits. \n\n\"Sinigang\" typically use meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with tamarind, tomatoes, garlic, and onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (\"gabi\"), white radish (\"labanós\"), water spinach (\"kangkóng\"), yardlong beans (\"sitaw\") and eggplant (\"talóng\").

Another variation includes adding locally made miso.\n\n\"Sinampalukang manók\" or \"sinampalukan\" (from \"sampalok\") is technically not a variation of sinigang, as the chicken has to be sautéed in ginger first instead of all the ingredients being placed simultaneously into the pot and brought to a boil. \"Sinampalukan\" is also distinguished by its use of shredded tamarind leaves, and is usually made together with ginger, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and spinach.\n\n\n\n"}

It was touted as an artificially flavored hybrid energy drink. Coca-Cola was marketing Vault as a combination with the slogan \"Drinks like a soda, kicks like an energy drink,\" as well as \"The Taste. The Quench. The Kick.\" \"Get it done, and then some,\" \"Chug & Charge,\" and \"Get to it!\"\n\nVault was a citrus-flavored beverage containing many of the same ingredients as the Coca-Cola beverage Surge. It was discontinued in 2011 in favor of a reintroduced Mello Yello.\n\nAlso, Coca-Cola bought controlling interest into an established energy drink called Monster Energy. Due to the high cost of the acquisition, continuing to sell Vault would have taken sales away from a brand that they had more money invested in.\n\nTest-marketing occurred in a limited area from June 2005 through Labor Day 2005. During this time, the drink was only available in certain markets in Alabama, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia. Vault was released nationally in February 2006 following commercials that were shown during the pregame show for Super Bowl XL.\n\nCoca-Cola representatives and the American Beverage Association stated that Vault contained 47 mg of caffeine per 237 ml (8 fl. oz.) serving, or 70.5 mg per 355 ml (12 fl. oz.) can, and 117.5 mg per 20 fl. oz. PET bottle. This caffeine amount was substantially higher than Surge's 52.5 mg per 12 fl. oz., Mountain Dew's 54 mg per 12 fl. oz., Mello Yello's 51 mg per 12 fl. oz., or Sun Drop's 63 mg per 12 fl. oz.\n\nThere were several varieties of Vault, the two most common being Vault and Vault Zero.\n\nVault was available in 16.9 fl oz, 20 fl oz, and 24 fl oz. PET bottles, 6-, 12- and 18-, and 24-pack cans, 1- and 2-liter bottles, and 16 oz extended cans.\n\nIn September 2005, The Coca-Cola Company released Vault Zero, a diet version of the citrus soda. Grape Vault and Peach Vault were two variants available only from Coca-Cola Freestyle machines.\n\nTelevision commercials for Vault featured men performing extraordinary tasks while drinking Vault, in line with the slogan, \"Vault. Get to it!\" One such commercial featured a man building a robotic scarecrow with laser eyes that rids his farm of crows, foxes, rabbits, and hippies. Other commercials included a man converting his and his neighbors' backyards into a football field using explosives and a chainsaw; a man renovating his house into a giant birdcage; a man who blows up a reef bed to obtain a large amount of pearls in order to win his girlfriend back from a Fabioesque man, and a man excelling at paintball, at one point using a squirrel as an improvised weapon. \n\n\"Vault Red Blitz\", a new Vault flavor, was released in late-February 2007 to compete with PepsiCo's Code Red, along with promotional pricing in select areas. Until its release, Coca-Cola had only released Mello Yello Cherry in limited markets as a competitor to Code Red, which has been available since 2001. Vault Red Blitz is berry-flavored, red, and also features the herbal supplement guarana.\nIn 2006, Vault Zero was reformulated in response to a lawsuit over allegations that ingredients in Fanta Pineapple and Vault Zero had the potential in certain circumstances to combine to form benzene, a carcinogenic compound.\n\n"}

This geographically limited pizza style has been favorably referenced by national critics.\n\nIn a New Haven-style pizzeria, a \"plain\" pizza is crust, oregano, and tomato sauce with a little bit of grated pecorino romano cheese sprinkled on and does not include Mozzarella. A \"plain\" New Haven style pizza may also be called a \"tomato pie\". Mozzarella is considered to be a topping; a customer who wants it must ask for it.\n\nPepe invented the \"white clam pie.\" Pepe's restaurant served littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar, which he later added to the pizza. The white clam pie is crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams.\n\nWhat makes New Haven style pizza distinct is its thin, oblong crust, characteristic charring, chewy texture, and limited use of melting cheeses. It tends to be drier and thinner than, but closely related to, traditional New York style pizza.

{"id": "2220268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2220268", "title": "California-style pizza", "text": "California-style pizza\n\nCalifornia-style pizza (also known as California pizza or Gourmet pizza) is a style of single-serving pizza that combines New York and Italian thin crust with toppings from the California cuisine cooking style. Its invention is generally attributed to chef Ed LaDou, and Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. Wolfgang Puck, after meeting LaDou, popularized the style of pizza in the rest of the country. It is served in a number of California Cuisine restaurants. Such restaurant chains as California Pizza Kitchen, Extreme Pizza, and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza are three major pizza franchises associated with California-style pizza.\n\nCalifornia-style pizza was invented more or less simultaneously in 1980 by Ed LaDou (the \"Prince of Pizza\"), then working as pizza chef for Spectrum Foods' Prego Restaurant in San Francisco's Cow Hollow neighborhood, and by pizza chefs working for Alice Waters at the Chez Panisse cafe in Berkeley, California.\n\nLaDou had learned pizza-making in the 1970s as a teenager at Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too, a traditional New York-style pizzeria in Mountain View, California. He made pizzas briefly at Ecco, an upscale restaurant at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto, California, before starting at Prego. Although Prego specialized in classic, Italian-style thin crust pizzas, its chefs encouraged LaDou to experiment with prosciutto, goat cheese, and truffles in their wood-burning oven, and send his results to guests. At one table, to whom he served an off-menu invention involving mustard, ricotta, pâté and red pepper turned out to be chef Wolfgang Puck.\n\nBy 1980, Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and its head chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a combination of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven when it opened in 1935. After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. Although prepared in classic fashion, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. Her cafe, and its pizzas in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics.\n\nWolfgang Puck, in 1980 and 1981, was preparing to open the restaurant that would make him famous, Spago, in West Hollywood, California. Initially conceived as a pizzeria, Spago's was modeled after the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. He was so impressed with the pizza LaDou had made for him at Prego, he hired LaDou as head pizza chef. Under Puck's guidance, LaDou developed more than 250 pizza concepts using ingredients such as scallops, roe, and baby zucchini flowers. Among their most famous invention was \"Jewish pizza\", a pizza dough first cooked then topped with smoked salmon, crème fraîche, capers, and dill. Another innovation was using infused olive oil, baby vegetables, chili oil, and flavored dough.\n\nIn 1985 LaDou helped two inexperienced lawyer-restaurateurs, Richard L. Rosenfeld and Larry S. Flax, start a new restaurant concept, California Pizza Kitchen (also known as \"CPK\"). He brought them many of Spago's recipes, which he had carefully saved. The new restaurant borrowed the concept of open kitchens centered around wood-burning pizza ovens from Spago, but instead of exotic gourmet ingredients it used innovative but simpler comfort food toppings. When the new restaurant's chef quit less than a month before opening, LaDou quickly designed and cooked an entire menu, inventing the now-ubiquitous barbecue chicken pizza on the spot. LaDou also helped develop pizza menus for Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and the Hard Rock Cafe.\n\nBoth Wolfgang Puck and California Pizza Kitchen were instrumental in turning California-style pizza from a gourmet food trend to a mass consumer food product. Based on the success of his pizzas and his status as a celebrity chef, Puck opened a series of restaurants, ranging from high end clones of Spago, to convenience chains for airports and mall food courts. California Pizza Kitchen grew to 200 outlets. Both introduced frozen pizzas, but after an early success Puck's supermarket lines were overtaken by CPK's, which are backed by Kraft foods.\n"}

The corresponding aniline or aryl amide reaction is sometimes called Goldberg reaction, named after Irma Goldberg.\n\nAn example is the synthesis of \"p-nitrophenyl phenyl ether\" \n\nAn active copper powder that is required for this reaction can be prepared by the reduction of copper sulfate by zinc metal in hot water causing the precipitation of elemental copper.\n\nThe reaction often requires high-boiling polar solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone, nitrobenzene or dimethylformamide and high temperatures (often in excess of 210 °C) with stoichiometric amounts of copper. The aryl halide is activated by electron-withdrawing groups or carries a carboxylic acid group in the aromatic ortho position. The research field was revitalized with the introduction of catalytic copper reactions in 2001–2003 using up to 0.1 equivalent copper iodide, base and a diamine ligand.\n\nAn example of a Goldberg reaction is the synthesis of fenamic acid, an intermediate of acridone via the Goldberg reaction:\n\nAn Ullmann-type aromatic amination reaction between an aryl iodide and an aryl amine as coupling partners has been published. The catalyst used is formed from copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline.

Mexicans refer to them as burritos, and they come in different ingredient varieties, primarily wheat flour or corn, typically filled with meat, beans, rice, cheese, and other ingredients.\n\nThe wrap in its Western form probably comes from California, as a generalization of the Tex-Mex burrito, and became popular in the 1990s. It may have been invented and named at a southern California chain called \"I Love Juicy\" in the early 1980s.

Moreover, Valentine's own story dates his use of the \"name\" 'wrap' to the mid-1990s, after it is documented in California. San Francisco-based chain World Wrapps, which opened its first location in February 1995, is credited with popularizing the wrap nationwide.\n\nRestaurants such as Camille's Sidewalk Cafe, Sonic Drive-In, Jason's Deli, Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Roly Poly and McAlister's Deli serve wraps. KFC now serves its chicken in a wrap as menu choice, with lettuce, mayonnaise and salsa. McDonald's has a snack wrap, with a fried, or grilled chicken strip, lettuce, Cheddar, and ranch dressing. Smokey Bones Barbeque and Grill has recently introduced a Portobello Chicken Wrap to broaden their selection of grilled menu items.

It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually served with a savory curry or \"bhaji\", as in Puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes.\n\nPuris are most commonly served at breakfast. It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian food offered in prayer as prasadam. It's similar to Gnocco fritto fried bread from Modena, Italy.\n\nThe name \"puri\" derives from the Sanskrit word पूरिका (pūrikā), from पुर (pura) \"filled\". It has a similar name in many Asian languages including: Gujarati: પૂરી, (\"puri\"), (\"Purī\"), (\"pūḍī\"), (\"pūrī\"), (\"pūri\"), , (\"pūrī\"), (\"puri\"), (\"puri\"), (\"pūḍī\"), (\"pūri\"), (\"pūri\"), (\"puri\")\n\nPuris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour), sooji (coarse wheat flour) or, most commonly, maida (refined wheat flour). In some recipes, ajwain or cumin seed is added to the dough. The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil. While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions. When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri). Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri. A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks.\n\nPuri can be eaten with many savory accompaniments, including korma, chana masala, dal, potato-based curries (for example, \"saagu\", \"bhaji\", \"bhujia\", \"Aloo ki tarkari\", \"shaak\", and \"sambharo\"), shrikhand and basundi. In some parts of India, puri is also served with a mixed vegetable dish that is prepared during Puja. Puri is also eaten with sweet accompaniments, such as kheer (a dessert prepared with rice, milk and sugar) or halwa (in Hindi-speaking regions of India, the expression \"Halwa puri khana\", \"to eat puri with halwa\", signifies a celebration – of possibly modest means). Puri is often the bread of choice for festivals and special occasions.\n\nIn the South of India, puri is almost always made for tiffin, and on the east coast (Andhra, Tamil Nadu) it's rarely eaten with non-vegetarian dishes. Often, they will be served with pickles, chutneys, dal masalas, potato masala, or gourd curry (either ivy, ridge, or bottle varieties).\n\nA variant of puri is bhatoora, which is three times the size of a puri and served with chholey (spicy chick peas). It often constitutes a full meal. (See chole bhature). Bhatoora is made of a different flour; puri uses whole-wheat flour while bhatura uses leavened all-purpose flour (maida).\n\nIn the Indian state of Odisha a large size puri is made during Bali Yatra which is called \"thunka puri\" ().\n\nAnother variant, largely popular in the Northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is \"bedvi\". It is a saltier and stiffer version of the regular puri, and is often stuffed with lentils.\n\nAnother variant of the puri popular in the eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha is the luchi. In Assam, it is pronounced as \"lusi\". Luchis in Bengal are served with typical side dishes like aloor dum (potato preparation), begun bhaja (fried brinjal) and others\n\nThe \"puris\" used for \"panipuri\" are smaller, and are usually made crisper by the addition of \"rava/sooji\" (semolina) to the dough.\n\nSev puri is an Indian snack offered by street vendors who serve chaat.\n\nStreet vendors in Mumbai serve bhel in a throw-away folded leaf with a flat puri to scoop it.\n\nA new variant of this traditional snack or breakfast is the Pumpkin Poori. The delicious lightweight pumpkin pooris are best served with spicy tomato chutney. This dish includes ingredients for poori pumpkin paste, wheat flour, gram four, salt, carom seeds and oil etc. This is the easy breakfast food.\n\n"}

{"id": "2228163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228163", "title": "Syphon recorder", "text": "Syphon recorder\n\nThe syphon or siphon recorder is an obsolete electromechanical device used as a receiver for submarine telegraph cables invented by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in 1867. It automatically records an incoming telegraph message as a wiggling ink line on a roll of paper tape. Later a trained telegrapher would read the tape, translating the pulses representing the \"dots\" and \"dashes\" of the Morse code to characters of the text message.\n\nThe syphon recorder replaced Thomson’s mirror galvanometer as the standard receiving instrument for submarine telegraph cables, allowing long cables to be worked using just a few volts at the sending end. The disadvantage of the mirror galvanometer was that it required two operators, one with a steady eye to read and call off the signal, the other to write down the characters received. Its use spread to ordinary telegraph lines and radiotelegraphy radio receivers. A major advantage of the syphon recorder was that no operator has to monitor the line constantly waiting for messages to come in. The paper tape preserved a record of the actual message before translation to text, so errors in translation could be checked.\n\nThe siphon recorder works on the principle of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink.\n\nThe current from the telegraph line is applied to the coil. The pulses of current representing the Morse code \"dots\" and \"dashes\" flowing through the coil create a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, creating a torque which causes the coil to rotate slightly about its vertical suspension axis. The wire linkages cause the siphon support plate to rotate about its horizontal axis, swinging the siphon tube across the paper tape. This draws a displacement in the ink line on the tape as long as the current is present in the coil. Thus the ink line on the tape forms a graph of the current in the telegraph line, with displacements representing the \"dots\" and \"dashes\" of the Morse code. An operator knowing Morse code later translates the line on the tape to characters of the text message, and types them onto a telegram form.\n\nThe siphon and an ink reservoir are together supported by an ebonite bracket, separate from the rest of the instrument, and insulated from it. This separation permits the ink to be electrified to a high potential while the body of the instrument, including the paper and metal writing tablet, are grounded, and at low potential. The tendency of a charged body is to move from a place of higher to a place of lower potential, and consequently the ink tends to flow downwards to the writing tablet. The only avenue of escape for it is by the fine glass siphon, and through this it rushes accordingly and discharges itself upon the paper. The natural repulsion between its like-electrified particles causes the shower to issue in spray. As the paper moves over the pulleys a delicate hair line is marked, straight when the syphon is stationary, but curved when the siphon is pulled from side to side by the oscillations of the signal coil.\n\nPower to pull the roll of paper tape through the syphon recorder was usually supplied by one Froment's mouse mill motors. These also drove an electrostatic machine to generate the electricity to power the syphon.\n\nA simpler mechanism was developed by Alexander Muirhead. This used a vibrating pen to avoid the same problem of the ink sticking to the paper. The recording pen was suspended on a thin wire, vibrated by an electromagnet mechanism similar to that of an electric bell, to break contact with the paper.\n"}

It refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide low-cost public housing.\n\nApartments in the building can be rented from the respective municipality.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" have become an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s. Up to 1918, the housing conditions of Vienna's growing working class were appalling by modern standards. When the Social Democratic Party of Austria gained control of the municipal administration during Austria's First Republic (1918-1934) (so called \"Red Vienna\"), it began the project of improving living conditions for workers. A large number of Gemeindebauten, usually large residential estates, were built during that time. Including those buildings that were finished after the events of February 1934, 64,000 apartments where completed, which created housing space for about 220,000 people. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.\n\nThe classic interwar Gemeindebauten typically have a main entrance with a large gate, through which one enters into a yard. Inside, there are trees and some greenery, where children can play without having to go out on the street. Apartments are accessed from the inside.\n\nThis fortress-like structure made the buildings adaptable to military use. Several Gemeindebauten in Vienna, most notably the Karl-Marx-Hof, were sites of fighting during the Austrian Civil War of February 1934, when they were defended as Social Democratic Party strongholds.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" continued to be built after 1945, but the style of architecture changed over the decades. During the 1960s and 1970s, the municipality began to build extensive residential blocks consisting of high-rise buildings such as Großfeldsiedlung.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" in Vienna can be recognized by the following text (or similar) which can usually be found in large red letters above the main entrance:\n\n\"Wohnhausanlage der Gemeinde Wien errichtet in den Jahren 1925 bis 1927 aus den Mitteln der Wohnbausteuer\"\n<br>(Residential estate of the Municipality of Vienna built from 1925 to 1927 financed from the revenues of the Residential Construction Tax).\n\nLarger \"Gemeindebauten\" are identified by their name. The names sometimes derive from the building's geographic location, but usually they are named after a person, sometimes after a famous freedom fighter (e.g., George Washington), but much more often after a famous socialist (e.g., Olof Palme) or a Viennese Social Democratic Party functionary.\n\nToday, about 600,000 people (not necessarily poor ones), about a third of the population of Vienna, live in apartments owned by the city. As the Social Democratic Party has been firmly in control of the municipal administration since World War II, opposition politicians sometimes claim that party members are more likely to be assigned an apartment.\n\nThe most famous \"Gemeindebau\" in Vienna is the Karl-Marx-Hof, built between 1927-33.

A team of CDER physicians, statisticians, chemists, pharmacologists, and other scientists reviews the company's data and proposed labeling. If this independent and unbiased review establishes that a drug's health benefits outweigh its known risks, the drug is approved for sale. The center doesn't actually test drugs itself, although it does conduct limited research in the areas of drug quality, safety, and effectiveness standards.\n\nIn the European Union, it is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that evaluates medicinal products.\n\nOn average, only one in every 5,000 compounds that makes it through lead development to the stage of pre-clinical development becomes an approved drug. Only 10% of all drugs started in human clinical trials become an approved drug.\n\n\n"}

Turnovers can be sweet or savory and are often made as a sort of portable meal or dessert, similar to a sandwich. They are often eaten for breakfast.\n\nIt is common for sweet turnovers to have a fruit filling and be made with a puff pastry or shortcrust pastry dough; savory turnovers generally contain meat and/or vegetables and can be made with any sort of dough, though a kneaded yeast dough seems to be the most common in Western cuisines. They are usually baked, but may be fried.\n\nSavory turnovers are often sold as convenience foods in supermarkets. Savory turnovers with meat or poultry and identified as a turnover in the United States (for example, \"Beef Turnover\" or \"Cheesy Chicken Turnover\") have to meet a standard of identity or composition and should contain a certain amount of meat or poultry. \n\nIn Ireland, a \"turnover\" is a particular type of white bread, commonly found in Dublin.\n\nCommon turnover fillings include fruits such as apples, blueberries and cherries, meats like chicken, beef and pork, vegetables such as sweet potatoes, and savory ingredients like cheese. Specialty versions are also found, such as wild rabbit and leek.\n\nIn the United Kingdom turnovers are usually filled with cooked apples, but any fruit can be used, as descriped by Mrs Beeton in her Book Of Household Management 1861.\n"}
{"id": "2234457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234457", "title": "Fish fry", "text": "Fish fry\n\nA fish fry is a meal containing battered or breaded fried fish. It usually also includes french fries, coleslaw, hushpuppies, lemon slices, tartar sauce, hot sauce, malt vinegar and dessert. Some Native American versions are cooked by coating fish with semolina and egg yolk. \n\nFish is often served on Friday nights during Lent as a restaurant special or through church fundraisers. Beer is a common beverage of choice to accompany a fish fry. A fish fry may include potato pancakes (with accompanying side dishes of sour cream or applesauce) and sliced caraway rye bread if served in a German restaurant or area.\n\nA Shore Lunch is traditional in the northern United States and Canada. For decades outdoor enthusiasts have been cooking their catch on the shores of their favorite lakes. \n\nFish fries are very common in the Midwestern and northeastern regions of the United States. This is especially true for predominantly Roman Catholic communities on Fridays during Lent, when regulations call for abstinence from most meat products.\n\nThe tradition of Christians fasting on Fridays to recognize Jesus's crucifixion on Good Friday dates to the first century AD. Fish had been associated with religious holidays even in pre-Christian times. The first mention of fish in connection with Lent comes from Socrates of Constantinople, a church historian in the third and fourth centuries who spoke of abstaining from meat and meat products (such as cheese and eggs) during the 40 days of Lent. The custom was mentioned by Pope Gregory I, who was elected in 590, and was later incorporated into canon law. Roman Catholic tradition has been that the flesh of warm-blooded animals is off limits on Fridays, although the 1983 Code of Canon Law provided for alternative observances of the Friday penance.\n\nMcDonald's addition of the Filet-o-Fish to its menu occurred when a Cincinnati franchise in a heavily Catholic neighborhood was struggling to sell hamburgers on Fridays during Lent.\n\nBattered or breaded haddock and cod fish fry is one of the trademarks of upstate New York cuisine and northwestern Pennsylvania, especially Albany, Buffalo and Rochester, as well as Syracuse, New York, and Utica, New York. The majority of restaurants in these cities serve a fish fry on Friday, even outside Lent, and it's often available throughout the week. These meals typically consist of a piece of fish, coleslaw (sometimes potato salad or macaroni salad), french fries, and a dinner roll.\n\nIn the southern United States, a fish fry is a family or social gathering, held outdoors or in large halls. At a typical fish fry, quantities of fish (such as bream, catfish, flounder and bass) available locally are battered and deep fried in cooking oil. The batter usually consists of corn meal, milk or buttermilk, and seasonings. In addition to the fish, hushpuppies (deep fried, seasoned corn dumplings), and cole slaw are served. These events are often potluck affairs. In Georgia and South Carolina, fish are dipped in milk, then into a mix of flour, cornmeal and seasonings before frying. Cheese grits is often a side dish.\n\nThe modern fish fry tradition is strong in Wisconsin, where hundreds of eateries hold fish fries on Fridays, and sometimes on Wednesdays. The Friday night fish fry is a popular-year round tradition in Wisconsin among people of all religious backgrounds. Fish fries there are offered at many non-chain restaurants, taverns that serve food, some chain restaurants, and at Roman Catholic churches as fundraisers. A typical Wisconsin fish fry consists of beer batter fried cod, perch, bluegill, walleye, smelt, or in areas along the Mississippi River, catfish. The meal usually comes with tartar sauce, french fries or German-style potato pancakes, coleslaw, and rye bread, though baked beans are not uncommon. The tradition in Wisconsin began because Wisconsin was settled heavily by Catholics of German, Polish, and other backgrounds whose religion forbade eating meat on Fridays. The number of lakes in the state meant that eating fish became a popular alternative. Scandinavian settlements in northern and eastern Wisconsin favored the fish boil, a variant on the fish fry, which involves heating potatoes, white fish, and salt in a large cauldron. \n"}

Corn chips are thick, rigid and very crunchy. Corn chips have the strong aroma and flavor of roasted corn, and are often heavily seasoned with salt.\n\nIn the US, Fritos is one of the oldest and most widely recognized brands of corn chips.\n\nWhile corn chips and tortilla chips are both made from corn, the corn in tortilla chips is subjected to the nixtamalization process, resulting in a milder flavor and aroma, and a less rigid texture. Tortilla chips also tend to be larger, thinner, and less salty than corn chips. \n\nCorn chips are usually eaten alone or with a chip dip. They are a common ingredient in homemade and commercial party mix. In the Southwestern US, a popular dish, Frito pie, is made with corn chips and chili. In some areas, it is popular to pour the chili into a bag of corn chips and eat the mixture directly from the bag.\n"}

It is a traditional dish in Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Mongolia, and Turkey.\n\nThe name \"khash\" originates from the Armenian verb (), which means \"to boil\". The dish, initially called \"khashoy\", is mentioned by a number of medieval Armenian authors, including Grigor Magistros (11th century), Mkhitar Heratsi (12th century), and Yesayi Nchetsi (13th century).\n\nThe Persian term literally means \"trotter\". The combination of a sheep's head and trotters is called , which literally means \"head [and] trotter\" in Persian.\n\nKhash is a purist meal with great parsimony in ingredients. The feet are depilated, cleaned, kept in cold water in order to get rid of bad smell, and boiled in water all night long, until the water has become a thick broth and the meat has separated from the bones. No salt or spices are added during the boiling process. The dish is served hot. One may add salt, garlic, lemon juice, or vinegar according to one's taste. Dried lavash is often crumbled into the broth to add substance. Khash is generally served with a variety of other foods, such as hot green and yellow peppers, pickles, radishes, cheese, and fresh greens such as cress. The meal is almost always accompanied by vodka (preferably mulberry vodka) and mineral water.\n\nIn Georgia, Khashi is served together with onions, milk, salt and chacha. Usually they eat this dish early morning, or during hangovers.\n\nIn the medieval Armenian medical textbook \"Relief of Fevers\" (1184), khash was described as a dish with healing properties, e.g., against snuffle. It was recommended to eat it while drinking wine. In case of ailment, khash from the legs of yeanling was advised.\n\nFormerly a nutritious winter food, it is now considered a delicacy, and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal. Modern-day convention in Armenia dictates that it should be consumed during the month that has an \"r\" in its name, thus excluding May, June, July, and August (\"month names in Armenian are derivatives of the Latin names\"). Khash is traditionally consumed during cold months in Azerbaijan and Georgia.\n\nIn the Caucasus, khash is often seen as a food to be consumed in the mornings after a party, as it is known to battle hangovers (especially by men) and eaten with a \"hair of the dog\" vodka chaser.\n\nThere is much ritual involved in khash parties. Many participants abstain from eating the previous evening, and insist upon using only their hands to consume the unusual (and often unwieldy) meal. Because of the potency and strong smell of the meal, and because it is eaten early in the mornings and so often enjoyed in conjunction with alcohol, khash is usually served on the weekend or on holidays.\n\nKalle-pache (; ; literally meaning \"head [and] trotter\") consists of a sheep's head (including the brain) and trotters, and is typically seasoned with lemon and cinnamon. Usually consumed as a breakfast soup, kalle-pache is traditional to Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nIn Iran, kalle-pache is usually cooked in specialty stores, and is served in the morning. It is especially consumed during cold seasons. To prepare kalle-pache, the sheep's head and trotters are collected, cooked, and treated as per the recipe.\n\nDuring winter it is very common to eat sheep or cow parts soup with onions and spices, especially the legs which is called 'Maraq rigl' it is usually accompanied with an alcoholic drink.\n\nPacha is a traditional Iraqi dish made from sheep's head, trotters, and stomach; all boiled slowly and served with bread sunken in the broth. The cheeks and tongues are considered the best parts. Many people prefer not to eat the eyeballs which could be removed before cooking. The stomach lining would be filled with rice and lamb and stitched with a sewing thread (). Sheep brain is also included.\n\nThe dish is known in Kuwait, Bahrain, and other Persian Gulf countries as \"bacha\" (), since the Arabic alphabet has no letter 'p' so the dish is pronounced with a 'b'. A variation of that is found in other Arab countries such as in Egypt and is known as \"kawari\"' (), Egyptians eat cow brain and sheep brain.\n\nAlbania's popular pache () consists of a sheep's or any cattle's head, that is boiled until meat comes off easily. It is then stewed with garlic, onion, black pepper, and vinegar. Sometimes a little flour is added to thicken the stew. It makes a hot and hearty winter stew.\n\nIn Turkish culinary culture, \"pacha\" ( is a generic word for certain soup preparations, especially with offal, but also without it. In most parts of Turkey, such as in Kastamonu, for instance, the term (\"feet pacha\") is used for cow, sheep, or goat hooves, and the term is used for \"head pacha\" (chorba). Sometimes the term is also used for tongue soup, while \"meat pacha\" is made with (scrag end of sheep's neck). In Turkey, the word refers to a sheep's head roasted in the oven, which is served after grilling at specialized offal restaurants.\n\nThe Greek version, called \"patsás\" (πατσάς), may be seasoned with red wine vinegar and garlic (\"skordostoubi\"), or thickened with avgolémono. The Greek version sometimes uses calf feet with the tripe.\n\nSpecialized tavernas serving patsa are known as \"patsatzidika\". Because patsas has the reputation of remedying hang-over and aiding digestion, \"patsatzidika\" are often working overnight, serving people returning home after dinner or clubbing.\n\n\n"}

They are distinguished from regular military rations by virtue of being designed for minimal preparation in the field, using canned, pre-cooked or freeze-dried foods, powdered beverage mixes and concentrated food bars, as well as for long shelf life.\n\nSuch meals also prove invaluable for disaster relief operations, where large stocks of these can be ferried and distributed easily, and provide basic nutritional support to victims before kitchens can be set up to produce fresh food.\n\nMost armies in the world today now field some form of pre-packaged combat ration, suitably tailored to meet national or ethnic tastes.\n\nTraditionally Hexamine has been the preferred solid fuel for cooking rations. An alternative is gelatinised ethanol.\n\nThe Ración de Combate (Individual) was introduced in 2003, consisting of a gray plastic-foil laminate pouch containing a mix of canned and dehydrated foods, plus minimal supplements, for 1 soldier for 1 day. All products in the RC are domestically produced, commercially available items. Each ration contains: canned meat, small can of meat spread, crackers, instant soup, cereal bar with fruit, a chocolate bar with nuts or caramels, instant coffee, orange juice powder, sugar, salt, a heating kit with disposable stove and alcohol-based fuel tablets, disposable butane lighter, resealable plastic bag, cooked rice and a pack of paper tissues.\n\nMenu #1 contains: corned beef, meat pate, crisp water crackers, and instant soup with fideo pasta.\n\nMenu #2 contains: roasted beef in gravy, meat pate, whole wheat crackers, and quick-cooking polenta in cheese sauce.\n\nThe Ração Operacional de Combate - R2 is the current field & combat ration for the Brazilian Army.

It contains the food and supplemental items needed by 1 soldier for 24 hours. It is to be used in situations where no other type of ration is available. All foods are packed inside 4-ply plastic & aluminum polylaminate retort pouches and are ready to eat without further preparation.\n\nThe ration is packed inside a heavy-duty (.25 mm thick) matte green or olive drab polyethylene bag measuring 300 mm wide by 400 mm long.

This is a 12-hour ration to be used in situations where cooked foods cannot be provided for all meals.\n\nThe ration is similar to the R2 and uses the same components, but contains less food. The bag is printed with the emblem of the Brazilian Army, \"Ração de Emergência R3 (12 Horas)\" and Menu information. Inside are 3 thin plastic bags: 2 meal bags and 1 accessory packet.\n\nInformation from Mreinfo.com.\n\nCanada provides each soldier with a complete pre-cooked meal known as the IMP (Individual Meal Pack), packaged inside a heavy-duty folding paper bag. There are 5 breakfast menus, 6 lunch menus, and 6 supper menus. Canadian rations provide generous portions and contain a large number of commercially available items. Like the US ration, the main meal is precooked and ready-to-eat, packed in heavy-duty plastic-foil retort pouches boxed with cardboard. Typically, the ration contains a meal item (beans and wiener sausages, scalloped potatoes with ham, smoked salmon fillet, macaroni and cheese, cheese omelette with mushrooms, shepherd's pie, etc.), wet-packed (sliced or mashed) fruit in a boxed retort pouch, and depending on the meal a combination of instant soup or cereal, fruit drink crystals, jam or cheese spread, peanut butter, honey, crackers, bread (bun) compressed into a retort pouch, coffee and tea, sugar, commercially available chocolate bars and hard candy, a long plastic spoon, paper towels and wet wipes. Canada also makes limited use of a Light Meal Pack containing dried meat or cheese, dried fruit, a granola bar, a breakfast cereal square, a chocolate bar, hard candy, hot cocoa mix, tea, and two pouches of instant fruit drink. Canadian ration packs also contain a book of cardboard matches.\n\nColombia issues the Ración de Campaña, a very dark olive green (almost black) plastic bag weighing between 1092 and 1205 grams and providing . Inside are the MRE-like retort pouch main courses and supplements needed by 1 soldier for 1 day. The individual meals, which cater to South American tastes, consist of a breakfast, a lunch, and a main meal (Tamal, envueltos, lentils with chorizo, arvejas con carne, garbanzo beans a la madrileña, arroz atollado, ajiaco con pollo, and sudado con papas y carne). The ration also includes bread products, beverage mixes, candy and accessories. All items except the beverage mixes require no further preparation and can be eaten either hot or cold.

It is packaged in an olive green and black plastic box with the contents printed on the front; the box contains three individual meal packs containing meals providing which are meant to sustain a soldier for one day. Each individual meal package contains two main retort pouches which are meant to be eaten with each other. The first retort pouch usually contains a meat product (such as beef, pork, sausage, fish, ham, seafood, chicken, tuna, bacon or other meats which are usually mixed with a flavoring sauce and vegetables) the second retort pouch contains a staple food (rice, hominy, noodles, beans, pasta, eggs or more vegetables). Each meal package also contains salt, spices, condensed milk, cream, butter, chorizo spread, dried fruit or preserves, bread, crackers, sugar, custard, cookies, canned fish, cocoa mix, nuts, chocolate or other candies, vitamins, a large pouch of drinking water, a pouch of Jumex fruit juice or Coca-Cola, biodegradable napkins and utensils and water purification tablets. Some meal packages do not contain the two main retort pouches and instead contain a single larger pouch with a finished meal such as tamales or steak and eggs but, these are usually only available when close to a base or when the military is operating in an urban area. When these were handed out by the Mexican military during their assistance in the Hurricane Katrina relief operation many Americans who received them gave very high praise about their taste and variety.\n\nThe United States' Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) is packaged similarly to the Canadian ration. Each sealed plastic bag contains one entire precooked meal, with a number of supplements and accessories. The original 12 menus have been expanded to 24 and now contain a variety of ethnic and special request items as well. Kosher/Halal and Vegetarian menus are also provided. Each meal bag contains an 8-oz main course (packaged in a four-layer plastic and foil laminate retort pouch), 8 hardtack crackers, some form of spread (cheese, peanut butter, or jelly), a fruit-based beverage powder, some form of dessert (cake, candy, cookies, or fruit), and an accessory packet containing coffee or tea, creamer, sugar, salt, matches, a plastic spoon, and toilet paper. A chemical heater is packed with every meal.\n\nThe First Strike Ration (FSR) is a compact, eat-on-the-move ration to be used for no more than three days during initial periods of highly intense, highly mobile combat assaults. A single FSR (24 hours food) is about 50% of the size and weight of three MREs. Each FSR provides (15% protein, 53% carbohydrates, 34% fat), versus the in three MREs, and has a two-year shelf life when stored at 80 °F. An FSR is packed in a single trilaminate bag and contains filled pocket sandwiches, a pouch of tuna or chicken, two packets of ERGO high-energy drink mix, two high-energy cereal bars (First Strike Bars), a dairy-based calcium-enriched dessert bar, two packets of beef jerky (BBQ or Teriyaki flavored), fortified applesauce, nut and fruit mix, caffeinated gum, and an accessory pack containing a beverage mix, salt, matches, tissues, plastic spoon, and cleansing moist towelettes. The FSR comes in three menus:\n\nAfter joining NATO, the Czechs developed a combat ration known as the Bojová Dávka Potravin (BDP). The BDP comes in two versions, type I and II, each holding two ready-to-eat main courses packed in large foil \"cans\" (beef roast with rice, pork goulash with potato, spicy risotto, pork with carrots and vegetables, etc.), a small plastic cup of lunch meat spread, cheese spread, hard bread, cookies, jam, instant coffee, tea bags, fruit-flavored multivitamin drink tablets, vitamin C enriched fruit drink powder, a chocolate bar, sugar, salt, chewing gum, wet napkins, paper towels, a plastic bag, and a menu and instruction sheet. A modified version of the BDP known as the KDP (Konzervovaná Dávka Potravin) is also used. This contains the same items as the BDP, but adds an aluminium cup, plastic utensils, a folding stove with fuel tablets and matches, and soap.\n\nThe Danish military developed a modern field ration inspired by Norwegian and American rations. It consist of Drytech freeze-dried main meals and several additional items such as dried fruits and nuts, energy bars, hard biscuits, meat pate etc.\n\nWhen (during peacetime) conscript soldiers are not provided with meals cooked either in garrisons or attached field kitchens, they are provided with rations (colloquially known as sissi rations) packed in a clear plastic bag. Several different menus exist, however all include foil packed crispbread, coffee and tea, sugar, chocolate, small tins of beef or pork, chewing gum, dry porridge, energy drink powder etc. Soups and porridges that are meant to be mixed with water and cooked are usually prepared in Trangia-type portable stoves that are shared by the pair in a fire and maneuver team, or in individual mess kits.\n\nThe French 24-hour combat ration, the RCIR (ration de combat individuelle réchauffable) comes in 14 menus packed in a small cardboard box. Inside are two pre-cooked, ready-to-eat meal main courses packed in thin metal cans somewhat like oversized sardine tins, and an hors d'oeuvre in a more conventional can or tin. Current main courses include items such as beef salad, tuna and potatoes, salmon with rice and vegetables, shepherd's pie, rabbit casserole, chili con carne, paella, veau marengo (veal), navarin d'agneau (lamb), poultry and spring vegetables, etc. Hors d'oeuvres include: salmon terrine, chicken liver, tuna in sauce, fish terrine, duck mousse, etc. Each meal box also contains a package of instant soup, hard crackers, cheese spread, chocolate, caramels or boiled sweets, instant café-au-lait, sugar, cocoa powder, matches, a disposable folding ration heater and fuel tablets, and water purifying tablets.\n\nGermany uses the \"Einmannpackung\" (EPA) to provide two substantial meals to each soldier. Practice is to provide one hot cooked meal for the other meal whenever possible. A heater or oven is not included since an Esbit cooker is part of each soldier's personal equipment. Enough food items are contained within the EPA to sustain the soldier for 24 hours. Currently there are three menus; each includes two meals out of a selection of 19 meals, with several heavy-duty foil trays containing items such as lentils with sausages, Yugoslav Sausage, Goulash, beef patties in tomato sauce, Italian pasta, or Tofu stir-fry. There are also three smaller foil \"cans\" of bread spreads such as cheese spread, liver-sausage, dried-meat sausage, or cheese spread with green peppers. The meal box also includes: thinly sliced rye bread (170 g), hard crackers (1100 kcal), a foil can of fruit salad, instant cream of wheat, instant fruit juice powder, instant coffee, instant tea, powdered cream, a chocolate bar, sugar, salt, gum, jam, water purifying tablets, two plastic bags, matches, paper towels and a user guide.\n\nThe EPa ration of the Bundeswehr is supplied in two types, rations 1 to 5 are packaged in a grey cardboard box with the meals packaged in sealed heavy duty foil trays which may be heated by immersing in hot water. The trays are opened using a knife or other sharp implement. Rations 6 to 19 are packaged in a resealable carry pouch, which is NATO Olive, desert brown or transparent. The meals are packed in retort pouches.\n\nRations 6 to 19 are packaged in a resealable carry pouch, which is NATO Olive, desert brown or transparent. The meals are packed in retort pouches.\nLike other German rations, is packed in a resealable carry pouch with the meals in retort pouches.\nThe Wehrmacht in the field were provided rations from field kitchens based on the garrison ration. However additional classes of ration were available. The march ration was a cold food ration issued for not more than three or four consecutive days to units in transit either on carrier or by foot. It consisted of approximately 700 grams of bread, 200 grams of cold meat or cheese, 60 grams of bread spreads, 9 grams of coffee (or 4 grams of tea), 10 grams of sugar, and six cigarettes. Thus it had a total weight of about 980 grams. An iron ration consisted of 250 grams of biscuits, 200 grams of cold meat, 150 of preserved vegetables, 25 of coffee, and 25 of salt. Total weight was 650 grams without packing and 825 grams with packing. An iron half-ration was composed of 250 grams of biscuits and 200 grams of preserved meat; thus its total weight was 450 grams without packing and 535 grams with packing.\n\nThe primary operational ration used in Greece is the so-called \"Merida Eidikon Dynameon\" (Special Forces' Ration, also known as a 4B-ration), a 24-hour ration pack inside a cardboard box measuring 240 x 140 x 130 mm & weighing 1 kg. Most items are commercially procured, with the main meals in round pull-ring cans. Typical contents include: a 200 g canned meat (\"SPAM\"); 280 g can of meat with vegetables (beef and potatoes, etc.) (termed Prepared Food With Meat or ΠΦΜΚ); a 280 g can of cooked vegetables (green peas, etc.) (Prepared Food Without Meat or ΠΦΑΚ); an 85 g can of cheese; 6 hard biscuits; 40 g honey; three 50 g packages of raisins or chocolate; 30 g sugar; 1.5 g black tea, 2 g instant coffee; 19 g instant milk powder; two small packets of salt; a multivitamin tablet; 4 water purification tablets; a pack of tissues; a disposable ration heater with 5 fuel tablets; and a box of matches. In wartime, packs of locally commandeered cigarettes may also be issued.\n\nIreland fields a 24-hour ration pack somewhat similar to that used by the British. It is packed in a large ziplock plastic bag and contains two pre-cooked main meals and items to be eaten throughout the day. Included are: instant soup, ramen noodles, an oatmeal block, a high-energy protein bar, both brown and fruit biscuits, sweets, and a selection of beverage mixes. Breakfast (bacon and beans or sausage and beans) is packaged in a retort pouch while dinner (Beef Casserole, Irish Stew, Chicken Curry, or a vegetarian main course) comes in either a flat tin or microwaveable plastic tray. Desserts consist of a retort-pouched dessert (chocolate pudding, syrup pudding, fruit dumplings), a Kendal mint cake, and a roll of fruit lozenges.

The ration pack provides breakfast and lunch only; the two canned or pouched main meals are issued separately.\n\nThe Swedish armed forces use ration packs from the Swedish developers 24 hour meals. 24 hour meals have a long range of menus (approx. 200) and can deliver both freezedried and wet meals. The Swedish concept (combat edition) consists of several versions for different use, in all climate zones, and various types of missions. Examples of different types of rations: 1-course (patrolration), 2-course, 3-course and 4-course versions with a variation of 40 different meals, both wet and dry. The rations varies from 1300 kcal to 5000 kcal. The ration is packed in a transparent durable plastic bag that is resealable with a ziplock. The contents are 1-4 main meals with energy bars, protein bars, nuts, energy drinks, wholewheat bread, peanut butter, desserts and spices for example. The durable bag change size depending on the version for optimal space usage in cartons and soldiers' backpacks. 24 hour meals have been developed at a rapid pace and are currently producing their 5th generation (first in 2008). R&D are working close with soldiers in Scandinavia and various missions around the world.\n\nNorway utilize a 24-hour ration pack (Norwegian \"feltrasjon\") designed by Drytech, consisting of 2 freeze-dried main meals, a packet of compressed breakfast cereal, packets of instant soup, and supplements. These are packed in 3 green polylaminate bags labelled \"Breakfast,\" \"Lunch,\" or \"Dinner,\" overwrapped in clear plastic and issued as one day's ration.

However, in its most frequent form it isn't dietary complete, and is intended only as a stop-gap measure to be issued until the normal supply lines (with their field kitchens) are established and the hot food delivery started, to be issued for no more than six days straight. Russian Ministry of defence doesn't strictly prescribe the contents of the ration, only some basic packaging and inventory requirements, so every producer issues their own version. Most commonly it is packaged into a sturdy plastic blister box (nicknamed \"The Frog\" in the field for its olive-green color), or plastic-sealed cardboard box that contains five to six entrees in laminated foil cans or retort pouches, four to six pack of crackers or preserved bread, two to three dessert items in form of a spread or fruit bar, four beverage concentrate pouches, some seasonings (salt, pepper, sugar, ketchup), and various sundry items like sanitizing wipes/paper towels, spoons, can opener, four hexamine fuel tablets, folding heater, matches and water purifier tablets. The types of entrees vary with the producer and the issued menu (of which there are usually 7 to 12), but the common set is based on a traditional Russian outdoorsmen fare, is largely formed out of the commercially available canned food, and usually includes 1 portion of stewed beef or pork, two meat-with-vegetables dishes, like various porridges, stews or canned fish, and one or two spreads, such as liver pate, sausage stuffing or processed cheese. Desserts may include fruit jams, chocolate and/or walnut spreads, chocolate bars, sweetened condensed milk, etc., but baked goods are usually avoided out of concerns about their shelf life. Other variants may add canned speck and/or dried fish or exchange the hexamine tablets for the flameless heater.\n\nThe Spanish Army issues an individual meal pack, available in 5 different menus, comprising a small cardboard box overwrapped with drab green polyethylene. Inside are 3 canned meals, plus accessories. Typical contents (Menu B) include: stewed steak, pickled mackerel, liver pâté with red peppers, an envelope of instant soup, a can of fruit, 2 salt tablets, 2 water purification tablets, a large multivitamin tablet, 10 sheets of general purpose paper, a book of matches, a folding can opener, a small folding ration heater and 2 fuel tablets, and an instruction sheet in three languages (Spanish, English and French). Crackers or bread are issued separately.\n\nThe 12 hour operational ration pack (ORP) is designed for patrolling for durations of 4–12 hours and for is suitable for remote guard posts, drivers and as a supplement to normal rations for where daily calorie expenditure is likely to exceed 6000 kcal (25,120 kJ)(for instance, troops undergoing arduous duties.)\n\nThe 12 hour ORP contains a main meal packed in a retort pouch, a number of snack items, drink powders and a flameless ration heater (FRH). However it does not contain any hot beverage items.\n\nThere are 10 menu choices including one vegetarian.\nThe 12 hour ORP provides a minimum of 2000 kcals (8,374 kJ).\n\nThe UK provides the Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose. Packed inside a small cardboard box, each ration has enough retort-pouched and canned foods to feed one soldier for 24 hours. Seven menus (plus vegetarian and religious variants) provide two precooked meals (Breakfast and Main Meal) plus a midday snack. Example (Menu A) Breakfast: Hamburger and beans, Instant Porridge. All ration packs also contain Oatmeal Block, Fruit Biscuits, Biscuits Brown (a more compact alternative to bread), a sachet of instant soup and jam or yeast extract (a Marmite like spread) for a lunchtime snack, and chocolate (in the form of a specially made Yorkie bar which is flatter than civilian bars, or, more recently, a simple unbranded bar of milk chocolate), though this has been phased out with the introduction of the more recent multi-climate ration packs, and boiled sweets (hard candy) for snacking whilst on patrol, or in free time. Main Meal: Instant soup, Chicken with Mushroom and Pasta, Treacle Pudding. Each pack also contains instant coffee, tea bags, creamer, sugar, hot cocoa mix, beef/vegetable stock powder, lemon/orange powder or Lucozade electrolyte powder, matches, packet of tissues, chewing-gum, a small bottle of Tabasco sauce, and water purifying tablets. They sometimes also contain chicken and herb pâté. Also available are Kosher/Halal, Vegetarian, and Hindu/Sikh specific menus. Regardless of their contents, these ration packs are referred to as Rat-Packs or Compo (short for Composite Rations) by the soldiers who eat them. In addition to containing the 24-hour ration, the outside of the cardboard box has a range card printed on its side for use by the soldier to record key features and their range from their position. Other variations designed for specific environments exist.\n\nThe rations are now being issued with a new folding cooker and fire-lighting fuel called FireDragon made in Wales by BCB International Ltd\n\nThe 24 Hour Jungle ration is based on the standard 24 Hour ration with additional supplements and a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH). The Jungle ration is designed for use by the special forces and other specialist units.\n\nThe 24 Hour Jungle Ration provides a minimum of 4500 kcals (18,840 kJ) a day.\n\nThe Cold Climate Ration (CCR) is a specialist and lightweight, high calorie 24 hour ration designed for use by troops above the snow line or in the high Arctic. It comprises mainly dehydrated main meals with a range of snacks designed to be eaten on the go.\n\nThere are 8 menu choices available.\n\nThe cold climate ration provides a minimum of 5500 kcals (23,030 kJ) a day.\n\nThe UK also fields a larger pack of rations intended to feed ten soldiers for 24 hours from centralised but basic preparation; generally similar in content to the single issue ORP but tending to contain larger quantities of food in cylindrical tin cans to be divided up on preparation, rather than individual retort pouches or packets. Even dry materials like sugar or biscuits are often packed in these cans. They contain ingredients for baking bread and tinned food, including vegetables, corned beef and sausages in lard. Also included are chocolate, pre-cooked chicken or beef in gravy and soya mince. Ten boxed one-man ORPs are supplied in larger boxes identical in shape to the single ten-man pack.\n\nThe Mark 4 EFR is designed for crews of fast jets. It consists of a flat tin it contains 100 g of fruit flavoured sweets, (9 to be eaten each day) 2 spring handles and a plastic bag. The container can be used for boiling water and hot drinks can be made by dissolving the sweets in hot water. The Mark 4 EFR is built into ejector seats.\n\nThe Mark 9 EFR is designed for crews of multi-engine aircraft. It consists of a two piece aluminium container, four wire spring handles, two emergency food packs (eight portions per pack), one packet of beef stock drinking cubes (six cubes per pack), two packets of sugar cubes (twelve cubes per pack), one beverage pack (containing seven sachets of instant coffee, four sachets of instant tea and seven sachets of vegetable creamer), two spatulas, one polythene bag and an instruction leaflet.\n\nThe cost of a 10-man ration pack is £55.00. The cost of a 24-hour operational ration pack is £10.00\n\nIn 1943, The 24 Hour Ration was devised as a direct replacement to the 48 Hour Mess tin ration. It contained only dried goods (no tins), to save weight and tinplate, which was the criticism of the earlier mess tin ration. It was first issued to troops on D-Day to provide interim food prior to supply lines being established which would permit 14 Man Composition Rations being brought ashore. \nThere were two packs (contents identical), the standard 24 Hour Ration and the 24 Hour Ration (Assault), the former fitting into the larger portion of the mess tin and the latter fitting into the smaller portion. The pack provided approximately 4000 calories.\nThe contents of the ration pack were as follows, most of which were wrapped in either cellophane or in white, heat-sealed wax paper with royal blue writing;\n\n1 Block of dried meat (beef or lamb),\n2 sweetened oatmeal blocks,\nTea, Milk and sugar cubes,\n10 biscuits (plain, service),\n2 bars of raisin chocolate,\n1 bar of vitamin enriched chocolate (vit. A, B, C, D and Calcium),\n4 ounces of boiled sweets,\n2 packets of peppermint chewing gum,\n4 meat extract cubes,\n4 cubes of sugar,\nSalt,\n4 sheets of Latrine paper.\n\nInformation taken from DSIR 26-344 ration specifications, 1944 and Supplies and Transport, 1954.\n\nThe 24 hour GS (General Service) ration pack was supplied with the contents in cans or packets.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Biscuits AB stands for \"Biscuits-Alternative Bread\", these were called more colourful names by members of the British Army due to the fact they caused constipation.\n\nThe 24 hour GS (General Service) ration pack was supplied with the contents in cans or packets.\nArctic rations were dehydrated and issued to troops serving in arctic areas where snow could be melted to rehydrate the dehydrated contents.\nIn the 1990s cans were replaced with retort pouches and menu options improved and expanded. The ration was redesignated as the 24 Hour General Purpose (GP) Ration Pack.\n The Ukrainian combat ration is based on a previous Russian version, consisting of commercially available cans and dried foods packed together in a sectioned box (resembles a takeout tray) made of very thin green plastic. Inside are: two 250 g mmin Meal cans (boiled buckwheat groats and buckwheat w/beef); two 100 g cans of meat spread (liver pate and beef in lard); a 160 g can of herring or mackerel; six 50 g packages small, hard crackers (resemble oyster crackers); two foil pouches (20 g each) of jam or jelly; six boiled sweets two tea bags; an envelope of instant cherry juice powder; a chicken flavour bouillon cube; two packets of sugar; and three dining packets, each with a plastic spoon, a napkin, and a moist towelette.\n\nDeveloped and fielded the Ração Individual de Combate (RIC). Packed in a camouflage cardboard box measuring 265 mm × 160 mm × 90 mm (10.5 in × 6.25 in × 19.0 in) and weighing 1.99 kg (3.4 lbs), the ration provides 3 meals per day. Maximum use is made of off-the-shelf commercial items, including canned main menu items (still with their original labels). A typical RIC (menu 4) will contain: two 415 g \"poptop\" cans (beef w/vegetables and chili con carne), a flat 115 g can of sardines, round 65 g can of liver paste, sweet bread, crackers, packaged bread, 2 pouches of fruit jam, pouch of quince cream, hot chocolate or instant coffee, isotonic drink mix, instant milk powder, chewing gum, boiled sweets, sugar, salt, water purification tablets, matches, 6 fuel tablets, a folding stove, plastic cutlery, a pack of tissues, a plastic bag, and an instruction/menu sheet.\n\nThe Israeli \"battle ration\" (Manat Krav) is designed to be shared by four soldiers. It contains: 1 can of rice filled vine leaves, 8 small cans of tuna, canned olives, a can of sweet corn, a can of pickled cucumbers, 1 can of halva spread and 1 chocolate spread, a can of peanuts, fruit flavored drink powder, and bread or matzoh crackers. There is also an \"ambush pack\" of candy and high-energy protein bars.\n\nIn 2008, Israel introduced a new field ration to supplement the traditional Manat Krav. Unlike previous rations, the new Battle Ration consists of individual, self-heating, ready-to-eat meals packed inside plastic-aluminum trays. They are designed to be carried and used by infantry troops for up to 24 hours, until regular supply lines can be established. Ten menus are available, including chicken, turkey and kebab; each meal pack is supplemented with dry salami, dried fruit, tuna, halva, sweet roll, and preserved dinner rolls. However, as of 2012, the older rations were still in use.\n\nIn 2011, as a result of the manufacturer going bankrupt, the IDF phased out the can of corned beef (known as 'Loof'), which had been part of the battle ration since the nation's founding. It would be replaced by \"ground meat with tomato sauce\".\n\nMany different recipes and different ways of serving the rations have developed in Israel. With the can of tuna, for example, traditionally cooked using toilet paper soaked in oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia uses a combat meal that is packed inside a brown plastic bag about the size and shape of a US MRE pouch. It contains a small can of tuna, a small can of sardines or salmon or beef, a small can of cheese or thickened cream, an envelope of instant noodle soup, hard crackers and dry toast (like Zwieback), a small bag of raisins or dried fruit, a small package of dates, a small bag of nuts, plus instant coffee, tea bags, sugar packets, matches, and a bag of spiced dried chickpea powder.\n\nThe UAE utilizes a European-style combat ration pack containing food and accessories for one soldier for 24 hours. Packed in the UAE utilizing imported components, the ration box measures 245 mm × 195 mm × 115 mm and weighs 2.0 kg. Inside are 4 resealable (ziplock type) plastic bags, labeled in both Arabic & English, containing Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Miscellaneous.\n\nA typical Breakfast bag has 2 foil-wrapped packages of hard brown biscuits, 1 small jar of apricot jam, a can of tuna, and an accessory pack (plastic spoon, salt, pepper, and napkin).\n\nLunch contains a retort pouch of precooked rice, a retort pouch of chicken curry, a pouch date pudding, and another accessory pack.\n\nDinner has a retort pouch of pasta rigatoni, an envelope instant soup, and a third accessory pack.\n\nThe Miscellaneous bag contains a small bag of hard candy, 4 packets of sugar, 4 tea bags, 2 small envelopes of milk powder, and 3 foil envelopes of instant orange juice powder.\n\nAlso included are: a can of fruit, a package of ramen noodles, 2 flameless chemical ration heaters, a menu/instruction sheet, 1 pack dried hummus powder, and a book of matches.\n\nAustralia currently supplies three different types of military ration packs – Combat Ration One Man, Combat Ration Five Man and Patrol Ration One Man.\n\nCombat Ration One Man is a complete 24-hour ration pack that provides two substantial meals per day and a wide variety of drinks and snacks for the remainder of the day. Most items, such as Beef Kai Si Ming, Dutch-style Beef with Vegetables, Beef with Spaghetti, Baked Beans, Sausages with Vegetables, or Chicken with pasta and vegetables, are packed in 250 gram sized plastic-foil retort pouches. Included with every meal pack is a pouch of instant rice or instant mashed potatoes, a fruit and grain bar, 2 envelopes of instant drink powder, some biscuits, an \"Anzac Biscuit,\" a chocolate bar, M&M's, coffee, tea, sugar, crackers, cheese spread, jam, sweetened condensed milk, hard sweets, and Vegemite. It is packed in a tough clear polyethylene bag and weighs around 1.5 – 1.7 kg (3.3 – 3.75 lb). In practical use, these packs are \"stripped\" by removing and trading with other soldiers, those components that are unlikely to be consumed by the person carrying the pack. This also reduces the weight of the packs, allowing more to be carried. There are eight menu choices, one of which is vegetarian. None of them are allergen free since Defence Force members are typically selected, among many other attributes, for their no known allergy status.\n\nCombat Ration Five Man contains a similar array of components as the Combat Ration One Man. However, it is provided in a tough fibreboard carton rather than in individual unitised polyethylene bags. It is a group feeding solution, and it is impractical to use on an individual basis for main meals. There are a multiple of group-sized retort pouches – 500 gram as opposed to 250 gram, several of which are required to be heated in order to provide a complete meal. Examples include Beef & Blackbean Sauce, Chicken Satay. Common elements include rice and vegetables such as corn, potatoes and carrots. The accessories such as snacks are consumable and can be carried individually. There are five menu choices, and each Combat Ration Five Man weighs around 10 kg (22 lb).\n\nPatrol Ration One Man is a complete 24-hour ration pack that contains freeze dried main meals, meaning that the total weight of each pack is reduced, however a correspondingly higher quantity of water must be carried in order to reconstitute the main meal. Otherwise, it is similar to the Combat Ration One Man. It is packed in tough clear polyethylene bags and is available in five menu choices.\n\nNew Zealand issues an Operational Ration Pack designed to provide one soldier with three complete meals. Based around two ready-to-eat retort pouches (e.g. Lamb Casserole, Chicken Curry), the ORP comes in 4 menus. Also included are: Anzac biscuits, chocolate bars, URC fruit grains, muesli bars, instant soup powder, instant noodles, muesli cereal, a tube of condensed milk, hard crackers, tinned cheese, cocoa powder, instant coffee, tea bags, instant sport drink powder, sugar, salt, pepper, glucose sweets, Marmite, jam, ketchup, onion flakes, waterproofed matches, a resealable plastic bag, and a menu sheet.\n\nThe Patrol Ration Pac (PRP) is a shelf-stable product that provides an efficient, flexible and nutritionally robust feeding method. The PRP is designed to cover activities when you have access to other food sources during the day and is ideal to replace a single meal or provide snack options. The PRP provides approximately one-third of the energy and nutrient requirements of most military personnel during moderate, prolonged-intensity physical activity, in a temperate environment. Therefore, it is desirable that all of the food in the pack is eaten.\n\nMenus A, B and C contain main meals that can be heated using a flameless ration heater along with other ready to eat foods and a beverage powder. Menu D provides ready to eat snack foods and no beverage powder.\n\nThe Royal Brunei Army uses a 24-hour ration pack that provides a soldier with an entire day's supply of food, plus a limited number of health and hygiene items. Maximum use is made of plastic-foil laminate pouches, and most items can be eaten without further preparation. Currently, four menus are fielded, and all menus are compatible with Muslim dietary restrictions. Example Menu (F): 5 x 170-gram retort pouches (Biriani Chicken, Mutton Curry, Sardines in Tomato Sauce, Bubur Jagong/ Corn Porridge, Pineapple Pajeri); plus individual servings of pineapple jam, instant coffee, teabags, sugar, salt, pepper, steminder powder, hot chili sauce, MSG, a multivitamin energy tablet, tissue paper, scouring pad with soap, and matches.\n\nIndian Armed Forces have a host of Meals Ready To Eat (MRE) including the One Man Combo Pack Ration, Mini Combo Pack, Survival Ration, a ration for marine commandos and Main Battle Tank (MBT) Rations. The shelf-life of the ration is 12 months. India has adopted retort processing technology for combat rations.\n\nThe MREs use pre-cooked thermostabilized entrees in a plastic-foil laminate retort pouch. The ration does not require cooking and the contents may be eaten cold, though warming is preferred. An entire day's worth of food, plus accessory items, is packed inside a heavy-duty olive green plastic bag with pasted on label. The menu consists of several different Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian products that cater to Indian tastes, such as \"sooji halwa\", \"chapaties\", tea mix, chicken biryani, chicken curry, mutton biryani, Mutton curry, Vegetable biryani, \"rajma\" curry, \"dal\" fry, \"jeera\" rice, Dal makhani, vegetable \"pulav\" and mixed vegetable curry, alongside pickled hot seasoning, in small plastic pouches.\n\nThe One Man Combo Pack consists of early morning tea, breakfast, mid morning tea, lunch, evening tea, and dinner. The menus feature both dehydrated and ready-to-eat products, and include a folding stove and hexamine fuel tablets. The ration weighs 880 grams and provides . The Mini Combo Pack is a simplified version of the One Man Combo Pack, weighing 400 g and providing .\n\nThe survival ration consists of a soft bar and \"chikki\". The daily survival ration per man consists of: Soft bar 100 g x 2, Chikki (sugar base) 50 g x 3, Chikki (Jaggery base) 50 g x 3. This provides around , which is more than the normal survival ration used by most nations.\n\nUniquely, India also developed an operational ration pack specifically for Main Battle Tank (MBT) and other Armored vehicle crews. Designed to sustain four soldiers for 72 h in closed-in battle conditions, the MBT ration is based on instant/ready to eat foods and ration/survival bars. First and second day ration packs weigh 2 kg each and provide per soldier, while the third day ration pack weighs 1.5 kg and supplies .\n\nThe Indonesian military has introduced the RTP (equivalent to Individual Combat Rations) in the mid-1970s in order to standardize nutrition for soldiers in field. There are three types of ration and each daily ration consist of three menus and a pack of supplementary drinks, providing in total. Sample menu for type C is Javanese fried rice, Balinese-sauce fried rice, and chicken rice. The supplementary drinks are instant coffee, powdered orange juice, tea bags and powdered milks. All rations should be heated for 15 minutes over fire. Virtually all products are made in Indonesia and manufactured according to Indonesian military standard.\n\nThe Japan Self-Defense Forces utilize two types of combat rations, Type I combat ration (戦闘糧食 I型) and Type II combat ration (戦闘糧食 II型). The older Type I ration consists almost entirely of canned foods weighing a total of 780 g per meal; a normal three-day ration has up to 36 cans weighing more than 7 kilograms. Eight menus are available, based around a 400 g can of rice and 2-3 smaller supplemental cans. Typical contents include: rice (white rice, sekihan (rice with red beans), mixed rice with vegetables, or rice with mushrooms), a main meal can (chicken and vegetables, beef with vegetables, fish and vegetables, or hamburger patties), pickled vegetables (Takuan(yellow radish) or red cabbage) and sometimes a supplemental can (tuna in soy or beef in soy). In the latest type I combat rations, cans have been replaced by retort pouches.\n\nThe newer, lighter Type II ration was originally intended to replace the Type I and consists of pre-cooked, ready-to-eat items in plastic-foil laminate retort pouches, packed in turn inside a drab green polyethylene meal bag. Each meal consists of two 200 g pouches of rice (white rice, rice with red beans, mixed rice with meat and vegetables, fried rice, curried rice pilaf, rice with green peas, or rice with wild herbs) plus 2-3 supplementary pouches. Main meal pouches contain: hamburger patties, frankfurters, beef curry, grilled chicken, Chinese meatballs, Sweet and Sour pork, grilled salmon, Yakitori chicken, mackerel in ginger sauce, chicken and vegetables, and tuna.

Most items are domestically procured and cater to local tastes and religious dietary requirements. The ration makes extensive use of commercially available canned and dehydrated items. Wherever possible, plastic-foil pouches are used instead of cans. The ration is supplemented with precooked or freeze-dried rice. Example menu C: Beef Kurma, Chicken Masak Merah, Fish Curry, and Sambal Shrimp; Bean Curd and Vegetable mix; long bean stew; canned pineapple and canned papaya; 2 packages of quick-cooking porridge (black bean porridge and flour porridge); military biscuits; jam; instant coffee; tea; instant milk powder; sugar; salt; vitamin tablets; matches; and napkins.\n\nThe Chinese People's Liberation Army has recently introduced a new set of rations consisting of pre-packaged single-person meals sealed in hard plastic retort pouches. The Chinese military rations are of two types: Instant Meal Individual (three-item menu) and Self-Heating Individual (twelve-item menu) (Type 13 and 09). A typical Chinese breakfast ration contains roughly and includes a compressed food packet, an energy bar, an egg roll with pork, pickled mustard tuber, and a powdered beverage pack. Each Self-Heating package comes with an insulated flameless heater that is activated by water.\n\nThe Philippine Army formerly had a combat ration similar to those of the United States Army. Typically, they include a small can of sardines or tuna, instant noodles, crackers, instant coffee, a small packet of peanuts, ginger tea, and a biscuit or cookie. Chocolate manufactured for hot conditions are sometimes issued. Canned rice is also issued.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will get new \"Ready-to-Eat\" rations.They are packed in green plastic retort pouches, and are halal to be considered fit to eat for Muslim service members. Menu no 2 for example, has four packs of cooked rice, one tuna rice with sisig, one pack of chicken sausage with sauce, one pack of chicken lechon paksiw, one pack of powdered milk, one pack of 3-in-1 coffee, one plain cracker, a sfork, and wet tissues.\n\nThe Singapore Armed Forces issues three types of combat rations – Type M (Muslim), Type N (Non-Muslim), and Type V (Vegetarian). Each type comes in 4 or 5 different menus, packed in a heavy-duty green plastic bag similar to a US MRE bag, but measuring 205 mm x 190 mm x 115 mm (8\" x 7.5\" x 4.5\") and weighing 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). Most items are retort-pouched (in the form of a watery paste and eaten straight from the pouch) and (except for the hot beverages) can be eaten without further preparation. The ration provides three meals and a variety of between-meal snacks, averaging per day. Each ration bag includes 2 retort-pouched main courses, a dessert, and an accessory pack containing 2 fruit bars, 4 packages of cookies, an envelope of isotonic drink mix powder, an envelope of instant flavored tea mix, a hot beverage (coffee, cocoa, or tea), an envelope of cereal mix, candy, matches, fuel tablets, and tissue paper. A package of instant noodles is provided with every meal pack, but is issued separately. Typical Type M (Menu #1): Rendang Mutton with rice; Tandoori Chicken with rice; Red Bean dessert.

It is issued to soldiers at the rate of one per soldier per day, and contains both food and sundry items designed to sustain troops where food storage and preparation facilities are not practical. All meals are precooked, requiring neither cooking nor preparation, and all items are packaged inside sealed plastic packages or lightweight aluminium cans. Precooked rice is included as part of every meal. Typical contents are: chicken curry with potatoes, vegetable curry, precooked rice, hard crackers, processed cheese, soup cubes, instant milk powder, orange drink powder, and dates or dried pineapple. A sundry pack containing tea bags, sugar, salt, glucose tablets, seasonings, matches, plastic bags, and toilet paper is included with every ration pack.\n\nThe modern Korean army issues 2 types of field rations, Type I and Type II. Type I ration has ready-to-eat foods packed in foil-plastic trilaminate pouches, placed in turn inside a thin cardboard box. Typical contents include: 1 pouch (250 g) precooked white rice with meat and vegetables, plus a separate seasoning packet; 1 pouch (250 g) precooked rice with red beans; 1 packet (100 g) of 6 pork sausages in BBQ; 1 packet (100 g) kimchi; and 1 packet (50 g) cooked black beans. The Type II ration is a smaller, lighter, freeze-dried single-meal ration consisting of several small pouches packed inside a larger gray plastic pouch measuring 225 mm x 200 mm x 90 mm and weighing 278 g. Typical contents include: freeze dried rice (various flavors, usually with meat and vegetables included), a pouch of instant soup, flavored sesame oil, seasoning and spice packets, dried chives and chocolate.\n\nNATO defines a \"General Purpose Individual Operational Ration\" as \"A self-contained combat ration that provides adequate food for 24 hours for one person to maintain health, physical performance, and cognitive function under routine training or operational conditions. This ration is shelf stable and may require water to rehydrate some of the contents. The contents may be eaten hot or cold. General purpose individual operational rations are intended to be used during standard military operations in very broad but typically moderate operational conditions.\"\n\nThe shelf life of the ration from the time of delivery to the contracting authority must be at least 24 months at a storage temperature of 25 °C.\n\nNATO bases the nutritional content requirement on a reference soldier weighing 79 kg (174 lb, 12 St), who on normal operations would have an energy expenditure of approximately 3,600 kcal per day. For combat operations, i.e., missions involving sustained, dismounted light-infantry or Special Forces operations energy expenditure is estimated to be 4,900 kcal per day, however this is seen to be a worst-case scenario. Operational individual rations are designed to be used for a period of 30 days after which supplements of fresh food be given and medical screening for nutritional deficiencies be increased.\nTo avoid menu fatigue resulting from lack of variety in the ration, all 24-hour operational rations should, at a minimum, include:\nThe 21-meal, 7-day menu cycle shall offer sufficient variety to at least allow a soldier to have two different meals each day for a period of 7 days, without repetition, although a breakfast meal and a variety of small snack and beverage items may be repeated. It is recommended that coffee and/or tea be provided for each meal.\n\nIt is desirable that the main course components and hot beverages be provided with a heater to enable these components to be heated to at least 62 °C from an ambient temperature of 20 °C in maximum 12 minutes. However, main course components or entrées must be consumable without heating.\n\nIt is desirable that all necessary equipment to heat and consume an individual ration be included in the ration pack. Every ration or meal shall contain at least a spoon, unless all food items are intended as eat-out-of-hand and do not require any eating utensils for consumption.\n\nWater treatment items are not required in the individual ration pack. If any water treatment items are included in the individual ration packs, their primary packaging should clearly mention that these items are for water treatment only (and not for direct consumption).\n\nSome rations include a separate bag intended for collection and disposal of packing materials or packaging waste generated from consuming/using the ration components. However, if no separate refuse bag is provided with the ration, some portion of the ration packaging shall be usable or easily adaptable as a means to collect miscellaneous packaging waste that is generated.\n\nProtective packaging of components or items in a ration that are typically in contact with the product or food items is referred to as primary packaging. Secondary packaging is that packaging which is outside the primary packaging layer and in the case of general purpose individual operational rations this packaging is used to group several primary packages together. Lastly, tertiary packaging is that used to support bulk storage, shipping, and handling of product in the distribution supply chain. Rations are grouped at this level in fibreboard boxes or cases and subsequently palletised as unit loads for ease and efficiency of handling and distribution.\n\nIt is preferable that the packaging be easily opened without specific tools. If specific tools are required, they should be included in the ration pack, or alternatively a set should exist containing the ration pack and all necessary specific tools.\n\nPrimary and/or secondary packaging should be waterproof. Secondary packaging should be insect resistant. Tertiary packaging must be water resistant.\n\nIt is recommended that the rations be stacked on NATO type pallets (1200 x 1000 millimeters) for standardisation purposes. The minimum number of rations on a pallet position (i.e., on one single or on two stacked pallets) shall be 150 days of supply (DOS). The height and weight for a single pallet position, including the pallet(s), shall not exceed 2.2 meters and 1000 kg respectively. A pallet of rations must contain different menus.\n\n\n"}

It is referenced in the diaries of Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania circa 1776. It was a treat sold at fairs or consumed at other festive occasions. The corn, oil, sugar, and salt are cooked together in a cast iron kettle, or possibly a Dutch oven. This produces a noticeable sweet crust on the popcorn; however, this method requires constant stirring or the sugar will burn. Alternatively, a batch of plain popped corn can be sweetened with sugar or honey before adding salt. This combination was widely popular in the early 19th century but fell from wide usage during the 20th century.\n\nIn the early 21st century, kettle corn made a comeback in America, especially at 19th-century living history events. It is cooked and sold at fairs and flea markets throughout the United States, especially art and craft shows. Although modern kettle corn is commonly cooked in stainless steel or copper kettles because of their lighter weight, cast iron cauldrons are still used to publicly cook the corn and mix the ingredients to retain the original flavor. Recipes for homemade kettle corn are available, and microwave popcorn versions are sold.\n\n"}

Agnolotti can be \"di magro\" or \"di grasso\" depending on their filling of vegetables or meat.\n\nAlthough their primitive shape was semi-circular, traditionally agnolotti are of a square shape with sides of about one or two inches. However, they can also be of a smaller, rectangular shape when they are called agnolotti \"al plin\". \"Plin\" means \"a pinch\", because one pinches with thumb and forefinger between each mound of filling to close and seal the little pasta packets. \"Agnolotti\" \"al plin\" are almost always stuffed with meat.\n\nAgnolotti are prepared by immersion in boiling water. Typically, they are dressed with beef broth and a little melted butter or in a fresh sage and melted butter sauce, as a complex sauce would detract from the flavours in the agnolotti pockets. In both cases they may be topped with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, but no cheese is contained within agnolotti. The dish is associated with Piedmont in Italy and is not to be confused with Piacenza's stuffed pasta pockets called \"anolini\".\n\nIn the Monferrato region of Italy, located within Piedmont, a special version of agnolotti is filled with donkey meat.\n\nSimilar recipes without meat (e.g., with a stuffing of ricotta cheese and spinach) are not properly agnolotti but ravioli.\n\n"}
{"id": "2242519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2242519", "title": "Princeton Theology", "text": "Princeton Theology\n\nThe Princeton Theology was a tradition of conservative, Christian, Reformed and Presbyterian theology at Princeton Theological Seminary lasting from the founding of that institution in 1812 until the 1920s, after which, due to the increasing influence of theological liberalism at the school, the last Princeton theologians left to found Westminster Theological Seminary. The appellation has special reference to certain theologians, from Archibald Alexander to B.B. Warfield, and their particular blend of teaching, which together with its Old School Presbyterian Calvinist orthodoxy sought to express a warm Evangelicalism and a high standard of scholarship. W. Andrew Hoffecker argues that they strove to \"maintain a balance between the intellectual and affective elements in the Christian faith.\"\n\nBy extension, the Princeton theologians include those predecessors of Princeton Theological Seminary who prepared the groundwork of that theological tradition, and the successors who tried, and failed, to preserve the seminary against the inroads of a program to better conform that graduate school to \"Broad Evangelicalism\", which was imposed upon it by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.\n\nWilliam Tennent, Sr. of the Log College, Gilbert Tennent and William Tennent, Jr. of the College of New Jersey, and Jonathan Edwards of Princeton University are considered predecessors to the Princeton theologians. Archibald Alexander, Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, and B. B. Warfield were major figures promoting the Princeton Theology. The quarterly journal \"Biblical Repertory\", later renamed the \"Princeton Review\", was an important publication promoting this school. Albert Baldwin Dod, Lyman Hotchkiss Atwater, and John Breckinridge were frequent contributors of this journal. Geerhardus Vos, J. Gresham Machen, Cornelius Van Til, Oswald T. Allis, Robert Dick Wilson, and John Murray were notable successors of the Princeton theologians.\n\nOf these, only Machen and Wilson represented the American Presbyterian tradition that was directly influenced by the Princeton Theology. Vos and Van Til were Dutch Reformed. Murray was a Scot, but a student under Machen at Princeton who later followed him to Westminster Theological Seminary. Murray and Van Til were both ministers in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, which Machen founded.\n\nMark Noll, an evangelical Church historian, sees the \"grand motifs\" of the Princeton Theology as being \nDevotion to the Bible, concern for religious experience, sensitivity to the American experience, and full employment of Presbyterian confessions, seventeenth-century Reformed systematicians, and the Scottish philosophy of Common Sense.\n\nAllegiance to the Bible as the supreme norm was common in the 19th century, and not a distinctive of the Princeton theologians. Princeton was, however, distinguished by the academic rigor with which it approached the Bible. Alexander and his successors sought to defend the doctrines they found in the Bible against rival claims from learned scholars. Charles Hodge saw faithfulness to the Bible as the best defense against higher criticism as well as the overly experiential focus of Friedrich Schleiermacher.\n\nPrinceton theologians saw themselves in the line of Reformed Protestantism stretching back to John Calvin. The dogmatics of Francis Turretin, a Reformed scholastic of the 17th century, was the primary textbook of theology at Princeton. In a world which increasingly valued the new over the old, these theologians preferred the theological systems of the 16th and 17th centuries. The various Reformed confessions were viewed as harmonious voices of a common theological tradition, which was simply a distillation of the teaching of the Bible.\n"}

It is notably a staple food in Egypt, especially in the northern cities of Cairo and Gizah. Ful medames is also a common part of the cuisines of many Arab, Middle Eastern and African cultures, including in Djibouti, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Palestine, Jordan, Israel, Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen, Somalia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome writers have suggested that ful medames dated all the way back to Ancient Egypt.\n\nSome evidence of the use of ful is a cache of 2,600 dried fava beans unearthed at a late Neolithic site on the outskirts of Nazareth.\n\nThis cooking method is mentioned in the Talmud Yerushalmi, indicating that the method was used in Horn of African and Middle Eastern countries since the fourth century. Although there are countless ways of embellishing \"fūl\", the basic recipe remains the same. Once the \"fūl\" is cooked, it is salted and eaten plain or accompanied by olive oil, corn oil, butter, clarified butter, buffalo milk, béchamel sauce, cured beef (basturma), fried or boiled eggs, tomato sauce, garlic sauce, tahini, fresh lemon juice, chili peppers, or other ingredients.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the making of \"fūl\" in Cairo was monopolized by the people living around the Princess Baths, a public bath in a tiny compound near today's public fountain of Muhammad ‘Ali Pasha, a block north of the two elegant minarets of the Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad above the 11th century Bab Zuweila gate. During the day, bath attendants stoked the fires heating the \"qidras\", which are huge pots of bath water. Wood was scarce, so garbage was used as fuel and eventually a dump grew around the baths. When the baths closed, the red embers of the fires continued to burn. To take advantage of these precious fires, huge \"qidras\" were filled with fava beans, and these cauldrons were kept simmering all night, and eventually all day too, in order to provide breakfast for Cairo's population. Cookshops throughout Cairo would send their minions to the Princess Baths to buy their wholesale \"fūl\".\n\nFūl is prepared from the small, round bean known in Egypt as \"fūl ḥammām\" (\"bath beans\"). The beans are cooked until very soft. Other kinds of beans used by Egyptian cooks are \"fūl rūmī\" (\"Roman\", i.e. \"European broad beans\"), large kidney-shaped fava beans, and \"fūl baladī\" (\"country beans\", which are of middling size). \"Fūl nābit\" (or \"nābid\") are fava bean sprouts, \"fūl akhḍar\" (\"green fūl\") are fresh fava beans, and \"fūl madshūsh\" (\"crushed fūl\") are crushed fava beans.\n\nFul medames was exported from Egypt to other parts of the Arab world, as well as other parts of Africa and Asia, but particularly to Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Israel, Yemen, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and Libya.\n\nFul is a popular breakfast dish in Syria, especially Aleppo. The fava beans are left simmering in large copper jars throughout the night, to be served from the next morning on; the beans swim in tahini and olive oil, completed with a hint of red pepper paste (made from Aleppo pepper) over the top.\n\nIn Jordan, ful is made just like hummus in a form of a dip, usually made with tahini, garlic, tomato, lemon juice, ground cumin, olive oil and salt.\n\nFul is a very common dish in Armenia; however, unlike in most Middle Eastern countries, it is there modified with more exclusive and rare spices.\n\nIn Ethiopia (and Eritrea), ful is one of the few dishes not eaten with a pancake-like bread called \"injera\" but is served with standard flour bread. Places serving ful and the accompanying flour bread often provide a communal kitchen for patrons seeking to bake such types of breads since flour bread is not typical in the Ethiopian or Eritrean diet. The beans are topped, or mixed with, a combination of oil and \"berbere\". It is also part of the Somali cuisine, where it is served with Somali's traditional \"laxoox\" (canjeero/injera). \n\nIn Malta, \"ful bit-tewm\" (beans with garlic) is usually associated with fasting during Lent and Good Friday. The beans are soaked in water overnight, cooked in oil with garlic and fresh or dried mint, then dressed with olive oil or vinegar before serving.\n\n\n"}

Compared to regular ice cream, it can be kept at room temperature without melting and is more brittle and rigid but still soft when bitten into. It was developed by Whirlpool Corporation under contract to NASA for the Apollo missions. However, it was never used on any Apollo mission. Freeze-dried foods were developed so that foods could be sent on long-duration spaceflights, as to the Moon, and to reduce the weight of the water and oxygen normally found in food.\n\nFreeze drying (or lyophilization) removes water from the ice cream by lowering the air pressure to a point where ice sublimates from a solid to a gas. The ice cream is placed in a vacuum chamber and frozen until the water crystallizes. The air pressure is lowered, creating a partial vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, sublimating the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a freeze-dried ice cream slice.\n\nFreeze-dried ice cream is sold by mail order and is common in science museums and NASA visitor center gift shops, sometimes accompanied by other freeze-dried foods. They are also for sale in several physical camping stores like REI.\n\nDespite the common use of images of space walking astronauts in shuttle era space suits on packaging, freeze dried ice cream was not included on any Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, or International Space Station missions.

Traditional recipes call for three types of sausage: Morteau sausage or Montbéliard sausage, Strasbourg sausage and Frankfurt sausage. Fatty, inexpensive or salted cuts of pork also often form a part of \"choucroute garnie\", including ham hocks, pork knuckles and shoulders, back bacon and slices of salt pork. Other recipes call for pieces of fish or goose meat, but this is far less typical. \n\nThe cabbage itself is usually heated with a glass of Riesling or other dry white wines or stock, and goose or pork fat. In some recipes, it may also be cooked with chopped onion and sliced apples. Food writer Jeffrey Steingarten attempted to catalogue the composition of an authentic recipe in 1989. He writes that every traditional recipe includes black peppercorns, cloves, garlic, juniper berries, onions, and potatoes; most include bay leaves and wine.\n\nLike \"cassoulet\", \"pot au feu\", and so many other examples of France's regional cuisine, its origin is in a traditional, inexpensive dish, but grand versions (such as \"Choucroute royale\", made with Champagne instead of Riesling), and grand ingredients (such as \"foie gras\" and wild game) are mentioned both in traditional sources (e.g. Ali-Bab) and in recipes from contemporary chefs and restaurants.\n\n\"Choucroute garnie\" is available throughout France in canned or microwavable ready-to-eat form.

Unlike software, cooking recipes aren't copyrightable, so the share-alike/copyleft licensing approach is legally questionable and untested in court.\nAfter the publication the project received an overall positive reception from international press and media for the political message.\n\nThe developers of the beer stated that the beer was primarily a medium for the message of \"\"dogmatic notions of copyright and intellectual property that are dominating our culture\"\", and admitted that the group had only limited experience in beer production and was not made up of beer gurus.\nThe addition of the non-traditional beer ingredient Guaraná was also partly inspired politically by a previously in 2003 initiated Superflex project, \"Guaraná Power\", which focussed on the support of Brazilian guaraná farmers with Fair trade.\n\nAfter the first \"Vores Øl\" brewing of the open-source beer concept, Superflex continued to develop the concept under the name \"Free Beer\". A new colorful, unusual \"Free Beer\" artwork should create associations with the \"\"60's [artistic] liberation\"\" and underline the freedom aspect of the concept. The later name \"Free Beer\" is a play on Richard Stallman's common remark that free software is \"free as in speech, not free as in beer\", who suggested also the creation of \"Free software beer\" instead of an \"open source beer\".\n\nWhile the first \"Vores øl\" recipe draw some technical criticism, the recipe was continuously updated and identified shortcomings got fixed. Originally, the homebrewing community complaint the quality of the process and ingredient description. Remarks were that it was not stated how much water to use in the mash, what type of yeast was to be used, the style of beer being produced (other than being dark and heavy), whether or not any hops were being added for aroma, fermentation temperature, or how the beer was supposed to taste. Making reference to the technical problems of when software instructions (\"source code\") cannot be made into a functioning program, it was mentioned that if this recipe were source code, it would not compile. Because of the underlying theme of the group's message, the correction and development of this recipe is actively encouraged (in software terminology \"bug fixing and patches\").\n\nDue to the availability of the recipe and the many Free Beer brewings of breweries and individuals worldwide over the course of years, the recipe was updated several times. Later major Free Beer recipe iterations (v3.0 and 4.0) were also developed in collaboration with a local Danish and experienced brewery, Skands in Brøndby. As previous recipe shortcomings were corrected, for instance the amount of sugar was decreased by 90%, the quality of the beer improved significantly. The recipe's version, which has now reached 6.0 in 2017, illustrates the community's continuous collaborative improvement progress, made possible by the \"open source\" nature of Free Beer.\n\nUnder its free license, this free beer encourages others to tweak the recipe and redistribute it. Commercial or amateur brewers are able to reuse the recipe. Known derivatives include:\n\nOthers took the political idea of an \"open/free beer\" (not the \"Free Beer\" recipe and label), opened their own beer recipes and/or artwork, often under free licenses:\n\n\nSince its first presentation, the \"Free Beer\" concept was often reported by international printed and online media, and also discussed in specialist books regarding copyright.\n\nThe \"Free Beer\" project was also well received by the FOSS and open content movement, for instance by Richard Stallman, Cory Doctorow, and Lawrence Lessig. It was presented and sold on several technology conferences and meetings, for instance the \"Isummit 2008\" and the RMLL 2011, 2012, and 2014. The FSCONS 2008 resulted also in a CC-BY-SA licensed Ebook with the \"Free Beer\" artwork and title.\nFree Beer was shown also in the context of several art exhibitions and museums, for instance the Art Basel Miami Beach 2006, the Van Abbemuseum, Netherlands 2007 or the Taipei Biennial 2010 (sponsored by TTL). \"Free Beer\" was also used in the context of anti-copyright activities and movements, illustrating the advantage of open knowledge for the society.\n\n\n"}

It is a type of \"tteok\", small rice cakes, traditionally eaten during the Korean autumn harvest festival, Chuseok. It became a popular symbol of traditional Korean culture. The earliest records of songpyeon date from the Goryeo period. \n\nSongpyeon are half-moon shaped rice cakes that contain sweet or semi-sweet fillings, such as sesame seeds and honey, sweet red bean paste or chestnut paste, all steamed over a layer of pine needles, which gives them the fragrant smell of fresh pine trees. The name Songpyeon comes from the use of pine needles (\"song\" in \"songpyeon\" means pine tree).\n\nSongpyeon is made by kneading rice powder with hot water and stuffing the dough with beans, sesame, chestnuts and other fillings. Songpyeon can be made into many unique colors and flavors using natural ingredients. The shape, size and ingredients may vary by region. Common in Seoul are smaller bite-sized songpyeon, while in other regions, such as Gangwon Province, potatoes and acorn powder are more common because Gangwon Province is known for growing these two. Other ingredients that can be added to songpyeon are soybeans, cowpeas, chestnuts, bean powder, jujubes, sesame and honey.\n\nSongpyeon is one of the most popular homemade Korean dishes for holidays. Many families make their own songpyeon. Songpyeon is given to family members and close neighbors as a sign of respect. An old Korean anecdote says that the person who makes beautifully-shaped songpyeon will meet a good spouse or give birth to a beautiful baby. Many Korean families say that Chuseok would not be complete without songpyeon.\n\nSongpyeon was used for ancestral celebrations. Songpyeon and other foods were used to show appreciation for the year's harvest. Koreans hoped and prayed to help them avoid misfortune. Songpyeon is mainly eaten at Chuseok, at harvest time, but some Korean families like to eat them during the spring. \n\nMany stories describe why songpyeon is in the shape of a half moon. Most believe it is because Korean ancestors thought the full moon could only wane while a crescent shape/half-moon would fill up.\n\n\n"}

Despite being plural, \"Teraphim\" may refer to singular objects, using the Hebrew plural of excellence. The word \"Teraphim\" is explained in classical rabbinical literature as meaning \"disgraceful things\" (dismissed by modern etymologists), and in many English translations of the Bible it is translated as \"idols\", or \"household god(s)\", though its exact meaning is more specific than this, but unknown precisely.\n\n\nAccording to Genesis 31, Rachel takes the teraphim belonging to her father Laban when her husband Jacob escapes. She hides them in a saddle bag and sits on them when Laban comes looking for them, and claims that she cannot get up because she is menstruating. From this it can be deduced that they were small, perhaps 30–35 cm. Her exact motive in doing so is subject to controversy amongst the commentators: Some argue she took the teraphim in order that her father not have idolatrous paraphernalia, while others explain that she wanted to use them herself.\n\nIn 1 Samuel 19, Michal helps her husband David to escape from her father Saul. She lets him out through a window, and then tricks Saul's men into thinking that a teraphim in her bed is actually David. This suggests the size and shape is that of a man. It also refers to \"the\" teraphim, which implies that there was a place for teraphim in every household. Van der Toorn claims that \"there is no hint of indignation at the presence of teraphim in David's house.\" However, the same word is used in 1 Samuel 15:23 where Samuel rebukes Saul and tells him that \"presumption is as iniquity and \"teraphim\"\". Here the idea is that rebellion is just as bad as teraphim, the use of which is thus denounced as idolatry. Others explain that the teraphim in this context refer to decorative statues, not to idolatrous ritual items.\n\nThe teraphim were outlawed in Josiah's reform (2 Kings 23:24), but are mentioned again in Hosea 3:4, where it says that \"the Israelites will live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred stones, without ephod or \"teraphim\".\" As in the narrative of Micah's Idol the teraphim is closely associated with the ephod, and both are mentioned elsewhere in connection with divination; it is thus a possibility that the \"Teraphim\" were involved with the process of cleromancy.\n\nIn it states: \"For the teraphim utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; the dreamers tell false dreams, and give empty consolation.\nTherefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for want of a shepherd.\"\n\nJosephus mentions that there was a custom of carrying \"housegods\" on journeys to foreign lands, and it is thus possible that the use of teraphim continued in popular culture well into the Hellenic era and possibly beyond.\n\nAccording to Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, \"Teraphim\" were made from the heads of slaughtered first born male adult humans, shaved, salted, spiced, with a golden plate placed under the tongue, and magic words engraved upon the plate; it was believed that the \"Teraphim\", mounted on the wall, would talk to people. Similarly explanations are cited in the writings of Eleazar of Worms and Tobiah ben Eliezer.\n\nDuring the excavation of Jericho by Kathleen Kenyon, evidence of the use of human skulls as cult objects was uncovered, lending credence to the Rabbinical conjecture. The implied size and the fact that Michal could pretend that one was David, has led to the Rabbinical conjecture that they were heads, possibly mummified human heads.\n\nCasper Labuschagne claims that it comes via metathesis from the root פתר, \"to interpret\". Karel Van der Toorn argues that they were ancestor figurines rather than household deities, and that the \"current interpretation of the teraphim as household deities suffers from a onesided use of Mesopotamian material.\"\n\nThat Micah, who worshipped Yahweh, used the \"Teraphim\" as an idol, and that Laban regarded the Teraphim as representing \"his gods\", is thought to indicate that they were evidently images of Yahweh. It is considered possible that they originated as a fetish, possibly initially representative of ancestors, but gradually becoming oracular.\n\nBenno Landsberger and later Harry Hoffner derive the word from Hittite \"tarpiš\", \"the evil daemon\".\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally filled with seasoned ground beef, but fillings can include chicken, pork, lamb, vegetables, shrimp, lobster, fish, soy, ackee, mixed vegetables or cheese. In Jamaica, the patty is often eaten as a full meal, especially when paired with coco bread. It can also be made as bite-sized portions called cocktail patties. Among the Jamaican diaspora in the UK, the pastry is more like that of a suet crust, and often made with margarine or butter, which provides the flaky pastry, and curry powder containing turmeric, which provides the yellow colour.\n\nThe beef patty is a product of colonialism and migration developed after the introduction of the Cornish pasty in the Caribbean, mixed with cumin and curry seasonings of Indian indentured servants in Jamaica and cayenne pepper from African slaves. \"The firecracker taste of the Scotch bonnet, a hot pepper indigenous to Jamaica, sealed the flavour.\"\n\nJamaicans brought recipes for the patties northward in the 1960s and 1970s when many went to the United States as hospital orderlies, home health aides and nurses.

Although it may also be loosely defined as any approach against the Modern Defense involving an early Bc4 and Qf3, threatening \"Scholar's mate\", it is strictly defined by the sequence of moves:\n\nThe Monkey's Bum Deferred is a more respected variation in which White develops his queen's knight before playing Bc4 and Qf3.\nThe Monkey's Bum was discovered and championed by IM Nigel Povah in the 1970s during a wave of popularity for the Modern Defence. In 1972, after Keene and Botterill published their book \"The Modern Defence\", Povah began looking for a response to the opening. He happened across the game Ljubojević–Keene, Palma de Mallorca 1971, which started 1.e4 g6 2.d4 d6 3.Bc4 Bg7 4.f4 Nf6 and eventually ended in a draw. Intrigued by Ljubojević's early Bc4, Povah began investigating a rapid assault on f7 with 3.Qf3. When he showed the first few moves to Ken Coates, a friend at Leeds, Coates declared, \"If that works then I'm a monkey's bum!\" The name stuck. The Monkey's Bum first appeared in print five years later in the \"British Chess Magazine\". Povah wrote an article on the theory of the Monkey's Bum, in which he stated that although he had never yet lost with the variation, it was still \"in its infancy\".\n\nIn playing the Monkey's Bum, White's idea is to gain active piece play by a sacrifice of the d4-pawn, much like the Smith-Morra Gambit. In practice however, such compensation proves tenuous in the Monkey's Bum proper, as evidenced by the following game:\n\nA much more popular and respected approach against the Modern Defense is the Monkey's Bum Deferred. It has been employed by such notable grandmasters as John Nunn, Sergei Rublevsky and Judit Polgár. It is distinct from the Monkey's Bum proper in that the attempt to create the \"Scholar's mate\" threat with Bc4 and Qf3 only occurs after White has developed his queen's knight. A typical sequence of the Monkey's Bum Deferred is 1.e4 g6 2.d4 Bg7 3.Nc3 c6 4.Bc4 d6 5.Qf3 (see diagram). Usually White will castle kingside and undertake an attack by means of the pawn thrust f2–f4.\n\nThe following spectacular game is probably the most famous success of the Monkey's Bum Deferred and forced it to be considered with respect by the chess world:\n\n\n"}

It is also an important Buddhist concept referring to \"attachment, clinging, grasping\". It is considered to be the result of \"taṇhā\" (craving), and is part of the \"dukkha\" (suffering, pain) doctrine in Buddhism.\n\nUpādāna is the Sanskrit and Pāli word for \"clinging\", \"attachment\" or \"grasping\", although the literal meaning is \"fuel\". Upādāna and taṇhā (Skt. \"tṛṣṇā\") are seen as the two primary causes of suffering. The cessation of clinging leads to Nirvana.\n\nIn the Sutta Pitaka, the Buddha states that there are four types of clinging:\nThe Buddha once stated that, while other sects might provide an appropriate analysis of the first three types of clinging, he alone fully elucidated clinging to the \"self\" and its resultant suffering.\n\nThe Abhidhamma and its commentaries provide the following definitions for these four clinging types:\nAccording to Buddhaghosa, the above ordering of the four types of clinging is in terms of decreasing \"grossness\", that is, from the most obvious (grossest) type of clinging (sense-pleasure clinging) to the subtlest (self-doctrine clinging).\n\nBuddhaghosa further identifies that these four clinging types are causally interconnected as follows:\nThis hierarchy of clinging types is represented diagrammatically to the right.\n\nThus, based on Buddhaghosa's analysis, clinging is more fundamentally an erroneous core belief (self-doctrine clinging) than a habitualized affective experience (sense-pleasure clinging).\n\nIn terms of consciously knowable mental experiences, the Abhidhamma identifies sense-pleasure clinging with the mental factor of \"greed\" (\"lobha\") and the other three types of clinging (self-doctrine, wrong-view and rites-and-rituals clinging) with the mental factor of \"wrong view\" (\"ditthi\"). Thus, experientially, clinging can be known through the Abhidhamma's fourfold definitions of these mental factors as indicated in the following table:\n\nTo distinguish craving from clinging, Buddhaghosa uses the following metaphor:\nThus, for instance, when the Buddha talks about the \"aggregates of clinging,\" he is referring to our grasping and guarding physical, mental and conscious experiences that we falsely believe we are or possess.\n\nIn the Four Noble Truths, the First Noble Truth identifies clinging (\"upādāna\", in terms of \"the aggregates of clinging\") as one of the core experiences of suffering. The Second Noble Truth identifies craving (\"tanha\") as the basis for suffering. In this manner a causal relationship between craving and clinging is found in the Buddha's most fundamental teaching.\n\nIn the twelve-linked chain of Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda, \"also see\" Twelve Nidanas), clinging (\"upādāna\") is the ninth causal link:\n\n\n\nAccording to Buddhaghosa, it is \"sense-pleasure\" clinging that arises from craving and that conditions becoming.\n\nProfessor Richard F. Gombrich has pointed out in several publications, and in his recent Numata Visiting Professor Lectures at the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), that the literal meaning of \"upādāna\" is \"fuel\". He uses this to link the term to the Buddha's use of fire as a metaphor. In the so-called Fire Sermon (\"Āditta-pariyāya\") (Vin I, 34-5; SN 35.28) the Buddha tells the bhikkhus that everything is on fire. By everything he tells them he means the five senses plus the mind, their objects, and the operations and feelings they give rise to — i.e. everything means the totality of experience. All these are burning with the fires of greed, hatred and delusion.\n\nIn the nidana chain, then, craving creates \"fuel\" for continued burning or becoming (bhava). The mind like fire, seeks out more fuel to sustain it, in the case of the mind this is \"sense experience\", hence the emphasis the Buddha places on \"guarding the gates of the senses\". By not being caught up in the senses (\"appamāda\") we can be liberated from greed, hatred and delusion. This liberation is also expressed using the fire metaphor when it is termed \"nibbāna\" (Sanskrit: \"\") which means to \"go out\", or literally to \"blow out\". (Regarding the word \", the verb \"vā\" is intransitive so no agent is required.)\n\nProbably by the time the canon was written down (1st Century BCE), and certainly when Buddhaghosa was writing his commentaries (4th Century CE) the sense of the metaphor appears to have been lost, and \"upādāna\" comes to mean simply \"clinging\" as above. By the time of the Mahayana the term \"fire\" was dropped altogether and greed, hatred and delusion are known as the \"three poisons\".\n\nThe term \"Upādāna\" appears in the sense of \"material cause\" in ancient Vedic and medieval Hindu texts. For medieval era Vaishnavism scholar Ramanuja, the metaphysical Hindu concept of Brahman (as Vishnu) is the \"upadana-karana\" (material cause) of the universe. However, other Hindu traditions such as the Advaita Vedanta disagree and assert alternate theories on the nature of metaphysical Brahman and the universe while using the term \"upadana\" in the sense of \"substrate, fuel\".\n\nMore generally, the realist Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya and Nyaya have asserted that Brahman is the \"Upādāna\" of the phenomenal world. The philosophies within the Buddhist schools have denied Brahman, asserted impermanence and that the notion of anything real is untenable from a metaphysical sense. The Hindu traditions such as those influenced by Advaita Vedanta have asserted the position that everything (Atman, Brahman, Prakriti) is ultimately one identical reality. The concept \"Upādāna\" also appears with other sense of meanings, in Vedanta philosophies, such as \"taking in\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2263731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2263731", "title": "Mawla", "text": "Mawla\n\nMawlā (), plural mawālī (), is a polysemous Arabic word, whose meaning varied in different periods and contexts. In the Quran and hadith it is used in two senses: Lord; and guardian, trustee, helper. In the pre-Islamic era the term originally applied to any form of tribal association. During the early Islamic era, this institution was adapted to incorporate new converts to Islam into the Arab-Muslim society and the word \"mawali\" gained currency as an appellation for non-Arab Muslims.\n\nThe word \"mawla\" is derived from the root \"w-l-y\", meaning \"to be close to\", \"to be friends with\", or \"to have power over\". \"Mawla\" can have reciprocal meanings, depending on whether it is used in the active or passive voice: \"master\" or \"slave/freedman\", \"patron\" or \"client\", \"uncle\" or \"nephew\", or simply friend. Originally, \"mawāli\" were clients of an Arab tribe, but with the advent of Islam, the term came to refer to non-Arab Muslims and other client allies of the Muslim community.\n\nThe term originated in pre-Islamic society to refer to a politically-active class of slaves and freedmen, but it gained prominence during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 750-1258 CE/132-656 AH), as many non-Arabs mainly Persian subjects and later Turkic Abbasid slaves converted to Islam. The influx of non-Arab converts to Islam created a new difficulty in incorporating them into tribal Arab society. The solution appeared to be the creation of a contract, a wala', through which the non-Arab Muslims acquired an Arab patron (mawla). They continued to pay a similar tax that was required from the people of the book and were generally excluded from government and the military until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. In Khorasan and Persia, the Arabs held most of the higher positions in the armed forces and in the upper echelons of government.\n\nThe Abbasid Revolution in 750 CE challenged the political and social privileges held so far by the Arabs. The key figure in this revolution was Abu Muslim Khorasani. He was a Persian, born in Isfahan and therefore had impeccable credentials of birth with the exploited Persian majority. The legacy of Umayyad excesses had created extreme bitterness among the local population. Unfair taxation had fostered dislike of the Arabs among the Persians. Under the Abbasid rulers of the 9th century, the non-Arab converts comprised an important part of the army. The institution of wala' as a requirement to enter Muslim society ceased to exist but acquired political significance with the formation of troops entirely composed of mainly-Turkic freedmen in the service of the caliph, a practice that persisted through the Ottoman period. Together, the rise to power of those ethnic groups restricted the power of the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad.\n\nAbu Hanifa was the founder of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence within Sunni Islam and lived through the Abbasid Revolution. He famously stated in one of his dictums: “The belief of a newly converted Turk is the same as that of an Arab from Hejaz”.

The supporting tissues are known as the periodontium, which includes the gingiva (gums), alveolar bone, cementum, and the periodontal ligament. A person who practices this specialty is known as a periodontist.\n\nPeriodontal diseases take on many different forms but are usually a result of a coalescence of bacterial plaque biofilm accumulation of the red complex bacteria (e.g., P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola) of the gingiva and teeth, combined with host immuno-inflammatory mechanisms and other risk factors that can lead to destruction of the supporting bone around natural teeth. Untreated, these diseases can lead to alveolar bone loss and tooth loss. , Periodontal disease accounted for 70.8% of teeth lost in patients with the disease in Korea. Periodontal disease is the second most common cause of tooth loss (second to dental caries) in Scotland. Twice daily brushing and flossing are a way to help prevent periodontal diseases.\n\nPeriodontology also involves the placement and maintenance of dental implants, including the treatment of peri-implantitis (inflammatory bone loss around dental implants). The etiology of peri-implantitis is thought to be very similar to periodontal disease.\n\nBefore applying to any postgraduate training program in periodontology, one must first complete a dental degree.\n\nAlthough each European country has its own independent system, an umbrella organisation—the European Federation of Periodontology (EFP)—has the ability to accredit post-graduate programs according to specific guidelines. The EFP awards a certificate of specialized training in periodontology, periodontics and implant dentistry to every successful European candidates after 3 years of full-time training in an accredited post-graduate program. The EFP organizes bi-annual meetings around Europe under the title EuroPerio where many thousands of dentists attend the sessions featuring over 100 of the worlds top perio speakers. The graduate programs that have been approved are the following: , University of Bern, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Institute for Postgraduate Dental Education Jönköping, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University of Louvain (UCLouvain), University Complutense in Madrid, University of Dublin, Trinity College, University of Strasbourg in France, Paris Diderot University at Rothschild hospital.\n\nAustralian programs are accredited by the Australian Dental Council (ADC) and are 3 years in length and culminate with either a Master's degree (MDS) or a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry degree (DClinDent). Fellowship can then be obtained with the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons, FRACDS (Perio).\n\nCanadian programs are accredited by the CDAC and are a minimum of three years in length and usually culminate with a master (MSc or MDent) degree. Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Fellowship exams with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada (FRCD(C)). Dentistry is a regulated profession. To become a licensed dentist in Canada you must have a BDS/DDS/DMD degree and be certified by the NDEB. To further specialise into periodontics, accredited dentists are required to undertake a specialty core knowledge examination and complete a postgraduate degree.\n\nPeriodontics is offered as a specialization field of dentistry in India. Periodontists attend a Master of Dental Surgery (M.D.S.) program affiliated with dental schools in India. The minimum qualification required for the M.D.S. degree is a Bachelor of Dental Surgery. A majority of dental schools in India offer M.D.S. degrees specializing in Periodontology. The course is three years duration and students are trained for implantology as well as diagnosis and treatment of peri implant diseases along with Periodontology.\n\nThe British Society of Periodontology exists to promote the art and science of periodontology. Their membership includes specialist practitioners, periodontists, general dentists, consultants and trainees in restorative dentistry, clinical academics, dental hygienists and therapists, specialist trainees in periodontology and many others.\n\nSpecialist training in periodontics in the UK is either a three-year full-time or four years at three days per week. At the end of the training, candidates are awarded a Master of Clinical Dentistry (MClinDent) before being entered on the specialist list held by the General Dental Council.\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) accredited programs are a minimum of three years in length. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, U.S.-trained periodontists are specialists in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases and oral inflammation, and in the placement and maintenance of dental implants. Many periodontists also diagnose and treat oral pathology. Historically, periodontics served as the basis for the specialty of oral medicine. Following successful completion of post-graduate training a periodontist becomes Board eligible for the American Board of Periodontology examination. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomate status in the American Board of Periodontology.\n\n\n"}

It is not a type of mutation, as it is non-hereditary.\n\nThe term was coined by Richard Goldschmidt in 1935. He used it to refer to forms, produced by some experimental procedure, whose appearance duplicates or copies the phenotype of some mutant or combination of mutants.\n\nThe butterfly genus \"Vanessa\" can change phenotype based on the local temperature. If introduced to Lapland they mimic butterflies localised to this area; and if localised to Syria they mimic butterflies of this area.\n\nThe larvae of \"Drosophila melanogaster\" have been found to be particularly vulnerable to environmental factors which produce phenocopies of known mutations; these factors include temperature, shock, radiation, and various chemical compounds. In fruit fly, \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the normal body colour is brownish gray with black margins. A hereditary mutant for this was discovered by T.H. Morgan in 1910 where the body colour is yellow. This was a genotypic character which was constant in both the flies in all environments. However, in 1939, Rapport discovered that if larvae of normal flies were fed with silver salts, they develop into yellow bodied flies irrespective of their genotype. The yellow bodied flies which are genetically brown is a variant of the original yellow bodied fly.\n\nPhenocopy can also be observed in Himalayan rabbits. When raised in moderate temperatures, Himalayan rabbits are white in colour with black tail, nose, and ears, making them phenotypically distinguishable from genetically black rabbits. However, when raised in cold temperatures, Himalayan rabbits show black colouration of their coats, resembling the genetically black rabbits. Hence this Himalayan rabbit is a phenocopy of the genetically black rabbit.\n\nReversible and/or cosmetic modifications such as the use of hair bleach are not considered to be phenocopy, as they are not inherent traits.\n\n"}

It is a comparatively recent word coined inadvertently in the seventeenth century by the Welsh lexicographer Dr John Davies (Mallwyd).\n\nAccording to folklorist Wirt Sikes the gwyllion are female fairies of frightful aspect who haunt lonely roads in the Welsh mountains and lead travellers astray. They are gloomy spirits more akin to hags or witches, as distinct from the Welsh ellyllon (elves) that are more benevolent. Those who encountered them either by night or on a misty day would be sure to lose their way even if they were perfectly familiar with the road. One gwyll in particular was known as the Old Woman of the Mountain who haunted Llanhyddel Mountain in Monmouthshire, and the popular tradition in that district was that she was the ghost of a woman who had been regarded in life as a witch. She is known to utter strange cries and shouts throughout her mountain in order to frighten wayfarers.\n\nThe Old Woman has also been encountered on Black Mountain in Breconshire. One man reported meeting her there and at the same time found that he had lost his way. Thinking she was human he called out for her to stay but receiving no answer he thought she was deaf. He tried to overtake her but she led him further astray, always out of reach, until he found himself in a marsh. When she uttered a cackling laugh he suspected she might be a gwyll so he drew his knife, whereupon the Old Woman vanished. His suspicions were confirmed for it was well known that Welsh ghosts and fairies were afraid of knives and could be banished by them.\n\nThis exorcism by knife, according to Sikes, is a particularly Welsh tradition. The gwyllion often came into the houses of the people at the parish of Aberystruth, especially in stormy weather. She was always made welcome, not out of any sense of friendship but out of fear of what she might do to them if she were offended. She was provided with clean water and care was taken that no knife or any other cutting tool should be in the corner near the fire where the fairies liked to sit. While it was desirable to exorcise them when in the open air it was not prudent to display an inhospitable attitude towards any member of the fairy realm.\n\nAnother traveller encountered the gwyllion at night on Bedwellty Mountain. There were several such spirits dancing fantastically around him. He also heard the sounds of a bugle-horn and what seemed like invisible hunters riding by. Although he was afraid he drew his knife and the fairies vanished. Sikes speculates that if these ideas are traced back to their source then they may have some connection with the sword Excalibur and the role it plays in the primeval world. The folklorist Katharine Briggs suggested that it may have to do with the traditional fairy vulnerability to cold iron.\n\nThe Gwyllion is featured as the main antagonist in the 2013 CGI animated film \"\". She appears as a vengeful old woman with light grey hair who attacked the crystal fairies.\n\n\n"}

A swagger stick is shorter than a staff or cane, and is usually made from rattan. Its use derives from the vine staff carried by Roman centurions as an emblem of office.\n\nIn the British Army before World War I, swagger sticks were carried by all other ranks when off duty, as part of their walking out uniform. The stick took the form of a short cane of polished wood, with an ornamented metal head of regimental pattern. The usual custom was for the private soldier or NCO to carry the stick tucked under his arm. Cavalrymen carried a small riding cane instead of the swagger stick of infantry and other branches. This practice was restricted to the army and Royal Marines, and was never imitated by the other services, although T.E. Lawrence when he had enlisted in the Royal Air Force under the name of Ross, mentions that airmen under training at the RAF Depot at Uxbridge carried swagger sticks. It is thought that this practice was limited to the Depot.\n\nUntil 1939 swagger sticks were still carried by peacetime regular soldiers when \"walking out\" of barracks but the practice ceased with the outbreak of World War II. Uniforms are no longer worn by British army personnel when off-duty and the swagger stick has accordingly become obsolete.\n\nIn the British Army and other military forces following the Commonwealth traditions, commissioned officers of most infantry regiments formerly carried swagger sticks (described as canes) when on duty, whilst Warrant Officers and Senior NCOs carried pace sticks instead. This practice continues in some regiments, especially by Warrant Officers when in Barrack Dress. Cavalry officers would often carry a riding crop rather than a swagger stick, in deference to their mounted traditions. In some Irish regiments in the British army, such as the Irish Guards, officers carried a blackthorn walking stick, based on the shillelagh. In the Royal Tank Regiment, officers carried an 'ash plant' or walking stick instead, in reference to World War I tank attacks, when officers would prepare lines of advance by testing the ground's firmness and suitability for tanks.\n\nSwagger sticks were once in vogue in the United States Marine Corps, starting as an informal accessory carried by officers in the late 19th century. In 1915, it gained official approval as recruiters were encouraged to carry them to improve their public image. This tradition grew when Marines deployed for World War I encountered European officers carrying swagger sticks, leading to an entry in the uniform regulations in 1922 authorizing enlisted Marines to carry them as well. The usage died down in the 1930s and 40s, with the exception of China Marines, and came back into vogue with a 1952 regulation encouraging them, reaching a peak from 1956 to 1960 when on 4 January 1960, the Commandant, General David M. Shoup, commented on their use with regard to Uniforms and Equipment.\nThere is one item of equipment about which I have a definite opinion. It is the swagger stick. It shall remain an optional item of interference. If you feel the need of it, carry it…\n\nFew, if any, contemporary officers carry a swagger stick, and it has no official sanction in any branch.\n\nGeneral George S. Patton carried a swagger stick throughout World War II; however, his contained a concealed blade, similar to a Victorian gentleman's sword cane.\n\nGeneral William J. Livsey, who was the Commanding General of the Eighth United States Army in South Korea from 1984 to 1987 publicly carried a swagger stick that was carved from wood collected at the Korean Demilitarized Zone Axe Murder Incident poplar tree.\n\n\n"}

The name, which is translated as \"little orange\", derives from their shape and colour which, after cooking, is reminiscent of an orange. 'Arancini al ragù' produced in eastern Sicily have a conical shape representing the volcano Etna.\n\nArancini are said to have originated in 10th-century Sicily at a time when the island was under Arab rule.\n\nIn the cities of Palermo, Siracusa, and Trapani in Sicily, arancini are a traditional food for the feast of Santa Lucia on 13 December when bread and pasta are not eaten. This commemorates arrival of a grain supply ship on Santa Lucia's day in 1646, relieving a severe famine.\n\nToday, with the increasing popularity of this finger food in modern Italian food culture, arancini are found all year round at most Sicilian food outlets, particularly in Palermo, Messina and Catania. The dish was traditionally created to provide a full meal to Federico II di Svevia during his hunting activities.\n\nThe most common type of \"arancini\" sold in Sicilian cafés are \"arancini al ragù\", which typically consist of meat in a tomato sauce, rice, and mozzarella or other cheese. Many cafés also offer \"arancini al burro\" (with butter or béchamel sauce) or specialty arancini, such as \"arancini con funghi\" (mushrooms), \"con pistacchi\" (pistachios), or \"con melanzane\" (aubergine).\n\nIn Roman cuisine, \"supplì\" are similar but are commonly filled with cheese (different preparation methods and filling distribution). In Naples, rice balls are called \"pall'e riso\". In a variant recipe originating among the Italian diaspora in Southeast Texas, the arancini are stuffed with a chili-seasoned filling.\n\nIn Italian literature, Inspector Montalbano, the main character of Andrea Camilleri's detective novels, is a well-known lover of arancini.

In Gascony, according to the families perpetuating the tradition of duck confit, all the pieces of duck are used to produce the meal. Each part can have a specific destination in traditional cooking, the neck being used for example in an invigorating soup, the garbure. Duck confit is considered one of the finest French dishes. \n\nWhile it is made across France, it is seen as a specialty of Gascony. The confit is prepared in a centuries-old process of preservation that consists of salt curing a piece of meat (generally goose, duck, or pork) and then cooking it in its own fat.\n\nTo prepare a confit, the meat is rubbed with salt, garlic, and sometimes herbs such as thyme, then covered and refrigerated for up to 36 hours. Salt-curing the meat acts as a preservative.\n\nPrior to cooking, the spices are rinsed from the meat, which is then patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the rendered fat, and placed in an oven at a low temperature (76 – 135 degrees Celsius/170 – 275 Fahrenheit). The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, generally four to ten hours.\n\nThe meat and fat are then removed from the oven and left to cool. When cool, the meat can be transferred to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept in the refrigerator for up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.\n\nConfit is also sold in cans, which can be kept for several years. The flavourful fat from the confit may also be used in many other ways, as a frying medium for sautéed vegetables (e.g., green beans and garlic, wild or cultivated mushrooms), savory toasts, scrambled eggs or omelettes, and as an addition to shortcrust pastry for tarts and quiches.\n\nA classic recipe is to fry or grill the legs in a bit of the fat until they are well-browned and crisp, and use more of the fat to roast some potatoes and garlic as an accompaniment.\nThe potatoes roasted in duck fat to accompany the crisped-up confit is called \"pommes de terre à la sarladaise\". Another accompaniment is red cabbage slow-braised with apples and red wine.\n\nDuck confit is also a traditional ingredient in many versions of cassoulet.\n\n\n"}

It is implied that they may also be indestructible. Factory owner Willy Wonka explained that they were \"for children with very little pocket money\".\n\nAlthough only briefly mentioned in the book and its 2005 film adaptation, the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" used the Everlasting Gobstopper as a plot device in which Wonka's business rival Slugworth attempts to bribe the children visiting the Wonka factory to steal one for him. This is later revealed as a lie; Slugworth is actually Mr. Wilkinson, one of Wonka's workers. The proposal is a test Wonka set up to judge the worthiness of the ticket holders to take over the factory, given to all five children.\n\nThe actual Everlasting Gobstopper prop used in the Gene Wilder movie was sold for $100,000 to the owners of TV show \"Pawn Stars\".\n\nA product called Everlasting Gobstopper was introduced in 1976 by the Chicago candy company Breaker Confections.

The Willy Wonka Candy Company brand was later bought by Nestlé and production has been moved to Itasca, Illinois.\n\nThe everlasting gobstopper is similar to a normal gobstopper or jawbreaker and is composed of several discrete layers.

{"id": "2281834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281834", "title": "New Mexican cuisine", "text": "New Mexican cuisine\n\nNew Mexican cuisine is the cuisine of the Southwestern US state of New Mexico, the region is primarily known for its fusion of Pueblo Native American with Hispano Spanish and Mexican cuisine originating in Nuevo México. This cuisine had adaptions and influences throughout its history, including early on from the nearby Apache, Navajo, and throughout New Spain and the Spanish Empire, also from French, Italian, Mediterranean, Portuguese cuisine, and European cafés, furthermore during the American territorial phase from cowboy chuckwagons and Western saloons, additionally after statehood from Route 66 American diners, fast food restaurants, and global cuisine. Even so, New Mexican cuisine developed in fairly isolated circumstances, which has allowed it to maintain its indigenous, Spanish, and Mexican identity, and is therefore not like any other Latin food originating in the contiguous United States.\n\nIt can be easily distinguished from other Mexican and American cuisines, due to its emphasis on New Mexican spices, herbs, and flavors; especially red and/or green New Mexico chile peppers, anise (used in bizcochitos), and piñon (used as a snack or in desserts). It is also identifiable by the presence of foods and dishes that originate in New Mexico, such as; Native American frybread-style sopapillas, breakfast burritos, enchilada montada (stacked enchiladas), green chile stew, carne adovada (pork marinated in red chile), carne seca (a thinly sliced variant of jerky), green chile burgers, posolé (a hominy dish), slow cooked frijoles/beans (typically pinto beans), and calabacitas (a sautéed zucchini and summer squash dish).\n\nPrior to the establishment of New Mexico's current boundaries, Santa Fe de Nuevo México's land claim encompassed the Pueblo peoples and also oversaw the land of the Chiricahua, Comanche, Mescalero, and Navajo. The Spaniards brought their cuisine which mingled with the indigenous. They introduced, wheat, rice, beef, mutton/lamb, among other foods and flavors, to the native corn, chile, beans, squash, and other native delights. During this early development period the Horno, an outdoor beehive-shaped earth oven, became ubiquitous in Pueblo and Hispano communities.\n\nThis distinct history—combined with the local terrain and climate—has resulted in significant differences between the cuisine of New Mexico and somewhat similar styles in Northern Mexico, and other Southwestern US states such as California, Arizona, and Texas.\n\nMany residents in the north and the capital, Santa Fe, are descended from Spanish noblemen and explorers who came in the 16th century. Nuevo México also took part in the Mexican revolution and the development of early Mexican culture. \"Anglos\" and African Americans traded and settled after the Civil War.\n\nNew Mexico's population includes Native Americans who have been on the land thousands of years. Most recently, Asian and Indochinese immigrants have discovered New Mexico.\n\nWhen New Mexicans refer to chile they are talking about pungent pods, or sauce made from those pods, not the concoction of spices, meat or beans known as Texas chili con carne. While chile, the pod, is sometimes spelled chili, chilli, or chillie elsewhere, US Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico made this state's spelling official in a sense, by entering it into the \"Congressional Record\".\n\nOne of the first authors to publish a cookbook describing traditional New Mexican cuisine was educator and writer Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert, who published \"Historic Cookery\" in 1931. Her work helped introduce cooking with chiles to the United States more broadly.\n\nNew Mexico chile is the defining ingredient of New Mexican food. Chile is New Mexico's largest agricultural crop. Within New Mexico, green chile is also popular in non-New Mexican cuisines including Mexican-style food and American food like cheeseburgers, french fries, bagels, and pizza. The New Mexico official State Question is \"Red or green?\" This refers to the choice of red or green chile with an entrée. \"Christmas,\" a relatively new tradition, is a request for both (one side covered with green, the other with red) New Mexico red and green chile have such a rich and distinctive flavor that traditional preparations require few additional flavoring ingredients. The essence of New Mexico chile preparation is its simplicity.\n\nThe New Mexico green chile is a variety of the chile pepper, \"Capsicum annuum\", and was developed as a recognizable strain in New Mexico by the late nineteenth century. It is available today in several distinct and selectively-cultivated strains called cultivars. The chile pepper is grown in the state's very high altitude (4,000–8,000 ft) and dry, hot climate. Much like grapes for wine, these growing conditions contribute, along with genetics, to giving New Mexico green chile its distinctive deep green color, texture, and flavor. The climate of New Mexico tends to increase the capsaicin levels in the chile pod compared to pods grown in other regions. This results in the possibility of hotter varieties. New Mexico green chiles can range from mild to extremely hot. At harvest time (August through the middle of October) green chile is typically roasted, peeled and frozen for the year ahead. Chile is such a staple in New Mexico that many national restaurant chains offer New Mexico chile at their New Mexico locations.\n\nNew Mexico red chile is simply the fully ripened green chile pepper. As it ripens, it first turns orange and then quickly turns red. As it does so, the skin thickens and fuses to the inner fruit or \"meat\" of the pepper. This means that, for the red pepper to be enjoyable, it must first be dried then blended into a puree. The puree can be made using full red chile pods or red chile powder (which is made by finely grinding the dried pod). The purée is not edible until cooked as \"red chile sauce\". This is made by cooking the puree with garlic, salt – and occasionally oregano – and has the consistency of tomato soup. Discerning native New Mexicans prefer sun-dried over oven-dried red chile, as the oven-drying process gives it a non-traditional smoky flavor and a dark maroon color. Red chile peppers are traditionally sun-dried in bundles called , which are a common decorative sight on porches and in homes and businesses throughout the Southwest. The process of creating the ristra is highly labor-intensive, so the ristra in recent decades has become a predominantly decorative item.\n\nThe bulk of New Mexico chile is grown in the Hatch Valley in the south of the state, in and around the village of Hatch. It is also grown along the entire Rio Grande Valley, and Chimayo in the north is also well known for its chile.\n\nPiñones, or piñon nuts, are a traditional food of Native Americans and Hispanos in New Mexico that is harvested from the ubiquitous piñon pine tree. The state of New Mexico protects the use of the word \"piñon\" for use with pine nuts from certain species of indigenous New Mexican pines.\n\nWheat flour tortillas are more prevalent in New Mexico cuisine as a table bread than corn tortillas. However, corn tortillas, corn tortilla chips, and masa are the foundations of many traditional New Mexico dishes, and sometimes made of blue corn. Common traditional dishes include enchiladas, tacos, posole, tamales, and sopaipillas as a dessert. However Corn (maize) remains a staple grain, the yellow sweet corn variety is most common in New Mexico, though white is sometimes used, and blue and red flint corn varieties are used for specialties like and blue-corn tortilla chips. Kernel corn and corn on the cob are frequent side dishes, as in the rest of the American South. Corn is not a frequent component of New Mexico or , and is usually a separate side dish in and of itself.\n\nAnise is common in some desserts, especially the state cookie, the bizcochito. Cilantro, a pungent green herb (also called Mexican or Chinese parsley, the seeds of which are known as coriander) used fresh in salsas, and as a topping for virtually any dish; not common in traditional New Mexican cuisine, but one of the defining tastes of Santa Fe style. Cumin, the quintessential \"Mexican food\" spice, is used very differently in New Mexican food, usually reserved for spicing ground beef and sometimes other meats for burritos, tacos, and nachos. It is not used to flavor red and green chile sauces. Oregano is a sparingly used but common spice used in traditional New Mexican dishes.\n\nThe early Spanish Colonies along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico used Safflower as a substitute for Saffron in traditional recipes. An heirloom variety originating from Corrales, New Mexico called \"Corrales Azafran\" is still cultivated and used as a saffron substitute in New Mexican cuisine.\n\n\n\nThere have been several restaurants and restaurant chains serving New Mexican cuisine.\n\n"}

Variations represent popular national dishes in the Canary Islands, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Dominican Republic, and Venezuela and stews such as the Corsica, Irish, Danish, German and Italian versions, plus bouillon in Haiti, and pot au feu in France. It usually consists of large pieces of meat, tubers and vegetables served in a broth.\n\nIn the Canary Islands, the dish is usually made with fish that is cooked whole. \n\nIn Puerto Rico, sancocho is considered a fairly rustic dish. It is made with chicken and smoked ham (Sancocho de gallina), top round beef (sancocho), pork feet with chick peas (sancocho de patitas), or beef short ribs with chorizo. There are several versions and every household has their own take on sancocho, but a true Puerto Rican sancocho always calls for corn on the cob, a variety of tubers, guineos, sofrito, and sazón. Other vegetables and flavoring can include celery, carrots, ginger, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, orégano, wine, and rum. The hearty stew is served with a small bowl of rice, pique criollo, tostones, and bread.\n\nIn Venezuela, sancochos are prepared throughout the country, recognized as a typical meal of the weekend. The stew can be beef (usually in the Llanos region), chicken (usually central and western region), beef stomach and shank (simply called \"tripe\") or goat (here called \"goat tripe\", typical of western Falcón and Lara states) and fish or seafood (usually East and Caribbean coast). When mixing two types of meat (chicken and beef, etc.) is called crossover or \"cruzado\". Among vegetables and traditional spices for all varieties are yam, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, potato, cassava, jojoto (maize/corn), celery (celeriac), taro (mafafa/malanga), pumpkin (squash), cabbage, Chinese taro or Chirel hot pepper, cilantro, and green or topocho banana.\n\nThese soups are major Venezuelan cuisine dishes that are not usually accompanied by other foods. Consumed at lunchtime or in the evening, the stew is a common dish at celebrations, usually served during or after meals — the latter, according to popular belief, to relieve hangover. For this reason, it is typical to serve this dish for lunch on Christmas or New Year's Day.\n\nIt is usually served with cassava or with arepas. Some people add lemon juice (especially fish). There are variants of the same, as the \"cruzado\" and the three-phase, when three types of meat are combined. Undeniably, the popularity of this dish is seen at celebrations: Instead of saying you are going to a party, it is common to \"go to a sancocho.\" Colloquially, it is often simply called \"soup\". In some regions (as in Zulia state) it is given the name sopón.\n\nSancocho is a traditional food in Colombia made with many kinds of meat (most commonly chicken, hen, pork ribs, cow ribs, fish, and ox tail) with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables such as tomato, scallion, cilantro, and mazorca (corn on the cob), depending on the region. Some top it off with fresh cilantro, onion and squeezed lime — a sort of \"pico de gallo\", minus the tomato. It is also served with a side of sliced avocado and a plate of white rice, which is usually dipped in with each spoonful of soup.\n\nIn the \"Sierra\" of Ecuador, sancocho, also known as fritada, is a comfort food made with pork. In the coastal region, it is similar to the Colombian sancocho. It has the typical ingredients: \"yuca\", plantain, and corn \"choclo\". It can be made of fish, hen, chicken, ox tail, or beef. Due to cultural differences, it can cause confusion when people go from one region to the other.\n\nThe Peruvian sancocho is called \"sancochado\" a baseline: meat chunks, corn, rice and potatoes.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, \"sancocho\" is considered one of the national dishes, along with \"la bandera\" (the flag), consisting of white rice, generally red beans and meat, usually chicken. There is a variant called \"sancocho cruzado\" or \"sancocho de siete carnes\", which includes chicken, beef and pork, with other meats. \"Sancocho de siete carnes\" means \"seven meat sancocho\" and is considered the ultimate sancocho dish. Longaniza, a type of pork sausage, is also used. Sancocho de gallina (hen sancocho) is common as well, often made for special occasions or on weekends. While sancocho de habichuela (bean sancocho) and sancocho de guandules are common, other types of sancocho are very rare.\n\nThere is a similar dish in Costa Rica: It is called olla de carne (meat pot).\n\nAlso known as \"sancocho de gallina\", it is the national dish of Panama. The basic ingredients are chicken, ñame (adding flavor and acting as a thickener, giving it its characteristic texture and brightness), and culantro (giving it most of its characteristic flavor and greenish tone); often yuca, mazorca (corn on the cob) and otoe are added. Other optional ingredients include \"ñampí\" (as the Eddoe variety of Taro is known), chopped onions, garlic and oregano. It is frequently served with white rice on the side, meant to be either mixed in or eaten with each spoonful. Hot sauce is frequently added, depending on regional and individual preferences. Regional varieties include \"Sancocho chorrerano\" (a specialty of the town of La Chorrera, which is only made with free-range chicken, onions, garlic, chili peppers, oregano and ñame) and \"Sancocho chiricano\" (a specialty from Chiriquí Province and the heartiest variety, containing squash in addition to all basic and optional ingredients mentioned before, having a yellowish color as a result). It is often recommended as the best remedy for a hangover. It is used a metaphor for the country's racial diversity due to the varied ingredients that contribute their particular properties to and having an equally important role in the cooking process and final product.\n\nIn El Salvador, it is a stew made with the offal of cattle, such as the stomach.\n\nReflecting its Spanish influence, sancocho is eaten in the Philippines, where the hearty stew is made with fish, beef shanks, three kinds of meat, chicken, pork butt, bacon, chorizo de bilbao and morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) as well as yucca, potatoes, cilantro, corn, cabbage, bok choy, carrots and string beans. Known as cocido in the Philippines, it is often confused with puchero Filipino, which may use ham and different sausages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2285836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2285836", "title": "Gueuze", "text": "Gueuze\n\nGueuze (Dutch \"geuze\", ; French \"gueuze\", ) is a type of lambic, a Belgian beer. It is made by blending young (1-year-old) and old (2- to 3-year-old) lambics, which is bottled for a second fermentation. Because the young lambics are not fully fermented, the blended beer contains fermentable sugars, which allow a second fermentation to occur. \n\nSince gueuze is made by blending lambics, it tastes different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these lambics, the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma that can be found in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and \"barnyard-like\". \n\nIn modern times, some brewers have added sweeteners such as aspartame to their gueuzes to sweeten them, trying to make the beer more appealing to a wider audience. The original, unsweetened version is often referred to as \"Oude Gueuze\" (\"Old Gueuze\") and has become more popular in the early 2000s. Tim Webb, a British writer on Belgian and other beers, comments on the correct use of the term \"'Oude gueuze' or 'oude geuze', now legally defined and referring to a drink made by blending two or more 100% lambic beer.\"\nTraditionally, gueuze is served in champagne bottles, which hold either or . Traditionally, gueuze, and the lambics from which it is made, has been produced in the area known as Pajottenland and in Brussels. However, some non-Pajottenland/Brussels lambic brewers have sprung up and one or two also produce gueuze - see table below. Gueuze (both 'Oude' and others) qualified for the European Union's designation 'TSG' (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) in 1997/98 - see Geographical indications and traditional specialities (EU).\n\nThere is some debate on where the word gueuze originated. One theory is that it originated from \"Geysa\" (geyser), Old Norse for \"gush\", as, during times of vigorous fermentation, Gueuze will spew out of the bunghole of its enclosing oak barrel. Another theory is that it originates from \"gueuze\", the Old Norse word for wheat (which makes up a portion of the lambic grist).\n\nThe most likely theory says that the name stems from the 'Geuzenstraat' (Geuzen Street) in Brussels where a lambic brewery was established. The story is that when the French under Napoleon occupied Belgium and thus Brussels, a lot of Champagne was drunk in Brussels. Champagne was something rather new in Brussels in those days and had become a real hype. This beverage came in strong glass bottles (most beer at the time was supplied in barrels). One brewer, situated in the Geuzenstraat, had the idea to collect the empty Champagne bottles and to refill them with what was called lambic beer. He added a bit of sugar for a second fermentation and re-sealed the bottles with a cork which was similar to the Champagne cork. By doing so, he hoped to benefit a bit from the Champagne hype. The new beer was a success and soon obtained the name \"from the Geuzenstraat\" or gueuze. The bigger gueuze bottles are still very similar to sparkling wines bottles today.\n\nCommercial production of gueuze commenced in the 19th century; modern breweries that produce gueuze include: \nBoth gueuze and lambic are protected under Belgian (since 1965) and European (since 1992) law.\n\nInformation extracted from Webb\n\n\n\nSome American craft breweries have begun producing blends of young and old sour beers to produce their own versions of the traditional gueuze.\n\n\n"}

The sword was kept in the Saint Denis Basilica since at least 1505, and it was moved to the Louvre in 1793.\n\nThis \"Joyeuse\" as preserved today is a composite of various parts added over the centuries of use as coronation sword. But at the core, it consists of a medieval blade of Oakeshott type XII, mostly dated to about the 10th century. Martin Conway argued the blade might date to the early 9th century, opening the possibility that it was indeed the sword of Charlemagne, while Guy Laking dated it to the early 13th century. Some authors have even argued that the medieval blade may have been replaced by a modern replica in 1804 when the sword was prepared for the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nThe Louvre's official website dates the pommel to the 10th to 11th centuries, the crossguard to the 12th and the scabbard to the 13th century.\n\nThe overall height of the sword is 105 cm (41-1/3 inches) with the blade portion making up 82.8 cm (32.6 inches) of that. It is 4.5 cm (1.77 inches) wide at the base, and 2.2 cm (.87 inch) thick. Total weight is 1630 g (3.59 pounds). \n\nBefore the Miholjanec legend had been regarded, the so-called sword of Attila in Vienna was known as the sword of Charlemagne.\n"}

Khumrot are prohibitions or obligations in Jewish life that exceed the requirements of Halakha; some khumrot became customs in some communities over time, e. g., daily ritual immersion in a mikveh in Hasidic Judaism or \"kapparot\" in Haredi Judaism. \n\nSomeone who is \"frum\" is known as a \"frum Jew\", a \"frummer\" (\"pious one\", related to German \"ein Frommer\"), or \"frummie\" (Yinglish diminutive \"pious one\"). These appellations are generally, but not only, applied to Orthodox Judaism, and used by some members of these groups as a self-reference. \n\nTo follow a \"frum\" path in life implies the constant maintenance of an awareness of God by following spiritual practice as a \"makhmir\", meaning \"taking the stricter position on an issue\". In this way, the Ashkenazi \"frum\"-culture is variously seen as a precaution against transgressing the Halakha , or as a way of keeping those who have taken on the stringency separate from those who have not. \n\nIn Ashkenazi Orthodox communities, the Yinglish initialism \"FFB\", meaning \"Frum From Birth\", is often used to refer to a person who was born into a religiously observant family and has maintained this lifestyle, in contrast to a \"BT\", referring to a baal teshuva.\n\nIn the Ashkenazi community, the adjective \"frei\" (Yiddish and German \"free\") is used as an appellation by Jews with a secular background or by those who adhere to non-Orthodox denominations. A person who calls himself \"frei\" means one who is less religious and free from the observance of Halakha that exceeds the baseline requirement, or one who is not religiously observant and feels \"frei\" to do whatever one feels like doing.\n\nSomeone who is extremely frum is labeled a \"frummer\". To be a \"frummer\" (\"more pious person\", related to German \"frömmer\") means to observe \"khumrot\". While the word \"frummer\" is frequently used as an adjective as well, the technically-correct Yiddish comparative of the adjective \"\"frum\"\" is, in fact, \"\"frimer\".\n\n\"Frummer\" can also have a negative connotation, similar to \"Chasid Shoteh\" (\"pious idiot\"), which is how the Talmud (Sotah 21B) describes a man who sees a woman drowning, but refuses to save her, and says, \"It is not proper to look at her, and rescue her.\" A \"frummer\" in that sense is a person displaying a disproportionate emphasis on technical aspects of religion of one's daily life in a manner which actually violates the \"halakha\" in a specific case. \n\nFrum can be used in a negative sense for \"hypocritically pious\", \"holier-than-thou\", \"sanctimonious\"; or in a positive sense for: \"pious\", \"devout\", \"God-fearing\", and \"upright\". The phrase \"frum and \"ehrlich\"\" captures all the positive connotations of these words, to mean roughly \"upright\" or \"righteous\" \"(tzadik)\".\n\nFrum can have other specific meanings in context - for example, describing clothes or homes more in line with Jewish law.\n\n"}

Butter cake is baked with basic ingredients: butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. It is considered as one of the quintessential cakes in American baking. Butter cake originated from the English pound cake, which traditionally used equal amounts of butter, flour, sugar, and eggs to bake a heavy, rich cake.\n\nThe invention of baking powder and other chemical leavening agents during the 19th century substantially increased the flexibility of this traditional pound cake by introducing the possibility of creating lighter, fluffier cakes using these traditional combinations of ingredients, and it is this transformation that brought about the modern butter cake.\n\nButter cakes are traditionally made using a creaming method, in which the butter and sugar are first beaten until fluffy to incorporate air into the butter. Eggs are then added gradually, creating an emulsion, followed by alternating portions of wet and dry ingredients. Butter cakes are typically rich and moist when stored at room temperature, but they tend to stiffen, dry out, and lose flavor when refrigerated, making them unsuitable for filling or frosting in advance with ingredients that must be refrigerated, such as cream cheese frosting and pastry cream.\n\nThe modern way to make Butter cake is by separating the egg white and egg yolk, in a bowl mix the butter, egg yolk and sugar together and beat until fluffy to incorporate air into the butter, beat the egg whites to soft peaks before folding into the mix and gently folding in flour a little at a time.Finally pour into a cake tin lined with parchment paper.\nPre-heat the oven to 160 degrees Celsius or (320 °F) (Depending on your type of oven baking time will vary)\n\n"}

However names ending -ow originating in Eastern Germany, e.g. Saxony, are pronounced with a long unstressed o (). The spelling pronunciation (), which is more intuitive to native speakers of English, is therefore also closer to the original German.\n\nBurow's solution may be used to treat various forms of otitis.

As an FDA approved astringent it is used for the relief of skin irritations due to poison ivy, oak and sumac, and rashes from allergic reactions to soaps, detergents, cosmetics and jewelry.

The word is derived from \"ni\" (down, into) and \"da\" (to bind, \"dana\"). It appears in the \"Rigveda\", such as hymn 10.114.2, and other Hindu scriptures, wherein it means \"primary or first cause, linked cause\"; in other contexts such as \"Rigveda\" 6.32.6, \"nidana\" refers to a rope or band that links, binds or fastens one thing to another, such as a horse to a cart.\n\n\"Nidana\" doctrines of Buddhism are attributed to Shakyamuni Buddha. It has two specific meanings. The more common use refers to the Twelve nidanas or \"\"a concatenation of cause and effect\"\", which is the cycle of rebirth as described by Gautama upon which a re-becoming is thought by Buddhists to rest, which is also called the twelve links of 'dependent origination'.\n\nThe term is also less commonly used with reference to the jhanas or stages of Buddhist meditation. The Twelve nidanas of samsara describe the stages of successive rebirths, based upon ignorance, while the nidana of the jhanas, by contrast, arises from spiritual practice.\n\nAn important example of \"nidanas\" in Buddhism, is the \"Twelve Nidānas\" doctrine where each link is asserted as a primary causal relationship between the connected links. These links present the mechanistic basis of repeated birth, \"Samsara\", and resultant \"Dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness) starting from avidyā (ignorance, misconceptions).\n\nThe term \"Nidana\" appears in numerous ancient and medieval Hindu texts wherein it means \"first cause, primary cause, original or essential cause\". This includes the Upanishads that include theosophical speculations, as well as medical texts such as Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita where a large sub-book is titled \"Nidana-sthana\", as well as in chapters of the Puranas, wherein these discuss cause of disease or various natural phenomena.\n\n"}
{"id": "2306470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2306470", "title": "Qiviut", "text": "Qiviut\n\nQiviuq [sg] or qiviut [pl] ( ; Inuktitut syllabics, ᕿᕕᐅᖅ; Inuinnaqtun, qiviuq; Inupiaq qiviu or qiviuq sometimes spelled qiveut) is the inner wool of the muskox. In Inuktitut the same word can be used to refer to the down feathers of birds. \n\nThe muskox has a two-layered coat, and \"qiviut\" refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The muskox sheds this layer of wool each spring. Qiviut is plucked from the coat of the muskox during the molt or gathered from objects the animals have brushed against; unlike sheep, the animals are not sheared. Much of the commercially available qiviut comes from Canada, and is obtained from the pelts of muskoxen after hunts. In Alaska, qiviut is obtained from farmed animals or gathered from the wild during the molt.\n\nQiviut is stronger and warmer than sheep's wool, and softer than cashmere wool. Wild muskoxen have qiviut fibers approximately 18 micrometres in diameter. Females and young animals have slightly finer wool. Unlike sheep's wool, it does not shrink in water at any temperature, but this means that it also is not useful for felting.\n\nIt is most commonly used for hats and scarves, and is among the softest wools. It is very expensive; a high quality knitted scarf can cost more than $300 U.S., but will last over 20 years with good care.\n\nAn adult muskox can produce of qiviut a year. Qiviut is produced by the muskox's secondary hair follicles, which are not associated with sebaceous glands, and therefore is a much drier fiber than wool, having only about 7 percent oils. The hair follicle density is very high (approximately ) and qiviut is shed in a tightly synchronized spring molting period. The qiviut will loosen from the animal's skin and pull away slightly, creating a \"spectacled\" look around the eyes and becoming visible all over the body at the surface of the pelt. At this stage of the molt, the undercoat is a short but relatively uniform distance from the skin. This lends itself to combing the qiviut from the animal in a single large sheet. If not combed, the qiviut will begin to fall out in clumps or be rubbed off by the animal, and may be plucked off the ground or bushes, but qiviut collected this way is of lower quality and requires more cleaning.\n\nAt the Robert G. White Large Animal Research Station (LARS), a modified bison crush is used to gently but firmly hold the muskoxen in place, and the pelt combed out using a long-toothed comb or hair pick. After the fleece is removed, it is cleaned by hand, removing vegetation and other foreign matter, and then dehaired. Dehairing is the removal of intermediate hairs (greater than in diameter). Dehairing is accomplished by carding as one would cashmere. Mechanical carding can cause breakage and weaken and roughen the qiviut. Because the pelt is combed rather than shaved, very few guard hairs come out with the qiviut using this method. Pelts from hunted animals are shaved, so the dehairing process in this case is more laborious. After dehairing, the qiviut may be cleaned again, if necessary.\n\nThe raw, cleaned qiviut is spun and then the yarn is washed. Natural qiviut is soft grayish brown in color, but it takes dye well and can be found for sale in myriad colors. Bleaching weakens the fiber, however, so many spinners and knitters recommend using only overdyed natural qiviut, which has darker, more subdued colors.\n\nDomestication of the muskox was begun with the Musk Ox Project, headed by John J. Teal, Jr with the first domestic muskox farm in Fairbanks, Alaska. The project continues at the muskox farm in Palmer, Alaska. Oomingmak, the Musk Ox Producers' Cooperative, was formed in the late 1960s by indigenous women on Nunivak Island, with the help of Dr. Teal and Mrs. L. Schell. It is a knitting cooperative that works with qiviut and is still in operation today. The cooperative has its headquarters in Anchorage, Alaska and is owned by approximately 200 native Alaskans from many remote villages in Alaska. The name of the cooperative comes from the Inuit language word for muskox, \"umiŋmak\", \"the animal with skin like a beard.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2312559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2312559", "title": "German Whist", "text": "German Whist\n\nGerman Whist is a variation on classic whist for two players. Also called \"Chinese Whist\", the game is most likely of British origin. For instance, in Sweden the game is usually called \"Hamburger Whist\" after the German city of Hamburg. There are several variants of this game. \nThe most important difference between variants is whether all the 26 tricks count or only the last 13. Another difference is whether trumps should be used or if the game should be about taking as many (\"high play\") - or as few (\"low play\") tricks as possible.\n\nWhile trumps or \"high\"/\"low\" makes little difference to how much luck is involved, the difference between counting all 26 tricks or only the last 13, beginning the so-called \"endgame\" as the hand is finished (beginning at the 14th trick), makes a large difference. When playing this game in two sections, the foreplay and the endgame, this version becomes the most skillful game of all for two players with a common card deck. This is because both players can calculate exactly which 13 cards the opponent has, and plan his or her play based on that knowledge. It isn't possible to know this earlier in the game.\n\nGerman Whist is a two player game using a standard deck of 52 cards ranked A (high) K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 (low) in each suit.\n\nThe initial dealer is chosen by cutting the deck, and the turn to deal alternates after each hand. Each player is dealt 13 cards, dealt one at a time. The twenty-seventh card is placed face-up on the face-down pack. The suit of this face-up card is either the trump suit for the entire hand - or decides whether to play \"high\" (taking as many tricks as possible) or \"low\" (taking as few as possible). If the twenty-seventh card is a hearts or diamond, high is played. If it's a club or spade, low is played. In the latter version the 13 first tricks almost never are counted in the score. Hence the game is split in two sections, known as \"foreplay\" and \"endgame\". (Also other versions of deciding how the game is to be played occurs. For instance alternation between trump and high or low)\n\nThe non-dealer chooses any card to play for the first trick and the other player must follow suit if he can. \nIf both cards are the same suit then the higher card wins. If they are of different suits the first player wins unless the second player played a trump, in which case the trump wins.\nThe winner of the trick takes the face-up card and adds it to his hand, the loser then takes the face-down card below it without showing it to his opponent. The next card in the pack is then turned over and the winner plays first in the next trick. Each player stays with 13 cards in his hand until the pack is exhausted. After this the remaining 13 tricks are played without replenishment until the cards in both players hands are exhausted.\n\nThere are several versions of the opening. But they all come down to the colour of the 27th card (the top of the pack). For instance the 27th card can indicate which trump is to be used. But in other versions the 27th instead shows whether \"low\" or \"high\" are to be played. A black card means the players in the \"endgame\" shall take as few tricks as possible, while a red card means they in the endgame shall take as many tricks as possible.\n\nThere are further at least two variants on scoring. The winner is the player who wins the most tricks in:\n\nThe score count always begins at the 7th trick taken in the endgame. For instance in a \"high\" game 10 vs 3 cards gives 4 points to the one who took 10 tricks. If it was a \"low\" game, the 4 points goes to the other player.\n\nThe strategy for the two variants, in the first stage, is slightly different. In the first variant the player must balance winning the current trick against the probability of winning future tricks.\n\nIn the second variant the player must try to assemble the best possible hand for the endgame. This is however not so simple as it may appear. Assume hearts is trump and you will begin the foreplay. You have four low hearts on your hand, but also a possibility for a good topped suit in spades, and the top card of the pack is two of clubs. Now despite of a \"worthless\" card to play for, playing one's highest trump might reveal the trump situation on the opponent's hand, and You will indeed reduce the numbers of trumps (which isn't \"Your colour\"), and finally, if the opponent plays a lower trump You will know that the opponent may have a good trump colour (which isn't the case if the opponent needs to play another colour) finally by \"winning\" the two of clubs, You will keep the advantage to decide which colour to play next time. In general is it a good idea to attempt to keep \"the serve\", but not always at any costs.\n\nPlaying a card of same value as the card to play for is often good, when it comes to \"middle cards\" like 7 to 10, but even more importantly is to choose colour wisely. But also remember, when the Ace is gone, the King becomes like an Ace, and if the three top cards in a colour is gone, then the Jack is the highest card in that colour, etc. Also the lowest cards are important to know, especially when the play is low. The real \"key\" is however to know which colour to play, in order to win also lower cards, though not by paying too good of Your own good colours. Don't focus so much on bad card at the top of the pack, rather think of the colour to play. If the card to play for suits You well, play a safe card. If the card to play for is \"a middle card\", play a slightly higher card, but just enough high for the opponent to have difficulties to \"come in\".\n\nWhen an Ace is gone, the King becomes like an Ace, etc. Try to remember which card that currently is the highest in each colour. Count especially trumps. But don't be afraid to play trump, as long as it's likely the opponent actually also has trump. (If it is in Your interest that the number of trump cards is reduced in the endgame especially) In \"low\" games try to build up long suits from the bottom. 2-4-6-8-Q-K-A is a great colour to have in a low endgame. Even better is 2-3-5-7-Q-K-A, from which You can give the serve to the opponent, provided at least one card in the same colour exists on the opponent's hand. But \"first\" play all single high cards as soon as possible. When playing low, it is very easy to get trapped and having to take all the last ten tricks due to a miscalculation. The twos are often more important than Aces in high or trump games. (And as soon as a \"deuce\" vanishes in the foreplay, the three takes its place and so on.)\n\nBy counting every colour and the highest known card in every colour one may easier learn which card one's opponent has (or close enough), when the endgame begins. Then you also know the best way to play the endgame cards. With exception of when playing low, the endgame is close to the playing part of bridge.\n\nDownloadable software is available from the following websites:\n"}

These include: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, paranoia, and self-harm.\n\nNurses in this area receive specific training in psychological therapies, building a therapeutic alliance, dealing with challenging behaviour, and the administration of psychiatric medication.\n\nIn most countries, a psychiatric nurse will have to attain a bachelor's degree in nursing to become a Registered Nurse (RN), and specialise in mental health. Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations.\n\nMental health nurses can work in a variety of services, including: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), Acute Medical Units (AMUs), Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs), and Community Mental Health Services (CMHS).\n\nThe history of psychiatry and psychiatric nursing, although disjointed, can be traced back to ancient philosophical thinkers. Marcus Tullius Cicero, in particular, was the first known person to create a questionnaire for the mentally ill using biographical information to determine the best course of psychological treatment and care. Some of the first known psychiatric care centers were constructed in the Middle East during the 8th century. The medieval Muslim physicians and their attendants relied on clinical observations for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn 13th century medieval Europe, psychiatric hospitals were built to house the mentally ill, but there were not any nurses to care for them and treatment was rarely provided. These facilities functioned more as a housing unit for the insane. Throughout the high point of Christianity in Europe, hospitals for the mentally ill believed in using religious intervention. The insane were partnered with “soul friends” to help them reconnect with society. Their primary concern was befriending the melancholy and disturbed, forming intimate spiritual relationships. Today, these soul friends are seen as the first modern psychiatric nurses.\n\nIn the colonial era of the United States, some settlers adapted community health nursing practices. Individuals with mental defects that were deemed as dangerous were incarcerated or kept in cages, maintained and paid fully by community attendants. Wealthier colonists kept their insane relatives either in their attics or cellars and hired attendants, or nurses, to care for them. In other communities, the mentally ill were sold at auctions as slave labor. Others were forced to leave town. As the population in the colonies expanded, informal care for the community failed and small institutions were established. In 1752 the first “lunatics ward” was opened at the Pennsylvania Hospital which attempted to treat the mentally ill. Attendants used the most modern treatments of the time: purging, bleeding, blistering, and shock techniques. Overall, the attendants caring for the patients believed in treating the institutionalized with respect. They believed if the patients were treated as reasonable people, then they would act as such; if they gave them confidence, then patients would rarely abuse it.\n\nThe 1790s saw the beginnings of moral treatment being introduced for people with mental distress. The concept of a safe asylum, proposed by Philippe Pinel and William Tuke, offered protection and care at institutions for patients who had been previously abused or enslaved. In the United States, Dorothea Dix was instrumental in opening 32 state asylums to provide quality care for the ill. Dix also was in charge of the Union Army Nurses during the American Civil War, caring for both Union and Confederate soldiers. Although it was a promising movement, attendants and nurses were often accused of abusing or neglecting the residents and isolating them from their families.\n\nThe formal recognition of psychiatry as a modern and legitimate profession occurred in 1808. In Europe, one of the major advocates for mental health nursing to help psychiatrists was Dr. William Ellis. He proposed giving the “keepers of the insane” better pay and training so more respectable, intelligent people would be attracted to the profession. In his 1836 publication of \"Treatise on Insanity\", he openly stated that an established nursing practice calmed depressed patients and gave hope to the hopeless. However, psychiatric nursing was not formalized in the United States until 1882 when Linda Richards opened Boston City College. This was the first school specifically designed to train nurses in psychiatric care.\n\nThe discrepancy between the founding of psychiatry and the recognition of trained nurses in the field is largely attributed to the attitudes in the 19th century which opposed training women to work in the medical field.\n\nIn 1913 Johns Hopkins University was the first college of nursing in the United States to offer psychiatric nursing as part of its general curriculum. The first psychiatric nursing textbook, \"Nursing Mental Diseases\" by Harriet Bailey, was not published until 1920. It was not until 1950 when the National League for Nursing required all nursing schools to include a clinical experience in psychiatry to receive national accreditation. The first psychiatric nurses faced difficult working conditions. Overcrowding, under-staffing and poor resources required the continuance of custodial care. They were pressured by an increasing patient population that rose dramatically by the end of the 19th century. As a result, labor organizations formed to fight for better pay and fewer hours. Additionally, large asylums were founded to hold the large number of mentally ill, including the famous Kings Park Psychiatric Center in Long Island, New York. At its peak in the 1950s, the center housed more than 33,000 patients and required its own power plant. Nurses were often called “attendants” to imply a more humanitarian approach to care. During this time, attendants primarily kept the facilities clean and maintained order among the patients. They also carried out orders from the physicians.\n\nIn 1963, President John F. Kennedy accelerated the trend towards deinstitutionalization with the Community Mental Health Act. Also, since psychiatric drugs were becoming more available allowing patients to live on their own and the asylums were too expensive, institutions began shutting down. Nursing care thus became more intimate and holistic. Expanded roles were also developed in the 1960s allowing nurses to provide outpatient services such as counseling, psychotherapy, consultations, prescribing medications, along with the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.\n\nThe first developed standard of care was created by the psychiatric division of the American Nurses Association (ANA) in 1973. This standard outlined the responsibilities and expected quality of care of nurses.\n\nIn 1975, the government published a document called \"Better Services for the Mentally Ill\" which reviewed the current standards of psychiatric nursing worldwide and laid out better plans for the future of mental health nursing.\n\nGlobal health care underwent huge expansions in the 1980s, this was due to the governments reaction from the fast increasing demand on health care services. The expansion was continued until the economic crisis of the 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, the Area Health Authorities was terminated.\n\nIn 1983, better structure of hospitals was implemented. General managers were introduced to make decisions, thus creating a better system of operation. 1983 also saw a lot of staff cuts which was heavily felt by all the mental health nurses. However a new training syllabus was introduced in 1982, which offered suitable knowledgeable nurses.\n\nThe 2000s have seen major educational upgrades for nurses to specialise in mental health as well as various financial opportunities.\n\nThe term mental health encompasses a great deal about a single person, including how we feel, how we behave, and how well we function. This single aspect of our person cannot be measured or easily reported but it is possible to obtain a global picture by collecting subjective and objective information to delve into a person’s true mental health and well being. When identifying mental health wellness and planning interventions, here are a few things gathered from the Mental Health Association of Southern Pennsylvania to keep in mind when completing a thorough mental health assessment in the nursing profession:\n\nNursing interventions may be divided into the following categories:\n\nPsychiatric medication is a commonly used intervention and many psychiatric mental health nurses are involved in the administration of medicines, both in oral (e.g. tablet or liquid) form or by intramuscular injection. Nurse practitioners can prescribe medication. Nurses will monitor for side effects and response to these medical treatments by using assessments. Nurses will also offer information on medication so that, where possible, the person in care can make an informed choice, using the best evidence, available.\n\nPsychiatric mental health nurses are also involved in the administration of the treatment of electroconvulsive therapy and assist with the preparation and recovery from the treatment, which involves anesthesia. This treatment is only used in a tiny proportion of cases and only after all other possible treatments have been exhausted.\nA patients consent to receive the treatment must be established and defended by the nurse.\n\nAlong with other nurses, psychiatric mental health nurses will intervene in areas of physical need to ensure that people have good levels of personal hygiene, nutrition, sleep, etc., as well as tending to any concomitant physical ailments.\n\nPsychosocial interventions are increasingly delivered by nurses in mental health settings. These include psychotherapy interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy, and less commonly other interventions, such as milieu therapy or psychodynamic approaches. These interventions can be applied to a broad range of problems including psychosis, depression, and anxiety. Nurses will work with people over a period of time and use psychological methods to teach the person psychological techniques that they can then use to aid recovery and help manage any future crisis in their mental health. In practice, these interventions will be used often, in conjunction with psychiatric medications. Psychosocial interventions are based on evidence-based practice, and therefore the techniques tend to follow set guidelines based upon what has been demonstrated to be effective by nursing research. There has been some criticism that evidence based practice is focused primarily on quantitative research and should reflect also a more qualitative research approach that seeks to understand the meaning of people's experience.\n\nThe basis of this approach is to look at mental illness or distress from the perspective of a spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose, and hope for the person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.\n\nAs with other areas of nursing practice, psychiatric mental health nursing works within nursing models, utilising nursing care plans, and seeks to care for the whole person. However, the emphasis of mental health nursing is on the development of a therapeutic alliance. In practice, this means that the nurse should seek to engage with the person in care in a positive and collaborative way that will empower the patient to draw on his or her inner resources in addition to any other treatment they may be receiving.\n\nThe most important duty of a psychiatric nurse is to maintain a positive therapeutic relationship with patients in a clinical setting. The fundamental elements of mental health care revolve around the interpersonal relations and interactions established between professionals and clients. Caring for people with mental illnesses demands an intensified presence and a strong desire to be supportive. Dziopa and Ahern assert that there are nine critical mental health aspects of the psychiatric nursing practicum: understanding and empathy, individuality, providing support, being there and being available, being genuine, promoting equality, demonstrating respect, demonstrating clear boundaries, and demonstrating self-awareness for the patient.\n\nUnderstanding and empathy from psychiatric nurses reinforces a positive psychological balance for patients. Conveying an understanding is important because it provides patients with a sense of importance. The expression of thoughts and feelings should be encouraged without blaming, judging, or belittling. Feeling important is significant to the lives of people who live in a structured society, who often stigmatise the mentally ill because of their disorder. Empowering patients with feelings of importance will bring them closer to the normality they had before the onset of their disorder. When subjected to fierce personal attacks, the psychiatric nurse retained the desire and ability to understand the patient. The ability to quickly empathise with unfortunate situations proves essential. Involvedness is also required when patients expect nursing staff to understand even when they are unable to express their needs verbally. When a psychiatric nurse gains understanding of the patient, the chances of improving overall treatment greatly increases.\n\nIndividualised care becomes important when nurses need to get to know the patient. To lives this knowledge the psychiatric nurse must see patients as individual people with lives beyond their mental illness. Seeing people as individuals with lives beyond their mental illness is imperative in making patients feel valued and respected. In order to accept the patient as an individual, the psychiatric nurse must not be controlled by his or her own values, or by ideas, and pre-understanding of mental health patients. Individual needs of patients are met by bending the rules of standard interventions and assessment. Psychiatric nurses spoke of the potential to 'bend the rules', which required an interpretation of the unit rules, and the ability to evaluate the risks associated with bending them.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic relationships between nurses and patients need to have positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities, such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch or dinner breaks with patients can improve the quality of support provided. Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder. Psychiatric nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described relief when the nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with nurses.\n\nIn order to make patients feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections have the ability to uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilisation of the quality of time spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable nurses to understand the meaning behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attain a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.\n\nThe act of being genuine must come from within and be expressed by nurses without reluctance. Genuineness requires the nurse to be natural or authentic in their interactions with the patient. In his article about pivotal moments in therapeutic relationships, Welch found that nurses must be in accordance with their values and beliefs. Along with the previous concept, O’Brien concluded that being consistent and reliable in both punctuality and character makes for genuinity. Schafer and Peternelj-Taylor believe that a nurses 'genuineness' is determined through the level of consistency displayed between their verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Similarly, Scanlon found that genuineness was expressed by fulfilling intended tasks. Self-disclosure proves to be the key to being open and honest. It involves the nurse sharing life experiences and is essential to the development of the therapeutic relationship, because as the relationship grows patients are reluctant to give any more information if they feel the relationship is too one sided. Multiple authors found genuine emotion, such as tearfulness, blunt feedback, and straight talk facilitated the therapeutic relationship in the pursuit of being open and honest. The friendship of a therapeutic relationship is different from a sociable friendship because the therapeutic relationship friendship is asymmetrical in nature. The basic concept of genuineness is centered on being true to one’s word. Patients would not trust nurses who fail in complying with what they say or promise.\n\nFor a successful therapeutic relationship to form, a beneficial co-dependency between the nurse and patient must be established. A derogatory view of the patient’s role in the clinical setting dilapidates a therapeutic alliance. While patients need nurses to support their recovery, psychiatric nurses need patients to develop skills and experience. Psychiatric nurses convey themselves as team members or facilitators of the relationship, rather than the leaders. By empowering the patient with a sense of control and involvement, nurses encourage the patient's independence. Sole control of certain situations should not be embedded in the nurse. Equal interactions are established when nurses talk to patients one-on-one. Participating in activities that do not make one person more dominant over the other, such as talking about a mutual interest or getting lunch together strengthen the levels of equality shared between professionals and patients. This can also create the \"illusion of choice\"; giving the patient options, even if limited or confined within structure.\n\nTo develop a quality therapeutic relationship, nurses need to make patients feel respected and important. Accepting patient faults and problems is vital to convey respect—helping the patient see themselves as worthy and worthwhile.\n\nBoundaries are essential for protecting both the patient and the nurse, and maintaining a functional therapeutic relationship. Limit setting helps to shield the patient from embarrassing behaviour, and instills the patient with feelings of safety and containment. Limit setting also protects the nurse from \"burnout”, preserving personal stability—thus promoting a quality relationship.\n\nPsychiatric nurses recognise personal vulnerability in order to develop professionally. Humanistic insight, basic human values, and self-knowledge improves the depth of understanding the self. Different personalities affect the way psychiatric nurses respond to their patients. The more self-aware, the more knowledge on how to approach interactions with patients nurses have. Interpersonal skills needed to form relationships with patients were acquired through learning about oneself. Clinical supervision was found to provide the opportunity for nurses to reflect on patient relationships, to improve clinical skills, and to help repair difficult relationships. The reflections articulated by nurses through clinical supervision help foster self-awareness.\n\nThe \"registered psychiatric nurse\" is a distinct nursing profession in all of the four western provinces. Such nurses carry the designation \"RPN\". In Eastern Canada, an Americanized system of psychiatric nursing is followed. Registered Psychiatric Nurses can also work in all three of the territories in Canada; although, the registration process to work in the territories varies as the psychiatric nurses must be licensed by one of the four provinces.\n\nIn Ireland, mental health nurses undergo a 4-year honors degree training programme. Nurses that trained under the diploma course in Ireland can do a post graduation course to bring their status from diploma to degree.\n\nMental Health Nurses in New Zealand require a diploma or degree in nursing. All nurses are now trained in both general and mental health, as part of their three-year degree training programme. Mental health nurses are often requested to complete a graduate diploma or a post graduate certificate in mental health, if they are employed by a District Health Board. This gives additional training that is specific to working with people with mental health issues.\n\nIn Sweden, to become a \"registered psychiatric nurse\" one must first become a registered nurse which requires a BSc. (Bachelor of Science) in Nursing (three years of full-time study, 180 higher education credits). Then, one must complete one year of graduate studies in psychiatric/mental health nursing (60 higher education credits), which also includes writing a MSc. (Master of Science) thesis. The registered psychiatric nurse is an evolving profession in Sweden. However, unlike in countries such as the US, there is no psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, so in Sweden, the profession cannot for example prescribe pharmacological treatment. Studies indicatet that the nurses themselves wish for such clinical ladder programs to recognize and motivate the continuing professional development of their profession.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland the term \"psychiatric nurse\" has now largely been replaced with \"mental health nurse\". Mental health nurses undergo a 3-4 year training programme at Bachelor's degree level, or a 2 year training programme at Master's degree level, in common with other nurses. However, most of their training is specific to caring for clients with mental health issues. \n\nRMNs can continue into further training as Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs): this requires completion of a 9 month Master's programme. The role includes prescribing medications, being on call for hospital wards and delivering psychosocial interventions to clients.\n\nIn North America, there are three levels of psychiatric nursing.\n\nPsychiatric nurses who earn doctoral degrees (PhD, DNSc, EdD) often are found in practice settings, teaching, doing research, or as administrators in hospitals, agencies or schools of nursing.\n\nIn Australia, to be a psychiatric nurse a bachelor's degree of nursing need to be obtained in order to become a registered nurse (RN) and this degree takes 3 years full-time. Then a diploma in mental health or something similar will need to also be obtained, this is an additional year of study. An Australian psychiatric nurse has duties that may include assessing patients who are mentally ill, observation, helping patients take part in activities, giving medication, observing if the medication is working, assisting in behaviour change programs or visiting patients who are at home. Australian nurses can work in public or private hospitals, institutes, correctional institutes, mental care facilities and homes of the patients.\n\n\n"}

They are different from the finer cut \"fettine\" (\"small/thin slices\"), which never have bone and are generally thinner.\n\nIn Sicilian cuisine, Italian-American cuisine and Italian Australian cuisine, \"braciola\" (plural \"braciole\") are thin slices of meat (typically pork, chicken, beef, or swordfish) that are rolled as a roulade (this category of rolled food is known as \"involtini\" in Italian) with cheese and bread crumbs and fried. In Sicilian, this dish is also called \"bruciuluni\".\n\nBraciole can be cooked along with meatballs and Italian sausage in a Neapolitan ragù or tomato sauce, which some call \"sarsa\" or \"succu\" (Sicilian), or 'Sunday gravy' in some areas of the northeastern United States. They can also be prepared without tomato sauce. There exist many variations on the recipe, including variations of cheese and the addition of vegetables, such as eggplant. Braciole are not exclusively eaten as a main dish, but also as a side dish at dinner, or in a sandwich at lunch.\n\nAfter being stuffed and rolled, braciole are often tied with string or pinned with wooden toothpicks to hold in the stuffing.

Originally common as \"Kanakermann\" among 19th century mariners to refer to comrades from the South Pacific (and later all of Southeast Asia), and carrying a connotation of praise for their seafaring abilities (see Polynesian navigation), it was in the 1960s transferred with more ambiguous connotations to Southern European immigrants, and is now usually used with an exclusively derogatory connotation against people of Turkish or Middle Eastern ancestry.\n\nThe word is originally derived from the Hawaiian word for human, \"kanaka\". Until 2009, several rough translations of the word \"Kanak\" were admitted: \"man\", \"animal man\", and \"wild man\" being the most used. In its resolution n°5195, the Academy of the Polynesian languages Pa ' umotu specified a definition more faithful to the primal Polynesian language \"Mamaka Kaïo\" of origin, that of \"free man\".\n\nAs is the case with the terms nigger or queer in English, Kanake has been re-appropriated by some Turks and used proudly as a term of self-identification. In that context, Kanak Sprak is a term used for the German dialect and manner of speech used among Turks in Germany.\n\nHowever, it is not comparable with words such as \"nigger\" or \"queer/fag\" in a semantic sense, as these are referring to race and sexual identity respectively, while \"Kanake\" refers to \"foreignness\" and in this sense it is therefore a nationalistic derogatory term, not a racist term unless co-opted as such.\n\nDespite this, the word is often used in Hip-Hop, films (e.g. \"\") or in common language as a modified synonym to Nigga. Similar to the use of \"Nigga\" in the United States, this is often done to emphasize a flamboyant manner, violent tendencies, an affinity to crime and a status as an outcast from society, both used as a derogatory term and by young Turks and other minorities themselves.\n\nSome claim that the vernacular use of the word may be on the decline. In an interview on 26 February 2006 with the German weekly \"Die Welt\", German-Turkish author Feridun Zaimoğlu was asked if the word \"Kanake\" still appeared in contemporary language. Zaimoğlu answered, \"That is over. Also pleasant!\" In his first book \"Kanak Sprak\" 1995, Zaimoğlu attempts to express the authentic, tough, and subversive power of slang language spoken by young Turkish male youth in Germany and calls for a new self-confidence.\n\n"}

Meats such as ham, sausage (most commonly andouille and Chaurice), and tasso ham are also frequently used in the dish. The dish is customary – ham was traditionally a Sunday meal and Monday was washday. A pot of beans could sit on the stove and simmer while the women were busy scrubbing clothes. The dish is now fairly common throughout the Southeast. Similar dishes are common in Latin American cuisine, including moros y cristianos and gallo pinto.\n\nRed beans and rice is one of the few New Orleans style dishes to be commonly served both in people's homes and in restaurants. Many neighborhood restaurants continue to offer it as a Monday lunch or dinner special, usually with a side order of either smoked sausage or a pork chop. While Monday washdays are largely a thing of the past, red beans remain a staple for large gatherings such as Super Bowl and Mardi Gras parties. Indeed, red beans and rice is very much part of the New Orleans identity. New Orleanian Louis Armstrong's favorite food was red beans and rice – the musician would sign letters \"Red Beans and Ricely Yours, Louis Armstrong\". And in 1965, the R&B instrumental group Booker T. & the M.G.'s wrote and recorded a song titled \"Red Beans and Rice\" that was originally a B-side but later became popular in its own right.\n\nThe vegetarian dish Rajma chawal is very similar (which translates literally to \"red beans and rice\"), popular in North India. Red beans and rice is also a dietary staple in Central America, where it is known as \"arroz con habichuelas\". The dish is popular in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian and Jamaican cuisine as well.\n\nRed kidney beans or small red beans are used and they are usually (but not always) soaked beforehand.\n\nThe dish is very nutritious. Rice is rich in starch, an excellent source of energy. Rice also has iron, vitamin B and protein. Beans also contain a good amount of iron and an even greater amount of protein than rice.

Another variation of a grilled cheese, is to melt and fry cheese on the outside of the bread, as well as melt the cheese in the middle of the bread. When this is done, it produces a crunchy fried cheese exterior to the sandwich. \n\nAnother form of cooked cheese sandwich is the \"cheese toastie\" or \"toastie\", a dish particularly popular in the United Kingdom that is prepared by either baking or grilling a cheese sandwich in an oven, or toasting bag in an electric toaster, or using a pie iron in order to toast the bread and melt the cheese. It is usually served as a snack, or as a (usually lunchtime) meal, in most cases with a side of salad.\n\nThe cheese dream, an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich, became popular in the U.S. during the Great Depression.\n\nU.S. government cookbooks describe Navy cooks broiling \"American cheese filling sandwiches\" during World War II. Many versions of the grilled cheese sandwich can now be found on restaurant menus across the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIn the United States, grilled cheese sandwiches are often served with soup (usually tomato soup), and may be served as a whole meal in the United States and other countries. This combination of grilled cheese and soup is referred to as a \"comfort food\".\n\n"}

Its name is derived from the pouring process of \"pulling\" the drink during preparation. It is made from a strong brew of black tea blended with condensed milk. It is the national drink of Malaysia.\n\nThe origins of \"teh tarik\" can be traced to Indian Muslim immigrants in the Malay Peninsula who set up drink stalls at the entrance of rubber plantations after World War II to serve the workers there. Since colonial times, \"teh tarik\" has been a popular Malaysian Indian cuisine for many in British Malaya and Singapore. Traditionally, \"teh tarik\" has been seen served with the Roti canai which has become a popular breakfast set by Malaysians until today.\n\nAn element of showmanship exists in the preparation of \"teh tarik\". The ability to drag a long stream of tea above the heads of the patrons without giving them a shower is an amusing novelty for the locals and tourists alike. In Malaysia, there are occasions where \"teh tarik\" brewers gather for competitions and performances to show their skills. \"Teh tarik\" has become recognised along with \"nasi lemak\" as part of the food and beverage heritage of Malaysia by the Malaysian government ministry.\n\nThe mixture is poured back and forth repeatedly between two vessels from a height, giving it a thick frothy top. This process cools the tea to optimal drinking temperatures, thoroughly mixes the tea with the condensed milk, and improves its flavour. This is often compared to the decantering of toddy to enhance its flavour.\n\nLocally and regionally sourced tea used for \"teh tarik\" are not of the highest grade. Despite the strong aroma from the common Ceylonese variety, the taste is rather acrid and generally would not go well with a little cream or fresh milk like other fine tea. Hence condensed milk is used to balance any overpowering taste with its creamy and sweet flavour.\n\nThe term \"kurang manis\", which can be translated to \"less sweet\", is a common request for those who are health conscious or not fond of sugary drinks, as \"teh tarik\" is typically prepared on the sweet side to taste by most vendors.\n\n\n"}

Many of these drinks end with the Sino-Korean word \"-ju\" (), and some end with the native Korean word \"-sul\". The Sino-Korean \"-ju\" is not used as an independent noun.\n\nThere are an estimated 1,000 or more kinds of alcoholic drinks in Korea. Most are made from rice, and are fermented with the aid of yeast and \"nuruk\" (a wheat-based source of the enzyme amylase). Fruits, flowers, herbs and other natural ingredients have also been used to craft traditional Korean alcoholic drinks. There are six distinct flavors: sweet, sour, pungent, roasted, bitter and spicy. When the flavors are balanced, the alcohol is considered good quality.\n\nMost traditional Korean alcoholic drinks are rice wines, fermented with the aid of yeast and \"nuruk\" (a wheat-based source of the enzyme amylase). Main varieties include clear rice wines (\"cheongju\"), milky rice wine (\"takju\"), distilled liquor (\"soju\"), fruit wine (\"gwasil-ju\"), flower wines, and medicinal wines.\n\n\"Makgeolli\" (also known as \"takju\" and \"nongju\"), is a milky, sweet alcoholic drink made from rice. It is one of Korea's most-popular alcoholic drinks. The oldest traditional Korean rice wine, its alcohol content is six to seven percent. It is fermented naturally and not filtered, which gives it its milky-white color and leaves a chalky residue at the bottom. Thick and smooth. It tastes sweet and slightly tangy, with a cool aftertaste. \"Makgeolli\" is served in a bowl, rather than a cup.\n\nIn \"Poetic Records of Emperors and Kings\", written during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), the drink was first mentioned in the founding story of the Goguryeo Kingdom during the reign of King Dongmyeong (37-19 BC). \"Makgeolli\" is brewed with classical methods, using \"nuruk\" (molded cereal which produces hydrolysable enzymes, decomposing macromolecules to monomers for yeast growth) cooked rice, water, barley and yeast. The brewing process has two steps: seed and main mash and main fermentation. Seed mash is the process of obtaining actively-growing yeasts and enzymes in the mixture of yeast and \"nuruk\". The main mash acquire tastes and aromas from the transformation of nutrients and amino acids derived from the rice. Main fermentation lasts for about a week.\n\nDue to the microorganisms present during fermentation, it contains 1.9 percent protein, over 10 amino acids, vitamin B, inositol and choline. \"Makgeolli\" is reported to increase metabolism, relieve fatigue and improve the complexion.\n\nA regional, slightly-creamier variant, originally from Gyeonggi-do, is called \"dongdongju\". Another variety, called \"ihwaju\" (hangul: ; hanja: ; \"pear-blossom wine\") is so named because it is brewed from rice with rice malt which ferments during the pear-blossom season. \"Ihwaju\" is often so thick that it is eaten with a spoon. A similar drink is known as \"Gamju\"; this name is also used for non-alcoholic sweet drinks, including \"Sikhye\" ().\n\n\"Cheongju\", or \"yakju\", is a refined rice wine made from steamed rice which has undergone several fermentation stages. Also known as \"myeongyakju\" or \"beopju\", it is distinguished from \"takju\" by its relative clarity. Varieties include \"baekhaju\" (백하주), made from glutinous rice and \"nuruk\", and \"heukmeeju\" (hangul: 흑미주; hanja: 黑米酒; \"black rice wine\", made from black rice).\n\n\"Yakju\" is brewed with boiled rice, yeast and water. If chrysanthemum is included, it is called \"gukhwaju\"; if azalea is added, it is called \"dugyeonju\"; if pine sprouts are used, it is called \"songsunju\"; if lotus leaves are added, it is called \"ywonyeopju\"; if ginseng is used, it is called \"insamju\". \"Takju\" and \"cheongju\" are sometimes distilled, with medicinal herbs added to the distilled liquor. This mixed liquor is brewed to enhance the medicinal effects of the herbs.\n\n\"Cheongju\" is similar to Japanese \"sake\". Chung Ha is a popular brand which is widely available in Korean restaurants. Local variations include \"beopju\", brewed in Gyeongju.\n\nThis \"yakju\" is brewed with flowers and leaves for a distinctive flavor. \"Kookhwaju\" (chrysanthemum wine), \"omijaju\", \"songjeolju\" and \"dugyeonju\" are types of \"gahyanggokju\".\n\nA number of Korean traditional wines are produced from flowers. These include wines made from chrysanthemums (\"gukhwaju\"), acacia flowers, \"maesil\" and peach blossoms, honeysuckle, wild roses, and sweet-briar petals and berries.\n\n\"Dugyeonju\" (두견주, 杜鵑酒) is a wine made from azalea petals which is produced in Chungcheong Province. Sweet, viscous and light-yellowish-brown in color, it contains about 21 percent alcohol. \"Myeoncheon Dugyeonju\" is the South Korean government's Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 86-2.\nMedicinal liqueurs, known as \"yagyongju\" (, ), are produced by combining seeds, herbs and roots with alcohol.\n\n\"Honju\" is brewed with grain by adding \"soju\". \"Gwaha-ju\" and \"songsun-ju\" are types of \"honju\".\n\n\n\nIn the 13th century, during the Goryeo dynasty, Mongol invaders brought \"soju\" (known as \"araki\") with them. \"Araki\" is derived from the Arabic \"araq\" (liquor). \"Soju\" was originally developed in Arabia, and passed through Mongolia on its way to Korea. Distilled liquor was new to Koreans, who were accustomed to fermented alcoholic drinks such as \"makgeolli\". Mongol camps such as Kaesong, Andong and Jeju Island are well-known \"soju\"-producing regions. During the late 20th century, \"soju\" flavored with lemon or green tea became available. The Japanese version is known as \"shōchū\".\n\n\"Danyangbeop\" (single-brew) or \"leeyangbeop\" (double-brew) are traditional grain-wine brewing methods. \"Takju\" or \"cheongju\" is distilled to produce \"soju\". Andong \"soju\" distinctive flavor is well-known in the city. \"Okroju\" from Gyeonggi Province originated in Hanyang during the late Joseon dynasty. \"Munbae-ju\" is South Korea's Important Intangible Cultural Property 86‑1. It is a traditional liquor made from malted millet, sorghum, wheat, rice and \"nuruk\", with a strength of 40 percent alcohol by volume. \"Munbae-ju\" originated in the Pyongyang region and is known for its fragrance, which is said to resemble the flower of the \"munbae\" (pear) tree.\n\nDistilled liquors also include \"goryangju\" and \"okroju\".\n\n\"Yagyong-jeungryuju\" (medicinal liquor) include:\n\nKorea has a number of traditional fruit wines, produced by combining fruits or berries with alcohol. \"Podoju\" (포도주, 葡萄酒) is made from rice wine which is mixed with grapes.

The wrapper calls them \"a fat free food\" and they are marketed in different colors and flavors.\n\nAccording to the U.S. distribution packages, the candy is made out of the following ingredients:\n\nOne of the ingredients in Swedish Fish is invert sugar, a combination of glucose and fructose. Invert sugar is important in Swedish Fish due to its ability to retain moisture.\n\nFructose has high solubility, therefore it holds more water and crystallizes less easily. This is why Swedish Fish have a very long shelf life and do not spoil easily.\n\nSwedish Fish contain modified cornstarch which is used primarily to form its shape. It is utilized as a medium in trays when the product is put in them to be molded. In addition, white mineral oil is added to these trays to supplement the starch, prevent the candy from crumbling, and give it a shiny coating.\n\nCarnauba wax is used in Swedish Fish as a coating and gives the candy a waxy texture.\n\nCitric acid gives the Swedish Fish an even longer shelf life.\n\nIn Sweden, a large share of confectionery sales is sold as pick and mix. Wine gums are sold in many different shapes, of which fish is just one. The Swedish Fish candy is marketed under the name \"pastellfiskar\", literally \"pastel fish\", and under the Malaco brand among others. The fish shaped candies are also part of various Malaco bags of mixed candy. This candy bag has been sold for many years and is still a favorite among Swedes.\n\nToday the Swedish Fish consumed in North America are made in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and Turkey by Mondelēz International. In Canada, Swedish Fish are distributed under Cadbury's Maynards brand. \n\nThe fish are distributed in the U.S. by Mondelēz International, and are most commonly found in specialty candy stores in which they can be bought by the ounce. The fish-shaped candy gained enough popularity on its own to where the Malaco, and later Cadbury, company had to do little advertising for the product, until this past decade. A recent resurgence in popularity has resulted in greater accessibility in supermarkets and convenience stores where they are often sold prepackaged in plastic bags. Building upon this resurgence, the company recently created \"Giant Fish\" television advertisements and a \"Treadin' Water\" YouTube mini-series, which follows the miscellaneous adventures of four friends and a Giant Swedish Fish sharing an apartment. The first few episodes of the mini-series were published onto YouTube on May 9th 2016. \n\nOriginally colored red with a flavor unique to the candy (often guessed to be lingonberry, but never verified), they are now also available in several different colors, such as Orange & Lemon-Lime. Purple Swedish Fish in grape flavor were discontinued in 2006. The fish come in two different sizes. Initially, the smaller fish came only in red; now fish of both sizes are available in all flavors. According to a visit to the factory on the Food Network's show \"Unwrapped\", green is not lime, but pineapple flavor, while yellow is a lemon-lime flavor.\n\nAlthough well known and enjoyed across the U.S. today, Swedish Fish only hit the U.S. market in the late 1950s. The original owner of these candies was a Swedish company called Malaco, which wanted to expand its retail to North America. Wanting to create a product that reflected the culture of Sweden in some way, a fish-shaped gummy candy was created. Fishing was and is still a large part of Sweden's culture, and fish is a considerable part of the Swedish diet. Mondelez distributes the candy in the U.S. today, but the fish gummies are still distributed by Malaco in Sweden.\n\nIn 2009, Rita's Italian Ice, a U.S. chain which serves Italian ice and Frozen Custard, debuted a red Swedish Fish flavored Italian ice as a cobranded product.\n\nTrident, a gum company owned by Mondelez Global, LLC, carries a Swedish Fish flavor of their Trident Layers line, which is advertised as \"Berry + Lemon\" flavor (berry top and bottom, lemon in the middle).\n\nIn 2016, Nabisco created a test-market product Swedish Fish Oreos, available at Kroger grocery stores nationwide.\n\n"}

{"id": "2321112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321112", "title": "Descamisado", "text": "Descamisado\n\nDescamisado () is a Spanish word that literally means \"without shirt\" or \"shirtless\". \n\nThe term was originally used by the narrator in Victor Hugo's seminal 1862 novel \"Les Misérables\" to refer to the revolutionary Spanish masses. Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo, the French (Bourbon) monarchy was restored to power. The Bourbons acted to prop up the Spanish monarchy against the popular forces of the Spanish social revolution in the Spanish War of 1823. Hugo's character is commenting on the use of the term by the supporters of the French Bourbons. The word was used pejoratively and in direct comparison to the derogative term applied to the French popular masses, the \"sans-culottes\" of the French bourgeoisie revolution of 1789.\n\nIn the 20th century, it was also used as an insult by the elite of Argentina to describe the followers of Juan Perón, who served as president of Argentina from 1946 until 1955, and then again briefly from 1973 to 1974. The term was later reclaimed as a term of pride, with Juan Perón and his wife Eva Perón affectionately referring to their followers as \"descamisados\". And during his 1945 campaign for president, Juan Perón toured the country on a train that he named \"El Descamisado\".\n\nHowever, the first usage of the term in the history of Argentina dates back to the 19th century. Tomás de Iriarte described in his memories a time when he was walking with Carlos María de Alvear and found Manuel Dorrego with dirty and broken clothes. Iriarte wrote that \"\"Excusado es decir que esto era estudiado para captarse la multitud, los descamisados\".\" (\"Needless to say, this was planned to captivate the multitude, the shirtless.\")\n\nBy most accounts, the term has its modern origins on October 17, 1945, when thousands of supporters of Juan Perón gathered in front of the Casa Rosada making a demonstration to demand Perón's release from prison. While waiting for Perón on this hot day, many men in the crowd removed their shirts—hence the term \"shirtless\". However, there is much debate among scholars in regards to the origins of the label. Some claim that the word was coined to describe the working poor, the social class from which Perón drew the greatest amount of his political backing, who were so downtrodden that they could not have afforded to buy shirts. Perón's use of the labor unions as a means of consolidating his power lends credibility to the claim.\n\nThe \"descamisados\" of Peronism have occasionally been compared to the \"sans-culottes\" of the French Revolution, though such a comparison should be made with caution.\n\nIn 1989, Fernando Collor de Mello in his presidential campaign used \"descamisados\" and \"pés descalços\" (\"shoeless\") to refer to the poor people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2321527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2321527", "title": "Sangharaj Nikaya", "text": "Sangharaj Nikaya\n\nThe Sangharaja Nikaya is a tradition of Theravada Buddhism, located in Bangladesh. \n\nThe word Nikaya is Pali and literally means \"volume\". It refers to the sections of the Tipitaka. However, an alternate usage is practiced in Southeast Asia, in which the word \"Nikaya\" is a respectful term for a monastic community.\n\nThe community consists largely of rural Bengali Buddhists. It was formed in 1864 by Sangharaja Saramedha Mahasthavira.\n\nFrom the 13th to the middle of the 19th century, Bengali Buddhism underwent its own \"Dark age\". In this time, much cross-over between Hinduism and Buddhism occurred, such that Hindu deities such as Shiva, Lakshmi, and Durga were worshipped by Buddhists, as \"Buddhist\" deities. This went so far as to include animal sacrifice, at the time an acceptable practice in Hinduism.\n\nMoreover, the rules of the Vinaya began to be re-interpreted and the canonical text itself more or less fell by the wayside. Monks were commonly involved in leading a household life, having families, and even serving as \"matchmakers\". It was under these conditions that the Sangharaj of Myanmar, Saramitra Mahasthabir, inaugurated his reform movement in the 19th century.\n\nSaramitra Mahasthabir arrived at the Chittagong province of Bangladesh in 1856 after being invited by Radha Charan Mahasthabir, an important Bengali monk. While in Bangladesh, the Sangharaj travelled between towns in order to see for himself the state of Bengali affairs. He remained in Bangladesh for a few months before returning to Myanmar.\n\nNine years later, in 1864, the Sangharaj returned to Chittagong at the invitation of Bengali monks. Arriving with an entourage of his own students, the Sangharaj began his reform movement within the Sangha. He chastised monks for following practices that the Vinaya clearly outlaws, such as animal sacrifice, using of money, maintaining a family, drinking alcohol, and eating food (especially meat) not offered. He also attacked the practice of ordaining monks below the age of 20 - full ordination is only available to those over the age of twenty. Likewise, he attacked the laxity in the order which allowed those who clearly were not suited to the religious life to remain. \n\nAfter his efforts to reform the Sangha, the Sangharaj turned his attention toward lay practice and spoke against animal sacrifice and the worship of gods. \n\nSaramitra Mahasthabir became highly influential and persuaded a growing number of monks to be re-ordained as a gesture of their adherence to the reform movement. \n\nThis movement to re-ordain under the auspices of a \"Buddhist Reformation\" marked the beginning of what has now become the Sangharaj Nikaya. Saramitra Mahasthabir performed upasampada for a group of seven monks at Pahartali-Mahamuni, and this initial group of eight began to rapidly expand. \n\nWith a new nikaya under his authority, the Sangharaj became highly effective at eliminating the worship of gods and the practice of tantra.\n\nAn anti-reformation movement came into being in order to counter-act that which was led by Saramitra Mahasthabir. This movement became known as the Mahasthabir Nikaya and was led by none other than Radha Charan Mahasthabir, the Bengali monk who first invited Saramitra Mahasthabir to Bangladesh. \n\nIt's important to note, however, that the Mahasthabir did not oppose the Sangharaj on doctrinal grounds - they did not advocate the practices the Sangharaj Nikaya attempted to eradicate. In point of fact, they are doctrinally \"identical\" to the Sangharaj Nikaya. However, the Mahasthabir Nikaya believed that a Bengali Buddhist order should not come under a powerful influence from a foreign entity. They opposed the Sangharaj Nikaya on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was foreign in origin, not on the grounds that the Sangharaj Nikaya was degenerate. Differences between the lineages are purely practical, i.e., they advocate different day-to-day practices for their monks. As such, differences are extremely minimal, and important only to the monastic sangha. Laity following the different traditions did not particularly differentiate between the two. The distinction served only to maintain an organizational front, not a doctrinal opposition.\n\n"}

{"id": "2324008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2324008", "title": "Panforte", "text": "Panforte\n\nPanforte is a traditional chewy Italian dessert containing fruits and nuts. It is similar to a florentine but much thicker, or a little like a lebkuchen. Its origins date back to the crusaders who discovered it in Turkey. The soldiers used this staple on their long marches as it kept well due its excessive honey based content. Honey was abundant in Turkey and in the Middle East and formed part of the Turkish delight and other desserts. There are references to the Crusaders carrying panforte, a durable confection, with them on their quests, and to the use of panforte in surviving sieges. They, in turn brought it back on their long voyage back home. In Italy's Tuscany region, particularly Siena, today claims to have been the origin of this dessert. \n\nGiven that honey was such a prized and scarce commodity from the Holy Land, documents from 1205 show that panforte was paid to the monks and nuns of a local monastery as a tax or tithe which was due on the seventh of February that year. Literally, panforte means \"strong bread\" which refers to the spicy flavour. Originally the Sienese called it \"panpepato\" (peppered bread), due to the strong pepper used. Other Arab influences in Northern Italian cuisine include the Schiaccia briaca and Alchermes. The latter, though prized as a Tuscan specialty, actually comes from Persia where it is considered an elixir for longevity. The name comes from the Arabic and Persian words that describe the liqueur's striking scarlet-pink colour, originally made from cochineal insects. \n\nThe process of making panforte is fairly simple.

Typically a sugar solution or syrup is made and heated until it browns and becomes thick, producing a caramelized candy syrup. This hot candy is then mixed with popped popcorn, and allowed to cool. Sometimes a candy thermometer is used, as making caramel is time-consuming and requires skill to make well without burning the sugar. The process creates a sweet flavored, crunchy snack food or treat. Some varieties, after coating with the candy syrup, are baked in an oven to crisp the mixture. Mixes of caramel corn sometimes contain nuts, such as peanuts, pecans, almonds, or cashews.\n\nThe combination of caramel and corn dates back at least as far as the 1890s with the strong molasses flavor of Cracker Jack, an early version of which was introduced at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The lighter, sweet but un-caramelized kettle corn, may be a North American Colonial predecessor to caramel corn.\n\nThere are many commercial brands and forms of caramel corn available, such as Cracker Jack, Fiddle Faddle, Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs, and Crunch 'n Munch. In grocery stores, at cinemas, and convenience stores, pre-bagged caramel corn made locally may also be sold. The Maryland-based Fisher's Popcorn and Chicago-based Nuts on Clark are examples of specialty caramel corn and popcorn companies.\n\nCandy-coated popcorn is defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.\n\n"}

Enviga is a trademark of Nestlé licensed to Beverage Partners Worldwide, a joint-venture between The Coca-Cola Company and Nestlé. It is available in three flavors: Green Tea, Tropical Pomegranate, and Mixed Berry. According to Coca-Cola, Enviga burns 60 to 100 calories per three 12-oz.(330 ml) cans due to its high EGCG and caffeine content. This is disputed by some researchers and public advocates.\n\nA can of Enviga has 5 calories, 100 mg of caffeine, 35 mg of sodium, and 20% of the daily recommended calcium based on a 2,000 calorie diet. It is sweetened with aspartame and has no carbohydrates, fat, or protein.\n\nIn February 2007, the watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) filed a lawsuit over company claims that Enviga acts as a calorie-burning and weight-loss product, as a \"negative calorie\" drink. The group claims that if Coca-Cola and Nestlé stop marketing the product as a calorie-burner, they would drop possible litigation. The beverage makers responded that they have deliberately avoided claims that Enviga is a weight-loss product, and that there exists independent research to substantiate the effects of the product. The watchdog group alleged that it was only a 3-day study, and that it was only presented in a conference by the Obesity Society, the editors of journal \"Obesity\", where their conclusions were rejected. The lack of validity of the study was later referred to by the Attorney General in the settlement. Studies on the combination of caffeine and green tea anti-oxidant have given mixed results, and the results are not conclusive.\n\nThe State of Connecticut also investigated the calorie-burning qualities of the drink. The State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal demanded all scientific research associated with its calorie-burning qualities.\n\nIn February 2009 the companies made a settlement with Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, affecting several US states. They agreed to pay $650,000 to the states, remove any claims about weight loss, and add disclaimers that weight loss can only occur via diet and exercise. According to the US Federal News Service, the settlement requires that \"any marketing of Enviga, or a similarly formulated beverage, that uses the terms 'the calorie burner,' 'negative calories,' 'drink negative,' or makes any claims explicitly or implicitly that consumers will burn calories by drinking Enviga, there must be a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the product does not produce weight loss without diet and exercise.\"\n\nIn 2010, a US court of appeals didn't allow a woman to sue Coca-Cola for weight-loss false advertising, and CSPI reported that it wouldn't appeal the decision. CSPI said that the sales of Enviga had collapsed after its 2009 settlement, and that it had already met its goal of informing customers about the lack of efficacy of the beverage. CSPI announced that it was suing Coca-Cola again, but this time for its new beverage Vitaminwater.\n\nAs reported in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", flavoured bottled water, sports drinks and teas, are increasing sales with the decline in sales of sugary soft drinks - with cold tea the fastest growing non-carbonated beverage category in the U.S. during the first half of 2006.

It is a mix of sliced potatoes, sliced onions, cubed mutton, beef, and pork which have been marinated overnight in Alsatian white wine and juniper berries and slow-cooked in a bread-dough sealed ceramic casserole dish. Leeks, thyme, parsley, garlic, carrots and marjoram are other commonly added ingredients for flavor and color.\n\nAlsatian people often eat that dish for a special occasion, like Christmas.\n\nThe Baekeoffe is a dish inspired from the Hamin , an Hebraic traditional dish of Shabbat. Because of the spiritual prohibition of using the fire from Friday night to Saturday night, the Jews had to prepare food for Saturday on Friday afternoon, and then would give the dish to the baker, who would keep it warm in his oven until Saturday noon.\n\nTraditionally, the women would prepare this dish on Saturday evening and leave it with the baker to cook in his gradually cooling oven on Sunday while they attended the lengthy Lutheran church services once typical to the culture. The baker would take a \"rope\" of dough and line the rim of a large, heavy ceramic casserole, then place the lid upon it for an extremely tight seal. This kept the moisture in the container. On the way back from church, the women would pick up their casserole and a loaf of bread. This provided a meal to the Alsatians that respected the strict Lutheran rules of the Sabbath. Part of the ritual is breaking the crust formed by the rope of dough.\n\nAnother version of the story of the origin of this dish is that women in France would do laundry on Mondays and thus not have time to cook. They would drop the pots off at the baker on Monday morning and do the laundry. When the children returned home from school they would then pick up the pot at the baker and carry it home with them. This version of the story may be closer to reality as bakers were often closed on Sundays.\n\n"}

It is the opposite of the word \"autochtoon\" (in English \"autochthonous\" or \"autochthon\"; from Greek αὐτόχθων, from αὐτός [\"autos\"] self/same and again χθών [chthōn] soil/earth/land), literally meaning \"emerging from this soil\".\n\nIn the Netherlands (and Flanders), the term \"allochtoon\" was widely used to refer to immigrants and their descendants. Officially the term \"allochtoon\" was much more specific and referred to anyone who had at least one parent born outside the Netherlands. The antonym \"autochtoon\" was less widely used, but it roughly corresponded to \"ethnic Dutch\". Among a number of immigrant groups living in the Netherlands, a \"\"Dutch\"\" person (though they are themselves Dutch citizens) usually refers to the ethnic Dutch.\n\nIn 1950, Dutch descent, Dutch nationality, and Dutch citizenship were in practice identical. Dutch society consisted mostly of ethnic Dutch, with some colonial influences and sizeable minorities of German and Flemish heritage. In 1950, most Dutch were either Catholic or Protestant, with some atheists. Decolonisation and immigration from the 1960s on altered the ethnic and religious composition of the country. This development has made the 'ethnicity' and national identity of the Dutch a political issue.\n\nDutch nationality law is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis (\"right of blood\"). In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth.\n\nThe Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) used the definition that at least one of the parents is not born in the Netherlands.\n\nA first distinction was made between first-generation and second-generation newcomers.\nNote that someone who was born abroad, but with both parents born in the Netherlands, was an \"autochtoon\".\n\nA further distinction was made between \"Western\" and \"non-Western\" \"allochtoon\" people. A non-Western \"allochtoon\" was someone whose 'country of origin' was or lied in Turkey, Africa, Latin America and Asia, with the exception of Indonesia (or the former Dutch East Indies) and Japan.\n\nThis last distinction was made because the official definition of \"allochtoon\" deviated from the common use in popular speech, where people referred to someone as \"allochtoon\" only when that person was an immigrant or an asylum seeker who was clearly distinct in ethnicity, clothing or behaviour from the traditional Dutch society. However, in the official sense, the largest group of \"allochtoon\" people were of German ancestry. The groups that people usually thought of when they heard the word \"allochtoon\" were those of Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Dutch-Antillean ancestry. As of 2006, the first three groups comprise roughly 350,000 people each, together constituting just over 6% of the population. So a new term was introduced that lied closer to that meaning, \"niet-westers \"allochtoon\"\", which excluded \"allochtoon\" people from Europe, Japan (a developed high income country) and Indonesia (a former colony), but not those from the Netherlands Antilles and Suriname, even though the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and those from Suriname immigrated when that country was still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This definition coincided better with the popular conception of the word as signifying people of low socio-economic status who are \"different from us\".\n\nAlthough some viewed the usage of \"allochtoon\" as a stigma, several members of the Dutch Royal Family were officially \"allochtoon\" people, as one of the parents was foreign-born. This included 'western-allochtoon' current monarch Willem Alexander, as well as his 'non-western allochtoon' wife Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and their children.\n\nAs of November 1, 2016, the Statistics Netherlands stopped using the terms \"allochtoon\" and \"autochtoon\". Instead, it distinguishes people with a migrant background and people with a Dutch background.\n\nOriginally proposed as a neutral term, the use of the term \"allochtoon\" has been criticized as being stigmatizing. There is a regular stream of newspaper articles reporting statistics that unfavourably distinguish \"allochtoon\" people from the rest of the Dutch.\n\nIn 2013, the city council of Amsterdam decided to stop using the term because of its divisive effect.\n\nAs of 2016, the term \"allochtoon\" is no longer used by the Dutch government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2341068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341068", "title": "Rubric", "text": "Rubric\n\nA rubric is a word or section of text that is traditionally written or printed in red ink for emphasis. The word derives from the , meaning red ochre or red chalk, and originates in Medieval illuminated manuscripts from the 13th century or earlier. In these, red letters were used to highlight initial capitals (particularly of psalms), section headings and names of religious significance, a practice known as rubrication, which was a separate stage in the production of a manuscript.\n\nRubric can also mean the red ink or paint used to make rubrics, or the pigment used to make it. Although red was most often used, other colours came into use from the late Middle Ages onwards, and the word rubric was used for these also.\n\nVarious figurative senses of the word have been extended from its original meaning. Usually these senses are used within the set phrase \"under [whatever] rubric,\" for example, \"under this rubric, [X is true],\" or \"[X was done] under the rubric of Y.\" These senses are defined in part by \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\" as follows: \"an authoritative rule\"; \"the title of a statute\"; \"something under which a thing is classed: CATEGORY\"; \"an explanatory or introductory commentary: GLOSS\"; \"an established rule, tradition, or custom\"; \"a guide listing specific criteria for grading or scoring academic [assignments].\" (See \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\" for the full listing.)\n\nInstructions for a priest explaining what he must do during a liturgy were also rubricated in missals and the other liturgical books, and the texts to be spoken aloud were in black. From this, \"rubric\" has a secondary denotation of an instruction in a text, regardless of how it is actually inscribed. This is the oldest recorded definition in English, found in 1375. Less formally, \"rubrics\" may refer to any liturgical action customarily performed, whether or not pursuant to a written instruction. The history, status, and authority of the content of rubrics are significant, and sometimes controversial, among liturgical scholars. In the past, some theologians distinguished between rubrics they considered of Divine origin and those merely of human origin. Rubrics were probably originally verbal, and then written in separate volumes. The earliest extant liturgical books do not contain them, but from references in texts of the first millennium it appears that written versions existed. Full rubrics regarding matters such as vesture, appearance of the altar, timing of specific liturgies, and similar matters still may be published separately. In modern liturgical books, e. g. the Catholic \"Roman Missal\", lengthy general rubrics, probably printed in black, pertain to such matters and preface the actual order of liturgies, which contain shorter, specific rubrics that still are usually rubricated. Red is also often used to distinguish words spoken by the celebrant and those by the congregation, or by other specific persons involved in the liturgy, e. g. those marrying.\n\nWith the arrival of printing, other typographic effects such as italic type, bolded type, or different sizes of type, were used to emphasize a section of text, and as printing in two colours is more expensive and time consuming, rubrication has tended to be reserved for sacred and liturgical books or luxury editions of other works.\n\nWilliam Morris's medievally inspired typography for the Kelmscott Press at the end of the 19th century included chapter titles and other accents in red, or rarely blue, ink, and was influential on small press art typography associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in both England and the United States, particularly the work of the Ashendene, Doves, and Roycroft Presses.\n\nAround 1900, rubrication was incorporated into a Red letter edition of the King James Version of the Bible to distinguish the Dominical words, i. e., those spoken by Jesus Christ during His corporeal life on Earth, because that translation lacked quotation marks. Other versions of the Bible have since adopted the popular practice.\n\n\n"}

It may be performed with or without emollient. Lomilomi practices vary by family, Ahupuaʻa (traditional region) and island.\n\nThroughout the Islands there is also a spiritual practice where spiritual healers, Kahuna and Shaman use traditional Lomi-Lomi to exorcise spirits (Aiku/Aitu) from possessed individuals.\n\nTraditionally in ancient Hawaii lomilomi was practiced in four contexts:\n\nAlthough the term \"kahuna lomilomi\" is widely used in contemporary writings, traditionally the people who performed lomilomi were called \"ka poe lomilomi\" (the massage people) or \"kanaka lomi\" (massage person). A related term, \"kauka lomilomi\", was coined in 1920 to describe osteopathic physicians. The word \"kauka\" is the Hawaiianized version of \"doctor\".\n\nFuture practitioners were selected in childhood, around age 5, based on birth signs such as weather events, birthmarks (especially on the head), and kind behavior. After a decade or more of study, they would begin to practice but mastery was believed to take a lifetime.\n\nLike all endeavors in old Hawaii, lomilomi was conducted with prayer and intention. \nHawaiian kupuna (elder) Auntie Margaret Machado describes lomilomi as \"praying\" work. Emma Akana Olmstead, a kupuna of Hana, Maui, in the 1930s, said, \"When a treatment is to be given, the one who gives the treatment first plucks the herbs to be used. He prays as he picks the herbs. No one should call him back or distract his attention, all should be as still as possible for they do not want the vibration broken. They knew the laws of vibration. They knew the power of the spoken word. They knew Nature. They gathered the vibration of the plentiful.\"\n\nThe early Polynesian settlers brought their own form of massage to Hawai'i and Hawaiian lomilomi evolved their own unique Hawaiian style, whilst neighbouring Polynesian Islands such as Tokelau, Samoa and Tahiti also developed their own forms of Lomilomi being practiced by everyone, from child to chief. As an indigenous practice that evolved over hundreds of years in isolated valleys throughout the island chain, there are many different \"schools\" of lomilomi with different approaches and techniques.\n\nAfter American missionaries arrived in 1820 and converted many in the Kingdom of Hawaii to Christianity, various laws prohibited \"heathen\" worship and any related Native Hawaiian healing practices. Lomilomi as part of medical practice went underground. But lomilomi as restorative massage remained popular not only among the Hawaiians, but among foreign residents and visitors as well. Charles Wilkes describes it being offered after his ascent of Mokuaweoweo in 1841 on the United States Exploring Expedition. For Robert Louis Stevenson it was \"disagreeable\", but English adventurer Isabella Bird found it delightful. Not only did non-Hawaiians receive lomilomi, they also gave it. According to William Brigham the first Director of the Bishop Museum, writing in 1908, one of the most skilled practitioners was Sanford Dole, one of the leaders of the overthrow of the Kingdom.\n\nAlthough the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii banned curing through \"superstitious methods\" in 1886, massage was not subject to legislation until 1945. In 1947, the Board of Massage was established to regulate lomilomi and massage. The law required practitioners to pass a written test on anatomy, physiology and massage theory. Many renowned native healers were unable or unwilling to pass the test, and thus lomilomi as restorative massage was forced underground. In 2001, the Legislature passed Act 304, amending HRS section 453, allowing native practitioners to be certified by the Hawaiian medical board, Papa Ola Lōkahi, or by the various community health centers. This law is controversial among some native practitioners, but those who are certified (but not licensed) can provide lomilomi without fear of prosecution under Hawaii state law.\n\nMany traditionally taught lomilomi practitioners find it virtually impossible to offer authentic lomilomi in a spa setting and are unwilling to work in most spas or massage offices. They prefer to treat selected clients quietly and privately, often in home settings. Lomilomi practitioners may also ask their clients to pray, meditate, change their diets, or take other action as part of their health improvement process. \n\nUnlike traditional lomilomi kupuna (elder) recognized by the Hawaiian community who require students to study with them for years, some massage schools around the world purport to train therapists in lomilomi in a few hours and some massage therapists may incorporate techniques from other massage modalities during the session. While often pleasant, this style of massage which is now a common and popular massage modality throughout the world, especially in Hawaii, Japan, Europe and Australia, is very different from authentic lomilomi.\n\n"}

Optional ingredients such as flavors, chopped dried fruit and chopped nuts are frequently added. Replacing the sugar with brown sugar results in a related confection called \"sea foam\".\n\nBelieved to have originated in the U.S. during the early 1900s, the candy's current form can be traced to a recipe from 1915. Another earlier version, which included the use of milk, can be traced to around 1907.\n\nOne proposed theory for its origins is that in the early 20th century, corn syrup (a major ingredient) was starting to be used as a popular sugar substitute. New recipes for its use were being frequently created by the major manufacturers, one of which may have been divinity.\n\nThe origins of the name are not clear. The most popular theory is simply that when first tasted, someone declared it to be, \"Divine!\" and the name stuck.\n\nDivinity has at times been referred to as a \"Southern candy\", most likely because of the frequent use of pecans in the recipe. It eventually made its way north, and today its recipe can be found in many cookbooks.\n\nHumidity during preparation can affect the quality of divinity. For a batch to be successful, the humidity must be low enough for the candy to dry properly.\n\nDue to the high amounts of sugar, divinity acts like a sponge. If the environment is very humid (over 50%) the candy will absorb moisture from the air, remaining gooey. Under the right conditions, it is a soft, white candy which should be dry to the touch.\n\nDivinity, like many other confections and baked goods, needs to have its recipe altered for high-altitude areas (over 3500 feet). One method is to reduce the temperature of the sugar mixture by about ten degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nIn the Peanuts comic strip in the 1960's, Linus Van Pelt was known to have an affinity for divinity, even being prepared to compliment his sister Lucy to have a piece.\n\nThe B-52's' song \"Give Me Back My Man\" features the line \"Throws Divinity on the sand\", as the narrator's attempt to entice a hungry shark into returning her man in exchange for the candy. This explanation is provided by Cindy Wilson in the book \"The B-52's Universe\" by Mats Sexton. The band, being from Athens, Georgia would be familiar with this Southern candy.\n\n"}

It is used by both Arab Muslims and Christians. In Islam, the word refers to the way of life Muslims must adopt to comply with divine law, encompassing beliefs, character and deeds. The term appears in the Quran 98 times with different connotations, including in the phrase \"yawm al-din\", generally translated as Day of Judgment. \n\nThe Arabic \"dīn\" has Semitic cognates, including the Hebrew \"dīn\" (דין), Aramaic \"dīnā\" (דִּינָא), Amharic \"dañä\" (ዳኘ) and Ugaritic \"dyn\" (𐎄𐎊𐎐). \n\nThe Arabic sense of judgment is commonly derived from the Hebraeo-Aramaic root. The Hebrew term \"דין\", transliterated as \"dīn\", means either \"law\" or \"judgement\". In the Kabbalah of Judaism, the term can, alongside \"Gevurah\" (cognate to the Arabic \"Jabaarah\"), refer to \"power\" and \"judgement\". In ancient Israel, the term featured heavily in administrative and legal proceedings i.e. Bet Din, literally \"the house of judgement,\" the ancient building block of the Jewish legal system. \n\nSome scholars such as Nöldeke and Vollers have derived the Arabic sense of religion from the Middle Persian \"den\" (revelation, religion) connected with the Zoroastrian notion \"daena\". Others, like Gaudefroy-Demombynes and Gardet, have found this derivation unconvincing.\n\nThe Arabic sense \"custom, usage\" has been derived by classical and modern lexicologists from the Arabic verbal forms \"dāna\" (be indebted) and \"dāna li-\" (submit to). Louis Gardet sees the Hebraic and Arabic senses as related through the notions of retribution, debt, obligation, custom, and direction, prompting him to translate \"yawn al-din\" as \"the day when God gives a direction to each human being\".\n\nIt has been said that the word \"Dīn\" appears in as many as 79 verses in the Qur'an, but because there is no exact English translation of the term, its precise definition has been the subject of some misunderstanding and disagreement. For instance, the term is often translated in parts of the Qur'an as \"religion\". However, in the Qur'an itself, the act of submission to God is always referred to as \"Dīn\" rather than as \"Madhhab\" (مذهب), which is the Arabic word for \"religion\".\n\nSome Qur'anic scholars have translated \"Dīn\" in places as \"faith\" Others suggest that the term \"has been used in various forms and meanings, e.g., system, power, supremacy, ascendancy, sovereignty or lordship, dominion, law, constitution, mastery, government, realm, decision, definite outcome, reward and punishment. On the other hand, this word is also used in the sense of obedience, submission and allegiance\".\n\nIn addition to the two broad usages referred to so far, of sovereignty on the one hand and submission on the other, others have noted that the term \"Dīn\" is also widely used in translations of the Qur'an in a third sense. Most famously in its opening chapter, al-Fātiḥah, the term is translated in almost all English translations as \"judgment\":\n\nThe well-known Islamic scholar, Fazlur Rahman Malik, suggested that Dīn is best considered as \"the way-to-be-followed\". In that interpretation, Dīn is the exact correlate of Shari'a: \"whereas Shari'a is the ordaining of the Way and its proper subject is God, Dīn is the following of that Way, and its subject is man\". Thus, \"if we abstract from the Divine and the human points of reference, Shari'a and Dīn would be identical as far as the 'Way' and its content are concerned\".\n\nIn many hadith, the din has been described as a midway lifestyle:\n\n"}

Some versions of the recipe also include chocolate, coffee or both.\n\nIts name, sometimes spelled \"banoffi\", is a portmanteau combining the words \"banana\" and \"toffee\".\n\nCredit for the pie's invention is claimed by Nigel Mackenzie and Ian Dowding, the owner and chef, respectively, of The Hungry Monk Restaurant in Jevington, East Sussex. They claim to have developed the dessert in 1971 by amending an unreliable American recipe for \"Blum’s Coffee Toffee Pie\" with a soft toffee made by boiling an unopened can of condensed milk for several hours. After trying various changes including the addition of apple or mandarin orange, Mackenzie suggested banana and Dowding later said that \"straight away we knew we had got it right\". Mackenzie suggested the name \"Banoffi Pie\", and the dish proved so popular with their customers that they \"couldn't take it off\" the menu.\n\nThe recipe was published in \"The Deeper Secrets of the Hungry Monk\" in 1974, and reprinted in the 1997 cookbook \"In Heaven with The Hungry Monk\". Dowding has stated that his \"pet hates are biscuit crumb bases and that horrible cream in aerosols\". It was Margaret Thatcher's favourite food to cook.\n\nThe recipe was adopted by many other restaurants throughout the world. In 1984, a number of supermarkets began selling it as an American pie, leading Nigel Mackenzie to offer a £10,000 prize to anyone who could disprove their claim to be the English inventors.\n\nThe word \"Banoffee\" entered the English language and became used to describe any food or product that tastes or smells of both banana and toffee. A recipe for the pie, using a biscuit crumb base, is often printed on tins of Nestlé's condensed milk, although that recipe calls for the contents of the tin to be boiled with additional butter and sugar instead of boiling the unopened tin - presumably for safety reasons.\n\nBanoffee pie was to have been served to U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at their March 2019 summit meeting, but was not when the meeting ended abruptly. \n\n"}

It was invented by Count Rumford circa 1800 and consumed in Munich and greater Bavaria, where he was employed as an advisor to the Duke. It was used as a ration for the poor, for Bavarian workhouses and military workhouses, and prisoners. Count Rumford has been credited in many instances for \"establishing the first real soup kitchen.\"\n\nAs a reformatory measure, the Bavarian government intended to institute workhouses for those on welfare. Rumford's charge was to provide the cheapest possible ration that was still a high-calorie, nutritious food. The soup came to be well-known among philanthropic-minded people throughout Germany at the time, and Rumford set up his soup kitchens in many German cities.\n\nRumford's soup was a common base for inexpensive military rations in Central Europe for much of the nineteenth and twentieth century. \n\nRumford's soup contained equal parts of pearl barley or barley meal and dried peas, vegetables, four parts potato, salt according to need, and sour beer, slowly boiled until thick. The use of potatoes came into use in later versions of the soup. It was typically eaten with bread. It has been stated that Rumford's recipe called for the bread to be served uncooked, and \"added just before serving the soup.\" One account describes the soup as being poured atop the bread just prior to serving. Rumford noted that the barley served to significantly thicken the soup and provide a richness to it, and he considered the cereal grain as \"the rice of Great Britain.\" Some versions were composed of cereals, minor amounts of meat and other ingredients. Not noted as particularly tasty, it is palatable with long, slow cooking.\n\nRumford's Soup was designed to provide a high degree of nutrition at a minimal expense. It has been estimated that the soup provided one-third of a person's minimal (daily) nutritional requirements. Rumford's soup is naturally low-fat, with high protein content from the dried peas, and both complex carbohydrates from the potato and barley and simple carbohydrates from the beer. Given the knowledge of the day, it was close to an optimum solution to the problem of creating cheap, nutritious food. Unfortunately, the need for vitamins and trace elements was unknown, but Rumford's soup was sometimes supplemented with corn or herring which supplied adequate Vitamin C and Vitamin D.\n\nThe soup is still served in contemporary times, such as at Oktoberfest celebrations in Munich.\n\n\n"}

The name describes the dish preparation itself which requires more ingredients (coconut milk, clove, lemongrass, cinnamon, and pandan leaf) than cooking common steamed rice and additional side dishes.\n\nNasi uduk is made by cooking rice soaked in coconut milk instead of water, along with clove, cassia bark, and lemongrass to add aroma. Sometimes knotted \"pandan\" leaves are thrown into the rice while steaming to give it more fragrance. The coconut milk and spices imparts an oily, rich taste to the rice. \"Bawang goreng\" (fried shallots) is sprinkled on top of the rice before serving. Other dishes are usually served as side dishes. Pre-packed nasi uduk are commonly wrapped in a cone-shaped banana leaf.\n\nNasi uduk sold in \"warung\" or other eating establishments are commonly offered with assortment of side dishes, chosen by the client. The pre-packed basic nasi uduk usually consists of \"tempe orek\" (tempeh stir fried with sweet soy sauce), \"teri kacang\" (anchovy with peanuts), and shredded omelette, with \"sambal kacang\" (peanut sambal).\n\nSide dishes offered with nasi uduk are:\n\nThe most common type of sambal that usually served with nasi uduk is \"sambal kacang\" (peanut sambal); it is optional as a condiment.\n\nNasi uduk is a popular dish for the busy commuters in Jakarta, mainly because it is affordable (one serving costs on average Rp10,000 or about US$0.77). It can be found throughout the day; some roadside stalls open exclusively in the morning, noon, or night, depending on the demographics of the surrounding area. Stalls near residential areas, marketplaces, train stations, and schools are usually open from morning to noon, while the ones near offices and street-side are usually open afternoon to midnight.\n\nEach neighbourhood in Jakarta has its own variant of the dish, the most notable being \"Nasi uduk Slipi\" from West Jakarta. Kebon Kacang area near Tanah Abang in Central Jakarta is renowned for its nasi uduk.\n\nThe dish is known as \"berkat\" (literally: \"blessing\") in Suriname.

It is also a byproduct of soup soy sauce production. It is sometimes used as a relish.\n\nThe earliest soybean fermentations in Korea seem to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms. The \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", a Chinese historical text written and published in the third century AD, mentions that \"Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soybeans\" in the section named \"Dongyi\" (Eastern foreigners), in the \"Book of Wei\". Jangdoks used for doenjang production are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No.3 from the 4th century Goguryeo.\n\nIn \"Samguk Sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is written that \"doenjang\" and \"ganjang\" along with \"meju\" and \"jeotgal\" were prepared for the wedding ceremony of the King Sinmun in February 683. \"Sikhwaji\", a section from \"Goryeosa\" (History of Goryeo), recorded that \"doenjang\" and \"ganjang\" were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as \"Guhwangchwaryo\" and \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\" contain detailed procedures on how to brew good-quality \"doenjang\" and \"ganjang\". \"Gyuhap chongseo\" explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve \"doenjang\" and \"ganjang\".\n\n\"Doenjang\" is made entirely of fermented soybean and brine. Soup soy sauce is also made during the \"doenjang\" production.\n\n\"Meju\", Korean soybean brick, is made around \"ipdong\" in early November. Soybeans are soaked overnight, boiled in salt water, and then pounded in a mortar (\"jeolgu\") or coarsely ground in a millstone. About a \"doe\" (≈1.8 litres) or two \"doe\"s of pounded soybean is chunked, compressed, and shaped into a cube or a sphere called \"meju\". The \"meju\" bricks are then dried in a cool, shaded area for a week to several weeks until firm. When the bricks harden, they are tied with rice straws to the eaves of the house, or put in the warm ondol room with rice straws, for fermentation. In Jeongwol, the first month of the lunar year, well-fermented \"meju\" bricks are washed and sun-dried.\n\nAfter drying, the \"meju\" bricks are aged in onggi crocks (jangdok) with brine. Charcoal and chillies are added for their absorbent and antibacterial properties, as well as folk-religious beliefs that they drive evil spirits away. When fermented well, the aged \"meju\" chunks are mashed to become \"doenjang\", and the filtrate is boiled to become \"ganjang\".\n\nThough \"doenjang\" and \"ganjang\" are usually made together, \"doenjang\" can also be made without producing any filtrate.\n\n\nWhile traditional \"doenjang\" is made with soybeans and brine only, many factory-made variants of \"doenjang\" contain a fair amount of wheat flour just like most factory-made soy sauce does. Some current makers also add fermented, dried, and ground anchovies to accentuate \"doenjang\"'s savory flavor. Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's \"Food Code\" classifies \"doenjang\" into three categories by their ingredients.\n\n\n\"Doenjang\" can be eaten as a condiment in raw-paste form with vegetables, as flavored seasoning or even as a dipping condiment. However, it is more commonly mixed with garlic, sesame oil, and sometimes \"gochujang\" to produce \"ssamjang\", which is then traditionally eaten with or without rice wrapped in leaf vegetables such as red leaf lettuce. This dish is called \"ssambap\". This combination of leaf vegetable and \"doenjang\" (or \"ssamjang\") often complements popular Korean meat dishes, for example \"samgyeopsal\", \"bulgogi\", \"bibimbap\" and \"bossam\".\n\nIt can also be used as a component of soup broth, for example in a popular stew (\"jjigae\") called \"doenjang jjigae\" which usually includes tofu, various vegetables such as chile peppers, zucchini, and scallion, and (optionally) mushrooms, red meat, or scallops.\n\n\"Doenjang\" is rich in flavonoids and beneficial vitamins, minerals, and plant hormones (phytoestrogens) which are sometimes claimed to possess anticarcinogenic properties. In Korean traditional meals, the menu has concentrated on vegetables and rice, but \"doenjang\", which is made of soybeans, has a great deal of lysine, an essential amino acid that rice lacks. Linoleic acid (53% of the fatty acids) and linolenic acid (8% of the fatty acids) have an important role in normal growth of blood vessels and prevention of blood vessel-related illness. \"Doenjang\"'s efficacy still exists after boiling, in dishes such as \"doenjang jjigae\".\n\n\"Doenjang\" is considered one of the essential sauces of authentic Korean cuisine. However, the condiment has historically been unknown outside of Korea, although recent international articles have resulted in an increase in its popularity. A 2007 Chinese article on the \"Sauces of Korea\" listed \"doenjang\" and \"gochujang\" as essential flavorings, and explored the origins of the condiments, particularly focusing on Sunchang County, where most Korean soy sauce is produced. The article pointed out that \"doenjang\" does not contain any artificial additives and in fact has healthy amounts of essential vitamins, such as vitamin C and vitamin B. The health benefits of \"doenjang\" are rumored to extend longevity, and this is illustrated by the fact that out of the 32,000 people in Sunchung County, eight are over 100 years old, and many are over 90. The article was influential throughout China, resulting in many Chinese restaurants adding \"doenjang jjigae\" modified slightly to Chinese tastes, to their menus shortly after publication. South Korea's \"JoongAng Ilbo\" covered this story in China on December 13, 2007.\n\nClaims are being explored about the role of \"doenjang\" in reducing visceral fat, though most studies have only been done on rodents. However, one study on humans does exist, which suggests that its visceral fat reduction properties are also present in humans.\n\nA very similar fermented soybean paste in northeast China is known as \"dajiang\". The tradition of eating \"dajiang\" is said to have been started by the Manchu people, who originally occupied China's northeastern provinces. Northeastern Chinese people enjoy eating raw vegetables in the summer, and \"dajiang\" is used like a salad dressing to add flavor. Northern Chinese yellow soybean paste also bears a great similarity in texture and taste to Korean \"doenjang\".\n\nDoenjang also bears similarities to Japanese \"miso\", although miso is fermented with a fungus (\"Aspergillus oryzae\") and \"doenjang\" is fermented with a bacterial culture (\"Aspergillus oryzae\" and \"Bacillus subtilis\").\n\n\"Doenjang jjigae\" was the basis of a Korean movie called \"The Recipe\", released in 2010. It was about a death-row inmate who makes his last wish for a bowl of the stew.\n\n\"\"Doenjang\" girl\" is a popular term for women who indulge in luxurious products to show off, despite not being able to afford them.\n\n\n"}

They are also kosher. \n\nAlthough originally marketed as being otherwise, the current incarnations of Munchos are actually thinner than most potato chips, to the point of being slightly transparent and containing air pockets. When first introduced, they were positioned as \"a potato snack, thicker than potato chips.\" Their slightly curved shape and rough texture assist with dipping. Ingredients include dehydrated potatoes, corn and/or sunflower oil, corn meal, potato starch, salt, \"sulfate\", \"niacin\", \"thiamin mononitrate\", \"riboflavin\", and yeast.\n\nIn 1969, a 7.25oz., bag which sold for 59 cents retail is now sold——for $2 to $3.29, and .99 for the 4.25 oz., \"Big Grab\".

Lay's Stax, a similar snack to Pringles, also marketed itself as \"potato crisps\".\n\nAn ad campaign in 1969 included the phrase, \"It's MUNCHOS!\" spoken in a high-pitched voice.

In Middle Persian the term became \"yazad\" or \"yazd\", pl. \"yazdān\", continuing in New Persian as \"izad\".\n\nRelated terms in other languages are Sanskrit \"yájati\" \"he worships, he sacrifices\", \"yajatá-\" \"worthy of worship, holy\", \"yajñá\" \"sacrifice\", and perhaps also Greek ἅγιος \"hagios\" \"devoted to the gods, sacred, holy\".\n\nThe term \"yazata\" is already used in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. In these hymns, \"yazata\" is used as a generic, applied to Ahura Mazda as well as to the \"divine sparks\", that in later tradition are the Amesha Spentas. In the Gathas, the \"yazata\"s are effectively what the \"daeva\"s are not; that is, the \"yazata\"s are to be worshipped while the \"daeva\"s are to be rejected.\n\nThe Gathas also collectively invoke the \"yazata\"s without providing a clue as to which entities are being invoked, and—given the structure and language of the hymns—it is generally not possible to determine whether these \"yazata\"s are abstract concepts or are manifest entities. Amongst the lesser Yazatas being invoked by name by the poet of the Gathas are Sraosha, Ashi, Geush Tashan, Geush Urvan, Tushnamaiti, and Iza, and all of which \"win mention in his hymns, it seems, because of their close association with rituals of sacrifice and worship\".\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, the \"yazata\"s are unambiguously divine, with divine powers but performing mundane tasks such as serving as charioteers for other \"yazata\"s. Several \"yazata\"s are given anthropomorphic attributes, such as cradling a mace or bearing a crown upon their heads, or not letting sleep interrupt their vigil against the demons.\n\nAt some point during the late 5th or early 4th century BCE, the Achaemenids instituted a religious calendar in which each day of the month was named after, and placed under the protection of, a particular \"yazata\". These day-name dedications were not only of religious significance because they ensured that those divinities remained in the public consciousness, they also established a hierarchy among the \"yazata\"s, with specific exalted entities having key positions in the day-name dedications (see Zoroastrian calendar for details).\n\nAlthough these day-name dedications are mirrored in scripture, it cannot be determined whether these day-name assignments were provoked by an antecedent list in scripture (e.g. \"Yasna\" 16), or whether the day-name dedications provoked the compilation of such lists. Relatively certain however is that the day-name dedications predate the Avesta's \"Siroza\" (\"30 days\"), which contain explicit references to the \"yazata\"s as protectors/guardians of their respective days of the month.\n\nThe 9th–12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition observe the \"yazata\"s (by then as Middle Persian \"yazad\"s) in much the same way as the hymns of the Younger Avesta. In addition, in roles that are only alluded to in scripture, they assume characteristics of cosmological or eschatological consequence.\n\nFor instance, Aredvi Sura Anahita (\"Ardvisur Nahid\") is both a divinity of the waters as well as a rushing world river that encircles the earth, which is blocked up by Angra Mainyu (\"Ahriman\") thus causing drought. The blockage is removed by Verethragna (\"Vahram\"), and Tishtrya (\"Tir\") gathers up the waters and spreads them over the earth (Zam) as rain. In stories with eschatological significance, Sraosha (\"Sarosh\"), Mithra (\"Mihr\"), and Rashnu (\"Rashn\") are guardians of the Chinvat bridge, the bridge of the separator, across which all souls must pass.\n\nFurther, what the calendrical dedications had begun, the tradition completed: at the top of the hierarchy was Ahura Mazda, who was supported by the great heptad of Amesha Spentas (\"Ameshaspand\"s/\"Mahraspand\"s), through which the Creator realized (\"created with his thought\") the manifest universe. The Amesha Spentas in turn had \"hamkars\" \"assistants\" or \"cooperators\", each a caretaker of one facet of creation.\n\nIn both tradition and scripture, the terms 'Amesha Spenta' and 'yazata' are sometimes used interchangeably. In general, however, 'Amesha Spenta' signifies the six great \"divine sparks\". In tradition, \"yazata\" is the first of the 101 epithets of Ahura Mazda. The word also came to be applied to Zoroaster, but Zoroastrians to this day remain sharply critical of any attempts to deify the prophet. In a hierarchy that does not include either Ahura Mazda or the Amesha Spentas amongst the \"yazatas\", the most prominent amongst those \"worthy of worship\" is Mithra, who \"is second only in dignity to Ohrmazd (i.e. Ahura Mazda) himself.\"\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, the linguist Martin Haug interpreted Zoroastrian scripture in Christian terms, and compared the \"yazata\"s to the angels of Christianity. In this scheme, the Amesha Spentas are the arch-angel retinue of Ahura Mazda, with the \"hamkars\" as the supporting host of lesser angels.\n\nAt the time Haug wrote his translations, the Parsi (i.e. Indian Zoroastrian) community was under intense pressure from English and American missionaries, who severely criticized the Zoroastrians for—as John Wilson portrayed it in 1843—\"polytheism\", which the missionaries argued was much less worth than their own \"monotheism\". At the time, Zoroastrianism lacked theologians of its own, and so the Zoroastrians were poorly equipped to make their own case. In this situation, Haug's counter-interpretation came as a welcome relief, and was (by-and-large) gratefully accepted as legitimate.\n\nHaug's interpretations were subsequently disseminated as Zoroastrian ones, which then eventually reached the west where they were seen to corroborate Haug. Like most of Haug's interpretations, this comparison is today so well entrenched that a gloss of 'yazata' as 'angel' is almost universally accepted; both in publications intended for a general audience as well as in (non-philological) academic literature.\n\nAmongst the Muslims of Islamic Iran, Sraosha came to be \"arguably the most popular of all the subordinate Yazatas\", for as the angel Surush, only he (of the entire Zoroastrian pantheon) is still venerated by name.\n"}

The word in English may refer to any of various clergy, depending upon the usage of the particular church in question.\n\nProtodeacon is an honorific rank given to certain married deacons in Eastern Christian churches. In the Russian Orthodox Church it is an honorary title given to married deacons, as a mark of which, the clergyman is entitled to wear a burgundy-colored skufia. The equivalent rank for Hierodeacons—i.e., monastic deacons—is Archdeacon. The senior deacon of a cathedral or principal church may be awarded the title of protodeacon. In the Greek usage, the chief deacon who is attached to the person of a bishop is called an archdeacon. In the Slavic usage a protodeacon or archdeacon wears a distinctive orarion (deacon's stole). \n\nThe title of protodeacon is an award, not a distinctive order of ministry; so while a man may be ordained a deacon, he is said to be 'elevated' to the rank of protodeacon. This elevation may be awarded only by the deacon's own ruling bishop. The rite of elevation is identical for both a protodeacon and an archdeacon, and is normally done during the Little Entrance of the Divine Liturgy. \n\nA protodeacon has precedence when serving with other deacons, regardless of the date of his own ordination to the diaconate. If several protodeacons serve at the same time, their order of precedence is determined by the date of their elevation.\n\nIn the \"Archieratikon\" (Slavonic: \"Chinovnik\"), the liturgical book containing the services as celebrated by a bishop, the term Protodeacon is used to refer to the senior-ranking deacon who is serving, regardless of whether or not he has actually had that rank bestowed upon him.\n\nIn the Roman rite, the senior Cardinal Deacon is the Cardinal Protodeacon of the Holy Roman Church. He has the privilege of announcing the new Pope's election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate) in the Habemus Papam announcement given from the central balcony at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City State. In the past, during papal coronations, the Proto-Deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon's privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased. However, the Proto-Deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. “Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.” The current Cardinal Proto-Deacon is Renato Martino.\n\n"}

Childbirth in Nepal also results in confinement. During this time, women and girls are restricted from participating in everyday life events, and from interacting with their communities.\n\nThe practice of chhaupadi originates from the superstition that menstruation causes women to be temporarily impure, based on the myth that Indra created menstruation as a means to distribute a curse. In this logic, it is believed that if a menstruating woman touches a tree, it will never again bear fruit; if she consumes milk, the cow will not give any more milk; if she reads a book, Saraswati, the goddess of education, will become angry; if she touches a man, he will be ill.\n\nThe practice persists in rural areas primarily in Western Nepal. It is also called ‘chhue’ or ‘bahirhunu’ in Dadeldhura, Baitadi and Darchula, as ‘chhaupadi’ in Achham, and as ‘chaukulla’ or ‘chaukudi’ in Bajhang district.\n\nThe tradition begins with an adolescent girl's first menstrual cycle, in which she remains in the shed for up to fourteen days; afterwards, she must spend the duration of each monthly period in the shed, until she reaches menopause. Additionally, women who have just given birth must stay in the shed with their child for up to two weeks. \n\nMenstruating women and girls are required to remain isolated from their family, and are forbidden from entering homes, kitchens, schools, and temples. During this time, they remain in what is often a menstruation hut, usually made from wood or stone. In some locations, women may stay isolated from their family in a separate room attached to the house, such as a shed used for storing tools. Furnishings are sparse, often women sleep on the floor with only a small rug for warmth. They may not touch family members, especially male family members, and food and water is passed to them in a way as so to prevent touching. They are also restricted from participating in family, religious or social functions, such as attending the temple or going to weddings, and girls are prevented from going to school. \n\nThey are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and other nutritious foods, for fear that their impurity will cause cows to become ill. The typical diet during menstruation are dry foods, salt, and rice. They are barred from using community water sources or performing daily functions like bathing or washing clothing. \n\nDespite the social isolation of chhaupadi, women must still work, often fieldwork, during menstruation.\n\nWomen are exposed to multiple health and safety risks while practising chhaupadi.\n\nHuts are often poorly constructed, lacking heat or ventilation, leaving women essentially outside to the elements and extreme temperatures during different times of year. Women are at risk of developing illnesses such as pneumonia or diarrhea while practising, as well as being open to attack by snakes and other animals. Risk of asphyxiation is high if the woman starts a fire in the hut to keep warm during the winter. Women have been raped while practising chhaupadi.\n\nWhile exact numbers are not available, women and girls die annually while performing the practice. Particularly in the far and mid-western regions of Nepal, a number of deaths have been directly related to the use of these huts. Causes range from being attacked by animals, to being bitten by scorpions or snakes, to illnesses from exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity and organizational actions exist to combat the practice. In January 2019, local authorities demanded the destruction of chhaupadi huts in Bajura, the municipality in which a woman and her two young sons died in a hut, resulting in the removal of 60 of the sheds, and deploying law enforcement to patrol for further removal. \nChhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, but the tradition has been slow to change. In 2017, Nepal passed a law punishing people who force women into exile during menstruating with up to three months in jail or a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees, however, five months after the new law went into effect (in August 2018), no cases were filed against those forcing the practice. In late 2018, district governments in the far west of the country began denying state support services to citizens still forcing the practice of chhaupadi, in an effort to reduce the practice.\n\n"}
{"id": "2369916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2369916", "title": "Chuño", "text": "Chuño\n\nChuño () is a freeze-dried potato product traditionally made by Quechua and Aymara communities of Bolivia and Peru, and is known in various countries of South America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. It is a five-day process, obtained by exposing a frost-resistant variety of potatoes to the very low night temperatures of the Andean Altiplano, freezing them, and subsequently exposing them to the intense sunlight of the day (this being the traditional process). The word comes from Quechua \"ch'uñu\", meaning 'frozen potato' ('wrinkled' in the dialects of the Junín Region).\n\nThe existence of chuño dates back to before the time of the Inca Empire in the 13th century, based on findings that have been made of the product at various archaeological sites. Specifically, they have been found at Tiwanaku, site of a culture which developed in the Collao Plateau, a geographic zone which includes territories of Bolivia and Peru.\n\nIt had been described in 1590 by Spanish chronicler José de Acosta. Due to its portability, long shelf life, and nutritional value, chuño was eaten by Inca soldiers on marches. Indeed Carl Troll argued that the nighttime sub-freezing temperatures of southern Peruvian highlands that allowed for chuño production favoured the rise of the Inca Empire.\n\nChuño is made during June and July, during which time the temperatures reach around at elevations of over . After harvest, potatoes are selected for the production of chuño, typically small ones for ease of processing. These small potatoes are spread closely on flat ground, and allowed to freeze with the low night temperatures and dehydrate in the daytime, for about three nights. This process results in natural freeze-drying.\n\nBy the end of this process, usually around May, the potatoes are taken to \"chuñochinapampas\" – flat areas where the potatoes can be laid out. The term is Aymara in origin and translates to “the place where the chuño is made”. Once they make it to the \"chuñochinapampas,\" they are trampled by foot. This eliminates what little water is still retained by the potatoes, and removes the skins, enabling subsequent freezing and drying. They remain as they are for over a week, depending on weather conditions.\n\nDuring the process of manually squeezing water out of the potatoes via stepping on them, whole families will participate. The previous freeze-drying breaks down cell walls, making it easier to remove water from the potatoes. They build a small pile of potatoes with their feet and then \"dance\" on the pile, removing the skins as they do so. This will not entirely remove the skins, so the remaining skin is removed by hand afterwards.\n\nStarting from this basic freeze-dry process, two varieties are obtained:\n\nWhite chuño is obtained by washing the frozen potatoes. The washing may take various forms. In Bolivia , the potatoes are spread on blankets or straw and constantly sprayed with water to moisten. In Peru, the frozen potatoes are transported to a river, and deposited in pools. This washing typically takes about a week. The final step is drying in the sun. The result is now called chuño, also known as \"papas secas\". In Bolivia, white chuño is also called \"tunta\".\n\nBlack chuño is obtained directly from the original freezing, trampling, and refreezing process. The product is not washed or exposed to water again; after freezing and trampling, it is simply sun-dried. Black chuño production has less regional variation than white chuño, and is more likely to be kept and consumed by farmers than the more commercialized white chuño.\n\nOnce dried, and with minimal care in storage, the product can last for a very long time, sometimes decades.\n\nConsumption is varied, from desserts to prepared dishes, as well as chuño flour, which is an essential ingredient in many dishes of Peruvian cuisine. Chairo is one of the most traditional Bolivian soups and it is made with chuño, meat, and vegetables. Especially in Bolivia, chuño is not considered the same as a regular potato. In certain recipes, chuño and potatoes should not be used interchangeably. \"Chairo\", for example, is not considered the same without the ground chuño. The other ingredients - wheat, carrots, etc - can be substituted, but not the chuño. It is also traditional in southern regions of Peru such as Arequipa and Puno. Another soup, this one made using whole chuño, is \"jakonta\". More simply, chuño can be eaten with a variety of sauces.\n\n"}
{"id": "2371591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2371591", "title": "Multiple frequency-shift keying", "text": "Multiple frequency-shift keying\n\nMultiple frequency-shift keying (MFSK) is a variation of frequency-shift keying (FSK) that uses more than two frequencies. MFSK is a form of M-ary orthogonal modulation, where each symbol consists of one element from an alphabet of orthogonal waveforms. M, the size of the alphabet, is usually a power of two so that each symbol represents logM bits.\n\nIn a M-ary signaling system like MFSK, an \"alphabet\" of M tones is established and the transmitter selects one tone at a time from the alphabet for transmission. M is usually a power of 2, so each tone transmission from the alphabet represents log M data bits.\n\nMFSK is classed as an M-ary orthogonal signaling scheme because each of the M tone detection filters at the receiver responds only to its tone and not at all to the others; this independence provides the orthogonality.\n\nLike other M-ary orthogonal schemes, the required E/N ratio\nfor a given probability of error decreases as M increases without the need for multisymbol coherent detection. In fact, as M approaches infinity the required E/N ratio decreases asymptotically to the Shannon limit of −1.6dB. However this decrease is slow with increasing M, and large values are impractical because of the exponential increase in required bandwidth. Typical values in practice range from 4 to 64, and MFSK is combined with another forward error correction scheme to provide additional (systematic) coding gain.\n\nLike any other form of angle modulation that transmits a single RF tone that varies only in phase or frequency, MFSK produces a constant envelope. This significantly relaxes the design of the RF power amplifier, allowing it to achieve greater conversion efficiencies than linear amplifiers.\n\nIt is possible to combine two MFSK systems to increase the throughput of the link. Perhaps the most widely used 2-tone MFSK system is dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF), better known by its AT&T trademark of \"Touch Tone\". Another is the Multi-frequency (MF) scheme used during the 20th century for in-band signalling on trunks between telephone exchanges. Both are examples of in-band signaling schemes, i.e., they share the user's communication channel.\n\nSymbols in the DTMF and MF alphabets are sent as tone pairs; DTMF selects one tone from a \"high\" group and one from a \"low\" group, while MF selects its two tones from a common set. DTMF and MF use different tone frequencies largely to keep end users from interfering with inter-office signaling. In the 1970s, MF began to be replaced by digital out-of-band signaling, a conversion motivated in part by the widespread fraudulent use of MF signals by end users known as phone phreaks.\n\nThese signals are distinctive when received aurally as a rapid succession of tone pairs with almost musical quality.\n\nThe simultaneous transmission of two tones directly at RF loses the constant-envelope property of the single tone system. Two simultaneous RF tones is in fact the classic \"stress test\" of an RF power amplifier for measuring linearity and intermodulation distortion. However, two audio tones can be sent simultaneously on a conventional, constant-envelope FM RF carrier, but the noncoherent detection of the FM signal at the receiver would destroy any signal-to-noise ratio advantage the multitone scheme might have.\n\nSkywave propagation on the high frequency bands introduces random distortions that generally vary with both time and frequency. Understanding these impairments helps one understand why MFSK is such an effective and popular technique on HF.\n\nWhen several separate paths from transmitter to receiver exist, a condition known as multipath, they almost never have exactly the same length so they almost never exhibit the same propagation delay. Small delay differences, or delay spread, smear adjacent modulation symbols together and cause unwanted intersymbol interference.\n\nDelay spread is inversely proportional to its frequency-domain counterpart, coherence bandwidth. This is the frequency range over which the channel gain is relatively constant. This is because summing two or more paths with different delays creates a comb filter even when the individual paths have a flat frequency response.\n\nFading is a (usually random and undesired) change in path gain with time. The maximum fade rate is limited by the physics of the channel, such as the rate at which free electrons form and are recombined in the ionosphere and charged particle cloud velocities within the ionosphere. The maximum interval over which the channel gain does not appreciably change is the coherence time.\n\nA fading channel effectively imposes an unwanted random amplitude modulation on the signal. Just as the bandwidth of intentional AM increases with the modulation rate, fading spreads a signal over a frequency range that increases with the fading rate. This is Doppler spreading, the frequency domain counterpart of coherence time. The shorter the coherence time, the greater the Doppler spread and vice versa.\n\nWith appropriate parameter selection, MFSK can tolerate significant Doppler or delay spreads, especially when augmented with forward error correction. (Mitigating large amounts of Doppler \"and\" delay spread is significantly more challenging, but it is still possible). A long delay spread with little Doppler spreading can be mitigated with a relatively long MFSK symbol period to allow the channel to \"settle down\" quickly at the start of each new symbol. Because a long symbol contains more energy than a short one for a given transmitter power, the detector can more easily attain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resultant throughput reduction can be partly compensated with a large tone set so that each symbol represents several data bits; a long symbol interval allows these tones to be packed more closely in frequency while maintaining orthogonality. This is limited by the exponential growth of tone set size with the number of data bits/symbol.\n\nConversely, if the Doppler spread is large while the delay spread is small, then a shorter symbol period may permit coherent tone detection and the tones must be spaced more widely to maintain orthogonality.\n\nThe most challenging case is when the delay and Doppler spreads are both large, i.e., the coherence bandwidth and coherence time are both small. This is more common on auroral and EME channels than on HF, but it can occur. A short coherence time limits the symbol time, or more precisely, the maximum coherent detection interval at the receiver. If the symbol energy is too small for an adequate per-symbol detection SNR, then one alternative is transmit a symbol longer than the coherence time but to detect it with a filter much\nwider than one matched to the transmitted symbol. (The filter should instead be matched to the tone spectrum expected at the receiver). This will capture much of the symbol energy despite Doppler spreading, but it will necessarily do so inefficiently. A wider tone spacing, i.e., a wider channel, is also required. Forward error correction is especially helpful in this case.\n\nBecause of the wide variety of conditions found on HF, a wide variety of MFSK schemes, some of them experimental, have been developed for HF. Some of them are:\n\n\nPiccolo was the original MFSK mode, developed for British government communications by Harold Robin, Donald Bailey and Denis Ralphs of the Diplomatic Wireless Service (DWS), a branch of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It was first used in 1962 and presented to the IEE in 1963. The current specification \"Piccolo Mark IV\" was still in limited use by the UK government, mainly for point-to-point military radio communications, up to the late 1990s.\n\nCoquelet is a similar modulation system developed by the French government for similar applications.\n\nMFSK8 and MFSK16 were developed by Murray Greenman, ZL1BPU for amateur radio communications on HF. Olivia MFSK is also an amateur radio mode. Greenman has also developed DominoF and DominoEX for NVIS radio communications on the upper MF and lower HF frequencies (1.8–7.3 MHz).\n\nAutomatic link establishment (ALE) is a protocol developed by the USA military and used mainly as an automatic signalling system between radios. It is used extensively for military and government communications worldwide and by radio amateurs.It is standardized as MIL-STD-188-141B, which succeeded the older version MIL-STD-188-141A.\n\n\"CIS-36 MFSK\" or \"CROWD-36\" () is the western designation of a system similar to Piccolo developed in the former Soviet Union for military communications. \n\n\"XPA\" and \"XPA2\" are ENIGMA-2000 designations for polytonic tranismissions, reportedly originating from Russian Intelligence and Foreign Ministry stations. Recently the system was also described as \"MFSK-20\".\n\nMFSK modes used for VHF, UHF communications:\n\nFSK441, JT6M and JT65 are parts of the WSJT family or radio modulation systems, developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, for long distance amateur radio VHF communications under marginal propagation conditions. These specialized MFSK modulation systems are used over troposcattering, EME (earth-moon-earth) and meteoscattering radio paths.\n\nPI4 is a digital mode specifically designed for VUSHF beacon and propagation studies. The mode was developed as part of the Next Generation Beacons project among others used by the oldest amateur beacon in the world OZ7IGY. A decoder for PI4 is available in the PI-RX program developed by Poul-Erik Hansen, OZ1CKG.\n\nDTMF was initially developed for telephone line signaling.

The dish is similar to chicken à la Provençale, but with the addition of egg and crayfish, which are traditional to Chicken Marengo but are now often omitted. The original dish was named to celebrate the Battle of Marengo, a Napoleonic victory of June 1800.\n\nAccording to a popular myth, the dish was first made after Napoleon defeated the Austrian army at the Battle of Marengo at Marengo south of Alessandria, Italy, when his chef Dunand foraged in the town for ingredients (because the supply wagons were too distant) and created the dish from what he could gather. According to this legend, Napoleon enjoyed the dish so much he had it served to him after every battle, and when Dunand was later better-supplied and substituted mushrooms for crayfish and added wine to the recipe, Napoleon refused to accept it, believing that a change would bring him bad luck.\n\nThis colorful story, however, is probably myth; Alan Davidson writes that there would have been no access to tomatoes at that time, and the first published recipe for the dish omits them. The more plausible explanation for the origin of the dish is that it was created by a restaurant chef to honor Napoleon's victory.\n\nPellegrino Artusi's classic recipe in his \"Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well\" is as follows (note the lack of tomatoes, crayfish and eggs):\n\n"}

A representation term is commonly referred to as a \"class word\" by those familiar with data dictionaries. ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 defines \"representation term\" as a \"designation of an instance of a representation class\" As used in ISO/IEC 11179, the representation term is that part of a data element name that provides a semantic pointer to the underlying data type. A \"Representation class\" is a class of representations. This \"representation class\" provides a way to classify or group data elements.\n\nA \"Representation Term\" may be thought of as an attribute of a data element in a metadata registry that classifies the data element according to the type of data stored in the data element.\n\nRepresentation terms are typically \"approved\" by the organization or standards body using them. For example, the UN publishes its approved list as part of the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification. The Universal Data Element Framework uses a subset of CCTS representation terms and assigns numeric codes to those used.\n\nA value domain expresses the set of allowed values for a data element. The representation term (and typically the corresponding data type term) comprise a taxonomy for the value domains within a data set. This taxonomy is the representation class. Thus the representation term can be used to control proliferation of value domains by ensuring equivalent value domains use the same representation term.\n\nWhen a person or software agent is analyzing two separate metadata registries to find property equivalence, the Representation Term can be used as a guide. For example, if system A has a Data Element such as PersonGenderCode and system B has a data element such as PersonSexCode the code suffix might assist the two systems to only match data elements that have the suffix \"Code\". However, a taxonomy of property terms (i.e. \"Sex\" or \"Gender\") is much more efficient in this respect.\n\nThe Representation Term can be used in many ways to do inferences on data sets. Representation Terms tells the observer of any data stream about the data types and gives an indication of how the Data Element can be used. This is critical when mapping metadata registries to external Data Elements. For example, if you are sent a record about a person you may look for any \"ID\" suffix to understand how the remote system may differentiate two distinct records.\n\nRepresentation Terms are also used to make inferences about the requirements of a property. For example, if a data stream had Data Element PersonBirthDateAndTime you would know that BOTH the date AND time are available and relevant, not just the date. If the birth time was optional, a separate data elements should be used such as PersonBirthDate and PersonBirthTime.\n\nWhen creating a data warehouse, a business analyst looks at the Representation Terms to quickly find the dimensions and measures of a subject matter in order to build OLAP cubes. For example:\n\n\nThe joint ISO/UN Core Components Technical Specification formally define both the allowed set of representation terms and the corresponding set of data types. ISO 15000-5 is an implementation layer of ISO 11179 and normatively expresses a set of rules to semantically define conceptual and physical/logical data models for a wide variety of uses. In ISO 15000-5, the representation term provides a mechanism to harmonize the value domains of candidate data elements before being added to the overall data model(s). ISO 15000-5 is being used by a number of government, standards development organizations, and private sector as the basis for data modeling.\n\nSome informal standards such as the Universal Data Element Framework (which refer to a Representation Term as a \"Property Word\") assign unique integer IDs to each Representation Term. This allows metadata mapping tools to map one set of data elements into other metadata vocabularies. An example of these mappings can be found at Property word ID. Note that as of November 2005 the UDEF concepts have not been widely adopted.\n\nFor example, if an XML Data fragment had the following:\n\nIn the example above, the Representation terms are \"ID\" for the <PersonID>, the suffix \"Name\" for the Given and Family names, and \"Date\" for the <PersonBirthDate>.\n\nThe following are samples of Representation Terms that have been used for the exchange of electronic messages in systems such as NIEM or GJXDM 3.0: [note: the restrictions expressed here are limited to those specifications and do not represent universal consensus]\n\n\n\n[Note] This is an extremely limited set of the wide range of standards that specify the use of representation terms.\n\n\n\n"}

The field of vascular medicine (angiology) is the field that deals with preventing, diagnosing and treating vascular and blood vessel related diseases.\n\nArterial diseases include the aorta (aneurysms/dissection) and arteries supplying the legs, hands, kidneys, brain, intestines. It also covers arterial thrombosis and embolism; vasculitides; and vasospastic disorders. Naturally, it deals with preventing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Venous diseases include venous thrombosis, chronic venous insufficiency, and varicose veins. Lymphatic diseases include primary and secondary forms of lymphedema. It also involves modification of risk factors for vascular disease like high cholesterol, high blood pressure.\n\nCardiovascular risk factors such high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and others fall under the specialty of vascular medicine. Hence, a vascular medicine specialist should be able to address most of the major diseases in our age in a comprehensive manner, using a unique perspective.\n\nIn Europe, vascular medicine (angiology) training is well established in some European countries. The first European educational Working Group was born in 1991 in Milan (EWMA)becoming in 1998 a European Scientific Association VAS Vascular Independent Research and Education European Organization with several European educational programmes:European Felloship, European Master, CESMA-UEMS European Diploma and Postgrad Courses.

They are part of the hadron particle family – particles made of quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the baryons – subatomic particles composed of three quarks. The main difference between mesons and baryons is that mesons have integer spin (thus are bosons) while baryons are fermions (half-integer spin). Because mesons are bosons, the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply to them. Because of this, they can act as force mediating particles on short distances, and thus play a part in processes such as the nuclear interaction.\n\nSince mesons are composed of quarks, they participate in both the weak and strong interactions. Mesons with net electric charge also participate in the electromagnetic interaction. They are classified according to their quark content, total angular momentum, parity, and various other properties such as C-parity and G-parity. While no meson is stable, those of lower mass are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons, and are easier to observe and study in particle accelerators or in cosmic ray experiments. They are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and will exhibit higher-energy phenomena sooner than baryons would. For example, the charm quark was first seen in the J/Psi meson () in 1974, and the bottom quark in the upsilon meson () in 1977.\n\nEach meson has a corresponding antiparticle (antimeson) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa. For example, a positive pion () is made of one up quark and one down antiquark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the negative pion (), is made of one up antiquark and one down quark. Some experiments show the evidence of \"tetraquarks\" – \"exotic\" mesons made of two quarks and two antiquarks, but the particle physics community as a whole does not view their existence as likely, although still possible.\n\nThe symbols encountered in these lists are: I (\"isospin\"), J (\"total angular momentum\"), P (\"parity\"), C (\"C-parity\"), G (\"G-parity\"), u (\"up quark\"), d (\"down quark\"), s (\"strange quark\"), c (\"charm quark\"), b (\"bottom quark\"), Q (\"charge\"), B (\"baryon number\"), S (\"strangeness\"), C (\"charm\"), and B′ (\"bottomness\"), as well as a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name).\n\nBecause this table was initially derived from published results and many of those results were preliminary, as many as 64 of the mesons in the following table may not exist or have the wrong mass or quantum numbers.\n\nThe following lists details for all known and predicted pseudoscalar (J = 0) and vector (J = 1) mesons.\n\nThe properties and quark content of the particles are tabulated below; for the corresponding antiparticles, simply change quarks into antiquarks (and vice versa) and flip the sign of Q, B, S, C, and B′.

They are a staple food at fairs and barbecues in the Central New York region, where they are most popular. Potatoes specifically intended for salt potatoes can be purchased by the bag along with packages of salt.\n\nAs the potatoes cook, the salty water forms a crust on the skin and seals the potatoes so they never taste waterlogged, as ordinary boiled potatoes often do. The potatoes have a unique texture closer to fluffy baked potatoes, only creamier. The standard recipe calls for one pound of salt for every four pounds of potatoes.\n\nThe Syracuse area of New York has a long history of salt production. Salt springs located around Onondaga Lake were used to create consumable salt that was distributed throughout the northeast via the Erie Canal. Salinated brine was laid out to dry on large trays. The salt residue was then scraped up, ground, and packaged.\n\nSalt potatoes originated in Syracuse and once comprised the bulk of a salt worker's daily diet. During the 1800s, Irish salt miners would bring a bag of small, unpeeled, substandard potatoes to work each day. Come lunch time, they boiled the potatoes in the \"free-flowing\" salt brine.\n\nBy the early 1900s, the potatoes were a Central New York favorite and a local entrepreneur, John Hinerwadel, started serving them as a side \"at his famous clambakes.\" He later began packaging five-pound bags of potatoes along with a 12-ounce box of salt and labeled them \"Hinerwadel's Famous Original Salt Potatoes\". The first packaged salt potatoes were sold in the 1960s. Today, Hinerwadel sells a million bags of \"salt potatoes\" annually.\n\n\"Salt potatoes\" are bite-size \"young\" white potatoes scrubbed and boiled in their skins. The use of red-skinned new potatoes is not considered authentic. The proper size potatoes are \"Size B, Grade US No. 2\". The potatoes are small and their appearance and shape are not important.\n\nAccording to a recipe, the cooking water contains salt in a ratio of one cup of salt to six cups of water, giving the dish its name, unique flavor, and texture. After cooking, salt potatoes are served with melted butter.\n\nThe resulting potatoes are creamy, as the starch in the potatoes cooks more completely due to the higher boiling temperature of the extra-salty water. The salty skin stands up particularly well to both herbed and plain melted butter.\n\nIn Germany there is a dish with the same name, \"Salzkartoffeln\". However, far less salt is used compared to Syracuse Salt Potatoes; also, the potatoes often are peeled prior to cooking. So, despite the direct literal translation, \"Boiled Potatoes\" would be a more practical interpretation. \"Salzkartoffeln\" is a popular side dish in many German meals. The name \"Salzkartoffeln\" is used to distinguish peeled potatoes boiled in slightly salted water from unpeeled ones, usually boiled without any salt. The latter is called \"Pellkartoffeln\" and is eaten with butter or quark cheese.\n\n\n"}

It is made using the \"Platostoma palustre\" plant (a member of the mint family) and has a mild, slightly bitter taste. It is served chilled, with other toppings such as fruit, or in bubble tea or other drinks. Outside Asia, it is sold in Asian supermarkets.\n\nGrass jelly is made by boiling the aged and slightly oxidized stalks and leaves of \"Platostoma palustre\" (\"Mesona chinensis\") with potassium carbonate for several hours with a little starch and then cooling the liquid to a jelly-like consistency. This jelly can be cut into cubes or other forms, and then mixed with syrup to produce a drink or dessert thought to have cooling (\"yin\") properties, which makes it typically consumed during hot weather. The jelly itself is fragrant, with a smoky undertone, and is a translucent dark brown, sometimes perceived to be black. Food coloring may sometimes be added to make it darker.\n\nSome other variants of grass jelly, known as green grass jelly, don't require cooking or heating process to make, only requiring a mixture of leaf extracts and water. Jelly produced in this way has been described as having a leafy neutral or plain flavor.\n\nIn Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, grass jelly was traditionally served with sugar syrup. Now it is often served mixed with other ingredients, such as mango, sago, watermelon, cantaloupe, and other fresh or canned fruit, and condensed or evaporated milk.\n\nAlthough this dish is sometimes called \"liangfen\" (\"leung fan\") in Chinese, it should not be confused with the Chinese starch jelly \"liangfen\", which is an entirely different dish.\n\nGrass jelly is known as \"cincau\" in Indonesian (it means green grass in Chinese). It is also known as camcao, juju, janggelan or kepleng in Java, camcauh in Sunda, and daluman in Bali. Black jelly (\"cincau hitam\") is manufactured as an instant powder, like other instant jellies or agar. This form is easier to use. It is made from the leaves of \"Platostoma palustre\" (\"Mesona palustris\").\n\nThere are other plants that were used in Indonesia to make grass jelly. They are \"Melastoma polyanthum\", known as \"cincau perdu\", and \"Cyclea barbata\", known as \"cincau hijau\" or green grass jelly, and Cocculus orbiculatus or known as \"cincau Cina\" or Chinese green grass jelly. Some plants from genus Stephania such as \"Stephania hernandifolia\" (also known as \"Stephania japonica\") and \"Stephania capitata\" are also being used as a substitute to create green grass jelly called \"cincau minyak\" or oily grass jelly.\n\nUsually, the process of making Indonesian green grass jelly doesn't require a cooking or heating process. Mixing leaf extract and water with the addition of a period of waiting time for coagulation at mild room temperature is enough.\n\nIndonesian green grass jelly has a distinct flavor compared to black grass jelly. It is absent of smoky flavor, almost no bitter taste, and has mild leafy flavor. Due to its plain neutral flavor, it is usually consumed with sugar water, syrup, coconut milk, and ice.\n\nPlain grass jelly is mixed in various kinds of desserts, such as \"ais kacang\" and \"cendol\". It is also mixed with cold soy milk and served as a refreshing drink/dessert, a drink known as Michael Jackson in South-East Asia (a reference to Michael Jackson's changing skin color and/or the song \"Black or White\").\nVarious combinations of grass jelly with rose flavoured syrup added to milk (bandung) are called \"bandung cincau\" or \"bancau\" for short. There is also shaved ice with grass jelly toppings. It can be green or brown.\n\nGrass jelly (Philippine: \"gulaman\") bricks are used in the various Philippine refreshments or desserts such as \"sago’t gulaman\", \"buko-pandan\", agar flan or \"halo-halo\". It may also be used in fruit salads.\n\nIn Taiwan, grass jelly is known as 仙草 (xian cao), and is used in various desserts and drinks. It can sometimes be added to boba drinks and shaved ice (刨冰). It is also commonly used in a traditional Taiwanese drink, where the jelly is heated and melted to be consumed as a thick dessert beverage (仙草茶), with numerous toppings like tangyuan, taro balls, azuki beans, and tapioca.\n\nIn Thailand, grass jelly is known as \"chaokuai\" (, ) like the Teochew (from Hokkien ). It is commonly served relatively plain together with ice and natural brown sugar. Additionally, it can also be served with fruits such as jackfruit, the fruit of the toddy palm or mixed with other Thai desserts.\n\nIn Vietnamese, grass jelly is \"sương sáo\" or \"thạch sương sáo\". Grass jelly is chopped in small cubes and served as an additional ingredient in sweet desserts made from various kinds of beans (\"chè\"). There are two common kinds of grass jelly in Vietnam which are \"Platostoma palustre\" (\"Mesona chinensis\", called \"sương sáo\" in Vietnamese) and \"Tiliacora triandra\" (called \"sương sâm\"; \"sương sa\" or \"rau câu\" is the name for jelly made from various kinds of algae). It is common now to eat green grass jelly (thạch lá găng) with douhua (tào phớ) and grass jelly (sương sáo or thạch đen) in the summer.\n\n\n"}

Close equivalents could include bogan, white trash, tacky, scanger and ghetto. \"Redneck\" can also be close although the word in Spanish \"palurdo\" is more similar since it is used for rural people. Naco is also used to pejoratively describe someone who has indigenous roots. The correct meaning comes from an Indigenous language. This is pointing fingers at someone with lack of knowledge of his own culture.\n\nA \"naco\" () is usually associated with lower socio-economic classes and/or the indigenous, but it also includes the nouveau-riche.\n\nThe term \"naco\" is generally used to describe people, behaviors or aesthetic choices seen as unrefined or unsophisticated, often in a comic way. As a person, the \"naco\" may display a general lack of refinement by adopting a \"gangster mentality\", unrefined verbal expressions or slang, peculiar accents, lack of social manners, or comically bad taste. The word likely originated as a contraction of \"\"totonaco\"\" referring to the members of the Totonac people, which is sometimes used as a disparaging term for indigenous people in general.\n\nThe term is often associated to lower social classes, but it is also used as an elitist expression from the educated to describe the uneducated, and among the middle and upper classes as a synonym of bad taste.

However, the usage and derogatory tones vary.\nFor example: \"Damn, that guy is such a naco\"\n\nIn recent decades, the middle and upper classes in Mexico have experienced a rapid expansion due to, among other things, economic development and urbanization. The new middle class and \"nouveau riche\" have entered the competition on status symbols such as cars, houses, and jewelry, which have given rise to the term \"naco\" as a form of cultural or economic elitism. Mexicans of higher status often see extravagant displays of wealth as making a person \"more\" naco, in that they make spectacles of themselves by overcompensating for lower social status. The word naco is unfortunately still used as a pejorative adjective or noun for indigenous people.\n\n"}

It is a tubed pasta made of hard durum wheat flour and water. Its length is 25–30 cm (10–12 in) with a 3 mm (1/8 inch) diameter. The average cooking time is nine minutes. In Italian cuisine, it is served with buttery sauces, pancetta or guanciale, vegetables, cheese, eggs, and anchovies or sardines.\n\nOne of the most common sauces to serve with bucatini is the classic Amatriciana sauce. It is traditionally made with guanciale, a type of cured meat taken from the pork jowl. \n\nSimilarly, ziti are long hollow rods which are also smooth in texture and have square-cut edges; \"cut ziti\" are ziti cut into shorter tubes. There is also zitoni , which is a wider version of ziti.\n\nStandard pasta machines will roll out sheets of flat pasta which are then cut into ribbons to make flat, ribbon-style pasta like fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle. Bucatini, on the other hand, has to be extruded rather than rolled.\n\nThe pasta dough is fed into a machine that forces it through a perforated disk, very similar to a meat grinder. The shape of the pasta depends on the shape of the perforations. Bucatini is made with a disk with tiny circular perforations, which forces the pasta dough to emerge in long tubes. The tubes are then trimmed off to the desired length and then either dried or cooked fresh.\n\nBucatini can be made at home with a stand mixer and a pasta extruder. Since bucatini has a hole in the middle, it must be handled gently so as not to squeeze the hole shut prior to eating. \n\n"}

The ribcage of a domestic pig, meat and bones together, is cut into usable pieces, prepared by smoking, grilling, or baking – usually with a sauce, often barbecue – and then served.\n\nSeveral different types of ribs are available, depending on the section of rib cage from which they are cut. Variation in the thickness of the meat and bone, as well as levels of fat in each cut, can alter the flavor and texture of the prepared dish. The inner surface of the rib cage is covered by a layer of connective tissue (pleura) that is difficult to cook tender; it is usually removed before marinating or cooking.\n\nBaby back ribs (also back ribs or loin ribs) are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about and the longest is usually about , depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10–13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them \"cheater racks\".\n\n\nRib tips are short, meaty sections of rib attached to the lower end of the spare ribs, between the ribs and the sternum. Unlike back ribs or spare ribs, the structure of the rib is provided by dense costal cartilage, not bone. Rib tips are cut away from the spare ribs when preparing St. Louis style spare ribs.\n\nRiblets are prepared by butchers by cutting a full set of spare ribs approximately in half. This produces a set of short, flat ribs where the curved part of the rib is removed and gives them a more uniform look. Loin back ribs don't always have this removed. When not removed they have a rounded look to them and are often referred to as baby back ribs. Another product (imprecisely) called riblets is actually the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Riblets used to be thrown out by butchers, but have become popular due to their excellent flavor and lower cost.\n\nButton ribs (or \"feather bones\") are often confused with riblets mostly because Applebee's sells these as \"riblets\". In fact, what Applebee's sells is found just past the ribs near the back bone, just underneath the tenderloin. This cut of meat actually has no bones, but instead has \"buttons\" of cartilaginous material with meat attached. \n\nRib tips (or brisket) are found at the bottom of the spare ribs by the sternum. The rib tips have a high proportion of cartilage. The rib tips give the spare ribs a rounded appearance. In an attempt to give the meat a more uniform appearance and make it easier to eat, this piece is sometimes removed, and the remaining spare ribs are referred to as \"Saint Louis style ribs\".\n\n\n"}

The pomander was worn or carried in a vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against infection in times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad smells. The globular cases which contained the pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or belt, or attached to the girdle, and were usually perforated in a variety of openwork techniques, and made of gold or silver. Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a different perfume.\n\nThe term \"pomander\" can refer to the scented material itself or to the container that which contains such material. The container could be made of gold or silver and eventually evolved to be shaped like nuts, skulls, hearts, books and ships. Smaller versions were made to be attached by a chain to a finger ring and held in the hand. Even smaller versions served as cape buttons or rosary beads.\n\nA pomander can be a bag containing fragrant herbs and might be viewed as an early form of aromatherapy. Pomanders can be considered related to censers, in which aromatics are burned or roasted rather than naturally evaporated.\n\nPomanders were first mentioned in literature in the mid-thirteenth century. They were used in the late Middle Ages through the 17th century.\nAlso a version of the pomander with oranges, cloves, oils, and a golden ribbon can be used as a recovery charm in witchcraft.\n\nPomanders were first made for carrying as religious keepsakes.\n\nThe \"Archaeological Journal\", Volume 31 of 1874 describes on page 339 a 1584 formula for making a pomander that was also published by Frederic Madden in his 1831 history book \"Privy purse expenses of the Princess Mary, daughter of King Henry the Eighth, afterwards Queen Mary\" on page 257:\n\nMichel de Nostredame had a similar method and formula using similar ingredients, but a rather different procedure.\n\n\"Rose tablets\" were made by soaking a pound of roses without the flower heads in deer musk water overnight. The water was then thoroughly squeezed out and the roses ground with seven ounces of benzoin, a quarter of ambergris and another of civet musk. This mixture was made into tablets, which were each sandwiched between rose petals and dried in a cool, dark area\n\nTo form the final pomander, two ounces of the purest labdanum, an ounce each of Styrax calamites and benzoin resin, half an ounce of the rose tablets, one ounce of violet powder, and half a dram each ambergris and musk were ground into a powder and kneaded with the rose-musk water from the production of the rose tablets. This produced \"an aromatic ball of the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world.\"\n\nIn the late 16th century the pouncet box appeared which, whilst retaining the traditional features of the pomander, was designed to hold liquid perfumes, blended with powder and absorbed on a sponge or piece of cotton. It was favoured by the upper classes who appreciated the delicacy of the liquid perfumes. Its name stemmed from the fact that the box was \"pounced\" or pierced to release the scent.\n\nOne modern style of pomander is made by studding an orange or other fruit with whole dried cloves and letting it cure dry, after which it may last many, many years. This modern pomander serves the functions of perfuming and freshening the air and also of keeping drawers of clothing and linens fresh, pleasant-smelling, and moth-free.\n\nOther ingredients in the process of making pomanders are:\n\n\nA pomander is worn by Rosemary Woodhouse, in Roman Polanski's 1968 film, \"Rosemary's Baby\". It figures as a central part of the plot development.\n\nThe pouncet box is mentioned in Shakespeare's \"Henry IV Part I\" when Hotspur is accused of withholding Scottish nobles captured in a skirmish and in self-defence pleads, in describing the King's messenger:\n\nMedieval pomander paste formulas usually contained ambergris. From this came \"pomme ambre\" (amber apple) and from there the word \"pomander\" was developed. Other names for the pomander are Ambraapfel, Bisamapfel, Bisamknopf, Bisambüchse, balsam apple, Desmerknopf, musk ball Desmerapfel, Oldanokapsel, Pisambüchse, and smelling apple.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2396851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2396851", "title": "Airline meal", "text": "Airline meal\n\nAn airline meal, airline food, or in-flight meal is a meal served to passengers on board a commercial airliner. These meals are prepared by specialist airline catering services and normally served to passengers using an airline service trolley.\n\nThese meals vary widely in quality and quantity across different airline companies and classes of travel. They range from a simple snack or beverage in short-haul economy class to a seven-course gourmet meal in a first class long-haul flight. The types of food offered also vary widely from country to country, and often incorporate elements of local cuisine, sometimes both from the origin and destination countries. When ticket prices were regulated in the American domestic market, food was the primary means airlines differentiated themselves.\n\nThe first airline meals were served by Handley Page Transport, an airline company founded in 1919, to serve the London–Paris route in October of that year. Passengers could choose from a selection of sandwiches and fruit.\n\nThe type of food varies depending upon the airline company and class of travel. Meals may be served on one tray or in multiple courses with no tray and with a tablecloth, metal cutlery, and glassware (generally in first and business classes). Often the food is reflective of the culture of the country the airline is based in.\n\nThe airline dinner typically includes meat (most commonly chicken or beef), fish, or pasta; a salad or vegetable; a small bread roll; and a dessert. Condiments (typically salt, pepper, and sugar) are supplied in small sachets or shakers.\n\nCaterers usually produce alternative meals for passengers with restrictive diets. These must usually be ordered at least 24 hours in advance, sometimes when buying the ticket. Some of the more common examples include:\n\nFor several Islamic airlines (e.g. EgyptAir, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Batik Air, Malindo Air, Flydubai, Gulf Air, Iran Air, Mahan Air, Iran Aseman Airlines, Oman Air, Yemenia, Royal Jordanian, Kuwait Airways, Iraqi Airways, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Libyan Airlines, Afriqiyah Airways, Tunisair, Jazeera Airways, Air Algérie, Air Arabia, and Turkish Airlines), in accordance with Islamic customs, all classes and dishes on the plane are served a Muslim meal with Halal certification – without pork and alcohol. While Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar still provide bottles of wine to non-Muslim passengers, the cabin crew does not deliver alcoholic beverages lest to violate Islamic customs, unless those non-Muslim passengers request it. Turkish Airlines does not serve any meals with pork or lard, but especially during international flights, a variety of alcoholic beverages are served upon request. Because Iran and Saudi Arabia apply strict Sharia regulations, those countries' airlines do not deliver pork or alcoholic beverages, and all airlines flying to or from Iran or Saudi Arabia are prohibited from serving either. However, Garuda Indonesia still serves alcoholic beverages (whiskey, beer, champagne, and wine) to non-Muslim passengers.\n\nIn the case of Israeli airlines El Al, Arkia, and Israir, all meals served are kosher-certified by Rabbis. Even at destinations outside Israel, sky chefs must be supervised by rabbis to make kosher meals and load their planes. Many other airlines also supply kosher-certified meals, which they buy in from outside certified providers and are supplied to the passengers sealed. These may contain food in double-wrapped foil containers which can be heated up in the plane oven, alongside non-kosher food, without breaking the appropriate dietary laws.\n\nBefore the September 11 attacks in 2001, first class passengers were often provided with full sets of metal cutlery. Afterward, common household items were evaluated more closely for their potential use as weapons on aircraft, and both first class and coach class passengers were restricted to plastic utensils. Some airlines switched from metal to all-plastic or plastic-handled cutlery during the SARS outbreak in 2003, since the SARS virus transfers from person to person easily, and plastic cutlery can be thrown away after use. Many airlines later switched back to metal cutlery. However, Singapore Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines continue to use metal utensils even in economy class as of 2019.\n\nSome airlines also made the switch to plastic cutlery in economy class to recover costs resulting from passenger theft, of which metal cutlery tends to be a common item targeted.\n\nIn May 2010, concerns were raised in Australia and New Zealand over their respective flag carriers, Qantas and Air New Zealand, reusing their plastic cutlery for international flights between 10 and 30 times before replacement. Both airlines cited cost saving, international quarantine, and environmental as the reasons for the choice. Both have also said that the plastic cutlery is commercially washed and sterilized before reuse. Reusing plastic tablewares though is a regular practice among many airliners and food caterers.\nFor cleanliness, most meals come with a napkin and a moist towelette. First and business class passengers are often provided with hot towels.\n\nDuring morning flights a cooked breakfast or smaller continental-style may be served. On long haul flights (and short/medium haul flights within Asia) breakfast normally includes an entrée of pancakes or eggs, traditional fried breakfast foods such as sausages and grilled tomatoes, and often muffins or pastries, fruits, and breakfast cereal on the side. On shorter flights a continental-style breakfast, generally including a miniature box of breakfast cereal, fruits and either a muffin, pastry, or bagel. Coffee and tea are offered as well, and sometimes hot chocolate.\n\nFood on board a flight is usually free on full-service Asian airlines and on almost all long-distance flights, while they might cost extra on low-cost airlines or European full-service airline flights. Quality may also fluctuate due to shifts in the economics of the airline industry.\n\nOn long-haul international flights in first class and business class, most Asian and European airlines serve gourmet meals, while legacy carriers based in the US tend to serve multicourse meals including a cocktail snack, appetizer, soup, salad, entrée (chicken, beef, fish, or pasta), cheeses with fruit, and ice cream. Some long-haul flights in first and business class offer such delicacies as caviar, champagne, and sorbet (intermezzo).\n\nThe cost and availability of meals on US airlines has changed considerably in recent years, as financial pressures have forced some airlines to either begin charging for meals, or abandon them altogether in favor of small snacks, as in the case of Southwest Airlines. Eliminating free pretzels saved Northwest $2 million annually. Nowadays, the main US legacy carriers (American, Delta, and United) have discontinued full meal service in economy class on short-haul US domestic and North American flights, while retaining it on most intercontinental routes; and at least one European carrier, Icelandair, follows this policy on intercontinental runs as well.\n\nAs of 2018, all 4 major U.S. legacy airlines now offer free snacks on board in economy class. United Airlines re-introduced free snacks in February 2016. From April 2016, American Airlines fully restored free snacks on all domestic flights in economy class. Free meals will also be available on certain domestic routes. Delta and Southwest have already been offering free snacks for years.\n\nHawaiian Airlines is the only remaining major US airline that offers complimentary in–flight meals on its domestic flights.\n\nAir China has reported that each domestic flight's meal requires RMB50 (US$7.30) while international flights require RMB70 (US$10). However, this figure varies from airline to airline, as some have reported costs to be as low as US$3.50. Air China is also minimizing costs by loading only 95% of all meals to reduce leftovers and storing non-perishable foods for emergencies.\n\nIn 1958 Pan Am and several European airlines entered into a legal dispute over whether certain airline food sandwiches counted as a \"meal\".\n\nMeals must generally be prepared on the ground before takeoff. Guillaume de Syon, a history professor at Albright College who wrote about the history of airline meals, said that the higher altitudes alter the taste of the food and the function of the taste buds; according to de Syon the food may taste \"dry and flavorless\" as a result of the pressurization and passengers, feeling thirsty due to pressurization, may drink alcohol when they ought to drink water. Tests have shown that the perception of saltiness and sweetness drops 30% at high altitudes. The low humidity in airline cabins also dries out the nose which decreases olfactory sensors which are essential for tasting flavor in dishes.\n\nFood safety is paramount in the airline catering industry. A case of mass food poisoning amongst the passengers on an airliner could have disastrous consequences. For example, on February 20, 1992, shrimp tainted with cholera was served on Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 386. An elderly passenger died and other passengers fell ill. For this reason catering firms and airlines have worked together to provide a set of industry guidelines specific to the needs of airline catering. The World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering is offered free of charge by the International Flight Service Association.\n\n"}

It can also include other ingredients. These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners.The history of chocolate cake goes back to 1764, when Dr. James Baker discovered how to make chocolate by grinding cocoa beans between two massive circular millstones.\nIn 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was \"rock cacao\" or ground into powder. The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack. A process for making silkier and smoother chocolate called conching was developed in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt and made it easier to bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters. Until 1890 to 1900, chocolate recipes were mostly for chocolate drinks, and its presence in cakes was only in fillings and glazes. In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate to the cake batter, to make the first chocolate cakes in the US.\n\nThe Duff Company of Pittsburgh, a molasses manufacturer, introduced Devil's food chocolate cake mixes in the mid-1930s, but introduction was put on hold during World War II. Duncan Hines introduced a \"Three Star Special\" (so called because a white, yellow or chocolate cake could be made from the same mix) was introduced three years after cake mixes from General Mills and Duncan Hines, and took over 48 percent of the market.\n\nIn the U.S., \"chocolate decadence\" cakes were popular in the 1980s; in the 1990s, single-serving molten chocolate cakes with liquid chocolate centers and infused chocolates with exotic flavors such as tea, curry, red pepper, passion fruit, and champagne were popular. Chocolate lounges and artisanal chocolate makers were popular in the 2000s. Rich, flourless, all-but-flourless chocolate cakes are \"now standard in the modern pâtisserie,\" according to \"The New Taste of Chocolate\" in 2001.\n\nPopular variants on chocolate cake include:\n\n"}

A \"tarte flambée\" would be used to test the heat of their wood-fired ovens.

The crust that forms the border of the tarte flambée would be nearly burned by the flames. The result resembles a thin pizza.\n\n"}
{"id": "2400606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2400606", "title": "Minibar", "text": "Minibar\n\nA minibar is a small refrigerator, typically an absorption refrigerator, in a luxury hotel room or cruise ship stateroom. The hotel staff fill it with drinks and snacks for the guest to purchase during their stay. It is stocked with a precise inventory of goods, with a price list. The guest is charged for goods consumed when checking out of the hotel. Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases. These detect the removal of an item, and charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed. This is done to prevent loss of product, theft and lost revenue.\n\nThe minibar is commonly stocked with small bottles of alcoholic beverages, juice, bottled water, and soft drinks. There may also be candy, cookies, crackers, and other small snacks. Prices are generally very high compared to similar items purchased from a store, because the guest is paying for the convenience of immediate access and also the upkeep of the bar. Prices vary, but it is not uncommon for one can of non-alcoholic beverage to cost 6–10 USD. Due to the convenience of room service and the minibar, prices charged to the patron are much higher than the hotel's restaurant or tuck shop. As premium bottled water has become popular with guests since the 2000s, there is \"ambient placement\" of such chargeable products outside the minibar and in the guests' line of vision; for example \"by placing [bottled] water on bedside tables, during the night, people are more likely to grab it than get up to get a glass of water\".\n\nThe world's first minibar was introduced at the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel by manager Robert Arnold in 1974. In the months following its introduction in-room drink sales skyrocketed 500%, and the Hong Kong Hilton's overall annual revenue was boosted by 5%. The following year the Hilton group rolled out the minibar concept across all its hotels.\n\nIn recent years, as minibars become less and less popular with guests, hotels have been eliminating this feature from their rooms. It takes staff considerable time to re-stock the traditional mini-bar inventory and monitor its use precisely, and such manual work is prone to human error. In recent years cunning guests have managed to game the traditional minibar system, such as replacing or emptying the contents of items (also known as \"shrinkage\" as this fools both hotel staff and the next set of hotel guests), consuming items before immediately lodging a complaint to switch hotel rooms, and disputing the minibar charges at check-out time. Some newer minibars use infrared or other automated methods of recording purchases, detecting the removal of an item and automatically charge the guest's credit card right away, even if the item is not consumed.\n\nTypically the minibar cooling unit was different from standard refrigerators, using absorption technology. An Italian company was the first manufacturer to install a compressor mini-refrigerator in the NASA Space Shuttle in 1982. A compressor refrigeration unit, in addition to a timer\nand a eutectic plate, allow saving more energy, compared to a traditional absorption minibar.\n"}

Kare-kare can also be made with seafood (prawns, squid, and mussels) or vegetables (sometimes exclusively vegetables, becoming \"Kare-kareng gulay\"). Vegetables, which include eggplant, Chinese cabbage, or other greens, daikon, green beans, okra, and asparagus beans are added—usually equaling or exceeding the amount of meat. The stew is flavored with ground roasted peanuts or peanut butter, onions, and garlic. It is colored with annatto and can be thickened with toasted or plain ground rice.\n\nOther flavorings may be added, but the dish is usually quite plain in tastiness, compared to other Filipino dishes.

Another is from Sepoy conscripts from Southern India that settled in Philippines during the British occupation of Manila. Homesick, they improvised their own cuisine with available materials. They called it kari-kaari, curry, and now, kare-kare. Its name derived from the word \"kari\" from the word \"curry\". However, kare-kare is far different from Indian curry. Kare-kare has a similar flavor to satay because of the peanuts in the sauce.\n\nOxtail, with the skin on and cut into 2-inch lengths, and ox tripe are boiled until tender. Sometimes pieces of ox feet or shins are added. When the meat is tender, the soup becomes gelatinous. Ground roasted peanuts (or peanut butter), ground roasted glutinous rice is added to make the soup thicker. Annatto is added to give color.

Maize (corn) is commonly used as the source of the starch in the US, in which case the syrup is called \"corn syrup\", but glucose syrup is also made from potatoes and wheat, and less often from barley, rice and cassava.\n\nGlucose syrup containing over 90% glucose is used in industrial fermentation, but syrups used in confectionery contain varying amounts of glucose, maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade, and can typically contain 10% to 43% glucose. Glucose syrup is used in foods to sweeten, soften texture and add volume. By converting some of the glucose in corn syrup into fructose (using an enzymatic process), a sweeter product, high fructose corn syrup can be produced.\n\nIt was first made in 1811 in Russia.\n\nDepending on the method used to hydrolyse the starch and on the extent to which the hydrolysis reaction has been allowed to proceed, different grades of glucose syrup are produced, which have different characteristics and uses. The syrups are broadly categorised according to their dextrose equivalent (DE). The further the hydrolysis process proceeds, the more reducing sugars are produced, and the higher the DE. Depending on the process used, glucose syrups with different compositions, and hence different technical properties, can have the same DE.\n\nThe original glucose syrups were manufactured by acid hydrolysis of corn starch at high temperature and pressure. The typical product had a DE of 42, but quality was variable due to the difficulty of controlling the reaction. Higher DE syrups made by acid hydrolysis tend to have a bitter taste and a dark colour, due to the production of hydroxymethylfurfural and other byproducts. This type of product is now manufactured using a continuous process and is still widely used due to the low cost of acid hydrolysis. The sugar profile of a confectioner's syrup can also be mimicked by enzyme hydrolysis. A typical confectioner's syrup contains 19% glucose, 14% maltose, 11% maltotriose and 56% higher molecular mass carbohydrates. A typical 42 DE syrup has about half the sweetness of sugar, and increasing DE leads to increased sweetness, with a 63 DE syrup being about 70%, and pure dextrose (100 DE) about 80% as sweet as sugar.\n\nBy using β-amylase or fungal α-amylase, glucose syrups containing over 50% maltose, or even over 70% maltose (extra-high-maltose syrup) can be produced. This is possible because these enzymes remove two glucose units (i.e. one maltose molecule) at a time from the end of the starch molecule. High-maltose glucose syrup has a great advantage in the production of hard candy: at a given moisture level and temperature, a maltose solution has a lower viscosity than a glucose solution, but will still set to a hard product. Maltose is also less humectant than glucose, so candy produced with high-maltose syrup will not become sticky as easily as candy produced with a standard glucose syrup.\n\nIrrespective of the feedstock or the method used for hydrolysis, certain steps are common to the production of glucose syrup:\n\nBefore conversion of starch to glucose can begin, the starch must be separated from the plant material. This includes removing fibre and protein (which can be valuable by-products, for example wheat or maize gluten). Protein produces off-flavours and colours due to the Maillard reaction, and fibre is insoluble and has to be removed to allow the starch to become hydrated. The plant material also needs to be ground as part of this process to expose the starch to the water.\n\nThe starch needs to be swelled to allow the enzymes or acid to act upon it. When grain is used, sulfur dioxide is added to prevent spoilage.\n\nBy heating the ground, cleaned feedstock, starch gelatinization takes place: the intermolecular bonds of the starch molecules are broken down, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule, so the chains begin to separate into an amorphous form. This prepares the starch for hydrolysis.\n\nGlucose syrup can be produced by acid hydrolysis, enzyme hydrolysis, or a combination of the two. Currently, however, a variety of options are available.\n\nFormerly, glucose syrup was only produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then heating the mixture under pressure. Currently, glucose syrup is mainly produced by first adding the enzyme α-amylase to a mixture of corn starch and water. α-amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium \"Bacillus\"; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria are grown. The enzyme breaks the starch into oligosaccharides, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme glucoamylase, known also as \"γ-amylase\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the fungus \"Aspergillus\"; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.\n\nAfter hydrolysis, the dilute syrup can be passed through columns to remove impurities, improving its colour and stability.\n\nThe dilute glucose syrup is finally evaporated under vacuum to raise the solids concentration.\n\nIts major uses in commercially prepared food products are as a thickener, sweetener, and humectant (an ingredient that retains moisture and thus maintains a food's freshness). Glucose syrup is also widely used in the manufacture of a variety of candy products.\n\nIn the United States, domestically produced corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are often used in American-made processed and mass-produced foods, candies, soft drinks and fruit drinks to increase profit margins.\n\nGlucose syrup was the primary corn sweetener in the United States prior to the expanded use of HFCS production. HFCS is a variant in which other enzymes are used to convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is sweeter and more soluble. Corn syrup is also available as a retail product.\n\nGlucose syrup is often used as part of the mixture that goes into creating fake blood for films and television. Blood mixtures that contain glucose syrup are very popular among independent films and film makers, as it is cheap and easy to obtain.\n\n\n"}

These charms may be coins or small symbolic objects (e.g., a small piece of a dogwood branch with a bud, symbolizing health or longevity). More recently, people have started writing happy wishes on small pieces of paper and wrapping them in tin foil. Wishes may include happiness, health, or success throughout the new year (similar to fortune cookies).\n\nBanitsa is served for breakfast with plain yogurt, ayran, or boza. It can be eaten hot or cold. Some varieties include banitsa with spinach \"спаначник\" (\"spanachnik\") or the sweet version, banitsa with milk \"млечна баница\" (\"mlechna banitsa\") or pumpkin \"тиквеник\" (\"tikvenik\").\n\nThe Bulgarian word баница derives from the Old Bulgarian гъбнѫти meaning \"to fold.\" The word developed from the Proto-Slavic form *гыбаница > *гъбаница > *гбаница > баница.\n\nTraditionally, banitsa is made with homemade or commercially made pastry sheets that are prepared from a baker's hard dough including flour, eggs, and water. At home the sheets can be spread by continuously pulling the sheet of dough with one's fingers until it becomes less than a millimeter thin, or by using a rolling pin in several stages with sunflower oil sprinkled between the partially spread leaves, or by a very difficult technique comprising waving movements of the entire sheet over the head of the cook, which resembles pizza dough making techniques. Commercially available sheets are mechanically spread and somewhat dried before packing.\n\nAnother sort of banitsa is called \"tutmanik\" (тутманик) or \"poparnik\" (попарник) and is made with leavened sheets. The usual filling is cheese.\n\nThe traditional filling is made of crushed white cheese (sirene, feta cheese), yogurt, and eggs. Sometimes baking soda is added to the yogurt, which makes it rise (as the baking soda reacts with the acid in yogurt). The addition of baking soda results in a fluffier filling.\n\nVegetable fillings include spinach, sorrel, docks, mangold, chards, beet leaves, nettles, leeks, onions, parsley, cabbage or sauerkraut. All these variants, including cabbage, are called \"zelnik\" (зелник), from the word зелен (zelen) 'green'. The leek variant is called \"praznik\" (празник) and onion variant is called \"luchnik\" (лучник).\n\nIn some regions of Bulgaria, a filling with rice is made. There are also meat fillings with minced meat, onions, and mushrooms. Sweet fillings with apples (similar to apple pie or strudel) or pumpkin with sugar, walnuts and cinnamon exist as well. In some regions, only the walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon are used. The apple variant is called \"shtrudel\" (щрудел), and the pumpkin variant is \"tikvenik\" (тиквеник).\n\nBanitsa with milk is made by baking the leaves soaked in milk with sugar, eggs and vanilla.\n\nIn a large greased baking dish, individual sheets are layered one by one with small amounts of filling and sunflower oil or/and melted butter between them. After half of the sheets are placed in the pan, a large portion of the filling is spooned onto the leaves and is then covered with the remaining sheets and filling in the same manner. The pastry is then baked at 200–250 °C. In some recipes, just before the banitsa is finished, a glass of lemonade or sparkling water is poured into the tray, and the baking continues for several more minutes.\n\nAn alternative method of preparation is taking each sheet of dough, laying it out flat and sprinkling some of the filling on it. Then, the sheet is rolled up into a tight roll with the filling on the inside of the roll. The long roll is then taken and rolled up in a circle. This first sheet of dough is then placed in the baking pan. The process is repeated with the remaining sheets of dough and each consecutive roll is placed around the first one in the pan. The resulting shape resembles a spiral (see photo). The banitsa is then sprinkled with sunflower oil or melted butter and baked.\n\nIn Bulgaria, banitsa is a symbol of Bulgarian cuisine and traditions.\n\nTraditionally, Bulgarians prepare and serve banitza on two holidays – Christmas and New Year's Eve. On these days, people add kusmeti (literally lucks, meaning fortunes, lucky charms) into the banitsa. The charms are usually small pieces of dogwood branch, which vary in numbers of buds on them. They symbolize health and longevity. The branches are hidden inside the banitsa, and the banitsa is then baked. When ready, the banitsa is cut to as many pieces as the members of the family are and each piece contains a dogwood branch. Two additional pieces of banitsa are cut - one for the house and another one for Virgin Mary who is the protector of the family. A wish is associated with each branch and the different number of buds on the branch helps to recognize the corresponding wish. The wishes include happiness, health, success, travel, etc. The banitsa is then spun on the table and everyone takes the piece which is in front of them when the spinning stops. Then they find their fortune inside the piece – the fortunes predict what one is to expect from the new year. The most common fortunes are \"health\", \"love\", \"marriage\", \"baby\", \"journey\", \"wealth\", etc.\n\nAlternatively or in addition to the kusmeti, some add a coin or simply little pieces of paper with written fortunes on them (just like the ones in the fortune cookies). In this case, they are wrapped in tin foil to preserve them during baking.\n\nThe word \"banitsa\" is used as a simile for something (mainly documents and paperwork) creased, or badly maintained. For example, a police officer can make a remark to someone about letting his or her passport \"become like a banitsa\" (станал е на баница); a teacher might say this about a pupil's notebook.\nThe same can be said about a very badly crushed car after an accident.\n\n"}

When served with fried rice and fried egg, it is known as \"tapsilog\" (a portmanteau of the Filipino words \"tapa\", \"sinangag\" and \"itlog\" egg). It sometimes comes with atchara (pickled papaya strips) or sliced tomatoes as side dish. Vinegar or ketchup is usually used as a condiment.\n\n\"Tapa\" in Philippine languages originally meant fish or meat preserved by smoking. During the Spanish colonization period of the Philippines, it came to refer to meats also preserved by other means. It is derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian \"*tapa\", which in turn is derived from Proto-Austronesian \"*Capa\". \"Tinapa\" (literally \"prepared by smoking\") is another cognate, though it usually refers to smoked fish.\n\nBefore cooking tapa, the meat is cured or dried and cut in to small portions or thin slices. As a method of preservation, salt and spices are added.

In Tagalog, a restaurant that primarily serves \"tapa\" is called a \"tapahan\", \"tapsihan\" or \"tapsilugan\". According to some sources, \"tapsilog\" and \"tapsihan\" are colloquial slang words. However, these terms are used by those restaurants and many Filipinos of all social strata. \"Tapsilog\" and \"tapsihan\", therefore, may be considered standard words in the Filipino language rather than slang.\n\nIt was originally intended to be quick breakfast fare and the word originally established in 1980's and came from the famous Tapsi ni Vivian restaurant in Marikina City. According to Vivian del Rosario, owner of Tapsi ni Vivian, she was the first to use the term tapsilog.\n\nThe word \"tapsilog\" has spawned many other dishes, all having fried rice (or garlic fried rice) and fried egg in it and suffixed with \"silog\".

The sauce may be tomato-based, depending on where the Michigan is purchased. Michigans can be served with chopped onions. If served with onions, the onions can either be buried under the sauce, under the hot dog itself, or sprinkled on top of the sauce.\n\nMichigans are particularly popular in the North Country of New York State, and have been so for many decades. Their popularity soon spread to New York City where they remain a fast food staple. One of the earliest known advertisements for Michigans appeared in the Friday, May 27, 1927, \"Plattsburgh Daily Republican\".\n\nMichigans are also very popular in Montreal and other parts of Quebec, where the sauce is often tomato-based. Lafleur Restaurants, a Quebec fast food chain, is known for its Michigans and poutine.\n\nOddly enough, \"Michigan hot dogs\" are never referred to by that name in Michigan itself, nor anywhere else in the Midwest. A similar food item, the Coney Island hot dog or \"Coney dog\", is natural-casing beef or beef and pork European-style \"Frankfurter Würstel\" (Vienna sausage) of German origin having a natural lamb or sheep casing, and topped with a beef heart-based Coney sauce. Conversely, the \"Coney Island\" is not referred to as such on Coney Island, or anywhere else in New York State, instead called either a \"Michigan\" or a \"Red Hot.\"\n\nThere is no consensus on the origin of the Michigan. Although there are many different varieties of Michigan sauce available today, the original Michigan sauce was possibly created by George Todoroff in Jackson, Michigan. The sauce was originally created to be used as a topping on Coney Island hot dogs. In 1914, Mr. Todoroff founded the Jackson Coney Island restaurant and created his Coney Island chili sauce recipe. He retired in 1945.\n\nHow and when Michigan sauce arrived in upstate New York is somewhat of a mystery. The earliest known advertisement for Michigans appeared in the Friday, May 27, 1927, \"Plattsburgh Daily Republican\". The ad announced the opening of \"the Michigan Hot-Dog Stand Tuesday May 24, located between the two dance halls\". That hot dog stand may be the same one mentioned in the Plattsburgh Sentinel on Sept. 16, 1927, as being owned by a Mr. Garth C. Otis:\n\n\"Garth C. Otis has leased the quarters in the Plattsburgh Theatre building formerly occupied as the Locomobile salesroom in which place he will conduct an eating place under the name of the Michigan Hot Dog and Sandwich Shop opening Saturday. Mexican chili con carne will be one of the specialties. Mr. Otis promises a first class place for those who desire short order lunches.\"\n\nThe origin of the \"Michigan\" name may have come from Plattsburgh residents Jack Rabin and his wife, who fell in love with the Jackson Coney Island hot dog while vacationing in Coney Island and subsequently recreated the sauce at Nitzi's, their Michigan hot dog stand on Route 9 just outside Plattsburgh. However, a 1984 Sentinel article indicates that Nitzi's was established in 1935, and says Jack Rabin indicated \"his sauce came from Mrs. Eula Otis, who first coined the name 'Michigans' for her hot dog and sauce.\" Otis was originally from Nashville and met her husband in Detroit, Michigan, where she learned to make meat sauce. They moved to Plattsburgh in the 1920s.\n\nThe Nitzi/Otis recipe is currently in use at Michigans Plus, located in the former IHOP building on Route 3.\n\nIn Vermont, the Michigan dog is almost always split and cooked on a grill before the meat sauce onions and mustard are added. Often, the bun (or a slice of bread) is also grilled. The first ones sold around the Burlington area were called Charlie's Red Hots and the small shop was started during World War II by a well-known and respected restaurateur. The family closely guarded the sauce recipe. The originals are no longer sold, but there are many Michigan copies around and many local families claim to have the \"Charlie's\" sauce recipe.\n\n"}

{"id": "2424332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2424332", "title": "Minhag", "text": "Minhag\n\nMinhag ( \"custom\", pl. , \"minhagim\") is an accepted tradition or group of traditions in Judaism. A related concept, \"Nusach\" (), refers to the traditional order and form of the prayers.\n\nThe Hebrew root N-H-G () means primarily \"to drive\" or, by extension, \"to conduct (oneself)\".\n\nThe actual word \"minhag\" appears twice in the Hebrew Bible, both times in the same verse and rendered in this translation as \"the driving\":\n\nHomiletically, one could argue that the use of the word \"minhag\" in Jewish law reflects its Biblical Hebrew origins as \"the (manner of) driving (a chariot)\". Whereas \"Halakha\" (law), from the word for walking-path, means the path or road set for the journey, \"minhag\" (custom), from the word for driving, means the manner people have developed themselves to travel down that path more quickly.\n\nThe present use of \"minhag\" for custom may have been influenced by the Arabic \"minhaj\", though in current Islamic usage this term is used for the intellectual methodology of a scholar or school of thought (cf. Hebrew \"derech\") rather than for the customs of a local or ethnic community.\n\nObservant Jews consider \"Halakha\", Jewish law as derived from the Talmud, binding upon all Jews. However, in addition to these \"halakhot\", there have always been local customs and prohibitions. Some customs were eventually adopted universally (e.g. wearing a head covering) or almost universally (e.g. monogamy). Others are observed by some major segments of Jewry but not by others (e.g., not eating rice on Passover). \nThese \"minhagim\" exist in various forms: \n\nVarious sources in Rabbinic literature stress the importance of a long-held tradition, culminating in the statement \"the \"minhag\" of our fathers is [equivalent to] Torah\" (e.g. Tosafot to \"Menahot\" 20b s.v. \"nifsal\"). Custom can thus determine halachic practice in cases of disagreement among rabbinic authorities. In numerous instances, Rabbi Moses Isserles warns that one should not abolish long-held customs. (Isserles' gloss on the \"Shulchan Aruch\" was, in fact, written so as to delineate Ashkenazi \"minhagim\" alongside Sephardi practices in the same code of law.)\n\nDespite the above, a \"minhag\" does not override clear biblical or talmudic enactments, and one may not transgress the latter for the sake of the former. In fact, any \"minhag\" that intrinsically involves an element of \"halakha\" violation is considered null and void (see \"Piskei Riaz\", \"Pesachim\" 4:1:7).\n\nThe Talmud (Pesachim 50) rules that a valid \"minhag\" accepted by previous generations of a family or community is binding upon all later generations. The \"Rosh\" (Makom Shenahagu, 3) states that the Talmud's ruling fundamentally applies to practices undertaken by learned individuals; innovations by the unlearned need only be followed publicly. Other \"halakhic\" authorities hold that the Talmud's ruling applies to all valid practices initiated by either learned or unlearned individuals (for discussion of this point see \"Bach\" and \"Beit Yosef\" to Yoreh Deah 214; \"Shach\", ibid., 214:7).\n\nIn most cases, personal acceptance of a new \"minhag\" is tantamount to vowing performance of that \"minhag\". Consequently, abandonment of such a \"minhag\" typically requires \"hatarat nedarim\" or \"sh'eilat chakham\", \"halakhic\" procedures for absolving oneself from oaths. This was often necessary when, for example, an Ashkenazi Jew moved to the Ottoman Empire and wished to join the local Sephardi community.\n\nJewish law provides for a number of mechanisms to change or remove a custom when it is held to be mistaken or illogical. (See Tosafot on Talmud \"Pesachim\" 51a; Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, \"Hilchot Issurei Biah\"; \"Be'er Heitev\", Orach Chaim 182 in \"Hilchot Birkat Ha'mazon\", \"Orach Chaim\" 653 in \"Hilchot Lulav\", \"Orach Chaim\" 551:4 in \"Hilchot Tisha B'av\".) Orthodox rabbi and historian of Jewish law Menachem Elon writes:\n\nThe acute displacement brought about by World War II and the Holocaust, and the large-scale immigration to the United States, various European countries, and especially the State of Israel, have led to a \"liberal mixing\" of various \"minhagim\", and arguably the falling into disuse of certain customs. In addition, the \"baal teshuva\" movement has created a large group who have no clear tradition from their parents. In response to these phenomena, certain scholars have focused on the \"minhagim\", and attempts have been made to revive \"minhagim\" that have fallen into disuse.\n\n\"Nusach\" (properly \"nósach\") primarily means \"text\" or \"version\", the correct wording of a religious text. Thus, the \"nusach tefillah\" is the text of the prayers, either generally or as used by a particular community. In common use \"nusach\" has come to signify the entire liturgical tradition of the community, including the musical rendition. It is narrower than \"minhag\", which can refer to custom in any field, not necessarily that of communal prayer.\n\nBoth \"nusach\" and \"minhag\" can thus be used for \"liturgic rite\" or \"liturgic tradition\" though sometimes a \"nusach\" appears to be a subdivision of a \"minhag\" or vice versa; see different Jewish rites and popular siddurim under Siddur. In general one must pray according to one's \"\"nusach\" of origin\" unless one has formally joined a different community and accepted its \"minhag\". (Perisha rules that if one abandons a \"nusach\" that has been accepted universally by the wider Jewish community, his prayer is disqualified and must be repeated using the accepted \"nusach\": Arba'ah Turim, Orach Chayim, 120 ad loc).\n\nThe main segments of traditional Judaism, as differentiated by \"nusach\" (broadly and narrowly), are these:\n\n\n"}

Confectioners originally distributed an orange-flavored variety that was only available seasonally due to a lack of packaging capable of preserving the candy. In the spring, five-and-dimes sold circus peanuts as penny candy. In the 1940s, circus peanuts became one of the many candies to become available year-round owing to the industrial proliferation of cellophane packaging.\n\nAs of the 2010s, mass-produced circus peanuts are made from sugar, corn syrup, gelatin, pectin, soy protein, food coloring and artificial flavor.\n\nOver the years, confectioners have also offered circus peanuts colored yellow, pink, and white, including a variety of flavors, though orange is still the most predominant color and banana the most common flavor, by far.

It is a type of paralleloscope that uses a prism instead of a plain mirror. Its purpose was to function as an aiming point in the horizontal plane when laying for indirect fire artillery.\n\nThe prism paralleloscope entered service with the British Army in the late 1950s. It was permanently fitted in a fibre-glass case with a lid. This case was mounted on two short metal vertical poles so that it was about two feet above the ground, these vertical poles were held together by two horizontal rods slightly shorter that the paralleloscope case. Once mounted the lid of the case provided a 'canopy' above the paralleloscope. \n\nParalleloscopes entered British service in the 1920s-30s. These early versions were a mirror about three feet long and 4 inches wide, mounted on a tripod about three feet high and positioned a few yards away from and to the side of a gun on its dial sight side. Each gun in a battery had at least one. When a gun was oriented in its centre of arc it recorded the paralleloscope as one of its aiming points (other types of aiming point were a distinctive distant topographical feature or a pair of aiming posts). \n\nWith a paralleloscope the gun layer set the zero line deflection or bearing of fire on his dial sight and aimed his sight at its reflection in the paralleloscope. As the gun fire and its trail(s) bedded in and the gun moved back, the reflected image of the sight moved along the paralleloscope.

It is traditionally cooked in a round, cast iron, three-legged pot, the \"potjie\", descended from the Dutch oven brought from the Netherlands to South Africa in the 17th century and found in the homes and villages of people throughout southern Africa. The pot is heated using small amounts of wood or charcoal or, if fuel is scarce, twisted grass or even dried animal dung.\n\nThe dish is also popular in Israel, known as poike in Hebrew.\n\nTraditionally, the recipe includes meat, vegetables like carrots, cabbage, cauliflower or pumpkin, starches like rice or potatoes, all slow-cooked with Dutch-Malay spices, the distinctive spicing of South Africa's early culinary melting pot. Other common ingredients include fruits and flour-based products like pasta.\n\nPotjiekos originated with the Voortrekkers, evolving as a stew made of venison and vegetables (if available), cooked in the potjie. As \"trekkers\" (pioneers) shot wild game, it was added to the pot. The large bones were included to thicken the stew. Each day when the wagons stopped, the pot was placed over a fire to simmer. New bones replaced old and fresh meat replaced meat eaten. Game included venison, poultry such as guinea fowl, warthog, bushpig, rabbit, and hare.\n\nCooking oil is added to a \"potjie\", and placed on a fire until hot. Meat is added, typically lamb or pork. The meat is spiced and often a form of alcohol is added for flavor - mostly beer, Old Brown Sherry or a dessert wine like Humbro. The views of Afrikaner cooks in matters of seasoning tend to be conservative; garlic, for instance, is used very sparingly.\n\nWhen the meat is lightly browned, vegetables like potatoes and mealies (maize) are added, along with whatever spices are needed. Water or other liquids may or may not then be added, depending on the views of the potjie chef. The lid is then closed and the contents left to simmer slowly without stirring. This distinguishes a potjiekos from a stew that is stirred. The aim is that the flavours of the different ingredients mix as little as possible. Although some chefs may permit stirring from time to time (which is highly frowned upon), it does create a stew where all the ingredients tend to blend together and taste similar. This is also the main difference between a stew and potjiekos i.e. in a potjie you do not stir. The reason for this is so that the flavour from the meat at the bottom can flavour all the vegetables above while slow cooking. If your potjie is made properly you should still be able to see and taste all the ingredients separately as well as a delicious whole. Little sauce or water is used, so that cooking is by steam and not boiling in a sauce like a stew; thus the heat must be very low and constant. These are some of the secrets of each cook. A potjie is a social activity, with guests generally engaging in fireside chitchat while the potjie cooks, typically three to six hours.\n\nA potjie is usually accompanied by rice, pasta or something similar. \n\nIn 1998, it was reported that potjie pots with large amounts of lead were being sold, placing users at risk of lead poisoning. \n\n"}
