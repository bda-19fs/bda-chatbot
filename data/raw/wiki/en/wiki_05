The principle is intended to ensure that a replacement head of government has enough parliamentary support to govern.\n\nThe concept was first used on a national scale in West Germany, but is today also used in other nations, such as Spain, Hungary, Lesotho, Israel, Poland, Slovenia, Albania and Belgium.\n\nGovernments in the 1919 Weimar Republic were usually very unstable. As there was no election threshold for getting a seat in the Reichstag, it was possible to get a seat with as little as 0.4 percent of the vote. This resulted in a large number of parties getting seats, making it very difficult for a government to retain a majority. Under the Weimar Constitution, a Chancellor (or \"Reichskanzler\" as he was then called) would frequently be voted out of office without his successor having sufficient backing to govern. This led to a quick succession of many Chancellors in office. Many of these chancellors were forced to rely on the emergency provisions of Article 48 just to conduct the basic business of government. In the latter years of the Weimar era, this frequently led to the imposition of cabinets that were dependent on the confidence of the President, Paul von Hindenburg. This instability was helped by and seen as contributing to the rise of the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler.\n\nTo overcome this problem, two provisions were included in the 1949 German constitution, the \"Basic Law\" \"(Grundgesetz).\" They stipulate that the Chancellor, or \"Bundeskanzler\" (Federal Chancellor) as he is now called, may be removed from office by majority vote of the \"Bundestag\" (\"Federal Diet\", the lower chamber/house of the German Federal Parliament) only if a prospective successor also has the support of a majority. The relevant provisions are as follows:\n\nAs a result, the failure of a motion of confidence does not automatically force either the resignation of the cabinet or a new election. Rather, the cabinet \"may\" continue as a minority government if there is not a positive majority for a prospective successor.\n\nFor a successful motion of no confidence, a majority of the members of Bundestag is needed to elect a new chancellor. This means that not participating in the vote or abstaining has the same effect as voting \"no\". This was of specific importance in the first (unsuccessful) use of this instrument.\n\nAlso, the Federal President may dissolve the legislature \"only\" after the failure of a motion of confidence, and the legislature may not dissolve itself either. This provision is intended to limit the power of the President. One consequence of this is that in contrast to many other parliamentary democracies, the Chancellor does not petition the President to dissolve the legislature. Rather, in the past, the Chancellor deliberately loses a motion of confidence. However, this practice has been restricted by the Federal Constitutional Court since the election of Helmut Kohl in 1982.\n\nWhile Carlo Schmid is generally considered to be the main contributor to this constitutional innovation, the concept was actually first introduced after World War I in the Free State of Prussia. Its existence was a major reason why that state was governed by a centre-left coalition without interruption from 1919 to 1932.\n\nSince 1949, only two constructive votes of no confidence have been attempted, and only one has been successful.\n\nOn 27 April 1972, an attempt to vote Chancellor Willy Brandt (SPD) out of office in favor of opposition leader Rainer Barzel (CDU) failed by a margin of only two votes. This came as a surprise since it was known that several members of the SPD-FDP coalition strongly opposed Brandt's \"Ostpolitik\" and the government no longer had a clear majority after several deputies either switched over to the opposition or announced they would vote for the no-confidence motion. The numerous defections theoretically dropped the coalition to just 246 votes. The opposition nominally had 250 votes, just one vote over the 249 needed to topple Brandt. \n\nThe vote was highly influenced by tactics. To hamper their deputies from voting for Barzel in the secret ballot, the leadership of the governing parties urged its deputies not to participate in the vote; as a majority of deputies was needed for a successful vote, not participating meant in fact voting \"no\". Only the members of government and a few deputies of the governing parties voted, the first to ensure that dissenting deputies from CDU might remain secret. \n\nDespite this, Brandt believed he was finished, and the SPD had girded itself to be consigned to opposition. A number of unions went on strike in anticipation of Brandt's defeat. In the end, only 260 votes were cast: 247 with yes, 10 with no, 3 abstaining, and 236 either absent or invalid. It was thus clear that the missing votes were within the CDU faction. In June 1973, CDU member Julius Steiner admitted to \"Der Spiegel\" magazine to have abstained from voting. Later, he claimed to have received 50,000 DM in return from one of the leading SPD figures, Karl Wienand. Leo Wagner of the CSU was suspected to have received a bribe as well, but conclusive evidence could not be found. \n\nAfter the 1990 German reunification, it became clear that the bribe money that was offered to several CDU politicians came from the East German Stasi (secret police), who at the time saw a need for Brandt to stay in power. That is somewhat ironic since Brandt's \"Ostpolitik\" is today seen as one of the major steps that eventually led to the implosion of East Germany in 1989.\n\nHowever, as the government was no longer backed by a majority in parliament, on 22 September, Chancellor Brandt proposed a to the \"Bundestag\". He lost intentionally to make way for the West German federal election, 1972.\n\nOn 1 October 1982, Helmut Schmidt was successfully voted out of office in favor of Helmut Kohl, marking the end of the SPD-FDP coalition. The vote was much easier than the earlier one since it was clear that the FDP wanted to switch over to a coalition with the CDU. Indeed, the FDP was already in negotiations at the time the vote happened. The FDP was no longer content with SPD economic policy and at the same time, the SPD was internally divided over NATO stationing of nuclear missiles in Germany. Still, the vote succeeded by a majority of only seven votes.\n\nTo obtain a clearer majority in the \"Bundestag\" (which seemed to be in reach according to the polls), after the vote, Helmut Kohl put up a motion of confidence in which the new CDU-FDP coalition intentionally voted against the Chancellor that it just put into power. This trick allowed for the dissolution of the \"Bundestag\" according to Article 68 \"Grundgesetz\" (see above). Still, the action triggered an appeal to the Federal Constitutional Court, which, in a somewhat helpless ruling, upheld the move but set criteria for such motions in future. After all, the new \"Bundestag\" had already been elected in March 1983, yielding a strong majority for the new coalition, which eventually lasted until 1998.\n\nOn 22 May 2005, after the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats (CDU) in the state (land) elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder announced he would call federal elections \"as soon as possible\". Constructive vote of no confidence were not used (Article 67), instead a motion of confidence (Article 68) in Chancellor Schröder was subsequently defeated in the \"Bundestag\" on 1 July 2005 by 151 to 296 (with 148 abstaining), after Schröder urged members not to vote for his government in order to trigger new elections. The Federal Constitutional Court, once again, allowed such motion of confidence, and the Federal President dissolved the \"Bundestag\" according to the Article 68, Par. 2 of the Basic Law. The German federal elections, 2005 were held on 18 September. After the elections, neither Schröder's SPD-Green coalition nor the alliance between CDU/CSU and the FDP led by Angela Merkel achieved a majority in parliament. On October 10, it was announced that the parties had agreed to form a \"grand coalition\". Schröder agreed to cede the chancellorship to Merkel, but the SPD would hold the majority of government posts and retain considerable control of government policy. Merkel was elected Chancellor on 22 November.\n\nA very similar system to the German one exists in Spain today. It was approved in the new constitution of 1978 for the national Cortes (parliament) and also came into force in territorial assemblies (parliaments/assemblies of autonomous communities).\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Prime Minister (President of the Government) must resign if he proposes a vote of confidence to the Congress of Deputies (the lower chamber of the \"Cortes Generales\", Spanish parliament) and if he is defeated, or alternatively, if the Congress, on its own initiative, censures the government. However, when a censure motion is introduced, a prospective replacement candidate for Prime Minister must be nominated at the same time. If the censure motion carries, the replacement candidate is deemed to have the confidence of the Congress of Deputies and thus automatically ascends as Prime Minister.\n\nAs with the German Basic Law, the term \"constructive vote of no confidence\" does not actually appear in the Spanish constitution. The relevant provisions are as follows:\n\n1. The Congress of Deputies may require political responsibility from the Government by adopting a motion of censure (no confidence) by overall (absolute) majority of its Members.\n\n2. The motion of censure (no confidence) must be proposed by at least one tenth of the Members of Congress of Deputies and shall include a candidate for the office of the Presidency of the Government.\n\n3. The motion of censure (no confidence) may not be voted until five days after it has been submitted. \nDuring the first two days of this period, alternative motions may be submitted.\n\n4. If the motion of censure (no confidence) is not adopted by the Congress of Deputies, its signatories may not submit another during the same period of sessions.\n\n1. If the Congress of Deputies withholds its confidence from the Government, the latter shall submit its resignation to the King, whereafter the President of the Government shall be nominated in accordance with the provisions of Article 99.\n\n2. If the Congress of Deputies adopts a motion of censure (no confidence), the Government shall present its resignation to the King and the candidate included in it shall be understood to have the confidence of the Chamber for the purposes provided in section 99. The King shall appoint him President of the Government.\n\nSince the enactment of the 1978 Constitution, there have been four attempted constructive votes of no confidence. The first successful vote came on 1 June 2018, when Mariano Rajoy was voted out in favour of Pedro Sánchez.\n\nThe unicameral National Assembly could not remove the Prime Minister of Hungary unless a prospective successor was nominated at the same time. \n\nSince 2012 new constitution named Fundamental Law has been in force and it has same regulation of the motion of no confidence.\n\nIn March 2009 the prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsány, announced he would hand over his position to a politician with a higher support of the parties of the Hungarian parliament. The Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) opposed most candidates for the post proposed by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), but on 30 March 2009, Gordon Bajnai managed to get the backing of both parties. A constructive motion of no confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány took place on 14 April. Bajnai became Prime Minister.\n\nCurrent Fundamental Law of Hungary (new Constitution of Hungary adopted in 2011) has similar provisions that allow only constructive vote of no confidence by the absolute majority of the unicameral National Assembly (parliament) members.\n\n(1) One-fifth of the Members of the National Assembly may, together with the designation of a candidate for the office of Prime Minister, submit a written motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister.\n\n(2) If the National Assembly supports the motion of no-confidence, it thereby expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister and simultaneously elects the person proposed for the office of Prime Minister in the motion of no-confidence. For such decision of the National Assembly, the votes of more than half of the Members of the National Assembly shall be required.\n\n(3) The Prime Minister may put forward a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if more than half of the Members of the National Assembly do not support the Prime Minister in the confidence vote proposed by the Prime Minister.\n\n(4) The Prime Minister may propose that the vote on a proposal submitted by the Government be simultaneously a confidence vote. The National Assembly expresses its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister if it does not support the proposal submitted by the Government.\n\n(5) The National Assembly shall decide on the question of confidence after the third day, but no later than eight days following the submission of the motion of no-confidence or of the Prime Minister’s motion pursuant to Paragraphs (3) or (4).\n\nSubsection (8) of section 87 of the Constitution of Lesotho stipulates that a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister of Lesotho is of no effect unless the National Assembly nominates one of its members to be appointed prime minister in place of the incumbent:\n\nThe constructive vote of no confidence has been in place since the direct election of the Prime Minister of Israel was abolished in 2001. By a vote of no confidence the Knesset\n(parliament) did not elect new prime minister but only proposed a \"formateur\": a presumptive nominee charged with seeking to form a new government. The candidate proposed then might or might not secure a positive vote of confidence before becoming prime minister. The system, therefore, did not guarantee continuity in the same way as the constructive vote of no confidence was used in Germany and elsewhere. Amendment No. I of the Basic Law of Government 2001 removed the \"formateur\", switching to a conventional constructive vote of no confidence. The Basic Law of Government 2001 provides in Section 28 (b):\n\nThe Constitution of Poland (1997) states that the \"Sejm\" (lower chamber of the National Assembly) may remove the Council of Ministers (cabinet) only by a resolution \n(adopted by absolute majority of the \"Sejm\" members), which specifies the name of the new Prime Minister (President of the Council of Ministers).\n\nThe Sejm shall pass a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers by a majority of votes of the statutory number of Deputies, on a motion moved by at least 46 Deputies and that shall specify the name of a candidate for Prime Minister. If such a resolution has been passed by the Sejm, the President of the Republic shall accept the resignation of the Council of Ministers and appoint a new Prime Minister as chosen by the Sejm, and, on his application, the other members of the Council of Ministers and accept their oath of office.\n\nA motion to pass a resolution referred to in para. 1 above, may be put to a vote no sooner than 7 days after it has been submitted. A subsequent motion of a like kind may be submitted no sooner than after the end of 3 months from the day the previous motion was submitted.\n\nThe Constitution of Albania (1998 as amended in 2008 and 2012) stipulates also that only constructive vote of no confidence may be adopted by the absolute majority of the unicameral Assembly (parliament) deputies.\n\n1. The Prime Minister has the right to submit to the Assembly a motion of confidence in the Council of Ministers. If the motion of confidence is voted by fewer than half of all the members of the Assembly, within 48 hours from the voting on the motion, the Prime Minister asks the President of the Republic to dissolve the Assembly.\n\n2. The President dissolves the Assembly within 10 days from receipt of the request. A request for a motion of confidence may not be submitted during the period when a motion of no confidence according to article 105 is being examined.\n\n3. The motion may not be voted on unless three days have passed from its submission.\n\n1. One fifth of the deputies have the right to submit for voting in the Assembly a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister in office, proposing a new Prime Minister.\n\n2. The Assembly may vote a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister only by electing a new Prime Minister with the votes of more than half of all its members.\n\n3. The President of the Republic decrees the discharge of the Prime Minister in office and the appointment of the elected Prime Minister no later than 10 days from the voting on the motion in the Assembly.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Slovenia (1991 as amended in 1997, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2013) the National Assembly (\"Državni zbor\", lower chamber of the Slovenian parliament) may pass a motion of no confidence in the Government only by constructive vote of no confidence.\n\nThe National Assembly may pass a vote of no confidence in the Government only by electing a new President of the Government on the proposal of at least ten deputies and by a majority vote of all deputies. The incumbent President of the Government is thereby dismissed, but together with his ministers he must continue to perform his regular duties until the swearing in of a new Government.\n\nNo less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the lodging of a proposal to elect a new President of the Government and the vote itself, unless the National Assembly decides otherwise by a two-thirds majority vote of all deputies, or if the country is at war or in a state of emergency.\n\nWhere the President of the Government has been elected on the basis of the fourth paragraph of Article 111, a vote of no confidence is expressed in him if on the proposal of at least ten deputies, the National Assembly elects a new President of the Government by a majority of votes cast.\n\nThe President of the Government may require a vote of confidence in the Government. If the Government does not receive the support of a majority vote of all deputies, within thirty days the National Assembly must elect a new President of the Government or in a new vote express its confidence in the incumbent President of the Government, or failing this, the President of the Republic dissolves the National Assembly and calls new elections. The President of the Government may tie the issue of confidence to the adoption of a law or to some other decision in the National Assembly. If such decision is not adopted, it is deemed that a vote of no confidence in the Government has been passed.\n\nNo less than forty-eight hours must elapse between the requirement of a vote of confidence and the vote itself.\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium adopted constructive vote of no confidence in the Constitution of Belgium (1994 coordinated text) article considering the dissolution of parliament.\n\n(1) The King has only the right to dissolve the Chamber of Representatives if the latter, with the absolute majority of its members:\n\n1) either rejects a motion of confidence in the federal Government and does not propose to the King, within three days from the day of the rejection of the motion, the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister;\n\n2) or adopts a motion of disapproval (no confidence) with regard to the federal Government and does not simultaneously propose to the King the nomination of a successor to the Prime Minister.\n\n(2) The motions of confidence and disapproval can only be voted on after a delay of forty-eight hours after the introduction of the motion.\n\n(3) Moreover, the King may, in the event of the resignation of the federal Government, dissolve the Chamber of Representatives after having received its agreement expressed by the absolute majority of its members.\n\n(4) The dissolution of the Chamber of Representatives entails the dissolution of the Senate.\n\n(5) The act of dissolution involves the convoking of the electorate within forty days and of the Chambers within two months.\n\nIn partisan Westminster systems, a constructive vote of no confidence is normally not required. A prime minister faced with a vote of no confidence must either resign immediately or request a dissolution of parliament and fresh elections. This system is normally stable because strong political parties in the Westminster system ensure a very small number of viable candidates to replace a prime minister, and also ensures frequent and stable majority governments.\n\nHowever, this was not always the case historically, especially in Westminster systems without clearly defined political parties. In such circumstances, it was often the case that the sitting prime minister would be unpopular with parliamentarians but also might not have a viable successor who could have a better command of the parliament. In such cases, it was informally expected that parliament refrain from a vote of no confidence unless there was a reasonably obvious successor, in which case the prime minister would usually be expected to resign without recourse to fresh elections.\n\nOn the other hand, if a prime minister in a nonpartisan Westminster system sustained a vote of no confidence in spite of the lack of an obviously viable successor then depending on the circumstances he might have up to two alternatives to resignation: call fresh elections or attempt to continue governing in spite of the non-confidence vote.\n\n"}

Its earlier meaning in English was as a synonym for sauerkraut, a traditional Central and Eastern European food.\n\nIn German, the term means \"herb\", or designates the leaves and stem of a plant as opposed to the root. The term is more often used in compound nouns for herbs, and also for cabbage and cabbage products:\n\n\nThe plural \"Kräuter\" is commonly used (herbs, weeds), but when talking about spices, the singular is often replaced by \"Gewürz\" which can refer to any spice.\n\nAlthough recorded as a colloquial term for Germans by the mid-nineteenth century, it was during World War I that \"Kraut\" came to be used in English as a derogatory term for a German. In World War II it was used mainly by American soldiers and less so by British soldiers, who preferred the terms Jerry or Fritz. It is considered offensive by Germans.\n\nThe stereotype of the sauerkraut-eating German dates back long before this time, and can be seen, for example, in Jules Verne's depiction of the evil German industrialist Schultz, an avid sauerkraut eater, in \"The Begum's Fortune\". The 'blissful odours' of Sauerkraut are mentioned in the satirical epic poem \"Germany. A Winter's Tale\" published in 1844 by Heinrich Heine.\n\nThe Bauer Krauts were an atom-level hockey team based in Kitchener, Ontario (known as \"Berlin, Ontario\" prior to the outbreak of the First World War) in the twentieth century.\n\nKrautrock is a popularly accepted term for a form of experimental German prog rock of the late 1960s and 1970s. Krautrock was typified by acts such as Amon Düül, Kraftwerk, Neu!, Tangerine Dream, Faust, Can and David Bowie on his \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums \"Low\", \"\"Heroes\"\", and \"Lodger\", as well as many others.\n\nKraut was the name of a New York punk rock band in the 1980s. Their song \"All Twisted\" was the first independent video to air on MTV.\n\n\"Magic Kraut\" is the name of a song in the album \"Fresh\" by Teddybears.\n\nIndustrial rock band KMFDM’s song “Kraut” appears on the b-side of their “Juke Joint Jezebel” single, and on their \"Extra, Vol. 3\" compilation.\n\n\"Krauts with Attitude\" is the title of the record released in Germany in 1991 which is credited for playing a prominent role in establishing the German hip hop scene.\n\nThe Swedish indie rock band Peter Bjorn and John composed the track titled \"School of Kraut\".\n\n"}
{"id": "218856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218856", "title": "United States trademark law", "text": "United States trademark law\n\nA trademark is a word, phrase, or logo that identifies the source of goods or services. Trademark law protects a business' commercial identity or brand by discouraging other businesses from adopting a name or logo that is \"confusingly similar\" to an existing trademark. The goal is to allow consumers to easily identify the producers of goods and services and avoid confusion.\n\nUnited States trademark law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. Common law trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marks—both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).\n\nUnited States law has protected trademarks under state common law since colonial times, but it was not until 1870 that Congress first attempted to establish a federal trademark regime. This 1870 statute was purported to be an exercise of Congress' Copyright Clause powers, however, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the \"Trade-Mark Cases.\" In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905.\n\nIn 1946, Congress passed the Lanham Act (). The Lanham Act defines federal trademark protection and trademark registration rules. The Lanham Act grants the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") administrative authority over trademark registration.\n\nState law continues to add its own protection, complementing (and complicating) the federal trademark system.\n\nRecent developments in U.S. trademark law have included the adoption of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (see Trademark dilution), the 1999 Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, and the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (see Trademark dilution).\n\nTrademark law protects a company's goodwill, and helps consumers easily identify the source of the things they purchase. \nIn principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark, reduces the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions, for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item—the item with this mark—is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby encourages the production of quality products and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. [internal punctuation omitted]\n\nU.S. Trademark rights come in two types: common law and federal registration.\n\n™ – Signifies common law trademark rights. Businesses automatically receive common law trademark rights by using a brand name or logo in the normal course of commerce.\n\n® – Signifies a registered trademark. The ® symbol may only be used on a trademark that has been examined, approved and \"registered\" with the USPTO.\n\nTrademark rights are acquired through use of a mark in the normal course of commerce. For example, by using a brand name or logo on a product or its retail packaging.\n\nA word, phrase, or logo can act as a trademark. But so can a slogan, a name, a scent, the shape of a product's container, and a series of musical notes.\nThe language of the Lanham Act describes that universe [of things that can qualify as a trademark] in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks \"includ[e] any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof.\" § 1127. Since human beings might use as a \"symbol\" or \"device\" almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particular sound (of NBC's three chimes), and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread).\n\nSome trademarks afford more potent rights than others. The closer the relationship between the mark and the goods, the weaker the mark. Trademarks are often separated into 4 categories of distinctiveness: \n\nWhere there is no logical relationship between the mark and the goods or services, trademark protection is at its strongest. Arbitrary and fanciful marks are considered inherently distinctive and are prima facia registrable. For example, \"coined words\" – such as Kodak, Polaroid, or Starbucks – are considered fanciful and receive strong trademark protection. Arbitrary marks include preexisting words used in an arbitrary way, such as \"Apple\" when used for computers.\n\nSuggestive trademarks are still broadly protected. These marks \"suggest\" something about the product or services they are used on. The suggestion is a subtle connotation, not an outright description of the product. An example is \"Whirlpool\" for washing machines.\n\nDescriptive terms immediately describe the goods, or some important characteristic of the goods. Trademark law does not protect descriptive terms unless achieve \"secondary meaning\" in the minds of consumers. That is, trademark rights accrue when the public comes to associate the descriptive term with a \"particular company\" rather than the \"product in general\".\n\nThe generic term for a product or service cannot be trademarked. Granting trademark rights on a generic term-say \"apple\" for use on apple juice-puts other companies at an unfair competitive disadvantage. Every company has the right to describe its products and services using generic terms.\n\nOnce acquired, trademark rights may be registered with the USPTO. \"The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to \"register\" a trademark, 15 U.S.C. § 1052, and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, § 1114(1).\"\n\nTrademark protection depends on use in commerce, not registration. Both registered and non-registered trademarks are both eligible for protection under the Lanham Act. However, registration (on the \"Principal Register\") affords several advantages: \n\nTrademarks may be registered online. The USPTO charges a $275 fee for online trademark applications. The process takes about 6 months from initial application to final registration. It is a general practice to hire a trademark lawyer to file the application on behalf of the future owner.\n\nOnce the application is filed, it sits in a queue for a few months. Eventually, a USPTO Trademark Examiner will examine the application according to the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure. If the Trademark Examiner identifies problems with the applications, the applicant will be sent a \"preliminary rejection.\" The applicant will then have 6 months to file a reply with arguments in favor of her trademark application. If the Trademark Examiner is persuaded by the reply arguments, the application will be granted registration. If not, a \"final rejection\" will be issued.\n\nWhen an application is allowed, it moves on to \"publication\" in the \"Trademark Official Gazette\". Once published, there is a 30-day opportunity for other companies to appeal the registration. If no appeal is filed, the registration is finally issued.\n\nIf the registration receives a final rejection from the Trademark Examiner, the applicant may appeal the rejection to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Likewise, if the application is opposed by a third party, the appeal will be reviewed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.\n\nAn application for registration may be based upon \"actual use\" in commerce (a §1(a) registration) or upon a \"bona fide\" intent to use (\"ITU\") the mark in commerce (§1(b) registration). An ITU application is a placeholder. It will not be allowed to register until the applicant actually begins using the mark in interstate commerce. The value of ITU is in establishing \"priority\"—that is, determining which business first acquired the trademark rights.\n\nThe benefits of federal trademark registration only accrue to marks listed on the \"Primary Register\". To be eligible for the Principal Register, a mark must be recognized as a trademark, and not just a description of some goods or services. Eligible marks include (a) arbitrary or fanciful marks, (b) \"suggestive\" marks, and (c) descriptive marks that have achieved \"secondary meaning\" or \"distinctiveness.\"\n\nThe Supplemental Register is for \"descriptive\" marks that have not yet become distinctive. Descriptive marks describe some quality of the goods or services they are used with. Descriptive marks may become distinctive (acquire \"secondary meaning\") through 5 years of use in commerce, or through evidence of heavy advertising and market recognition.\n\nSecondary meaning is acquired when in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature... is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\n\nNote that \"generic\" terms are ineligible for trademark protection altogether, and may not be registered on either the Primary or Supplemental Registers.\n\nTrademarks may also be registered at the state level. State registrations are less potent than federal trademark registration. But federal registration requires use of the mark in interstate commerce. If a mark is only used in one particular state, registration at the state level may be appropriate. State trademark registration is usually by filing an application with the Secretary of State of the relevant state.\n\nTrademark infringement is measured by the so-called \"likelihood of confusion\" test. A new trademark will infringe on an existing one if the new one is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.\n\nThe likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors, including:\n\n\nThis multi-factor test was articulated by Judge Henry Friendly in \"Polaroid v. Polarad\". and are often referred to as the \"Polaroid Factors\".\n\nNote that other factors may also be considered in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists. \"Even this extensive catalogue does not exhaust the possibilities—the court may have to take still other variables into account.\"\n\nConsistent with the limited nature of trademark protection and the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment, U.S. law provides for a fair use defense to trademark infringement. Fair use in trademark law does not employ the same four-pronged analysis used in copyright law. The law recognizes two fair use defenses: classic fair use, where the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products; and nominative fair use, in which the trademark is being used to actually refer to the trademarked product or trademark owner.\n\nThese uses are still subject to the requirement that there be no consumer confusion as to source or sponsorship. Trademarks may also be lawfully used in parodies, since in that case there is usually no likelihood of confusion.\n\nIn contrast to copyright or patent law, trademark protection does not have a set duration or definite expiration date. Trademark rights only expire when the owner stops using the mark in commerce. However, federal trademark registrations expire ten years after the registration date, unless renewed within one year prior to the expiration.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution specifically grants Congress power over copyright and patent law, but not over trademark law. Instead, Congress' power to create federal trademark law is derived from the Commerce Clause. Therefore, there must be some degree of interstate commerce present for a trademark to receive Lanham Act protection. The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the first federal trademark law by finding that Congress could not stretch the Copyright Clause to cover trademarks,\n\nUnlike copyright law which provides for criminal penalties as well as civil damages, trademark law in the United States is almost entirely enforced through private lawsuits. The exception is in the case of criminal counterfeiting of goods. Otherwise, the responsibility is entirely on the mark owner to file suit in either state or federal civil court in order to restrict an infringing use. Failure to \"police\" a mark by stopping infringing uses can result in the loss of protection.\n\n\n"}

Generally, it's thought to have a vaguely cherry-banana flavor.\n\nIn modern chewing gum, if natural rubber such as chicle is used, it must pass several purity and cleanliness tests. However, most modern types of chewing gum use synthetic gum based materials. These materials allow for longer lasting flavor, a better texture, and a reduction in tackiness.\n\nIn 1928, Walter Diemer, an accountant for the Fleer Chewing Gum Company in Philadelphia, was experimenting with new gum recipes. One recipe, based on a formula for a chewing gum called \"Blibber Blubber\", was found to be less sticky than regular chewing gum, and stretched more easily. It was a dingy grey color, so Diemer added red dye (diluted to pink), that being what he had on hand at the time. This gum became highly successful and was eventually named by the president of Fleer as Dubble Bubble because of its stretchy texture. The original bubble gum was pink in color because that was the dye that Diemer had most on hand at the time.\n\nThis remained the dominant kind of bubble gum until after WWII, when Bazooka bubble gum entered the market.\n\nUntil the 1970s, bubble gum still tended to stick to one's face. At that time, synthetic gum was introduced, which would almost never stick as a bubble popped. The two first brands in the US were Hubba Bubba and Bubble Yum.\n\nIn taste tests, children tend to prefer strawberry and blue raspberry flavors, rejecting more complex flavors as they say these make them want to swallow the gum rather than continue chewing.\n\nIn 1996, Susan Montgomery Williams of Fresno, California set the Guinness World Record for largest bubblegum bubble ever blown, which was in diameter. Chad Fell holds the record for \"Largest Hands-free Bubblegum Bubble\" at , achieved on 24 April 2004.\n\n"}

Trail mix is considered an ideal snack food for hikes, because it is lightweight, easy to store, and nutritious, providing a quick energy boost from the carbohydrates in the dried fruit or granola, and sustained energy from fats in nuts.\n\nThe combination of nuts, raisins and chocolate as a trail snack dates at least to the 1910s, when outdoorsman Horace Kephart recommended it in his popular camping guide.\n\nIn New Zealand, trail mix is known as \"scroggin\" or \"schmogle\". The term is also used in some places in Australia but usage has only been traced back to the 1970s. Some claim that the name stands for sultanas, carob, raisins, orange peel, grains, glucose, imagination, and nuts or alternatively sultanas, chocolate, raisins and other goody-goodies including nuts; but this may be a false etymology.\n\nThe American word \"gorp\", a term for trail mix often used by hikers in North America, is typically said to be an acronym for \"good old raisins and peanuts\", or its common ingredients \"granola, oats, raisins, peanuts,\" although the mix may contain M&M's and other nuts rather than oats and granola. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites a 1913 reference to the verb \"gorp\", meaning \"to eat greedily.\"\n\nIn Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and several other European countries, trail mix is called \"student fodder\", \"student oats\", or \"student mix\" in the local languages.

{"id": "225765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225765", "title": "Bratwurst", "text": "Bratwurst\n\nBratwurst () is a type of German sausage made from veal, beef, or most commonly pork. The name is derived from the Old High German \"Brätwurst\", from \"brät-\", finely chopped meat, and \"Wurst\", sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb \"braten\", to pan fry or roast.\n\nWhile sausage recipes can be found as early as 228 AD, the first documented evidence of the \"Bratwurst\" in Germany dates to 1313 and can be found in the Franconian city of Nuremberg, which is still an internationally renowned center for the production of grilling sausages.\n\nRecipes for the sausage vary by region and even locality; some sources list over 40 different varieties of German bratwurst, many of the best known originating in Franconia (today for the most part situated in northern Bavaria, but still culturally quite distinct), its northern neighbour Thuringia and adjacent areas. How the sausages are served is also locally different, but most commonly they are regarded as a snack served with or in a white bread roll made from wheat flour and eaten with mustard. As a pub dish, it is often accompanied by sauerkraut or potato salad and sometimes served with dark, crusty country bread made predominantly from rye flour, less commonly with a \"Brezel\" (pretzel). It is a very popular form of fast food in German-speaking countries, often cooked and sold by street vendors from small stands.\n\nThe Franconian sausage is a relatively long (), thick, coarse sausage, common to the whole Franconian region with slight variations. It dates back to 1313. With marjoram as a characteristic ingredient, it is close in taste to the \"Nürnberger Bratwurst\" but juicier, due to its size and coarseness. The \"Fränkische Bratwurst\" is traditionally served with sauerkraut or potato salad.\n\n\"Bratwurst\" originating in the city of Coburg in Franconia was first documented there in 1498. It is made from pork and a minimum of 15% beef, seasoned with only salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon zest, and bound with raw egg. It is coarse in texture and is about long. Traditionally, it is grilled over pinecones and served in a bread roll (\"Brötchen\").\n\nThe \"Kulmbacher Bratwurst\" is a finely-ground Rohwurst from the city of Kulmbach in Upper Franconia. Long and thin, it is made mostly from very finely ground veal, with very little pork. This sausage may be seasoned with salt, white pepper, nutmeg, lemon peel, marjoram, caraway, and garlic. The exact mixture is a closely guarded trade secret of each butcher. Kulmbacher bratwursts are usually pan-fried, or grilled over a wood fire. They are sold and served freshly grilled from vendors' stands in the Marktplatz, in pairs, with or without mustard, on crusty rolls sprinkled with anise.\n\nThe small, thin bratwurst from Franconia's largest city, Nuremberg, was first documented in 1567; it is long, and weighs between 20 and 25 g. The denominations \"Nürnberger Bratwurst\" and \"Nürnberger Rostbratwurst\" (\"Rost\" comes from the grill above the cooking fire) are Protected Geographical Indications (PGI) under EU law since 2003, and may therefore only be produced in the city of Nürnberg, where an \"Association for the Protection of \"Nürnberger Bratwürste\"\" was established in 1997.\n\nPork-based and typically seasoned with fresh marjoram which gives them their distinctive flavour, these sausages are traditionally grilled over a beechwood fire. As a main dish three to six pairs are served on a pewter plate with either sauerkraut or potato salad, and accompanied by a dollop of horseradish or mustard. They are also sold as a snack by street vendors as \"Drei im Weckla\" (three in a bun; the spelling \"Drei im Weggla\" is also common, \"Weggla\"/\"Weckla\" being the word for \"bread roll\" in the Nuremberg dialect), with mustard.\n\nAnother way of cooking Nuremberg sausages is in a spiced vinegar and onion stock; this is called \"Blaue Zipfel\" (blue lobes).\n\nThe \"Würzburger Bratwurst\", also known as the \"Winzerbratwurst\", comes from the city of Würzburg in Franconia. Its size is similar to the \"Thüringer Rostbratwurst\", but its ingredients include white Franken-Wine.\n\nThe \"Thüringer Rostbratwurst\" is a spicy sausage from Thuringia. It is thin and long. It is traditionally grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten with mustard and bread. The name \"Thüringer Rostbratwurst\" is also recognised as a PGI under EU law.\n\nTriggered by the discovery in 2000 of an account entry of 1404 first mentioning the \"Bratwurst\" in Thuringia in the town of Arnstadt, the association \"Friends of the \"Thuringian Bratwurst\"\" was founded in 2006. In the same year, the association established the \"Erstes Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum\" (First German Bratwurst Museum) in the village of Holzhausen. A two-metre-high wooden monument of a \"Bratwurst\" in a bun on a local traffic roundabout advertises the museum.\n\nThe -long \"Nordhessische Bratwurst\" (from northern Hessen) is similar to the \"Thüringer Rostbratwurst\" in taste. It is made from coarsely ground pork and is heavily seasoned. Traditionally, it is grilled over a wood fire and served on a cut-open roll with mustard.\n\nThe \"Rote Wurst\" (red sausage) is a favorite \"Bratwurst\" of the Swabian region. It is similar to the \"Bockwurst\", and is made from finely ground pork and bacon. Its taste is spicy. To prevent splitting during grilling or pan frying, an X is cut into the ends of the sausage, which opens during cooking. Sometimes a row of x-shaped cuts are made along its length.\n\nIn 1438, bratwurst started to become popular in eastern Switzerland, especially in St. Gallen. \"St. Galler bratwurst\" has been famous since then. You can find shops which sell St. Galler bratwurst with a round bread (German: \"bürli\") on the street, also served in the restaurant with hash browns (German: \"rösti\").\n\nBratwurst, often shortened to \"brat\" in American English, is a common type of sausage in the United States, especially in the state of Wisconsin, where the largest ancestry group is German. Originally brought to North America by German immigrants, it is a common sight at summer cookouts, alongside the more famous hot dog. Wisconsin is also the home of the \"beer brat\", a regional favorite where the bratwurst are simmered in beer (generally a mixture of a pilsner style beer with butter and onions) prior to grilling over charcoal.\n\nBratwurst was popularized in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin in the 1920s. In general, each local butcher shop would take orders and hand make bratwurst fresh to be picked up on a particular day. The fat content of the sausages was substantial, making daily pick up necessary to avoid spoilage; some of the fat is lost on cooking over charcoal. \nBratwurst has also become popular as a mainstay of sports stadiums, especially baseball parks, after Bill Sperling introduced bratwurst to Major League Baseball in Milwaukee County Stadium in 1954. The brats, which sold for 35 cents, were grilled and placed into a container of a special tomato sauce with green pepper and onions before being served. The bratwurst were such a hit, Sperling said, that Duke Snider of the Brooklyn Dodgers took a case back to New York City. Miller Park in Milwaukee sells more bratwurst than hot dogs.\n\nEvery year, during the Memorial Day weekend, the city of Madison, Wisconsin hosts the Brat Fest, which is billed as the \"world's largest bratwurst festival.\"\n\nThe town of Bucyrus, Ohio (which calls itself the \"Bratwurst Capital of America\") has held the three-day Bucyrus Bratwurst Festival annually since 1967.\n\n\n"}

A fundamental purpose of advancement is the self-confidence a young man or woman acquires from his participation in Scouting. Advancement is one of the methods used in the \"Aims of Scouting\"– character development, citizenship training and personal fitness.\n\nThere are separate advancement and recognition programs for the main program divisions: Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, Venturing, and Sea Scouting (and, formerly, Varsity Scouting). Each program is designed for its age group and goals.\n\nAdvancement is one of the methods used to promote the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Everything a Cub Scout does in the advancement program is intended to achieve these aims and aid in personal growth. For advancement, the program has a rank system of Lion, Bobcat, Tiger Cub, Wolf, Bear, Webelos and the Arrow of Light, which are age/grade-based ranks.\n\nThe advancement program for Boy Scouts has two phases. The first phase of Scout to First Class is designed to teach the boy Scoutcraft skills, how to participate in a group and to learn self-reliance. Scout is the joining rank, and is awarded when the Scout demonstrates a rudimentary knowledge of the Scouting ideals. Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class have progressively harder requirements in the areas of Scoutcraft, physical fitness, citizenship, personal growth and Scout Spirit.\n\nFocus turns toward individual achievement, leadership and community service once First Class is earned. The ranks of Star, Life and Eagle require a set number of merit badges (minimum of 21 for Eagle Scout, with 13 from a compulsory list), as well as a minimum of time spent in a troop leadership position, and community service requirements, among other things. The rank of Eagle Scout requires the Scout plan, develop and lead their own service project that benefits their community or an organization other than Scouting. In 2010, the Life Scout rank added a specific teaching requirement, where a Star-rank Scout must teach a younger Scout certain requirements for one of the early ranks.\n\nSeveral religious emblems programs are administered by various religious institutions and recognized by the BSA. These are generally recognized by a medal and an embroidered square knot. Many other advancement and recognitions—such as the 50-Miler Award, Crime Prevention Awards, Emergency Preparedness Award and World Conservation Award —are available to Scouts who show performance in special areas.\n\nDen Chiefs may earn the Den Chief Service Award or the Webelos Den Chief Service Award.\n\nThere are also several positions of responsibility within each troop, which is usually divided into patrols, with patrol leaders and assistant patrol leaders. The troop itself has a senior patrol leader as its youth leader, along with an assistant senior patrol leader, and several other positions of responsibility, such as scribe, quartermaster, librarian, instructor, historian and chaplain's aide. Holding some sort of responsibility in the troop is a requirement for higher advancement ranks.\n\nThe Order of the Arrow (OA) is a program of the Boy Scout division of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). It is the BSA's national honor society for experienced campers, based on American Indian traditions, and dedicated to the ideal of cheerful service.\n\nAwards are separate and distinct from the membership levels of Ordeal and Brotherhood. Awards available through the Order of the Arrow include: Vigil Honor, Founder's Award, Distinguished Service Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Red Arrow Award, E. Urner Goodman Camping Award, E. Urner Goodman, Scholarship Fund, National Service Award. Scholastic awards are also available to Arrowmen to aid in education expenses.\n\nAdvancement was a key part of the Varsity program. Varsity Scouts could earn any award or recognition that were available to Boy Scouts, including merit badges, ranks advancements, and other awards. There were also several awards that were only available to Varsity Scouts, and sometimes their leaders. Due to the decision by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to cease participation in the Varsity Scouting program, the Boy Scouts of America decided to end the Varsity Scouting program, effective January 1, 2018.\n\nA Bronze Award may be earned for each category of arts and hobbies, outdoor, community and religious life, sea Scouting and sports. After earning at least one Bronze Award and meeting tenure, leadership, personal growth and other requirements the Venturer may earn the Gold Award. To earn the Silver Award, the Venturer must earn the Gold Award, earn first aid and CPR certifications, show leadership and participate in ethics training.\n\nVenturers may also earn expert awards that build on some areas of the Bronze Awards.\nThese include the Venturing Ranger Award (Outdoors);\nthe TRUST Award (Community and Religious Life);\nthe Quest Award (Sports);\nand the Quartermaster Award (Sea Scouting).\n\nMale members under the age of 18 may also earn Merit Badges and the Star, Life, and Eagle Scout ranks from the Boy Scouting program if they have earned at least First Class rank in a Boy Scout troop or Varsity Scout team.\n\nBoth youth and adults are eligible for the Venturing Leadership Award. There are three levels of these awards: council (for those at the crew, district, and/or council levels), region (for those at the area or region levels) and National. A limited number of these awards are presented on an annual basis to involved in Venturing who have made exceptional contributions to Venturing at their particular level and who exemplify the Venturing Code. These awards are similar in scope to the Silver Beaver Award, Silver Antelope Award, and Silver Buffalo Award.\n\nIn Sea Scouts, the traditional advancement program consists of the 4 ranks in the following order Apprentice, Ordinary, Able, and finally Quartermaster. Quartermaster is the highest Sea Scout Rank and is equivalent to Eagle Scout or Venturing Silver Award.\n\nSEAL Training, (Sea Scout Experience Advanced Leadership Training ), is the highest level of Leadership Training. The program originated in 1996 and at the time was under the name of Sea Exploring, however in 1998 when Venturing was formed the organization was known as Sea Scouts. The name SEAL training did not change. There are about 4-6 course per year held around the country. Participants age over 14.5 to less than 18 years old. Participants must have earned the rank of Ordinary before attending the course. Approximately 80% of participants pass the course. The course is similar to NAYLE or what was previously known as NJLIC. Upon successful graduation from the course the student may wear the SEAL Pin on their uniform. This is the only youth earned pin that an Adult may wear.\n\nSea Scouts may choose to earn any Venturing awards, advancement, and training if they wish to. A male Sea Scout who has earned the rank of 1st Class in a Boy Scout Troop may complete further Boy Scout ranks and training from within his Sea Scout Ship.\n\n\nBSA's \"National Court of Honor\" is responsible for lifesaving and meritorious awards. All Courts of Honor for Eagle Scout rank are convened as National Courts of Honor also.\n\n\nThese STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) awards are for all three levels of youth scouting. Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers may all earn up to four Nova awards, each based on one of the four STEM principles. The Supernova award is a culmination of the youth's work on the Nova award and there are a number of various Supernova awards that the scout may earn.\n\nCub Scout leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Cub Scout Den Leader Training Award is available for Den Leaders, the Scouter's Training Award is for any registered Cub Scout leader, and the Scouter's Key is for Cubmasters. These awards are recognized by a certificate and an embroidered square knot insignia with the appropriate square knot device pin (indicates program or rank for which the award was earned).\n\nBoy Scout adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Boy Scout Leader's Training Award is available to any leader, while the Scoutmaster's Key and the Scoutmaster Award of Merit are only available to the Scoutmaster.\n\nAdult Varsity leaders may earn the Varsity Letter and activity pins. They meet the same requirements as the youth and must also complete Fast Start and Basic Leader Training (New Leader Essentials and Varsity Coach Leader Specific Training), attend six Varsity Roundtables, and complete a minimum of six months tenure.\n\nVarsity Scout leaders who complete tenure, training and performance requirements may earn the Varsity Scout Leader Training Award. Varsity Coaches may earn the Varsity Coach's Key and the National President's Varsity Scout Coach Award of Merit.\n\nVenturing adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Venturing Leader's Training Award is available to any leader, while the Venturing Advisor's Key and Venturing Advisor Award of Merit are only available to the Advisor.\n\nSea Scout adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Sea Scout Leader's Training Award (part of the Scouter's Training Award series) is available to any leader, while the Skipper's Key is only available to Skippers. Seabadge is an advanced leadership program for all Sea Scout leaders. Seabadge can be worn as a pin or a knot with a single trident. Unofficial knots with multiple tridents are sometimes worn to represent a staff member or course director.\n\nSea Scout adult leaders may also wear the SEAL pin if they, earned it as a youth, served as course director, or served as a course director's mate.\n\nSea Scout adult leaders may also receive the Venturing Leadership Award\n\nCommissioners who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Arrowhead Honor is for commissioners who exhibit quality performance and leadership. The Roundtable Staff Training Award (part of the Scouter's Training Award series) is available to Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Varsity Scout and Venturing roundtable staff. The Commissioner's Key (part of the Scouter's Key series) is available for roundtable commissioners, district commissioner, assistant district commissioners, unit commissioners, council commissioners and assistant council commissioners. The Distinguished Commissioner Service Award recognizes commissioners who provide quality service over a period of at least five years.\n\nThe Scouter's Training Award is a set of recognitions for leaders who complete tenure, training and performance requirements.\n\nThe Scouter's Key is a set of recognitions for primary unit leaders who complete advanced tenure, training and performance requirements.\n\nThe Unit Leader Award of Merit is for Cubmasters, Scoutmasters, Coaches and Advisors who meet requirements for tenure, personal training, unit quality and youth training.\n\n\nDistinguished service awards are presented at various levels to recognize noteworthy and extraordinary service to youth.\n\n\nRecognizes outstanding services by an adult individual or an organization for demonstrated involvement in the development and implementation of Scouting opportunities for youth from rural or low-income urban backgrounds.\nRecognizes outstanding services by an adult individual or an organization for demonstrated involvement in the development and implementation of Scouting opportunities for Hispanic American/Latino youth.\nRecognizes outstanding services by an adult individual or an organization for demonstrated involvement in the development and implementation of Scouting opportunities for Asian American youth.\n\n\nA National Service Award for full-time paraprofessional Scouters given every other year, named in honor of Dr. Frank \"Tick\" Coleman.

Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening. Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano's bright yellow colour. \n\nNeutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla. The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla. In the final stage, distilled water, refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base. The original blend is formulated at 84.6 proof (42.3% by volume), while a blend with a more prominent taste of vanilla is produced at 60 proof (30% by volume).\n\nGalliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes. The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as sambuca, Pernod, or anisette. It is used both as a digestivo (meant for drinking after heavy meals), and as an ingredient for cocktails, most notably the Harvey Wallbanger, Yellow Bird, Golden Cadillac, and Golden Dream.\n\nThe Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols, and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture, Maxxium. Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle, reminiscent of a classical Roman column. Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name, including a black Sambuca, a white Sambuca and an amaretto, which are predominantly distributed in Australasia, where the products are popular as shots.\nGalliano also makes \"Galliano Ristretto\" coffee-flavored liqueur and \"Galliano Balsamico\", a balsamic vinegar-infused liqueur. Both Galliano Autentico and Galliano Vanilla, as used in the Harvey Wallbanger, are available.\n\nGalliano has earned bronze and silver medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Another spirit ratings organization, Wine Enthusiast, gave Galliano L'autentico a score of \"90-95\" in 2011.\n"}
{"id": "228484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228484", "title": "Chaos magic", "text": "Chaos magic\n\nChaos magic, also spelled chaos magick, is a contemporary magical practice. It was initially developed in England in the 1970s, drawing heavily from the philosophy of artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare. Sometimes referred to as \"success magic\" or \"results-based magic\", chaos magic claims to emphasize the attainment of specific results over the symbolic, ritualistic, theological or otherwise ornamental aspects of other occult traditions.\n\nChaos magic has been described as a union of traditional occult techniques and applied postmodernism – particularly a postmodernist skepticism concerning the existence or knowability of objective truth. Chaos magicians subsequently treat belief as a tool, often creating their own idiosyncratic magical systems and frequently borrowing from other magical traditions, religious movements, popular culture and various strands of philosophy. \n\nEarly leading figures include Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin.\n\nChaos magic differs from other occult traditions such as Thelema or Wicca in that it rejects the existence of absolute truth, and views all occult systems as arbitrary symbol-systems that are only effective because of the \"belief\" of the practitioner. Chaos magic thus takes an explicitly agnostic position on whether or not magic exists as a supernatural force, with many chaos magicians expressing their acceptance of a psychological model as one possible explanation.\n\nIt is unknown when the term \"chaos magic\" first emerged, with the earliest texts on the subject referring only to \"magic\" or \"the magical art\" in general. Furthermore, they often claimed to state principles universal to magic, as opposed to a new specific style or tradition, describing their innovations as efforts to rid magic of superstitious and religious ideas.\nThe word \"chaos\" was first used in connection with magic by Peter J. Carroll in \"Liber Null & Psychonaut\" (1978), where it is described as \"the 'thing' responsible for the origin and continued action of events.\" Carroll goes on to say that \"It could as well be called 'God' or 'Tao', but the name 'Chaos' is virtually meaningless and free from the anthropomorphic ideas of religion.\"\n\nOther magical traditions like Wicca, Qabalah or the Golden Dawn system combine techniques for bringing about change with \"beliefs, attitudes, a conceptual model of the universe (if not several), a moral ethic, and a few other things besides.\" Chaos magic grew out of the desire to strip away all of these extraneous elements, leaving behind only the techniques for affecting change; hence the emphasis is on actually \"doing\" things – i.e., experimenting with different techniques, rather than memorising complex rules, symbols and correspondences – and then retaining those techniques that appear to produce results.\n\nThis \"pick'n'mix/D.I.Y\" approach means that the working practices of different chaos magicians often look drastically different, with many authors explicitly encouraging readers to invent their own magical style.\n\nThe central defining tenet of chaos magic is arguably the \"meta-belief\" that \"belief is a tool for achieving effects\". In chaos magic, complex symbol systems like Qabalah, the Enochian system, astrology or the I Ching are treated as maps or \"symbolic and linguistic constructs\" that can be manipulated to achieve certain ends but that have no absolute or objective truth value in themselves – a position referred to by religious scholar Hugh Urban as a \"rejection of all fixed models of reality\", and often summarised with the phrase \"nothing is true everything is permitted\".\n\nSome commentators have traced this position to the influence of postmodernism on contemporary occultism. Another influence comes from the magical system of Austin Osman Spare, who believed that belief itself was a form of \"psychic energy\" that became locked up in rigid belief structures, and that could be released by breaking down those structures. This \"free belief\" could then be directed towards new aims.\n\nOther writers have highlighted the influence of occultist Aleister Crowley, who wrote of the occult:\n\nIn this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.\n\nWithin the magical system of Austin Osman Spare, magic was thought to operate by using symbols to communicate \"desire\" to something Spare termed \"Kia\" (a sort of universal mind, of which individual human consciousnesses are aspects) via the \"passage\" of the unconscious – hence the need for complex systems of symbolism. Provided there was enough \"free belief\" to feed them, these desires would then grow, unconsciously, into \"obsessions\", which would culminate in magical results occurring in reality.\n\nPeter J. Carroll inherited this model from Spare, but used the term \"Kia\" to refer to the consciousness of the individual: \"the elusive 'I' which confers self-awareness\". The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed \"Chaos\". In his own words:\n\nChaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.\n\nLater chaos magicians have stressed that this basic operating process can be explained in multiple different ways, from within different paradigms. For example:\n\n\nSince chaos magic is built around an experimental, D.I.Y. approach that involves stripping all magical techniques down to their barest essence, any practice from any magical tradition can be incorporated under the banner of chaos magic: from Satanic ritual, to Wiccan sabbats, to energy healing, to Tantric practices, etc. However, there are a few techniques that have been specifically developed by chaos magicians, and are unique to the tradition.\n\nMost chaos magic techniques involve something called the gnostic state, or gnosis. This is described as an altered state of consciousness in which a person's mind is focused on only one point, thought, or goal and all other thoughts are thrust out. The gnostic state is used to bypass the \"filter\" of the conscious mind – something thought to be necessary for working most forms of magic.\n\nSince it takes years of training to master this sort of Zen-like meditative ability, chaos magicians employ a variety of other ways to attain a \"brief 'no-mind' state\" in which to work magic. Three main types of gnosis are described:\n\n\n\n\nA sigil is a picture or glyph that represents a particular desire or intention. They are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of monogram. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to \"launch\" or \"charge\" the sigil – essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious. To quote Ray Sherwin:\n\nThe magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.\n\nAfter charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: there should be \"a deliberate striving to forget it\", in Spare's words.\n\nIn the Medieval era, a \"sigil\" was a symbol associated with a particular angel or demon, which could be used to ritually summon the relevant being. Spare turned this practice on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply complexes in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilisation. In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a servitor. When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of \"group mind\", then it is referred to as an egregore.\n\nLater chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. Grant Morrison coined the term \"hypersigil\" to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His comic book series \"The Invisibles\" was intended as such a hypersigil. Morrison has also argued that modern corporate logos like \"the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph\" are a form of viral sigil:\n\nCorporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.\n\nGordon White developed the technique of \"shoaling\", which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for \"money\", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. – all of which help \"shift the probability\" towards the overall aim. White also developed the technique of the \"robofish\", which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to \"lead\" the rest of the shoal.\n\nThe cut-up technique is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged, often at random, to create a new text. The technique can also be applied to other media: film, photography, audio recordings, etc. It was pioneered by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs.\n\nBurroughs – who practiced chaos magic, and was inducted into the chaos magic organisation The Illuminates of Thanateros in the early 1990s – was adamant that the technique had a magical function, stating \"the cut ups are not for artistic purposes\". Burroughs used his cut-ups for \"political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration\" – the essential idea being that the cut-ups allowed the user to \"break down the barriers that surround consciousness\". As Burroughs himself stated:\n\nI would say that my most interesting experience with the earlier techniques was the realization that when you make cut-ups you do not get simply random juxtapositions of words, that they do mean something, and often that these meanings refer to some future event. I've made many cut-ups and then later recognized that the cut-up referred to something that I read later in a newspaper or a book, or something that happened... Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.\n\nDavid Bowie compared the randomness of the cut-up technique to the randomness inherent in traditional divinatory systems, like the I Ching or Tarot.\n\nOther chaos magicians have elaborated on the basic technique. Genesis P-Orridge, who studied under Burroughs, describes it as a way to \"identify and short circuit control, life being a stream of cut-ups on every level. They are a means to describe and reveal reality and the multi-faceted individual in which/from which reality is generated.\" Dave Lee suggested various magical ways to use the cut-up technique, such as cutting together two people to form a love spell.\n\nSynchromysticism, a portmanteau of synchronicity and mysticism, is \"the art of realising meaningful coincidences in the seemingly mundane with mystical or esoteric significance\". It has also been described as \"a form of postmodern animism\" that \"combines Jung's notion of meaningful coincidences with the quest for the divine, or self-actualization through experience of the divine.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, the founders of chaos magic were clear that the \"results\" to be attained through their techniques consisted of synchronicities, with Carroll stating in \"Liber Null & Psychonaut\":\n\nAll magical paradigms partake of some form of action at a distance, be it distance in space or time or both... In magic this is called synchronicity. A mental event, perception, or an act of will occurs at the same time (synchronously) as an event in the material world... Of course, this can always be excused as coincidence, but most magicians would be quite content with being able to arrange coincidences.\n\nEssentially, chaos magic consists of a set of techniques for \"deliberately engineering synchronicities\". As Carroll makes clear in later texts, magical \"results\" consist of \"meaningful coincidences\" or \"a series of events going somewhat improbably in the desired direction.\" Later chaos magicians have made the link between chaos magic and synchromysticism more overt. Gordon White, for example, writes in \"Synchromysticism as Kabbalah\": \n\nHow does the Technical Hermetica ‘work’? How did Ficino’s system of planetary ritual magic ‘work’? Simply put, both work because some things are associated with other things. Symbols recur, patterns repeat, sounds heard on a radio associate with similar outcomes in your life. An Animist universe speaks a language of symbol and synchronicity. To you, to itself, to the birds. This awareness underpins systems of magical correspondence the world over – such as practical Kabbalah or Technical Hermetica... These systems are indications that the universe speaks in a symbolic language... use them in a wider synchromystic context.\n\nElsewhere, White speculates that this may be \"the secret of kabbalistic apotheosis\" – \"hearing the language behind the words, connecting the things that aren't connected... a mystical framework for exploring and \"encouraging\" synchronicity.\"\n\nChaos magic was first developed in England in the mid-1970s, at a time when British occultism was dominated by Wicca and Thelema. Although both of these traditions incorporate magical elements, they are both religions, and as such contain devotional elements, liturgy and dogma. Chaos magic grew out of the desire of some occultists to strip away these extrinsic details and distill magic down to a set of tried-and-tested techniques for causing effects to occur in reality. An oft quoted line from Peter Carroll is \"Magic will not free itself from occultism until we have strangled the last astrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master.\"\n\nPeter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin are considered to be the founders of chaos magic, although Phil Hine points out that there were others \"lurking in the background, such as the \"Stoke Newington Sorcerors\"\" – a group which included Charles Brewster (Frater Choronzon). Carroll was a regular contributor to \"The New Equinox\", a magazine edited by Sherwin, and thus the two became acquainted.\n\n1978 was perhaps the seminal year in the origin of chaos magic, seeing the publication of both \"Liber Null\" by Carroll and \"The Book of Results\" by Sherwin – the first published books on chaos magic – and the establishment of The Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT), the first chaos magic organization.\n\nAustin Osman Spare is largely the source of chaos magical theory and practice. Specifically, Spare developed the use of sigils and the use of gnosis to empower these. Most basic sigil work recapitulates Spare's technique, including the construction of a phrase detailing the magical intent, the elimination of duplicate letters, and the artistic recombination of the remaining letters to form the sigil. Although Spare died before chaos magic emerged, many consider him to be the grandfather of chaos magic because of his repudiation of traditional magical systems in favor of a technique based on gnosis.\n\nAleister Crowley was a marginal yet early and ongoing influence, particularly for his syncretic approach to magic, and his emphasis on experimentation and deconditioning. Other early influences include Discordianism, the punk movement, postmodernism and the writings of Robert Anton Wilson. Lionel Snell was also publishing writing on Spare in the mid-1970s, and became drawn into the burgeoning chaoist movement. Snell's book \"SSOTBME\" (1974) also came to influence the early chaos magicians.\n\nHowever, despite these influences, it's clear from their early writings that the first chaos magicians were attempting to recover a sort of universal shamanism by stripping away any accumulated cultural gloss. Carroll makes this clear in \"Liber Null\":\n\nWhen stripped of local symbolism and terminology, all systems show a remarkable uniformity of method. This is because all systems ultimately derive from the tradition of Shamanism. It is toward an elucidation of this tradition that the following chapters are devoted.\n\nThis is echoed in Snell's description of Spare as a \"master shaman\" who brought into the world a new form of \"shamanistic sorcery\".\n\nNew chaos magic groups emerged in the early 1980s – at first, located in Yorkshire, where both Sherwin and Carroll were living. The early scene was focused on a shop in Leeds called \"The Sorceror's Apprentice\", owned by Chris Bray. Bray also published a magazine called \"The Lamp of Thoth\", which published articles on chaos magic, and his \"Sorceror's Apprentice Press\" re-released both \"Liber Null\" and \"The Book of Results\", as well as \"Psychonaut\" and \"The Theatre of Magic\". \"The Circle of Chaos\", which included Dave Lee, was formed in Yorkshire in 1982. The rituals of this group were published by Paula Pagani as \"The Cardinal Rites of Chaos\" in 1985.\n\nRalph Tegtmeier (Frater U.D.), who ran a bookshop in Germany and was already practicing his own brand of \"ice magick\", translated \"Liber Null\" into German. Tegtmeier was inducted into the IOT in the mid-1980s, and later established the German section of the order. He was excommunicated in 1990 over the \"Ice Magic Wars\". Lola Babalon established the first American IOT temple in 1988.\n\nAs chaos magic spread, people from outside Carroll and Sherwin's circle began publishing on the topic. Phil Hine, who practiced chaos magic alongside Tantra and Wicca, published a number of books on the subject that were particularly influential in spreading chaos magic techniques via the internet. Jaq D. Hawkins, from California, wrote an article on chaos magic for \"Mezlim\" magazine, coming into contact with Sherwin and other IOT members in the process. Hawkins later wrote the first chaos magic book intended for a general readership. In 1992, Jan Fries published \"Visual Magick\", introducing his own blend of \"freestyle shamanism\", which has had influence on chaos magic.\n\nIn 1981, Genesis P-Orridge established Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY), an art collective and magical order. P-Orridge had studied magic under William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in the 1970s, and was also influenced by Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare, as well as the psychedelic movement. TOPY practiced chaos magic alongside their other activities, and helped raise awareness of chaos magic in subcultures like the Acid House and Industrial music scenes. They were also partially responsible for introducing the techniques of Burroughs and Gysin to the chaos magic stream – but this influence also ran the other way, with Burroughs (who already practiced magic and was experimenting with Spare's sigil technique) being inducted into the IOT in the early 1990s.\n\nFrom the beginning, chaos magic has had a tendency to draw on the symbolism of pop culture in addition to that of \"authentic\" magical systems; the rationale being that all symbol systems are equally arbitrary, and thus equally valid – the belief invested in them being the thing that matters. The symbol of chaos, for example, was lifted from the fantasy novels of Michael Moorcock.\n\nPreluded by Kenneth Grant – who had studied with both Crowley and Spare, and who had introduced elements of H.P. Lovecraft's fictional Cthulhu mythos into his own magical writings – there was a trend for chaos magicians to perform rituals invoking or otherwise dealing with entities from Lovecraft's work, such as the Great Old Ones. Hine, for example, published \"The Pseudonomicon\" (1994), a book of Lovecraftian rites.\n\nIn turn, by the mid-1990s, chaos magic itself was beginning to leak into pop culture. Many of the writers and artists who produced strips for British sci-fi comic 2000ad also practiced chaos magic – among them Pat Mills, Bryan Talbot, Tony Skinner, and Dave Thorpe – and many included frequent references to chaos magic in their work. Mills, for example, created the characters of Nemesis the Warlock and Deadlock, both of whom practiced \"khaos magick\".\n\nGrant Morrison, who began practicing chaos magic at 19, wrote the series \"Zenith\" for 2000ad. \"Zenith\" frequently featured chaos magic themes, as well as a distinct Lovecraftian influence, and the Cthulhu mythos-inspired monsters of the story were copied straight from the illustrations of \"Liber Null\" – leading to the threat of a lawsuit from Peter Carroll.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, Morrison wrote \"The Invisibles\" for DC Comics' Vertigo imprint, which has been described by Morrison as a \"hypersigil\": \"a dynamic miniature model of the magician's universe, a hologram, microcosm or 'voodoo doll' which can be manipulated in real time to produce changes in the macrocosmic environment of 'real' life.\" Both \"The Invisibles\" and the activities of Morrison himself were responsible for bringing chaos magic to a much wider audience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the writer outlining his views on chaos magic in the \"Pop Magic!\" chapter of \"A Book of Lies\" (2003) a Disinfo Convention talk, and the documentary \"\". \n\nMorrison's particular take on chaos magic exemplified the irreverent, pop cultural elements of the tradition, with Morrison arguing that the deities of different religions (Hermes, Mercury, Thoth, Ganesh, etc.) are nothing more than different cultural \"glosses\" for more universal \"big ideas\" – and are therefore interchangeable: both with each other, and with other pop culture icons like The Flash, or Metron, or Madonna.\n\nOver the course of the past decade, chaos magic has experienced a shift away from the pop cultural interpretation that typified the Lovecraft/Morrison era. Jason Miller has argued that contemporary occultism has entered a \"post-chaos\" phase, in which chaos magicians are increasingly initiating into \"very old lineage traditions\", partially triggered by the realisation that \"imaginary gods and spirits or fictional characters \"do not\" seem to have the same effect as traditional ones\". Hine has spoken of his disillusionment with the idea that all magic \"can be formulated in terms of 'techniques' and that the theoretical underpinnings or cultural-historical context\" do not matter:\n\n...something you’ll sometimes see advocates of CM asserting is that singing rune charms and repeating Hindu mantras are essentially the same procedure – the focus being on the repetition of a word or phrase – in order to enter an altered state of consciousness. So mantras are something that gets chanted – and the chanting (i.e. the iteration) is what’s important – not the content or the context.\n\nThis, to me, is a kind of reductionism. It predicates a universal explanation – that the ‘technique’ of iterative speech is enacted in order to establish an altered state of consciousness in the practitioner – and subordinates all instances which apparently look as though that’s what’s going on – to it. So for an advocate of CM, there would be little practical difference between, say, chanting a rune poem, repeating the Gayatri mantra, or singing a sea shanty.\n\nAlan Chapman – whilst praising chaos magic for \"breathing new life\" into Western occultism, thereby saving it from \"being lost behind a wall of overly complex symbolism and antiquated morality\" – has also criticised chaos magic for its lack of \"initiatory knowledge\": i.e., \"teachings that cannot be learned from books, but must be transmitted orally, or demonstrated\", present in all traditional schools of magic. Chapman has gone on to develop his own system, using the techniques of chaos magic to achieve the aims of Thelema, such as attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, or the Crossing of the Abyss.\n\nGordon White, meanwhile, has developed a distinctive blend of chaos magic technique and animism:\n\nIf the western esoteric tradition can be said to have an underlying belief system it is a form of Animism; that the world or the universe is in some sense a living thing... However you conceive of their 'true' nature, magic requires full engagement with fetishes and sacred ground and window areas such as crossroads. It also works best when you grant agency to objects or entities beyond human consciousness, and particularly so with living systems... It is more useful for the magician to consider living systems not as some unaware little eddies in a universal consciousness field, but as 'outposts' of the spirit world.\n\n\n"}

Scottish chef Boyd Tunnock invented Tunnock's teacake in 1956 when he developed the idea of using Italian meringue, adding it to a biscuit base, and covering it in milk chocolate. In Denmark the treat was originally made using cream (hence the Danish name \"\" (cream buns)), but the filling was later made from egg whites to help industrialize production and improve shelf life. Many languages used to refer to these treats as phrases or compounds using a counterpart to negro (e.g. \"negro's kiss\", \"negro bun\"); most but not all of these are increasingly being avoided, especially in formal writing, in favour of less stigmatised substitutes such as \"choco-kiss\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom this confection is known as a chocolate teacake,\nthough it is entirely unlike the usual English teacake, a sweet roll with dried fruit which is served toasted and buttered. Teacakes are generally served in the afternoon alongside a traditional British 'cuppa'. There are several manufacturers of chocolate teacakes in the UK, though the best known is Tunnock's, a Scottish company founded in 1890. It was invented by Boyd Tunnock in 1956. He developed the idea of using Italian meringue. He made a biscuit base, hand piped the mallow onto the base and covered it in milk chocolate. The Tunnock's teacake is commonly regarded in the same food category as the British biscuit, eaten at break times with a cup of tea as shown in advertising for the product.\nPopular throughout the UK, the Tunnock's Teacake enjoys iconic status in Scotland, evoking memories of childhood, or symbolising \"home\" for Scots around the world. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service gives Tunnock's Teacakes to blood donors in Scotland after giving blood. There is an online appreciation society for the Tunnock's Teacake and Dundee University also has an appreciation society for the Tunnocks Teacake. A giant fully edible replica of a Tunnocks Teacake was made by Michelle Kershaw and Nick Dodds at \"Pimp That Snack\". The opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow featured giant dancing Tunnocks Teacakes.\n\nThe product itself consists of a small round shortbread base covered with a hemisphere of Italian meringue, a whipped egg white concoction similar to marshmallow. As this soft white fondant is based on egg white rather than gelatine, it is much more delicate than marshmallow. This is then coated in a thin layer of milk or plain chocolate and, in the case of Tunnock's, wrapped in a distinctive red and silver foil for the more popular milk chocolate variety, and a blue and gold wrapping for the plain chocolate type. Several competing brands to Tunnock's, such as Lees' Foods, also include jam in the centre of the teacake.\nIn 2013 British café chain Costa Coffee introduced the giant marshmallow teacake, which is around 3 times the size of a standard teacake, with a chocolate biscuit base topped with marshmallow and raspberry jam in the centre.\n\nAn argument about whether the teacake is a biscuit or a cake led to an action in the European Court of Justice by British company Marks and Spencer. The UK tax authorities had eventually accepted the company's argument that the teacakes were cakes (biscuits are taxed, cakes are not), but refused to repay most of the VAT. The European court ruled that in principle the tax should be repaid and in a further hearing before the UK Law Lords in 2009, after 13 years of litigation, Marks and Spencer won full repayment of the tax they had paid from 1973 to 1994, amounting to £3.5 million. This case was fought with Jaffa cakes.\n\nIn Turkey, there is no single term in common use. Literally, it can be called \"Konfeksiyon\". Sometimes it could be called by related brand names as in \"Çokomel\" or \"Eti Puf\"\n\nIn Denmark the confection is known as a \"flødebolle\" (cream bun) and was in some parts, mostly in the Copenhagen area, of Denmark formerly known as a \"negerbolle\" (negro bun) or \"negerkys\" (negro kiss). In the 1960s through 1980s the term negro was phased out by all major producers due to its use as a racial slur. Denmark also markets a variation shaped more like a patty, hence the name \"bøf\" (steak).\n\nDenmark is one of the largest producers of chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, producing approximately 800 million of these every year. The largest Danish producer, Elvirasminde, produces roughly 650 million treats, sending 400 million abroad and leaving the remaining 250 million to be eaten by the Danish population, putting the amount of \"flødeboller\" eaten at 45 per Dane per year.\n\nIn Denmark chocolate-coated marshmallow treats are traditionally handed out in school by children on their birthday. They are found in any supermarket, and most confectioners will have delicacy versions. It is also a Popular addition to Ice Cream Cones, offered at most shops selling Ice Cream. Usually they are placed on top of the last ball of Ice Cream with whipped cream and jam (Or \"Guf\", a topping made of whipped egg whites with sugar and fruit flavoring) Sometimes they are even found in restaurants. Many baking enthusiast see them as a challenge, and it was a technical challenge in \"Den store Bagedyst\" (The Great Bake Off) on Danish TV.\n\nThe popularity of the treat is evident from the sheer number of varieties. Variation in coating ranging from white chocolate over dark chocolate to licorice coating, with or without sprinkles. The base is often a plain wafer in commercial products, but delicacy and homemade versions often have shortbread, marzipan biscuits or other bases. Flavored filling is also very common especially when homemade, but licorice, marzipan and other flavors are commercially available. Variation in form is also common, often this is seen in commercial products ranging from wide and flat (bøf) to tall with sharp edges (Christmas tree).\n\nWithin the last 10 years, luxury versions have become more popular, and has also made the image of the 'flødebolle' change from a basic candy or Cake, to a luxury product suitable as a dessert or present, similar to a box of high-quality chocolates. The luxury versions have a much thicker layer of chocolate, and the chocolate is of a much higher quality, available in many variations and additional toppings (Everything from chunked nuts, to small pieces of very thin gold) . The bottom biscuit (That usually has a very neutral taste) is replaced with Marzipan. These types were usually homemade and only found in special chocolate stores and restaurants, but is now available in most supermarkets, since mass-produced versions have become a huge success.\n\nKrembo, or \"Creambo\" (, a contraction meaning literally \"Cream-in-it\"), is the name of a chocolate-coated marshmallow treat that is popular in Israel, especially in the winter as an alternative to ice-cream. \"Krembo whipped snack\" consists of a round biscuit base (17% of total weight), topped with fluffy marshmallow creme-like foam (53%), coated in a thin layer of compound chocolate (about 30%) and wrapped in colorful, thin aluminum foil. Over time, different flavorings have been attempted for the foam by the different manufacturers, but the most popular have always predominantly been the vanilla flavoring and, to a lesser extent, the mocha flavoring. According to a study funded by Strauss, Israel's leading krembo producer, 69% of Israelis prefer to eat krembos from the top down (starting with the cream), and only 10% start with the biscuit at the bottom; the rest had no preference.\n\nEuropean chocolate-coated marshmallow treats were popular as homemade sweets in Mandate Palestine, when it was known as Kushi (Hebrew כושי, \"\"Nubian\"\" or Black African ) and Rosh Kushi (Hebrew language: ראש כושי \"\"Nubian's head\"\") This name was borrowed from the names then used in Europe. It entered mass production in 1966. The first manufacturer, the Whitman Company, coined the name \"Krembo\". In Hebrew, the word \"krembo\" is a combination of \"krem\" (cream) and \"bo\" (in it). A mocha flavour was introduced in 1967. In 1979 Whitman was acquired by Strauss which has the major part of the krembo market in Israel. During the 1980s and 1990s smaller manufacturers introduced additional flavours such as banana and strawberry but failed to achieve a significant market share. Today Strauss controls 54% of the krembo market in Israel. In 2007, Nestlé introduced an ice cream variation of krembo called \"Lekbo\" (Hebrew: לקבו, \"\"lick inside\"\").\n\nKrembos are a seasonal treat sold only four months a year, from October to February. Nevertheless, 50 million krembos are sold each year—an average of 9 per person. Krembos are exported to the United States and Canada, and sold mostly in kosher shops and import stores.\n\nIn 2005, Strauss signed an agreement with Unilever to export ice cream and krembos to the United States and Canada due to a demand for products of this type with strict Kosher certification. Under terms of the agreement, they may be sold only in kosher supermarkets and import shops. The distributor in North America is Dairy Delight, a subsidiary of Norman's Dairy. In 2007, Nestlé introduced an ice cream variation of krembo called \"Lekbo\" (Hebrew: לקבו, \"\"lick inside\"\").\n\nThe average krembo weighs 25 grams (0.92 ounces) and has 115 calories. According to the fine print on packing foil, per 100 g of krembo there are 419 calories, 3.2 g protein, 64 g carbohydrates (of which 54 g are sugars); 16.7% Fats (of which 13.9% are poly-saturated fatty acids, less than 0.5% are trans fatty acids) and 67 mg sodium.\n\nUnder kashrut, the dietary rules of Jewish law or (Halacha), some orthodox rabbis find significance to the order in which one eats a Krembo. The blessing over the biscuit is \"boreh miney mezonot\", whereas the blessing over the cream and chocolate is \"shehakol nihiyya bidvaro\". According to halacha, when eating a dish of mixed components, one need pronounce only the blessing over the main components, thus for a chocolate croissant one would say the blessing over the dough, and skip the blessing over the chocolate. But in the case of the Krembo, there is no consensus as to which is the \"main\" component: the biscuit, or the cream and chocolate. One solution is to bless over each component separately.\n\nThe Krembo has become a pop-cultural/national icon. Although considered a children's treat, sociologists have found that it is consumed as a comfort food by Israeli expatriates in the United States, evoking nostalgia for their childhood.\n\nIsraeli rock band Kaveret's hit song \"Shir HaMakolet\" (\"The Grocery Store Song\") mentions a character buying Krembo.\n\nIn the Hebrew version of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", as translated by Gili Bar-Hillel, Dumbledore's favourite sweet is a Krembo, rather than a sherbet lemon.\n\nAlon 'Krembo' Sagiv is a fictional character in the Israeli cult film \"Mivtza Savta\" (Operation Granny), as a child on a kibbutz he once stole an entire case of Krembos and locked himself in his room. With the entire kibbutz waiting for him outside he had to dispose of the evidence and ate the entire case (500 krembos!), earning himself his much-loathed nickname.\n\nIn the United States, Mallomars are produced by Nabisco. A graham cracker circle is overlain with extruded marshmallow, then coated in a thin shell of dark chocolate. Mallomars were introduced to the public in 1913, the same year as the Moon Pie (a confection which has similar ingredients). The first box of Mallomars was sold in West Hoboken, New Jersey (now Union City, New Jersey).\n\nMallomars are generally available from early October through to April. They are not distributed during the summer months, supposedly because they melt easily in summer temperatures, though this is as much for marketing reasons as for practical ones. Devoted eaters of the cookie have been known to stock up during winter months and keep them refrigerated over the summer, although Nabisco markets other chocolate-coated cookie brands year-round. Eighty-five percent of all Mallomars are sold in the New York metropolitan area. They are produced entirely within Canada, at a factory in Scarborough, Ontario.\n\nIn Germany were first commercially made 1920, although the first mention of them in dates back to 1829. Industrial manufacturing started in the 1950s. The sweets are made all year long, approximately one billion are made per year, placing average consumption at about one dozen per person per year. They are available in supermarkets, many bakeries and traditionally sold at fairs.\n\nSometimes they are consumed pressed between two halves of a bun, which is also referred to as a \"Matschbrötchen\" (\"Mud Roll\", \"Squished Bread Roll\")—mostly by children. The interior is always egg white foam, sweetened with sugar, but there are also varieties using sugar substitutes available on the German market.\n\nThe original colloquial names were \"Mohrenkopf\" (\"Moor's Head\") or \"Negerkuss\" (\"Negro's Kiss\"), but most companies changed the product-name to a more neutral \"Schokoküsse\" or \"Schokokuss\" (\"Chocolate Kiss\"), \"Schaumküsse\" or \"Schaumkuss\" (\"Foam Kiss\") or to brand-specific names.\n\nIn German-speaking Switzerland they are still sold as \"Mohrenkopf\". In the French-speaking part of Switzerland as well as France they are known as \"Têtes Choco\" (\"chocolate heads\"), or and more commonly as \"Tête-de-nègre\" in France.\n\nIn Finland, the name originated from Germany, and they were named \"Negro Kisses\" in 1951. In 2001 the name was changed to \"Brunberg's Kisses\", after the manufacturer, for largely the same reasons as in Denmark, Germany, and elsewhere.\n\nIn Flanders, the confection is known as \"negerinnentetten\". The word can either be translated as \"negress's tits\" or could originate from the French word for head: \"tête\", as the French word for this confection used to be \"tête de nègre\", which is French for \"negro's head\". This is also the probable origin of an alternative name \"negertetten\". Nowadays manufacturers market the confection under a different name, as the aforementioned terms are considered to be offensive.\n\nIn Belgium, Milka branded it under the name \"Melo-Cakes\". These popular treats are sold in packages of 6 pieces, and up to 30 pieces (family pack).\n\nIn the Netherlands the name is \"Negerzoenen\" (\"Negro kisses\") though some companies have changed the name to \"Zoenen\" (\"Kisses\"). This led to some controversy, since the Dutch word \"neger\" was generally perceived as more neutral compared to the English equivalent \"negro\", which is considered pejorative and racist. Those often package nine per box to create the pun \"Negen Zoenen\" (\"Nine Kisses\"). One such company, Buys, has said that the name change was made for marketing reasons.\n\nWhippet cookies are produced in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They consist of a biscuit base topped with marshmallow-like filling and then coated in a hard shell of pure chocolate.\nWhippet cookies first came to the market in 1927, although they had been produced and distributed by Viau under the name \"Empire\" as early as 1901. Today, the cookies are still produced in Montreal at the east end of the Viau factory, which is now owned by Dare Foods. They are currently available with both dark chocolate and milk chocolate coatings, and with several flavors of artificial fruit jam filling inside the marshmallow-like filling.\n\nThe cookies are similar to Mallomars of New York City. They also bear a striking resemblance to Tunnock's Tea Cakes as well as Krembos. However, the Tunnock tea cake does not have the same kind of chocolate and a different type of filling.\n\nThe Whippet cookie is a distinct part of Quebec culture because it does not travel well outside its area of production. This is partly because the pure chocolate melts very easily (compared with a chocolate mixture) and therefore they require refrigerated transport in summer. Furthermore, the combination of the hard chocolate shell and the air-filled inner marshmallow make them self-destruct when placed in the unpressurised or semi-pressurised cargo section of an airplane. However, they are currently available at various grocery locations throughout Canada and the US.\n\nThough usually known by their proper trade name 'Whippets', these biscuits are also popularly referred to in the Montreal area as 'Nun's Farts' in the Anglophone community. Though they bear absolutely no resemblance to the Quebec pastry confections called pets de soeurs, it has been suggested that the combination of dark chocolate coating and white marshmallow filling is evocative of the black and white habits of certain orders of Quebec nuns. This, in conjunction with their light and airy texture, may have given rise to the cheeky Anglo-Quebecois moniker. It is not used by the francophone community.\n\nAn episode of the Canadian science program \"How It's Made\" showed the production process behind the cookie. However, many aspects of the production process (the amount of marshmallow filling, the ingredients, etc.) were not revealed. The show's narrator described these aspects as \"classified information\". As Canadian law requires an ingredient list on each package, the amount of confidential information involved is limited.\n\nAnother Canadian cookie, \"Viva Puffs\", is produced by Dare Foods in five flavours. Viva is a trade name; these confections have been known in (English) Canada for at least 50 years as \"chocolate puffs\".\n\nIn the Philippines, Fibisco makes a product similar to Mallomars called Choco Mallows that, unlike Mallomars, is available year-round. Likely due to the tropical climate, the \"hard chocolate shell\" of a Choco Mallow is usually just a soft chocolate covering that does not completely harden even after being refrigerated.\n\nIn Bolivia, Chocolates Condor is the traditional manufacturer of \"Beso de Negro\" (Negro Kiss). The confection is similar to the German Schokoküsse in its use of a sweetened egg white foam filling rather than a marshmallow-based filling. There have been attempts to introduce variations in flavor, but the \"classic\" version remains the most popular.\n\nIn Peru, the confections are known as \"Beso de Moza\" (Girl's Kiss)(), sold by Nestlé. Currently there is a contest between strawberry and lucuma flavors to become permanent versions of the product.\n\nIn Colombia and Ecuador, it's called \"Beso de Negra\" (Black Woman's Kiss) or \"\"Chocmelo\"\", a portmanteau of chocolate and \"masmelo\" (marshmallow). However, these last ones don't always have a cookie as its base.\n\nIn Portugal, these confections are known as \"Bombocas\". Sold by different brands, usually the supermarket ones. They are sold in 3 main flavors: meringue (white interior), strawberry (pink) and vanilla (yellow). They are being called \"Beijinhos\" in the last few years.\n\nIn New Zealand biscuit manufacturers Griffin's make MallowPuffs, a chocolate biscuit that is described as a \"light fluffy marshmallow sitting on top of a shortcake biscuit, covered in luxurious milk chocolate\". The marshmallow in MallowPuffs tends to be more dense and rubbery than in some similar products (such as Tunnock's chocolate teacakes). They come in a variety of flavours, including Cookies and Cream, Hokey Pokey, Toffee, Rocky Road, Double Chocolate and original chocolate. The slogan from a national advertising campaign for MallowPuffs, \"Have you done enough for a MallowPuff\", has entered into the New Zealand cultural lexicon.\n\nProduced in Serbia by Jaffa, it has a cookie base and a soft sponge filling covered by a cocoa mix.\n\nIn Brazil the dessert is known as Nhá Benta and is manufactured by the Kopenhagen chocolaterie, but other variants exists in Brazil such as Cacau Show's Montebello(doesn't contain the waffle base) and the one that popularised the international formula for the masses in Brazil, the Dan-Top. The cookies are sold in a variety of flavours, including coconut, lemon, passion fruit, caramel, boysenberry, tonka bean and coffee. It is also known as \"teta-de-nega\" (\"black woman's tit\"), but the name is becoming less used because its roots on racial prejudice and segregation. \n\nRicardito\n\nIn Uruguay is known as \"Ricardito\", merengue covered in chocolate manufactured by Ricard http://www.plucky.com.uy/sitio/productos/ricardito.php\n\nZefir (, may also be spelled \"zephyr\" or \"zephir\") is made from fruit and berry purée with added sugar and whipped egg whites. It is commonly produced and sold in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The recipe is a merger of the traditional Russian pastila with French meringue. The name given after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes its delicate airy consistency.\n\nThe consistency is similar to that of marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. The form typically resembles traditional meringue. However, in contrast to commercial meringue, it is never crisp. Both pure and chocolate-coated versions are widespread. In contrast to the other confectioneries of this type, it has no biscuit base.\n\nIn Lebanon, a local variation went on sale in the 1950s under the name \"ras el abd\" (slave's head) by Gandour; however, it has since been changed to \"Tarboush\" or \"Tarboosh\" (Fez) but continues to be referred to by the former name in public.\n\nArnott's Chocolate Royals are a chocolate coated-marshmallow treat of Australia, which are available in milk and dark chocolate varieties, and are similar in appearance to a Tunnock's teacake. In South Africa, a similar confection is Sweetie Pies, originally made by Cadbury's but now by Beyers.\n\nIn New Zealand, a common chocolate-coated marshmallow treat is the chocolate fish. A fish-shaped delicacy, 12 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) in length, it is made of pink or white marshmallow covered in a thin layer of milk chocolate. The milk chocolate's texture features scale-like ripples on the fish, created by the fish moving under a blower during production.\n\nIn Kiwi culture, the chocolate fish is a common immediate reward or prize for a small job done well (e.g. \"Give that kid a chocolate fish\") so much so that a phrase suggesting a person be awarded one can be said regardless of availability of the treat (and either as a compliment or sarcastically).\n\nChocolate marshmallow pies differ from regular chocolate-coated marshmallow treats in that there is a cake- or cookie-like layer above as well as below the marshmallow filling – that is, the marshmallow filling is sandwiched between two layers of cake or cookie, the entirety then being enrobed in chocolate. Some local names for chocolate marshmallow pies are:\n\n\n\n"}

A sweet variety usually contains stewed fruit topped with a crumbly mixture of fat (usually butter), flour, and sugar. A savoury version uses meat, vegetables and sauce for the filling, with cheese replacing sugar in the crumble mix. The crumble is baked in an oven until the topping is crisp. The dessert variety is often served with ice cream, cream, or custard. The savoury variety can be served with vegetables.\nPopular fruits used in crumbles include apple, blackberry, peach, rhubarb, gooseberry, and plum. A combination of two or more of these fruits may be used. The topping may also include rolled oats, ground almonds or other nuts, and sometimes sour milk (e.g. vinegar and milk) is added to give the crumble a more extravagant taste. Brown sugar is often sprinkled over the crumble topping, which caramelises slightly when baked. In some recipes the topping is made from broken biscuits (cookies in ) or even breakfast cereals, but this is not traditional.\n\nCrumbles became popular in Ireland during World War II, when the crumble topping was an economical alternative to pies due to shortages of pastry ingredients as the result of rationing. To further reduce the use of rationed flour, fat and sugar, breadcrumbs or oatmeal could be added to the crumble mix. The dish was also popular due to its simplicity.\n\nIn some parts of America the dish may be called a \"crisp\".\n\n"}
{"id": "230149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230149", "title": "Foie gras", "text": "Foie gras\n\nFoie gras (, ; ) is considered a luxury food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been especially fattened. By French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by force-feeding corn with a feeding tube, a process also known as gavage. In Spain and other countries, it is occasionally produced using natural feeding. Ducks are force-fed twice a day for 12.5 days and geese three times a day for around 17 days. Ducks are typically slaughtered at 100 days and geese at 112 days.\n\nFoie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait, or pâté, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states that \"Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France.\"\n\nThe technique of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.\n\nGavage-based foie gras production is controversial, due mainly to the animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding, and the production, import or sale of foie gras; even where it is legal, a number of retailers decline to stock it.\n\nAs early as 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced overfeeding and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in the tomb of Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks in order to push food down their throats. At the side stand tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for moistening the feed before giving it to the geese.\n\nThe practice of goose fattening spread from Egypt to the Mediterranean. The earliest reference to fattened geese is from the 5th century BC Greek poet Cratinus, who wrote of geese-fatteners, yet Egypt maintained its reputation as the source for fattened geese. When the Spartan king Agesilaus visited Egypt in 361 BC, he noted Egyptian farmers fattened geese and calves.\n\nIt was not until the Roman period, however, that foie gras is mentioned as a distinct food, which the Romans named \"iecur ficatum\"; \"iecur\" means liver and \"ficatum\" derives from \"ficus\", meaning fig in Latin. The emperor Elagabalus fed his dogs on foie gras during the four years of his reign. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) credits his contemporary, Roman gastronome Marcus Gavius Apicius, with feeding dried figs to geese in order to enlarge their livers:\n\nHence, the term \"iecur ficatum\", fig-stuffed liver; feeding figs to enlarge a goose's liver may derive from Hellenistic Alexandria, since much of Roman luxury cuisine was of Greek inspiration. \"Ficatum\" was closely associated with animal liver and it became the root word for \"liver\" in each of these languages: \"foie\" in French, \"hígado\" in Spanish, \"fígado\" in Portuguese, \"fegato\" in Italian, \"fetge\" in Catalan and Occitan and \"ficat\" in Romanian, all meaning \"liver\"; this etymology has been explained in different manners.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman empire, goose liver temporarily vanished from European cuisine. Some claim that Gallic farmers preserved the foie gras tradition until the rest of Europe rediscovered it centuries later, but the medieval French peasant's food animals were mainly pig and sheep. Others claim that the tradition was preserved by the Jews, who learned the method of enlarging a goose's liver during the Roman colonisation of Judea or earlier from Egyptians. The Jews carried this culinary knowledge as they migrated farther north and west to Europe.\n\nThe Judaic dietary law, Kashrut, forbade lard as a cooking medium, and butter, too, was proscribed as an alternative since Kashrut also prohibited mixing meat and dairy products. Jewish cuisine used olive oil in the Mediterranean, and sesame oil in Babylonia, but neither cooking medium was readily available in Western and Central Europe, so poultry fat (known in Yiddish as \"schmaltz\"), which could be abundantly produced by overfeeding geese, was substituted in their stead. The delicate taste of the goose's liver was soon appreciated; Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof of Kassel wrote in 1562 that the Jews raise fat geese and particularly love their livers. Some Rabbis were concerned that eating forcibly overfed geese violated Jewish food restrictions. Some rabbis contended that it is not a forbidden food (treyf) as none of its limbs are damaged and the geese did not feel any pain in their throats from the process. This matter remained a debated topic in Jewish dietary law until the Jewish taste for goose liver declined in the 19th century. Another kashrut matter, still a problem today, is that even properly slaughtered and inspected meat must be drained of blood before being considered fit to eat. Usually, salting achieves that; however, as liver is regarded as \"(almost) wholly blood\", broiling is the only way of kashering. Properly broiling a foie gras while preserving its delicate taste is difficult, and therefore rarely practiced. Even so, there are restaurants in Israel that offer grilled goose foie gras. Foie Gras also bears resemblance to the Jewish food staple, chopped liver.\nAppreciation of fattened goose liver spread to gastronomes outside the Jewish community, who could buy in the local Jewish ghetto of their cities. In 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, chef de cuisine to Pope Pius V, published his cookbook \"Opera\", wherein he describes that \"the liver of [a] domestic goose raised by the Jews is of extreme size and weighs [between] two and three pounds.\" In 1581, Marx Rumpolt of Mainz, chef to several German nobles, published the massive cookbook \"Ein Neu Kochbuch\", describing that the Jews of Bohemia produced livers weighing more than three pounds; he lists recipes for it—including one for goose liver mousse. János Keszei, chef to the court of Michael Apafi, the prince of Transylvania, included foie gras recipes in his 1680 cookbook \"A New Book About Cooking\", instructing cooks to \"envelop the goose liver in a calf's thin skin, bake it and prepare [a] green or [a] brown sauce to accompany it. I used goose liver fattened by Bohemian Jews, its weight was more than three pounds. You may also prepare a mush of it.\"\n\nIn the 21st century, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed in several other countries worldwide, particularly in some other European nations, the United States, and China. Approximately 30,000 people are members of the French foie gras industry, with 90% of them residing in the Périgord (Dordogne), the Aquitaine régions in the southwest, and Alsace région in the east. The European Union recognizes the foie gras produced according to traditional farming methods (\"label rouge\") in southwestern France with a geographical indication of provenance.\n\nHungary is the world's second-largest foie gras (\"libamáj\") producer and the largest exporter. France is the principal market for Hungarian foie gras – mainly exported raw. Approximately 30,000 Hungarian goose farmers are dependent on the foie gras industry. French food companies spice, process, and cook the foie gras so it may be sold as a French product in its domestic and export markets.\n\nSome countries have produced foie gras only sporadically in the past. For example, in 1996, Turkey had a peak year of production with 20 tonnes of foie gras valued at US$39,000 being exported.\n\nIn 2005, France produced 18,450 tonnes of foie gras (78.5% of the world's estimated total production of 23,500 tonnes) of which 96% was duck liver and 4% goose liver. Total French consumption of foie gras in this year was 19,000 tonnes. In 2005, Hungary, the world's second-largest foie gras producer exported 1,920 tonnes and Bulgaria produced 1,500 tons of foie gras.\n\nThe demand for foie gras in the Far East is such that China has become a sizeable producer. Madagascar is a small but rapidly growing producer of high quality foie gras.\nIn 2011 in Bulgaria (which started production in 1960), 5 million mule ducks were raised for foie gras on 800 farms. This figure makes Bulgaria the second largest producer in Europe.\n\nIn 2012, France produced around 19,000 tonnes of foie gras representing 75% of the world's production in that year. This required the force-feeding of around 38 million ducks and geese. World production in 2015 is estimated as 27,000 tonnes.\n\nIn 2014, the whole of the EU produced approximately 25,000 tonnes of foie gras – 23,000 tonnes of duck foie gras and 2,000 tonnes of goose foie gras. The same year, France was producing 72% of world foie gras production of which 97% was from ducks.\nIn 2015, it was reported that in France, sales of foie gras may be waning and an OpinionWay poll found that 47% of the French population supported a ban on force-feeding.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that France produces an estimated 75% of the world's foie gras and southwestern France produces approximately 70% of that total. In 2016, it can retail for upwards of $65 a pound.\n\nIn late 2015, there were several outbreaks of the highly contagious H5N1 bird flu in France, which escalated during 2016. This led to Algeria, China, Egypt, Japan, Morocco, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia banning French poultry exports, including foie gras, and France to initiate increased bio-security protocols which will cost an estimated 220 million euros. One of these measures was the halting of production in southwestern France from early April, 2016 for an anticipated period of three months to reduce the spread of the virus. Exports of foie gras from France are expected to decrease from 4,560 tonnes in 2015 to 3,160 tonnes in 2016.\n\nIn the United States, the largest producer is Hudson Valley Foie Gras, which uses approximately 350,000 ducks each year.\n\nIn France, foie gras exists in different, legally defined presentations, ordered by expense:\n\n\nAdditionally, there is \"pâté de foie gras\", \"mousse de foie gras\" (either must contain 50% or more foie gras), \"parfait de foie gras\" (must contain 75% or more foie gras); and other preparations (no legal obligation established).\n\nFully cooked preparations are generally sold in either glass containers or metal cans for long-term preservation. Whole, fresh foie gras is usually unavailable in France outside the Christmas period, except in some producers' markets in the producing regions. Frozen whole foie gras sometimes is sold in French supermarkets.\n\nWhole foie gras is readily available from gourmet retailers in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Argentina and regions with a sizeable market for the product. In US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest in fat and especially suited for low-temperature preparation, because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation, because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared. Grade C livers are generally reserved for making sauces as well as other preparations where a higher proportion of blood-filled veins will not impair the appearance of the dish.\n\nTraditionally, foie gras was produced from special breeds of geese. However, by 2004, geese accounted for less than 10% of the total global foie gras production and by 2014 only 5% of total French production. Goose breeds used in modern foie gras production are primarily the grey Landes goose (\"Anser anser\") and the Toulouse goose.\n\nIn 2016, Hungary was producing 80% of the world's goose foie gras, however, production rates are likely to drop in 2017 due to outbreaks of bird flu.\n\nIn 2014, ducks accounted for 95% of foie gras production. The breeds primarily used are the Muscovy duck (\"Cairina moschata\") (also called the Barbary duck) and the hybrid cross of a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck (\"Anas platyrhynchos domestica\") called the Mulard duck. This hybrid is sterile and is therefore sometimes referred to as a \"mule\" duck. Mulards are estimated to account for about 35% of all foie gras consumed in the US. About 95% of duck foie gras production from France comes from force fed Mulards and the remaining 5% from the Muscovy duck.\nAfter hatching, the Mulard ducklings are sexed. Males put on more weight than females, so the females are slaughtered, sometimes in an industrial macerator. Up to 40 million female ducks may be killed in this way. The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food, fertilisers and in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe ideology behind foie gras production is the ability that some waterfowl have to expand their esophagus and to gain weight, particularly in the liver, in preparation for migration. Unlike many birds, geese and ducks lack a crop. In the wild, esophageal dilation allows them to swallow large foodstuffs, such as a whole fish, for later digestion. Wild geese may consume 300 grams of protein and another 800 grams of grasses per day. Farmed geese allowed to graze on carrots adapt to eating 100 grams of protein, but may consume up to 2500 grams of the carrots per day. The increasing amount of feed given prior to force-feeding and during the force-feeding itself cause expansion of the lower part of the esophagus.\n\nThe pre-force feeding phase consists of three stages.\n\nThe next production phase, which the French call \"gavage\" or \"finition d'engraissement\", or \"completion of fattening\", involves forced daily ingestion of controlled amounts of feed for 12 to 15 days with ducks and for 15 to 18 days with geese. During this phase, ducks are usually fed twice daily while geese are fed up to three times daily. To facilitate handling of ducks during gavage, these birds are typically housed throughout this phase in individual cages or small group pens.\n\nTypical foie gras production involves force-feeding birds more food than they would eat in the wild, and much more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.\nIn modern production, the bird is typically fed a controlled amount of feed, depending on the stage of the fattening process, the bird's weight, and the amount of feed the bird last ingested. At the start of production, a bird might be fed a dry weight of of food per day and up to (in dry weight) by the end of the process. The actual amount of food force-fed is much greater, because the birds are fed a mash with a composition of about 53% dry and 47% liquid (by weight).\n\nThe feed is administered using a funnel fitted with a long tube (20–30 cm long), which forces the feed into the bird's esophagus. If an auger is used, the feeding takes about 45 to 60 seconds, however, modern systems usually use a tube fed by a pneumatic pump with an operation time of 2 to 3 seconds per duck. During feeding, efforts are made to avoid damaging the bird's esophagus, which could cause injury or death, although researchers have found evidence of inflammation of the walls of the proventriculus after the first session of force-feeding. There is also indication of inflammation of the esophagus in the later stages of fattening. Several studies have also demonstrated that mortality rates can be significantly elevated during the gavage period.\n\nThe feed, usually corn boiled with fat (to facilitate ingestion), deposits large amounts of fat in the liver, thereby producing the buttery consistency sought by some gastronomes.\n\nDucks reared for foie gras are typically slaughtered at 100 days of age and geese at 112 days. At this time, the bird's liver is 6 to 10 times its ordinary size. Storage of fat in the liver produces steatosis of the liver cells.\n\nFattened liver can be produced by alternative methods without gavage, and this is often referred to either as \"fatty goose liver\" or as foie gras (outside France), though it does not conform to the French legal definition. This method involves timing the slaughter to coincide with the winter migration, when livers are naturally fattened.\nThe winner of the Coup de Coeur award at the Salon International d'Alimentation, SIAL 2006, Patería de Sousa produces fattened livers without force-feeding. This has only recently been produced commercially, and is a very small fraction of the market.\n\nProducers outside France do not always force-feed birds to produce fattened livers considered to be foie gras, instead allowing them to eat freely, termed \"ad libitum\". Interest in alternative production methods has grown recently due to ethical concerns in gavage-based foie gras production. Such livers are alternatively termed fatty goose liver, ethical foie gras, or humane foie gras. The British supermarket chain Waitrose also provides a version of ethical foie gras which it calls (and has been trademarked) \"faux gras\". This is not to be confused with the American product by the same name, produced by Regal Vegan, which has the U.S. trademark for \"faux gras\", and is actually a vegan, nut-based spread.\n\nThe term \"ethical foie gras\" or \"humane foie gras\" is also used for gavage-based foie gras production that is more concerned with the animal's welfare (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment, as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.\n\nMore radical approaches have been studied. A duck or goose with a ventromedian hypothalamic (VMH) lesion will tend not to feel satiated after eating, and will therefore eat more than a non-lesioned animal. By producing such lesions surgically, it is possible to increase the bird's food consumption when permitted to eat \"ad libitum\", by a factor of more than two.\n\nGenerally, French preparations of foie gras are made over low heat, as fat melts faster from the traditional goose foie gras than the duck foie gras produced in most other parts of the world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck foie gras, have more recipes and dish preparations for serving foie gras hot, rather than cool or cold.\n\nIn Hungary, goose foie gras traditionally is fried in goose fat, which is then poured over the foie gras and left to cool; it is also eaten warm, after being fried or roasted, with some chefs smoking the foie gras over a cherry wood fire.\n\nIn other parts of the world foie gras is served in dishes such as foie gras sushi rolls, in various forms of pasta or alongside steak tartare or atop a steak as a garnish.\n\nTraditional low-heat cooking methods result in terrines, \"pâtés\", parfaits, foams and mousses of foie gras, often flavored with truffle, mushrooms or brandy such as cognac or armagnac. These slow-cooked forms of \"foie gras\" are cooled and served at or below room temperature.\n\nIn a very traditional form of terrine, \"au torchon\" (\"in a towel\"), a whole lobe of foie is molded, wrapped in a towel and slow-cooked in a \"bain-marie\". For added flavor (from the Maillard reaction), the liver may be seared briefly over a fire of grape vine clippings (\"sarments\") before slow-cooking in a bain-marie; afterwards, it is pressed served cold, in slices.\n\nRaw foie gras is also cured in salt (\"\"cru au sel\"\"), served slightly chilled.\n\nA pastry containing fatty goose liver and other ingredients is known as the \"Strasburg pie\" since Strasbourg was a major producer of foie gras. The pie is mentioned in William Makepeace Thackeray's novel \"Vanity Fair\" as being popular with the diplomatic corps.\n\nGiven the increased internationalization of cuisines and food supply, \"foie gras\" is increasingly found in hot preparations not only in the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras (\"\"foie gras de canard\"\") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is goose foie gras (\"\"foie gras d'oie\"\"), but chefs have been able to cook goose \"foie gras\" employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.\n\nRaw foie gras can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (\"poêlé\") or (with care and attention), grilled. As foie gras has high fat content, contact with heat needs to be brief and therefore at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25 mm (½ – 1 inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve the integrity of the fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the \"foie gras\" on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of molecular gastronomy such as Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in liquid nitrogen as part of the preparation process.\n\nHot foie gras requires minimal spices; typically black pepper, paprika (in Hungary) and salt. Chefs have used fleur de sel as a gourmet seasoning for hot foie gras to add an \"important textural accent\" with its crunch.\n\nFoie gras is a regarded as a gourmet luxury dish. In France, it is mainly consumed on special occasions, such as Christmas or New Year's Eve \"réveillon\" dinners, though the recent increased availability of foie gras has made it a less exceptional dish. In some areas of France \"foie gras\" is eaten year-round.\n\nDuck foie gras is the slightly cheaper and, since a change of production methods in the 1950s to battery, by far the most common kind, particularly in the US. The taste of duck foie gras is often referred to as musky with a subtle bitterness. Goose foie gras is noted for being less gamey and smoother, with a more delicate flavor.\n\nGavage-based foie gras production is controversial due to the animal welfare consequences of the force-feeding procedure, intensive housing and husbandry, an enlarged liver and the potential for being detrimental to human health. Some countries find foie gras to be \"morally objectionable\". One EU committee report noted that up to 1998, there was only a small number of scientific studies on the welfare of birds used for foie gras production, however, the Committee found sufficient evidence to conclude that \"force-feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds.\" The industry repeatedly faces accusations of torture and cruelty.\n\nThe production of foie gras occurs on the argument that migrating wildfowl seasonally eat such that their liver naturally enlarges. However, the bird used predominantly in foie gras production is a hybrid of a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck. It has been noted that the Muscovy duck is non-migratory, and both the Pekin and the mulard hybrid cannot fly. Domestic ducks (including the Pekin) are derived from the mallard duck, which is sometimes migratory and sometimes not. Therefore, although the domestic goose might well be adapted to store food before migration, it is less likely that the Mulard hybrid duck has the same potential.\n\nGeese and ducks show avoidance behaviour (indicating aversion) of the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure. Although an EU committee in 1998 reported seeing this aversion, they noted that at the time, there was no \"conclusive\" scientific evidence on the aversive nature of force-feeding. The AVMA (Animal Welfare Division) when considering foie gras production stated \"The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems to be more prone than its parent breeds to fear of people\".\n\nAn EU committee in 1998 reported that there was usually clear evidence of tissue damage in the esophagus of birds which had been gavage fed, although one 1972 study cited by the report observed no alteration of the esophageal tissue. More recent scientific studies have shown that the esophagus of birds can be injured or inflamed by gavage feeding.\n\nAfter measuring a range of physiological parameters in male Mulard ducks, it was concluded in one study that the acute stress caused by force feeding is similar at the beginning and end of the commercial production of foie gras. A similar study on Muscovy ducks found that gavage feeding was related to an increase in panting behaviour and serum corticosterone levels, indicating increased stress attributable to this feeding method.\n\nIn France, at the end of 2015, individual cages were prohibited to improve animal welfare. They will be replaced by cages which house 4 to 5 birds.\n\nDuring the force-feeding period, the birds are kept in individual cages, with wire or plastic mesh floors, or sometimes in small groups on slatted floors. Individual caging restricts movements and behaviours by preventing the birds from standing erect, turning around, or flapping their wings. Birds cannot carry out other natural waterfowl behaviours, such as bathing and swimming. Furthermore, ducks and geese are social animals and individual cages prevent such interactions.\n\nDuring the force feeding period, when the birds are not being fed, they are sometimes kept in near darkness; this prevents normal investigatory behaviour and results in poor welfare.\n\nLesions can occur on the sternum of the birds due to necrosis of the skin. This is observed more frequently in birds reared in cages rather than on the floor. The prevalence is higher in Mulard ducks (40–70%) compared to under 6% in Muscovy ducks. This is due to the larger pectoralis profundus major and minor muscles in Muscovy ducks compared to Mulards. The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems more prone to developing lesions in the area of the sternum when kept in small cages, and to bone breakage during transport and slaughter.\n\nWhere ducks are fattened in group pens, it has been suggested that the increased effort required to capture and restrain ducks in pens might cause them to experience more stress during force feeding. Injuries and fatalities during transport and slaughter occur in all types of poultry production, however, fattened ducks are more susceptible to conditions such as heat stress.\n\nFoie gras production results in the bird's liver being swollen. In some species of ducks, liver size changes seasonally, increasing by as much as 30 to 50%, with more pronounced changes in females. However, foie gras production enlarges the livers up to 10 times their normal size. This impairs liver function due to obstructing blood flow, and expands the abdomen making it difficult for the birds to breathe. Death occurs if the force-feeding is continued.\n\nThe mortality rate in force-fed birds varies from 2% to 4%, compared with approximately 0.2% in age-matched, non-force-fed drakes. Mortality rates do not differ between the force-feeding period and the previous rearing phase, with both being approximately 2.5%.\n\nThe polarising and controversial nature of foie gras production was identified in a paper that juxtaposed the views of \"foie gras production as the apotheosis of murderous meat production, and those who consider it to be a co-production between humans and animals\".\n\nAnimal rights and welfare advocates such as PETA, Viva!, and the Humane Society of the United States contend that foie gras production methods, and force-feeding in particular, constitute cruel and inhumane treatment of animals.\n\nAn Ipsos MORI poll found that 63% of the UK population would like to see a complete ban on the sale of foie gras in the UK.\n\nIn April–May 2013, an investigator from Mercy for Animals recorded undercover video at Hudson Valley Foie Gras farm in New York state. The video showed workers forcefully pushing tubes down ducks' throats. One worker said of the force-feeding process: \"Sometimes the duck doesn't get up and it dies. There have been times that 20 ducks were killed.\" Hudson Valley operations manager Marcus Henley replied that the farm's mortality statistics are not above average for the poultry industry. Because Hudson Valley provides foie gras to Amazon.com, Mercy for Animals began a campaign urging Amazon to stop selling foie gras, a move that has already been made by Costco, Safeway, and Target.\n\nIn November 2013, the \"Daily Mirror\" published a report based on the video they obtained depicting cruelty towards ducks in a farm owned by French firm Ernest Soulard, which is a supplier to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. The restaurant chain suspended purchasing from the supplier following the exposé.\n\nThe process of force-feeding can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption of which has been found to induce amyloidosis in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nA number of countries and regions have laws against force-feeding or the sale or importation of foie gras, and even where it is legal some retailers have ceased to sell it.\n\nIn 2017, foie gras production was banned in Brussels - the capital of Belgium, which is one of the relatively few remaining countries that produces foie gras.\n\nA more humane version of foie gras was pioneered in the Spanish region of Extremadura, whereby the bird is tricked into preparing for migration rather than force-fed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Due to its moderately high price, smoked salmon is considered a delicacy. Although the term lox is sometimes applied to smoked salmon, they are different products.\n\nSmoked salmon is a popular ingredient in canapés, often combined with cream cheese and lemon juice.\n\nIn North America, smoked salmon is likely to be sliced very thinly and served on bread with cream cheese or with sliced red onion, lemon and capers. In Pacific Northwest cuisine of the United States and Canada, smoked salmon may also be fillets or nuggets, including hickory or alder-smoked varieties and candied salmon (smoked and honey, or sugar-glazed, also known as \"Indian candy\").\n\nIn Europe, smoked salmon may be found thinly sliced or in thicker fillets, or sold as chopped \"scraps\" for use in cooking. It is often used in pâtés, quiches and pasta sauces. Scrambled eggs with smoked salmon mixed in is another popular dish. Smoked salmon salad is a strong-flavored salad, with ingredients such as iceberg lettuce, boiled eggs, tomato, olives, capers and leeks, and with flavored yogurt as a condiment.\n\nSlices of smoked salmon are a popular appetizer in Europe, usually served with some kind of bread. In the United Kingdom they are typically eaten with brown bread and a squeeze of lemon. In Germany they are eaten on toast or black bread.\n\nIn Jewish cuisine, smoked or brined salmon is called lox and is usually eaten on a bagel with cream cheese.\n\nSmoked salmon is sometimes used in sushi, though not widely in Japan; it is more likely to be encountered in North American sushi bars. The Philly Roll combines smoked salmon and cream cheese and rolls these in rice and nori.\n\nSmoking is used to preserve salmon against microorganism spoilage. During the process of smoking salmon the fish is cured and partially dehydrated, which impedes the activity of bacteria. An important example of this is \"Clostridium botulinum\", which can be present in seafood, and which is killed by the high heat treatment which occurs during the smoking process.\n\nSmoked salmon has featured in the cultures of the Native Americans for a long time. Smoked salmon was also a common dish in Greek and Roman culture throughout history, often being eaten at large gatherings and celebrations. During the Middle Ages, smoked salmon became part of people’s diet and was consumed in soups and salads. The first smoking factory was from Poland in the 7th century A.D. The 19th century marked the rise of the American smoked salmon industry in the West Coast, processing Pacific salmon from Alaska and Oregon.\n\nSalmon is a fish with high fat content and smoked salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Smoked salmon has a high sodium content due to the salt added during brining and curing. Three ounces of smoked salmon contains approximately 660 mg of sodium, while an equivalent portion of fresh cooked salmon contains about 50 mg. Although high salt content prevents the growth of microorganisms in smoked salmon by limiting water activity, the American Heart Association recommends limiting sodium consumption.\n\nSmoked foods, including smoked salmon also contain nitrates and nitrites which are by-products of the smoking process. Nitrites and nitrates can be converted into nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogenic. However, smoked salmon is not a major source of nitrosamine exposure to humans.\n\nStudies have been conducted in which some of the sodium chloride used in smoking salmon had been replaced by potassium chloride. The study found that up to one third of the sodium chloride can be replaced by potassium chloride without changing the sensory properties of the smoked salmon. Although potassium chloride has a bitter and metallic taste, the saltiness of the smoked salmon might have masked its undesirable flavor.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Based on a 2,000 calorie diet - Serving size: about 3 oz, (4 slices) cooked, about 85 grams\n\nIn the Atlantic basin all smoked salmon comes from the Atlantic salmon, much of it farmed in Norway, Scotland, Ireland and the east coast of Canada (particularly in the Bay of Fundy). In the Pacific, a variety of salmon species may be used. Because fish farming is prohibited by state law, all of Alaska's salmon species are wild Pacific species. Pacific species of salmon include chinook (\"King\"), sockeye (\"red\"), coho (\"silver\"), chum (\"keta\"), and pink (\"humpback\").\n\nMost smoked salmon is cold smoked, typically at 37 °C (99 °F). Cold smoking does not cook the fish, resulting in a delicate texture. Although some smoke houses go for a deliberately 'oaky' style with prolonged exposure to smoke from oak chips, industrial production favours less exposure to smoke and a blander style, using cheaper woods.\n\nOriginally, prepared fish were upside hung in lines on racks, or tenters, within the kiln. Workers would climb up and straddle the racks while hanging the individual lines in ascending order. Small circular wood chip fires would be lit at floor level and allowed to smoke slowly throughout the night. The wood fire was damped with sawdust to create smoke; this was constantly tended as naked flames would cook the fish rather than smoke it. The required duration of smoking has always been gauged by a skilled or 'master smoker' who manually checks for optimum smoking conditions.\n\nSmoked salmon was introduced into the UK from Eastern Europe. Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland brought the technique of salmon smoking to London's east End, where they settled, in the late 19th century. They smoked salmon as way to preserve it as refrigeration was very basic. In the early years, they were not aware that there was a salmon native to the UK so they imported Baltic salmon in barrels of salt water. However, having discovered the wild Scottish salmon coming down to the fish market at Billingsgate each summer, they started smoking these fish instead. The smoking process has changed over the years and many contemporary smokehouses have left the traditional methods using brick kilns behind in favour of commercial methods. Only a handful of traditional smokehouses remain such as John Ross Jr (Aberdeen) Ltd and the Stornoway Smokehouse in the Outer Hebrides. The oldest smokehouse in Scotland is the Old Salmon Fish House built on the banks of the River Ugie in 1585, although not at first for smoking. The oldest smokehouse in England is the 1760 Old Smokehouse in Raglan Street, Lowestoft. \n\nThe Northwest Indian Tribes and Alaska Natives have a cold smoking style that is wholly unique, resulting in a dried, \"jerky-style\" smoked salmon. In the Pacific Northwest this style of salmon has been used for centuries as a primary source of food for numerous Indian tribes. Traditionally smoked salmon has been a staple of north-western American tribes and Canadian First Nations people. To preserve indefinitely in modern times, the fish is typically pressure-cooked.\n\nCommonly used for both salmon and trout, hot smoking 'cooks' the salmon making it less moist, and firmer, with a less delicate taste. It may be eaten like cold smoked salmon, or mixed with salads or pasta. It is essential to brine the salmon sufficiently and dry the skin enough to form a pellicle prior to smoking. Without a sufficient pellicle, albumin will ooze out of the fish as it cooks, resulting in an unsightly presentation.\n\nThere are three main curing methods that are typically used to cure salmon prior to smoking.\n\n\nThe proteins in the fish are modified (denatured) by the salt, which enables the flesh of the salmon to hold moisture better than it would if not brined. In the United States, the addition of salt is regulated by the FDA as it is a major processing aid to ensure the safety of the product. The sugar is hydrophilic, and also adds to the moistness of the smoked salmon. Salt and sugar are also preservatives, extending the storage life and freshness of the salmon. Table salt (iodized salt) is not used in any of these methods, as the iodine can impart a dark color and bitter taste to the fish.\n\nIndian hard smoked salmon is first kippered with salt, sugar and spices and then smoked until hard and jerky-like. See cured salmon. The Scandinavian dish gravlax is cured, but is not smoked.\n\nIn British Columbia, canning salmon can be traced back to Alexander Loggie in 1870 who established the first recorded commercial cannery on the Fraser River. Canning soon became the preferred method of preserving salmon in BC growing from three canneries in 1876 to more than ninety by the turn of the century. Sockeye and Pink Salmon make up the majority of canned salmon, with the traditional product containing skin and bones – important sources of calcium and nutrients.\n\nThe enzymes of fish operate at an optimum temperature of about 5 °C, the temperature of the water from which they came. Bacteriologically sterile, fish still have a large number of bacteria in their slimy surface and digestive tracts. These bacteria multiply rapidly once the fish dies and start to attack the tissues. The growth of microorganism can greatly affect the quality of the salmon.\n\nThe salmon is first dressed and washed, then cut into pieces and filled in cans (previously sterilized) in saline. The cans must then undergo a double steaming process in a vacuum-sealed environment. The steam is pressurized at 121.1 °C for 90 minutes to kill any bacteria. After heating, the cans are cooled under running water, dried and stored in a controlled environment between 10-15.5 °C. Before leaving the canneries, they are examined to ensure both the can integrity and safety of the fish.\n\nThe Canadian Food and Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for policies, labeling requirements, permitted additives, and inspections for all fish products. All establishments which process fish for export or inter-provincial trade must be registered federally and implement a Quality Management Program (QMP) plan.\n\nCooking low-acid food items in a retortable pouch is a relatively new process, with the first commercial use of such retort pouches found in Italy in 1960, Denmark in 1966, and in Japan in 1969. It consists of enclosing the fish in \"a multilayer flexible packaging consisting mainly of polypropylene (PP), aluminum foil, and polyester (PET)\" instead of the metal can or glass jar used in canning; but from there the technique is quite similar. Four different retort pouch structures were used; namely cast polypropylene (CPP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/silicon oxide-coated nylon/CPP (SIOX), Aluminum oxide-coated PET/nylon/CPP (ALOX), and PET/aluminum foil/CPP (FOIL).\n\n\n\nIn the UK, \"Scottish smoked salmon\" is sometimes used to refer to salmon that is smoked in Scotland but sourced from elsewhere. This is despite Food Standards Agency recommendations that such salmon be described as \"Salmon smoked in Scotland\" instead. Labelling must also include the method of production ('farmed', 'cultivated', 'caught').\n\nSmoked salmon jerky is a dehydrated salmon product that is bought ready to eat for consumers and requires no further refrigeration or cooking. (Note there are \"fresh\" non-heat treated versions made by smaller local producers that require refrigeration.) It is typically made from the trimmings and by-products of salmon products in other smoking facilities. Smoked salmon jerky undergoes the most heat processing of all other smoked salmon products yet still maintains its quality as a good source of omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nThe two main processing techniques for salmon jerky are wet-brining and dry salting. In both cases the salmon is trimmed into narrow slices and then stored cold for less than one day. After being skinned and frozen, if the fish is to undergo the brining method it will require an additional step in which the salmon is left soaking in wet brine (salt solution) for one hour. It is then removed and the excess water is discarded. After this, in both the wet-brining and dry salting method, ingredients such as non-iodized salt, potato starch, or light brown sugar are added. In some smoked salmon jerky products preservatives may also be added to extend the shelf life of the final product. The salmon is then minced with the additives and reformed into thin strips that will be smoked for twenty hours. Between the brining and salting methods for smoked salmon jerky the brining method has been found to leave the salmon more tender with up to double the moisture content of salted jerky. The salmon jerky that undergoes the dry salting method has a tougher texture due to the lower moisture content and water activity. Both forms of salmon jerky still have a much lower moisture content than is found in raw salmon.\n\nSmoked salmon jerky is packaged using aseptic packaging to ensure the product is in a sterilized environment. The smoked salmon jerky is commonly packaged in a vacuum sealed bag in which the oxygen has been removed, or in a controlled atmospheric package in which the oxygen has been replaced with Nitrogen to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Because of the high heat nature of which smoked salmon jerky is processed it is a shelf stable product. Depending on the integrity of the packaging and if preservatives were used, smoked salmon jerky may have an approximate shelf-life of six months to one year. Smaller local producers of salmon jerky make a \"fresh\", non-heat treated product that is not shelf stable.\n\n\n"}

It was devised by the Danish Situationist Asger Jorn to explain his notion of triolectics, his refinement on the Marxian concept of dialectics, as well as to disrupt one's everyday idea of football. Played on a hexagonal pitch , the game can be adapted for similarity to soccer as well as other versions of football.\n\nUnlike conventional football, where the winner is determined by the highest scoring of the two teams, in three-sided football the winning team is that which concedes the fewest goals.\n\nThe first known game of 3SF, played on Friday 28 May 1993, was organized by the London Psychogeographical Association on Glasgow Green as part of the Glasgow Anarchist Summer School. Participants included Richard Essex, Stewart Home and the members of The Workshop for Non-Linear Architecture.\n\nThree-sided football has been practiced in various training sessions of the Association of Autonomous Astronauts in England, France, Italy and Austria, including the 1st Intergalactic Conference in Vienna (1997), the 2nd Intergalactic Conference in Bologna (1998), the Space 1999 in London, or as a protest event in Parc de La Villette during the 1998 two-sided football World Cup in Paris.\n\nThe Deptford Three Sided Football Club (D3FC) was founded in February 2012 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Jorn's invention of the game in his 1962 book Naturens Orden. Games were held every other Sunday between D3FC and other local clubs at the Deptford Green Hexagon in Fordham Park, South East London.\n\nThe first three-sided football match in Turkey was organized by InEnArt on 14 September 2013, to coincide with the 13th Istanbul Biennial. The match was played in front of Kadir Has University, Istanbul between Philosophy Football FC from the UK, FSC Dynamo Windrad Kassel from Germany and Ayazma FC from Turkey. The referee was Halil İbrahim Dinçdağ, who was suspended by the Turkish Football Federation in 2009 because of his sexuality. Geoff Andrews, manager of Philosophy Football FC, launched the International Three Sided Football Federation before this match.\n\nThe first three sided football match in Australia was held on the 4th of May 2014. It was held at St Kilda Primary School in Melbourne and featured the 'St Kilda All Sartres', Pythagoras 3FC (the Pys) and Atletico Geometry (the Geometers). The teams were mixed - an important feature of Australian Three Sided Football.\n\nThe first 3SF World Cup took place in cooperation with the International Three Sided Football Federation and the Museum Jorn in Silkeborg, Denmark, May 23 until May 25, 2014. Teams from France, Germany, Poland, England, Lithuania and Denmark sought to win the Cup. The Danish team Silkeborg KFUM were crowned champions.\n\nThe second 3SF World Cup was held at the in Kassel, Germany on Sat 19 August, 2017. The tournament was hosted by Dynamo Windrad as part of documenta 14 and featured twelve teams originating from Germany, England, Poland and Lithuania.\n\nThe final was contested between local side F2 Versenkt and two teams from the SE London league, Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals. In a very tight and tactical game, New Cross Internationals scored the only goal of the game against F2 Versenkt. Although Polish Husaria and New Cross Internationals both finished the game with clean sheets, the rules of the tournament stated that in cases of a winning draw the team who scored the most goals in the match would be considered the winner. Therefore, New Cross Internationals were declared winners of the tournament.\n\nAfter the final it transpired that Polish Husaria had not been aware of the rule regarding goals scored, and because of this New Cross Internationals offered to share the title with Polish Husaria.\n\nThe next 3SF World Cup will be held in 2020 in London.\n\nIn September 2014 Deptford Three Sided Football Club embarked on a new experiment in trialectics by establishing a formal league structure with five other teams from the local area. The inaugural teams involved in the league were Aesthetico Athletico, New Cross Irregulars 3FC, Philosophy Football Club, Polsky Budowlancy (now named Husaria), Strategic Optimists Football Club and, of course, Deptford Three Sided Football Club.[17] \n\nThe inaugural season ended on the 7th of June 2015 with New Cross Irregulars being awarded the trophy, having mathematically won the title in the penultimate game of the season.\n\nThe same six teams played in the 2015-16 season. It was decided on the final game of the season, with Husaria, Aesthetico Athletico and New Cross Irregulars 3FC playing each other in a match where all three teams could win the title. Defending champions NXI were taken out of contention early on, conceding 5 goals in total, and Husaria were crowned new champions courtesy of a single goal against Aesthetico.\n\nNXI, Aesthetico and Strategic Optimists all ended in joint second place, a single point behind winners Husaria.\n\nNXI reclaimed the league title in the penultimate game of the season on 07 May, 2017 with a win over Deptford and Aesthetico.\n\nUp to this point Husaria still had a chance of defending their title, but came second in their May match to concede the point that handed the league to NXI.\n\nIn January 2017 the first season of the Triball 3SF league was established. Duplicating the Deptford points structure for the league table, Triball is played in a 4-a-side format between seven league teams. The league also hosts a cup competition called the Triball Open Cup.\n\nOn 31 October 2009, a three sided football competition was organised in Lyon during the Biennale d'art contemporain de Lyon. The subversive event was a confrontation of the non spectacular sense of the original game with the main title of the Biennale, Le Spectacle du Quoditidien. The manifestation took place in Stade Laurent Gérin, Vénissieux and was organised by Pied La Biche association.[2]\n\nIn an event called \"Thinking Football\", aiming to reflect on the role of football in modern society, the Athletic de Bilbao Foundation organised among other things a three sided football championship taking place from October 2011 to April 2012 with 37 participant teams.\n\nIn August 2009, a three-sided football game was played in Alytus as part of the Art Strike events there. Stewart Home acted as referee.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2010 UK General Election, a three-sided football game was played on 2 May 2010 in Haggerston Park, with each team representing one of the main political parties. This match was organised by Whitechapel Gallery in conjunction with Philosophy Football FC. The match was won by Philosophy Football FC, representing Labour, who conceded no goals to the Conservatives' 2 and Lib Dems' 3.[4] Philosophy Football FC later organised and competed in the first ever three-sided football match to be played in Spain, on 7 May 2011, which was discussed by journalist Sid Lowe in the \"Guardian\"'s football podcast. Lowe's team won 3-5-5.\n\nHome to two different Three-sided football leagues, South London hosts an active community of 3SF, mostly played in New Cross at Fordham Park, and London Bridge at Tabard Gardens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "231887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231887", "title": "Dandelion and burdock", "text": "Dandelion and burdock\n\nDandelion and burdock is a beverage consumed in the British Isles since the Middle Ages. It was originally a type of light mead, but over the years has evolved into the carbonated soft drink commercially available today. Traditionally it was made from fermented dandelion (\"Taraxacum officinale\") and burdock (\"Arctium lappa\") roots, hence the name.\n\nDandelion and burdock shares a historical origin with a number of drinks originally made from lightly fermented root extracts, such as root beer and sarsaparilla, supposedly as a health benefit. One story regarding its origin is that in the 13th Century St. Thomas Aquinas, after a hard night's praying, stumbled out in the dawn and \"trusting in God to Provide\" brewed a concoction from the first two plants he encountered.\n\nThe dominant flavour in these other drinks is usually sassafras or wintergreen, both now derived artificially rather than from the plant itself, in part because during the 1960s safrole, the major component of the volatile oil of sassafras, was found to be carcinogenic in rats when administered in relatively large doses. All of these drinks, while tasting similar, do have their own distinct flavour. Dandelion and burdock is most similar in flavour to sarsaparilla. The drink has recently seen an increase in popularity after previously poor sales.\n\nThe \"dandelion and burdock\" drink for sale in many retail outlets rarely contains either plant. The retail drink is often carbonated, containing artificial sweeteners and flavourings. Some supermarkets sell the drink with \"real plant extracts\" with a more faithful flavour than the ones made with artificial flavourings.\n\nFentimans, a beverage company based in the United Kingdom, offers a version of the naturally brewed dandelion and burdock drink, containing extracts of both plants (although its main ingredients are sugar and pear juice concentrate).\n\nA.G. Barr, famous for Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru, produce a version of dandelion and burdock under the name \"D'n'B\" and the slogan \"Tall, dark and drinksome\".\n\nThe last of the UK's original temperance bars, Fitzpatrick's in Rawtenstall, which opened in 1890, still produces its dandelion and burdock to an original recipe brought over from Ireland at the end of the 19th century.\n\nMentioned in the title track for \"Suck It and See\" (2011) by Sheffield indie rock band Arctic Monkeys.\n\nMentioned in Gail Honeyman’s 2017 fictional book titled \"Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine\".\n\nMentioned in Stephen Fry's 1997 autobiography \"Moab is My Washpot\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231986", "title": "Saumagen", "text": "Saumagen\n\nSaumagen is a German dish popular in the Palatinate. The name means \"sow's stomach\". The dish is similar to a sausage in that it consists of a stuffed casing; however, the stomach itself is integral to the dish. It isn't as thin as a typical sausage casing (intestines or artificial casing). Rather it is meat-like, being a strong muscular organ, and when the dish is finished by being pan-fried or roasted in the oven, it becomes crisp. The dish is somewhat similar to the Scottish haggis, although the stuffing is quite different.\n\nSaumagen stuffing consists of potatoes and pork, usually spiced with onions, marjoram, nutmeg and white pepper, in addition to which, various recipes also mention cloves, coriander, thyme, garlic, bay leaf, cardamom, basil, caraway, allspice, and parsley. Sometimes beef is used as well; a variant popular in autumn replaces some or all of the potatoes with chestnuts. The larger ingredients are diced finely. After that, the saumagen is cooked in hot water, slightly below boiling temperature to prevent rupture of the stomach. It is either served directly with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes or stored in the refrigerator for later use. To warm it again, the saumagen is cut into slices approximately , which are then fried in an open pan. The typical accompanying drink is - in the wine region of the Palatinate - usually a dry white wine, and in the Palatinate forest to the west, preferably a local beer.\n\nThere is controversy regarding the origin of the dish: One theory claims that Saumagen was created in the 18th century by Palatinate farmers to make use of slaughter swerves. Another theory insists that Saumagen has always been the highlight of each local Schlachtfest in the Palatinate region, a festival that involved the ceremonial slaughter of a pig and that is still celebrated in some wine-growing districts when the vintage is finished and when winter is near. Today the Saumagen offered by German butchers and restaurants uses high quality ingredients. Luise Wilhelmine Henninger (1871–1951), cook and landlady at the Weinhaus Henninger in Kallstadt, is said to have saved the largely forgotten Saumagen recipe and to have elevated it to a culinary delight, eventually. The dish lends its name to a Riesling vineyard in Kallstadt as \"Saumagen Kallstadt\".\n\nHelmut Kohl, the German chancellor from 1982 to 1998, loved Saumagen and had it served to visiting premiers, including Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Kohl came from the Palatinate and his enthusiasm for the very local dish brought it to a wider public. Some Germans viewed this attachment as a sign that Kohl was unsophisticated and provincial, but some saw it as a clever way of advertising his home region, as local butchers and restaurants experienced an increase of (Saumagen) sales during and after state visits. \n\nThe Schlotte Carnival society in Schifferstadt has awarded the Order of the Saumagen since 1992. Landau hosts a Saumagen-competition, the \"Internationale Pfälzer Saumagen-Wettbewerb\". Unique receipes include e.g. fish or deer stuffing. The first laureates, Imke Bruns and Iris Wittmann are now members of the jury.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania Dutch region of the United States, the dish, known locally as seimaage, hogmal, stuffed hog maw (\"maw\" is an old word for stomach), simply pig stomach, or Dutch goose (by those who are not Pennsylvania Dutch) is popular during the harvest season. Traditionally, pig stomach, not turkey, was the main course for Thanksgiving among Pennsylvania Dutch families. This tradition stems from the Old World, with the bulk of Pennsylvania Dutch settlers originating from the Palatinate. Unlike the German version, the dish is typically baked for several hours, rather than boiled.\n"}

Whole fruits are cooked in water with sugar and spices. The syrup may be seasoned with vanilla, lemon or orange peel, cinnamon sticks or powder, cloves, other spices, ground almonds, grated coconut, candied fruit, or raisins. The compote is served either warm or cold.\n\nCompote conformed to the medieval belief that fruit cooked in sugar syrup balanced the effects of humidity on the body. The name is derived from the Latin word \"compositus\", meaning mixture. In late medieval England it was served at the beginning of the last course of a feast (or sometimes the second of three courses), often accompanied by a creamy potage. During the Renaissance, it was served chilled at the end of dinner. Because it was easy to prepare, made from inexpensive ingredients and contained no dairy products, compote became a staple of Jewish households throughout Europe. In modern French, the term refers to usually unsweetened fruit purée without fruit chunks, such as applesauce.\n\nThe dessert may be topped with whipped cream, cinnamon, or vanilla sugar. The syrup may be made with wine, as in one early 15th century recipe for pear compote. Other preparations consist of using dried fruits which have been soaked in water in which alcohol can be added, for example kirsch, rum, or Frontignan.\n\n"}

It is traditionally white with red stripes and flavored with peppermint, but they also come in a variety of other flavors and colors.\n\nAccording to a folklore, in 1670, in Cologne, Germany, the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral, wishing to remedy the noise caused by children in his church during the Living Crèche tradition of Christmas Eve, asked a local candy maker for some \"sugar sticks\" for them. In order to justify the practice of giving candy to children during worship services, he asked the candy maker to add a crook to the top of each stick, which would help children remember the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus. In addition, he used the white colour of the converted sticks to teach children about the Christian belief in the sinless life of Jesus. From Germany, candy canes spread to other parts of Europe, where they were handed out during plays reenacting the Nativity. As such, according to this legend, the candy cane became associated with Christmastide.\n\nA record of the 1837 Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, where confections were judged competitively, mentions \"stick candy\". A recipe for straight peppermint candy sticks, white with coloured stripes, was published in 1844. The \"candy cane\" is found in literature in 1866, though no description of color or flavor was provided. \"The Nursery\" monthly magazine noted them in association with Christmas in 1874, and the \"Babyland\" magazine mentioned canes being hung on Christmas trees in 1882.\n\nAs with other forms of stick candy, the earliest canes were manufactured by hand. Chicago confectioners the Bunte Brothers filed one of the earliest patents for candy cane making machines in the early 1920s.\nIn 1919 in Albany, Georgia, Robert McCormack began making candy canes for local children and by the middle of the century, his company (originally the Famous Candy Company, then the Mills-McCormack Candy Company, and later Bobs Candies) had become one of the world's leading candy cane producers. Candy cane manufacturing initially required a fair bit of labor that limited production quantities; the canes had to be bent manually as they came off the assembly line to create their curved shape and breakage often ran over 20 percent. McCormack's brother-in-law, Gregory Harding Keller, was a seminary student in Rome who spent his summers working in the candy factory back home. In 1957, Keller, as an ordained Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Little Rock, patented his invention, the Keller Machine, which automated the process of twisting soft candy into spiral striping and cutting it into precise lengths as candy canes.\n\nOn Saint Nicholas Day celebrations, candy canes are given to children as they are also said to represent the crosier of the Christian bishop, Saint Nicholas; crosiers allude to the Good Shepherd, an epithet associated with Jesus.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been translated as \"freedom\", as well as \"manumission\", \"exemption from debts or obligations\", and \"the restoration of persons and property to their original status\" including the remission of debts. Other interpretations include a \"reversion to a previous state\" and release from debt, slavery, taxation or punishment.\n\nThe word originates from the noun \"ama\" \"mother\" (sometimes with the enclitic dative case marker \"ar\"), and the present participle \"gi\" \"return, restore, put back\", thus literally meaning \"returning to mother\". Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer has identified it as the first known written reference to the concept of freedom. Referring to its literal meaning \"return to the mother\", he wrote in 1963 that \"we still do not know why this figure of speech came to be used for \"freedom.\"\"\n\nThe earliest known usage of the word was in the reforms of Urukagina. By the Third Dynasty of Ur, it was used as a legal term for the manumission of individuals.\n\nIt is related to the Akkadian word \"anduraāru(m)\", meaning \"freedom\", \"exemption\" and \"release from (debt) slavery\".\n"}
{"id": "234224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234224", "title": "Praline", "text": "Praline\n\nPraline (; ) is a form of confection containing at a minimum culinary nuts and sugar; cream is a common third ingredient.\n\nThere are three main types:\n\nA praline cookie is a chocolate biscuit containing ground nuts. Praline is usually used as a filling in chocolates or other sweets.\n\nPraline may have originally been inspired in France by the cook of Marshal du Plessis-Praslin (1598–1675), with the word \"praline\" deriving from the name \"Praslin\". Early pralines were whole almonds individually coated in caramelized sugar, as opposed to dark nougat, where a sheet of caramelized sugar covers many nuts.\nAlthough the New World had been discovered and settled by this time, chocolate-producing cocoa from there was originally not associated with the term. The European chefs used local nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts.\n\nThe powder made by grinding up such caramel-coated nuts is called \"pralin\", and is an ingredient in many cakes, pastries, and ice creams. After this powder has been mixed with chocolate, it becomes \"praliné\" in French, which gave birth to what is known in French as \"chocolat praliné\". The word \"praliné\" is used colloquially in France and Switzerland to refer to these various centres coated with chocolate, known simply as \"chocolates\" in English. In mainland Europe, the word praline is often used to mean either this nut powder or the chocolate paste made from it, which is widely used to fill chocolates, hence its use in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom to refer to filled chocolates in general. In the United Kingdom, the term can refer either to praline (the filling for chocolates) or, less commonly, to the original whole-nut pralines.\n\nPralines from Belgium are also known as \"(soft-center) Belgian chocolates\", \"Belgian chocolate fondants\" and \"chocolate bonbons\" in English-speaking countries — cases of chocolate (if from Belgium usually a quality, branded lower-melting point Belgian chocolate) filled with a soft centre. They were first introduced by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian chocolatier, in 1912.\n\nThere have always been many types and shapes: nearly always containing a chocolate shell with a softer filling. Confusion can arise over the use of the word praline in Belgium as it may refer to filled chocolates in general known as pralines and it may also refer to a traditional praline filling common in Europe (caramelised hazelnuts (noisettes) or almonds (amandes) ground into a paste, sometimes with whey powder, condensed milk or cream) described as praliné . Belgian chocolates (pralines) are not limited to the traditional praliné filling and often include nuts, marzipan, salted caramel, coffee, a spirit, cream liqueur, cherry or a chocolate blend that contrasts with the outer shell. They are often sold in stylised boxes in the form of a gift box. The largest manufacturers are Neuhaus, Godiva, Leonidas, and Guylian.\n\nFrench settlers brought the recipe to Louisiana, where both sugar cane and pecan trees were plentiful. During the 19th century, New Orleans chefs substituted pecans for almonds, added cream to thicken the confection, and thus created what became known throughout the American South as the praline.\n\nPralines have a creamy consistency, similar to fudge. They are usually made by combining sugar (often brown), butter, cream or buttermilk, and pecans in a pot over medium-high heat, and stirring constantly until most of the water has evaporated and it has reached a thick texture with a brown color. This is then usually dropped by spoonfuls onto wax paper or a sheet of aluminum foil greased with butter, and left to cool.\n\n'Pralines and Cream' is a common ice cream flavor in the United States and Canada. In New Orleans, Acadiana, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pralines are sometimes called \"pecan candy\".\n\n"}
{"id": "234721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234721", "title": "Chapati", "text": "Chapati\n\nChapati (alternatively spelled chapatti, chappati, chapathi, or chappathi), (pronounced as IAST: ), also known as \"roti\", \"safati\", \"shabaati\", \"phulka\" and (in the Maldives) \"roshi,\" is an unleavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent and staple in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, East Africa and the Caribbean. Chapatis are made of whole wheat flour known as atta, mixed into dough with water and optional salt in a mixing utensil called a \"parat\", and is cooked on a \"tava\" (flat skillet).\n\nIt is a common staple in the Indian subcontinent as well as amongst expatriates from the Indian subcontinent throughout the world. Chapatis were also introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean islands.\n\nThe word \"chapat\" (Hindi:चपत) means \"slap\",\"flat\" which describes the traditional method of forming rounds of thin dough by slapping the dough between the wetted palms of the hands. With each slap, the round of dough is rotated. \"Chapati\" is noted in the 16th-century document \"Ain-i-Akbari\" by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, vizier of Mughal Emperor Akbar.\n\nChapatis are one of the most common forms of wheat bread which are a staple food in the Indian subcontinent. The carbonized wheat grains discovered at the excavations at Mohenjo-daro are of a similar variety to an endemic species of wheat still to be found in India today. The Indus valley is known to be one of the ancestral lands of cultivated wheat. Chapati is a form of \"roti\" or \"rotta\" (bread). The words are often used interchangeably.\n\nChapatis, along with rotis, were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, particularly by Indian merchants who settled in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean islands.\n\nChapatis are made using a soft dough comprising Wheat flour, salt and water. It is more finely ground than most western-style whole wheat flours. Traditionally, roti (and rice) are prepared without salt to provide a bland background for spiced dishes.\n\nChapati dough is typically prepared with 'flour, salt and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to proof for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to develop. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a \"chakla\"), using a rolling pin known as a \"velan\" or \"belan\", into a flat disc. There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.\n\nThe rolled-out dough is then thrown on the preheated dry \"tava\" and cooked on both sides. In some regions of the Indian subcontinent chapatis are only partially cooked on the skillet, and then put directly on a high flame, which makes them blow up like a balloon. The hot air cooks the chapati rapidly from the inside. In some parts of northern India and eastern Pakistan, this is called a \"phulka\". In southern parts of India, it is called a \"pulka\". It is also possible to puff up the roti directly on the tava. Once cooked, chapatis are often topped with butter or ghee. In western regions of Maharashtra, some oil is added inside rolled out dough and then put on tava, this is distinct from paratha.\n\nChapati diameter and thickness vary from region to region. Chapatis made in domestic kitchens are usually not larger than to in diameter since the \"tava\" on which they are made comes in sizes that fit comfortably on a domestic stovetop. \"Tavas\" were traditionally made of unglazed earthenware, but are now typically made from metal. The shape of the rolling pin also varies from region to region. Some households simply use a kitchen worktop as a sort of pastry board, but round flat-topped \"boards\" made of wood, stone, or stainless steel are available specifically for rolling out chapatis.\n\nIn most parts of the Indian subcontinent, there is a distinction made between a \"chapati\" and other related flatbreads eaten in the region like roti, paratha, kulcha, puri and naan based on cooking technique, texture and use of different types of flours. For example, parathas are either made layered by spreading with ghee, folding and rolling out again into a disc which turns out flakey once cooked or is filled with spinach, dal or cooked radish or potato. Parathas are mostly made using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.\n\nThere are many regional varieties of chapati in India.\n\n\nIn the Maldives, chapatis are traditionally eaten for breakfast along with a dish known as \"mas huni\".\n\nThe Indian breads are tasty and equally nutritious. The chapatis or Indian flatbread is a part of Indian staple food. Chapatis go well accompanies with curries, dry sabjis, chutneys or dal.\n\n"}
{"id": "235662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235662", "title": "Goulash", "text": "Goulash\n\nGoulash ( ) is a stew (or soup) of meat and vegetables usually seasoned with paprika and other spices. Originating from medieval Hungary, goulash is a popular meal predominantly eaten in Central Europe but also in other parts of Europe. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.\n\nIts origin traces back to the 9th century to stews eaten by Hungarian shepherds. Back then, the cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep's stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal. Earlier versions of goulash did not include paprika, as it was not introduced to the Old World until the 16th century.\n\nThe name originates from the Hungarian \"\"gulyás\"\" . The word \"\"gulya\"\" means \"\"herd of cattle\"\" in Hungarian, and \"\"gulyás\"\" means \"\"herdsman\"\" or \"cowboy\".\n\nThe word gulyás originally meant only \"herdsman\", but over time the dish became gulyáshús (goulash meat) – that is to say, a meat dish which was prepared by herdsmen. Also in medieval times the Hungarian herdsman of Central Europe made use of every possible part of the animal, as was common practice. As meat was scarce, nearly all of the animal was often used to make the soup; even part of the hide that provided foot protection was considered a necessity. Today, gulyás refers both to the herdsmen, and to the soup. From the Middle Ages until well into the 19th century, the Puszta was the home of massive herds of cattle. They were driven, in their tens of thousands, to Europe’s biggest cattle markets in Moravia, Vienna, Nuremberg and Venice. The herdsmen made sure that there were always some cattle that had to be slaughtered along the way, the flesh of which provided them with gulyáshús.\n\nIn Hungarian cuisine, traditional \"\"Gulyásleves\"\" (literally \"\"goulash soup\"\"), \"\"bográcsgulyás\"\", pörkölt, and paprikás were thick stews made by cattle herders and stockmen. Garlic, caraway seed, bell pepper, and wine are optional. These dishes can be made as soups rather than stews. Excepting paprikás, the Hungarian stews do not rely on a flour or roux for thickening.\nTomato is a modern addition, totally unknown in the original recipe and in the whole Central European food culture until the first half of the twentieth century.\nGoulash is as well a fundamental part of Slovak cuisine, where is prepared in several different tastes too, mainly the same ones of Hungarian cuisine. Slovakia was an important part of the Kingdom of Hungary for several centuries, and the two cuisines have many common recipes.\n\nGoulash can be prepared from beef, veal, pork, or lamb. Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in collagen, which is converted to gelatin during the cooking process. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water or stock, and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground caraway seed, or soup vegetables like carrot, parsley root, peppers (green or bell pepper) and celery may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially chili pepper, bay leaf and thyme. Diced potatoes may be added, since they provide starch as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, chili peppers and potatoes are post-16th century additions, unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of white wine or wine vinegar may also be added near the end of cooking to round the taste. Goulash may be served with small egg noodles called \"csipetke\". The name \"Csipetke\" comes from pinching small, fingernail-sized bits out of the dough (\"csipet\" =pinch) before adding them to the boiling soup.\n\nThe Hungarian cook Karoly Gundel claims that in a goulash recipe, meat should not be mixed with any grains or with potatoes, so if potatoes or noodles are used, the meat should be omitted. Given the large number of goulash variants, however, this dictum is dubious.\n\nHungarian goulash variations include:\nA thicker and richer goulash, similar to a stew, originally made with three kinds of meat, is called \"Székely gulyás\", named after the Hungarian writer, journalist and archivist József Székely (1825–1895).\n\n\"Paprikás krumpli\" is a traditional paprika-based potato stew with diced potatoes, onion, bell peppers, ground paprika and some bacon or sliced spicy sausage, like the smoked Debrecener, in lieu of beef.\n\nIn German-speaking countries this inexpensive peasant stew is made with sausage and known as Kartoffelgulasch (\"potato goulash\").\n\nThick stews similar to \"pörkölt\" and the original cattlemen stew are popular throughout almost all the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire, from Northeast Italy to the Carpathians. Like \"pörkölt,\" these stews are generally served with boiled or mashed potato, polenta, dumplings (e.g. \"nokedli\", or \"galuska\"), spätzle or, alternatively, as a stand-alone dish with bread.\n\nIn Vienna, the former center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a special kind of goulash had been developed. The \"Wiener Saftgulasch\" or the \"Fiakergulasch\" on the menu in traditional restaurants is a rich \"pörkölt\"-like stew; more onions but no tomatoes or other vegetables are used, and it usually comes just with dark bread. A variation of the \"Wiener Saftgulasch\" is the \"Fiakergulasch\", which is served with fried egg, fried sausage, and dumplings named \"Semmelknödel\".\n\nGoulash () is also very popular in most parts of Croatia, especially north (Hrvatsko Zagorje) and Lika. In Gorski Kotar and Lika, venison or wild boar frequently replace beef (\"lovački gulaš\"). There is also a kind of goulash with porcini mushrooms (\"gulaš od vrganja\"). Bacon is an important ingredient.\n\nGulaš is often served with fuži, njoki, polenta or pasta. In Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian is augmented with vegetables. Green and red bell peppers and carrots are most commonly used. Sometimes one or more other kinds of meat are added, e.g., pork loin, bacon, or mutton. In Slovenia, they are known as \"perkelt,\" but are often referred to as \"goulash\" or a similar name.\n\nIn the Czech and Slovak Republics, goulash (Czech and Slovak: \"guláš\") is usually made with beef, although pork varieties exist, and served with bread dumplings (goulash with beef in Czech \"hovězí guláš s knedlíkem\", in Slovak \"hovädzí guláš s knedľou\"), in Slovakia more typically with bread. In pubs it is often garnished with slices of fresh onion, and is typically accompanied by beer. Beer can be also added to the stew in the process of cooking. Seasonal varieties of goulash include venison or wild boar goulashes. Another popular variant of \"guláš\" is \"segedínský guláš\" (\"Szeged goulash\"), with sauerkraut. \n\nIn Czech and Slovak slang, the word \"guláš\" means \"mishmash\", typically used as \"mít v tom guláš\": to be disoriented or to lack understanding of something.\n\nGerman \"Gulasch\" is either a beef (\"Rindergulasch\"), pork (\"Schweinegulasch\"), venison (\"Hirschgulasch\"), or wild boar (\"Wildschweingulasch\") stew that may include red wine and is usually served with potatoes (in the north), white rice or spirelli noodles (mostly in canteens), and dumplings (in the south). \"Gulaschsuppe\" (goulash soup) is the same concept served as a soup, usually with pieces of white bread.\n\nGoulash in Italy is eaten in the region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the autonomous region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, regions that had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and still are in part culturally and linguistically Austrian. Here it is eaten as a regular Sunday dish. It can also, although less typically so, be found in the nearby Veneto. An interesting regional recipe comes from the Pustertal (Val Pusteria, Puster Valley) in South Tyrol. It is made of beef and red wine, and seasoned with rosemary, red paprika, bay leaf, marjoram and lemon zest, served with crusty white bread or polenta. The lemon gives its signature flavor. Goulash is also quite popular in the city of Ancona, which is culturally quite near to eastern Europe.\n\nPhilippine Caldereta is a popular party dish enjoyed throughout the country. While it is often cooked using beef or pork, for special occasions, such as weddings and graduation parties, goat meat is used. This variation of goulash came to this south-east Asian country through its Spanish colonizers. Close to the Philippine Caldereta is the Spanish Chilindron. In addition to the onions and bell pepper found in the traditional goulash, a number of vegetables are included in this slow-cooked beef stew. Carrots, green peas, garlic, and potatoes are popular additions. For a richer and thicker sauce, liver spread or liver paste is added. It is served with warm rice. \n\nIn Poland, goulash () is popular and eaten in most parts of the country. A variant dish exists that is similar to Hungarian pörkölt. It came to being around the 9th century. It is usually served with various forms of noodles and dumplings, such as pyzy.\n\nIn Serbia, goulash () is eaten in most parts of the country, especially in Vojvodina, where it was probably introduced by the Hungarian minority. It is actually a pörkölt like stew, usually made with beef, veal or pork, but also with game meat like venison and boar. Compulsory ingredients are meat and onions, usually in 50-50% ratio, paprika, and lard or oil, other ingredients being optional: garlic, parsley, chilli pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, red wine, mushrooms, bacon. Sometimes, goulash is sweetened by adding tomato paste, sugar or dark chocolate at the very end. In Serbia, goulash is most often served with macaroni or potato mash.\n\nIn Slovene \"partizanski golaž\", \"partisan goulash\", favoured by Slovenian partisans during the Second World War, is still regularly served at mass public events. \"Partisan \"golaž\"\" utilizes onion in equal proportion to meat; Slovenians usually use two or more types of meat in cooking \"\"golaž\"\".\n\nAmerican goulash, mentioned in cookbooks since at least 1914, exists in a number of variant recipes. Originally a dish of seasoned beef, core ingredients of American goulash now usually include elbow macaroni, cubed steak, ground beef or \"hamburger\", and tomatoes in some form, whether canned whole, as tomato sauce, tomato soup, and/or tomato paste. In some areas it is called \"slumgullion\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "235841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235841", "title": "USS Dunderberg", "text": "USS Dunderberg\n\nUSS \"Dunderberg\", which is a Swedish word meaning \"thunder(ing) mountain,\" was an ocean-going casemate ironclad of 14 guns. She resembled an enlarged, two-masted version of the Confederate casemate ironclad . She was originally designed to have both gun turrets and a casemate but the turrets were deleted while the ship was still being built. Construction began in 1862, but progress was slow and she was not launched until after the end of the American Civil War in 1865.\n\nThe ship was not accepted by the Union Navy so its builder began seeking buyers elsewhere; Otto von Bismarck expressed some interest, and the thought of Prussia armed with such a vessel prompted France to purchase her and commission her in 1867 with the name Rochambeau. She was initially placed in reserve, but was mobilized in 1870 to participate in the Franco-Prussian War. The ship saw no action and was decommissioned after the end of the war. \"Rochambeau\" was stricken from the Navy List in 1872 and scrapped in 1874.\n\nOn 11 April 1862, William H. Webb, arguably the premier wooden shipbuilder in the country, sent a model of a large wooden-hulled, casemate ironclad with a displacement of about to the US Navy Department. Webb signed a contract on 3 July with the Navy's Bureau of Yards and Docks for a ship that had an overall length of , a beam of at least and a draft of no more than . His ship was required to make in still water and she was to be armed with four Dahlgren guns in two gun turrets, each protected by of armor, and eight 11-inch Dahlgren guns in a casemate. The ship was to be completed in 15 months at a cost of $1,250,000.\n\n\"Dunderberg\"s contract, as the ship was now named by Webb, was amended on 27 August to specify her armor scheme. Above the main deck, her armor was to be thick. From the main deck to a depth of below the waterline, the armor was to be thick, tapering to at its lower edge. The ship's main and casemate deck armor was thick except at the rear of the ship. The main deck, from the rear of the casemate to the stern, was to consist of 4.5-inch armor plates that tapered to 2.5 inches in thickness. \"Dunderberg\" was to be given a complete double bottom and her engine and boiler rooms were to be completely enclosed by watertight bulkheads. She was also to be provided with two masts and the appropriate rigging.\n\nThe ship was powered by two back-acting steam engines driving one four-bladed propeller feet in diameter, using steam generated by six tubular boilers at a working pressure of . The engines, designed to produce , and boilers were both subcontracted by Webb to the Etna Iron Works of New York City. The engines were originally intended to have a bore of and a stroke of , but Webb increased the bore to to insure that \"Dunderberg\" reached her contract speed. During the ship's first sea trial on 22 February 1867, she reached a speed of about ; during a demonstration for her French buyers on 12 June, \"Dunderberg\" reached . She had two auxiliary boilers to provide steam for the steam engines that powered her pumps, ventilation fans and rotated the gun turrets. These engines, with their bore and stroke of , were larger than the main engines of the s. All of the boilers exhausted through a retractable funnel. The ship normally carried of coal, but could hold a maximum of . She had a light brigantine rig that had a sail area of .\n\nHer keel was laid down before 3 October 1862 at Webb's shipyard in New York City, even though Webb was forced to use unseasoned oak for \"Dunderberg\" because the supply of seasoned timber had been exhausted earlier in the war. Unseasoned wood was far more prone to rot and significantly shortened the ship's life. Her hull was very strongly built with the space between her frames filled with timber and diagonal iron straps tied her frames together. The sides of the casemate at the level of the main deck were approximately thick. Before beginning construction, Webb redesigned the hull, increasing its length to between perpendiculars and its overall length to . Her beam decreased from to and she displaced, at her nominal draft of forward and aft, . These changes made her the longest wooden ship ever built. \"Dunderberg\"s hull was protected from biofouling by two external layers of zinc and copper. The ship was fitted with two rudders, the primary one in the usual location aft of the propeller, but she also had an auxiliary rudder placed in the deadwood above and ahead of the propeller.\n\nMany other changes were made to \"Dunderberg\" while she was under construction and significantly contributed to her delays in completion. The most important of these was the eventual elimination of her turrets which began in October 1863 when Webb wrote to Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, saying that he concurred with the General Superintendent of Ironclads, Rear Admiral Francis Gregory's suggestion that the \"turrets be dispensed with and the casemate lengthened to accommodate an additional number of guns\" Welles did not approve the change until September 1864 when he authorized an armament of four 15-inch and twelve 11-inch guns in the casemate. This was extended by to an approximate overall length of so that it now covered the aft magazine and shell room. It was provided with a total of 22 gun ports, six on each broadside, two on each corner and one each facing the bow and stern. The design of the gun ports was another issue that took years to resolve. They were originally sized for the 11-inch Dahlgren gun with a height of , but this was inadequate to allow the guns to fully elevate as experience with proved. The mounting of the much larger 15-inch Dahlgren gun in the casemate further complicated the design of the gun ports, especially since the design for their carriages was not even finished until May 1866. The design of the gunport itself was revised in the second half of 1865 to reduce the chance of projectiles entering them; the new design was roughly hourglass shaped and narrower in the middle of the casemate than on either the inside or the outside of the gun port. All of these changes to the gun ports delayed the completion of the casemate's woodwork as well as the cutting and installation of the casemate armor. The angle of the casemate was also changed from the original very shallow 35° from the horizontal to an angle of 60° after Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, noted that it would be very difficult to work the guns at such an angle. The deletion of the turrets also required a redesign of the conning tower as Webb had intended to mount it on top of the fore turret. A copy of that used by the monitors was installed between the funnel and the foremast during August 1866.\n\"Dunderberg\" was built with a plough-shaped , ram bow of which the forward were sheathed in cast iron. Her full armament was not installed before she was sold, but gunnery trials were conducted in February 1867 with two 15-inch and four 11-inch guns. With a gun port height of , the 15-inch guns could elevate +8.5° and depress to −5°; equivalent figures for the 11-inch guns were +5° and −7°. The 15-inch guns could traverse 30° forward of the beam and 28° aft and the 11-inch Dahlgrens could bear 28° to both sides. The only significant problem encountered during the trials was that the gun deck was made of soft pine and did not withstand the force of recoil well.\n\nOther problems that delayed the ship's completion were shortages of material, labor and money. Prices for pig iron and bar iron nearly tripled while boiler plate and copper roughly doubled. Wages of even inexperienced workers increased between 50 and 100 percent. The New York City draft riots in July 1863 and several machinist's strikes further slowed progress on \"Dunderberg\". Webb failed to account for these problems when negotiating the ship's contract and he repeatedly tried to charge the Navy for alterations as well as use cheaper materials to reduce his costs. He also attempted to have his contract amended by act of Congress, but he was unsuccessful. The Navy agreed to pay for some of the changes made and it also reduced the reserve amount held back in case the\nship did not meet her specifications in 1865.\n\nBy about 1864, both sides regarded the ship as a white elephant; Welles wrote in his diary that he would rather have the money than the ship and Webb was spending more money than he could anticipate from the contract. Nonetheless, he continued work on the \"Dunderberg\" as he had very little other work for his shipyard and, most importantly, in the hope of getting his contract amended to allow him to make a profit. On 22 July 1865, he launched the ship, now with her hull complete and about half of her armor installed, with much fanfare. The \"New York Times\" estimated a crowd of 20,000 watched the launching. The following year, the government rejected offers by Peru and Chile to purchase the ship, both then at war with Spain, lest the sale prejudice its lawsuit against Great Britain for selling warships to the Confederacy. Webb did manage to get a private bill passed by Congress in March 1867 that allowed him title to the ship once he repaid all monies advanced to him.\n\nAfter Prussia expressed an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. \"Dunderberg\" arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.\n\nThe ship was commissioned and renamed \"Rochambeau\", in honor of the Comte de Rochambeau, a general during the American Revolution, on 7 August. After briefly running machinery trials two days later, Rochambeau began an overhaul in the naval dockyard at Cherbourg to fix problems that had become apparent during her delivery voyage and to modify her in accordance with French practices. These changes included the addition of a pilothouse on top of the conning tower, the replacement of the main rudder and the length of her stern was reduced somewhat. Her armament was removed and replaced by four Canon de 270 Modèle 1864/66 and 10 Canon de 240 Modèle 1864/66 guns, both of which were breech-loading. The 15-caliber guns fired a shell while the 17-caliber guns fired one that weighed . The 270 mm guns were mounted in the corners of the casemate and could pivot between a broadside gun port and one on the corner. Eight of the 240 mm guns were mounted on the broadside and the remaining two were positioned in the bow and stern gun ports. The remaining four gunports, those on the corners closest to the broadside, were plated over.\n\nThe French carefully measured the ship during her 1868 overhaul. At the waterline \"Rochambeau\" was long and had a beam of . She had a mean draft of , a depth of hold of , and displaced . They rated her engines at only , but they produced a maximum of and gave an speed just over 15 knots during her machinery trials in June 1868 after the completion of her overhaul. At normal load she carried of coal and at deep load. In service the ship proved to burn a lot of coal, full bunkers and stored on deck only provided her a range of at a speed of . They reduced her sail area to .\n\nThey measured the ship's armor thickness throughout. The casemate was completely protected by plates. The hull armor extended to a depth of below the waterline and its upper strake was thick while the lower was thick. Her decks were covered by plates and the sides of the conning tower were thick. In service, \"Rochambeau\" proved to be very wet and threw up a lot of spray in a head sea. She had a very quick roll which caused problems when trying to work the guns in heavy weather as even moderate seas could prevent their use altogether since the gun ports were only about above the waterline. Under sail alone in a good breeze, the ship could not maintain her course, could not be steered and would turn until wind and wave were on her beam.\n\"Rochambeau\" completed her refit on 18 May 1868 and was briefly under the command of Captain (\"Capitaine de vaisseau\") Jules-François-Émile Krantz (a future Minister of Marine) before being decommissioned on 1 August and placed in reserve. She was refitted from August to December and had her forward hull armor plates replaced by a one-piece cast iron ram. Still in reserve in 1869, \"Rochambeau\" was modified with an additional 240 mm pivot gun mounted over the forward end of the casemate and the pine planking underneath the guns in the casemate was replaced by oak.\n\nThe ship was recommissioned with a crew of 600 men in mid-July 1870, just before the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War. She departed Cherbourg on 25 August to join the fleet in Danish waters and reached Copenhagen on 31 August. The fleet fruitlessly cruised the Baltic Sea for several weeks before they were ordered home on 16 September. \"Rochambeau\"s shallow draft meant that she and the armored corvette were ordered to search the mouth of the Jade Estuary on 26 September for Prussian ships, but they found nothing.\n\nUpon her return, \"Rochambeau\" was decommissioned again and her crew was ordered to help defend Paris. The ship was stricken from the Navy List (Liste de la Flotte) on 15 April 1872 and was scrapped sometime in 1874.\n\n"}

Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto \"kami\" or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.\n\nConversely foxes were often seen as \"witch animals\", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats).\n\nJapanese fox myths had their origins in Chinese mythology. Chinese folk tales tell of fox spirits called \"húli jīng\" () that may have up to nine tails (\"Kyūbi no Kitsune\" in Japanese). Many of the earliest surviving stories are recorded in the \"Konjaku Monogatarishū\", an 11th-century collection of Chinese, Indian, and Japanese narratives. The nine-tailed foxes came to be adapted as a motif from Chinese mythology to Japanese mythology.\n\nSmyers (1999) notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.\n\nThe full etymology is unknown. The oldest known usage of the word is in the 794 text \"Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki\". Other old sources include Nihon Ryōiki (810–824) and Wamyō Ruijushō (c. 934). These oldest sources are written in Man'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as \"kitune\". Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes \"kitsune\".\n\nMany etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general agreement:\n\n\"Kitsu\" is now archaic; in modern Japanese, a fox's cry is transcribed as \"kon kon\" or \"gon gon\".\n\nOne of the oldest surviving kitsune tales provides a widely known folk etymology of the word \"kitsune\". Unlike most tales of kitsune who become human and marry human males, this one does not end tragically:\n\nBecause the fox returns to her husband each night as a woman but leaves each morning as a fox she is called Kitsune. In classical Japanese, \"kitsu-ne\" means \"come and sleep\", and \"ki-tsune\" means \"always comes\".\n\nKitsune are believed to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of \"yōkai\"; the word \"kitsune\" is often translated as \"fox spirit\". However, this does not mean that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word \"spirit\" is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.\n\nThere are two common classifications of kitsune:\n\n\nLocal traditions add further types. For example, a \"ninko\" is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it possesses them.\nPhysically, kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails. Generally, a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (omniscience). After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a golden color, becoming a , the most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens.\n\nA kitsune may take on human form, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate the appearance of a specific person. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox. \"Kitsune-gao\" or \"fox-faced\" refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.\n\nIn some stories, kitsune have difficulty hiding their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may even be able to see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune can also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.\n\nOne folk story illustrating these imperfections in the kitsune's human shape concerns Koan, a historical person credited with wisdom and magical powers of divination. According to the story, he was staying at the home of one of his devotees when he scalded his foot entering a bath because the water had been drawn too hot. Then, \"in his pain, he ran out of the bathroom naked. When the people of the household saw him, they were astonished to see that Koan had fur covering much of his body, along with a fox's tail. Then Koan transformed in front of them, becoming an elderly fox and running away.\"\n\nOther supernatural abilities commonly attributed to the kitsune include possession, generating fire or lightning, willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as an incredibly tall tree or a second moon in the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.\n\n, also written \"kitsune-tsuki\", literally means \"the state of being possessed by a fox\". The victim is usually a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts. In some cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers.\n\nFolklorist Lafcadio Hearn describes the condition:\nHe goes on to note that, once freed from the possession, the victim will never again be able to eat tofu, \"azukimeshi\", or other foods favored by foxes:\nIn Japan, kitsunetsuki was noted as a disease as early as the Heian period and remained a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.\n\nIn medicine, kitsunetsuki is a culture-bound syndrome unique to Japanese culture. Those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a fox. Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from clinical lycanthropy.\n\nIn folk religion, stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. Those possessed by a fox are thought to suffer from a mental illness-like condition.\n\nThere are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a kuda-gitsune, osaki, yako, and hitogitsune are also called \"kitsunetsuki.\" These families are said to have been able to use their fox to gain fortune, but marriage into such a family was considered forbidden as it would enlarge the family. They are also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of ones that they hate, and as a result of being considered taboo by the other families, it has led to societal problems.\n\nThe great amount of faith given to foxes can be seen in how, as a result of the Inari belief where foxes were believed to be Inari no Kami or its servant, they were employed in practices of dakini-ten by mikkyō practitioners and shugendō practitioners and in the oracles of miko and other practitioners, and the customs related to kitsunetsuki can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.\n\nDepictions of kitsune or their possessed victims may feature round white balls known as . Tales describe these as glowing with kitsunebi. Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls. When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail. Jewels are a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.\n\nOne belief is that when a \"kitsune\" changes shape, its \"hoshi no tama\" holds a portion of its magical power. Another tradition is that the pearl represents the kitsune's soul; the kitsune will die if separated from it for long. Those who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the \"kitsune\" to help them in exchange for its return. For example, a 12th-century tale describes a man using a fox's \"hoshi no tama\" to secure a favor:\n\n\"Confound you!\" snapped the fox. \"Give me back my ball!\" The man ignored its pleas till finally it said tearfully, \"All right, you've got the ball, but you don't know how to keep it. It won't be any good to you. For me, it's a terrible loss. I tell you, if you don't give it back, I'll be your enemy forever. If you \"do\" give it back though, I'll stick to you like a protector god.\"\n\nThe fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers.\n\nEmbedded in Japanese folklore as they are, kitsune appear in numerous Japanese works. Noh, kyogen, bunraku, and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature them, as do contemporary works such as anime, manga and video games. Japanese metal idol band Babymetal refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks, hand signs, and animation interludes during live shows. Western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends.\n\nKitsune are associated with Inari, the Shinto deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave offerings. Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called \"aburage\", which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune udon and kitsune soba. Similarly, \"Inari-zushi\" is a type of sushi named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as \"kami\".\n\nInari's kitsune are white, a color of good omen. They possess the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome \"nogitsune\", those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.\n\nAccording to beliefs derived from \"fusui\" (\"feng shui\"), the fox's power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil \"kimon\", or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them.\n\nKitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the Dakiniten, goddesses conflated with Inari's female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a female boddhisattva wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox.\n\nKitsune are often presented as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune are thought to employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray in the manner of a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.\n\nA traditional game called \"kitsune-ken\" (\"fox-fist\") references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game is similar to rock, paper, scissors, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.\n\nThis ambiguous portrayal, coupled with their reputation for vengefulness, leads people to try to discover a troublesome fox's motives. In one case, the 16th-century leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi wrote a letter to the \"kami\" Inari:\n\nKitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a kitsune attaches itself to a person or household, where they can cause all sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner's threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch appears in the man's dreams:\nOther kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect. As \"yōkai\", however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion. Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered \"zenko\" and the use of their magic a sign of prestige. Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune. One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house \"has been ours for many years, and ... we wish to register a vigorous protest.\" The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.\n\nTales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money or material wealth, part or all of the sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless items under a magical illusion. True kitsune gifts are usually intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.\n\nKitsune are commonly portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune who takes the form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.\n\nMany stories tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, they possess special physical or supernatural qualities that often pass to their own children. The astrologer-magician Abe no Seimei was reputed to have inherited such extraordinary powers.\n\nOther stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain falling from a clear sky — a sunshower — is called \"kitsune no yomeiri\" or \"the kitsune's wedding\", in reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions. The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 Akira Kurosawa film \"Dreams\".\n\nStephen Turnbull, in \"Nagashino 1575\", relates the tale of the Takeda clan's involvement with a fox-woman. The warlord Takeda Shingen, in 1544, defeated in battle a lesser local warlord named Suwa Yorishige and drove him to suicide after a \"humiliating and spurious\" peace conference, after which Shingen forced marriage on Suwa Yorishige's beautiful 14-year-old daughter Lady Koi—Shingen's own niece. Shingen, Turnbull writes, \"was so obsessed with the girl that his superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of the white fox-spirit of the Suwa Shrine, who had bewitched him in order to gain revenge.\" When their son Takeda Katsuyori proved to be a disastrous leader and led the clan to their devastating defeat at the battle of Nagashino, Turnbull writes, \"wise old heads nodded, remembering the unhappy circumstances of his birth and his magical mother\".\n\n\n"}

The \"Pall Mall Gazette\" reported in 1892 that \"the Kilburn Sisters ... daily satisfied hundreds of dockers with soup and Spotted Dick\".. The name \"spotted dog\" first appears in 1854, in C.M.

{"id": "238893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238893", "title": "Marbleizing", "text": "Marbleizing\n\nMarbleizing or faux marbling is the preparation and finishing of a surface to imitate the appearance of polished marble. It is typically used in buildings where the cost or weight of genuine marble would be prohibitive. Faux marbling is a special case of faux painting used to create the distinctive and varied patterns of marble - the most imitated stone by far.\n\nFaux stone painting was widely used in Pompeii, but it really took off in Europe during the Renaissance with two schools of faux painting developing. The Italian school was loose and artistic, the French school was formal and realistic. It typically took an apprentice 10 years or more to fully master the art.\n\nThe sophistication of the techniques are such that visitors are frequently unable to distinguish between false and real marble in many churches, palaces and public buildings in Europe. The techniques were perfected by the 17th century and have been used in all styles of construction well into the 20th century, including Baroque, palladian, neoclassical and historical revival styles as well as Art Nouveau and Art Deco buildings. Craftsmen who are able to replicate this work are still available, as evidenced, for example, by the extensive restorations of faux marble surfaces in important Eastern Europe buildings since 1990.\n\nThe art of marbling and graining reached its apogee in Britain between 1845 and 1870, and during this period the acknowledged master was Thomas Kershaw.\n\nKershaw was born in Standish, Lancashire England in April 1819. At the age of 12 he was apprenticed to Mr. John Platt of Bolton who was paid the sum of £23 by Kershaw’s father in order that his son could be instructed in the craft of house painting. He worked 10 hours a day for six days a week. He completed his apprenticeship at the age of 21.\nHe achieved international fame, winning a number of the most prestigious awards at the major exhibitions of the age; The Great Exhibition, London, 1851 - a first prize medal; Exposition Universelle, Paris, 1855 - a first class medal; London Exhibition, 1862 - first prize.\n\nKershaw's work was so good that it was often considered to be indiscernible from the original. He undertook work in many large houses, mansions and stately homes throughout England and Wales and once declined an offer from the Russian Ambassador to imitate marbles on the interior of the Imperial Palace in St Petersburg. In 1858 he produced one of his important works in the Blue Room in Buckingham Palace where all the pillars were done in imitation marble.\n\nIn modern times, William Holgate (1931-2002) from Clitheroe, Lancashire, was possibly the finest grainer and marbler in the world since Thomas Kershaw held the title 150 years before. His achievements include the prestigious award known as the \"Freedom of the City and Guilds of London\" and he was very proud to be made \"A Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter Stainers of Trinity Lane, London,\" on March 14, 1995. He was also given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2001 Paris Salon. His apprentice and protégé, Andrew Johnstone continues his tradition.\n\nOther techniques for producing faux marble include Scagliola, a costly process which involves the use of specially pigmented plasters, and terrazzo. For flooring, marble chips are imbedded in cement, then ground and polished to expose the marble aggregate.\n\nSome professional faux finishers are very skilled and will use a variety of techniques to reproduce the colors, veining and luster of real marble or other building materials. However, many decorators will merely suggest the appearance of marble rather than accurately imitate a particular stone.\n\n"}

(The word \"adverbial\" itself is also used as an adjective, meaning \"having the same function as an adverb\".) Look at the examples below:\n\nIn English, adverbials most commonly take the form of adverbs, adverb phrases, temporal noun phrases or prepositional phrases. Many types of adverbials (for instance: reason and condition) are often expressed by clauses.\nAn adverbial is a construction which modifies or describes verbs. When an adverbial modifies a verb, it changes the meaning of that verb. Word groups, which are also considered to be adverbials, can also modify verbs: for example, a prepositional phrase, a noun phrase, a finite clause or a non-finite clause. Prepositional phrase in a sentence may be adverbial; that is, it modifies a verb.\n\nAdverbials are typically divided into four classes:\n\nAdverbial complements (i.e. obligatory adverbial) are adverbials that render a sentence ungrammatical and meaningless if removed.\n\nAdjuncts: These are part of the core meaning of the sentence, but if omitted still leave a meaningful sentence.\n\nConjuncts: These link two sentences together.\n\nDisjuncts: These make comments on the meaning of the rest of the sentence.\n\nAll verb- or sentence-modifying adjuncts are adverbials, but some adverbials are not adjuncts.\n\n\nPrepositions (\"in\", \"out\", etc.) may be used adverbially to indicate direction or location.\n\n\nIn some models of grammar negators such as \"not\" and \"never\" are considered adverbs and their function that of negating adverbial.\n\nOften ignored, expletives may take up many adverbial syntactic functions.

The latter chemical is also variously labeled as para-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, pDCB, or PDB, making it harder to identify unless all these synonyms are known to a potential purchaser. Both of these formulations have the strong, pungent, sickly-sweet odor often associated with mothballs. Both naphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene undergo sublimation, meaning that they evaporate from a solid state directly into a gas; this gas is toxic to moths and moth larvae.\n\nNaphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene should not be used together because the mixture may cause damage to items being preserved.\n\nDue to the health risks of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and flammability of naphthalene, other substances like camphor are sometimes used.\n\nMothballs are stored in air-tight bags made of a non-reactive plastic such as polyethylene or polypropylene (other plastics may cause a reaction). The clothing protected by their presence must also be enclosed in one of these plastics and must be sealed within it. Otherwise the vapors will tend to escape and will lose the effectiveness. Manufacturer's instructions regularly warn against using mothballs for any purpose other than those specified by the packaging, as such uses are not only harmful and noxious, they are also frequently considered illegal.\n\nAlthough occasionally used as snake repellent, mothballs are not effective for this purpose. Use as a rodent, squirrel, and bat repellent is also largely ineffective, is illegal in many areas, and tends to cause more annoyance to humans than to the target pest. Mothballs, however, continue to be advertised as squirrel repellent and are an ingredient in some commercial vermin and snake repellent products. Evidence of their effectiveness as a squirrel repellent is lacking.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that 1,4-dichlorobenzene \"may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen\". This has been indicated by animal studies, although a full-scale human study has not been done. The National Toxicology Program (NTP), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the state of California consider 1,4-dichlorobenzene a carcinogen.\n\nExposure to naphthalene mothballs can cause acute hemolysis (anemia) in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. IARC classifies naphthalene as possibly carcinogenic to humans and other animals (see also Group 2B). IARC points out that acute exposure causes cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits, and mice. Chronic exposure to naphthalene vapors is reported to also cause cataracts and retinal hemorrhage. Under California's Proposition 65, naphthalene is listed as \"known to the State to cause cancer\".\n\nResearch at the University of Colorado at Boulder revealed a probable mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of mothballs and some types of air fresheners.\n\n1,4-Dichlorobenzene is a neurotoxin. It has been abused as an inhalant, causing a variety of neurotoxic effects.\n\nMothballs containing naphthalene have been banned within the EU since 2008.\n\nAs discussed in more detail at \"Tineola bisselliella\", alternatives to mothballs to control clothes moths include dry cleaning, freezing, thorough vacuuming, or washing in hot water. Camphor is also used as a moth repellent, particularly in China. Unlike naphthalene and dichlorobenzene, camphor has medicinal applications and is not regarded as a carcinogen, though it is toxic in large doses.\n\nPheromone traps are also an effective tool used when attempting to protect valuable clothing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "241554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241554", "title": "Milkshake", "text": "Milkshake\n\nA milkshake is a sweet, cold beverage that is usually made from milk, ice cream, or iced milk, and flavorings or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, or fruit syrup. Many more precise and rigid definitions are used, subject to region. Outside of the United States, milkshakes using ice cream or iced milk are sometimes called a thick milkshake or thick shake; in New England, the term frappe may be used to differentiate it from thinner forms of flavored milk, with the term for a coffee ice cream/coffee syrup and milk-based beverage combination receiving the name coffee cabinet in Rhode Island. The term \"shake\" may be used more generally to refer to any cold beverage involving milk. Many food places such as McDonald’s avoid the term \"milkshake\" on their menus in favor of the term \"shake\".\n\nFull-service restaurants, soda fountains, and diners usually prepare and mix the shake \"by hand\" from scoops of ice cream and milk in a blender or drink mixer using a stainless steel cup. Many fast food outlets do not make shakes by hand with ice cream; instead, they make shakes in automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. However, some fast food outlets still follow the traditional method, and some serve milkshakes which are prepared by blending soft-serve ice cream (or ice milk) with flavoring or syrups. Milkshakes can also be made at home with a blender or automatic drink mixer.\n\nA milkshake can also be made by adding powder into fresh milk and stirring the powder into the milk. Milkshakes made in this way can come in a variety of flavors, including chocolate, caramel, strawberry, and banana.\n\nHand-blended milkshakes are traditionally made from any flavor of ice cream; additional flavorings, such as chocolate syrup and/or malt syrup or malt powder, can be added prior to mixing. This allows a greater variety than is available in machine-made shakes. Some unusual milkshake recipes exclude ice cream.\n\nMilkshake-like recipes which use a high proportion of fruit and no ice cream are usually called smoothies, even if frozen yogurt (a dairy dessert) is used; however there are cases where a blended beverage is made with sherbet, frozen yogurt and fruit which are sold as smoothies even though they could also be considered milkshakes. When malted milk is added, a milkshake is called a malted milkshake, a malt shake (or maltshake), a malted, or simply a malt. An ice cream-based milkshake may be called a \"thick milkshake\" or \"thick shake\" in the United Kingdom or a \"frappe\" ( ) or \"frap\" in parts of New England and Canada.\n\nSome U.S. restaurants serve milkshakes with crumbled cookies, candy bar pieces, or alcoholic beverages.\n\nPre-made milkshakes are sold in grocery stores in North America and the UK. These drinks are made from milk mixed with sweetened flavored powder, artificial syrup, or concentrate, which would otherwise be called \"flavored milk\", thickened with carrageenan or other products. Bottled milkshakes are usually sold in 330ml, 500ml, or 1 liter bottles.\n\nWhen the term \"milkshake\" was first used in print in 1885, milkshakes were an alcoholic whiskey drink that has been described as a \"sturdy, healthful eggnog type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat\". However, by 1900, the term referred to \"wholesome drinks made with chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla syrups.\" By the \"early 1900s people were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream.\" By the 1930s, milkshakes were a popular drink at malt shops, which were the \"typical soda fountain of the period ... used by students as a meeting place or hangout.\"\n\nThe history of the electric blender, malted milk drinks, and milkshakes are interconnected. Before the widespread availability of electric blenders, milkshake-type drinks were more like eggnog, or they were a hand-shaken mixture of crushed ice and milk, sugar, and flavorings. Hamilton Beach's drink mixers began being used at soda fountains in 1911 and the electric blender or drink mixer was invented by Steven Poplawski in 1922. With the invention of the blender, milkshakes began to take their modern, whipped, aerated, and frothy form.\n\nThe use of malted milk powder in milkshakes was popularized in the USA by the Chicago drugstore chain Walgreens. Malted milk powder—a mixture of evaporated milk, malted barley, and wheat flour—had been invented by William Horlick in 1897 for use as an easily digested restorative health drink for disabled people and children, and as an infant's food. However, healthy people soon began drinking beverages made with malted milk simply for the taste, and malted milk beverages containing milk, chocolate syrup, and malt powder became a standard offering at soda fountains. In 1922, Walgreens employee Ivar \"Pop\" Coulson made a milkshake by adding two scoops of vanilla ice cream to the standard malted milk drink recipe. This item, under the name \"Horlick's Malted Milk\", was featured by the Walgreen drugstore chain as part of a chocolate milk shake, which itself became known as a \"malted\" or \"malt\" and became one of the most popular soda-fountain drinks.\n\nThe automation of milkshakes developed in the 1930s, after the invention of freon-cooled refrigerators provided a safe, reliable way of automatically making and dispensing ice cream. In 1936, inventor Earl Prince used the basic concept behind the freon-cooled automated ice cream machine to develop the Multimixer, a \"five-spindled mixer that could produce five milkshakes at once, all automatically, and dispense them at the pull of a lever into awaiting paper cups.\" \n\nIn the late 1930s, several newspaper articles show that the term \"frosted\" was used to refer to milkshakes made with ice cream. In 1937, the \"Denton Journal\" in Maryland stated that \"For a 'frosted' shake, add a dash of your favorite ice cream.\" In 1939, the \"Mansfield News\" in Ohio stated that \"A frosted beverage, in the vernacular, is something good to which ice cream has been added. Example par excellence is frosted coffee—that hot, tasty beverage made chilly with ice and frosty with ice cream.\"\n\nBy the 1950s, popular places to drink milkshakes were Woolworth's \"5 & 10\" lunch counters, diners, burger joints, and drugstore soda fountains. These establishments often prominently displayed a shining chrome or stainless steel milkshake mixing machine.\n\nThese establishments made milkshakes in Hamilton Beach or similar styles of drink mixers, which had spindles and agitators that folded air into the drinks for \"smooth, fluffy results\" and served them in 12½-ounce tall, \"Y\"-shaped glasses. Soda fountain staff had their own jargon, such as \"Burn One All the Way\" (chocolate malted with chocolate ice cream), \"Twist It, Choke It, and Make It Cackle\" (chocolate malted with an egg), \"Shake One in the Hay\" (a strawberry shake), and a \"White Cow\" (a vanilla milkshake). In the 1950s, a milkshake machine salesman named Ray Kroc bought exclusive rights to the 1930s-era Multimixer milkshake maker from inventor Earl Prince, and went on to use automated milkshake machines to speed up production at McDonald's restaurants.\n\nMilkshakes had also become popular in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In Australia, milk bars had grown popular and milkshakes were normally served lightly whipped and often in the aluminium or stainless steel cups in which they were prepared. In addition to more conventional flavors, spearmint and lime flavored milkshakes became popular in Australia.\n\nIn the 1950s, milkshakes were called \"frappes\", \"velvets\", \"frosted [drinks]\", or \"cabinets\" in different parts of the U.S. A specialty style of milkshake, the \"concrete\", was \"a milk shake so thick that the server hands it out the order window upside down, demonstrating that not a drop will drip.\" In 1952, the \"Newport Daily News\" in Rhode Island contained a \"Guide For Top Quality ICE CREAM SODAS CABINETS MILK SHAKES\", which shows the use of the term \"cabinet\" in print. An article from 1953 in the \"Salisbury Times\" (in the state of Maryland) suggests that shakes can be made in a jar by shaking well. The article states that by adding four large tablespoons of ice cream, the drink becomes a \"frosted shake\". Currently, in New England, and especially the Greater Boston area, the ice-cream and milk dessert known as a \"milkshake\" in other parts of the country is referred to as a \"frappe\". In these locales, \"milkshake\" refers to a lighter drink, usually made of shaken or blended milk with flavoring of some sort. A milkshake may be abbreviated as \"shake\" in some restaurants.\n\nIn 2005, the traditional home of the milkshake, the family restaurants and 24-hour diner-style restaurants that were the \"staples of 1950s and 60s America such as Denny's, Big Boy, and the International House of Pancakes\" were supplanted \"in terms of revenue for the first time since the U.S. census started measuring this in the 1970s. The shift means the burger, fries, and milkshake ideal evoked by the sitcom \"Happy Days\" is losing its hold on the American appetite.\" Instead, U.S. consumers are going out to casual dining restaurants.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Agricultural Research Service developed reduced-sugar, low-fat milk shakes for lunch programs. The shakes have half the sugar and only 10% of the fat of commercial fast-food shakes. Schools need a milk shake machine or soft-serve ice cream machine to serve the milkshakes. The milkshakes also have added fiber and other nutrients, and they have much less lactose, which makes the shakes appropriate for some lactose intolerant people.\n\nThe U.S. sales of milkshakes, malts, and floats rose 11% in 2006, according to the industry research firm NPD Group. Christopher Muller, the director of the Center for Multi-Unit Restaurant Management at Orlando's University of Central Florida states that \"milkshakes remind us of summer, youth — and indulgence\", and \"they're evocative of a time gone by\".\nMuller states that milkshakes are an \"enormously profitable\" item for restaurants, since the fluffy drinks contain so much air. The market research firm Technomic states that about 75% of the average-priced $3.38 restaurant shake in 2006 was profit. An executive from Sonic Drive-In, a U.S. chain of 1950s-style diner restaurants, calls shakes \"one of our highest-volume, revenue-producing areas\".\n\nPart of the increase in milkshake sales reported in 2006 may be due to the increasing availability of innovative chef-designed milkshakes in high-end restaurants. In 2006, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that chefs from \"hipster hangouts and retro landmarks\" are using \"macerated farmers market strawberries, Valrhona chocolate, and Madagascar Bourbon vanilla\" to make new milkshake flavors.\n\nOther novel ideas offered in LA-area restaurants include milkshakes made with toasted pecans, saffron-rose water or orange-blossom ice cream, taro root, vanilla beans steeped in rum, Valrhona chocolate and Grey Goose vodka, and vanilla custard mixed with Russian Imperial stout.\n\nA 2016 article stated that chefs are trying out innovative ideas with milkshakes to keep customers interested in the frothy drinks. The article noted that coffee-flavored shakes are popular \"because it [coffee flavour] complements both sweet and savory\" dishes. At One Market Restaurant, gay pride was celebrated with a Harvey Milk shake (intended for adults, due to its alcohol content), named after the ground-breaking gay US politician. The shake included \"vanilla ice cream, Pinnacle Peach Vodka, Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur, strawberries, blueberries and Valrhona White Chocolate Pride Tuile.\" Other bars are also adding alcoholic beverages to shakes for adults, such as \"spirits and/or beer, though these can be very challenging to pull off without dairy curdling.” Unusual flavours from 2016 included bacon (particularly popular amongst millennials), peanut butter and jelly (like the popular sandwich), pumpkin, chocolate-coated strawberry and red velvet (like the cake). Another trend is using different types of milk, such as \"almond milk, coconut milk, [or] hemp milk.\"\n\nAn unusual trend from 2016 was the Black Tap milkshake, a premium-priced ($15), 1,600 calorie drink that includes a \"mountain of ice cream topped with peanut butter cups, lollipops, cotton candy, or even entire slices of cake\". Similar drinks referred to as \"freakshakes\" were popular in the United Kingdom and Australia around this time. A 2018 article described a date shake made with ice milk and a concentrated form of dates called \"date crystals\"; the milkshake, sold in Palm Springs, California, was described by the reviewer as \"[e]arthy and sweet\", with tastes of \"butterscotch, caramel and even chocolate\", with \"surprisingly complex flavors\".\n\n\"The Longest Drink in Town\" is a popular drink cup in New Zealand with a branded logo of a giraffe that is used for milkshakes throughout the country, most commonly in dairies. The cup was introduced in 1968; it has a logo is composed of a giraffe on a cup or shirt, with text reading \"The Longest Drink in Town\" next to it. The phrase, \"The Longest Drink in Town\", compares the height of the milkshake cup to that of a giraffe. In 2011, Delmaine introduced a brand of milkshake syrups under the brand name The Longest Drink in Town. Master Shake, one of the main characters from the long-running American animated television series \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" (also known by various alternative titles), is a life-sized anthropomorphic milkshake. In the ultraviolent futuristic dystopia in \"A Clockwork Orange\" by director Stanley Kubrick, the young gang members go to the Korova milk bar for \"milk plus\", a dairy beverage to which stimulants and hallucinogenic drugs have been added.\n\n\"Milkshakes in the movies are shorthand for sweetness and goodness.\" In \"All About Eve\", by director Joseph L Mankiewicz, Bette Davis’ character is unhappy to see a man she likes chatting up her young female assistant, so Davis' character orders an alcoholic Martini, and \"then mockingly suggests [that] Eve [the young assistant] will have a milkshake\", thereby \"asserting womanhood over girlhood through milkshake's associations with virginity.\" Similarly, the socially awkward and nerdy character Steve Buscemi plays in \"Ghost World\" is made fun of by a teenage girl because he orders a \"virginal vanilla milkshake\"; in \"Manhattan\", by director Woody Allen, the director draws attention to the difference in age between his 42-year-old character (he also acts in the lead role) and his teenage girlfriend by having her drink a milkshake. In the film \"Lolita\" in 1997, a teenage girl drinks a milkshake while she is with the middle-aged man (her mother's new boyfriend) who is attracted to her. Pulp Fiction has a scene in a retro-50s diner where two characters on a first date discuss the merits of a \"Five Dollar Milkshake\" (\"Martin and Lewis\" for vanilla, \"Amos and Andy\" for chocolate). \n\nThe TV series \"Riverdale\" depicts the characters in a 1950s-inspired \"local diner, Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe, where they favor the greasy, calorie-laden stuff of American folklore: burgers, fries, and milkshakes\"; to promote the show, the cast \"...shared a milkshake on a Jimmy Fallon [talk show] segment in reference to their characters’ heroic consumption of thick malts.\"\n\n\"Milkshake\" is the title of a 2003 R&B–electro song written and produced by The Neptunes for American singer Kelis' third studio album, \"Tasty\". It reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands, and became Kelis' biggest success to date on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the United States, peaking at number three. The song became an Internet meme following the release of Paul Thomas Anderson's 2007 film \"There Will Be Blood\", in which scenes from the film (most notably from its famous \"I drink your milkshake\" scene) were edited to the song. The line became something of a catchphrase for the film and gained moderate recognition in popular culture following the film's release. \n\nIn 2017, \"The Guardian\" described the slang term \"milkshake duck\", which refers to the social media \"...arc, where the internet rushes en masse to embrace something or someone as cute, worthy, fun or funny\" (such as a duck that drinks milkshakes), but \"then just as quickly drops it, when it’s revealed to somehow be unpleasantly complicated\"; the paper called the term \"useful shorthand\" for when a \"favourite [concept] is revealed to be problematic\". In 2017, there was also a trend of posting photos of milkshakes online; the \"hashtag #freakshakes\" was used for \"more than 89,000 posts on Instagram.\" Photographer Alana Dimou made fun of the trend of topping milkshakes with donuts \"perched upon mason jars, [and] Kit-Kats wedged like an unholy crucifix\", with \"each establishment attempting to outdo the last, to outplay the originals who rightly hold the claim to fame\"; her parody photos show milkshakes topped with tall stacks of donuts or burgers.\n\n"}
{"id": "241559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241559", "title": "Oreo", "text": "Oreo\n\nOreo () is a brand of cookie usually consisting of two chocolate wafers with a sweet crème filling, marketed as \"Chocolate Sandwich Cookie\". Introduced in 1912, Oreo is the bestselling cookie in the United States. As of 2018, the version sold in the U.S. is made by the Nabisco division of Mondelez International.\n\nOreos are available in over one hundred different countries; in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, they are referred to as \"Oreo biscuits\". Many different varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited edition runs have become popular in the 21st century.\n\nThe origin of the name Oreo is unknown, but there are many hypotheses, including derivations from the French word \"or\", meaning gold, or the Greek word ωραίο (/ɔ.ˈrɛ.ɔ/), meaning tasty, beautiful, nice or well done. Others believe that the cookie was named Oreo simply because the name was short and easy to pronounce. Another theory is that the name derives from the Latin \"Oreodaphne\", a genus of the laurel family. Food writer Stella Parks notes in her book \"BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts\" that the original design of the Oreo includes a laurel wreath; and the names of several of Nabisco's cookies at the time of the original Oreo had botanical derivations, including Avena, Lotus, and Helicon (from \"Heliconia\").\n\nThe \"Oreo Biscuit\" was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912 at its Chelsea, Manhattan factory in the current-day Chelsea Market complex, located on Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. Today, this same block of Ninth Avenue is known as \"Oreo Way\". The name Oreo was first trademarked on March 14, 1912. It was launched as an imitation of the Hydrox cookie manufactured by Sunshine company, which was introduced in 1908.\n\nThe original design on the face of the Oreo featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name \"OREO\" in the center. In the United States, they were sold for 25 cents a pound (453 g) in novelty metal canisters with clear glass tops. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nThe Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to \"Oreo Sandwich\"; in 1948, the name was changed to \"Oreo Crème Sandwich\"; and in 1974 it became the \"Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie\", the name that has remained to this day. A new design for the face of the cookie was launched in 1924; the modern-day Oreo design was developed in 1952 by William A. Turnier, incorporating the Nabisco logo. In 1920, a second lemon crème-filled variety of the Oreo was introduced, as an alternative to the white crème-filled variety, but this was discontinued in 1924 and the original flavor was the only version available for the next several decades.\n\nThe modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello, who retired from Nabisco in 1993. Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo; he also created a range of Oreo cookies that were covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate. In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the crème filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Oreo cookies are popular with people that have certain dietary restrictions, such as vegans, as the crème filling does not use any animal products. However, there is still a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas..\n\nFrom January 2006, Nabisco replaced the trans fat in the Oreo cookie with non-hydrogenated vegetable oil.\n\nNabisco began a marketing campaign in 2008, advertising the use of Oreo cookies in an online game called DSRL (which stands for \"Double Stuf Racing League\"), introduced the week before Super Bowl XLII. DSRL had been endorsed by football brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning; the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, also joined, challenging the Mannings to a race that was aired in an advertisement on January 18, 2009. Another campaign was launched for \"Golden Double Stuf Oreo\" cookies, in which the Manning brothers were challenged by Donald Trump and a character called \"Double Trump\", played by Darrell Hammond; this competition aired on January 24, 2010. The Mannings won both races. Another advertisement featured a \"Hooded Menace\" threatening to take over the DSRL, with Eli Manning and Stufy (the DSRL mascot) needing some help, which aired on September 14, 2010. Six days later, it was announced that Shaquille O'Neal and Apolo Ohno had joined Oreo's DSRL veterans Eli Manning and Venus Williams.\n\nIn April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue crème to promote the 2011 3D computer animated film \"Rio\". The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two contests were also announced: by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; and prize stickers could be found in winning packages, including a trip to Rio de Janeiro, backpacks, cinema passes for a year, and 3D glasses. The promotion was available in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia, and ended on May 30, 2011.\n\nIn June 2012, Oreo posted an advertisement displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow colored crème to celebrate Gay Pride month; the cookie itself was fictional and was not being manufactured or made available for sale. The advertisement prompted some negative comments, but Kraft stood by their promotion, stating that \"Kraft Foods has a proud history of celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. We feel the Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values.\" This was followed during 2012 by a series of adverts commemorating other holidays and events, including a blue, white, and red crème Oreo to honor Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs marking the appearance of the Delta Aquariids meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it to promote Shark Week on The Discovery Channel.\nOreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the \"World's Best Selling Cookie\". In March 2012, \"Time\" magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 different countries. Overall, it is estimated that since the Oreo cookie's inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos have been produced worldwide. \n\n\"Oreo biscuits\" (as they are known in the United Kingdom) were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain Sainsbury's. This was the only store that stocked the Oreo in the UK for several years, until May 2008 when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. It was repackaged in the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a £4.5M television advertising campaign based around the \"twist, lick, dunk\" catchphrase.\n\nIn the UK, Kraft partnered with McDonald's to introduce the Oreo McFlurry (which was already on sale in several other countries) into a number of McDonald's locations during its annual \"Great Tastes of America\" promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry became a permanent menu item at McDonald's in the UK. An Oreo flavored \"Krushem\" drink was also on sale in KFC stores across Britain.\n\nThe ingredients of the British Oreo biscuit (as listed on the UK Oreo website) are slightly different from those of the US Oreo cookie. Unlike the US version, the British Oreo originally contained whey powder, so was not suitable for people with lactose intolerance. Additionally, as the whey powder was sourced from cheese made with calf rennet, the British version was also unsuitable for vegetarians. On December 6, 2011, Kraft announced that production of Oreo biscuits was to start in the UK – their Cadbury factory in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was selected to manufacture Oreo biscuits in Britain for the first time and production began there in May 2013.\n\nOreo cookies were introduced onto the Indian market by Cadbury India in 2011. The biscuit industry in India is estimated to be worth around 1.8 billion dollars.\n\nIn Pakistan, Oreo is manufactured and sold by Lefèvre-Utile, also known as LU.\n\nAccording to a statement from Kim McMiller, an Associate Director of Consumer Relations, a two-stage process is used to produce Oreo cookies. The base cake dough is formed into the familiar round cookies by a rotary mold at the entrance of a oven.\n\nMost of the Oreo production was once carried out at the Hershey's factory in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Oreo cookies for the Asian markets are manufactured in India, Indonesia, and China, with the exception of the Japanese market where they are manufactured locally under the brand \"Yamazaki-Nabisco\". Oreo cookies for the European market are made in Spain; they are made in Russia (Mondelēz Rus) for consumers in several CIS countries; and those sold in Australia are manufactured in Indonesia (previously China) or Spain, depending on the flavor. The version produced in Canada (sold under the Christie's brand) includes coconut oil and is sold exclusively in that region. Manufacture of Oreo biscuits began in Pakistan in early 2014, in collaboration with Mondelēz International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited (CBL) of Pakistan, at the CBL production plant in Sukkur.\n\nIn 2015, Mondelēz announced its decision to close some of its American factories and move Oreo production to Mexico, prompting the Oreo boycott. In 2016, after production had started in Mexico, the AFL-CIO encouraged the boycott and published consumer guidance to help identify which Mondelēz products were made in Mexico.\n\nIn July 2016, Oreo cookies ceased production in Chicago.\n\nThe ingredients of Oreo cookies have remained largely unchanged from the original, although numerous alternative varieties and flavors have emerged over time. The classic Oreo cookie is made using eleven main ingredients:\n\n\nOne six-pack of Oreos contains 270 calories, hence there are 45 calories in one cookie. Of these 45 calories, 27 come from carbohydrates, 16.5 come from fat, and only 1.5 calories are provided by protein.\n\nDifferent Oreo flavors have varying amounts of carbohydrate: the chocolate fudge Oreo contains 13g of total carbohydrates (4% of the recommended daily intake) and 9g of sugars per serving of 3 cookies, while mint Oreos contain 25g of total carbohydrates and 18g of sugars per serving. Vitamins, minerals and proteins are found in small amounts, however Oreos do not contain any vitamin A or vitamin C.\n\nIn addition to their traditional design of two chocolate wafers separated by a crème filling, Oreo cookies have been produced in a multitude of different varieties since they were first introduced. This list is only a guide to some of the more notable and popular types; not all are available in every country. The main varieties in the United States are:\n\n\nSpecial edition \"Double Stuf Oreo\" cookies are produced during springtime, and around Halloween and Christmas. These have colored frosting reflecting the current holiday: blue or yellow for springtime; orange for Halloween; and red or green for the Christmas holiday. One side of each seasonal cookie is stamped with an appropriate design; the spring cookies feature flowers, butterflies, etc., while the Halloween editions feature a jack o'lantern, ghost, cat, flock of bats, or broom-riding witch. The 2017 \"Halloween Oreo\" broke with this tradition, having orange-colored crème filling (albeit with classic vanilla flavor) but carrying no seasonal designs.\n\nIn some countries, Oreos come in a variety of flavors that are not familiar to the U.S. market. For example, \"Green Tea Oreos\" are only available in China and Japan, while \"Lemon Ice Oreos\" were only ever introduced in Japan.\n\nBeginning in the early 2010s, Oreo began releasing limited edition runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These \"limited editions\" typically appear in stores for a short period and are then discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: \"Reese's Oreos\" returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and \"Birthday Cake Oreos\", originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available. Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.\n\nLimited edition runs usually feature a crème filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as lemon or mint, to the more specific and unusual flavors of blueberry pie or red velvet cake. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example \"Cinnamon-Bun Oreos\" featured cinnamon flavored cookies and \"frosting flavored crème\". In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable confectionery brands, including Reese's, Swedish Fish, and Peeps.\n\nSome examples of limited edition Oreos are:\n\n\nCinema and television drama frequently features characters who have an obsession, or at least an interest, in Oreos. For example:\n\nThe term \"Oreo\" has been used as a derogatory reference to a black person who is perceived or judged to act in a \"white manner.\" The racial slur may be levied as an accusation that the person perpetuates the \"un-level playing field for blacks\". The metaphor is based on the implication that the person is fundamentally like the cookie, \"black on the outside and white on the inside\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "243972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243972", "title": "Partitive", "text": "Partitive\n\nIn linguistics, the partitive is a word, phrase, or case that indicates partialness. Nominal partitives are syntactic constructions, such as \"some of the children\", and may be classified semantically as either set partitives or entity partitives based on the quantifier and the type of embedded noun used. Partitives should not be confused with \"quantitatives\" (also known as pseudopartitives), which often look similar in form, but behave differently syntactically and have a distinct meaning.\n\nIn many Romance and Germanic languages, nominal partitives usually take the form: \n\n[ Det. + \"of\" + [ Det. + NP]]\n\nwhere the first determiner is a quantifier word, using a prepositional element to link it to the larger set or whole from which that quantity is partitioned. The partitive constructions of the following languages all have the same translation, with a very similar form:\n\nSome languages, for example Estonian and Finnish, have a special partitive case. In Latin, German and Russian, the partitive is expressed by the genitive case, sometimes called the partitive genitive.\n\nPartitives can be distinguished semantically based on whether they involve a part of a whole, called \"entity partitives\", or a subset of a larger set, called \"set partitives\". The embedded NPs in entity partitives denote either entities at the individual level, such as \"a cookie\" or entities at the group level, such as \"Bob and Sue\". Some phrases such as ‘the linguists’ can be interpreted as either a group level entity and thus participate in an entity partitive – \"half of the linguists\"; alternatively, it can be interpreted as a set of entities, and thus participate in a set partitive – \"one of the linguists\".\n\nGiven the following syntactic structure of partitives, \"[DP Det. + of + [DP Det. + NP]]\", the first determiner is a quantifier word which quantifies over a subset or part of the embedded DP, which either denotes a set or a whole respectively. The second determiner is usually an article, a demonstrative, a possessive determiner, or even another quantifier.\n\nJackendoff proposed a version of the partitive constraint in which the embedded determiner phrase (DP) must be definite, and thus must be headed by a definite determiner, such as \"the\", \"these\", or \"my\".\n\nHowever, this approach fails to account for phrases such as \"half of a cookie,\" that are partitives and yet lack a definite determiner. De Hoop instead points to the existence of set partitives and entity partitives in formulating the partitive constraint, rather than the definiteness of the NP. She states that:\n\n(2a) is ungrammatical even though it has a definite article because the denoted entity does not match. \"The water\" denotes an entity, and \"one\" is a set entity partitive determiner. (1b) is correct because indefinite and definite singular count nouns denote single entities rather than a set of entities, therefore it is grammatical when proceeded by \"half\", an entity partitive determiner.\n\nIt should also be noted that some linguists consider the partitive constraint to be problematic, since there may be cases where the determiner is not always obligatory. Linguists do, however, agree that universal quantifiers, such as: every, and each, cannot be embedded in the partitive position. Furthermore, the second determiner can be \"all\" only if the first determiner is a superlative, or fractional expression.\n\nIt has also been hypothesized that perhaps \"of\" in sentences, such as the above, do not act as the partitive themselves, but rather the superlative in the sentence provides the role of partition.\n\nBarker claims that partitives are \"anti-unique\"; that is, a partitive cannot refer to a unique individual or set of individuals, but must have at least two individuals or sets of individuals in its extension, causing a degree of indefiniteness.\n\nIn addition, he limits a partitive to being only able to refer to a proper subset, which he calls \"proper partitivity\". This means that, for example, in the partitive phrase \"one of John’s friends\", that John must have at least two friends for this to be a proper partitive, and in order for it to satisfy anti-uniqueness by not referring to a unique individual. Similarly, \"three of John’s friends\" would imply that John has at least four friends, from which an indeterminate three are being referred to.\n\nFurthermore, Barker states that DP partitive constructions cannot be headed by a definite determiner without being modified by a relative clause, that there is some inherent indefiniteness in partitives according to their property of anti-uniqueness. This explains why 4b) is ill-formed, since it is unclear which of John’s friends is being singled out, yet can be made to take a definite determiner by adding context, such as in 4c), which now refers to a single specific friend of John matching the modifier clause.\n\nA true partitive should be distinguished from a very similar construction called a quantitative (often called a \"pseudopartitive\", or sometimes a non-partitive).\n\nA true partitive, as shown in 5a), has the interpretation of a quantity being a part or subset of an entity or set. Quantitives, simply denote either a quantity of something or the number of members in a set, and contain a few important differences in relation to true partitives.\n\nFirst off, while partitives cannot be preceded by a definite determiner, such as in 6a), quantitatives can be; 6b) is a well-formed quantitive.\n\nWhile the NP in partitives is usually preceded by a definite determiner, the NP in quantitive constructions containing \"of\" cannot be preceded by any determiner; this distinguishes the true partitive in 5a) from the quantitative in 5b), which denotes a quantity of chocolates, but does not denote a smaller quantity of chocolates taken from a larger quantity of chocolates, as 5a) does.\n\nQuantitives can be interpreted as partitives, though, when modified. Consider the example, \"three children in the class\"; this means \"three children out of the children that are in the class\", which has a partitive meaning.\n\nOne point which is important in distinguishing between partitives and pseudopartitives in English is a separation between two semantically different \"of\"s. The first is a genitive \"of\", which indicates a kind-of or type-of relation demonstrated in the phrase \"a book of history\", in which \"of\" is used to modify the kind of book denoted, alternatively phrased as the compound noun \"a history book\". Similarly, \"a piece of chocolate\" can be analyzed as a certain kind of piece, namely a chocolate piece. The second is a partitive \"of\", which indicates a part-of relation and means \"out of the total number of\" in the case of set partitives. A partitive like \"a piece of this chocolate\" does not refer to any chocolate piece, but a piece taken from the whole of a certain chocolate.\nAlthough the syntactic distribution of partitives and pseudo-partitives seems to be complementary, cross-linguistic data suggests this is not always true. Non-partitives can display an identical syntactic structure as true partitives and the ultimate difference is a semantic one. Vos pointed out that Dutch contains nominals fulfilling the syntactic criterion but lacking a partitive interpretation; they are therefore classified as non-partitives.\n\nThe first Dutch phrase above is classified as a non-partitive. This is counter-intuitive at first glance because the phrase has a \"Det+of+Det+N\" sequence which is a consistent structure observed in partitives. A closer look at the Dutch data reveals that in denoting relativation and extraction relationships, non-partitives (or \"weak indirect partitive construction\" in Vos’s terminology) function as an adjectival modifier as opposed to ordinary partitives (\"strong indirect partitive construction\") carrying a determiner-like element. Therefore, die contains an adjectival meaning closer to 'such' and indicates funny examples of a certain \"type\". In the second example, die is truly a definite determiner and is referring to a particular larger set of funny examples.\n\nWhile a number of linguists have proposed different approaches to account for the partitive structure, three approaches will be introduced here.\n\nIn 1995, Guillermo Lorenzo proposed a partitive (π), which is equivalent to the meaning of \"out of\" in English, is a functional category by itself and projects to a phrasal level. A partitive phrase (πP) is selected by the Numeral (Num) and in turn the partitive head (π) selects the following DP. A Spanish example is shown below:\n\nAdvocates of the \"partitive prepositional phrase (partitive PP)\" approach claim that the partitive meaning is integrated into a PP. Structurally, a quantifier is followed by a noun, and a preposition in between denotes the quantifier is a subset of the following noun.\n\nWithin a partitive PP construct, the preposition \"of\" contains lexical content similar to ‘out of’ and always projects to a PP, hence the name partitive PP. Supporters of partitive PP often assume the presence of an empty noun following the quantifier in order to specify the two sets in relation and the preposition introduces the bigger set. Catalan provides evidence for this underlying structure:\n\nIn the first example, the notion denotes the set of \"three men\" is a subset of \"those men\". The second example has an overt noun inserted between the quantifier and the partitive PP and is still considered grammatical, albeit odd and redundant to a native speaker of Catalan. The third sentence has an empty noun holding the final noun position. Altogether this is taken as strong evidence that an empty noun category should be posited to license a partitive meaning.\nAlternatively, some linguists argued an empty noun placement is unnecessary if one considers the quantifier’s role to be quantifying a subset. The noun following the partitive PP automatically becomes the bigger set and the whole nominal represents a subset-set relation.\n\nClosely related to the partitive PP approach, some authors propose an alternate analysis which also focuses on looking at partitive distribution in nominals. Vos claims that it is the relationship between the quantifier and the noun collectively determine the partitive meaning.\n\nUnder this view, the preposition belongs to a functional category and its existence is solely for grammatical reasons. In other words, the preposition is not registered with any lexical content. Vos claims the internal relation between the first and second noun in a nominal partitive implicitly denotes a subset-set, possessive or part-whole relation. Similarly, de Hoop embraces the idea that only when a quantifier pairs with a desired type of DP, specific kind of partitive relation can then be determined. The preposition \"of\" plays a crucial role in enabling the selected DP to surface.\n\nThe deciding factor to label a partitive construction concerns with the presence of an internal DP, as demonstrated in the English examples below:\n\nThe nouns in the partitives all refer to a particular bigger set since they are preceded by an internal definite determiner (possessive: \"my\", demonstrative: \"this\" and \"those\", and definite article: \"the\"). On the other hand, their pseudo-counterparts lack this implication. Without a definite determiner, pseudo-partitives can only denote an amount of things and the characteristics of a set are determined by the context of the discourse. In addition, the set denoted in a pseudopartitive does not necessarily have to be bigger.\n\nIntuitively, the last two phrases under the pseudo-partitive column do indicate some kind of partition. However, when they are broken down into syntactic constituents, noted in true partitives, the noun always projects to a DP. In contrast, the noun in the phrase-final position projects to a NP (noun phrase) in non-partitives.\n\nThe partitive nominal construction consists of structure \"[DP Det. + of + [DP Det. + NP]]\", as shown in 10a).\n\nA related construction traditionally called the double genitive has been argued by Barker to actually be a partitive, which he terms the possessive partitive (shown in 10b), rather than simply a redundant application of the genitive marker ‘s.\n\nBarker claims that this is a use of the partitive \"of\", rather than the gentitive ‘of’, distinguishing it from being a gentitive construction. To support this, he notes that prenominal possessives such as \"Mary’s child\" cannot occur with a following possessor introduced by the genitive \"of\" such as, \"Mary’s child of John\". This phrase is illogical, since nominals are syntactically constrained to only allow one possessor. Yet, prenominal possessives can be combined with possessive partitives, containing the partitive \"of\", such as \"my favorite story of yours\". This phrase is grammatical, taking the meaning \"my favourite story out of your stories\".\n\nSimilarly, 11a) does not mean the same as 11b). The first is an instance of the gentitive \"of\", and means that John is in the picture. The second is an instance of the partitive \"of\", and hence is a possessive partitive; in contrast, it means a picture from the collection of pictures that belong to John, but does not say anything about whether John is in the picture.\n\nNor do 12a) and 12b) mean the same. The first is a possessive partitive, referring to someone who is a member of the set of John’s friends. The second includes a postnominal genitive \"of\" phrase, and refers instead to someone who is a friend in relation to a member of the set of John’s friends, but not necessarily to John himself.\n\nThe difference between the nominal partitive and the partitive possessive constructions may in fact be a matter of ellipsis in the phonetic forms, as suggested by Zamparelli.\n\nHe proposes that the two constructions have the same logical form, for example 13a), where the word friend has the same referent in both positions. Variations then arise in the phonetic form depending on which \"friend\" word is ellipsed. In the nominal partitive, the first \"friend\" is ellipsed, becoming 13b), whereas the possessive partitive ellipses the second instance of \"friend\", yielding 13c).\n\nFinnish indicates the partitive by inflecting nouns in the partitive case. An object takes the partitive case under the following three conditions:\n\nThe aspectual condition is if the object is governed by an unbounded (or atelic) verb, that is, one which does not indicate the result of an action. The NP-related (quantity) condition is if the object is quantitatively indeterminate, which means indefinite bare plurals or mass nouns [6]. Lastly, the negative condition applies when a predicate is negated, in which case nearly all objects are marked with the partitive.\n\nThese three conditions are generally considered to be hierarchically ranked according to their strength such that negation > aspect > quantity. Negation is strongest in that it applies so pervasively to negated events, regardless of aspect or quantity.\n\nAn example of the NP-related condition is shown below, borrowed from Huumo:\n\nIn 14a), the object is a mass noun, where the partitive case indicates an open, unspecified quantity of butter using the suffix \"-ta\", as opposed to a closed quantity or total object, which Finnish would specify by using the accusative suffix –n, as in 14b).\n\nThese two examples in 14) show the contrast that exists in Finnish between the partitive object and total object, the former indicating incompleteness of an event or an open quantity. Whereas the partitive object takes the partitive case, the total object can be marked with nominative, genitive, or accusative and indicates aspectual completeness or closed quantity.\n\nIn the case of 15a), the partitive object is triggered by the unbounded aspect of the verb, not the quantity of the object, since the openness of the quantity is irrelevant. Unboundedness in verbs denotes whether there is a direct consequence following the action of the verb. The verb’s aspect is progressive, involving an ongoing action without a specified endpoint, and is therefore unbounded. This aspectual unboundedness requires the partitive object, and has the effect of concealing the quantity of the object. This shows that aspect is stronger than quantity in conditioning the partitive.\n\nIn 15b) and 15c), \"to shoot\" in Finnish is an intrinsically neither bound nor unbound verb since the shooting can cause the three different results of the target being killed or only wounded or not being hit. (In English, \"to shoot\" with a direct object has the first two senses and requires additions such as \"dead\" or \"and killed\" to not be ambivalent, and the third sense is only possible by adding the preposition \"at\".) \"To kill\" would be an intrinsically bound verb, where the consequence is someone/something being dead. In the data, the morpheme \"–a\" is the partitive morpheme. In 15b, the verb \"shot\" takes a partitive object and specifies the activities of \"shooting without killing\" or \"shooting at but not necessarily hitting\". In 15c, the verb takes an accusative object and denotes accomplishment of hitting and killing. Hence, the difference of unboundness or boundness in the verb, whether the bear was hit (and killed) by the bullet or not, is reflected by the difference in the morphology of the object.\n\nThe common factor between aspectual and NP-related functions of the partitive case is the process of marking a verb phrase’s (VP) unboundness. A VP has the semantic property of having either an unbounded head or unbounded argument. For example, in Finnish the partitive case suffix denotes an unbound event, while the accusative case suffix denotes a bounded event. Note that when translating Finnish into English, the determiners could surface as \"a\", \"the\", \"some\" or numerals in both unbound and bound events.\n\n"}
{"id": "244283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244283", "title": "English compound", "text": "English compound\n\nA compound is a word composed of more than one free morpheme. The English language, like many others, uses compounds frequently. English compounds may be classified in several ways, such as the word classes or the semantic relationship of their components.\n\nMost English compound nouns are noun phrases (i.e. nominal phrases) that include a noun modified by adjectives or noun adjuncts. Due to the English tendency towards conversion, the two classes are not always easily distinguished. Most English compound nouns that consist of more than two words can be constructed recursively by combining two words at a time. Combining \"science\" and \"fiction\", and then combining the resulting compound with \"writer\", for example, can construct the compound \"science fiction writer\". Some compounds, such as \"salt and pepper\" or \"mother-of-pearl\", cannot be constructed in this way,\n\nSince English is a mostly analytic language, unlike most other Germanic languages, it creates compounds by concatenating words without case markers. As in other Germanic languages, the compounds may be arbitrarily long. However, this is obscured by the fact that the written representation of long compounds always contains spaces. Short compounds may be written in three different ways, which do not correspond to different pronunciations, however:\n\n\nUsage in the US and in the UK differs and often depends on the individual choice of the writer rather than on a hard-and-fast rule; therefore, open, hyphenated, and closed forms may be encountered for the same compound noun, such as the triplets \"container ship\"/\"container-ship\"/\"containership\" and \"particle board\"/\"particle-board\"/\"particleboard\".\n\nIn addition to this native English compounding, there is the \"classical\" type, which consists of words derived from Latin, as \"horticulture\", and those of Greek origin, such as \"photography\", the components of which are in bound form (connected by connecting vowels, which are most often \"-i-\" and \"-o-\" in Latin and Greek respectively) and cannot stand alone.\n\nIn general, the meaning of a compound noun is a specialization of the meaning of its head. The modifier limits the meaning of the head. This is most obvious in descriptive compounds (known as \"karmadharaya\" compounds in the Sanskrit tradition), in which the modifier is used in an attributive or appositional manner. A \"blackboard\" is a particular kind of board, which is (generally) black, for instance.\n\nIn determinative compounds, however, the relationship is not attributive. For example, a \"footstool\" is not a particular type of stool that is like a foot. Rather, it is a \"stool for one's foot or feet\". (It can be used for sitting on, but that is not its primary purpose.) In a similar manner, an \"office manager\" is the manager of an office, an \"armchair\" is a \"chair with arms\", and a \"raincoat\" is a \"coat against the rain\". These relationships, which are expressed by prepositions in English, would be expressed by grammatical case in other languages. (Compounds of this type are known as \"tatpurusha\" in the Sanskrit tradition.)\n\nBoth of the above types of compounds are called endocentric compounds because the semantic head is contained within the compound itself — a blackboard is a type of board, for example, and a footstool is a type of stool.\n\nHowever, in another common type of compound, the exocentric (known as a bahuvrihi compound in the Sanskrit tradition), the semantic head is not explicitly expressed. A \"redhead\", for example, is not a kind of head, but is a person \"with\" red hair. Similarly, a \"blockhead\" is also not a head, but a person with a head that is as hard and unreceptive as a block (i.e. stupid). And a \"lionheart\" is not a type of heart, but a person with a heart like a lion (in its bravery, courage, fearlessness, etc.).\n\nNote in general the way to tell the two apart:\n\n\nExocentric compounds occur more often in adjectives than nouns. A \"V-8 car\" is a car \"with\" a V-8 engine rather than a car that \"is\" a V-8, and a \"twenty-five-dollar car\" is a car \"with\" a worth of $25, not a car that \"is\" $25. The compounds shown here are bare, but more commonly, a suffixal morpheme is added, such as \"-ed\": a \"two-legged\" person is a person \"with\" two legs, and this is exocentric.\n\nOn the other hand, endocentric adjectives are also frequently formed, using the suffixal morphemes \"-ing\" or \"-er/or\". A \"people-carrier\" is a clear endocentric determinative compound: it is a thing that \"is\" a carrier of people. The related adjective, \"car-carrying\", is also endocentric: it refers to an object which \"is\" a carrying-thing (or equivalently, which \"does\" carry).\n\nThese types account for most compound nouns, but there are other, rarer types as well. \"Coordinative\", \"copulative\" or \"dvandva\" compounds combine elements with a similar meaning, and the compound meaning may be a generalization instead of a specialization. \"Bosnia-Herzegovina\", for example, is the combined area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but a \"fighter-bomber\" is an aircraft that is both a fighter and a bomber. \"Iterative\" or \"amredita\" compounds repeat a single element, to express repetition or as an emphasis. \"Day by day\" and \"go-go\" are examples of this type of compound, which has more than one head.\n\nAnalyzability may be further limited by cranberry morphemes and semantic changes. For instance, the word \"butterfly\", commonly thought to be a metathesis for \"flutter by\", which the bugs do, is actually based on an old wives' tale that butterflies are small witches that steal butter from window sills. \"Cranberry\" is a part translation from Low German, which is why we cannot recognize the element \"cran\" (from the Low German \"kraan\" or \"kroon\", \"crane\"). The \"ladybird\" or \"ladybug\" was named after the Christian expression \"our \"Lady\", the Virgin Mary\".\n\nIn the case of verb+noun compounds, the noun may be either the subject or the object of the verb. In \"playboy\", for example, the noun is the subject of the verb (\"the boy plays\"), whereas it is the object in \"callgirl\" (\"someone calls the girl\").\n\nStress patterns may distinguish a compound word from a noun phrase consisting of the same component words. For example, a \"black board,\" adjective plus noun, is any board that is black, and has equal stress on both elements. The compound \"blackboard\", on the other hand, though it may have started out historically as \"black board\", now is stressed on only the first element, \"black\". Thus a compound such as \"the White House\" normally has a falling intonation which a phrase such as \"a white house\" does not.\n\nEnglish compound modifiers are constructed in a very similar way to the compound noun. \"Blackboard Jungle\", \"leftover ingredients\", \"gunmetal sheen\", and \"green monkey disease\" are only a few examples.\n\nA compound modifier is a sequence of modifiers of a noun that function as a single unit. It consists of two or more words (adjectives, gerunds, or nouns) of which the left-hand component modifies the right-hand one, as in \"the dark-green dress\": \"dark\" modifies the \"green\" that modifies \"dress\".\n\nThere are some well-established permanent compound modifiers that have become solid over a longer period, especially in American usage: \"earsplitting\", \"eyecatching\", and \"downtown\".\n\nHowever, in British usage, these, apart from \"downtown\", are more likely written with a hyphen: \"ear-splitting\", \"eye-catching\".\n\nOther solid compound modifiers are for example:\n\nMajor style guides advise consulting a dictionary to determine whether a compound modifier should be hyphenated; the dictionary's hyphenation should be followed even when the compound modifier follows a noun (that is, regardless of whether in attributive or predicative position), because they are permanent compounds (whereas the general rule with temporary compounds is that hyphens are omitted in the predicative position because they are used only when necessary to prevent misreading, which is usually only in the attributive position, and even there, only on a case-by-case basis).\n\nGenerally, a compound modifier is hyphenated if the hyphen helps the reader differentiate a compound modifier from two adjacent modifiers that modify the noun independently. Compare the following examples:\n\n\nThe hyphen is unneeded when capitalization or italicization makes grouping clear:\n\n\nIf, however, there is no risk of ambiguities, it may be written without a hyphen: \"Sunday morning walk\" (a \"walk on Sunday morning\" is practically the same as a \"morning walk on Sunday\").\n\nHyphenated compound modifiers may have been formed originally by an adjective preceding a noun, when this phrase in turn precedes another noun:\n\nOthers may have originated with a verb preceding an adjective or adverb:\n\nYet others are created with an original verb preceding a preposition.\n\n\nThe following compound modifiers are \"always\" hyphenated when they are not written as one word:\n\nThe following compound modifiers are not normally hyphenated:\n\n\nSpecial rules apply when multiple compound nouns with the same \"head\" are used together, often with a conjunction (and with hyphens and commas if they are needed).\n\n\nA compound verb is usually composed of an adverb and a verb, although other combinations also exist. The term \"compound verb\" was first used in publication in Grattan and Gurrey's \"Our Living Language\" (1925).\n\nSome compound verbs are difficult to analyze morphologically because several derivations are plausible. \"Blacklist\", for instance, might be analyzed as an adjective+verb compound, or as an adjective+noun compound that becomes a verb through zero derivation. Most compound verbs originally have the collective meaning of both components, but some of them later gain additional meanings that may supersede the original, emergent sense. Therefore, sometimes the resultant meanings are seemingly barely related to the original contributors.\n\nCompound verbs composed of a noun and verb are comparatively rare, and the noun is generally not the direct object of the verb. In English, compounds such as *\"bread-bake\" or *\"car-drive\" do not exist. Yet, we find literal action words, such as \"breastfeed\", and washing instructions on clothing as for example \"hand wash\".\n\nCompound verbs with single-syllable modifiers are often solid, or unhyphenated. Those with longer modifiers may originally be hyphenated, but as they became established, they became solid, e.g.\n\n\nThere was a tendency in the 18th century to use hyphens excessively, that is, to hyphenate all previously established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished the use of hyphens, while British English is more conservative.\n\nEnglish syntax distinguishes between phrasal verbs and adverbial adjuncts. Consider the following sentences:\n\nEach of the foregoing sentences implies a contextually distinguishable meaning of the word, \"up,\" but the fourth sentence may differ syntactically, depending on whether it intends meaning (a) or (b). Specifically, the first three sentences render \"held up\" as a phrasal verb that expresses an idiomatic, figurative, or metaphorical sense that depends on the contextual meaning of the particle, \"up.\" The fourth sentence, however, ambiguously renders \"up\" either as (a) a particle that complements \"held,\" or as (b) an adverb that modifies \"held.\" The ambiguity is minimized by rewording and providing more context to the sentences under discussion:\n\nThus, the fifth sentence renders \"up\" as the head word of an adverbial prepositional phrase that modifies, the verb, \"held\". The first four sentences remain phrasal verbs. \n\nThe \"Oxford English Grammar\" () distinguishes seven types of phrasal verbs in English:\n\n\nEnglish has a number of other kinds of compound verb idioms. There are compound verbs with two verbs (e.g. \"make do\"). These too can take idiomatic prepositions (e.g. \"get rid of\"). There are also idiomatic combinations of verb and adjective (e.g. \"come true\", \"run amok\") and verb and adverb (\"make sure\"), verb and fixed noun (e.g. \"go ape\"); and these, too, may have fixed idiomatic prepositions (e.g. \"take place on\").\n\n\"Compound verb\" is often used in place of:\n\n"}

{"id": "244786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244786", "title": "Cornbread", "text": "Cornbread\n\nCornbread is any quick bread containing cornmeal, and a Native American cuisine. They are usually leavened by baking powder.\n\nNative Americans had been using ground corn (maize) for food thousands of years before European explorers arrived in the New World.\nEuropean settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread has been called a \"cornerstone\" of the cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A coarser meal (compare flour) made from corn is grits. Grits are produced by soaking raw corn grains in hot water containing calcium hydroxide (an alkaline salt), which loosens the grain hulls (bran) and increases the nutritional value of the product (by increasing available niacin and available amino acids). These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy. Hominy, \"posole\" in Spanish, also is ground into \"masa harina\" for tamales and tortillas. This ancient Native American technology has been named nixtamalization. Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean \"chicha\"). Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different forms—high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried (as unleavened pone, corn fritters, hoecakes, etc.).\n\nCornbread is a popular item in Southern cooking enjoyed by many people for its texture and aroma. Cornbread can be baked, fried, or (rarely) steamed. Steamed cornbread is mushy, chewier, and more like cornmeal pudding than what most consider to be traditional cornbread. Cornbread can also be baked into corn cakes.\n\nCornbread is a common bread in United States cuisine, particularly associated with the South and Southwest, as well as being a traditional staple for populations where wheat flour was more expensive. In some parts of the South it is crumbled into a glass of cold milk or buttermilk and eaten with a spoon, and it is also widely eaten with barbecue and chili con carne. In parts of the southern and southwestern United States, cornbread, accompanied by pinto beans, has been a common lunch for many people. It is still a common side dish, often served with homemade butter, chunks of onion or scallions. Cornbread crumbs are also used in some poultry stuffings; cornbread stuffing is particularly associated with Thanksgiving turkeys.\n\nIn the United States, northern and southern cornbread are different because they generally use different types of corn meal and varying degrees of sugar and eggs. Southern cornbread has traditionally been made with little or no sugar and smaller amounts of flour (or no flour), with northern cornbread being sweeter and more cake-like. Southern cornbread traditionally used white cornmeal and buttermilk. Other ingredients such as pork rinds are sometimes used. Cornbread is occasionally crumbled and served with cold milk or clabber (buttermilk), similar to cold cereal. In Texas, Mexican influence has spawned a hearty cornbread made with fresh or creamed corn kernels and jalapeño peppers and topped with shredded cheese. Cornbread is typically eaten with molasses in the southern states and with butter and honey in the northern states of America.\n\nSkillet-fried or skillet-baked cornbread (often simplified to cornbread or skillet bread) is a traditional staple in the rural United States, especially in the South. This involves heating bacon drippings, lard or other oil in a heavy, well-seasoned cast iron skillet in an oven, and then pouring a batter made from cornmeal, egg, and milk directly into the hot grease. The mixture is returned to the oven to bake into a large, crumbly and sometimes very moist cake with a crunchy crust. This bread tends to be dense and is usually served as an accompaniment rather than as a bread served as a regular course. In addition to the skillet method, such cornbread also may be made in sticks, muffins, or loaves.\n\nA slightly different variety, cooked in a simple baking dish, is associated with northern U.S. cuisine; it tends to be sweeter and lighter than southern-style cornbread; the batter for northern-style cornbread is very similar to and sometimes interchangeable with that of a corn muffin. A typical contemporary northern U.S. cornbread recipe contains half wheat flour, half cornmeal, milk or buttermilk, eggs, leavening agent, salt, and usually sugar, resulting in a bread that is somewhat lighter and sweeter than the traditional southern version.\n\nUnlike fried variants of cornbread, baked cornbread is a quick bread that is dependent on an egg-based protein matrix for its structure (though the addition of wheat flour adds gluten to increase its cohesiveness). The baking process gelatinizes the starch in the cornmeal, but still often leaves some hard starch to give the finished product a distinctive sandiness not typical of breads made from other grains.\n\nA primarily Southern dish consisting of cornbread with pork cracklings inside. It can be prepared with any method but a skillet is most common as it allows for making the cornbread crispier.\n\nCorn pone (sometimes referred to as \"Indian pone\") is a type of cornbread made from a thick, malleable cornmeal dough (which is usually egg-less and milk-less) and cooked in a specific type of iron pan over an open fire (such as a frontiersman would use), using butter, margarine, shortening, or cooking oil. Corn pones have been a staple of Southern U.S. cuisine, and have been discussed by many American writers, including Mark Twain.\n\nIn the Appalachian Mountains, cornbread baked in a round iron skillet, or in a cake pan of any shape, is still referred to as a \"pone\" of cornbread (as opposed to \"hoe cakes,\" the term for cornbread fried in pancake style); and when biscuit dough (i.e., \"biscuits\" in the American sense of the word) is occasionally baked in one large cake rather than as separate biscuits, this is called a \"biscuit pone.\"\n\nThe term \"corn pone\" is sometimes used derogatorily to refer to one who possesses certain rural, unsophisticated peculiarities (\"he's a corn pone\"), or as an adjective to describe particular rural, folksy or \"hick\" characteristics (e.g., \"corn pone\" humor). This pejorative term often is directed at persons from rural areas of the southern and midwestern US. A character in the Lil' Abner comic strip, General Jubilation T Cornpone, was a mythical Civil War general from Dogpatch known for his retreats and imputed cowardice. President John F. Kennedy's staffers, who were mostly Northeastern Ivy League elites, openly mocked Texan Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's rural speech patterns, referring to Johnson behind his back as 'Uncle Cornpone' or 'Rufus Cornpone'.\n\nCooked on a rangetop, one frying method involves pouring a small amount of liquid batter made with boiling water and self-rising cornmeal (cornmeal with soda or some other chemical leavener added) into a skillet of hot oil, and allowing the crust to turn golden and crunchy while the center of the batter cooks into a crumbly, mushy bread. These small (3-4\" diameter) fried breads are soft and very rich. Sometimes, to ensure the consistency of the bread, a small amount of wheat flour is added to the batter. This type of cornbread is often known as \"hot water\" or \"scald meal\" cornbread and is unique to the American South.\n\nPouring a batter similar to that of skillet-fried cornbread, but slightly thinner, into hot grease atop a griddle or a skillet produces a pancake-like bread called a johnnycake. This type of cornbread is prevalent in New England, particularly in Rhode Island, and also in the American Midwest and the American South. It is reminiscent of the term hoecake, used in the American South for fried cornbread pancakes, which may date back to stories about some people on the frontier making cornbread patties on the blade of a hoe.\n\nA thicker buttermilk-based batter that is deep-fried rather than pan-fried, forms the hushpuppy, a common accompaniment to fried fish and other seafood in the South. Hushpuppy recipes vary from state to state, some including onion seasoning, chopped onions, beer, or jalapeños. Fried properly, the hushpuppy will be moist and yellow or white on the inside, while crunchy and light to medium-dark golden brown on the outside.\n\n"}

Several additional species belonging to the genus \"Ephedra\" have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the Soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. Native Americans and Mormon pioneers drank a tea brewed from other \"Ephedra\" species, called \"Mormon tea\" and \"Indian tea\".\nIn recent years, dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids have been found to be unsafe, with reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths. In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally today.\n\nA wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of \"ephedra\". Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in \"ephedra\" (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.\n\nEphedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.\n\nEphedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.\n\nAdverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nThere are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.\n\nEscalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.\n\nIn 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nIn response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe. The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.\n\nMetabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA. Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.\n\nIn addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas. \"Business Week\" reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been \"beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.\"\n\nIn 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.\n\nA review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA. Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer from heatstroke in 2001.\n\nSteve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a \"significant role\" in Bechler's sudden death. Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \"All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act.\"\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that \"...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist\", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra \"long overdue.\"\n\nIn response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects. Almost simultaneously, a study in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or \"Ginkgo biloba\".\n\nOn December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that \"...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.\" Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.\n\nNutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.\n\nEphedrine is listed as a banned substance by both the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The National Football League banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Korey Stringer; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death. The substance is also banned by the National Basketball Association. Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra believing it enhanced their athletic performance.\n\nIn the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Argentine footballer Diego Armando Maradona tested positive for ephedrine. The Japanese motorcycle racer Noriyuki Haga tested positive for ephedrine in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result. NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "246992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246992", "title": "Angel food cake", "text": "Angel food cake\n\nAngel food cake, or angel cake, is a type of sponge cake made with egg whites, flour, and sugar. A whipping agent, such as cream of tartar, is commonly added. It differs from other cakes because it uses no butter. Its structure comes from whipped egg whites known as a protein foam. Angel food cake originated in the United States and first became popular in the late 19th century. It gained its unique reputation along with its name due to its light and fluffy texture, said to resemble the \"food of the angels\".\n\nAngel food cake requires egg whites whipped until they are stiff; cream of tartar is added to the mixture to stabilize the egg whites. Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the egg white mixture. For this method of leavening to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat; cake flour is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.\n\nAngel food cake should be cut with a serrated knife, as a straight-edged blade tends to compress the cake rather than slice it. Forks, electric serrated knives, special tined cutters or a strong thread should be used instead.\n\nAngel food cake is usually baked in a tube pan, a tall, round pan with a tube up the center that leaves a hole in the middle of the cake. A bundt pan may also be used, but the fluted sides can make releasing the cake more difficult. The center tube allows the cake batter to rise higher by 'clinging' to all sides of the pan. The angel food cake pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other cakes, this allows the cake to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise. After baking, the cake pan is inverted while cooling to prevent the cake from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular. Recently, many chefs (Alton Brown in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to the cake.\n\nAngel food cake is a white sponge cake made with only stiffly beaten egg whites (yolks would make it yellow and inhibit the stiffening of the whites) and no butter. The first recipe in a cookbook for a white sponge cake is in Lettice Bryan's \"The Kentucky Housewife\" of 1839. Since there is no butter in the cake, the angel food cake is not related to the butter cakes: snow-drift cake, silver cake or lady cake.\n\n\"The Home Messenger Book of Tested Recipes\", 2d ed., 1878, by Isabella Stewart contained the first recipe for Angel's Food Cake. Stewart's detailed recipe called for eleven egg whites, sugar, flour, vanilla extract and cream of tartar.\n\nThe most traditional method, also known as the angel food cake method is as follows. First the egg whites, and possibly salt and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed until a soft peak forms. Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard peak is formed, the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.\n\nDifferent equipment is used when preparing an angel food cake at home or in a small bakery as opposed to a large scale production. Many recipes found in cookbooks advise bakers to whip the egg whites in a copper bowl. The theory behind this is that the whisk incorporates copper particles or ovotransferrin, which is attached to copper particles, into the egg whites, improving the flexibility and stability of the foam. Some research has found that the copper significantly increases the dilatational elasticity, which is the elasticity of the protein cell wall at the interface of air/water.\n\nA planetary mixer, such as a stand mixer or handheld mixer, is appropriate for a homemade or bakery cake. If the cake is being mass-produced, a continuous mixer is preferred. There are three methods in which the cake can be made at home or in a commercial setting. The first two methods are most commonly used at home or in a small bakery using planetary mixers in various sizes. Large planetary mixers may have a vacuum in order to pressurize the ingredients. This allows for control of the emulsion and temperature.\n\nThe first method is the foam process or angel food cake method. The egg whites are whipped until a foam is formed before any other ingredients are added. This method ensures that the foam is not disturbed when it is being formed and that the maximum number of bubbles stay intact. Another method is called the meringue process. This entails whipping all or most of the ingredients together at the same time. This may result in a lower quality foam and a final cake with a reduced volume. The last method is called the continuous process and is usually used in commercial bakeries because it creates a consistent product in large volumes. Ingredients are fed into the continuous mixer in either one or two stages. A one-stage process mixes all of the ingredients together and feeds them into an emulsion head. Upon entry into the emulsion head, air is incorporated, fully mixing the batter. In a two-stage process, the ingredients are blended separately in different tanks according to the recipe. The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter. The final batter may then go through a static mixer (a pipe with a spiral blade inside) to be deposited in a tube pan, depositor, or hopper.\n\nNormally angel food cakes are baked in a straight-sided tube pan, but similar pans such as a bundt pan are acceptable. It is very important that the pan does not have a non-stick surface and that no grease is applied to the sides or around the tube. As the cake bakes, it expands and rises. The sides and hollow center tube act as supports for the foam as it expands. The hollow pan also allows for an even heat distribution.\n\nFor the optimal angel food cake outcome, experts believe that the cake should be baked for at the shortest amount of time at the highest temperature. The temperature and duration depends on the size and weight of the cake. Temperatures range from 325 to 375 °F, while baking time ranges from 30 minutes to one hour (Suas, M. 2009). If the angel food cake does not bake long enough, the foam and gel structures will not reach their full potential.\n\nIn a bakery, angel food cakes could be baked in a rack oven, revolving oven, convention oven, or small deck oven. A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling oven. When the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area. The final volume will generally be two to three times larger than the batter volume.\n\nAngel food cakes are cooled upside down. Some tube pans have “feet” or “fingers” that extend off of the top rim of the pan. The “feet” are placed on a cooling rack. If the pan does not have “feet” it is customary for home bakers to place a glass soda bottle or something similar through the tube to ensure that the pan is elevated. The elevation provides sufficient air flow to the cake, so that it cools properly. If a non-stick pan or greased pan were used, the cake would fall out when inverted, leading to a collapsed cake.\n\nAngel food cakes have a shelf-life of a few days at room temperature or up to a week in a refrigerator because of the tendency for moisture to migrate and evaporate. After a few days the cake will be dry and lack flexibility.\n\nEgg whites play an integral role in the structure of the baked cake. Egg whites are composed of many proteins, however only ovalbumin, conalbumin, lysozyme, and globulins have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake. Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal or greater to the size of the egg whites.\n\nEgg white proteins have many uses in baking, one of which is the ability to create and maintain a foam. Whipping incorporates air throughout the egg whites, as well as denaturing or unfolding the proteins to create thinner protein molecules. Overrun, similar to lightness, describes the amount of air pushed into the foam. In terms of an angel food cake, overrun is the increase in volume from the original volume caused by the inclusion of air. The overrun of an egg white foam ranges from 500 to 800%. This means that whipping 100 mL of egg whites would result in 500 mL - 800 mL of air incorporated into the foam. During whipping, protein adsorption allows for rapid foam formation. Adsorption is the ability to spontaneously form a very thin layer on a surface. The denatured proteins move to the air/water interface to create the cell walls of the air bubbles. Cell wall formation occurs when the denatured proteins aggregate, forming an extremely thin network or film. Many interactions between the proteins and the interface are possible, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, disulfate bonds, and Van der Waals interactions. A cake made with egg yolks would not be as light and airy because they have a lower foaming ability than egg whites.\n\nThis move, to the air/water interface, by the proteins is also aided by their hydrophobic and hydrophilic part. The hydrophobic moieties orient themselves toward the air while the hydrophilic moieties orient themselves toward the water portion of the interface. The air molecules at the air/water interface interact less with the other molecules that are fully inside the bubble. This lack of interaction causes the air molecules to have excess energy, resulting in surface tension. The presence of egg white proteins at the interface acts as a surfactant which lowers the surface tension and promotes foam development. A foam is a type of emulsion: air in an aqueous solution. If the surface tension was not lowered, the air bubbles would coalescence and the emulsion would separate.\n\nThe interfacial dilational modulus (E) describes how the egg white proteins or surfactants covering the air/water interface are able to resist deformation from stretching or compression. An elastic and viscosity component are incorporated into the value, which account for the energy that is lost and recovered as a result of deformation.\n\nE = dγ/d ln A\n\nE: interfacial dilational modulus\n\nγ: change in interfacial tension\n\nA: change in interfacial area at a constant shape\n\nThe most stable and volumous foams are created when the egg white proteins are near their isoelectric points. Protein adsorption is most rapid at the isoelectric point because electrostatic repulsion is reduced for proteins with a neutral net charge. The viscoelasticity of protein foam films is usually at its highest near its isoelectric point. This is why acid is usually added to the cake batter, in order to adjust the pH.\n\nThe preparation of the batter should be done as quickly as possible. When the foam sits, disproportionation will occur. This is the result of water draining from the foam and collecting at the bottom. The bubbles at the top of the foam will grow larger as the water leaves and the cell walls or film become too weak and break, forming larger bubbles.\n\nWhipping aids improve the foaming properties of albumen, a protein found in egg whites, which means a firmer foam will be established in a shorter amount of time. Cream of tartar is an acidic salt which adjusts the pH of egg whites so the proteins will be more soluble, as well as reducing protein denaturation during whipping. If cream of tartar is not used the cake may not reach its maximum achievable volume. Cream of tartar also decolorizes the flavone pigments in flour, which gives a final cake that is a bright white color. The whiteness of the cake is also caused by the way cream of tartar creates very small and uniform air bubbles, which gives the cake the appearance of being whiter after baking.\n\nThe baking process causes the batter to expand and go from a liquid to a solid foam. The proteins will not start to denature until the temperature reaches around 158 °F. During this rise in temperature the air bubbles will either expand, coalesce, or break. An egg white foam will continue to expand uniformly until the internal temperature reaches 176 – 185 °F. Based on the ideal gas law, as the temperature increases, the volume of the air bubbles will expand. The temperature will continue to rise, causing the cake to expand at different rates and egg white proteins will gradually denature. Some of the egg white proteins will start to denature and coagulate at around 135 °F. This establishes the setting of the foam structure. By the time the temperature reaches 180 °F, all of the egg white proteins will have set in place.\n\nThe foam structure will decrease slightly or collapse in order to form a solid foam of less volume. This occurs while the cake is still baking, not when it is cooling. The combination of protein denaturation and starch gelatinization determines whether the cake will set or collapse. When proteins denature, they are not in a stable state. In order to stabilize, the denatured proteins will aggregate around air bubbles and within the continuous phase of the batter. The aggregation and overlapping of the proteins forms a very stable network.\n\nThe flour plays an important role in the texture, structure and elasticity of an angel food cake. Minimal folding of the flour allows cell walls to form when it comes in contact with the egg protein foam and sugar mixture. If the batter is over-mixed, the egg white proteins may coagulate causing the bubbles to break during baking, or the cell walls may become too rigid, lacking elasticity. This would reduce the volume and result in a coarse texture. However, if the batter is under-mixed, a weak foam will form.\n\nA gluten matrix is formed when the proteins glutenin and gliadin, found in wheat flour, are mixed in the presence of water. When the batter is agitated, these two proteins form cross-links, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. The matrix that forms is strong and very flexible. Although no water is added to the batter, the gluten reacts with the water found in egg whites. Since air has already been entrapped in the foam, the flour proteins can only coat the already entrapped air. This helps to strengthen the cell walls and batter during baking or any other handling. This is beneficial because the meringue on its own is weak, cannot expand in heat, and does not have any elasticity normally expected in cakes.\n\nStarch gelatinization occurs around the same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When starch granules are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other starch granules. About 96% of the starch granules are gelatinized. Starch granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in s collapsed cake.\n\nSugar functions as a sweetener, stabilizer, and tenderizer. The amount of sugar has a large impact on the overrun and stability of the foam. When sugar and egg whites are whipped together, a meringue is formed. If the amount of sugar is less than or equal to the amount of egg whites, a soft meringue is formed. A stiffer meringue is formed when there is more sugar than egg white. Angel food cakes usually have equal parts sugar and egg white. Sugar will disturb protein foam formation in a positive or negative manner. It is also important that the sugar is added slowly, so that the crystals have a chance to dissolve. It is typically added after a weak foam has been formed. This way it can help stabilize the foam instead of impeding on it, causing coagulation and collapse. When the sugar dissolves, it interacts with the proteins at the air/water interface, creating a thicker and more stable cell wall. The sugar can also assist in the denaturing and aggregation of egg white proteins, which increases overrun, giving a lighter texture. Sugar binds water through hydrogen bonds, which allows for a moist final cake and why all of the moisture does not leave during baking.\n\nSince there is no shortening, butter, fat, or oil, sugar is the only tenderizer. The more sugar added, the more tender the cake will be. However, if too much is added, the cake may collapse because the foam structure is not strong enough to support itself.\n\nWhen the cake has finished baking, it should have a golden brown color on the exposed area. This is due to Maillard browning reactions. If the cake bakes for too long, more moisture will be removed and the texture will turn out dry, rough and potentially burnt.\n\nCommercial bakeries have a need to reduce cost and increase the shelf life for mass-produced products. For these reasons they use many ingredients that vary from the traditional angel food cake recipe.\n\nDehydrated and frozen egg whites are cheaper and more efficient than fresh egg whites. However, each lot of dehydrated egg whites varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants that have been used to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid. Frozen egg whites do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh egg whites. It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs. Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric. These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.\n\nInstead of using pure cake flour, wheat flour or a mixture of wheat flour and raw wheat starch is used. The wheat flour is bleached to remove any brown pigments and produce a bright white color. The pH of the bleached flour is between 3 and 4.5, although the optimal pH of starch gelatinization is between 3.7 and 3.9. Acidifiers are used in order to reach this pH range. The optimal flour protein content is between 3% and 4%, and must be below 4.5%. If a mixture is used, at least 20% by weight should be wheat flour. A small amount of raw wheat starch may be added to the sugar as a grinding aid.\n\nPregelatinized starch may be added to increase the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has it would be if a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of other starches also work.\n\nA balanced chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate, along with an acidifier is another common ingredient. When reacted together, the acidifier has the ability to release all of the carbon dioxide from the sodium bicarbonate. A variety of acidifiers can be used, including potassium bitartrate, tartaric acid, and disodium phosphate. The type of acidifier used depends on when the preferred release of CO is. If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting. The amount of acidifier depends on which agent, such as sodium bicarbonate, is used because they have varying neutralization points.\n\nAn excess acidifier is also added, however it isn’t used in combination with the sodium bicarbonate. Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain the egg white protein foam volume in the baking cake. At a lower pH, the egg white proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking. The optimal pH for the batter is between 5.5 and 6.8. It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess acidifier is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.\n\nAdding a small amount of calcium chloride may be used to alter the pH to the optimum value when dehydrated egg whites with a higher pH are used. It may also alter the flour gelatinization temperature. This ensures that when large quantities of cakes are produced, the cakes will be the best possible quality and volume, without a gummy layer forming.\n\nA whipping aid such as modified soy protein can help to account for the decreased foaming ability of dehydrated or frozen egg whites. Modified soy protein is a soy protein in a solution which is then acidified using hydrochloric acid. Pepsin or another enzyme is then added to enhance the protein foaming abilities. Once the enzyme activity has ceased, the solution is heated to deactivate the enzyme and more hydrochloric acid is added if a pH adjustment is required.\n\nOxidized wheat starch is a tenderizing agent that may be added to give the angel food cake a lighter texture. Raw wheat starch is treated with sodium hypochlorite, neutralized, purified, and dried. The final starch has molecules with shorter chain lengths, which prevents the gel network from being too tough.\n\nUnlike a homemade angel food cake, water may be used when mixing the dry ingredients, as well as to reconstitute dehydrated egg whites.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "247079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247079", "title": "Mars (chocolate bar)", "text": "Mars (chocolate bar)\n\nMars is a variety of chocolate bar produced by Mars, Incorporated. It was first manufactured in 1932 in Slough, England by Forrest Mars, Sr. The bar was sold in two different formulations. In its original British version the bar consists of milk chocolate surrounding caramel and nougat, developed to resemble the American candy bar known as the Milky Way, which had been introduced a decade earlier. An American version of the Mars Bar was produced which had nougat and toasted almonds covered in milk chocolate; later, caramel was added to the recipe as well. The American version was discontinued in 2002, though it has been revived for short runs since then.\n\nIn 1932, Forrest Mars, son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars, rented a factory in Slough and with a staff of twelve people, began manufacturing a chocolate bar consisting of nougat and caramel covered in milk chocolate (originally advertised as using Cadbury's chocolate couverture), modelled after his father's Milky Way bar, which was already popular in the US. The bar and the proportions of the main components have changed over the years. With minor variations, this version is sold worldwide, except for the US, and is packaged in a black wrapper with red gold-edged lettering.\n\nIn 2002, the Mars bar was reformulated and its logo was updated with a more cursive appearance except in Australia where it is still has the pre-2002 logo. Its price also increased. The nougat was made lighter, the chocolate on top became thinner, and the overall weight of the bar was reduced slightly. The slogan \"Pleasure you can't measure\" was intended to appeal more to women and youths.\n\nVarious sizes are made (sizes as of 2008): miniature bars called \"Fun Size\" (19.7 g) and \"Snack Time\" (36.5 g) (both sold in multiple packs); a larger multi-pack size of 54 g; the regular sized single 58 g bar and a \"king-size\" 84 g bar which has since been replaced by \"Mars Duo\" (85 g) – a pack that contains 2 smaller bars of 42.5 g each instead of 1 large one. The regular 58 g single bar contains 260 calories.\n\nIn the second half of 2008, Mars UK reduced the weight of regular bars from 62.5 g to 58 g. Although the reduction in size was not publicised at the time, Mars claimed the change was designed to help tackle the obesity crisis in the UK. The company later confirmed that the real reason for the change was rising costs. In 2013, the \"standard\" Mars bar was further reduced to 51 g, bringing the change to around 20% in 5 years.\n\nIn the UK, most Mars bars are still made at the Slough Trading Estate.\n\nThe worldwide Mars bar differs from that sold in the US. The American version was discontinued in 2002 and was replaced with the slightly different Snickers Almond featuring nougat, almonds, and a milk chocolate coating. Like the later recipe changes to the American Mars bar, Snickers Almond also contains caramel. The US version of the Mars bar was relaunched in January 2010 and was initially being sold on an exclusive basis through Walmart stores. The European version of the Mars bar is also sold in some United States grocery stores. The US version was once again discontinued at the end of 2011. In September 2016, Ethel M Chocolates, a gourmet chocolate subsidiary of Mars, Inc. launched the 'original American recipe' of the Mars Bar in their stores and on Amazon.com. Unlike Snickers Almond and later incarnations of the American Mars bar, this bar does not contain caramel.\n\nThe Canadian Mars Bars, as with all Mars Bars outside the USA, are very similar to the United States Milky Way bar, which Mars, Inc. also produces (not to be confused with the European version of Milky Way, which is similar to the United States' 3 Musketeers).\n\nIn May 2009 the Mars Bar size reduced from 60g to 53g, citing portion sizes and the obesity debate as the primary driver.\n\nWithin Australia there is debate regarding halal certification. Also within the Muslim community there is debate on the virtue of halal certification for products such as Mars bars.\n\nSeveral variants of Mars bars have been released in various countries, either as limited edition or permanent releases. They include:\n\n\nOther products have also been released using the Mars branding.\n\n\nThe Original Mars bar in \"Believe\" packaging was sold in the UK from 18 April 2006 until the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in July. \"Believe\" took prominence on the packaging (\"Original Mars\" appeared in smaller print) to indicate support for the England national football team. Advertising in other nations of the UK was tailored to reflect their own teams after the public condemnation, although in Scotland the \"Believe\" packaging was still used – causing negative publicity.\n\nOn 30 July 2008, the Tasmanian government announced that it had secured a major sponsor, Mars for a bid to enter the Australian Football League in a deal worth $4 million over 3 years and will temporarily change the name of its top-selling chocolate bar in Australia to Believe, to help promote Tasmania's cause.\n\nMars were re-branded \"Hopp\" (engl. \"Go!\") in Switzerland during UEFA Euro 2008. Like the \"Believe\" packaging sold in the UK in 2006, \"Original Mars\" was also shown in smaller print.\n\nIn 2010, to promote England's involvement in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the background of the UK Mars packaging became the St. George cross.\n\n\n\nThis is a Mars bar which has been coated with batter and deep-fried in oil or beef fat. First reports of battered Mars bars being sold in Stonehaven, Scotland date back to 1995. The product is \"not authorised or endorsed\" by Mars, Inc.\n\nDeep-fried Mars bars are available from some fish-and-chip shops in the UK (mainly in Scotland), Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland and the United States.\n\nA similar dish has appeared in Kathmandu, Nepal where momo (dumplings) have used Mars bars as fillings.\n\nOn July 2005, Mars bars, along with the Snickers bar, were recalled due to an anonymous extortion attempt against Star City Casino in Sydney. The extortionist claimed to have poisoned seven Mars and Snickers bars at random stores in New South Wales. As a result, Masterfoods Corporation, the company that manufactures Mars bars in Australia, recalled the entire Mars and Snickers product from store shelves in New South Wales. Nineteen people were possibly affected, with two being admitted to hospital. In the later half of August 2005, the threat to the public was deemed negligible and the bars returned to shelves.\n\nIn February 2016, Mars, Snickers and various other Mars, Inc. chocolate products were recalled in 55 countries in Europe, Middle East and Asia. The precautionary recall was issued after a customer found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar purchased in Germany. The error was traced back to a Mars, Inc. factory in Veghel, The Netherlands.\n\nIn May 2007 Mars UK announced that Mars bars, along with many of their other products such as Snickers, Maltesers, Minstrels and Twix would no longer be suitable for vegetarians because of the introduction of rennet, a chemical sourced from calves' stomachs used in the production of whey.\n\nThe rabbinical authorities declared that the products remained kosher for Jewish consumption.\n\nThe decision was condemned by several groups, with the Vegetarian Society stating that \"at a time when more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food, Mars' decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step\".\n\nMars later abandoned these plans, stating that it became \"very clear, very quickly\" that it had made a mistake.\n\nIt has been observed on several occasions that the price of a Mars bar correlates fairly accurately with the change in value of the pound sterling since World War II, much in the way that the Big Mac Index has proven to be a good indicator of the actual relative purchasing power of world currencies.\n\n"}
{"id": "247659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247659", "title": "Schaefer Beer", "text": "Schaefer Beer\n\nSchaefer Beer is a brand of American beer first produced in New York City during 1842 by the F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Company. The company relocated to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. It went public in 1968 with a $106 million stock offering.\n\nIn order to expand capacity for regional sales and fend off competition from national brands Schaefer began construction of a large modern brewery in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania that same year. Known as the Lehigh Valley Plant it opened in 1972. In 1974 it was expanded from its original 1,100,000 barrels-per-year capacity to 2,500,000 and then, in 1975, it expanded again to 5,000,000 barrels plus.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Schaefer Beer was one of the top selling beers in the U.S., ranking as high as fifth in both the 1950 and 1970 rankings. Though it was producing more than twice as much beer in 1980 the gap between it and the top national brands was dramatically widening. In 1981 the Schaefer family sold the company to the Stroh Brewery Company in 1981.\n\nStroh's then took over the Allentown plant in its own bid for national market share. It operated the plant until absorbed by Pabst Brewing Company in 1999. When Pabst opted to become a \"virtual brewer\" it sold the plant to Diageo just two years later. In 2008 Diageo sold it to the Boston Brewing Company, brewer of Samuel Adams beer.\n\nPabst retained the license to Schaefer and today outsources a reformulated brew it labels \"Schaefer\" and sells in niche markets in the United States.\n\nThe advertising slogan for Schaefer beer is the jingle \"Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one.\" An earlier advertising campaign from the 1950s asserted, \"What do you hear in the best of circles? Schaefer, all around!\" In Spanish, Schaefer's slogan was \"Es la mejor, cuando se toma mas de una!\" (which translates to \"It is the best, when you are having more than one!\")\n\nSchaefer beer had major exhibitions at both of New York City's World's Fairs, held in Flushing Meadows Park. During both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New York World's Fair, Schaefer sponsored \"Schaefer Center\", a restaurant that used beer as an ingredient in many dishes.\n\nSchaefer was the official beer sponsor of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1951 until the franchise's departure for Los Angeles following the 1957 season. During that span, one of its advertisement was featured at the top of Ebbets Field's scoreboard on the right-field wall. The letters \"h\" and \"e\" on the wordmark lit up depending on whether the official scorer ruled that a batter reached base on a hit or an error respectively.\n\nFoxboro Stadium, the home stadium of the New England Patriots from 1971-2001, was originally named Schaefer Stadium after the beer company paid naming rights for the privilege, one of the earliest known examples of a stadium selling naming rights. After 12 years, the contract expired and the name was changed to Sullivan Stadium in 1983 (after the family that owned the team).\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Schaefer beer was one of the top selling beers in Puerto Rico and Guam. A large and quite famous Schaefer beer billboard was once displayed at the main entrance to the city of Bayamón. Schaefer still upholds the record for being the beer with the most unit sales in Puerto Rico, 13 million cases in a year, in the year 1979-80. It became quite famous among Puerto Rican salsa fans and superstars like Frankie Ruiz, Tito Rojas, and Lalo Rodríguez.\n\n"}

{"id": "248705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248705", "title": "Hòa Hảo", "text": "Hòa Hảo\n\nĐạo Hòa Hảo (, Chữ Nôm: ), also Hoahaoism, is a lay-Buddhist organization, founded in 1939 by Huỳnh Phú Sổ (Popularly called Phật thầy, \"Buddha Master\" in Vietnamese), a native of the Mekong River Delta region of southern Vietnam. Adherents consider Sổ to be a prophet, and Hòa Hảo a continuation of a 19th-century Buddhist ministry known as Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương (Sino-Vietnamese ). The founders of these traditions are regarded by Hòa Hảo followers as living Buddhas—destined to save mankind from suffering and to protect the Vietnamese nation. Hòa Hảo claims approximately two million followers throughout Vietnam; in some provinces near its Delta birthplace, as many as 90 percent of the population practice this tradition. An important characteristic of this movement is its emphasis on peasant farmers, exemplified by the old slogan, \"Practicing Buddhism While Farming Your Land\". Hòa Hảo stresses the practice of Buddhism by lay people in the home, rather than focusing primarily on temple worship and ordination. Aid to the poor is favored over pagoda-building or expensive rituals; religious and social ceremonies are ideally simple and modest, and are not to include the food offerings, divination services, and elaborate wedding and funeral customs found in some manifestations of Southeast Asian life. These are viewed as a waste of money which would be better spent helping the needy. \n\nIn Hòa Hảo homes, a plain brown cloth serves as an altar, at which the family prays morning and night. Separate altars are used to honor ancestors and the sacred directions. Only fresh water, flowers, and incense are used in worship; no bells or gongs accompany prayers. A believer away from home at prayer times faces west (i.e., toward India) to pray to the Buddha. Adherents are expected to attend communal services on the 1st and 15th of each lunar month and on other Buddhist holy days. \n\nHuỳnh Phú Sổ faced a great deal of trouble when he began to spread the ideas of his religion, a large part of which was Vietnamese nationalism, a dangerous idea in that time of French colonial rule. He was put in an asylum because of his preaching, but supposedly converted his doctor to the Hòa Hảo belief. As the popularity of Hòa Hảo grew, Huỳnh Phú Sổ made a series of prophecies about the political future of Vietnam. He said that the \"true king\" would return to lead Vietnam to freedom and prosperity, which caused most Hòa Hảo to support the Nguyễn pretender: Marquis Cường Để, living abroad in Japan. \n\nDuring World War II, the Hòa Hảo supported the Japanese occupation and planned for Cường Để to become Emperor of Vietnam. However, this never happened and the Hòa Hảo came into conflict with the communists both because the Việt Minh were anti-Japanese and because of their Marxist opposition to all religion. During the State of Vietnam (1949–1955), they made arrangements with the Head of State Bảo Đại, much like those made by the Cao Đài religion and the Bình Xuyên gang, which were in control of their own affairs in return for their nominal support of the Bảo Đại regime. In fact, the control of this government by France meant that most Hòa Hảo opposed it.\n\nDuring the early years of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, An Giang Province and its capital Long Xuyên were among the few places in the Mekong Delta where Viet Cong activity was minimal and American and South Vietnamese troops could move without fear of sniper attack. After the war, the Hòa Hảo were allowed to remain, but like all religions, under strict Communist control.\n\nThe Buu Son Ky Huong religion was described by its adherents as \"committed to the world\". The basis of the Buu Son Ky Huong religion was the Buddha Master's claim to be a messenger from Heaven who had come into the world to warn mankind of the imminence of apocalypse. The key to this cult was simplicity, flexibility, and frugality. No one could plead lack of means or difficult circumstances as a justification for not carrying out his own religious duties and for relying instead on monks, but these duties were kept to a minimum. The Buddha\nMaster's advocacy of ritual frugality probably attracted many poor peasants by allowing them to turn practical necessity into religious virtue. Because of the overwhelmingly domestic nature of the cult, the French observer Georges Coulet called it in 1926 the \" Third Buddhist Order, \" explaining that it was neither monastic nor congregational but mostly lay. However, he observed, there were days when adepts were expected to gather in pagodas that belonged to the sect: \" This cult is sensibly a Buddhist cult. It consists of the observance of fasts and abstinences, of the daily recitation of prayers, of invocations which must be said at certain hours of the day or night: it imposes visits to mountain pagodas on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months of the Annamite year. Fasts and abstinences can be once a month, once every two months, once a week, once every two weeks, or perpetual . . . Offices are celebrated thrice a day: at dawn, noon, and dusk. At these times, candles are lit on the altar, and joss-sticks are placed in the incense-burner; the caretaker of the temple gives several strokes of the\nbell and the faithful perform several prostrations in front of the altar, bowing their heads to the ground. Prayers are said in low voice; a few beads are recited. Finally, in exchange for a contribution in money or goods, amulets are distributed by a monk of the pagoda; these amulets preserve from death, illness, and misfortune.\n\nThe founder of the Hoa Hao was Huynh Phu So, who took for the name of his sect the village of Hoa Hao, in the Thot Not District of what is now An Giang Province. So's background is not completely known; but most authorities agree that he was a mystic who saw a vision instructing him to launch a new religion. He organised his sect in 1930, declared himself a prophet, and began to preach a doctrine based on simplicity and faith. Within a year, he had gathered a following of over 100,000 converts; and through his preaching, he established contact with another two million people in the Mien Tay region.\n\nHuynh Phu So taught that each member of the sect could achieve direct communion with the Lord Buddha, and that internal faith was more important than external ceremony. Moreover, the care of the living has priority over the welfare of the dead. Huynh Phu So restated that the doctrine was lay-oriented, and he advocated the reduction of cultic expenses not only in the practice of Buddhism but also on all ceremonial occasions. He attacked the custom of overspending at the New Year, of bankrupting one's family at funerals and weddings, and of trying to outdo one's neighbors in conspicuous consumption. It was wrong to conceive of religious piety as something separate from the rest of life, as a set of exercises that were to be performed on an occasional basis. Huynh Phu So's stated objective was to \"combine the ideal of universal love and charity with a new method of organizing society in order to serve better our people and mankind.” But he had no real understanding of the workings of a complex social system and therefore could not evolve a strategy for bringing about the new order of things, except through the violent expansion of his sect. Huynh Phu So embroidered the idea that money is the source of evil, both for those who had not enough and for those who had too much. \n\nWhile Huynh Phu So is regarded by most commentators as a traditionalist, and indeed many of his teachings support such an interpretation, he also had a well-defined modernizing vision, evident, for example in his imprecation against superstition.\n\nNo Vietnamese leader of the time possessed personal charisma to quite the same degree as Huynh Phu So. A measure of Huynh Phu So's powers of persuasion is that he made his mark as a healer despite his own well-publicised ill-health. Throughout his career, healing remained an important feature of his work; a substantial number of pamphlets describing the herbal remedies employed by Huynh Phu So still exist. So divided diseases into two categories: those that were the result of ordinary ill-fortune, and those that were the result of karmic retribution. The latter was not amenable to treatment; only repentance could alleviate it. Each of these new recruits were people of little education, interested in action rather than in doctrinal or political questions. They put themselves entirely at the service of Huynh Phu So. By August 1940, the Can Tho authorities were alarmed by their activities and by the destabilizing influence of Huynh Phu So. He was summoned for a psychiatric examination at Can Tho hospital. Huynh Phu So was taken to Cho Quan hospital in Cho Lon and put under the care of a Vietnamese doctor named Nguyen van Tam. The latter's verdict was more charitable: \"This monk has never presented signs of agitation or insanity. He is mentally weak, with a disharmony of the intellectual faculties.\" In spite of being considered \"mentally weak,\" So converted several of the hospital wardens and, more important, his own doctor. For a man who had never had any qualms about being called the Mad Monk, this was a resounding triumph which the\nsect exploited to the full. The doctor became a devoted follower of Huynh Phu So, until he was assassinated by the Viet Minh in 1948. In May 1945 Huynh Phu So issued a pamphlet called \"Guidelines for the Practice of Religion\" (Ton Chi Hanh Dao), in which he codified Hoa Hao cultic practices and for the first time imposed rules on admission into the sect. His adepts were exhorted to uphold the Three Bonds: between ruler and subject (transmuted into patriotism), father and son, and husband and wife. They were to observe the Five Virtues of benevolence, loyalty, propriety, intelligence, and integrity. Above all, they were to live in accord with one another. Whatever the usefulness of such a code of ethics in a modern, industrial society, it was quite effective within the confines of the average Hoa Hao village. Among themselves, the adepts relied on trust and did not bother to put doors on their houses to guard their belongings.\n\nHuynh Phu So was invited to a unity conference at a Viet Minh stronghold in the Plain of Reeds. On the way, he was led into a trap in which he and his escort were assassinated. The Viet Minh quartered his body and scattered it to prevent the Hoa Hao from recovering his remains and building a martyr's shrine. This rash and barbarous act resulted in a rupture incapable of subsequent reconciliation. The Hoa Hao vowed to wage eternal war against the Communists. \n\nHoa Hao religion combines the two kinds of Buddhism into one orientation: prescribing that all should strive to become monks for life but doing so at home and supporting themselves rather than turning into a caste of specialists permanently dependent on the community. The proscription on displaying Buddha statues on the household altar is borrowed from Islam’s proscription on the worship of images. The presence of a significant Islamic community in the local area has an impact on the Hoa Hao religion. A large community of ethnic Cham converts to Islam live in close proximity to Hoa Hao village. The surrounding area is full of mosques and its residents number many devout Muslims. Huynh Phu So, the founder of the Hoa Hao went to school in Tan Chau, in a heavily Muslim area. The influences are evident in the Hoa Hao’s religious practices; doctrine and architecture; the approach to prayer and preaching houses. A number of the towers, such as the one located by the Mekong River in Tan Chau town, have ornate sculpted decorations in an Islamic style and domed roofs. The Hoa Hao religion has been open to a range of different influences, including Marxism and US-style modernization ideology. For example, the combination of nationalist sentiments with the cult of heroes, the concept of a supreme being and US civic religion is found in this statement made by a contributor to a Hoa Hao Buddhist journal in the USA on the prospects for the democratization of Vietnam: I am praying to a higher power and to the sacred soul of the land, to the souls of heroes who have fallen on behalf of their beliefs and for the defense of the nation, so that they can prod and move and defeat this wave of atheism which is currently washing over Vietnam so that our people can welcome the light of Freedom and Democracy.\n\nReturn of the French colonial regime was a major disappointment to the Hoa Hao, as it was to Vietnamese nationalists of all political persuasions. Huynh Phu So had hoped that his sect would become the de facto ruling power throughout most of Cochinchina. But the return of the French in strength too numerous for the Hoa Hao \"army\" to oppose effectively put a temporary end to such hopes. The Hoa Hao turned their attention inward, both to solidify their sectarian strength and to increase their political influence in the Delta. The French, becoming increasingly distrustful of the Viet Minh, soon gave the Hoa Hao territorial hegemony in the southwestern Delta. Huynh Phu So for his part was willing to engage in alliances with the colonialists in return for support against the Viet Minh. Eventually the French provided arms for some 20,000 Hoa Hao troops. Such an accommodation was not considered by the Hoa Hao as a betrayal of their nationalist goals, because the ultimate aim of sectarian independence was not compromised. The Hoa Hao had long been suspicious of the National Front and the Viet Minh, and had actively fought the latter for years. The shift in loyalty from the colonialists to the National Front movement did not represent a major break for the Hoa Hao. As in their prior maneuverings, their action was primarily a move to solidify their own control of the western Delta. Strengthened by French armaments, the Hoa Hao now turned against the French because they were convinced that colonial rule in Vietnam was destined to be ended by Asians. The Hoa Hao were certain that the French could and would be forced out of Indochina in the not-too-distinct future. But the Hoa Hao \"alliance\" with the Viet Minh was short-lived. It soon became clear that religious autonomy and the attendant political freedom demanded by the Hoa Hao were incompatible with Viet Minh plans. Before long, Huynh Phu So was preaching with growing frenzy against the Viet Minh, which he now perceived as an even greater threat to the sect than the French. The struggle with the Viet Minh became a fanatical religious war. So preached that any Hoa Hao killing ten Viet Minh would have a straight pathway to heaven. Although the Hoa Hao had an \"army\" of four combat battalions, they were eventually defeated by Saigon's much larger forces. The final Saigon victories in 1962 signaled the end of the independent Hao Hao army. But despite military defeat at the hands of Saigon, the Hoa Hao continued to maintain their religious and political hold over the territory west of the Bassac River and the Delta capital city of Can Tho. They also held onto their arms, and organized militia forces to defend the geographical heartland of the movement. The Hoa Hao were too strong a force to allow the Saigon government the luxury of continued political or religious warfare. As a result, the Hoa Hao were thereafter left alone, and won tacit permission to maintain a kind of sovereignty in the Transbassac. In return, the Hoa Hao recognized the authority of the Saigon regime. No longer forced to devote their military forces to the struggle against the central government, they were able to resume their feud with the Communists. The Hoa Hao took full advantage of this new-found independence to wage total war against the Communists, now known as the Viet Cong. While political influence was welcome, the Hoa Hao had also achieved their primary goal-religious independence. Being a Hoa Hao was no longer a bar to participation in government, and the sect was no longer subject to religious discrimination by the orthodox Buddhist hierarchy. But it was the military strength of the Hoa Hao that gave the sect its strongest lever of influence, and its ability to provide a high degree of local security in the provinces it controlled. Huynh Phu So insisted on being referred to by his proper name of So and on using for his sect the name of his native village of Hoa Hao which meant \"peace and plenty.\" He would no longer be one of many healers and preachers but the prophet of a distinct religious movement with its own name, built on the Buu Son Ky Huong tradition rather than simply part of it. \n\nThe sect expanded rapidly under Japanese protection. Even though Huynh Phu So was unable to leave Saigon, his apostles recruited on his behalf, using the familiar mixture of doom-laden predictions and veiled threats against those who did not join and distributing cures and amulets. By 1943, the Hoa Hao sect was thus moving in the direction of greater institutionalization. The death of Huynh Phu So thus marked the end of the Hoa Hao millenarianism and the beginning of purely communal politics. Within the Hoa Hao communities, the preachers of old were replaced by lay administrators who were elected and unpaid. Healing was now the province of a health service operated free of charge by the sect. Evangelizing took the form of religious and academic education. The sect opened schools at all levels, and in the early 1970s it even established a university. Western technology in fact provided the sect with a new tool of mass indoctrination when the focus of Hoa Hao village life, the reading-room, was connected to a public-address system. The sayings of Patriarch Huynh were thus broadcast daily over loudspeakers. Charity also became organized: the sect offered relief for veterans and prisoners, for victims of floods and fire, for old people and orphans. Life in Hoa Hao villages continued to be led along simple lines. The adepts were guided by Huynh Phu So's teachings concerning cultic practices and daily conduct, and they kept the number of ceremonies low and the expenses connected with them minimal. Neither adepts nor leaders were particularly interested any longer in promoting radical change or even in pursuing the violent expansion of the sect. Their energies were now devoted to the preservation of the communitarian style of life which was the other Buu Son Ky Huong ideal. But communitarianism proved ill-suited to the social complexities of an urban environment. Furthermore, the adepts are virtually leaderless. The establishment of the sectarian infrastructure helped preserve their cohesion, but the corollary de-emphasis on charisma made it harder to mobilize the collectivity of the adepts into action.\n\nThe Hoa Hao works images of globes into their iconography which is an aesthetic expression of universalism reflecting an imagining of the spatial condition as global. This symbol has a mnemonic function as one of the four injunctions of the Hoa Hao faith is to recognize one’s debt to humanity. Yet it is also a reminder to followers that the propagation of the Hoa Hao faith is considered a sacred mission in order to reform mankind. This value is also reinforced in the prescribed color for the altar cloth and flag, which is brown. As brown is considered the combination of all colors, it is used to symbolize human harmony and the connectedness and interdependence of all people. Hoa Hao Buddhism is generally considered an apocalyptic religion: believers are held to anticipate the impending destruction of the world and seek refuge provided by faith. This illuminates the history of violence in which the Hoa Hao have been involved.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Hoa Hao religion is the preservation of their religious identity and independence. Temporary alliances with past enemies were formed only as a means of survival and to gain strength for the future. Originally concerned only with religious autonomy, the Hoa Hao became a nationalist anti-French movement before World War II; then increasingly anti-Communist as it struggled for supremacy with the Viet Minh; then overtly pro-Japanese for purely tactical reasons. With the end of the war, the Hoa Hao joined with their old enemy, the French colonialists, to strengthen themselves against a more serious foe, the Viet Minh. But the ultimate goal of the movement was always to control its own destiny without interference from any outside source. \n\nThe earliest followers of the Hoa Hao were not just landless peasants impoverished by capitalism but small holders and there are those who work in transport, light industry and trade. The leaders of the Hoa Hao faith were recruited from schoolteachers, itinerant drivers and motor coach and river launch conductors, people on the nodes of the most important communicative pathways of colonial society. Today, some of the most cosmopolitan people in the delta, boat captains, traders, café owners and physicians, belong to this religion. Taylor has found members of the faith, like many residents of the Mekong delta, to have wide horizons. They are informed about and engaged with current developments, interested in news of the outside world, focused on social work, improving the physical infrastructure of their locale and the building of a moral community. \n\nOf a less revolutionary order of activity, members of the faith are also very active in health care provision, community development activities and philanthropy. Such activities in accordance with the Master’s injunction to social engagement represent a viable and promising basis for the Hoa Hao to secure broader political support.\n\nThe Hòa Hảo followers with whom Taylor spoke consider their home at the epicentre of world Buddhism, the Buddha having re-incarnated as Huynh Phu So. Many believe that Hoa Hao Buddhism spread from Vietnam to the rest of the world, following his overseas travels. In each land he visited the creed has been adapted to the local customs and is called by a different name. Today many members of the Hoa Hao still consider themselves engaged in a desperate struggle for survival, Some ofollowers with whom Taylor spoke in Vietnam believed that the religion has recently secured limited recognition because of the large number of Hoa Hao believers who are in the local party and state administration quietly pushing for change. \n\nAlthough Hòa Hảo Buddhism is an officially recognized religion in Vietnam, many members refuse the forceful governmental affiliation which is entailed by official recognition and an unknown number of religious leaders have been detained for this reason. Two Hòa Hảo Buddhists self-immolated in 2005 to protest against religious persecution and more recently, after a wave of arrests of Hòa Hảo Buddhists, nine more were imprisoned in May 2007. Hòa Hảoists reportedly do not believe their founder died under torture. They surmise that he is still among the living. In 2007, the Vietnamese government had the printed prophesies of the founder seized and reprinted to a volume slightly more than half the original size. The ceremonies commemorating the birth of this prophet were outlawed. Since then, Hòa Hảo split into two factions – more and less militant.\n\nSome Hòa Hảo adherents migrated to the United States. The largest number of Hòa Hảo-ists live in Santa Ana, California, USA.\n\nHoa Hao claim to have faced restrictions on their religious and political activities after 1975, in part because of their previous armed opposition to Communist forces. A tentative easing of control on the religion began in 1999. There were, however, crackdowns in the face of demands that the government speed up this process. In 2001 there were again serious protests and arrests; a female member of the religion reportedly committed self-immolation to protest against restrictions on religious freedom\n\nHoa Hao Buddhism draws upon an earlier Buddhist millenarian movement called Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương and reveres Đoàn Minh Huyên (Nov. 14th, 1807 - Sept 10, 1856) who started the movement as a living, healing Buddha. He is referred to as Phật Thầy Tây An or \"Buddha Master of the Western Peace\". However, the founder of Hoa Hao Buddhism, Huynh Phu So, also organized Hoa Hao teachings into a more structured movement focused on self-cultivation, filial piety and reverence toward the Three Treasures of Buddhism (the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha).\n\nAs a lay-Buddhist organization primarily focused on Vietnamese peasants, it also eschews elaborate Buddhist rituals, maintains no monastic order, and teaches home practice.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "249206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249206", "title": "T-bone steak", "text": "T-bone steak\n\nThe T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries and Ireland). Both steaks include a \"T\"-shaped lumbar vertebrae with sections of abdominal internal oblique muscle on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.\n\nThere is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The United States Department of Agriculture's \"Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications\" state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least thick (i.e. measuring from the bone) at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least wide. However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \"T-bone\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse.\n\nOwing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.\n\nIn the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173.\n\nIn British usage, followed in the Commonwealth countries, \"porterhouse\" often means a British sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone. However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, a Porterhouse is striploin steak off the bone.\n\nThe origin of the term \"porterhouse\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \"Porter House\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale. This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century. Some sources contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef. In that era (late 18th to early 20th century), Porter Square was flanked by cattle yards that used the Porter rail head to transport their beef throughout the US. Still others claim the steak takes its name from various other 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.\n\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\n\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.\n\n\"Bistecca alla fiorentina\", or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \"Bistecca\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.\n\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for \"Cotoletta alla milanese\", which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.\n\n\n"}

It reappeared in 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was being translated from English into Māori. It was used there to translate the concept of sovereignty. Some historians believe that there was no existing suitable word in the Māori language at the time; however, many Māori believe that the word mana would have provided appropriate meaning. One supposition is that if mana had been used instead of the new, transliterated kāwana tanga, the treaty would never had been signed. \n\nThe first part of the word, \"Kāwana\", is a transliteration into Māori of the English word \"governor\". The suffix \"-tanga\" is very similar in meaning and use to the English suffix \"-ship\", for example \"rangatiratanga\" (chieftainship) and \"kīngitanga\" (kingship). So a literal translation of the word would be \"governorship\". From an idiomatic perspective, this word had little meaning to the chiefs signing the treaty, since the concept of being governed by an overseeing authority was alien to Māori. What understanding Maori may have had of the term was derived principally from the Bible and in particular Herod's Governorship. At the time the bible was one of few long printed texts in Maori enjoying wide distribution.\n\nThe meaning attached to this word, and in particular how it relates to \"rangatiratanga\" is vital to discussion of the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is still vitally important in modern New Zealand, and remains the object of much controversy and political debate. Māori constitutional lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that, because the New Zealand government (identified as \"Kawanatanga\" in the Treaty text) is the body politic enforcing the Treaty and making settlements, \"Kawanatanga\" is the actual party to the Treaty, not the Crown.\n"}
{"id": "250937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250937", "title": "Finlandia (vodka)", "text": "Finlandia (vodka)\n\nFinlandia is a vodka produced in Finland from Finnish-grown six-row barley and glacial spring water. The barley is distilled into a neutral spirit using a continuous multi-pressure distillation system at a distillery in the village of Koskenkorva operated by Finland’s Altia Corporation. The distilled alcohol is then transported to a production facility in the village of Rajamäki, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Helsinki. In Rajamäki, the spirit is blended with glacial water, flavored (except for the classic non-flavored edition, 101 and Platinum), and bottled.\n\nThe Finlandia brand was established in 1970 by Alko, Finland’s state-owned alcoholic beverage company. \n\nFinlandia is now owned by the Brown-Forman Corporation. Finlandia vodka is distributed in 135 countries and is widely associated with Finland on the international market. Flavors include cranberry (since 1994), lime (1999), mango (2004), red berry (2004), wild berries (2005), grapefruit (2006), tangerine (2009) and blackcurrant (2009).\n\nThe distillery that produces Finlandia vodka was founded in 1888 by Dr. Wilhelm Juslin next to the glacial spring in the small Finnish village of Rajamäki. Today, a facility at that same historic location still manufactures and packages Finlandia.\n\nIn 1920, after the passage of the alcohol Prohibition Act in Finland, the Rajamäki distillery was bought by the Finnish state to secure an alcohol supply for pharmacies and for other non-beverage purposes. When the Prohibition Act was lifted in 1932, the state took over exclusive control of vodka production.\n\nIn 1970, Alko, the state-owned alcoholic beverage company, established the Finlandia vodka brand name. A year later the Finlandia brand became the first Scandinavian vodka sold in the United States, as well as the first imported vodka brand there classified in a premium category.\n\nIn 1975, a new alcoholic beverage plant was constructed at the Rajamaki location in Finland, and the distilling operation was centralized at the Koskenkorva facility in 1987.\n\nIn 2000, the private U.S.-based Brown-Forman Corporation acquired 45% of Finlandia Vodka Worldwide, with the state-owned Altia Group, a successor of Alko, retaining 55% ownership. Two years later Brown-Forman acquired an additional 35% stake in Finlandia Vodka. In 2004, Brown-Forman acquired the remaining 20% of Finlandia Vodka and assumed 100% ownership in the brand.\n\nAs of 2016 Brown-Foreman is considering a sale of Finlandia Vodka in an effort to focus on its whiskey business.\n\nFinlandia vodka is produced from Finnish-grown six-row barley and pure glacial spring water.\n\nAt the Koskenkorva facility in western Finland, initial distillation of the fermented six-row barley takes place in seven columns with an average height of 25 meters using Altia’s multi-pressure distilling system. Any remaining impurities, including lethal methanol as well as fusel alcohols and oils, are removed as the grain spirit is moved in a continuous process through more than 200 distillation steps. The entire production process, from grain mashing until the final neutral spirit flows out of the column, takes approximately 50 hours.\n\nThe final product, a grain spirit 96.5% by volume, is then transported about 315 kilometers (196 miles) south to the historic alcoholic beverage plant in the village of Rajamäki near Helsinki. The barley distillate is diluted with glacial water from the Rajamäki spring. Because the water is naturally filtered through sand and moraine formed by retreating glaciers during the Ice Age, no deionization, osmosis treatment or other artificial purification is used — unlike with some other vodkas\n\nThe cooling and heating water used throughout the process is recirculated in a closed system to efficiently control temperature and keep water use to a minimum.\n\nFinlandia is available in pure form (distilled alcohol + water) and in several flavored versions.\nDuring the past several decades, the marketing of Finlandia vodka has involved a number of global promotional campaigns.\n\nFrozen Ice \"(1970)\" Tapio Wirkkala designed the original “Frozen Ice” bottle, which conveyed the impression of an ice-cold drink from Lapland in the Arctic North. The textured glass glittered like the surface of an icicle. The label featured two white reindeers sparring against the Midnight Sun low on the horizon.\n\nHammered Ice \"(1998)\" Hansen Design of Design Philadelphia introduced “Hammered Ice” bottle design. The paper label was dropped and replaced with lacquered text.\n\nGlacial Ice \"(2003)\" Harri Koskinen, Finnish tabletop glass and industrial designer, along with New York’s Wallace Church & Co. graphic designers and the Finlandia Global package design team, designed and launched the “Glacial Ice” bottle. The texture mimicked the sensation of melting ice, capturing the origins of the brand’s glacial spring water.\n\nMelting Ice \"(2011)\" Finlandia introduced a new bottle called “Melting Ice”. The bottle was developed through the collective effort of designers including Harri Koskinen, the Finnish designer who was instrumental in the development of the prior Finlandia bottle, and Kenneth Hirst, an industrial designer based in New York, who sculpted the new form.\n\n"}

It was first sold in 1928, advertised as \"the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped\". This led to the popular phrase \"greatest thing since sliced bread\".\n\nOtto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa, United States, invented the first single loaf bread-slicing machine. A prototype he built in 1912 was destroyed in a fire and it was not until 1928 that Rohwedder had a fully working machine ready. The first commercial use of the machine was by the Chillicothe Baking Company of Chillicothe, Missouri, which sold their first slices on July 7, 1928. Their product, \"Kleen Maid Sliced Bread\", proved to be a success. Battle Creek, Michigan, has a competing claim as the first city to sell bread sliced by Rohwedder's machine; however, historians have produced no documentation backing up Battle Creek's claim. The bread was advertised as \"the greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped.\"\n\nSt. Louis baker Gustav Papendick bought Rohwedder's second bread slicer and set out to improve it by devising a way to keep the slices together at least long enough to allow the loaves to be wrapped. After failures trying rubber bands and metal pins, he settled on placing the slices into a cardboard tray. The tray aligned the slices, allowing mechanized wrapping machines to function.\n\nW.E. Long, who promoted the Holsum Bread brand, used by various independent bakers around the country, pioneered and promoted the packaging of sliced bread beginning in 1928. In 1930 Wonder Bread, first sold in 1925, started marketing sliced bread nationwide.\n\nAs commercially sliced bread resulted in uniform and somewhat thinner slices, people ate more slices of bread at a time. They also ate bread more frequently, because of the ease of getting and eating another piece of bread. This increased consumption of bread and, in turn, increased consumption of spreads, such as jam, to put on the bread.\n\nDuring 1943, U.S. officials imposed a short-lived ban on sliced bread as a wartime conservation measure. The ban was ordered by Claude R. Wickard who held the position of Food Administrator, and took effect on January 18, 1943. According to \"The New York Times\", officials explained that \"the ready-sliced loaf must have a heavier wrapping than an unsliced one if it is not to dry out.\" It was also intended to counteract a rise in the price of bread, caused by the Office of Price Administration's authorization of a ten percent increase in flour prices.\n\nIn a Sunday radio address on January 24, New York City Mayor LaGuardia suggested that bakeries that had their own bread-slicing machines should be allowed to continue to use them, and on January 26, 1943, a letter appeared in \"The New York Times\" from a distraught housewife:\n\nI should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale and saneness of a household. My husband and four children are all in a rush during and after breakfast. Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing for toast—two pieces for each one—that's ten. For their lunches I must cut by hand at least twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece. Afterward I make my own toast. Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry!\n\nOn January 26, however, John F. Conaboy, the New York Area Supervisor of the Food Distribution Administration, warned bakeries, delicatessens, and other stores that were continuing to slice bread to stop, saying that \"to protect the cooperating bakeries against the unfair competition of those who continue to slice their own bread... we are prepared to take stern measures if necessary.\"\n\nOn March 8, 1943, the ban was rescinded. While public outcry is generally credited for the reversal, Wickard stated that \"Our experience with the order, however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected, and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry.\"\n\nDue to its convenience, sliced bread is popular in many parts of the world, and the usual thickness varies by company and country:\n\n\nThe phrase \"\"the greatest thing since sliced bread\"\" is a common hyperbole used to praise an invention or development. A writer for \"The Kansas City Star\" wrote that \"the phrase is the ultimate depiction of innovative achievement and American know-how.\"\n\nIn 1940, a package of bread consisting of two wrapped half-loaves was advertised as the \"greatest convenience since sliced bread\".\n\n\n"}

However, when he attempted to bottle a chocolate drink, he found that it would soon spoil. Observing his wife canning fruits and vegetables, he asked her to use the same heat processing techniques with his chocolate drink. He began bottling the pasteurized chocolate drink named Yoo-Hoo at 133 Farnham Avenue in 1928. \nIn the 1940s, Thomas Giresi opened a bottling plant in Batesburg, South Carolina, for distribution of Yoo-hoo. In the 1960s, an advertising campaign tried to appeal to an older public for the drink, and featured Yogi Berra and his New York Yankees teammates. Berra, in a pin-striped business suit, drinks a bottle of Yoo-hoo, lifts it next to his cheek, and says with a smile, \"It's Me-He for Yoo-Hoo!\"\n\nBBC Industries purchased the rights to Yoo-hoo sometime in the 1950s and retained ownership until 1976, when it sold the brand to Iroquois Brands. Yoo-hoo was sold again in 1981 to a group of private investors, which owned the brand until 1989, when it was sold to the French conglomerate Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn 2001, Pernod Ricard sold Yoo-hoo to Cadbury Schweppes, with production responsibilities falling to CS's Mott's group and marketing and advertising responsibilities under Snapple. They heightened awareness of the once-popular beverage.\n\nThe milk company's headquarters are in Tarrytown, New York, with plants in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and Aspers, Pennsylvania.

At one time, Yoo-hoo owned several other chocolate milk brands as well, including Choc-Ola, Brownie, Cocoa Dusty, and Chocolate Soldier. \n\nAs of early February 2019, Yoo-hoo is made from water, high fructose corn syrup, whey (from milk), and less than 2% of: cocoa (alkali process), nonfat dry milk, natural and artificial flavors, sodium caseinate (from milk), corn syrup solids, calcium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, palm oil, guar gum, xanthan gum, mono and diglycerides, salt, spice, soy lecithin, niacinamide (vitamin B3), sucralose, vitamin A palmitate, riboflavin (vitamin B2), and vitamin D3. \n\nIn May 2008, Cadbury-Schweppes split into the Cadbury candy business and the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group soft drink firm, with the latter taking over Yoo-hoo.\n\nAn ABC News article mentioned that on a papal visit to Denver, a variety of sources reported that Pope John Paul II liked Yoo-hoo after a Vatican spokesman mentioned that the Pope wanted \"a couple of cases of that American chocolate drink he likes\" on board his plane. As popes do not give commercial endorsements, a subsequent statement from his spokesman denied that the pontiff had any particular preference among American milk drinks.\n\nYoo-hoo's several flavors include chocolate, strawberry, chocolate banana, chocolate strawberry, chocolate peanut butter, and chocolate caramel. A double fudge flavor and Island Coconut flavor was discontinued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "254713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254713", "title": "Agar plate", "text": "Agar plate\n\nAn agar plate is a Petri dish that contains agar as a solid growth medium plus nutrients, used to culture microorganisms. Sometimes selective compounds are added to influence growth, such as antibiotics.\n\nIndividual microorganisms placed on the plate will grow into individual colonies, each a clone genetically identical to the individual ancestor organism (except for the low, unavoidable rate of mutation). Thus, the plate can be used either to estimate the concentration of organisms in a liquid culture or a suitable dilution of that culture using a colony counter, or to generate genetically pure cultures from a mixed culture of genetically different organisms.\n\nSeveral methods are available to plate out cells. One technique is known as \"streaking\". In this technique, a drop of the culture on the end of a thin, sterile loop of wire, sometimes known as an inoculator, is streaked across the surface of the agar leaving organisms behind, a higher number at the beginning of the streak and a lower number at the end. At some point during a successful \"streak\", the number of organisms deposited will be such that distinct individual colonies will grow in that area which may be removed for further culturing, using another sterile loop.\n\nAnother way of plating organisms, next to streaking, on agar plates is the spot analysis. This type of analysis is often used to check the viability of cells and performed with pinners (often also called froggers). A third used technique is the use of sterile glass beads to plate out cells. In this technique cells are grown in a liquid culture of which a small volume is pipetted on the agar plate and then spread out with the beads. Replica plating is another technique in order to plate out cells on agar plates. These four techniques are the most common, but others are also possible. It is crucial to work in a sterile manner in order to prevent contamination on the agar plates. Plating is thus often done in a laminar flow cabinet or on the working bench next to a bunsen burner.\n\nIn 1881, Fanny Hesse, who was working as a technician for her husband Walther Hesse in the laboratory of Robert Koch, suggested agar as an effective setting agent, since it had been commonplace in jam making for some time.\n\nLike other growth media, the formulations of agar used in plates may be classified as either \"defined\" or \"undefined\"; a defined medium is synthesized from individual chemicals required by the organism so the exact molecular composition is known, whereas an undefined medium is made from natural products such as yeast extract, where the precise composition is unknown.\n\nAgar plates may be formulated as either permissive, with the intent of allowing the growth of whatever organisms are present, or restrictive or selective, with the intent of only allowing growth a particular subset of those organisms. This may take the form of a nutritional requirement, for instance providing a particular compound such as lactose as the only source of carbon and thereby selecting only organisms which can metabolize that compound, or by including a particular antibiotic or other substance to select only organisms which are resistant to that substance. This correlates to some degree with defined and undefined media; undefined media, made from natural products and containing an unknown combination of very many organic molecules, is typically more permissive in terms of supplying the needs of a wider variety of organisms, while defined media can be precisely tailored to select organisms with specific properties.\n\nAgar plates may also be indicator plates, in which the organisms are not selected on the basis of growth, but are instead distinguished by a color change in some colonies, typically caused by the action of an enzyme on some compound added to the medium.\n\nThe plates are incubated for 12 hours up to several days depending on the test that is performed.\n\nSome commonly used agar plate types are:\nBlood agar plates (BAPs) contain mammalian blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at a concentration of 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include \"Streptococcus haemolyticus\". α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example of this would be \"Streptococcus viridans\". γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.\n\nChocolate agar is a type of blood agar plate in which the blood cells have been lysed by heating the cells to 56 °C. It is used for growing fastidious respiratory bacteria, such as \"Haemophilus influenzae\". No chocolate is actually contained in the plate; it is named for the coloration only.\n\nHorse blood agar is a type of blood-enriched microbiological culture media. As it is enriched, it allows the growth of certain fastidious bacteria, and allows indication of haemolytic activity in these bacterial cultures.\n\nThayer-Martin agar is a chocolate agar designed to isolate \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\".\n\nThiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar enhances growth of \"Vibrio\" spp., including \"Vibrio cholerae\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent specific types of agar:\n\n"}

When mozzarella is heated to 60 °C and then stretched, the milk proteins line up. It is possible to peel strings or strips from the larger cheese.\n\nIn Slovakia, korbáčiky is made, which is a salty sheep milk cheese, available smoked or unsmoked. It is traditionally made by hand-pulling steamed sheep's cheese into strings and braiding them. Cow milk versions are also available.\n\nIn Armenia, traditional string cheese is made with a white base. The type of milk used usually comes from an aged goat or sheep depending upon the production methods of the area of choice. It includes black cumin and a middle-eastern spice known as mahleb, and it comes in the form of a braided endless loop. The cheese forms strings because of the way it is pulled during processing. There is also Syrian cheese processed this way. Other cheeses are only cut and pressed, not pulled, and don't develop strings.\n\nIn Georgia and Russia string cheese is known as tenili (). It is made from fermented sheep's milk and cream allowed to mature for 60 days in a salted and dried veal stomach.\n\nCheestrings became a popular snack in the UK and Republic of Ireland in the early 1990s. They are made from processed cheese by Kerry Group and the mascot is a cartoon character called Mr Strings. The original advert had a theme tune based on the popular song \"Bend Me, Shape Me\", but with different lyrics (\"You got a cheese string day or night, you got a cheese string you're all right\"). The first version of this advert was set at a kids' disco, and a later remake was set at a funfair. Originally Mr Strings was a wild cartoon character who pulled himself apart but by the late 1990s the packaging had been redesigned with a more simplified mascot. On television the original Mr Strings was phased out during the mid 2000s and replaced by an unseen character who played creepy practical jokes on teenage consumers. In the late 2000s the design of Mr Strings was changed for a third time to appear more child-friendly and was given a new catchphrase (\"Hey, I'm just cheese\").\n\nIn the present day, cheesestrings are available in cheddar, mozzarella, and the two colour cheddar and red leicester twisters. Discontinued flavours include cheddar and smoky bacon, and pizza. Kerry exports Gouda cheesestrings from Charleville, County Cork to Holland, and a Gouda-Emmental mix to France, where the product is known as Ficello. Low cost imitations of the original cheddar cheesestrings were formerly manufactured in the UK by Tesco, Dairylea, and currently by Dunnes Stores. An item in the product range of the original Kerry cheesestrings, known as Attack-A-Snack (a rival to Dairylea Lunchables), packaged with a tortilla wrap or cracker, sachet of tomato ketchup, and piece of processed ham has been available from the late 90s.\n\nIn Mexico, the first type of string cheese was invented in 1885 by Leobarda Castellanos García at 14 years old. A very popular type of string cheese called Quesillo is sold today in balls of various sizes. It is also known as \"Queso Oaxaca\" or Oaxaca cheese referred to the place of origin it was invented, and now it's widely popular in all Mexican territories.\n\nIn the United States, string cheese generally refers to snack-sized servings of low-moisture mozzarella. This form of string cheese is roughly cylindrical, about 6 inches (15 cm) long and less than 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter. The common term is a \"cheese stick\" which is cut and packaged, either individually or as a package of several lengths. The cheese used is nearly always a form of mozzarella, or a combination of mozzarella and cheddar. This type of string cheese gets its name because it can be eaten by pulling strips of cheese from the cylinder along its length and eating these strings. It was invented in 1976 by Frank Baker and Jeb Cubbs.\n\nIn Australia, string cheese is sold by Bega Cheese and is called Bega Stringers. Also, string cheese can be sold in a can.\n\n\n"}

It is a variety of Curaçao liqueur, an orange-flavored liqueur made from the dried peels of bitter and sweet oranges.\n\nThe etymology of \"triple sec\" is unclear. \"Sec\" is the French word for dry. Triple sec may refer to the schnapps being distilled three times, having triple the flavor, being three times as dry as other spirits, or it could just be a marketing gimmick.\n\nTriple sec may be consumed neat as a digestif, or on the rocks. However, it is more typically used as an ingredient in a variety of cocktails, such as sangria, margarita, Kamikaze, White Lady, Long Island Iced Tea, Sidecar, Skittle Bomb, Corpse Reviver #2 and Cosmopolitan.\n\nThe Combier distillery claims that triple sec was invented in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Combier in Saumur, France. However, the Combier distillery was more famous for its élixir \"Combier\", which contained orange but also many other flavorings.\n\nAccording to Cointreau, its orange liqueur was created in 1849.\n\nTriple sec was certainly widely known by 1878; at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, several distillers were offering \"Curaço triple sec\", as well as \"Curaço doux\".\n\n"}

One popular brand was \"Vin Mariani\", developed in 1863 by French-Corsican chemist and entrepreneur Angelo Mariani.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the fear of drug abuse made coca-based drinks less popular. This led to the prohibition of cocaine in the United States in 1914 via the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, and the removal of cocaine from coca wine as well as Coca-Cola, though coca leaf remained. Coca wine itself became illegal in the United States when its other main drug, alcohol, was banned just a few years later with Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.\n\nIn Atlanta, John Pemberton, a pharmacist, developed a beverage based on Vin Mariani, called Pemberton's French Wine Coca. It proved popular among American consumers. In 1886, when Georgia introduced Prohibition, Pemberton had to replace the wine in his recipe with non-alcoholic syrup. The new recipe became Coca-Cola.\n\n"}
{"id": "261596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261596", "title": "Prana", "text": "Prana\n\nIn Hindu philosophy including yoga, Indian medicine and Indian martial arts, prana (, ; the Sanskrit word for \"life force\" or \"vital principle\") permeates reality on all levels including inanimate objects. In Hindu literature, prana is sometimes described as originating from the Sun and connecting the elements. \n\nFive types of prana, collectively known as the five \"vāyus,\" are referred to in Hindu texts. Ayurveda, tantra and Tibetan medicine all describe \"praṇā vāyu\" as the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise.\n\nThe ancient concept of prana is described in many Hindu texts, including Upanishads and Vedas. One of the earliest references to prana is from the 3,000-year-old \"Chandogya Upanishad\", but many other Upanishads use the concept, including the \"Katha\", \"Mundaka\" and \"Prasna Upanishads\". The concept is elaborated upon in great detail in the literature of haṭha yoga, tantra, and Ayurveda.\n\nThe \"Bhagavadgita\" 4.27 describes the yoga of self-control as the sacrifice of the actions of the senses and of prana in the fire kindled by knowledge. More generally, the conquest of the senses, the mind, and prana is seen as an essential step on the yogin's path to samadhi, or indeed as the goal of yoga. Thus for example the \"Malinivijayottaratantra\" 12.5–7 directs the seeker \"who has conquered posture, the mind, prana, the senses, sleep, anger, fear, and anxiety\" to practise yoga in a beautiful undisturbed cave.\n\nPrana is typically divided into constituent parts, particularly when concerned with the human body. While not all early sources agree on the names or number of these divisions, the most common list from the \"Mahabharata\", the Upanishads, Ayurvedic and Yogic sources includes five classifications, often subdivided. This list includes prana (inward moving energy), apana (outward moving energy), vyana (circulation of energy), udana (energy of the head and throat), and samana (digestion and assimilation). \n\nEarly mention of specific pranas often emphasized prāṇa, apāna and vyāna as \"the three breaths\". This can be seen in the proto-yogic traditions of the Vratyas among others. Texts like the \"Vaikānasasmārta\" utilized the five pranas as an internalization of the five sacrificial fires of a panchagni homa ceremony.\n\nThe \"Atharva Veda\" describes Prana: 'When they had been watered by Prana, the plants spake in concert: 'thou hast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.' (11.4–6) 'The holy (âtharvana) plants, the magic (ângirasa) plants, the divine plants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Prâna, quickenest them (11.4–16). 'When Prâna has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring forth, and also every sort of herb.' (11.4–17) 'O Prâna, be not turned away from me, thou shall not be other than myself! As the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Prâna, do bind to me, that I may live.' (11.4)\n\nSimilar concepts exist in various cultures, including the Latin \"anima\" (\"breath\", \"vital force\", \"animating principle\"), Islamic and Sufic ruh, the Greek pneuma, the Chinese qi, the Polynesian mana, the Amerindian orenda, the German od, and the Hebrew ruah. Prana is also described as subtle energy or life force.\n\nOne way of categorizing prana is by means of vāyus. \"Vāyu\" means \"wind\" or \"air\" in Sanskrit, and the term is used in a variety of contexts in Hindu philosophy. Prāṇa is considered the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise, as well as one of the five major vāyus. Prāṇā is thus the generic name for all the breaths, including the five major vāyus of prāṇa, apāna, uḍāna, samāna, and vyāna. The \"Nisvasattvasamhita Nayasutra\" describes five minor winds, naming three of these as naga, dhanamjaya, and kurma; the other two are named in the \"Skandapurana\" (181.46) and \"Sivapurana Vayaviyasamhita\" (37.36) as devadatta and krtaka.\n\nIndian philosophy describes prana flowing in nadis (channels), though the details vary. The \"Brhadaranyaka Upanishad\" (2.I.19) mentions 72,000 nadis, running out from the heart, whereas the \"Katha Upanishad\" (6.16) says that 101 channels radiate from the heart. The \"Vinashikhatantra\" (140-146) explains the most common model, namely that the three most important nadis are the Ida on the left, the Pingala on the right, and the Sushumna in the centre connecting the base chakra to the crown chakra, enabling prana to flow throughout the subtle body.\n\nWhen the mind is agitated due to our interactions with the world at large, the physical body also follows in its wake. These agitations cause violent fluctuations in the flow of prana in the nadis.\n\nThe word \"Prāṇāyāma\" derives from the Sanskrit words \"prāṇa\" and \"ayāma\", translating as \"life force\" and \"expansion\", respectively. It is a common term for various techniques for accumulating, expanding and working with prana. Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of yoga and is a practice of specific and often intricate breath control techniques. The dynamics and laws of Prana were understood through systematic practice of Pranayama to gain mastery over Prana.\n\nMany pranayama techniques are designed to cleanse the nadis, allowing for greater movement of prana. Other techniques may be utilized to arrest the breath for samadhi or to bring awareness to specific areas in the practitioner's subtle or physical body. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is utilized to generate inner heat in the practice of tummo.\n\nIn Ayurveda and therapeutic yoga, pranayama is utilized for many tasks, including to affect mood and aid in digestion. A. G. Mohan stated that the physical goals of pranayama may be to recover from illness or the maintenance of health, while its mental goals are: \"to remove mental disturbances and make the mind focused for meditation\".\n\nAccording to the scholar-practitioner of yoga Theos Bernard, the ultimate aim of pranayama is the suspension of breathing, \"causing the mind to swoon\".\nSwami Yogananda writes, \"The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "262377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262377", "title": "French 75 (cocktail)", "text": "French 75 (cocktail)\n\nFrench 75 is a cocktail made from gin, Champagne, lemon juice, and sugar. It is also called a 75 Cocktail, or in French simply a \"Soixante Quinze\" (Seventy Five).\n\nThe drink dates to World War I, and an early form was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris—later Harry's New York Bar—by barman Harry MacElhone. The combination was said to have such a kick that it felt like being shelled with the powerful French 75mm field gun.\n\nThe drink with its current name and recipe developed over the 1920s, though similar drinks date to the 19th century. In the 19th century, the \"Champagne cup\" was a popular cocktail, consisting of champagne, lemon juice, sugar, and ice. Gin was sometimes added, yielding a drink much like the French 75.\n\nThe drink was first recorded as the 75 in \"Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails\", 1922 edition, by Harry MacElhone, and in the same year in Robert Vermeire's \"Cocktails: How to Mix Them,\" which credits the drink to MacElhone. However, the recipes differed from the current form – MacElhone's version consisted of Calvados, gin, grenadine, and absinthe, while Vermeire added lemon juice.\n\nThe recipe took its now-classic form and \"French 75\" name in \"Here’s How\", by Judge Jr. (1927), consisting of gin, sugar, lemon juice, and champagne. This recipe was republished with the name French 75 in \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930), which helped popularize the drink. Some later cocktail books use Cognac instead of gin, such as \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\" by David A. Embury.\n\nThe French 75 was popularized in America at the Stork Club in New York. It appears in the movie \"Casablanca\" (1942) and is referenced twice in the John Wayne films \"A Man Betrayed\" (1941) and \"Jet Pilot\" (1957). In 2016, it appears in the ITV series, \"Mr. Selfridge\", which is set in London in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nA fanciful alternative story of the invention of the French 75 was related by Jean Shepherd on November 17, 1969, wherein he credits Gervais Raoul Lufbery as the inventor. The mixture, as related by Shepherd, is Champagne and Cognac on ice with perhaps a twist of lemon. This version is not credible, given the documented earlier version.\n\nThe recipe of the French 75 is very similar to one of the most popular cocktails, the Tom Collins, with Champagne replacing carbonated water. According to the recipe in Harry MacElhone's book \"Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails,\" a French 75 is supposed to be served in a highball glass. The Highball glass, which the Tom Collins Cocktail is also served in, would support the theory of French 75 being a variation of the Tom Collins.\n\n"}
{"id": "262756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262756", "title": "Tango (drink)", "text": "Tango (drink)\n\nTango is a soft drink originating in the United Kingdom, primarily sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hungary and Malta, first launched by Corona in 1950. The name Tango came from Ivan Colman describing the drink as having a \"tang\". Corona was purchased by the Beecham Group in 1958, and Corona Soft Drinks by Britvic in 1987.\n\nOriginally, Tango was the name of the orange flavour in a range of different flavoured drinks, that each had their own name. In the 1990s, long after the other products in the range had been discontinued, the Tango brand was expanded into other flavours, including apple, lemon, cherry, blackcurrant, and later \"Fruit Fling\".\n\n, the flavours available in the United Kingdom include orange, apple, blackcurrant, cherry and citrus, in addition to flavours of the slushpuppy-style \"Tango Ice Blast\" range. Tango is well known in the United Kingdom for their advertisements, mostly those broadcast on television in the 1990s with the aid of advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury.\n\nSince 2001, Tango has offered a frozen slush range branded as “Tango Ice Blast”. They have primarily been known to be sold in cinema chains across the UK such as Odeon, Vue and Cineworld. They have been sold as individual flavours or a combination of flavours. The typical machine will have two flavours on tap.\n\nThe famous drop tower at Blackpool Pleasure Beach was marketing as “The Blast in promotion with Tango.”\n\nFlavours currently available:\n\nFormer/ limited edition flavours:\nSummer Flavour Fesitval (2015 promotion)\n\nAdvertisements for Tango attracted attention in the 1990s when they became well known for their distinctively bizarre and post modern tone. The advertisements arguably became more talked about than the product itself, and manufacturer Britvic considers the drink to be \"probably most famous for its successful and innovative marketing campaigns\".\n\nThe drink's first iconic campaign introduced the catchphrase \"You know when you've been Tango'd\", produced by advertising agency HHCL. The campaign began in 1992 with an advert, \"Orange Man\", featuring a man drinking Tango and immediately being slapped around the face, by a portly man painted orange (Peter Geeves). The advert received widespread condemnation after a craze for \"Tangoing\" people swept the nation's playgrounds, and there were reports of children receiving serious injuries, or even being deafened by being slapped on the ears.\n\nTango voluntarily replaced the \"slapping\" advert with an almost identical new version, where the orange clad person kisses the man instead of hitting him. The original version was named the third best television commercial of all time, in a poll in 2000 conducted by \"The Sunday Times\" and Channel 4.\n\nMost subsequent Tango advertisements have avoided showing violence, except for the advert from October 2004, \"Pipes\", which showed a man rolling down a hill with concrete pipes, causing it to be banned, and the advert from March 1997, \"Vote Orange Now\", where the orange clad man made another appearance, slapping the advert's protagonist several times. This latter advert was featured in the first advert break on Channel 5.\n\nIn March 2000, an advert which premièred in 1998 featuring James Corden being bullied for not drinking Tango was banned because it was seen as encouraging the bullying of overweight children. The replacement was a satirically inoffensive advert, \"Drink Tango: It's Nice\".\n\nDuring August 1999, Tango teamed up with the newspapers \"Daily Mail\" and \"Daily Record\" to extend their summer peak sales period in a campaign called \"Tango Time\". The main thread of the campaign activity was a competition where a time of day is printed on the base of cans of Tango. The winning 'Tango Time' was published in the Daily Mirror and Daily Record and winners invited to call a prize claim line. The newspaper adverts were trailed by branding on the front page, including a free offer for a bottle of Tango. The adverts containing the winning 'Tango Time' ran for twenty six days in August 1999.\n\nTango Apple has often been subject to experimental advertising including an \"Apple Tango Calendar\" given free in June 1996 with the \"Daily Star\" and, in 2003, the \"Big Drench Tour\", a roadshow of a thirty foot tall apple shaped installation filled with water. Players must stand underneath and take part in a game of 'drench roulette' to win prizes.\n\nLater that year, as Tango Strange Soda launched, three ultimately unsuccessful advertisements for the drink (\"Taste Buds\", \"Trainers\" and \"Classroom\") were aired featuring a man's \"taste buddies\" which are a group of young men behaving as the man's taste buds that vibrate rapidly when the man consumes Strange Soda. The \"taste buddy\" actors in the advertisements were shot as live action, with the actor standing on a moveable circular frame which was then manoeuvred via a handle to give the \"vibrating\" trembling effect for each of the \"buddies\" seen on screen.\n\nIn August 2009, a billboard campaign extolled the \"weird and wonderful\" side effects of drinking too much \"Tango with added Tango Orange\" (such as \"Too much Tango made me suck a bull's udder\"). The British press pointed out that the initials of \"Tango With Added Tango\" spelled the insult \"twat\" when read vertically, and this was later revealed to be intentional.\n\nTango advertisements have sometimes featured phone numbers for viewers to call, although the phone numbers would typically appear too briefly on the screen for viewers to type in the number or write it down. Many of these advertisements incorporate a send-away prize, including a rubber doll or a clown horn (the Tango Horn). \n\nA notable exception was an advert which first premièred in 1993 for Still Tango disguised as a subvert falsely alerting people that the drink is unauthorised, and features a phone number for 'affected' viewers to call. Tango sponsored the television show \"The Word\" in 1994 and the Underage Festival in 2010. Historically, slogans have included \"You Taste the Tang in Tango Every Sparkling Sip You Take\" in the 1960s and \"The Whole Fruit\" in the late 1980s.\n\nBlackcurrant Tango is a carbonated soft drink launched in the United Kingdom by Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd in 1996. The drink is notable for the multiple award-winning television commercial from 1997, St George, which was used to promote it. The drink has since been discontinued. A previous ad for the drink aired in 1996. Blackcurrant Tango was relaunched in August 2011, as an exclusive flavour to Asda, and since December 2012, is sold by other retailers.\n\nFor the launch of Blackcurrant Tango in 1996, HHCL produced the \"St. George\" television and cinema advertisement. In the advertisement, a member of Tango's customer service staff, Ray Gardner, provides a response to a letter of complaint about the flavour of Blackcurrant Tango he has received from Sebastien Loyes, a French exchange student. The letter prompts an increasingly jingoistic tirade during which Ray Gardner removes his suit to reveal bright purple boxing shorts. In one seemingly continuous take, he walks from his office, marches out of Tango's building, and is joined by a flag waving crowd as he enters a boxing ring.\n\nAs the camera pulls back, the ring is revealed to be perched on the edge of the White Cliffs of Dover. As the camera circles, Gardner can be heard shouting, \"Come on France, Europe, the world. I'll take you all on! I'm Ray Gardner. I drink Blackcurrant Tango. Come and get me!\" whilst three Harrier Jump Jets with purple landing lights hover in the background.\n\nThe advertisement was notable for the use of digital editing to seamlessly merge a number of tracking shots, including the final transition from a sky camera to a helicopter shot. Ray Gardner later won the ITV \"Best Actor In A Commercial\" award for his performance. The commercial was voted the Best Long Commercial (1956–2001), by the United Kingdom's Film4 television channel in June 2007. The song that appeared in the advertisement, \"Don't You Want Me\" by Felix, was rereleased with Tango branding.\n\nThe first packaging that Britvic introduced, upon buying the brand in 1987, featured the word 'Tango' on a circle with an orange background. In 1989, the cast, material and graphic design of the can changed considerably. No longer molded in the shape of a baked bean can in a non reusable steel material, Tango was now available in a recyclable aluminium composition, with an innovative new ring pull system. On the can itself, the word 'Tango' was featured inside an oval on a backdrop of half sliced oranges.\n\nThe design was often seen on display in the form of laminated stickers, in the shop windows of confectionery stores and newsagents. 1992 saw the packaging change again, with the 'Tango' logo depicted on the fruit the drink was flavoured with against a black background, with the flavour specified at the bottom.\n\nIn the beginning of 1996, Tango packaging changed again, with the words 'Tango' and the respective flavour written on something representing the drink (for example, an orange explosion for Tango Orange). Slight changes were made in 1997, adding more detail. In April 2002, another revamp occurred, with a more three dimensional logo. The design was dropped in 2007, although is still used by Tango Ice Blast. The Diet Tango Orange products from this era featured a grey background instead of a black one.\n\nThe summer of 2007 saw a much simpler logo and design, featuring the 'Tango' logo on top of a carved version of the fruit, with the flavour written in lower case at the bottom. Intended to help restore sales of Tango, it actually led to a further decline. May 2009 saw new packaging created by \"Blue Marlin Brand Design\". It featured mashed up images of fruit and graffiti style type, and contributed to a rise in sales.\n\nFor limited edition variations of Tango, special packaging has sometimes been produced for them. Notably, the 'Tango Talk' rebrand of Tango Orange and Tango Apple featured a mobile phone in place of the flavour representation featured on regular versions of the flavours at the time. The 2009 larger can packaging of Tango Orange known as \"Tango with Added Tango Orange\" featured more oranges in the background. The same can be said for the 2010 \"King Tango\" Tango Orange bottles. More apples were used on the label for King Tango Apple and more cherries for King Tango Cherry. No changes to flavour was made only the size of the can or bottle.\n\nThe labelling of the short lived Tango Strange Soda featured a \"strange\" fruit with facial features, patterned after the name and flavour of the drink. \"Tango Orange Sound System: Official Can\", a 2010 repackaging of the notably large \"Tango with Added Tango Orange\" featured speakers on the can, in place of the mashed-up fruit. Both these large cans were advertised as \"the first time Tango cans are larger\". This is not true, as from 1991 until roughly 2000, all Tango flavours could be purchased in similar size larger cans. The large cans, at the initial 1991 launch, were called \"King-Size\".\n\nDuring 2000, short lived 250ml bottles of Tango were introduced as part of a £42m campaign by Britvic, to market their drinks as being suitable for children's lunch boxes. The campaign also introduced the popular Robinson's line of juice drinks Fruit Shoot.\n\nTango Cherry and Tango Lemon were first to feature the revamp of 2002, getting the treatment in September 2001.\n\nIn addition to orange, Tango has been sold in numerous flavours. Tango Lemon was introduced in the 1950s, and more recent flavours have included apple in the 1980s, and blackcurrant and cherry in the 1990s. A range of Diet Tango products were released in the 1990s, later branded as \"Tango No Added Sugar\". Some variants are still sold, but most have been discontinued. The orange flavour was the only original flavour, and for this reason is the flagship flavour of the brand. As well as drinks, the brand have also sold two different chocolate bars, and chewy ball sweets.\n\nThere have been two product recalls of the drink throughout its long history. In June 1994, the brand recalled more than a million bottles of Still Tango, after complaints that the drink was fermenting on the shelves. The drink was not relaunched until September 1995. Then, on 25 August 2005, over 100,000 cans of Tango Cherry and Tango Fruit Fling were recalled over fears they could explode due to an ingredient in the drink.\n\nIn July 2011, Turbo Tango, when launched, was described as the \"first aerosol drink\". In October 2000, Tango introduced a flavoured bar of Crunchie. During 2011, several flavours of Chew Stick and Chewy Bonbons were introduced. In January 2013, a Tango branded shower gel was launched. A Tango branded hand soap was also launched around the same time.\n\n"}
{"id": "263328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263328", "title": "Princeps", "text": "Princeps\n\nPrinceps (plural: principes) is a Latin word meaning \"first in time or order; the first, foremost, chief, the most eminent, distinguished, or noble; the first man, first person\". As a title, \"princeps\" originated in the Roman Republic wherein the leading member of the Senate was designated \"princeps senatus\". It is primarily associated with the Roman emperors as an unofficial title first adopted by Augustus in 23 BC. Its use in this context continued until the reign of Diocletian at the end of the third century. He preferred the title of \"dominus\", meaning \"lord\" or \"master\". As a result, the Roman Empire from Augustus to Diocletian is termed the \"principate\" (\"principatus\") and from Diocletian onwards as the \"dominate\" (\"dominatus\"). Other historians define the reign of Augustus to Severus Alexander as the Principate, and the period afterwards as the \"Autocracy\".\n\nThe medieval title \"Prince\" is a derivative of princeps.\n\n\"Princeps\" was also used as the second part of various other military titles, such as \"Decurio princeps\", Signifer princeps (among the standard-bearers). See also Principalis (as in \"Optio principalis\"): NCO.\n\nPrinceps is also the (official) short version of Princeps officii, the chief of an officium (the office staff of a Roman dignitary).\n\n\"Princeps civitatis\" (\"First Citizen\") was an official title of a Roman Emperor as the title determining the leader in Ancient Rome at the beginning of the Roman Empire. It created the principate Roman imperial system.\n\nThis usage of \"princeps\" derived from the position of \"Princeps senatus\", the \"first among equals\" of the Senate. The \"princeps senatus\" (plural \"principes senatus\") was the first member by precedence of the Roman Senate, and his opinion would usually be asked first in senatorial debates.\n\nIt was first given as a special title to Caesar Augustus in 27 BC, who saw that use of the titles rex (king) or dictator would create resentment amongst senators and other influential men, who had earlier demonstrated their disapproval by supporting the assassination of Julius Caesar. While Augustus had political and military supremacy, he needed the assistance of his fellow Romans to manage the Empire. In his \"Res Gestae\", Augustus claims auctoritas for the princeps (himself).\n\nVarious official titles were associated with the Roman Emperor. These titles included imperator, Augustus, Caesar, and later dominus (lord) and basileus (the Greek word for \"sovereign\"). The word Emperor is derived from the Roman title \"imperator\", which was a very high, but not exclusive, military title until Augustus began to use it as his praenomen.\n\nThe Emperor Diocletian (284–305), the father of the Tetrarchy, was the first to stop referring to himself as \"princeps\" altogether, calling himself \"dominus\" (lord, master), thus dropping the pretense that emperor was not truly a monarchical office. The period when the emperors that called themselves princeps ruled—from Augustus to Diocletian—is called \"the Principate\", Diocletian's rule began \"the Dominate\" period.\n\nAncient Rome knew another kind of \"princely\" principes too, like \"princeps iuventutis\" (\"the first amongst the young\"), which in the early empire was frequently bestowed on eligible successors to the emperor, especially from his family. It was first given to Augustus' maternal grandsons Gaius and Lucius.\n\n\"Princeps\" is the root and Latin rendering of modern words as the English title and generic term \"prince\" (see that article, also for various equivalents in other languages), as the Byzantine version of Roman law was the basis for the legal terminology developed in feudal (and later absolutist) Europe.\n\n\"Princeps\" is also the name of an obsolete genus of Swallowtail butterflies (now merged with the genus Papilio).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "263656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263656", "title": "Tuna salad", "text": "Tuna salad\n\nTuna salad is typically a blend of two main ingredients: tuna and mayonnaise. The tuna used is usually pre-cooked, canned, and packaged in water or oil. Pickles, celery, relish, and onion are ingredients that are often added. When the spread is placed on bread, it makes a tuna salad sandwich. Tuna salad is also regularly served on top of lettuce, tomato, avocado, or crackers, or by itself.\n\nQuick homemade tuna salad is often made by omitting the eggs and only adding relish to the tuna and mayonnaise or egg mayonnaise-substitute. Eggs are omitted because they must be cooked whereas the other ingredients are purchased ready to eat. Relish adds a piquant flavor but, unlike commonly added vegetables, requires no chopping.\n\nIn Belgium, the dish \"pêches au thon\"/\"perziken met tonijn\" (peaches with tuna) is made from halved canned or fresh peaches stuffed with tuna salad. It is widespread throughout the country, and due to its ease of preparation, it is common fare at potlucks.\n\nSometimes, as a healthier alternative to mayonnaise, mashed avocado and a squeeze of lemon juice are used in the preparation of tuna salad.\n\nTuna salad has been eaten for over 100 years. The first written reference to tuna salad, in America, appeared in 1907, and by 1914 dozens of recipes had been published. Tuna salad, especially with celery, is similar to chicken salad while also being much cheaper, a fact that helped its early rise in popularity.\n\nDue to tuna salad being high in vitamins, it gained the status of a dieter's dish in the 1960s.\n\n"}
{"id": "264211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264211", "title": "Root (linguistics)", "text": "Root (linguistics)\n\nA root (or root word) is a word that does not have a prefix in front of the word or a suffix at the end of the word. The root word is the primary lexical unit of a word, and of a word family (this root is then called the base word), which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.\nContent words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of root morphemes. However, sometimes the term \"root\" is also used to describe the word minus its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place. For example, \"chatters\" has the inflectional root or lemma \"chatter\", but the lexical root \"chat\". Inflectional roots are often called stems, and a root in the stricter sense may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem.\n\nThe traditional definition allows roots to be either free morphemes or bound morphemes. Root morphemes are essential for affixation and compounds. However, in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term \"root\" is generally synonymous with \"free morpheme\". Many such languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word: Yup'ik, for instance, has no more than two thousand. \n\nThe root of a word is a unit of meaning (morpheme) and, as such, it is an abstraction, though it can usually be represented alphabetically as a word might be. For example, it can be said that the root of the English verb form \"running\" is \"run\", or the root of the Spanish superlative adjective \"amplísimo\" is \"ampli-\", since those words are clearly derived from the root forms by simple suffixes that do not alter the roots in any way. In particular, English has very little inflection and a tendency to have words that are identical to their roots. But more complicated inflection, as well as other processes, can obscure the root; for example, the root of \"mice\" is \"mouse\" (still a valid word), and the root of \"interrupt\" is, arguably, \"rupt\", which is not a word in English and only appears in derivational forms (such as \"disrupt\", \"corrupt\", \"rupture\", etc.). The root \"rupt\" is written as if it were a word, but it is not.\n\nThis distinction between the word as a unit of speech and the root as a unit of meaning is even more important in the case of languages where roots have many different forms when used in actual words, as is the case in Semitic languages. In these, roots are formed by consonants alone, and speakers elaborate different words (belonging potentially to different parts of speech) from the root by inserting different vowels. For example, in Hebrew, the root gdl represents the idea of largeness, and from it we have gadol and gdola\" (masculine and feminine forms of the adjective \"big\"), gadal \"he grew\", \"higdil \"he magnified\" and \"magdelet\" \"magnifier\", along with many other words such as godel \"size\" and \"migdal\" \"tower\".\n\nRoots and reconstructed roots can become the stock-in-trade of etymology.\n\nSecondary roots are roots with changes in them, producing a new word with a slightly different meaning. In English, a rough equivalent would be to see \"conductor\" as a secondary root formed from the root \"to conduct\". In abjad languages, the most familiar of which are Arabic and Hebrew, in which families of secondary roots are fundamental to the language, secondary roots are created by changes in the roots' vowels, by adding or removing the long vowels \"a\", \"i\", \"u\", \"e\" and \"o\". (Notice that Arabic does not have the vowels \"e\" and \"o\".) In addition, secondary roots can be created by prefixing (\"m−\", \"t−\"), infixing (\"−t−\"), or suffixing (\"−i\", and several others). There is no rule in these languages on how many secondary roots can be derived from a single root; some roots have few, but other roots have many, not all of which are necessarily in current use.\n\nConsider the Arabic language:\n\nSimilar cases occur in Hebrew, for example Israeli Hebrew מקמ √mqm ‘locate’, which derives from Biblical Hebrew מקום \"måqom\" ‘place’, whose root is קומ √qwm ‘stand’. A recent example introduced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language is מדרוג \"midrúg\" ‘rating’, from מדרג \"midrág\", whose root is דרג √drg ‘grade’.\"\n\nAccording to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, \"this process is morphologically similar to the production of frequentative (iterative) verbs in Latin, for example:\n\nConsider also Rabbinic Hebrew תרמ √trm ‘donate, contribute’ (Mishnah: T’rumoth 1:2: ‘separate priestly dues’), which derives from Biblical Hebrew תרומה \"t'rūmå\" ‘contribution’, whose root is רומ √rwm ‘raise’; cf. Rabbinic Hebrew תרע √tr` ‘sound the trummpet, blow the horn’, from Biblical Hebrew תרועה \"t'rū`å\" ‘shout, cry, loud sound, trumpet-call’, in turn from רוע √rw`.\"\nand it describes the suffix.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "265416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265416", "title": "Orangina", "text": "Orangina\n\nOrangina () is a lightly carbonated beverage made from carbonated water, 12% citrus juice (10% from concentrated orange, 2% from a combination of concentrated lemon, concentrated mandarin, and concentrated grapefruit juices), as well as 2% orange pulp. Orangina is sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup (glucose fructose) and natural flavors are added. \n\nOrangina was invented at a trade fair in Algeria, developed by Augustin Trigo Mirallès from Spain, and first sold in Algeria by Léon Beton in 1935. Today it is a popular beverage in Europe, Japan, northern Africa, and to a lesser extent in North America.\n\nSince November 2009, Orangina has been owned by Suntory in most of the world. In the United States, the brand has been owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group (now Keurig Dr Pepper) since 2006. In Canada, the brand is owned by Canada Dry Motts Inc.\n\nOrangina started as Naranjina, presented at the 1935 Marseille Trade Fair by its Spanish inventor, chemist Augustin Trigo, from Valencia, who invented it in 1933. The drink was created from a mix of citrus juice, sugar, and carbonated water. It was later called TriNaranjus (now, TriNa) for the Spanish market.\n\nLéon Beton bought the concept and recipe for Naranjina in 1935. However, the outbreak of major conflicts, notably World War II, largely sidelined Léon Beton's attempts to market his drink in Europe.\n\nHis son, Jean-Claude Beton, took over the company from his father in 1947. Jean-Claude Beton kept most of the original recipe, which he marketed to appeal to European and North African consumers. Orangina quickly became a common beverage throughout North Africa. In 1951, Jean-Claude Beton introduced Orangina's iconic signature 8-ounce bottle, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle recalls the rounded shape of an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit.\n\nProduction was moved to the city of Marseille in metropolitan France in 1962 in the run-up to Algeria's independence. Orangina was first launched in the United States in 1978 under the brand name, Orelia, which was later reverted to Orangina. The company, created by Beton, joined the Pernod Ricard group in 1984.\n\nIn 2000, the Orangina brand was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes along with Pernod Ricard's other soda businesses, after an attempt to sell to Coca-Cola was blocked on anti competitive grounds. In 2006, Cadbury plc decided to concentrate on the chocolate business and sought buyers for its soda business. As the number three soda producer globally, neither of the bigger two (Coca-Cola or PepsiCo) could buy it, so eventually the company was split up to sell.\n\nIn the United States, the brand is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (now Keurig Dr Pepper), created as a spin off of Cadbury Schweppes' former North American soft drinks business. The drink was introduced in the United States in 1978, under the name Orelia, but this name was abandoned in favor of the original in 1985. \n\nOrangina was originally produced for the North American market in Canada, but the operation was moved to Hialeah, Florida, United States, to be produced under license by Mott's LLP of Rye Brook, New York. \n\nProduction of Orangina has since moved back to Canada, as Mott's is now part of Dr Pepper Snapple (now Keurig Dr Pepper). Orangina for the market in the United States is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, instead of regular sugar like original Orangina, while the product for the Canadian market is labeled as being sweetened with glucose fructose syrup, which is merely another name for high-fructose corn syrup. In Canada, Orangina is also imported by Canada Dry Motts from Europe.\n\nFrom 2006, private equity firms Blackstone Group and Lion Capital LLP owned the brand outside North America under the company name Orangina Schweppes. In November 2009, its ownership changed once again when it was bought by Japanese brewer Suntory. In Great Britain, it was formerly manufactured under licence by A.G. Barr of Glasgow, most famous for Irn-Bru, however, this has recently been taken in house by Suntory subsidiary Lucozade Ribena Suntory \n\nOrangina is produced in Vietnam by Fosters Vietnam under licence and is sold in Carrefour branches in Taiwan. It is produced in Iran by Shemshad Noosh Co.\n\nThe brand is famous for the design of its 25 cl (8 oz) bottle made in the shape of a pear with a pebbly texture meant to recall the peel of an orange or other citrus fruit. Larger bottles also include the pebbly texture but use a more regular bottle shape rather than maintaining the proportions of the smaller bottles.\n\nNew flavours have emerged in Europe including Orangina Sanguine which is made from blood oranges and also contains caffeine and guarana. It is significantly more sour than regular Orangina. Other flavours such as the series called \"les givrés\" (which can be translated as both \"frosted\" and \"crazy\") are also available in Europe, but rarely seen in North America. The sugar free variant \"Miss O\" was launched in the 2010s. \n\nIn Tunisia, multiple flavors of Orangina are sold as Orangina Rouge, similar to the European Orangina Sanguine, and Orangina Light as a sugar free variant.\n\nIn 2010, a gay friendly Orangina commercial was released in France, a few weeks after a McDonald's advertisement featuring a gay teenager was shown on French television.\n\nIn 2015, an Orangina cinematic commercial was created by Hobby Films and directed by Vesa Manninen.\n\nIn 2008, a commercial featuring anthropomorphic animals (such as a deer, a bear, peacocks, and chameleons) in swimsuits, caused outrage in the United Kingdom, for its sexually suggestive content. In the video, the animals gyrate around poles, spray the drink onto the breasts of other animals, and ride bottles which then explode. The advert had already had 45 seconds of more provocative footage cut, and was only to be shown after the 9 o'clock watershed, initially during a programme titled \"How to Look Good Naked\".\n\nKidscape, a children's charity based in the country, criticised the advert, saying, \"Orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people, but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context\". The advert was also awarded \"Freakiest Advert of 2008\", and was seventh place in \"Worst TV Ad of 2008\".\n\nOthers claim that Orangina is not targeted just at children and is also a \"leading adult soft drink\" and that the advertisement is intended to create controversy and thus free publicity. The advertisement was popular, and by April 2008 had three million online viewings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "265806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265806", "title": "Smirnoff", "text": "Smirnoff\n\nSmirnoff (; ) is a brand of vodka owned and produced by the British company Diageo. The Smirnoff brand began with a vodka distillery founded in Moscow by Pyotr Arsenievich Smirnov (1831–1898). It is now distributed in 130 countries and produced in several countries including Albania, Brazil, Honduras, India, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Mongolia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States. Smirnoff products include vodka, flavoured vodka, and malt beverages. In March 2006, Diageo North America claimed that Smirnoff vodka was the best-selling distilled spirit brand in the world. In 2015 India's Officer's Choice overtook Smirnoff vodka to become the world's largest selling spirit brand. In 2014, Smirnoff was chosen as the best selling vodka across the world.\nThe vodka is made using a traditional charcoal filtration method developed by P.A. Smirnoff. Recipe No. 21 that was created by P.A.'s son Vladimir after escaping Russia during the October Revolution.\n\nPyotr Arsenjevitch Smirnov founded his vodka distillery in Moscow in 1864 under the trading name of PA Smirnoff, pioneering charcoal filtration in the 1870s, and becoming the first to utilize newspaper ads along with charitable contributions to the clergy to stifle anti-vodka sermons, capturing two-thirds of the Moscow market by 1886. His brand was reportedly a Tsar favorite. When Pyotr died, he was succeeded by his third son Vladimir Smirnov (1875–1939). The company flourished and produced more than 4 million cases of vodka per year.\n\nIn 1904, the Tsar nationalized the Russian vodka industry and Vladimir Smirnov was forced to sell his factory and brand. During the October Revolution of 1917, the Smirnov family had to flee the country. Vladimir Smirnov re-established a factory in 1920 in Constantinople (present day Istanbul). Four years later he moved to Lwów (formerly Poland, now Lviv, Ukraine) and started to sell the vodka under the contemporary French spelling of the name, \"Smirnoff\". The new product sold marginally well but not nearly as it had in Russia prior to 1904. An additional distillery was founded in Paris in 1925; however the company was a shadow of its former self.\n\nIn the 1930s, Vladimir met Rudolph Kunett, a Russian who had emigrated to America in the 1920s and became a successful businessman in New York City. The Kunett family had been a supplier of grains to Smirnoff in Moscow before the Revolution. In 1933, Vladimir sold Kunett the right to begin producing Smirnoff vodka in North America. He then returned to the United States, quit his sales job, and established his first North American distillery in Bethel, Connecticut, USA in 1933. However, the business in America was not as successful as Kunett had hoped. In 1938 Kunett could not afford to pay for the necessary sales licences, and contacted John Martin, president of Heublein. Heublein was a company that specialized in the import and export of liquors and foreign foods. Using the $14,000 that the Heublein company made from a new product that ended up saving them from bankruptcy, A.1. Steak Sauce, Martin bought the rights to Smirnoff in 1939. His board thought he was mad. Americans were traditionally whiskey drinkers unfamiliar with vodka and so sales were very slow. In a marketing move they changed the product to use whiskey corks instead and branded it as a \"white whiskey\" with \"no taste, no smell\". Sales picked up considerably after that.\n\nIn 1982, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company acquired Heublein Inc. for $1.4 billion. RJR Nabisco sold the division to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. In 1985 Heublein Corporate Audit Manager Hanson J Kan had recommended to Heublein that they buy out the Grand Metropolitan IDV Smirnoff licensee with its global licensee locations. Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness to form Diageo in 1997.\n\nIn 1990, after the Berlin Wall was demolished, Helmut Kohl made a deal with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev allowing the reunification of Germany provided that the Soviet army could remain in East Germany, due to a pre-existing security agreement between the German Democratic Republic and the USSR; such arrangements were to be paid by West Germany for three years. Suddenly, 500,000 Soviet soldiers were paid in hard currency and had almost nothing to do except drink. They then proceeded to spend their currency on Marlboro cigarettes, Levi jeans and Smirnoff vodka. The US-made variety of Smirnoff vodka was especially popular.\n\nThe London office of Heublein was inundated with orders and the Vice President, Jeremy Collis, set about exploiting this \"gusher\" to the fullest extent possible. Huge in-store Smirnoff displays were set up in the Russian army stores and the officers' messes were renamed Smirnoff Clubs. Individual messes started serving in excess of 200 litres a night of Smirnoff. The Soviet forces became the biggest market in Europe for Smirnoff outside the UK. Smirnoff was shipped to Germany at the rate of 20,000 bottles a day. Moskovskaya and Stolichnaya's market share in Germany dropped from 100% to almost nothing.\n\nSeeing the popularity of Smirnoff amongst the Russian troops, Collis set about trying to sell Smirnoff vodka directly into the USSR. The entire vodka market in the Western world at that stage was 60 million cases (Source: M. Shanken Publications: \"Impact\" 1991) but the USSR market was believed to be over 200 million cases (Source: \"Impact\"1991). The first containers were shipped into Leningrad in 1991 where Collis had appointed a distributor, Empire Brands Inc.\n\nIn 1985, Heublein Corporate Audit Manager Hanson J Kan recommended to Heublein that they buy out the Grand Metropolitan IDV Smirnoff licensee with its global licensee locations. But in 1987, Grand Met bought out Heublein including the global Smirnoff operations from RJR Nabisco.\n\nEmpire Brands was established by Sergey Titov, a former interpreter with no prior commercial experience. In Soviet Russia almost no one had 'commercial experience' so Titov became a model for expanding distribution across the country. Collis went from town to town trying to find suitable individuals who could be taught how business worked - buying, warehousing, distributing and selling at a profit. The plan was to establish approved distributors in each major town and give them exclusive rights for that town because there were numerous towns with populations over 100,000 which each had the potential to be as large a market for Smirnoff vodka as the whole of Belgium or The Netherlands or a US state the size of Connecticut. Outside the Soviet state apparatus, there were no national organisations that could market and distribute Smirnoff.\n\nThe demand for Smirnoff vodka was such that if properly managed and the opportunity grasped, the Russian market alone could double the size of IDV, already the biggest drinks company in the world. The Communists had banned Smirnoff from Russia for seventy years and in the most extreme example of 'denial marketing' this had created both awareness and demand on an extraordinary scale. Every Russian had heard of Smirnoff vodka and everyone thought it must be the best because they weren't allowed to have it. Collis believed that in 1991, selling Smirnoff in the USSR represented the biggest opportunity for a consumer product in the history of marketing. But he then made a big mistake by telling this to the Board of IDV. As a consequence, every director in IDV wanted to be part of this amazing success story and Collis found himself being squeezed out by other directors with no knowledge or experience of either the USSR or the brand. One director in particular managed to persuade the Board that exclusive distribution rights should be given to one man in Moscow - a Greek mafioso character called Spiros with no marketing or distribution experience, staff, or infrastructure. Many people subsequently believed that major corruption must have been involved. This appointment proved disastrous as established customers were cut off from buying Smirnoff unless they made illegal hard currency payments to Spiros's company.\n\nDuring the 1990s one of Piotr Smirnov's descendants started producing Smirnov (Смирновъ) vodka in Russia, claiming to be \"The Only Real Smirnov\". After a number of lawsuits, Smirnoff successfully reclaimed its trademark, while in 2006 Diageo concluded a joint venture deal with the Smirnov company.\n\nThe Smirnoff company had the naming rights to the Smirnoff Music Centre, a concert amphitheater in Dallas, Texas from 2000-08. They also sponsored the Smirnoff Underbelly, a major venue at the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\nIn the late-1990s, Smirnoff introduced a series of new products onto the UK and later the European and North American market, which quickly became popular among young people, especially within the club scene (See \"\"Alcopops\"\").\n\nThere are two different products by the name of \"Smirnoff Ice\". One, sold in France and the United States, is a citrus-flavoured malt beverage (5.0% ABV) with variants in \"Original,\" and \"Triple Black.\" The other, sold in Europe (excluding France), Latin America, Australia and Canada, is a premixed vodka drink. It also has variants in \"Original\" and \"Black Ice\" (or in some markets, \"Triple Black\" or \"Double Black\"), ranging from 4.5% in the UK, to 7% ABV in different markets.\n\nThe Smirnoff Ice marketed in the United States does not actually contain vodka according to the official Smirnoff website. It is more similar to beer than to vodka, primarily because it is brewed. However outside of the USA and countries who receive US manufactured vodka it does contain Smirnoff Vodka No. 21.\n\n\"Smirnoff Ice Twisted\" was a spin-off of the American Smirnoff Ice that featured flavors such as Mandarin Orange and Green Apple. The confusion in branding between Smirnoff Twist Vodka and Smirnoff Twisted Malt Beverage resulted in the decision to drop the \"Twisted\" from the flavored line of Smirnoff Ice. Current Smirnoff Ice flavors include Watermelon, Wild Grape, Passionfruit, Mango, Triple Black, Pomegranate Fusion, Arctic Berry (Blueberry), Green Apple Bite, Strawberry Acai, Pineapple and Raspberry Burst. It is sold in 22 oz. [650 ml] bottles and six-packs of 12 oz. [355 ml] bottles.\n\nThe next line of Smirnoff's malt beverages to be produced was \"Raw Teas\", similar to the brand Twisted Tea. It comes in flavors such as Lemon, Peach, Raspberry and Green Tea. This product line has been marketed most notably with the \"Tea Partay\" music video and website. It is sold in six-packs of 12 oz. [355 ml] bottles.\n\n\"Smirnoff Source\", a lightly carbonated beer-alternative, was released in May 2007. It is citrus-flavoured and made with alcohol (3.5% ABV) and spring water and is sold in 4-packs of 1-quart [947 ml] bottles.\n\nA line of 22 flavoured vodkas (based on the No.21 Red Label) with the \"Twist\" moniker appended on the end of the name have also been introduced. Flavours include Green Apple, Orange, Cranberry, Raspberry, Citrus (Lemon), Vanilla, Strawberry, Black Cherry, Watermelon, Lime, Blueberry, White Grape, Melon (Honeydew/Cantaloupe), Pomegranate, Passion Fruit, Pear, Peach, Pineapple, Mango, Coconut, and most recently Amaretto.\n\nIn 2004, Smirnoff trialled a new blend of vodka in the UK and Canada called Smirnoff Penka. Marketing and distribution was handled by The Reserve Brands of Diageo plc. Penka continues to be available in the UK.\n\nIn a 2005 \"New York Times\" blind tasting of 21 world-class vodkas, Smirnoff won as the \"hands-down favorite\".\n\nIn 2010, Smirnoff introduced the Cocktail Range. Pomegranate Martini with Meyer Lemon-flavoured Liquor and pomegranate juice, Mojito with a dash of mint and Kaffir lime and Grand Cosmopolitan with cranberry juice. Tuscan Lemonade and Savannah Tea were later added.\n\nA study in 2013, shows that Smirnoff malt beverages were the second-most popular brand specific alcohols consumed by underage youths in the United States. Smirnoff malt beverages (17.0%, 95% CI 12.9 to 21.1%).\n\nThe latest addition is the Smirnoff Sours vodkas, introduced in 2014. Flavors available are Fruit Punch, Watermelon, Green Apple, and Berry Lemon.\n\nIn 2016, Smirnoff introduced two new Smirnoff Ice flavors: Electric Mandarin and Electric Berry. Also in 2016, Smirnoff introduced the new Spiked line, available in Original, Screwdriver and Hurricane Punch, as well as their Sourced line of fruit juice vodka, available in Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pineapple and Cranberry Apple.\n\nMost Smirnoff products have an identifying number that is displayed on the label. Some of these numbers are:\n\nThe basic Smirnoff vodka — number 21 — has performed well at spirit ratings competitions. It was awarded a double gold medal (the highest award) at the 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.\n\nThese are numbered Smirnoff vodkas with flavouring added.\n\n\nSome Smirnoff products do not have a number on the label.\n\n\n\n\n\"Smirnov\" () can be seen as the Russian version of Smirnoff vodka. It is made by the Smirnov Trading House, a company that is part of a joint venture by Russia's Alfa Group and Diageo set up in February 2006. The full title of the Smirnov Trading House is \"The Trading House of the Heirs of P.A. Smirnov\".\n\nSmirnov vodka was launched in 1991 by Boris Smirnov, a scion of Pyotr Smirnov, the original producer of the spirit. It was first labeled as a \"table wine\" rather than a vodka to avoid any conflict with Smirnoff. After many lawsuits, which resulted in Diageo's brand being temporarily banned in the Commonwealth of Independent States from 2002 to 2006, the Russian brand became a \"sister product\" of Smirnoff vodka.\n\nThe label lists 1860 (the year Pyotr's father Arseniy founded their first wine cellar in Moscow), rather than 1864 (the year Pyotr founded his first vodka distillery), as the founding date of the company. Their premier brand \"Smirnov Titul\"' has the year 1886 on the label, the year P.A. Smirnov received the title of \"Purveyor to the Imperial Court\" - making them the exclusive providers of vodka to the Tsar.\n\nIn 2017, model Chrissy Teigen starred in video ads for Smirnoff vodka.\n\nThese are not to be confused with Smirnoff's Red-, Gold-, and Black-label vodkas.\n\n"}

Traditionally, it referred to burials, but also to other celebrations in some dialects. \n\nKarhunpeijaiset is a celebration after a bear hunt. A bear was never \"hunted\"; it was merely \"brought down\". A single man could claim to have hunted and killed a bear, but in a community effort, the bear simply died. The ceremony was always a much more elaborate affair than the most influential member of the community would have merited. In eastern Finland it would have copious mourners and wailers, and the people would address the bear as a relative or as the son of a god. Its flesh was not eaten — that would have been cannibalism — or, if it was, an elaborate show was made to symbolically render the meat into that of another animal, e.g. venison. The bear's head was usually mounted on the top of a young tree, or on a pike. Carrion-eaters would then eat it, leaving only the skull, which would then become an object of veneration. A courtyard would also be cleared around the skull. Traditionally, only bears were sanctified thus.\n\nSometimes the ceremony was held as a sacred marriage rather than a burial. In such cases the bear was either propped up inside a frame or strapped to a cross. With all due ceremony, the chosen bride or groom would symbolically marry the bear. \n\nNowadays \"peijaiset\" usually means the festivities ending a successful hunt or hunting season, usually only for moose and bear. On many occasions these include making a meal of the latest kill for hunters in the evening.\n\nSimilar customs have been reported from many other northern people who share their habitat with bears.\n\n"}
{"id": "268991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=268991", "title": "Chow mein", "text": "Chow mein\n\nChow mein (and , ) are Chinese stir-fried noodles, the name being the romanization of the Taishanese chāu-mèing. The dish is popular throughout the Chinese diaspora and appears on the menus of most Chinese restaurants. It is particularly popular in India, Nepal, the UK and the US.\n\nThe words chow mein mean 'stir-fried noodles', \"chow\" meaning 'stir-fried' (or \"sautéed\") and \"mein\" meaning 'noodles'. The pronunciation \"chow mein\" is an English corruption of the Taishanese pronunciation \"chāu-mèing\". The lightly pronounced Taishanese , resembling the end of a Portuguese nasal vowel, was taken to be by English speakers. The Taishan dialect was spoken by migrants to North America from Taishan.\n\nIn American Chinese cuisine, it is a stir-fried dish consisting of noodles, meat (chicken being most common but pork, beef, shrimp or tofu sometimes being substituted), onions and celery. It is often served as a specific dish at westernized Chinese restaurants. Vegetarian or vegan Chow Mein is also common.\n\nThere are two main kinds of chow meins available on the market:\nThe steamed chow mein has a softer texture, while the latter is crisper and drier. Crispy chow mein uses fried, flat noodles, while soft chow mein uses long, rounded noodles.\n\nCrispy chow mein has either onions and celery in the finished dish or is served \"strained\", without any vegetables. Steamed chow mein can have many different kinds of vegetables in the finished dish, most commonly including onions and celery but sometimes carrots, cabbage and mung bean sprouts as well. Crispy chow mein is usually topped with a thick brown sauce, while steamed chow mein is mixed with soy sauce before being served.\n\nThere is a regional difference in the US between the East and West Coast use of the term \"chow mein\". On the East Coast, \"chow mein\" is always the crispy or \"Hong Kong style\". At some restaurants located in those areas, the crispy chow mein noodles are sometimes deep fried and could be crispy \"like the ones in cans\" or \"fried as crisp as hash browns\". At a few East Coast locations, \"chow mein\" is also served over rice. There, the steamed style using soft noodles is a separate dish called \"lo mein\". On the West Coast, \"chow mein\" is always the steamed style; the crispy style is simply called \"Hong Kong style\" and the term \"lo mein\" is not widely used.\n\nThe crispy version of chow mein can also be served in a hamburger-style bun as a chow mein sandwich.\n\nThere are also variations on how either one of the two main types of chow mein can be prepared as a dish. When ordering \"chow mein\" in some restaurants in Chicago, a diner might receive \"chop suey poured over crunchy fried noodles\". In Philadelphia, Americanized chow mein tends to be similar to chop suey but has crispy fried noodles on the side and includes lots of celery and bean sprouts and is sometimes accompanied with fried rice. Jeremy Iggers of the \"Star Tribune\" describes \"Minnesota-style chow mein\" as \"a green slurry of celery and ground pork topped with ribbons of gray processed chicken\". Bay Area journalist William Wong made a similar comment about what is sold as chow mein in places like Minnesota. A published recipe for Minnesota-style chow mein includes generous portions of celery and bean sprouts. Another Minnesotan variant includes ground beef and cream of mushroom soup.\n\nFood historians and cultural anthropologists have noted that chow mein and other dishes served in Chinese American restaurants located away from areas without any significant Asian American population tend to be very different from what is served in China and are heavily modified to fit the taste preference of the local dominant population. As an example, the chow mein gravy favored in the Fall River area more closely resembles that used in local New England cooking than that used in traditional Chinese cooking. The founder of the food manufacturer Chun King and the creator of canned chow mein admits of using Italian spices to make his product more acceptable to Americans whose ancestors came from Europe.\n\nChow mein is mentioned as early as 1920, in the novel \"Main Street\" by Sinclair Lewis.\n\nIt is frequently confused with chop suey; a dish incorrectly labeled as chow mein was sometimes served in American restaurants, drug store soda fountains, school cafeterias, senior citizens facilities, and military bases chow halls. In many of these cases, this particular dish was served over rice and did not include noodles.\n\nIn 1946, one of the first companies to market \"chow mein\" in a can was Chun King. The product's creator was Jeno Paulucci, the son of Italian immigrants, who developed a recipe based mostly upon Italian spices that would be better catered to the food preferences of European immigrants and some Americans of similar ethnic origins. To keep cost down, Paulucci ingeniously substituted expensive water chestnuts with lower cost celery stalks that were originally destined for cattle feed. Paulucci's company became so successful selling canned chow mein and chop suey that President Gerald Ford quipped \"What could be more American than a business built on a good Italian recipe for chop suey?\" when praising Paulucci accomplishments with Chun King. After Paulucci sold Chun King in 1966, the company would be sold several more times more until it was dissolved in 1995.\n\nBy 1960, Paulucci described in \"The New York Times\" that \"At Chun King we have turned out a 'stew-type' chow mein. I'd guess this type has been around for thirty - maybe forty - years. To make it, all the meat, seasonings and vegetables are dumped into a kettle and stewed for hours - until everything is cooked.\" At the time of the interview, \"sales from restaurants 'to take home' are almost three times as great as in the food markets\". Paulucci wanted to increase market share by using more effective advertising.\n\nTraditional chow mein is made with egg noodles which are boiled then strained and left to dry. They are then stir fried and finally left to sit at the bottom of the wok and pressed down, this crisps the noodles at the edges and underside. Chow mein is made with either seafood, often just prawns, chicken, beef or barbecued pork. Restaurants will serve a combination chow mein or a single type. Chicken and beef are often softened with a little bicarbonate of soda. The sauce is made from garlic, rice wine, light stock, MSG, salt and corn flour. Vegetables are usually one green such as bok choy or choy sum plus a little chopped carrot, but also other green vegetables are acceptable. This stir fry is poured onto the noodles. Chow mein is unique as its noodles are both soft in part but also crispy.\n\nChow mein was brought to Brazil by Japanese immigrants and is thus referred as yakisoba (). It fits Brazilian tastes rather than Japanese ones though, and is thus more similar to the North American versions of chow mein.\n\n\"Pastelarias\" and Asian restaurants serve it in the entire country. They generally are presented in chicken (the most common), beef, shrimp and pork versions, with vegetarian and egg versions being much rarer. Brazilian \"yakisoba\" is typically served much more \"al dente\" than the Japanese, being also heavy in soy sauce, sesame oil, and vegetables, almost always including at least carrot, cabbage, onion and at least one dark green species (usually \"other\" than kale, collard, spinach, chicory or mustard) such as Chinese cabbage, and less often either bean sprouts, broccoli/broccolini, zucchini, shiitake, bell pepper and/or cucumber.\n\nAlso popular is \"yakibifum\" (, from Japanese \"yakibīfun\"), its equivalent that uses rice vermicelli instead of wheat noodles. Brazilian spring rolls' (\"rolinhos-primavera\" or \"harumakis\") fillings generally use the same ingredients of the stir-fried noodles in the restaurants or fast-food chains they are found, though spring rolls may have cheese, usually white (such as \"catupiry\" or other kinds of \"requeijão\", or \"queijo minas\"), or tofu instead of meat, uncommon for the noodles. All of them, but most often and especially spring rolls, may be served with bright red \"molho agridoce\" (sweet-sour sauce), that combines ketchup, vinegar, sugar, star anise and other spices.\n\nCanadian westernized Chinese restaurants may offer up to three different types of chow mein, none of which is identical to either of the two types of American chow mein. \"Cantonese style chow mein\" contains deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles, green peppers, pea pods, bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, shrimp, Chinese roast pork (\"char siu\"), chicken, and beef, and is served in a thick sauce. Plain \"chow mein\" is similar to other Western chow meins but contains far more mung bean sprouts; some regional recipes may substitute bean sprouts for noodles completely. In Canada, \"Hong Kong style chow mein\" is similar to plain chow mein but is always served on a bed of deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles. The Japanese Canadian community also have their own version of chow mein that might include dried seaweed and pickle ginger and could be served in a bun.\n\nMany West Indian people include chow mein in their cuisine, especially peoples from islands like Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica which include a significant ethnic Chinese population; much of the cooking has infused itself into the population in general. As well, in the South American countries Guyana and Suriname the culture and cuisine is similar to the Caribbean's. These chow mein dishes are cooked in a similar manner, with green beans, carrots, peas, onions and sometimes other vegetables. Meat used is mostly chicken and sometimes pork and/or shrimp. The main difference is that local spices are added, and the dish is often served with hot Scotch bonnet peppers and/or pepper sauce.\n\nIn Cuba, aside from the foreign owned tourist hotels which often serve Western-style Chinese food, local Chinese restaurants can be found in Havana that offer a distinct Cuban style.\n\nIn Panama, chow mein is prepared with a mixture of shredded carrots and cabbage with pork or chicken and served over noodles. Another recipe includes canned corn.\n\nChow mein is also common in Indian Chinese, Bangladeshi Chinese, and Pakistani Chinese cuisine. In India, it was introduced by the Chinese of Calcutta. It is usually offered \"Hakka\" or with gravy. Catering to vegetarian diets, there is an Indian variant, vegetable chow mein, which consists of noodles with cabbage, bamboo shoots, pea pods, green peppers, and carrots. In the New Delhi area, chow mein can sometimes include paneer with the mixture of noodles and vegetables. Another non-meat Indian variant includes scrambled egg as a protein source. Kolkata has its own variant that is called \"Calcutta Chow Mein\" or \"Calcutta Chowmin\" that also includes green chilli, chilli garlic, or hot garlic.\n\nChow mein has gained popularity in Mexico, which received waves of Chinese immigrants in the past, particularly in northwestern Mexico. Mexicali, a city in Baja California, is known for its distinct style of chow mein, which typically use Mexican ingredients as substitutes for traditional Chinese ones, an adaption that was made by Chinese immigrants settling the area.\n\nTibetans who settled in Nepal brought chow mein with them. It is a popular fast food in Nepal. The Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley use water buffalo meat and chicken in their cuisine, and chow mein in Nepal is often cooked with onion, vegetables and buff (water buffalo meat).\n\nChinese food (Chifa) is very popular in Peru and is now a part of mainstream Peruvian culture. Chow mein is known to Peruvians as \"Tallarín salteado\" and may contain peppers, onions, green onions, and tomatoes.\n\n"}

The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.\n\nIn northern Europe and Scandinavia the term \"café au lait\" has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk. In France, \"caffè latte\" is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caffè latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \"latte\" is in French called \"grand crème\" and in German \"Milchkaffee\" or (in Austria) \"Wiener Melange\".\n\nVariants include the chocolate-flavored mocha, or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric, or rooibos and other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.\n\nCoffee and milk have been part of European cuisine since the 17th century. \"Caffè latte\", \"Milchkaffee\", \"café au lait\" and \"café con leche\" are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public cafés in Europe and the US it seems have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although \"Kapuziner\" is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the 2nd half of 1700s as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\" (being the origin of the Italian cappuccino).\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the term \"caffè latte\" was first used in English in 1867 by William Dean Howells in his essay \"Italian Journeys\". Kenneth Davids maintains that \"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caffè version of this drink is an American invention\". The French term \"café au lait\" was used in cafés in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term \"café crème\" for coffee with milk or cream.\n\nThe Austrian-Hungarian empire (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called \"Milchkaffee\". The Italians used the term \"caffè latte\" domestically, but it is not known from cafés like \"Florian\" in Venice or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, \"espresso\" and \"cappuccino\" are the terms, \"latte\" is missing on coffee menus.\n\nIn Italian \"latte\" () means \"milk\"—so ordering a \"latte\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.\n\nIn Spanish the phrase \"café con leche\" (coffee with milk) is used; by default this will be in a small cup.\n\nIn English-speaking countries \"latte\" is shorthand for \"caffelatte\" or \"caffellatte\" (from \"caffè e latte\", \"coffee and milk\"), which is similar to the French \"café au lait\", the Spanish \"café con leche\", the Catalan \"cafè amb llet\" or the Portuguese \"galão.\"\n\nThe Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \"invented\" and \"made the latte a standard drink\" in the 1950s. The latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington in the early 1980s and spread more widely in the early 1990s.\n\nIn northern Europe and Scandinavia, a similar \"trend\" started in the early 1980s as \"café au lait\" became popular again, prepared with espresso and steamed milk. \"Caffè latte\" started replacing this term around 1996–97, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation.\n\nCoffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is \"caffellatte\" (the standard form; \"caffelatte\" is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from \"caffè latte\" (with a grave accent over the e), while French is \"café au lait\" (with an acute accent); Spanish is \"café con leche\" and Portuguese is \"café com leite\". Variants such as \"café latte\", \"café latté\" and \"café lattè\" are commonly seen in English.\n\nIn Italy, caffè latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop moka pot and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all).\n\nOutside Italy, a caffè latte is typically prepared in a glass or cup with one standard shot of espresso (either single, , or double, ) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar.\n\nThe drink is related to a cappuccino, the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the flat white, which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino.\n\nIn the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice. Unlike a hot latte, it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam. Iced lattes almost always have sugar or flavoring syrups added, and are sometimes served blended with the ice. The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid warming up the drink.\n\nA caffè latte differs from a latte macchiato. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caffè lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.\n\nThe latte macchiato is milk steamed to microfoam, served in a glass with a half shot of espresso poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \"macchia\"—a spot—of espresso on the top. As with a caffè macchiato, which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk.\n\nThe use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \"macchiato\" itself is Italian for \"stained\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \"stain\" in the drink.\n\nAlthough the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caffè macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caffè macchiato is about and is usually served in a demi tasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream.\n\nCalling people \"latte drinkers\" pejoratively has become a common political attack in Western cultures. The popularity of espresso drinking in large cities, especially among more affluent urban populations, has caused some to consider it elitist behavior. In the United States, conservative political commentators have been known to call their opponents \"latte-drinking liberal elites.\" In Canadian politics, latte drinking is used to portray people as out-of-touch intellectuals and the antithesis of the Tim Hortons coffee drinker that is considered representative of an ordinary Canadian. In Scandinavian politics, the term \"the caffè latte segment\" is used to describe elitist voters.\n\n"}

{"id": "270044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270044", "title": "Shedim", "text": "Shedim\n\nShedim () are spirits or demons in early Jewish mythology. However, they are not necessarily equivalent to the modern connotation of demons as evil entities. Evil spirits were thought as the cause of maladies; conceptual differing from the shedim, who are not evil demigods, but the foreign gods themselves. Shedim are just evil in the sense that they are \"not God\". \n\nThey appear only twice (always plural) in the Tanakh, at Psalm 106:37 and Deuteronomy 32:17 both times, it deals with child or animal sacrifices. Although the word is traditionally derived from the root ( \"shûd\") that conveys the meaning of \"acting with violence\" or \"laying waste\" it was possibly a loan-word from Akkadian in which the word shedu referred to a protective, benevolent spirit. The word may also derive from the \"Sedim, Assyrian guard spirits\" as referenced according to lore \"Azazel slept with Naamah and spawned Assyrian guard spirits known as sedim\". With the translation of Hebew texts into Greek, under influence of Zorastrian dualism, \"shedim\" were translated into \"daimonia\" with implicit negativity. Otherwise, later in Judeo-Islamic culture, \"shedim\" became the Hebrew word for \"Jinn\" with a morally ambivalent attitude.\n\nAccording to one legend, the \"shedim\" are descendants of serpents, or of demons in the form of serpents, alluding to the serpent in Eden as related in Genesis. To others they are descendants of Adam and Lilith. Another legend said that God had started making them, intending for them to be humans, but did not complete their creation because He was resting during the Sabbath. Even after the Sabbath, He left them how they were to show that when the Sabbath comes, all work must be viewed as complete.\n\n\"Shedim\" are said to have had the feet and claws of a rooster and share some characteristics both of humans and angels. Like angels, they know the future and have wings, but like humans they eat, drink, procreate and die. They can also cause sickness and misfortune.\n\nSupposedly, sinful people sacrificed their daughters to the shedim, but it is unclear if the sacrifice consisted in the murdering of the victims or in the sexual satisfaction of the demons. To see if the shedim were present in some place, ashes were thrown to the ground or floor, and then their footsteps became visible.\n\nThe \"shedim\" are supposed to follow the dead or fly around graves.\n\nThere are many things that one is admonished not to do in order to avoid invoking \"shedim\", such as whistling or even saying the word \"shedim\". Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg wrote in his will and testament that one should not seal up windows completely because it traps \"shedim\" in the house.\n\nThe shedim are not always seen as malicious creatures and are also considered to be helpful to humans. They are said to be even able to live according to the Torah, like Asmodeus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "271601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=271601", "title": "Mangaka", "text": "Mangaka\n\nMost mangaka study at an art college or manga school, or take on an apprenticeship with another artist before entering the industry as a primary creator. More rarely a mangaka breaks into the industry directly, without previously being an assistant. For example, Naoko Takeuchi, author of \"Sailor Moon\", won a contest sponsored by Kodansha, and manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka was first published while studying an unrelated degree, without working as an assistant.\n\nA mangaka will rise to prominence through recognition of their ability when they spark the interest of institutions, individuals or a demographic of manga consumers. For example, there are contests which prospective mangaka may enter, sponsored by manga editors and publishers. This can also be accomplished through producing a one-shot. While sometimes a stand alone manga, with enough positive reception it can be serialized in a weekly, monthly, or quarterly format. They are also recognized for the number of manga they run at one time. \n\nThe word can be broken down into two parts: and .\n\nThe manga corresponds to the medium of art the artist uses: comics, or Japanese comics, depending on how the term is used inside or outside Japan.\n\nThe -\"ka\" (家) suffix implies a degree of expertise and traditional authorship. For example, this term would not be applied to a writer creating a story which is then handed over to a manga artist for drawing. The Japanese term for such a writer of comics is .\n\nIn a 2010 message from, at the time chairman, Takashi Yanase it says: \"[w]hile Japan is often said to be world's cartoon kingdom, not a few people will surely be wondering what exactly the Japanese mean by the term 'cartoon'. Unfortunately, there is no hard-and-fast definition that can be offered, since the members of this association lay claim to an extensive variety of works.\"\n\nWhile Japan does have a thriving independent comic market for amateur and semi-professional artists, creating manga professionally is rarely a solo effort. Mangaka must work with an assortment of others to get their work completed, published, and into the hands of readers.\n\nMost professionally published mangaka work with an editor, who is considered the boss of the mangaka and supervises series production. The editor gives advice on the layout and art of the manga, vets the story direction and pace, ensures that deadlines are met, and generally makes sure that the manga stays up to company standards. An example of this is Akira Toriyama and his former editor Kazuhiko Torishima. The editor may also function as a brand manager and publicist for a series. When a manga is the basis for a media franchise, the editor may also supervise the designs for licensed merchandise, anime adaptations, and similar products, though this duty may also fall to the mangaka or an agent.\n\nA mangaka may both write and illustrate a series of their own creation, or may work in collaboration with an author. The mangaka typically has a strong influence on dialog even when paired with a writer, as any conversation must fit within the physical constraints imposed by the art. Takeshi Obata of \"Death Note\", Tetsuo Hara of \"Fist of the North Star\", Ryoichi Ikegami of \"Sanctuary\", Aki Shirou and Hajime Kamoshida of \"Sakura-sō no Pet na Kanojo\" are all successful manga artists who have worked with writers through the majority of their careers.\n\nMost mangaka have assistants who help them complete their work in a clean and timely manner. The duties of assistants vary widely, as the term incorporates all people working for a mangaka's art studio, but is most commonly used to refer to secondary artists. The number of assistant artists also varies widely between mangaka, but is typically at least three. Other mangaka instead form collaborative groups known as \"circles\" but do not use additional assistants, such as the creative team CLAMP. A few mangaka have no assistants at all, and prefer to do everything themselves, but this is considered exceptional.\n\nAssistants are commonly used for inking, lettering, and shading, though the predominance of black and white art in manga means that unlike in the western comic industry, a studio rarely employs a colorist. Some mangaka only do the sketchwork for their art, and have their numerous assistants fill in all of the details, but it is more common for assistants to deal with background and cameo art, leaving the mangaka to focus on drawing and inking the characters. Assistants may also be employed to perform specialized artistic tasks. Go Nagai, for instance, at one time employed a specialist to draw helicopters and other military vehicles, Kaoru Mori employed a historical consultant for \"Emma\", and series that incorporates photorealistic architecture, animals, computer-rendered imagery, or other technically demanding effects may employ or contract separate artists trained in those techniques. Assistants almost never help the mangaka with the plot of their manga, beyond being a sounding board for ideas. A mangaka's assistants might be listed in the credits for a manga tankōbon, and short interviews with or illustrations by assistant artists are a common form of bonus material in these collections, but they typically do not receive individual credits.\n\nMost mangaka started out as assistants, such as Miwa Ueda to Naoko Takeuchi, Leiji Matsumoto to Osamu Tezuka, Kaoru Shintani to Leiji Matsumoto, and Eiichiro Oda, Hiroyuki Takei and Mikio Itō to Nobuhiro Watsuki, who was himself an assistant to Takeshi Obata. It is also possible for an assistant to have an entire career as such without becoming an independent mangaka. Assistants, particularly specialists, may work with several different mangaka at the same time, and many assistants also self-publish works of their own in the dōjinshi scene.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "274738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=274738", "title": "Wali", "text": "Wali\n\nWalī (, plural ) is an Arabic word whose literal meanings include \"custodian\", \"protector\", \"helper\", and \"friend\". In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic saint, otherwise referred to by the more literal \"friend of God\". In the traditional Islamic understanding of saints, the saint is portrayed as someone \"marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness\", and who is specifically \"chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles\". The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history, and particular verses of the Quran and certain hadith were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as \"documentary evidence\" of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage — especially after 1200 CE — for masses of Muslims seeking their \"barakah\" (blessing).\n\nSince the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when the Islamic mystical trend of Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in orthodox Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like Hasan of Basra (d. 728), Farqad Sabakhi (d. 729), Dawud Tai (d. 777–781), Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya (d. 801), Maruf Karkhi (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910). From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, \"the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods\". In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be \"a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples\". In many prominent Sunni Islamic creeds of the time, such as the famous \"Creed of Tahawi\" (c. 900) and the \"Creed of Nasafi\" (c. 1000), a belief in the existence and miracles of saints was presented as \"a requirement\" for being an orthodox Muslim believer.\n\nAside from the Sufis, the preeminent saints in traditional Islamic piety are the Companions of Muhammad, their Successors, and the third generation after the Prophet, often called \"the Successors of the Successors\". Additionally, the prophets of Islam are also believed to be saints by definition, although they are rarely referred to as such, in order to prevent confusion between them and ordinary saints; as the prophets are exalted by Muslims as the greatest of all humanity, it is a general tenet of Sunni belief that a single prophet is greater than all the regular saints put together. In short, it is believed that \"every prophet is a saint, but not every saint is a prophet\".\n\nIn the modern world, the traditional Sunni and Shia idea of saints has been challenged by movements such as Salafism, Wahhabism, and Islamic modernism, all three of which have, to a greater or lesser degree, \"formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints.\" As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements has indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to resist \"acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations\". However, despite the presence of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital role in daily expressions of piety among vast segments of Muslim populations in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.\n\nRegarding the rendering of the Arabic \"walī\" by the English \"saint\", prominent scholars such as Gibril Haddad have regarded this as an appropriate translation, with Haddad describing the aversion of some Muslims towards the use of \"saint\" for \"walī\" as \"a specious objection ... for [this is] – like 'Religion' (\"din\"), 'Believer' (\"mu'min\"), 'prayer' (\"salat\"), etc. – [a] generic term for holiness and holy persons while there is no confusion, for Muslims, over their specific referents in Islam, namely: the reality of \"iman\" with Godwariness and those who possess those qualities.\" In Persian, which became the second most influential and widely-spoken language in the Islamic world after Arabic, the general title for a saint or a spiritual master became \"pīr\" (, literally \"old [person]\", \"elder\"). Although the ramifications of this phrase include the connotations of a general \"saint,\" it is often used to specifically signify a spiritual guide of some type.\n\nAmongst Indian Muslims, the title \"peer baba\" (पीर बाबा) is commonly used in Hindi to refer to Sufi masters or similarly honored saints. Additionally, saints are also sometimes referred to in the Persian or Urdu vernacular with \"Hazrat.\" In Islamic mysticism, a \"pīr's\" role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the mystical path. Hence, the key difference between the use of \"walī\" and \"pīr\" is that the former does not imply a saint who is also a spiritual master with disciples, whilst the latter directly does so through its connotations of \"elder.\" Additionally, other Arabic and Persian words that also often have the same connotations as \"pīr\", and hence are also sometimes translated into English as \"saint\", include \"murshid\" (, meaning \"guide\" or \"teacher\"), \"sheikh\" and \"sarkar\" (Persian word meaning \"master\").\n\nIn the Turkish Islamic lands, saints have been referred to by many terms, including the Arabic \"walī\", the Persian \"s̲h̲āh\" and \"pīr\", and Turkish alternatives like \"baba\" in Anatolia, \"ata\" in Central Asia (both meaning \"father\"), as well as \"eren\" or \"ermis̲h̲\" (< ermek \"to reach, attain\") or \"yati̊r\" (\"one who settles down\") in Anatolia. Their tombs, meanwhile, are \"denoted by terms of Arabic or Persian origin alluding to the idea of pilgrimage (\"mazār\", \"ziyāratgāh\"), tomb (\"ḳabr\", \"maḳbar\") or domed mausoleum (\"gunbad\", \"ḳubba\"). But such tombs are also denoted by terms usually used for dervish convents, or a particular part of it (\"tekke\" in the Balkans, \"langar\", 'refectory,' and \"ribāṭ\" in Central Asia), or by a quality of the saint (\"pīr\", 'venerable, respectable,' in Azerbaijan).\"\n\nAccording to various traditional Sufi interpretations of the Quran, the concept of sainthood is clearly described. Some modern scholars, however, assert that the Quran does not \"explicitly\" outline a doctrine or theory of saints. In the Quran, the adjective \"walī\" is applied to God, in the sense of Him being the \"friend\" of all believers (2:257). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people. These included 10:62: \"Surely God's friends (\"awliyāa l-lahi\"): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,\" and 5:54, which refers to God's love for those who love Him. Additionally, some scholars interpreted 4:69, \"Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the \"ṣidīqīna\" and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they,\" to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter. The word \"ṣidīqīna\" in this verse literally connotes \"the truthful ones\" or \"the just ones,\" and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of \"saints,\" with the famous Quran translator Marmaduke Pickthall rendering it as \"saints\" in their interpretations of the scripture. Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like Khidr (18:65-82) and the People of the Cave (18:7-26), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God. The references in the corpus of hadith literature to \"bona fide\" saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲, only lent further credence to this early understanding of saints.\n\nCollected stories about the \"lives or \"vitae\" of the saints\", began to be compiled \"and transmitted at an early stage\" by many regular Muslim scholars, including Ibn Abi al-Dunya (d. 894), who wrote a work entitled \"Kitāb al-Awliyāʾ\" (\"Lives of the Saints\") in the ninth-century, which constitutes \"the earliest [complete] compilation on the theme of God's friends.\" Prior to Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work, the stories of the saints were transmitted through oral tradition; but after the composition of his work, many Islamic scholars began writing down the widely circulated accounts, with later scholars like Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 948) making extensive use of Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work in his own \"Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ\" (\"The Adornment of the Saints\"). It is, moreover, evident from the \"Kitāb al-Kas̲h̲f wa ’l-bayān\" of the early Baghdadi Sufi mystic Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz (d. 899) that a cohesive understanding of the Muslim saints was already in existence, with al-Kharraz spending ample space distinguishing between the virtues and miracles (\"karāmāt\") of the prophets and the saints. The genre of hagiography (\"manāḳib\") only became more popular with the passage of time, with numerous prominent Islamic thinkers of the medieval period devoting large works to collecting stories of \"various\" saints or to focusing upon \"the marvelous aspects of the life, the miracles or at least the prodigies of a [specific] Ṣūfī or of a saint believed to have been endowed with miraculous powers.\"\n\nIn the late ninth-century, important thinkers in Sunni Islam officially articulated the previously-oral doctrine of an entire hierarchy of saints, with the first written account of this hierarchy coming from the pen of al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 907-912). With the general consensus of Islamic scholars of the period accepting that the ulema were responsible for maintaining the \"exoteric\" part of Islamic orthodoxy, including the disciplines of law and jurisprudence, while the Sufis were responsible for articulating the religion's deepest inward truths, later prominent mystics like Ibn Arabi (d. 1240) only further reinforced this idea of a saintly hierarchy, and the notion of \"types\" of saints became a mainstay of Sunni mystical thought, with such types including the \"ṣiddīqūn\" (\"the truthful ones\") and the \"abdāl\" (\"the substitute-saints\"), amongst others. It should be noted, however, that many of these concepts appear in writing far before al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi; the idea of the \"abdāl\", for example, appears as early as the \"Musnad\" of Ibn Hanbal (d. 855), where the word signifies a group of major saints \"whose number would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death.\" It is, in fact, reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified his contemporary, the mystic Maruf Karkhi (d. 815-20), as one of the \"abdal\", saying: \"He is one of the substitute-saints, and his supplication is answered.\"\nFrom the twelfth to the fourteenth century, \"the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods.\" In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be \"a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples.\" It was by virtue of his spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, \"and it is this which ... [effected] his 'canonization,' and not some ecclesiastical institution\" as in Christianity. In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of canonization. In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam that many of the most important creeds articulated during the time period, like the famous \"Creed of Tahawi\", explicitly declared it a requirement for being an \"orthodox\" Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of saints and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles. Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of venerating \"the tombs\" of saints, like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the Hanbali jurist stating: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers.\" In the words of one contemporary academic, practically all Muslims of that era believed that \"the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable.\"\n\nIn the modern world, the idea of saints has been challenged by the movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, whose influence has \"formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints.\" For the adherents of Wahhabism, for example, the practice of venerating saints appears as an \"abomination\", for they see in this a form of idolatry. It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which adheres to the Wahhabi creed, \"destroyed the tombs of saints wherever ... able\" during its expansion in the Arabian Peninsula from the eighteenth-century onwards. As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements have indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to also resist \"acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\" At the same time, the movement of Islamic Modernism has also opposed the traditional veneration of saints, for many proponents of this ideology regard the practice as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\" Despite the presence, however, of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital part in the daily piety of vast portions of Muslim countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.\n\nThe general definition of the Muslim saint in classical texts is that he represents a \"[friend of God] marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness\", being specifically \"chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" Moreover, the saint is also portrayed in traditional hagiographies as one who \"in some way ... acquires his Friend's, i.e. God's, good qualities, and therefore he possesses particular authority, forces, capacities and abilities.\" Amongst classical scholars, Qushayri (d. 1073) defined the saint as someone \"whose obedience attains permanence without interference of sin; whom God preserves and guards, in permanent fashion, from the failures of sin through the power of acts of obedience.\" Elsewhere, the same author quoted an older tradition in order to convey his understanding of the purpose of saints, which states: \"The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 869), the most significant ninth-century expositor of the doctrine, posited six common attributes of true saints (not necessarily applicable to all, according to the author, but nevertheless indicative of a significant portion of them), which are: (1) when people see him, they are automatically reminded of God; (2) anyone who advances towards him in a hostile way is destroyed; (3) he possesses the gift of clairvoyance (\"firāsa\"); (4) he receives divine inspiration (\"ilhām\"), to be strictly distinguished from revelation proper (\"waḥy\"), with the latter being something only the prophets receive; (5) he can work miracles (\"karāmāt\") by the leave of God, which may differ from saint to saint, but may include marvels such as walking on water (\"al-mas̲h̲y ʿalā ’l-māʾ\") and shortening space and time (\"ṭayy al-arḍ\"); and (6) he associates with Khidr. Al-Tirmidhi states, furthermore, that although the saint is not sinless like the prophets, he or she can nevertheless be \"preserved from sin\" (\"maḥfūz\") by the grace of God. The contemporary scholar of Sufism Martin Lings described the Islamic saints as \"the great incarnations of the Islamic ideal... spiritual giants with which almost every generation was blessed.\"\n\nThe doctrine of saints, and of their miracles, seems to have been taken for granted by many of the major authors of the Islamic Golden Age (ca. 700-1400), as well as by many prominent late-medieval scholars. The phenomena in traditional Islam can be at least partly ascribed to the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni theologians and doctors of the classical and medieval periods, many of whom considered the belief in saints to be \"orthodox\" doctrine. Examples of classical testimonies include:\n\n\nThe rationale for veneration of deceased saints by pilgrims in an appeal for blessings (\"Barakah\") even though the saints will not rise from the dead until the Day of Resurrection (\"Yawm ad-Dīn\") may come from the hadith that states “the Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray”. (According to the Islamic concept of Punishment of the Grave -- established by hadith -- the dead are still conscious and active, with the wicked suffering in their graves as a prelude to hell and the pious at ease.) According to Islamic historian Jonathan A.C. Brown, \"saints are thought to be no different\" than prophets, \"as able in death to answer invocations for assistance\" as they were while alive.\n\nSaints were envisaged to be of different \"types\" in classical Islamic tradition. Aside from their earthly differences as regard their temporal duty (i.e. jurist, hadith scholar, judge, traditionist, historian, ascetic, poet), saints were also distinguished cosmologically as regards their celestial function or standing. In Islam, however, the saints are represented in traditional texts as serving separate celestial functions, in a manner similar to the angels, and this is closely linked to the idea of a celestial hierarchy in which the various types of saints play different roles. A fundamental distinction was described in the ninth-century by al-Tirmidhi in his \"Sīrat al-awliyāʾ\" (\"Lives of the Saints\"), who distinguished between two principal varieties of saints: the \"walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh\", on the one hand, and the \"walī Allāh\" on the other. According to the author, \"the [spiritual] ascent of the \"walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh\" must stop at the end of the created cosmos ... he can attain God's proximity, but not God Himself; he is only admitted to God's proximity (\"muḳarrab\"). It is the \"walī Allāh\" who reaches God. Ascent beyond God's throne means to traverse consciously the realms of light of the Divine Names... When the \"walī Allāh\" has traversed all the realms of the Divine Names, i.e. has come to know God in His names as completely as possible, he is then extinguished in God's essence. His soul, his ego, is eliminated and ... when he acts, it is God Who acts through him. And so the state of extinction means at the same time the highest degree of activity in this world.\"\n\nAlthough the doctrine of the hierarchy of saints is already found in written sources as early as the eighth-century, it was al-Tirmidhi who gave it its first systematic articulation.\nAccording to the author, forty major saints, whom he refers to by the various names of \"ṣiddīḳīn\", \"abdāl\", \"umanāʾ\", and \"nuṣaḥāʾ\", were appointed after the death of Muhammad to perpetuate the knowledge of the divine mysteries vouchsafed to them by the prophet. These forty saints, al-Tirmidhi stated, would be replaced in each generation after their earthly death; and, according to him, \"the fact that they exist is a guarantee for the continuing existence of the world.\" Among these forty, al-Tirmidhi specified that seven of them were especially blessed. Despite their exalted nature, however, al-Tirmidhi emphasized that these forty saints occupied a rank below the prophets. Later important works which detailed the hierarchy of saints were composed by the mystic ʿAmmār al-Bidlīsī (d. between 1194 and 1207), the spiritual teacher of Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1220), and by Ruzbihan Baqli (d. 1209), who evidently knew of \"a highly developed hierarchy of God's friends.\" The differences in terminology between the various celestial hierarchies presented by these authors were reconciled by later scholars through their belief that the earlier mystics had highlighted particular parts and different aspects of a single, cohesive hierarchy of saints.\n\nThe amount of veneration a specific saint received varied from region to region in Islamic civilization, often on the basis of the saint's own history in that region. While the veneration of saints played a crucial role in the daily piety of Sunni Muslims all over the Islamic world for more than a thousand years (ca. 800-1800), exactly \"which\" saints were most widely venerated in any given cultural climate depended on the hagiographic traditions of that particular area. Thus, while Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236), for example, was honored throughout the Sunni world in the medieval period, his \"cultus\" was especially prominent in the Indian Subcontinent, as that is where he was believed to have preached, performed the majority of his miracles, and ultimately settled at the end of his life.\n\nAs has been remarked by scholars, the veneration of saints has played \"an essential role in the religious, and social life of the Maghreb for more or less a millennium,\" in other words since Islam first reached the lands of North Africa in the eighth-century. The first \"written\" references to ascetic Muslim saints in Africa, \"popularly admired and with followings,\" appear in tenth-century hagiographies. As has been noted by scholars, however, \"the phenomenon may well be older,\" for many of the stories of the Islamic saints were passed down orally before finally being put to writing. One of the most widely venerated saints in early North African Islamic history was Abū Yaʿzā (or Yaʿazzā, d. 1177), an illiterate Sunni Maliki miracle worker whose reputation for sanctity was admired even in his own life. Another immensely popular saint of the time-period was Ibn Ḥirzihim (d. 1163), who also gained renown for his personal devoutness and his ability to work miracles. It was Abu Madyan (d. 1197), however, who eventually became one of the \"Awliya Allah\" of the entire Maghreb. A \"spiritual disciple of these two preceding saints,\" Abū Madyan, a prominent Sunni Maliki scholar, was the first figure in Maghrebi Sufism \"to exercise an influence beyond his own region.\" Abū Madyan travelled to the East, where he is said to have met prominent mystics like the renowned Hanbali jurist Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166). Upon returning to the Maghreb, Abū Madyan stopped at Béjaïa and \"formed a circle of disciples.\" Abū Madyan eventually died in Tlemcen, while making his way to the Almohad court of Marrakesh; he was later venerated as a prime \"Awliya Allah\" of Tlemcen by popular acclaim.\n\nOne of Abū Madyan's most notable disciples was ʿAbd al-Salām Ibn Mas̲h̲īs̲h̲ (d. 1127), a \"saint ... [who] had a posthumous fame through his being recognised as a master and a 'pole' by\" Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī (d. 1258). It was this last figure who became \"the\" preeminent saint in Maghrebi piety, due to his being the founder of one of the most famous Sunni Sufi orders of North Africa: the Shadhiliyya tariqa. Adhering to the Maliki rite in its jurisprudence, the Shadhili order produced numerous widely honored Sunni saints in the intervening years, including Fāsī Aḥmad al-Zarrūq (d. 1494), who was educated in Egypt but taught in Libya and Morocco, and Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Jazūlī (d. 1465), \"who returned to Morocco after a long trip to the East and then began a life as a hermit,\" and who achieved widespread renown for the miracles he is said to have wrought by the leave of God. Eventually, the latter was buried in Marrakesh, where he ended up becoming of the city's seven most famous \"Awliya Allah\" for the Sunnis of the area. Some of the most popular and influential Maghrebi saints and mystics of the following centuries were Muḥammad b. Nāṣir (d. 1674), Aḥmad al-Tij̲ānī (d. 1815), Abū Ḥāmid al-ʿArabī al-Darqāwī (d. 1823), and Aḥmad b. ʿAlāwī (d. 1934), with the latter three originating Sufi orders of their own. Famous adherents of the Shadhili order amongst modern Islamic scholars include Abdallah Bin Bayyah (b. 1935), Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki (d. 2004), Hamza Yusuf (b. 1958), and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi (b. 1963).\n\nThe veneration of saints in Maghrebi Sunni Islam has been studied by scholars with regard to the various \"types\" of saints venerated by Sunnis in those areas. These include:\n\n\nRegarding the veneration of saints amongst Sunni Muslims in the Maghreb in the present day, scholars have noted the presence of many \"thousands of minor, local saints whose tombs remain visible in villages or the quarters of towns.\" Although many of these saints lack precise historiographies or hagiographies, \"their presence and their social efficacity ... [are] immense\" in shaping the spiritual life of Muslims in the region. For the vast majority of Muslims in the Maghreb even today, the saints remain \"very much alive at their tomb, to the point that the person's name most often serves to denote the place.\" While this classical type of Sunni veneration represents the most widespread stance in the area, the modern influence of Salafism and Wahhabism have challenged the traditional practice in some quarters.\n\nScholars have noted the tremendously \"important role\" the veneration of saints has historically played in Islamic life all these areas, especially amongst Sunnis who frequent the many thousands of tombs scattered throughout the region for blessings in performing the act of \"ziyāra\". According to scholars, \"between the Turks of the Balkans and Anatolia, and those in Central Asia, despite the distance separating them, the concept of the saint and the organisation of pilgrimages displays no fundamental differences.\" The veneration of saints really spread in the Turkish lands from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries, and played a crucial role in medieval Turkic Sunni piety not only in cosmopolitan cities but also \"in rural areas and amongst nomads of the whole Turkish world.\" One of the reasons proposed by scholars for the popularity of saints in pre-modern Turkey is that Islam was majorly spread by the early Sunni Sufis in the Turkish lands, rather than by purely exoteric teachers. Most of the saints venerated in Turkey belonged to the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence.\n\nAs scholars have noted, saints venerated in traditional Turkish Sunni Islam may be classified into three principal categories:\n\nReverence for Awliya Allah have been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: \"There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.\" As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, the \"Awliya Allah\" are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the \"Wali'Allah\" of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein. Here is a partial list of Muslim \"Awliya Allah\":\n\n\n\n\n"}

When made with Ale-8-One and Maker's Mark this drink is commonly referred to as a Kentucky Gentleman. A similar Canadian drink, the Rye & Ginger, is made with Canadian whisky and ginger ale.\n\nDating back to the 1890s, it was a non-alcoholic mixture of ginger ale, ice and lemon peel. By the 1910s, brandy, or bourbon would be added for a \"Horse's Neck with a Kick\" or a \"Stiff Horse's Neck\". The non-alcoholic version was still served in upstate New York in the late 1950s and early 60s, but eventually it was phased out.\n\nIn the 1934 film \"The Captain Hates the Sea\", Alison Skipworth's character craves a Horse's Neck, when Fred Keating's character tries to stop her, she says, \"...I'm a lone wolf and it's my night to howl\" then tells the waiter \"...be sure to add a big horse, Charley\".\n\nIn the 1935 musical film, \"Top Hat\", Madge (Helen Broderick) tries to order a drink in Italian but gives up and says \"Horses Neck\".\n\nIn the 1935 film \"No Limit\", starring George Formby as George Shuttleworth, George accidentally orders a Horse's Neck at the bar in the steam packet ferry en route to the Isle of Man.

{"id": "276752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276752", "title": "Wheat gluten (food)", "text": "Wheat gluten (food)\n\nWheat gluten is a food made from gluten, the main protein of wheat. It is made by washing wheat flour dough with water until all the starch granules have been removed, leaving the sticky insoluble gluten as an elastic mass which is then cooked before being eaten.\n\nWheat gluten is an alternative to soybean-based foods such as tofu, which are sometimes used as meat substitutes. Some types of wheat gluten have a chewy or stringy texture that resembles meat more than other substitutes. Wheat gluten is often used instead of meat in Asian, vegetarian, Buddhist, and macrobiotic cuisines. Mock duck is a common use for wheat gluten.\n\nWheat gluten proteins are deficient in lysine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\nWheat gluten first appeared during the 6th century as an ingredient for Chinese noodles. It has historically been popular in the cuisines of China, Japan and other East and Southeast Asian nations. In Asia, it is commonly found on the menus of restaurants catering primarily to Buddhist customers who do not eat meat.\n\nWheat gluten has been documented in China since the 6th century. It was widely consumed by the Chinese as a substitute for meat, especially among adherents of Buddhism. The oldest reference to wheat gluten appears in the \"Qimin Yaoshu\", a Chinese agricultural encyclopedia written by Jia Sixie in 535. The encyclopedia mentions noodles prepared from wheat gluten called \"bo duo\". Wheat gluten was known as \"mian jin\" by the Song dynasty (960–1279). Wheat gluten arrived in the West by the 18th century. \"De Frumento\", an Italian treatise on wheat written in Latin by Bartolomeo Beccari in 1728 and published in Bologna in 1745, describes the process of washing wheat flour dough in order to extract the gluten. John Imison wrote an English-language definition of wheat gluten in his \"Elements of Science and Art\" published in 1803. By the 1830s, Western doctors were recommending wheat gluten in diets for diabetics. In the United States, the Seventh-day Adventists promoted the consumption of wheat gluten beginning in the late 19th century. Sanitarium Foods, a company affiliated with John Harvey Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, advertised wheat gluten in 1882.\n\nThe word seitan is of Japanese origin and was coined in 1961 by George Ohsawa, a Japanese advocate of the macrobiotic diet, to refer to a wheat gluten product created by Ohsawa's student Kiyoshi Mokutani. In 1962, wheat gluten was sold as seitan in Japan by Marushima Shoyu K.K. It was imported to the West in 1969 by the American company Erewhon.\n\nWheat gluten is also called seitan (, ; Japanese: セイタン), mianjin (Chinese: 麵筋), milgogi(Korean: 밀고기), wheat meat, gluten meat, or simply gluten.\n\nWheat gluten, called \"miàn jīn\" in Chinese (traditional: , simplified: , literally \"dough tendon\"; also spelled \"mien chin\" or \"mien ching\") is believed to have originated in ancient China, as a meat substitute for adherents of Buddhism, particularly some Mahayana Buddhist monks, who are strict vegetarians (see Buddhist cuisine). One story attributes the invention of imitation meat to chefs who made it for Chinese emperors who, traditionally, observed a week of vegetarianism each year. \"Miàn jīn\" is often deep fried before being cooked in Chinese cuisine, which confers a crispy rind that enhances the texture of the gluten. There are three primary Chinese forms of wheat gluten.\n\nOil-fried gluten (, \"yóu miàn jīn\") is raw gluten that has been torn into small bits, then deep-fried into small puffy balls of around 3–5 cm in diameter and sold as \"imitation abalone\". They are golden brown in color, and braised or boiled in a savory soup or stew before eating. They are frequently paired with \"xiang gu\" (black mushrooms). Larger fried balls of gluten, called \"miàn jīn qiú\" () or \"miàn jīn pao\" (面筋泡), which may be up to in diameter, are sometimes seen in Asian supermarkets. These are often stuffed with meat or tofu mixtures and served as a dish called \"gluten meatballs\" (, \"Miàn jīn roù wán\") or \"gluten stuffed with meat\" (, \"miàn jīn saī roù\").\n\nSteamed gluten (, \"zhēng miàn jīn\"), is raw gluten that has been wrapped around itself to form a long sausage shape which is then steamed. This type of gluten has a dense texture and ranges from off-white to light greenish grey in color. It is torn open into strips before being used as an ingredient in recipes. When this sausage-shaped gluten is thickly sliced into medallions, the resulting form is called \"miàn lún\" (麵輪, literally \"gluten wheels\"). Larger blocks of steamed gluten are sometimes colored pink and sold as vegetarian \"mock ham.\"\n\n\nBaked spongy gluten (traditional ; simplified ; pinyin: \"kǎo fū\") is similar in texture to a sponge, \"kao fu\" (sometimes labeled in English as \"bran puff\") is made by leavening raw gluten, then baking or steaming it. These are sold as small blocks in Chinese markets and are then diced up and cooked. This type of gluten absorbs its cooking liquid like a sponge and is enjoyed for its \"juicy\" character. Chinese \"kao fu\" has a different texture from its Japanese counterpart, \"yaki-fu\", due to the relatively larger air bubbles it contains. \"Kao fu\" is available in fresh, frozen, dehydrated, and canned forms.\n\n\"Miàn jīn\" is also available in Asian grocery stores in canned and jarred forms, often marinated in combination with peanuts or mushrooms. Such canned and jarred gluten is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to congee (boiled rice porridge) as part of a traditional Chinese breakfast.\n\nFreshly prepared \"miàn jīn\" can be difficult to find in Chinese restaurants other than those specializing in Buddhist or vegetarian cuisine. Depending on its method of preparation and ingredients used, both fresh and preserved \"miàn jīn\" can be used to simulate pork, poultry, beef, or even seafood.\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, the traditional type of wheat gluten is called \"fu\" ((), lit. \"gluten\"), originated from Jiangnan dialect for \"\". In Japan, the two main types of \"fu\" are most widely used in Buddhist vegetarian cooking (\"Shojin ryori\") and tea ceremony cuisine (\"cha-kaiseki 茶懐石\")(). There are two main forms of \"fu\", the raw \"nama-fu\", and dry-baked \"yaki-fu\".\n\nRaw (\"nama-fu\" ) is solid gluten which is mixed with glutinous rice flour and millet and steamed in large blocks. It may be shaped and colored in a variety of ways, using ingredients such as mugwort. Popular shapes include autumn-colored maple leaves and bunnies. Such shapes and colors enhance the attractiveness of the cooked product since steamed gluten has an unappealing grey tone. \"Nama-fu\" is an important ingredient in Shōjin-ryōri, the Buddhist vegetarian cuisine of Japan. It may also be used as an ingredient in wagashi, Japanese confectionery. Fu-manjū () is a type of manjū made from \"nama-fu\". Solid gluten is sweetened and filled with various sweet fillings such as red bean paste. They are then wrapped in leaves and steamed in a manner similar to that used to prepare Chinese zongzi.\n\nDry baked (\"yaki-fu\" or \"sukiyaki-fu\" ) is gluten leavened with baking powder and baked into long bread-like sticks. It is often sold in cut form, as hard dry discs resembling croutons or bread rusk. Yaki-fu is typically added to miso soup and sukiyaki, where it absorbs some of the broth and acquires a fine texture that is lighter and fluffier than its Chinese equivalent. It is the most commonly available type of \"fu\" in Japanese supermarkets.\n\nIn Japan, seitan, initially a rather salty macrobiotic seasoning that gradually evolved into a food, is not well known or widely available, despite the macrobiotic diet's Japanese origins. When used, the terms for this food are rendered in katakana as (Romanized \"gurutenmīto,\" from the English \"gluten meat\"), or, rarely, (\"seitan\"). Outside macrobiotic circles, these terms are virtually unknown in Japan, and they do not typically appear in Japanese dictionaries.\n\nIn Vietnam, wheat gluten is called \"mì căng\" or \"mì căn\", and is prepared in a similar fashion to Chinese \"miàn jīn\". Along with tofu, it is a part of the Buddhist cuisine of Vietnam.\n\n\"Seitan\", a neologism of Japanese origin, is a food made from wheat gluten in the macrobiotic system of cooking and health, as formulated by the Japanese-born philosopher George Ohsawa (1893–1966). According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", it is said to have been coined by Ohsawa in the early 1960s, but its etymology is uncertain. The first syllable may be from 生 (sei, \"be, become\"), 正 (sei, \"proper, correct\"), or 製 (sei, \"made of\"), while the second syllable is from 蛋 (tan, from 蛋白 (tanpaku, \"protein\")).\n\nThe meaning of the word \"seitan\" has undergone a gradual evolution. The initial product, imported from Japan in 1969 was a very salty seasoning, the color of soy sauce, sold in a small glass jar or plastic pouch, to be used as a seasoning for brown rice. The name gradually came to refer to any wheat gluten seasoned with soy sauce. The people most responsible for this change are Nik and Joanne Amartseff, who invented Tan Pups in 1972 and John Weissman, who in 1974 invented Wheatmeat (first meatballs then cutlets made of seitan) in Boston. All worked for years to popularize these pioneering products at the Erewhon retail store, and developed a trademark on the Wheatmeat name.\n\nWhile wheat gluten itself is rather flavorless, it holds a marinade very well and is usually simmered in a \"dashi\" (broth) made from soy sauce, kombu, ginger, and sometimes also sesame oil.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, wheat gluten (usually called seitan) has been increasingly adopted by vegetarians in Western nations as a meat alternative. It is sold in block, strip and shaped forms in North America, where it can be found in some supermarkets, Asian food markets, health food stores and cooperatives.\n\nThe block form of seitan is often flavored with shiitake or portobello mushrooms, fresh coriander or onion, or barbecue sauce, or packed in a vegetable-based broth. In strip form, it can be packed to be eaten right out of the package as a high-protein snack. Shaped seitan products, in the form of \"ribs\" and patties, are frequently flavored with barbecue, teriyaki, or other savory sauces.\n\nWheat gluten is also used in many vegetarian products in various countries, for example by The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, a vegan African American religious sect that operates a chain of restaurants, to produce vegetarian sandwiches. In North America, there are several brand-name meat alternatives, which are used in the restaurant and food service markets.\n\nA powdered form of wheat gluten is produced and sold as an additive for baking or used to make seitan. Vital wheat gluten is nearly all gluten and almost no starch. When used as an additive in baking, its purpose is to add elasticity to flours that would otherwise be low in gluten, such as whole wheat flour or rye. It improves the rise of the raw dough and also improves the texture and chewiness of the final product. Very little is required, generally about 1 Tablespoon (15ml) per 2-3 cups (480-620 ml) of flour.\n\nThe powdered form of wheat gluten (vital wheat gluten), is made by hydrating hard wheat flour to activate the gluten and then processing the hydrated mass to remove the starch, leaving only the gluten. The gluten is then dried and ground back into a powder.\n\nSeitan may be made from vital wheat gluten or from hard wheat flour (a.k.a. high-protein flour, high-gluten flour, or gluten flour). When seitan is made from vital wheat gluten, the powder is simply rehydrated to form the gluten and then cooked. Seitan produced from wheat flour is a longer process. First a dough is made by hydrating the flour, then the dough is kneaded under running water to remove the starch from the dough, leaving only the gluten. The gluten is then cut into pieces and cooked via steaming, boiling, frying, or other methods.\n\nWheat gluten is used both as a protein source and binding ingredient in pet foods. Wheat gluten from China adulterated by melamine was blamed as the cause of the 2007 pet food recalls.\n\n\n"}

Thus a \"Thai\" may be any resident or citizen of Thailand of any ethnic group, or more narrowly a member of the Thai people.\n\nConversely, some groups of people may be associated with multiple demonyms. For example, a native of the United Kingdom may be called a \"British person\", a \"Briton\" or, informally, a \"Brit\". In some languages, a demonym may be borrowed from another language as a nickname or descriptive adjective for a group of people: for example, \"Québécois(e)\" is commonly used in English for a native of Quebec (though \"Quebecker\" is also available).\n\nIn English, demonyms are capitalized and are often the same as the adjectival form of the place, e.g. \"Egyptian\", \"Japanese\", or \"Greek\". Significant exceptions exist; for instance, the adjectival form of Spain is \"Spanish\", but the demonym is \"Spaniard\".\n\nEnglish commonly uses national demonyms such as \"Ethiopian\" or \"Guatemalan\", while the usage of local demonyms such as \"Chicagoan\", \"Okie\", or \"Parisian\", is rare. Many local demonyms are rarely used and many places, especially smaller towns and cities, lack a commonly used and accepted demonym altogether.\nThe word \"gentilic\" comes from the Latin \"gentilis\" (\"of a clan, or gens\") and the English suffix \"-ic\". The word \"demonym\" was derived from the Greek word meaning \"populace\" (, \"demos\") with the suffix for \"name\" (-onym).\n\n\"National Geographic\" attributes the term \"demonym\" to Merriam-Webster editor Paul Dickson in a recent work from 1990. The word did not appear for nouns, adjectives, and verbs derived from geographical names in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary nor in prominent style manuals such as the \"Chicago Manual of Style\". It was subsequently popularized in this sense in 1997 by Dickson in his book \"Labels for Locals\". However, in \"What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names\" (the first edition of \"Labels for Locals\") Dickson attributed the term to George H. Scheetz, in his \"Names' Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon\" (1988), which is apparently where the term first appears. The term may have been fashioned after \"demonymic\", which the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines as the name of an Athenian citizen according to the deme to which the citizen belongs, with its first use traced to 1893.\n\nSeveral linguistic elements are used to create demonyms in the English language. The most common is to add a suffix to the end of the location name, slightly modified in some instances. These may resemble Late Latin, Semitic, Celtic, or Germanic suffixes, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\nas adaptations from the standard Spanish suffix \"-e(ñ/n)o\" (sometimes using a final \"-a\" instead of \"-o\" for a female, following the Spanish suffix standard \"-e(ñ/n)a\")\n\n\n\nOften used for European locations and Canadian locations\n\n\"-ish\" is usually proper only as an adjective. See note below list.\n\nOften used for Middle Eastern locations and European locations.\n\n\n\n\"-ese\" is usually considered proper only as an adjective, or to refer to the entirety. Thus, \"a Chinese person\" is used rather than \"a Chinese\". Often used for East Asian and Francophone locations, from the similar-sounding French suffix \"-ais(e)\", which is originally from the Latin adjectival ending \"-ensis\", designating origin from a place: thus Hispaniensis (Spanish), Danensis (Danish), etc.\n\nMostly for Middle Eastern and South Asian locales and in Latinate names for the various people that ancient Romans encountered (e.g. Allemanni, Helvetii)\n\n\n\nUsed especially for Greek locations.\n\n\nOften used for French locations.\n\n\nOften used for British and Irish locations.\n\n\n\nWhile derived from French, these are also official demonyms in English.\n\n\nIt is much rarer to find Demonyms created with a prefix. Mostly they are from Africa and the Pacific, and are not generally known or used outside the country concerned. In much of East Africa, a person of a particular ethnic group will be denoted by a prefix. For example, a person of the Luba people would be a Muluba, the plural form Baluba, and the language, Kiluba or Tshiluba. Similar patterns with minor variations in the prefixes exist throughout on a tribal level. And Fijians who are indigenous Fijians are known as Kaiviti (Viti being the Fijian name for Fiji). On a country level:\n\nIn the Pacific, at least two countries use prefixation:\n\n\nDemonyms may also not conform to the underlying naming of a particular place, but instead arise out of historical or cultural particularities that become associated with its denizens. These demonyms are usually more informal and colloquial. In the United States such informal demonyms frequently become associated with mascots of the intercollegiate sports teams of the state university system. In other countries the origins are often disputed.\n\n\n\n\nLiterature and science fiction have created a wealth of gentilics that are not directly associated with a cultural group. These will typically be formed using the standard models above. Examples include Martian for hypothetical people of Mars (credited to scientist Percival Lowell) or \"Gondorian\" for the people of Tolkien's fictional land of Gondor or \"Atlantean\" for Plato's island \"Atlantis\".\n\nOther science fiction examples include Jovian for those of Jupiter or its moons, and Venusian for those of Venus. Fictional aliens refer to the inhabitants of Earth as Earthling (from the diminutive \"-ling\", ultimately from Old English \"-ing\" meaning \"descendant\"), as well as \"Terran\", \"Terrene\", \"Tellurian\", \"Earther\", \"Earthican\", \"Terrestrial\", and \"Solarian\" (from Sol, the sun).\n\nFantasy literature which involves other worlds or other lands also has a rich supply of gentilics. Examples include \"Lilliputians\" and \"Brobdingnagians\", from the islands of Lilliput and Brobdingnag in the satire \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nIn a few cases, where a linguistic background has been created, non-standard gentilics are formed (or the eponyms back-formed). Examples include Tolkien's \"Rohirrim\" (from Rohan) and the \"Star Trek\" world's \"Klingon\" people (with various version of homeworld name).\n\n-onym, especially ethnonym and Exonym and endonym\n\n"}

It usually takes the form of a pool of bubbling mud. The acid and microorganisms decompose surrounding rock into clay and mud.\n\nThe mud of a mudpot takes the form of a viscous, often bubbling, slurry. As the boiling mud is often squirted over the brims of the mudpot, a sort of mini-volcano of mud starts to build up, sometimes reaching heights of 1 to 1.5 meters. Although mudpots are often called \"mud volcanoes\", true mud volcanoes are very different in nature. The mud of a mudpot is generally of white to greyish color, but is sometimes stained with reddish or pink spots from iron compounds. When the slurry is particularly colorful, the feature may be referred to as a paint pot.\n\nMudpots form in high-temperature geothermal areas where water is in short supply. The little water that is available rises to the surface at a spot where the soil is rich in volcanic ash, clay, and other fine particulates. The thickness of the mud usually changes along with seasonal changes in the water table.\n\nThe geothermal areas of Yellowstone National Park contain several notable examples of both mudpots and paint pots, as do some areas of Azerbaijan, Iceland and New Zealand. Several locations in and around the Salton Sea in California are also home to active mudpots. Bumpass Hell in Lassen Volcanic National Park also contains mudpots.\n\n"}

A traditional side dish to roast beef is Yorkshire pudding.\n\nRoast beef is a signature national dish of England and holds cultural meaning for the English dating back to the 1731 ballad \"The Roast Beef of Old England\". The dish is so synonymous with England and its cooking methods from the 18th century that the French nickname for the English is \"les Rosbifs\".\n\nThe beef on weck sandwich is a tradition in western New York dating back to the early 1800s.

Traditionally a speciality of Devon and Cornwall, cream teas are offered for sale in tea rooms in those two counties, as well as in other parts of England, and elsewhere in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe exact origin of \"cream tea\" is disputed, although there is evidence to suggest that the tradition of eating bread with cream and jam already existed at Tavistock Abbey in Devon in the 11th century. \nThe earliest use of \"cream tea\" in the sense of this article (as opposed to a cup of tea with cream in it) that the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" reports is in the 1964 novel \"Picture of Millie\" by Philip Maitland Hubbard, \"We just bathe and moon about and eat cream teas.\" However, the \"Foods of England\" website has discovered a newspaper cutting, 'The Cornishman' of Thursday, 3 September 1931 (p. 8), which uses the phrase in its modern sense.\n\nThere are regional variations as to how a cream tea should preferably be eaten. \n\nAlthough these distinctions on whether to apply the jam or the clotted cream to the scone first are still claimed by many, cream teas are served and enjoyed both cream first and jam first throughout both counties.\n\nScones are rarely buttered in commercially available teas. Traditionally it is important that the scones be warm (ideally, freshly baked), and that clotted (rather than whipped) cream and strawberry jam, rather than any other variety, are used. Butter is generally not included, and some sources advise that the tea should not be served with milk.\n\nIn Devon, an alternative to the scone found occasionally is the \"Devon split\" or \"Chudleigh\", lighter than a scone and smaller than a Cornish split. In Cornwall an alternative was traditionally a \"Cornish split\", a type of slightly sweet white bread roll, rather than a scone. It is now rare to find this available commercially, even in Cornwall, but splits are still used by many Cornish families in their own homes. \n\nAnother variation to a cream tea is called \"Thunder and Lightning\", which consists of a round of bread, topped with clotted cream and honey.\n\nIn May 2010, a campaign was launched at the Devon County Show to have the name \"Devon cream tea\" protected within the European Union under Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) rules.

{"id": "279562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279562", "title": "Scone", "text": "Scone\n\nA scone is a British baked good, usually made of wheat, or oatmeal with baking powder as a leavening agent and baked on sheet pans. A scone is often lightly sweetened and occasionally glazed with egg wash. The scone is a basic component of the cream tea or Devonshire tea. It differs from teacakes and other types of sweets that are made with yeast.\n\nThe pronunciation of the word within the English-speaking world varies. According to one academic study, two-thirds of the British population pronounce it (rhymes with gone) with the preference rising to 99% in the Scottish population. According to another survey, 51% of the British people pronounce it , while 41% pronounce it (rhymes with tone). The difference in pronunciation is largely regional in Britain, with those who rhyme it with \"gone\" predominating in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England, and those who rhyme it with \"cone\" dominating in southern England and the Midlands. The pronunciation is also favoured among Australians and Canadians. Natives of the Republic of Ireland and the United States mainly use the pronunciation. British dictionaries usually show the /ˈskɒn/ form as the preferred pronunciation, while recognising the /ˈskoʊn/ form.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionaries explain that there are also regional and class differences in England connected with the different pronunciations:\n\nThere are two possible pronunciations of the word scone: the first rhymes with gone and the second rhymes with tone. In US English, the pronunciation rhyming with tone is more common. In British English, the two pronunciations traditionally have different regional and class associations, with the first pronunciation associated with the north of England, while the second is associated with the south.\n\nThe difference in pronunciation is alluded to in a delightful little rhyme:\n\n<poem>\nI asked the maid in dulcet tone\nTo order me a buttered scone;\nThe silly girl has been and gone\nAnd ordered me a buttered scone.\n</poem>\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" reports that the first mention of the word was in 1513. Origin of the word \"scone\" is obscure and may, in fact, derive from different sources. That is, the classic Scottish \"scone\" and the Dutch \"schoonbrood\" or \"spoonbread\" (very similar to the drop scone); and possibly other, similar and similarly named quick breads, may have made their way onto the British tea table, where their similar names merged into one.\n\nThus, \"scone\" may derive from the Middle Dutch \"schoonbrood\" (fine white bread), from \"schoon\" (pure, clean) and \"brood\" (bread), or it may derive from the Scots Gaelic term \"sgonn\" meaning a shapeless mass or large mouthful. The Middle Low German term \"schöne\" meaning fine bread may also have played a role in the origination of this word. And if the explanation put forward by Sheila MacNiven Cameron be true, the word may also be based on the town of Scone () (, ) in Scotland, the ancient capital of that country – where Scottish monarchs were still crowned, even after the capital was moved to Perth, then to Edinburgh (and on whose Stone of Scone the monarchs of the United Kingdom are still crowned today).\n\nThe original scone was round and flat, usually as large as a medium-sized plate. It was made and baked on a griddle (or \"girdle\", in Scots), then cut into triangular sections for serving. Today, many would call the large round cake a bannock, and call the triangles \"scones\". In Scotland, the words are often used interchangeably.\n\nWhen baking powder became available to the masses, scones began to be the oven-baked, well-leavened items we know today.\nModern scones are widely available in British bakeries, grocery stores, and supermarkets. A 2005 market report estimated the UK scone market to be worth £64m, showing a 9% increase over the previous five years. The increase is partly due to an increasing consumer preference for impulse and convenience foods.\n\nScones sold commercially are usually round, although some brands are hexagonal as this shape may be tessellated for space efficiency. When prepared at home, they may take various shapes including triangles, rounds and squares. Baking scones at home is often closely tied to heritage baking. They tend to be made using family recipes rather than recipe books, since it is often a family member who holds the \"best\" and most-treasured recipe.\n\nBritish scones are often lightly sweetened, but may also be savoury. They frequently include raisins, currants, cheese or dates. In Scotland and Ulster, savoury varieties of scone include \"soda scones\", also known as soda farls, and potato scones, normally known as \"tattie scones\", which resemble small, thin savoury pancakes made with potato flour. Potato scones are most commonly served fried in a full Scottish breakfast or an Ulster fry.\n\nThe griddle scone (or \"girdle scone\" in Scots) is a variety of scone which is cooked on a griddle (or girdle) on the stove top rather than baked in the oven. This usage is also common in New Zealand where scones of all varieties form an important part of traditional colonial New Zealand cuisine.\n\nOther common varieties include the \"dropped scone\", or \"drop scone\", like a pancake, after the method of dropping the batter onto the griddle or frying pan to cook it, and the \"lemonade scone\", which is made with lemonade and cream instead of butter and milk. There is also the fruit scone or fruited scone, which contains currants, sultanas, peel and glacé cherries, which is just like a plain round scone with the fruit mixed into the dough. To achieve lightness and flakiness, scones may be made with cream instead of milk.\n\nIn some countries one may also encounter savoury varieties of scone which may contain or be topped with combinations of cheese, onion, bacon, etc.\n\nScones can be presented with various toppings and condiments, typically butter, jam and cream. Strawberries are also sometimes used.\n\nScones were chosen as the Republic of Ireland representative for Café Europe during the Austrian Presidency of the European Union in 2006, while the United Kingdom chose shortbread.\n\nIn Hungary, a pastry very similar to the British version exists under the name \"pogácsa\". The name has been adopted by several neighbouring nations' languages. (E.g. Pogatsche in German.) Pogácsa is almost always savoury and served with varied seasonings and toppings, like dill and cheese.\n\nPumpkin scones, made by adding mashed cooked pumpkin to the dough mixture, had increased exposure during the period when Florence Bjelke-Petersen was in the public eye. Date scones, which contain chopped dried dates, can also be found in Australia. Another old style of cooking scones, generally in the colder months, is to deep-fry or deep pan-fry them in dripping or oil, when they are called \"puftaloons\".\n\nCheese scones are a popular snack sold in cafes or tea shops, where they are commonly served toasted with butter.\nThey are featured in the Edmonds Cookery Book and make up a part of kiwiana.\n\nRound British scones can resemble North American biscuits in appearance, but scones traditionally rely on cold butter, while biscuits are more often made with other kinds of animal fat or vegetable shortening. Also, while scones are frequently (but not always) sweet, and served with coffee and tea, biscuits are served more like a bread roll, often with breakfast in the American South.\n\nIn recent years, scones under that name have begun to appear in . They may be sweet, often containing fruit such as blueberries or sultanas, or else such flavorings as cinnamon or chocolate chips. US \"scones\" are usually actually closer to British Rock cakes. They are heavy, dry and crumbly, usually in a triangular or irregular shape.\n\nIn Utah and southern Idaho, the bread products locally called \"scones\" are similar to Native American frybread or New Orleans beignets and are made from a sweet yeast dough, with buttermilk and baking powder or soda added, and they are fried rather than baked. They are customarily served with butter and either honey or maple syrup.\n\nScones are quite popular in Argentina as well as Uruguay. They were brought there by Irish, English and Scottish immigrants and by Welsh immigrants in Patagonia (Britons are the third largest foreign community in Argentina). They are usually accompanied by tea, coffee or mate.\n\nUS-style scones were introduced a decade or so ago in Japan by American coffeehouses such as Starbucks. They are now widely available, not only in coffee shops but in various bakeries. As in the US, these \"scones\" are similar to Rock cakes and are heavy, dry, crumbly cakes in a triangular or irregular shape, often with fruit such as blueberries or chocolate chips. However raisins or sultanas are very uncommon.\n\nA few restaurants and tea shops specializing in British cuisine do sell authentic British scones, often as part of a Cream tea. For example, the \"Afternoon Tea\" tea shop chain offers this.\n\nIn Scots the verb \"scon\" means to crush flat or beat with the open hand on a flat surface, and \"scon-cap\" or \"scone-cap\" refers to a man's broad flat cap or \"bunnet\".\n\nIn Australia, scone can be a slang term for the head, usually referring to the crown region.\n\n"}
{"id": "279576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279576", "title": "Clotted cream", "text": "Clotted cream\n\nClotted cream (, sometimes called scalded, clouted, Devonshire or Cornish cream) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full-cream cow's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms \"clots\" or \"clouts\". It forms an essential part of a cream tea.\n\nAlthough its origin is uncertain, the cream's production is commonly associated with dairy farms in southwest England and in particular the counties of Cornwall and Devon. The current largest commercial producer in the United Kingdom is Rodda's at Scorrier, Redruth, Cornwall, which can produce up to 25 tons of clotted cream a day. In 1998 the term \"Cornish clotted cream\" became a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) by European Union directive, as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55%.\n\nClotted cream has been described as having a \"nutty, cooked milk\" flavour, and a \"rich sweet flavour\" with a texture that is grainy, sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface. It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum of 55 percent, but an average of 64 percent). For comparison, the fat content of single cream is only 18 percent.\n\nAccording to the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency, a tub of clotted cream provides , roughly equivalent to a cheeseburger.\n\nOriginally made by farmers to reduce the amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream has become so deep-rooted in the culture of southwest Britain that it is embedded as part of the region's tourist attraction. While there is no doubt of its strong and long association with Cornwall and Devon, it is not clear of its actual antiquity, or more recent development.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to Food\" follows traditional folklore by suggesting it may have been introduced to Cornwall by Phoenician traders in search of tin. It is similar to kaymak (or kajmak), a Near Eastern delicacy that is made throughout the Middle East, southeast Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, India, and Turkey. A similar clotted cream known as 'urum'(өрөм) is also made in Mongolia.\n\nContemporary ancient food experts, noting Strabo's commentaries on Britain have proposed that the early Britons would probably have clotted cream to preserve its freshness.\n\nMore recently, regional archaeologists have associated the stone \"fogou\" (dial. 'fuggy-hole'), or souterrains, found across Atlantic Britain, France, and Ireland as a possible form of \"cold store\" for dairy production of milk, cream, and cheese in particular. Similar functions are ascribed to the linhay (or 'linney') stone-built form, often used as a dairy in later medieval longhouses in the same regions.\n\nIt has long been disputed whether clotted cream originated in Devon or Cornwall, and which county makes it the best. There is evidence that the monks of Tavistock Abbey were making clotted cream in the early 14th century. After their abbey had been ransacked by Vikings in 997 AD, the monks rebuilt it with the help of Ordulf, Earl of Devon. Local workers were drafted in to help with the repairs, and the monks rewarded them with bread, clotted cream, and strawberry preserves. The 1658 cookery book \"The Compleat Cook\" had a recipe for \"clouted cream\".\n\nIn the 19th century it was regarded as better nourishment than \"raw\" cream because that cream was liable to go sour and be difficult to digest, causing illness. An article from 1853 calculates that creating clotted cream will produce 25 percent more cream than regular methods. In Devon, it was so common that in the mid-19th century it was used in the formative processes of butter, instead of churning cream or milk. The butter made in this way had a longer lifespan and was free from any negative flavours added by the churning.\n\nIt has long been the practice for local residents in southwest England, or those on holiday, to send small tins or tubs of clotted cream by post to friends and relations in other parts of the British Isles.\n\nIn 1993, an application was made for the name \"Cornish clotted cream\" to have a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) in the European Union for cream produced by the traditional recipe in Cornwall. This was accepted in 1998. Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall and have a minimum butterfat content of 55 percent. The unique, slightly yellow, Cornish clotted cream colour is due to the high carotene levels in the grass.\n\nTraditionally, clotted cream was created by straining fresh cow's milk, letting it stand in a shallow pan in a cool place for several hours to allow the cream to rise to the surface, then heating it either over hot cinders or in a water bath, before a slow cooling. The clots that formed on the top were then skimmed off with a long-handled cream-skimmer, known in Devon as a \"reamer\" or \"raimer\". By the mid-1930s, the traditional way of using milk brought straight from the dairy was becoming a rarity in Devon because using a cream separator actively separated the cream from the milk using centrifugal force, which produced far more clotted cream than the traditional method from the same amount of milk. As a farmer's wife in Poundsgate said, \"the separator saves a whole cow!\"\n\nToday, there are two distinct modern methods for making clotted cream. The \"float cream method\" includes scalding a floating layer of double cream in milk (skimmed or whole) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled for 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged. The \"scald cream method\" is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged. In the United Kingdom the resultant cream is deemed to be equivalent to pasteurised for legal purposes. Unlike pasteurisation, however, there is no requirement for the temperatures to be recorded on thermograph charts. As the temperatures are lower than used in standard pasteurisation, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.\n\nThe largest manufacturer in the United Kingdom is Rodda's, a family-owned business based in Scorrier, Cornwall. Founded in 1890, the company was producing over per year in 1985, and in 2010 the managing director said that they might produce as little as a day in January, but up to a day as Christmas approached. In the early 1980s, Rodda's signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in-flight desserts. The company considers the annual Wimbledon tennis championships one of their peak selling periods. As a by-product, for every of milk used, of skimmed milk is produced, which is then used in food manufacture.\n\nOne Devon manufacturer, Definitely Devon was purchased by Robert Wiseman Dairies in March 2006, closing one of the two Devon dairies and moving all production to Okehampton. However, in 2011 Robert Wiseman sold the Definitely Devon Brand to Rodda's, who moved the production of Definitely Devon to Cornwall, which caused some controversy as the name was not changed, prompting an investigation by Trading Standards.\n\nThroughout southwest England, clotted cream manufacture is a cottage industry, with many farms and dairies producing cream for sale in local outlets. Clotted cream is also produced in Somerset, Dorset, Herefordshire, Pembrokeshire, and the Isle of Wight.\n\nWhen authentic clotted cream is not available, there are ways to create a substitute product, such as by mixing mascarpone with whipped cream, a little sugar, and vanilla extract.\n\nClotted cream is an essential part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional \"splits\"—with strawberry jam, along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for \"Devon cream tea\" to have protected designation of origin similar to \"Cornish clotted cream\". One variation on a cream tea is called \"Thunder and Lightning\" which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup, honey, or treacle.\n\nClotted cream can be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, especially clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.\n\nClotted cream is used in some savoury dishes, and can be incorporated into mashed potato, risotto or scrambled eggs.\n\nCabbage cream (which does not contain cabbage) was a delicacy in the mid-17th century: layers of clotted cream were interspersed with sugar and rosewater, creating a cabbage effect when served. It was a common accompaniment to junket, a milk-based dessert which went out of fashion in the mid-20th century.\n\nClotted cream was mentioned in \"The Shepheardes Calendar\", a poem by Edmund Spenser in 1579:\n\n<poem>Ne would she scorn the simple shepherd swain,\nFor she would call him often heam,\nAnd give him curds and clouted cream.</poem>\n\nAs with many Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He eventually fell in love with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.\n\nClotted cream is also mentioned as one of the staple foods of the hobbits in J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" books.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "281802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=281802", "title": "Bhang", "text": "Bhang\n\nBhang () is an edible preparation of cannabis originating from the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE in ancient India. Bhang is traditionally distributed during the spring festival of Holi. Bhang is mainly used in Bhang shops, which sell the cannabis-infused Indian drinks bhang lassi and bhang thandai.\n\nGarcia de Orta, a Portuguese Jewish physician based in Goa, wrote extensively on \"bangue\" in his \"Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India\" (1563), including its recreational use by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and by many Portuguese. He explicitly rejects the notion that the Indian plant which produces \"bangue\" is the same as the European hemp plant (\"alcanave\").\n\nIn 1596, Dutchman Jan Huyghen van Linschoten wrote three pages on \"Bangue\" in a work documenting his journeys in the East, also mentioning the Egyptian Hashish, Turkish Boza, Turkish Bernavi, and Arabic Bursj forms of consumption. The historian Richard Davenport-Hines lists Thomas Bowrey as the first Westerner to document the use of bhang.\n\nUsing mortar and pestle, the buds and leaves of cannabis are ground into a paste which can be added to foods. For a beverage it is mixed with milk and filtered, then often flavored with kusha grass, sugar, fruit, and various spices. During festivals it is most used by krishna devotees in mathura it can be found in bhang \"thandai\" and bhang lassi. Bhang is also mixed with ghee and sugar to make a purple halva, and into peppery, chewy little balls called \"goli\" (which means \"tablet\" as well as \"pill\" in Hindi). Another form is \"bhanga chutney\", a Pahari cuisine from Uttarakhand.\n\nBhang is part of the ancient Hindu tradition and custom in the Indian subcontinent. In some parts of rural India, people attribute various medicinal properties to the cannabis plant. If taken in proper quantity, bhang is believed to cure fever, dysentery, sunstroke, to clear phlegm, aid in digestion, appetite, cure speech imperfections and lisping, and give alertness to the body.\n\nBhang lassi is a preparation of powdered green inflorescence with curd and whey put in a village blender (a hand blending operation is carried out till the butter rises). It is regarded as tasty and refreshing. It is legal in many parts of India and mainly sold during Holi, when pakoras containing bhang are also sometimes eaten. Uttar Pradesh has licensed bhang shops, and in many places in India one can buy bhang products and drink bhang lassis.\n\nThe tradition of consuming bhang lassi during Holi is particularly common in North India where Holi itself is celebrated with a fervor unseen elsewhere. Bhang is heavily consumed in Mathura, an ancient town of religious importance to the Hindus. Here the practice is believed to have been introduced by the followers of Krishna and has stayed ever since. They begin the preparation by Sanskrit chants and recitation of prayers. In Mathura, some people take bhang to work up their appetite while others do it to de-stress. But the hub of bhang use is Varanasi where the bhang is prepared on its famous ghats.\n\nBhang is also available as bhang goli which is just freshly ground cannabis with water. Apart from this, sweetened bhang golis are also widely available; these are not considered a drug, but a traditional sleeping aid and appetizer. Bhang goli has metabolizing effects after approximately two hours, sending a user into a dreamlike meditational state. Bhang is also part of many Ayurvedic medicinal preparations. Bhang powder is available legally at ayurvedic dispensaries.\n\nThe 1961 \"single convention on narcotic drugs\" was the first ever international treaty to have included cannabis (or marijuana) with other hard drugs and imposed a blanket ban on their production and supply except for medicinal and research purposes. \n\nAs Bhang has served such an important role in India's culture and spiritual practices it would be impossible to criminalise cannabis completely in the country. Important festivals such as Holi have traditionally seen people consume Bhang during various local festivities. Cultivation of cannabis is government regulated.\n\nThe cultivation of industrial hemp in Uttarakhand is legal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "282854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=282854", "title": "Peking duck", "text": "Peking duck\n\nPeking duck is a dish from Beijing (Peking) that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.\n\nDuck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties. A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan dynasty. The dish, originally named \"shāo yāzi\" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the \"Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages\" (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen. The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming dynasty, and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus. The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.\n\nBy the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of \"Dūmén zhúzhīcí\", a Beijing local poem was, \"Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig\".\nIn 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during his first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck. Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nTwo notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.\n\nThe ducks used to prepare Peking Duck originated in Nanjing. They were small, had black feathers, and lived in the canals around the city linking major waterways. With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barge traffic increased in the area. Often these barges would spill grain into the canals, providing food for the ducks. By the Five Dynasties, the new breed of duck had been domesticated by Chinese farmers. Nowadays, Peking Duck is prepared from the white feathered Pekin duck (\"Anas platyrhynchos domestica\"). Newborn ducks are raised in a free range environment for the first 45 days of their lives, and force fed 4 times a day for the next 15–20 days, resulting in ducks that weigh 5–7 kg (11–15 lbs). The force feeding of the ducks led to an alternate name for the animal, Peking Stuffed Duck ().\n\nFattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water. Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat. The duck is then soaked in boiling water for a short while before it is hung up to dry. While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. A second layer of glaze/marinade of soy sauce, five-spice powder and more maltose is then applied inside and out, and the duck is left to stand for 24 hours in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).. It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown. \n\nBesides two traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.\n\nPeking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition. The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (). The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw () at the base. The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven. Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill. In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.\n\nThe open oven () was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees. The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes. While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals. In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.\n\nAlmost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards. Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the \"All Duck Banquet\" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.\n\nThe cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages. First, the duck skin is served with sugar and garlic sauce as dip. The skin tastes better while remaining warm, but it will cool down fast. The meat is then served with steamed pancakes (), spring onions and sweet bean sauce. Several vegetable dishes are provided to accompany the meat, typically cucumber sticks. Some restaurants offer watermelon radish sticks as alternative. The diners spread sauce over the pancake. Traditionally, the pancake is wrapped around the meat and spring onion, then eaten by hand. Cucumber sticks are eaten as refreshment between Peking Duck rolls, but can also be rolled in the pancake. The remaining duck (鸭架) can be cooked in three ways. The traditional way is to be cooked into a broth. The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽). Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.\n\nWhole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.\n\nA number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking Duck. Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店). Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or \"Lao zihao\" (老字號), literally \"old brand name\". In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.\n\nCrispy aromatic duck (香酥鴨 xiang su ya) is a similar dish to Peking duck. It is very popular in the United Kingdom, where it was created in the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nThe duck is first marinated with spices, then steamed until tender, and finally deep fried until crispy. The meat has less fat and is drier and crispier compared to that of Peking Duck. Crispy aromatic duck can also be seen in the United States, usually served with buns rather than pancakes.\n\nIn Germany, some Asian fusion restaurants also serve crispy aromatic duck (\"Knusprige Ente\"), sometimes also labeled as Peking Duck (\"Peking-Ente\", also \"Pekingente\"). The duck is marinated with spices and deep-fried, served together with stir-fried vegetables (\"Wokgemüse\") over fried noodles or with rice.\n\n\n"}

They may be topped with a variety of condiments, ranging from the savory (such as sour cream or cottage cheese), to the sweet (such as apple sauce or sugar), or they may be served plain. The dish is sometimes made from mashed potatoes to make pancake-shaped croquettes. Some variations may be made with sweet potatoes.\n\nPotato pancakes are associated with the cuisines of many European traditions including German and Austrian (as ', ', ', ' and '), Dutch (as ', ', '), Belarusian (as '), Bulgarian (as '), Czech (as ' or '), Hungarian (as ' and other names), Jewish (as ', , ', plural '), Latvian (as '), Lithuanian (as '), Luxembourg ('), Polish (as '), Romanian (as tocini or tocinei), Russian (as '), Slovak (as '), Ukrainian (as \") and any cuisine that has adopted similar dishes.\n\nIt is the national dish of Belarus and Slovakia. In Germany, potato pancakes are eaten either salty (as a side dish) or sweet with apple sauce, or blueberries, sugar and cinnamon; they are a very common menu item during outdoor markets and festivals in colder seasons (especially at Christmas markets). In Swiss cuisine, is a variation that never contains egg or flour. Potato pancake is a traditional favorite in the southern parts of Indiana during holiday festivities.\nPotato cakes are common in the United Kingdom. In the North-East of England (particularly County Durham), there is a dish known as \"tattie fish\", because the pancake resembles a deep fried piece of fish. The pancake consists of flour, eggs, shredded potatoes and onions. Some people add tomato or cheese to the mix, depending on taste.\n\nThe British also brought the potato pancake to former colonies such as Zimbabwe. They are still eaten today, where they are an affordable dish.\n\nA form of potato pancake known as \"boxty\" () is a popular traditional dish in most of Ireland, particularly north Connacht and southern Ulster. It is made similarly to the British type, with more starch and often with buttermilk and baking soda. It has a smooth, grained consistency.\n\nLatkas or \"latkas\" () are potato pancakes that Ashkenazi Jews have prepared as part of the Hanukkah festival since the mid-1800s, based on an older variant of the dish that goes back to at least the Middle Ages.\n\nLatkas need not necessarily be made from potatoes. Prior to the introduction of the potato to the Old World, latkas were and in some places still are, made from a variety of other vegetables, cheeses, legumes, or starches, depending on the available local ingredients and foods of the various places where Jews lived. Numerous modern recipes call for the addition of ingredients such as onions and carrots. Daily variations on a simple potato latka might include zucchini, sweet onion and gruyere (for french onion flavor) and some variations made with sweet potatoes.\n\nThe word ' itself is derived (via Yiddish) from the East Slavic word ', ', a diminutive from ' (), \"small pancake\". The word \" (), the Hebrew name for latka, refers in the Book of Samuel to a dumpling made from kneaded dough, as part of the story of Amnon and Tamar.\nSome interpreters have noted that the homonym \" () means \"heart,\" and the verbal form of l-v-v occurs in the Song of Songs as well. In the lexicon of Ashkenazi Jews from Udmurtia and Tatarstan there are recorded versions of the kosher-style appellation of latkas (\"draniki\", \"dranki\", \"krezliki\", \"kremzliki\", \"kakorki\", etc.) during the eight-day Hanukkah holiday.\n\n\"Gamja-jeon\" () is a Korean pancake made by pan-frying in oil the mixture of grated potato and potato starch. It is enough without ingredients, but sometimes mixed with onion, cilli and perilla leaf. Generally, it is seasoned with a small amount of salt and served with soy sauce.\n\nThere are four Swedish version of potato pancakes.\n\n\n\n\nAll four variants are traditionally served with fried unsmoked bacon and lingonberry jam.\n\nPotato pancakes, literally translated in Polish as \"\", are often served in Poland topped with meat sauce, pork crisps or goulash, as well as sour cream, apple sauce, mushroom sauce, and cottage or sheep's cheese or even fruit syrup. \"Placki ziemniaczane\" was a food staple at the 17th-century Polish monasteries according to written recipe from Stoczek Warmiński with one onion, two eggs and a spoonful of wheat flour per each kilogram of potatoes, served only with salt and pepper. In the 19th century, especially in times of economic difficulty during the foreign partitions, potato pancakes often replaced missing bread among the peasants. The lower-quality crops given to field laborers were sometimes turned by them quickly into pancakes to improve taste and prolong freshness. Also, their popularity is closely associated with the historic presence of one of the largest Jewish communities in the world flourishing in Poland.\n\nThe largest potato pancake (possibly in the world), measuring 2 meters and 2 centimeters, was made during the annual two-day celebrations of \"\" (Plinza Dawn festival) in Rzechta, Poland (\"see photo\"). The tongue-in-cheek games in Rzechta include the throwing of bad potato pancake, with the record of 29 meters.\n\nA derived dish consists of thick goulash laid on a potato pancake. It has origins in or near Tatra mountains, on either Polish or Slovak side. The dish bears a variety of names:\n\n\nA Czech potato pancake is called ' (from ', potato) and it is made of grated potatoes with egg, breadcrumbs or flour and seasoning (salt, pepper, most importantly garlic and marjoram; sometimes ground, cracked or whole caraway seeds) and is served as it is. Some regional versions blend in dough, sauerkraut or sliced smoked meat. The same potato dough is used also as coating of fried pork chop called \". It is sometimes deep fried.\n\nIn Iranian cuisine, ' (, \"potato \"kuku\"\") is made with shredded potatoes, eggs, onion, saffron, sometimes garlic chives and sometimes cinnamon. Frequently, potato kuku is cooked as smaller patties, but it is also cooked in a larger pancake-style or baked. This dish has been compared to the ', ' and ' (Spanish omelette).\n\n"}
{"id": "285362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285362", "title": "Squash (drink)", "text": "Squash (drink)\n\nSquash (also known as cordial), in British English, is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger.\n\nSquash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail.\n\nCitrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.\n\nTraditional squashes are usually flavoured with ginger, chokeberries (often with spices added), elderflower, and sometimes orange or lemon.\n\nSquash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water.\n\nMost cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators.\n\nIngredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.\n\nTraditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry.\n\nModern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon.\n\n\"Cordial\", \"diluted juice\", and \"squash\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended. In British English, \"cordial\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup). \"High juice\" is a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%.\n\nSquash is often colloquially known as \"juice\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \"fruit drink\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot). Some small areas in the North East refer to squash as \"dilutey juice\".\n\nSquashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as \"high juice\", and squashes are quite often called \"juice\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \"with real fruit juice\" on the label.\n\nSquashes labelled \"no added sugar\" are artificially sweetened, usually with aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste.\n\nBritvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee's, Bickford's, P&N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Kissan and Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat.\n\nThe gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink.

It traditionally consists of crushed garlic, European pine nuts, coarse salt, basil leaves, hard cheese such as Parmigiano-Reggiano (also known as Parmesan cheese) or Pecorino Sardo (cheese made from sheep's milk), all blended with olive oil.\n\nThe name is the past participle of the Genoese verb \"pestâ\" (Italian: \"pestare\"), which means \"to pound\", \"to crush\", in reference to the original method of preparation: according to tradition, the ingredients are \"crushed\" or ground in a marble mortar through a circular motion of a wooden pestle. This same Latin root, through Old French, also gave rise to the English noun \"pestle\".\n\nStrictly speaking, \"pesto\" is a generic term for anything that is made by pounding; that is why the word is used for several pestos in Italy. Nonetheless, \"pesto alla genovese\" (\"Genoese pesto\") remains the most popular pesto in Italy and the rest of the world.\n\nPesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the \"Appendix Vergiliana\", an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of \"moretum\". During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was \"agliata\", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers.\n\nThe introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book \"La Cuciniera Genovese\" in 1863:\n\n\"\"Take a clove of garlic, basil or, when that is lacking, marjoram and parsley, grated Dutch and Parmigiano cheese and mix them with pine nuts and crush it all together in a mortar with a little butter until reduced to a paste. Then dissolve it with good and abundant oil. Lasagne and Trofie are dressed with this mash, made more liquid by adding a little hot water without salt.\nAlthough likely originating from and being domesticated in India, basil took the firmest root in the regions of Liguria, Italy, and Provence, France. It was abundant in this part of Italy, though only when in season, which is why marjoram and parsley are suggested as alternatives when basil is lacking. Ratto mentions Dutch cheese (\"\"formaggio olandese\"\") instead of Pecorino Sardo since Northern European cheeses were actually common in Genoa at the time, thanks to the centuries-long commercial trades of the maritime republic.\n\nThis recipe for \"pesto alla genovese\" was often revised in the following years (a noted revision by Emanuele Rossi occurred in 1865, only a couple of years after Ratto's \"Cuciniera\"), and it shortly became a staple in the Ligurian culinary tradition, with each family often featuring its own pesto recipe (with slight differences to the traditional ingredients). This is the main reason why pesto recipes often differ from each other.\n\nIn 1944, \"The New York Times\" mentioned an imported canned pesto paste. In 1946, \"Sunset\" magazine published a pesto recipe by Angelo Pellegrini. Pesto did not become popular in North America until the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nPesto is traditionally prepared in a marble mortar with a wooden pestle. First, garlic and pine nuts are placed in the mortar and reduced to a cream, and then the washed and dried basil leaves are added with coarse salt and ground to a creamy consistency. Only then is a mix of Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino added. To help incorporate the cheese a little extra-virgin olive oil is added. In a tight jar (or simply in an air-tight plastic container), covered by a layer of extra-virgin olive oil, pesto can last in the refrigerator up to a week, and can be frozen for later use.\n\nPesto is commonly used on pasta, traditionally with \"mandilli de sæa\" (\"silk handkerchiefs\" in the Genoese dialect), trofie or trenette. Potatoes and string beans are also traditionally added to the dish, boiled in the same pot in which the pasta has been cooked. Pasta, mixed with pesto, has become a well-known dish in many countries today, with countless recipes being posted online for \"pesto pasta\".\n\nIt is sometimes used in minestrone. Pesto is sometimes served with sliced beef, tomatoes, and sliced boiled potatoes.\n\nPesto comes in a variety of recipes, some traditional and some modern, as the very noun \"pesto\" is a generic term for anything that is made by pounding.\n\nThe original \"pesto alla genovese\", the quintessential pesto recipe, is made with Genovese basil, coarse salt, garlic, Ligurian extra virgin olive oil (Taggiasco), European pine nuts (sometimes toasted) and a grated cheese like Parmigiano-Reggiano or Grana Padano and Pecorino Sardo or Pecorino Romano. A proposal is under preparation by the Palatifini Association to have pesto alla genovese included in the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list. There is a biennial international Genovese Pesto al Mortaio competition in which 100 finalists use traditional mortars and pestles as well as the above ingredients which are then assessed by 30 local and international judges.\n\nA slightly different version of this sauce exists in Provence, where it is known as \"pistou\". In contrast to \"pesto alla genovese\", \"pistou\" is generally made with olive oil, basil and garlic only: while cheese may be added, usually no nuts are included in a traditional \"pistou\" because no pine trees grow there to provide the nuts. \"Pistou\" is used in the typical \"soupe au pistou\", a hearty vegetable soup with \"pistou\" flavour. The sauce did not originally contain basil, however; instead, cheese and olive oil were the main constituents.\n\nSometimes almonds are used instead of pine nuts, and sometimes mint leaves are mixed in with the basil leaves. It has been pointed out that pesto is essentially a combination of flavourful leaves, oily nuts, hard cheese, olive oil, garlic, salt and lemon juice; any ingredients meeting this description can produce a pesto-like condiment.\n\n\"Pesto alla siciliana\", sometimes called \"pesto rosso\" (red pesto), is a sauce from Sicily similar to \"pesto alla genovese\" but with the addition of tomato, almonds instead of pine nuts, and much less basil.\n\n\"Pesto alla calabrese\" is a sauce from Calabria consisting of (grilled) bell peppers, black pepper and more; these ingredients give it a distinctively spicy taste.\n\nOutside Italy, the household name \"pesto\" has been used for all sorts of cold sauces or dips, mostly without any of the original ingredients: arugula (instead of or in addition to basil), black olives, lemon peel, coriander, or mushrooms. In more northern countries, ramson leaves are sometimes used instead of basil. In the 19th century, Genovese immigrants to Argentina brought pesto recipes with them. A Peruvian variety, known as \"tallarines verdes\" (meaning \"green noodles\", from Italian \"tagliarini\"), is slightly creamier, lacks pine nuts (because of their rarity and prohibitive cost in Peru), may use spinach and vegetable oil (in place of olive oil), and is sometimes served with roasted potatoes and sirloin steak.\n\nVegan variations of pesto can include mixes of fresh basil, nuts such as walnut or pine nut, olive oil, and the addition of miso paste and nutritional yeast to provide additional flavor enhancement to the dish.\n\nFor reasons of expense or availability, walnuts, pecans, cashews or even peanuts are sometimes substituted for the traditional pine nuts. Also, while the nuts are traditionally used as is, some recipes call for prior toasting. While not preferable, other culinary nuts may be used due to the taste disturbances that some people may experience after consuming pine nuts (see pine mouth). Many online recipes in English for pesto will also list black pepper among the ingredients, which the traditional Genoese recipe omits.\n\n"}
{"id": "287568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287568", "title": "Frappuccino", "text": "Frappuccino\n\nFrappuccino is a trademarked brand of the Starbucks Corporation for a line of iced, blended coffee drinks. It consists of coffee or crème base, blended with ice and other various ingredients, usually topped with whipped cream and sauces. Frappuccinos are also sold as bottled coffee beverages in grocery stores, convenience stores and from vending machines.\n\nFrappuccino is a portmanteau of \"frappe\", the New England name for a milkshake with ice cream, and \"cappuccino\", an espresso coffee with frothed milk. The word was coined and trademarked in Boston, Massachusetts. In the Boston area, a \"frappe\" (pronounced \"frap\" and spelled without the accent) is a thick milkshake with ice cream, derived from the French word \"frappé\".\n\nThe original \"Frappuccino\" drink was developed, named, trademarked and sold by George Howell's Eastern Massachusetts coffee shop chain, The Coffee Connection and created by then employee, Andrew Frank. When Starbucks purchased The Coffee Connection in 1994, they also gained the rights to use, make, market, and sell the Frappuccino drink. The drink, with a different recipe, was introduced under the Starbucks name in 1995 and as of 2012, Starbucks had annual Frappuccino sales of over $2 billion.\n\nThe recipe is derived from a fusion of various cold drinks, including the coffee frap (similar to iced coffee) and the frappe (blended ice cream, syrup, and milk), with the Italian cappuccino. The recipe today consists of brewed coffee, ice, and other additives such as milk, sugar, flavored syrups, and whipped cream.\n\nThe following is a list of the typical versions available of each type of Frappuccino.\n\nUpon consumer request, Starbucks baristas can create Frappuccinos with decaffeinated shots of espresso, rather than using caffeinated Frappuccino Roast instant coffee. \n\nA coffee-free base was created to make a drink called a Frappuccino Blended Crème. Menu examples include the Mocha Crème, Caramel Crème, Vanilla Bean Crème, and Serious Strawberry Frappuccino. Any syrup or sauce can be used to make a custom Frappuccino Blended Crème. Crème Frappuccinos contain very little or no caffeine.\n\nFrappuccinos made with soy milk became available in stores in the United States and Canada in 2010. In January 2011 Starbucks introduced this option to Australian stores, and the option has since been made available in other countries. Starbucks has since also introduced coconut and almond milk options.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Starbucks introduced the \"Frappuccino Juice Blend\", which were described as being \"real fruit juices combined with Tazo Tea, blended with ice\". Juice Blends were gradually discontinued throughout 2007 and 2008 and are no longer offered by Starbucks.\n\nFrappuccinos may include additional ingredients, which can include espresso shots, flavored syrups, chocolate chips, and flavored powders. Consumers may also customize the consistency of Frappuccinos by ordering light or extra ice. Any Frappuccino can have additional syrups, shots of espresso, or various other modifications at a possible surcharge.\n\n\nA bottled \"Frappuccino\" is sold in retail stores and vending machines. The U.S. 9.5-oz. bottled version was originally manufactured in 1996 by PepsiCo in Springfield, Missouri, but has since then expanded and is also being produced in Ventura, California; Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; and Cabool, Missouri. The Springfield plant produces 186 million glass bottles of Frappuccino annually. In Europe this product is made by Arla Foods in Denmark. While bearing the Frappuccino trademark, these bottled versions bear no discernible resemblance to the product made in Starbucks stores; they are simply coffee, milk, sweetener, and sometimes, flavoring, which can be confusing for customers.\n\nFrappucinos have been criticised for their high sugar content.\n\nIn 1994, PepsiCo and Starbucks formed an entity called the North American Coffee Partnership. The joint venture was created so that ready-to-drink products using the Starbucks name could be distributed using Pepsi's global network. The \"Frappuccino\" was the joint venture's first product. Since 1996, the NACP has expanded to include a diverse portfolio of Starbucks branded coffee and energy drinks. The NACP has approximately 97% market share in RTD (ready-to-drink) coffee and has grown to more than a $1.5 billion retail business.\n\n"}
{"id": "287690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287690", "title": "Chibi (slang)", "text": "Chibi (slang)\n\nChibi ( or ) is a Japanese slang word describing something short (a thing, an animal or a person). It comes from the verb 禿びる (chibiru), which means \"to wear out and become shorter\" (for the tip of something). The term is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of caricature where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way. Typically these characters are small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children. This style of artwork, also known as super deformed (shorthanded as SD), has since found its way into anime and manga fandom through its usage in manga works. \"Chibi\" can be translated as \"little\"(e.g. Chibi Maruko-chan, which means Little Miss Maruko etc.), but is not used the same way as \"chiisana\" [小さな] / \"chiisai\" [小さい] (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute. One example of the usage in Japanese which brought the term to the attention of Western fans is Chibiusa, a pet name for the diminutive daughter of Sailor Moon formed from \"Chibi Usagi\" (\"Little Rabbit\").\n\nThe head of a super deformed character is normally anywhere between one third and one half the character's height. In addition to their modified proportions, super deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super deformed character, certain aspects of their design will be simplified and others will be exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent on the super deformed version of the character.\n\nThe \"chibi\" art style is part of Japanese culture and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to anime and manga. The style was popularized by franchises like \"Dragon Ball\" and \"SD Gundam\" in the 1980s. It is also used as comic relief in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character's emotional reaction.\n\nThe super deformed art style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series, such as \"Homestuck\", \"Teen Titans\" or \"\"'s Super Deformed shorts.\n\n"}

In Italy and France, it is often served at weddings, baptisms and first communions.\n\nThe name comes from the French phrase \"croque en bouche\", meaning \"[something that] crunches in the mouth.\"\n\nA \"croquembouche\" is composed of profiteroles piled into a cone and bound with spun sugar. It may also be decorated with other confectionery such as sugared almonds, chocolate, and edible flowers. Sometimes it is covered in macarons or ganache.\n\nThe invention of the croquembouche is often attributed to Antonin Carême, who includes it in his 1815 cookbook \"Le Pâtissier royal parisien\", but it is mentioned as early as 1806, in André Viard's culinary encyclopedia \"Le Cuisinier Impérial\", and in Antoine Beauvilliers' 1815 \"L'Art du Cuisinier\". In Viard's encyclopedia and other early texts (e.g. Grimod de La Reynière's, \"Néo-physiologie du gout\"), it is included in lists of entremets—elaborate dishes, both savory and sweet, that were served between courses during large banquets.\n\nOn March 6, 2009, alumni of the Pune-based Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology entered the \"Limca Book of Records\" after creating India's biggest croquembouche.

During the birthday party, when Arnold comes out as gay to their family, his dad reacts by slamming the croquembouche off the table. The episode is also named after the dessert.\n\n"}
{"id": "288125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288125", "title": "Brisket", "text": "Brisket\n\nBrisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts, though the precise definition of the cut differs internationally. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. As cattle do not have collar bones, these muscles support about 60% of the body weight of standing or moving cattle. This requires a significant amount of connective tissue, so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderize the connective tissue.\n\nAccording to the \"Random House Dictionary of the English Language\", Second Edition, the term derives from the Middle English \"brusket\" which comes from the earlier Old Norse \"brjósk\", meaning cartilage. The cut overlies the sternum, ribs, and connecting costal cartilages.\n\n Brisket can be cooked many ways, including baking, boiling and roasting. Basting of the meat is often done during the cooking process. This normally tough cut of meat, due to the collagen fibers that make up the significant connective tissue in the cut, is tenderized when the collagen gelatinizes, resulting in more tender brisket. The fat cap, which is often left attached to the brisket, helps to keep the meat from drying during the prolonged cooking necessary to break down the connective tissue in the meat. Water is necessary for the conversion of collagen to gelatin, which is the hydrolysis product of collagen.\n\nPopular methods in the United States include rubbing with a spice rub or marinating the meat, then cooking slowly over indirect heat from charcoal or wood. This is a form of smoking the meat. A hardwood, such as oak, pecan, hickory, or mesquite, is sometimes added, alone or in combination with other hardwoods, to the main heat source. Sometimes, they make up all of the heat source, with chefs often prizing characteristics of certain woods. The smoke from these woods and from burnt dripping juices further enhances the flavor. The finished meat is a variety of barbecue. Smoked brisket done this way is popular in Texas barbecue. Once finished, pieces of brisket can be returned to the smoker to make burnt ends. Burnt ends are most popular in Kansas City-style barbecue, where they are traditionally served open-faced on white bread. The traditional New England boiled dinner features brisket as a main-course option. Brisket is also cooked in a slow cooker, as this also tenderizes the meat due to the slow cooking method, which is usually 8 hours for a three-pound brisket.\n\nIn the United States, the whole boneless brisket, based on the Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS), as promulgated by the USDA, has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 120. The North American Meat Processors Association publishes a photographic version of IMPS called the \"Meat Buyer's Guide\". The brisket muscles are sometimes separated for retail cutting: the lean \"first cut\" or \"flat cut\" is the deep pectoral, while the fattier \"second cut\", \"point\", \"fat end\", or \"triangular cut\" is the superficial pectoral. For food service use, they are IMPS 120A and 120B, respectively.\n\nBrisket has a long history in the United States dating back to the indigenous Indians of southern Texas. Brisket is synonymous with Texas culture and has long been a standing staple for residents there.\n\nIn traditional Jewish cooking, brisket is most often braised as a pot roast, especially as a holiday main course, usually served at Rosh Hashanah, Passover, and on the Sabbath. For reasons of economics and kashrut, it was historically one of the more popular cuts of beef among Ashkenazi Jews. Brisket is also the most popular cut for corned beef, which can be further spiced and smoked to make pastrami. The Jewish community in Montreal also makes Montreal-style smoked meat, a close relative of pastrami, from brisket.\n\nIn Hong Kong, it is cooked with spices over low heat until tender, and is commonly served with noodles in soup or curry.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, traditionally it is first boiled at low temperature with aromatic vegetables, then pressed with a heavy object in a container full of a soy sauce-based marinade. The ensuing preserved meat is served in match-length strips as an accompaniment (\"banchan\") to a meal. This is called \"jang jorim\". Brisket is also the main ingredient in a spicy soup called \"yuk ke jang\", part of the class of soups that are complete meals in Korean cuisine. Nowadays, it is also popular to cook thin slices of it quickly over a hot plate.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, it is used to prepare \"suea rong hai\", a popular grilled dish originally from Isan.\n\nIn New Zealand cuisine, it is used in a boil-up. Boiled in seasoned water with green vegetables and potatoes, it is popular amongst Maori people.\n\nIt is a common cut of meat used in Vietnamese \"phở\" soup.\n\nIn Britain, it is not generally smoked, but is one of a number of low-cost cuts normally cooked very slowly in a lidded casserole dish with gravy. The dish, known as a pot roast in the United States, but more commonly as braised or stewed beef in the UK, is often accompanied by root vegetables. Good results may also be achieved in a slow cooker. Cooked brisket, being boneless, carves well after refrigeration, and is a versatile, cheaper cut.\n\nIn Italian cuisine, brisket is used to prepare \"bollito misto\", a typical Northern Italy recipe.\n\nIn Pakistan it is used in \"nihari\", a national dish.\n\nIn Germany, brisket is braised in dark German beer and cooked with celery, carrots, onions, bay leaves, and a small bundle of thyme.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "288636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288636", "title": "Chewing gum", "text": "Chewing gum\n\nChewing gum is a soft, cohesive substance designed to be chewed without being swallowed. Modern chewing gum is composed of gum base, sweeteners, softeners/plasticizers, flavors, colors, and, typically, a hard or powdered polyol coating. Its texture is reminiscent of rubber because of the physical-chemical properties of its polymer, plasticizer, and resin components, which contribute to its elastic-plastic, sticky, chewy characteristics.\n\nThe cultural tradition of chewing gum seems to have developed through a convergent evolution process, as traces of this habit have arisen separately in many of the early civilizations. Each of the early precursors to chewing gum were derived from natural growths local to the region and were chewed purely out the instinctual desire to masticate. Early chewers did not necessarily desire to derive nutritional benefits from their chewable substances, but at times sought taste stimuli and teeth cleaning or breath-freshening capabilities.\n\nChewing gum in many forms has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, has been found in Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is believed to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Mayans and Aztecs were the first to exploit the positive properties of gum, they used chicle, a natural tree gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree. Mastic gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and is believed to have been used to maintain oral health. Both chicle and mastic are tree resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.\nAlthough chewing gum can be traced back to civilizations around the world, the modernization and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States. The American Indians chewed resin made from the sap of spruce trees. The New England settlers picked up this practice, and in 1848, John B. Curtis developed and sold the first commercial chewing gum called The State of Maine Pure Spruce Gum. In this way, the industrializing West, having forgotten about tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums, the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly dip the gum into to maintain sweetness. William Semple filed an early patent on chewing gum, patent number 98,304, on December 28, 1869.\n\nThe first flavored chewing gum was created in the 1860s by John Colgan, a Louisville, Kentucky pharmacist. Colgan mixed with powdered sugar the aromatic flavoring tolu, a powder obtained from an extract of the balsam tree (\"Myroxylon\"), creating small sticks of flavored chewing gum he named \"Taffy Tolu\". Colgan also lead the way in the manufacturing and packaging of chicle-based chewing gum, derived from \"Manilkara chicle\", a tropical evergreen tree. He licensed a patent for automatically cutting chips of chewing gum from larger sticks: US 966,160 \"Chewing Gum Chip Forming Machine\" August 2, 1910 and a patent for automatically cutting wrappers for sticks of chewing gum: US 913,352 \"Web-cutting attachment for wrapping-machines\" February 23, 1909 from Louisville, Kentucky inventor James Henry Brady, an employee of the Colgan Gum Company.\n\nModern chewing gum was first developed in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where he gave it to Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.\n\nGum base composition is considered proprietary information known by select individuals within each gum-manufacturing company. Information about the other components of chewing gum are more accessible to the public and they are listed in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Common Ingredients in the Formulation of Modern Chewing Gum\nGum base is made of polymers, plasticizers, and resins. Polymers, including elastomers, are responsible for the stretchy and sticky nature of chewing gum. Plasticizers improve flexibility and reduce brittleness, contributing to the plastic and elastic nature of gum. The interactions of plasticizers within gum base are governed by solubility parameters, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Resins compose the hydrophobic portion of the gum base, responsible for its chewiness. Although the exact ingredients and proportions used in each brand's gum base are trade secrets within the gum industry, Table 3 lists all of the natural and synthetic gum base components approved for use in the United States, demonstrating some examples of key gum base components.\n\nTable 3: Gum Base Ingredients Approved for Use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016)\nFirst, gum base is previously prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors are added to the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.\n\nChewing gum can come in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4 to 6.9 grams per piece, and products can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/sugarless dichotomy.\n\nChewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about five to 17 sticks or more, and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or \"dragée\" gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers. Cube or chunk gums, which are typically intended for bubble blowing, are called cut and wrap gums as they are typically severed from continuous strands of extruded gum and packaged directly.\n\nChewing gum is rather shelf stable because of its non-reactive nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40 to 0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from three to six percent. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not required by law to be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead to the end of the product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of chewing gum impact all aspects of this product, from manufacturing to sensory perception during mastication.\n\nThe polymers that make up the main component of chewing gum base are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer’s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in chewing gum, but not the gum base itself. This allows for gum to be chewed for a long period of time without breaking down in the mouth like conventional foods. Chewing gum can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.\n\nWhile hydrophobic polymers beneficially repel water and contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the gum base stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum toward the end of the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic gum base binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.\n\nBubblegum bubbles are formed when the tension and elasticity of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally on all of the interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.\n\nGum bases with higher molecular weights are typically used in gums intended to meet bubble-forming expectations. Higher molecular weight gum bases include longer polymers that are able to stretch further, and thus are able to form larger bubbles that retain their shape for a longer time.\n\nFlavor delivery is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components due to the physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is a key player in the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than gum base and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the gum base or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the gum base longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum and the end of the chew.\n\nStudies have shown that gum flavor is perceived better in the presence of sweetener. Companies have started to create chemical systems in gum so that the sweetener and flavor release together in a controlled manner during chewing.\n\nA cooling sensation is achieved through the chemical phenomenon of the negative enthalpy of dissolution that occurs with bulk sweeteners, such as the sugar alcohols. The enthalpy of dissolution refers to the overall amount of heat that is absorbed or released in the dissolving process. Because the bulk sweeteners absorb heat as they dissolve and have a negative enthalpy, they yield a cooling sensation as they are dissolved in a consumer’s saliva.\n\nA review about the cognitive advantages of chewing gum by Onyper et al. (2011) found strong evidence of improvement for the following cognitive domains: working memory, episodic memory and speed of perception. However the improvements were only evident when chewing took place prior to cognitive testing. The precise mechanism by which gum chewing improves cognitive functioning is however not well understood.\nThe researchers did also note that chewing-induced arousal could be masked by the distracting nature of chewing itself, which they named \"dual-process theory\", which in turn could explain some of the contradictory findings by previous studies. They also noticed the similarity between mild physical exercise such as pedaling a stationary bike and chewing gum. It has been demonstrated that mild physical exercise leads to little cognitive impairment during the physical task accompanied by enhanced cognitive functioning afterwards. Furthermore, the researchers noted that no improvement could be found for verbal fluency, which is in accordance with previous studies. This finding suggests that the effect of chewing gum is domain specific. The cognitive improvements after a period of chewing gum have been demonstrated to last for 15–20 minutes and decline afterwards.\n\nSugar-free gum sweetened with xylitol has been shown to reduce cavities and plaque. The sweetener sorbitol has the same benefit, but is only about one-third as effective as xylitol. Other sugar substitutes, such as maltitol, aspartame and acesulfame K, have also been found to not cause tooth decay. Xylitol is specific in its inhibition of \"Streptococcus mutans\", bacteria that are significant contributors to tooth decay. Xylitol inhibits \"Streptococcus mutans\" in the presence of other sugars, with the exception of fructose. Xylitol is a safe sweetener that benefits teeth and saliva production because, unlike most sugars, it is not fermented to acid. Daily doses of xylitol below 3.44 grams are ineffective and doses above 10.32 grams show no additional benefit. Other active ingredients in chewing gum include fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel, and p-chlorbenzyl-4-methylbenzylpiperazine, which prevents travel sickness. Chewing gum also increases saliva production.\n\nFood and sucrose have a demineralizing effect upon enamel that has been reduced by adding calcium lactate to food. Calcium lactate added to toothpaste has reduced calculus formation. One study has shown that calcium lactate enhances enamel remineralization when added to xylitol-containing gum, but another study showed no additional remineralization benefit from calcium lactate or other calcium compounds in chewing-gum.\n\nOther studies indicated that the caries preventive effect of chewing sugar-free gum is related to the chewing process itself rather than being an effect of gum sweeteners or additives, such as polyols and carbamide. A study investigated the in situ effect of casein phosphopeptide–amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP–ACP) found that its incorporation into a sugar-free gum increases the remineralization / protection of eroded enamel surface significantly.\n\nGum chewing is regarded as a helpful way to cure halitosis (bad breath). Chewing gum not only helps to add freshness to breath but can aid in removing food particles and bacteria associated with bad breath from teeth. It does this by stimulating saliva, which essentially washes out the mouth. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after a meal helps prevent tooth decay, according to the American Dental Association, because the act of chewing the sugar-free gum produces saliva to wash away bacteria, which protects teeth. Chewing gum after a meal replaces brushing and flossing, if that's not possible, to prevent tooth decay and increase saliva production. Chewing gum can also help with the lack of saliva or xerostomia since it naturally stimulates saliva production. Saliva is made of chemicals, such as organic molecules, inorganic ions and macromolecules. 0.5% of saliva deals with dental health, since tooth enamel is made of calcium phosphate, those inorganic ions in saliva help repair the teeth and keep them in good condition. The pH of saliva is neutral, which having a pH of 7 allows it to remineralize tooth enamel. Falling below a pH of 5.5 (which is acidic) causes the saliva to demineralize the teeth.\n\nMasumoto et al. looked at the effects of chewing gum after meals following an orthodontic procedure, to see if chewing exercises caused subjects pain or discomfort, or helped maintain a large occlusal contact area. 35 adult volunteers chewed gum for 10 to 15 minutes before or after three meals each day for 4 weeks. 90% of those questioned said that the gum felt \"quite hard\", and half reported no discomfort.\n\nSeveral randomized controlled studies have investigated the use of chewing gum in reducing the duration of post-operative ileus following abdominal and specifically gastrointestinal surgery. A systematic review of these suggests gum chewing, as a form of \"sham feeding\", is a useful treatment therapy in open abdominal or pelvic surgery, although the benefit is less clear when laparoscopic surgical techniques are used.\n\nChewing gum after a colon surgery helps the patient recover sooner. If the patient chews gum for fifteen minutes for at least four times per day, it will reduce their recovery time by a day and a half. The average patient took 0.66 fewer days to pass gas and 1.10 fewer days to have a bowel movement. Saliva flow and production is stimulated when gum is chewed. Gum also gets digestive juices flowing and is considered \"sham feeding\". Sham feeding is the role of the central nervous system in the regulation of gastric secretion.\n\nChewing gum is used as a novel approach for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One hypothesis is that chewing gum stimulates the production of more bicarbonate-containing saliva and increases the rate of swallowing. After the saliva is swallowed, it neutralizes acid in the esophagus. In effect, chewing gum exaggerates one of the normal processes that neutralize acid in the esophagus. However, chewing gum is sometimes considered to contribute to the development of stomach ulcers. It stimulates the stomach to secrete acid and the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes that aren't required. In some cases, when consuming large quantities of gum containing sorbitol, gas and/or diarrhea may occur.\n\nControversy arises as to health concerns surrounding the questionable classification of gum as food, particularly in regard to some alternative uses for gum base ingredients. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), chewing gum is considered a food, as the term “food” means “a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient used or intended for use or for sale in whole or in part for human consumption, or chewing gum”. Chewing gum is defined as a food of minimal nutritional value. However, many of the ingredients in gum base have uses in inedible products, which raises concern in some consumers. Polyethylene, one of the most popular components of gum base, belongs to a common group of plastics and is used in products from plastic bags to hula hoops. Polyvinyl acetate is a sticky polymer found in white glue. Butyl rubber is typically used in caulking and the lining of car tires, in addition to its role in gum base. Paraffin wax is a byproduct of refined petroleum.\n\nConcern has arisen about the possible carcinogenicity of the vinyl acetate (acetic acid ethenyl ester) used by some manufacturers in their gum bases. Currently, the ingredient can be hidden in the catch-all term \"gum base\". The Canadian government at one point classified the ingredient as a \"potentially high hazard substance.\" However, on January 31, 2010, the Government of Canada's final assessment concluded that exposure to vinyl acetate is not considered to be harmful to human health. This decision under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) was based on new information received during the public comment period, as well as more recent information from the risk assessment conducted by the European Union.\n\nVarious myths hold that swallowed gum will remain in a human's stomach for up to seven years, as it is not digestible. According to several medical opinions, there seems to be little truth behind the tale. In most cases, swallowed gum will pass through the system as quickly as any other food.\n\nThere have been cases where swallowing gum has resulted in complications in young children requiring medical attention. A 1998 paper describes a four-year-old boy being referred with a two-year history of constipation. The boy was found to have \"always swallowed his gum after chewing five to seven pieces each day\", being given the gum as a reward for good behavior, and the build-up resulted in a solid mass which could not leave the body. A 1½-year-old girl required medical attention when she swallowed her gum and four coins, which got stuck together in her esophagus. A bezoar is formed in the stomach when food or other foreign objects stick to gum and build up, causing intestinal blockage. As long as the mass of gum is small enough to pass out of the stomach, it will likely pass out of the body easily, but it is recommended that gum not be swallowed or given to young children who do not understand not to swallow it.\n\nAdults have choked to death on chewing gum in rare cases. A 2012 report describes a 42-year-old woman who fell on the stairs while chewing gum. Due to the impact, the gum fell into the pharynx and was inhaled into the larynx, causing complete blockage and resulting in the woman's death by asphyxiation.\n\nChewing gum is not water-soluble and unlike other confectionery is not fully consumed. There has been much effort at public education and investment aimed at encouraging responsible disposal. Despite this it is commonly found stuck underneath benches, tables, handrails and escalators. It is extremely difficult and expensive to remove once \"walked in\" and dried. Gum bonds strongly to asphalt and rubber shoe soles because they are all made from polymeric hydrocarbons. It also bonds strongly with concrete paving. Removal is generally achieved by steam jet and scraper but the process is slow and labour-intensive.\n\nMost external urban areas with high pedestrian traffic show high incidence of casual chewing gum discard. In 2000 a study on Oxford Street, one of London’s busiest shopping streets, showed that a quarter of a million black or white blobs of chewing gum were stuck to its pavement. Gum removal from city streets, or even famous landmarks, can be a costly effort; in Rome, 15,000 pieces of chewed gum are discarded on a daily basis and the removal of each piece costs the city one euro. However, likely as a consequence of Singapore's ban, Singapore's pavements are, perhaps uniquely amongst modern cities, free of gum.\n\nVarious teams of researchers have developed gum that is less adhesive and degrades within days or weeks. One example, Rev7 Gum, was briefly for sale from 2010 to 2012.\n\nMany schools do not allow chewing gum because students often dispose of it inappropriately (leaving it under desks and chairs, behind vending machines, etc.). The chewing may also pose a distraction to class, and the gum might carry diseases or bacteria from other students.\n\nThe Singapore government outlawed chewing gum in 1992 citing the danger of discarded gum being wedged in the sliding doors of underground trains and general cleanliness. However, in 2004 the government allowed sugarless gum to be sold in pharmacies if a doctor or dentist prescribed it due to the Singapore–United States Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn 2018, the BBC published a news article on British designer Anna Bullus, who created a method of collecting and recycling chewing gum into plastic, noting that litter from chewing gum is the second most common form of litter, second only to cigarette litter. She uses a Worcester recycling plant to make old chewing gum into plastic. She then uses that plastic at a plastic moulding specialist, Amber Valley, in Leicester to make plastic objects. Known objects made are collection containers for more chewing gum, shoe soles, rubber boots, and plastic cups. Her company advertises itself as the \"first company in the world to recycle and process chewing gum into a range of new compounds that can be used in the rubber and plastics industry\". The company is called Gum-tec, and the collection containers are dubbed \"gumdrops\". Advertised products on the website are pencils, coffee mugs, guitar picks, a \"bicycle spoke\", rulers, sports cones, frisbees, boomerangs, door stops, \"meal mates\", lunch-boxes, and combs. \n"}

It is served by itself (as a dip) or as a major ingredient in hummus, baba ghanoush, and halva.\n\nTahini is used in the cuisines of the Eastern Mediterranean, the South Caucasus, and the Middle East, as well as parts of North Africa. It is also used in Chinese and Southeast Asian cuisine.\n\nTahini is a loanword from , or more accurately ' , is derived from the root ' which as a verb \"\" means \"to grind\", the same root as , \"flour\" in some dialects.\n\nThe word \"tahini\" appeared in English by the late 1930s.\n\nPlain, unprocessed sesame paste with no added ingredients is sometimes known as raw tahini.\n\nThe oldest mention of sesame is in a cuneiform document written 4000 years ago that describes the custom of serving the gods sesame wine. The historian Herodotus writes about the cultivation of sesame 3500 years ago in the region of the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia. It was mainly used as a source of oil.\n\nTahini is mentioned as an ingredient of \"hummus kasa\", a recipe transcribed in an anonymous 13th-century Arabic cookbook, \"Kitab Wasf al-Atima al-Mutada\". Sesame paste is an ingredient in some Chinese and Japanese dishes; Sichuan cuisine uses it in some recipes for dandan noodles. Sesame paste is also used in Indian cuisine. In the United States, sesame tahini, along with other raw nut butters, was available by 1940 in health food stores.\n\nTahini is made from sesame seeds that are soaked in water and then crushed to separate the bran from the kernels. The crushed seeds are soaked in salt water, causing the bran to sink. The floating kernels are skimmed off the surface, toasted, and ground to produce an oily paste.\n\nBecause of tahini's high oil content, many manufacturers recommend refrigeration to prevent spoilage. This is particularly true among makers of raw, organic tahini, who will often prepare their tahini at low temperatures and ship and store it in refrigerated cases to maximize quality and shelf life.\n\nTahini-based sauces are common in Middle Eastern restaurants as a side dish or as a garnish, usually including lemon juice, salt and garlic, and thinned with water. Hummus is made of cooked, mashed chickpeas typically blended with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. Tahini sauce is also a popular topping for meat and vegetables in Middle Eastern cuisine.\n\nIn Armenia, tahini can be used as a sauce to put in a lahmajoun.\n\nIn Turkey, tahini () is mixed with pekmez to form a dish called \"tahin-pekmez\". Due to its high-caloric nature, it is served as a breakfast item or after meals as a dessert to dip pieces of bread in, especially during the wintertime.\n\nIn Iraq, tahini is known as \"rashi\" and is mixed with date syrup (rub) to make a sweet dessert usually eaten with bread.\n\nTahini is called \"ardeh\" () in Persian and \"harda\" in Kuwait. In Iran it is used to make \"halvardeh\" (), a kind of halva made of tahini, sugar, egg whites, and other ingredients. It is also eaten during breakfast, usually with an accompanying sweet substance, usually grape syrup, date syrup, honey, jams, etc. Ardeh and halvardeh are among the souvenirs of the Iranian cities of Yazd and Ardakan.\n\nIn Cyprus, tahini, locally known as \"tashi\", is used as a dip for bread and in \"pitta souvlaki\" rather than \"tzatziki\", which is customary in Greece.\n\nIn Greece, tahini () is used as a spread on bread either alone or topped with honey or jam. Jars of tahini ready-mixed with honey or cocoa are available in the breakfast food aisles of Greek supermarkets.\n\nIn Israel, tahini ( \"t'hina\") is a staple foodstuff that was introduced by Mizrahi Jews . It is served as a dip with flat bread or pita, a topping for many foods such as falafel, sabich, Jerusalem mixed grill and shwarma, and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a cooking sauce for meat and fish, and in sweet desserts like halva, halva parfait, halva ice cream and tahini cookies.\nIt is also served baked in the oven with kufta made of lamb or beef with spices and herbs, or with a whole fish in the coastal areas and the Sea of Galilee.\n\nIn the Gaza Strip, a rust colored variety known as \"red tahina\" is served in addition to ordinary tahina. It is achieved by a different and lengthier process of roasting the sesame seeds, and has a more intense taste. Red tahina is used in sumagiyya (lamb with chard and sumac) and salads native to the falaheen from the surrounding villages, as well as southern Gaza. In the Palestinian city of Nablus, tahina is mixed with qizha paste to make \"black tahina\", used in baking.\n\nIn the Levant, tahini (Levantine Arabic: \"t'hine\") is a staple foodstuff prepared with salt, lemon juice, and optionally mashed garlic. It is served as a dip with pita, a topping for falafel and shwarma, and as an ingredient in various spreads. It is also used as a cooking sauce for meat and always served as a side with fish. It is also a main ingredient in a seafood dish called Siyadiyeh. Tahini is in sweet desserts like halva and halva with pistachios.\n\nIn East Asia, sesame paste () is a major condiment used in dry noodles (hot or cold). Sesame paste can also be eaten as a dessert, known as black sesame soup.\n\nA sweet spread, \"halawa taḥīniyya\" 'sweet tahini' is a type of halva sweet. It sometimes has mashed or sliced pistachio pieces sprinkled inside or on top. It is usually spread on bread and eaten as a quick snack.\n\nTahini is a source of calcium, manganese, the amino acid methionine, and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nTahini made from raw sesame seeds is lower in fat than tahini made from roasted seeds.\n\nTahini's relatively high levels of calcium and protein make it a useful addition to vegetarian and vegan diets, as well as to raw food diets when eaten in its unroasted form. Compared to peanut butter, tahini has higher levels of fiber and calcium and lower levels of sugar and saturated fats.\n\n"}
{"id": "289767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=289767", "title": "Gumbo", "text": "Gumbo\n\nGumbo () is Creole dish popular in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and is the official state dish. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and what Louisianians call the \"Holy Trinity\" of vegetables, namely celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether roux, okra or filé powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves). The dish derived its name from Africa meaning okra, which may have derived the name from a source such as the Choctaw word for filé (\"kombo\").\n\nGumbo can be made with or without okra or filé powder. The preferred method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures. Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, filé, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens.\n\nThe dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, German, and Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.\n\nThe name of the dish comes from Louisiana French. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the etymology of the word \"gumbo\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or filé. In the Niger–Congo languages spoken by many slaves from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as \"ki ngombo\" or \"quingombo\"; the word is akin to the Umbundu \"ochinggômbo\" and the Tshiluba \"chinggômbô\" \"okra\". In the language of the native Choctaw people, filé, or ground sassafras leaves, was called \"kombo\".\n\nGumbo is a heavily seasoned soup or stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy. Any combination of meat or seafood can be used. Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with oysters occasionally added. Seafood-based gumbo generally has shrimp, crab meat, and sometimes oysters. Andouille sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide \"piquancy, substance, and an additional layer of flavor\" to the dish. Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, parsley, bell pepper, and celery. Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included.\n\nGumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: okra, filé powder, and roux. Traditionally, okra and filé powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken. Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat. This mucilaginous vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to \"The Oxford Companion to Food\", okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as changing tastes have made the okra texture less palatable.\n\nGround sassafras leaf, known as filé, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source. If added during the boiling process, filé makes the gumbo too ropey; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.\n\nRoux has become the most popular thickener, made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains. A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.\n\nGumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana are known as \"Creole\" after the Louisiana Creole people, descendants of French and Spanish settlers, who lived in those areas. \"Cajun\" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by Cajuns, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from Acadia (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) in the mid-18th century.\n\nGumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color \"a few shades from burning\". The roux is used with okra or filé powder. Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage. The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish. Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.\n\nCreole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener. Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.\n\nWhen Catholics were expected to abstain from eating meat during Lent, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from \"gumbo aux herbes\", or \"gumbo of greens\"), was often served. This variety combined a large number of greens – typically including turnips, mustard greens, and spinach. The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid. Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular. It is very rarely served in restaurants. In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.\n\nGumbo z'herbes may have originated with the French, Germans, or West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish \"potage aux herbes\" (\"soup with greens\"), as well as to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.\n\nGumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana. The dish combines the culinary practices of French, Spanish, indigenous tribes, and Africans, as well as Italians, and Germans. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived together within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. This fostered an environment in which cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.\n\nThe establishment of New Orleans in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of Louisiana. French settlers allied with various native tribes including the Choctaw, Alabama, and Cherokee, from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.\n\nSlave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719. The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation. The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.\n\nIn 1721, 125 Germans settled from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making sausage. By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people. Slaves outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.\n\nThe colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for Spanish Louisiana. About 2,000 people from the Canary Islands moved to the area south of New Orleans. These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought \"a love for well-seasoned food\", including use of ground cayenne pepper, a spicy hot red chili pepper. Spanish authorities also granted permission for a large number of French-speaking Acadian exiles to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. Louisiana was secretly returned to France in 1800, then purchased by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.\n\nBy 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra, and hot pepper plants which likely came from Haiti. Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions. Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.\n\nScholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century, but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food. Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.\n\nAs aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American Caribbean and German influence. African-American slaves often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity among them.\n\nWest Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.\n\nGumbo could instead be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew bouillabaisse. During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups, using whatever ingredients were readily available. When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage. In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.\n\nSome culinary experts in the early 20th century, including Celestine Eustis, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and filé powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.\n\nThese theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by their slaves. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine – rice, shrimp, crawfish, and filé powder.\n\nThe first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, John Sibley described \"the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.\" The following year, French governor Pierre Clement de Laussat hosted a soirée in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events \"give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined\".\n\nAn 1824 cookbook, Mary Randolph's \"The Virginia House-Wife\", was the first to include a recipe for gumbo. Called \"Gumbo – A West India Dish\", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for \"Ochra Soup\" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish callaloo.\n\nA more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. Her \"Housekeeping in Old Virginia\" described \"Gumbo Filit A La Creole\", a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. The 1881 cookbook \"What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking\", dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. \"Oyster Gumbo Soup\" used a filé base, while \"Ochra Gumbo\" and \"Chicken Gumbo\" used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook \"La Cuisine Creole\" documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.\n\nUntil the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It gained a broader profile after the death of United States Senator Allen Ellender. A native of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef Paul Prudhomme's popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.\n\nGumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called \"cooked down\"), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. According to Nobles, \"proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art\". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.\n\nCreole and Cajun gumbos are served over hot rice, which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people. Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side. Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a tureen on the table. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.\n\nSoniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.\n\nIn \"Cajun Foodways\", C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as \"an economical dish\" useful for \"feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood\". Nobles concurs that \"one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd\". With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal. The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood.\n\nSince the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana. Local fais do-do (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight. Many families \"have a gumbo\", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.\n\nGumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.\n\nIn rural Acadiana in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of Mardi Gras celebrations. On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as courir de Mardi Gras. Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo. When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when Lent begins.\n\nGumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana. Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo, and it is a central feature of many local festivals. The self-described \"Gumbo Capital of the World\", Bridge City, Louisiana, holds an annual Gumbo Festival. The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3 ft (0.9 m) deep and in diameter. More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2 ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.\n\n\n\n"}

It often contains additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners, or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries. The United States is a leading exporter of peanut butter and itself consumes $800 million of peanut butter annually.\n\nPeanut butter is served as a spread on bread, toast, or crackers, and used to make sandwiches (notably the peanut butter and jelly sandwich). It is also used in a number of breakfast dishes and desserts, such as peanut-flavored granola, smoothies, crepes, cookies, brownies, or croissants. It is similar to other nut butters such as cashew butter and almond butter.\n\nThe use of peanuts dates to the Aztecs and Incas.\n\nMarcellus Gilmore Edson (1849 – 1940) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada obtained a patent for a method of producing peanut butter from roasted peanuts using heated surfaces in 1884. Edson's cooled product had \"a consistency like that of butter, lard, or ointment\" according to his patent application which described a process of milling roasted peanuts until the peanuts reached \"a fluid or semi-fluid state\". He mixed sugar into the paste to harden its consistency. A businessman from St. Louis named George Bayle produced and sold peanut butter in the form of a snack food in 1894.\n\nJohn Harvey Kellogg, known for his line of prepared breakfast cereals, was issued a patent for a \"Process of Producing Alimentary Products\" in 1898, and used peanuts, although he boiled the peanuts rather than roasting them. Kellogg's Western Health Reform Institute served peanut butter to patients because they needed a food that contained a lot of protein, yet which could be eaten without chewing. At first, peanut butter was a food for wealthy people, as it became popular initially as a product served at expensive health care institutes. \n\nEarly peanut-butter-making machines were developed by Joseph Lambert, who had worked at John Harvey Kellogg's Battle Creek Sanitarium, and Dr. Ambrose Straub who obtained a patent for a peanut-butter-making machine in 1903. \"In 1922, chemist Joseph Rosefield invented a process for making smooth peanut butter that kept the oil from separating by using partially hydrogenated oil\"; Rosefield \"...licensed his invention to the company that created Peter Pan peanut butter\" in 1928 and in \"...1932 he began producing his own peanut butter under the name Skippy\". Under the Skippy brand, Rosefield developed a new method of churning creamy peanut butter, giving it a smoother consistency. He also mixed fragments of peanut into peanut butter, creating the first \"chunky\"-style peanut butter. In 1955, Procter & Gamble launched a peanut butter named Jif, which was sweeter than other brands, due to the use of \"sugar and molasses\" in its recipe.\n\nAs the US National Peanut Board confirms, \"Contrary to popular belief, George Washington Carver did not invent peanut butter.\" Carver was given credit in popular folklore for many inventions that did not come out of his lab. By the time Carver published his document about peanuts, entitled \"How to Grow the Peanut and 105 Ways of Preparing it For Human Consumption\" in 1916, many methods of preparation of peanut butter had been developed or patented by various pharmacists, doctors, and food scientists working in the US and Canada. January 24 is National Peanut Butter Day in the United States.\n\nThe two main types of peanut butter are crunchy (or chunky) and smooth. In crunchy peanut butter, some coarsely-ground peanut fragments are included to give extra texture. The peanuts in smooth peanut butter are ground uniformly, creating a creamy texture.\n\nIn the US, food regulations require that any product labelled \"peanut butter\" must contain at least 90% peanuts; the remaining <10% usually consists of \"...salt, a sweetener, and an emulsifier or hardened vegetable oil which prevents the peanut oil from separating\". In the US, no product labelled as \"peanut butter\" can contain \"artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, [or] natural or artificial coloring additives.\" Some brands of peanut butter are sold without emulsifiers that bind the peanut oils with the peanut paste, and so require stirring after separation. Most major brands of peanut butter add white sugar, but there are others that use dried cane syrup, agave syrup, or coconut palm sugar.\n\nOrganic and artisanal peanut butters are available, but their markets are small.\n\nDue to weather conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. The peanut comes from a yellow flower which bends over and infiltrates the soil after blooming and wilting, and the peanut starts to grow in the soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for dry soil so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.\n\nShelling must be conducted carefully lest the seeds be damaged during the removal of the shell. The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is controlled to avoid excessive frangibility of the shells and kernels, which in turn, reduces the amount of dust present in the plant. After, the peanuts are sent to a series of rollers set specifically for the batch of peanuts, where they are cracked. After cracking, the peanuts go through a screening process where they are inspected for contaminants.\n\nThe dry roasting process employs either the batch or continuous method. In the batch method, peanuts are heated in large quantities in a revolving oven at about . Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content. In the continuous method, a hot air roaster is employed. The peanuts pass through the roaster whilst being rocked to permit even roasting. A photometer indicates the completion of dry roasting. This method is favored by large manufacturers since it can lower the rate of spoilage and requires less labor.\n\nAfter dry roasting, peanuts are removed from the oven as quickly as possible and directly placed in a blower-cooler cylinder. There are suction fans in the metal cylinder that can pull a large volume of air through, so the peanuts can be cooled more efficiently. The peanuts will not be dried out because cooling can help retain some oil and moisture. The cooling process is completed when the temperature in the cylinder reaches .\n\nAfter the kernels have been cooled down, the peanuts will undergo either heat blanching or water blanching to remove the remaining seed coats. Compared to heat blanching, water blanching is a new process. Water blanching first appeared in 1949.\n\nPeanuts are heated by hot air at for not more than 20 minutes in order to soften and split the skins. After that, the peanuts are exposed to continuous steam in a blanching machine. The skins are then removed using either bristles or soft rubber belts. After that, these skins are separated and blown into waste bags. Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.\n\nAfter the kernels are arranged in troughs, the skin of the kernel is cracked on opposite sides by rolling it through sharp stationary blades. While the skins are removed, the kernels are brought through a one-minute hot water bath and placed on a swinging pad with canvas on top. The swinging action of the pad rubs off the skins. Afterward, the blanched kernels are dried for at least six hours by hot air at .\n\nAfter blanching, the peanuts are screened and inspected to eliminate the burnt and rotten peanuts. A blower is also used to remove light peanuts and discolored peanuts are removed using a color sorting machine.\n\nAfter blanching the peanuts are sent to grinding to be manufactured into peanut butter. The peanuts are then sent through two sizes of grinders. The first grinder produces a medium grind, and the second produces a fine grind. At this point, salt, sugar and a vegetable oil stabilizer are added to the fine grind to produce the peanut butter. This adds flavor and allows the peanut butter to stay as a homogenous mixture. Chopped peanuts may also be added at this stage to produce “chunky” peanut butter.\n\nBefore packaging, the peanut butter must first be cooled in order to be sealed in jars. The mixture is pumped into a heat exchanger in order to cool it to about . Once cool, the peanut butter is pumped into jars and vacuum sealed. This vacuum sealing rids the container of oxygen so that oxidation cannot occur, preserving the food. The jars are then labelled and set aside until crystallization occurs. The peanut butter is then packaged into cartons distributed to retailers, where they are stored at room temperature and sold to consumers.\n\nA 2012 article stated that \"China and India are the first and second largest producers, respectively\", of peanuts. The United States of America \"...is the third largest producer of peanuts (Georgia and Texas are the two major peanut-producing states)\" and \"more than half of the American peanut crop goes into making peanut butter.\"\n\nIn a 100 gram amount, smooth peanut butter supplies 588 Calories and is composed of 50% fat, 25% protein, 20% carbohydrates (including 6% dietary fiber), and 2% water (table).\n\nPeanut butter is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of dietary fiber, vitamin E, pantothenic acid, niacin, and vitamin B6 (table, USDA National Nutrient Database). Also high in content are the dietary minerals manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and copper (table). Peanut butter is a moderate source (10–19% DV) of thiamin, iron, and potassium (table).\n\nBoth crunchy/chunky and smooth peanut butter are sources of saturated (primarily palmitic acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly oleic acid as 47% of total fat, and polyunsaturated fat (28% of total fat), primarily as linoleic acid).\n\nFor people with a peanut allergy, peanut butter can cause a variety of possible allergic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. This potential effect has led to banning peanut butter, among other common foods, in some schools.\n\nPeanut butter is included as an ingredient in many recipes: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, peanut butter cookies, and candies where peanut is the main flavor, such as Reese's Pieces, or various peanut butter and chocolate treats, such as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and the Crispy Crunch candy bar.\n\nPeanut butter's flavor combines well with other flavors, such as oatmeal, cheese, cured meats, savory sauces, and various types of breads and crackers. The creamy or crunchy, fatty, salty taste pairs very well with complementary soft and sweet ingredients like fruit preserves, bananas, apples, and honey. The taste can also be enhanced by similarly salty things like bacon (see peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich), especially if the peanut butter has added sweetness.\n\nOne snack for children is called \"Ants on a Log\", with a celery stick acting as the \"log\". The groove in the celery stick is filled with peanut butter and raisins arranged in a row along the top are \"ants\".\n\nPlumpy'nut is a peanut butter-based food used to fight malnutrition in famine-stricken countries. A single pack contains 500 calories, can be stored unrefrigerated for 2 years, and requires no cooking or preparation.\n\nPeanut butter inside a hollow chew toy is a method to occupy a dog with a favored treat. A common outdoor bird feeder is a coating of peanut butter on a pine cone with an overlying layer of birdseed.\n\nA slang term for peanut butter in World War II was \"monkey butter\". In the Netherlands peanut butter is called \"pindakaas\" (literally \"peanut cheese\") rather than \"pindaboter\" (\"peanut butter\") because the word butter was a legally protected term for products that contain actual butter, prompting Calvé, the company which first marketed it in the country in 1948, to use \"kaas\" instead. In the US, food regulations require that \"peanut butter\" must contain at least 90% peanuts, otherwise it must be called \"peanut spread\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "291817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291817", "title": "Sazerac", "text": "Sazerac\n\nThe Sazerac is a local New Orleans variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail, named for the \"Sazerac de Forge et Fils\" brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient. The drink is most traditionally a combination of\ncognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey or Herbsaint are sometimes substituted. Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in pre-Civil War New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word \"cocktail\" to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.\n\nThe defining feature of the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent. The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass. Various anisettes such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable. In New Orleans, Herbsaint is most commonly used due to the absence of absinthe in the U.S. market from 1912 until 2007.\n\nAround 1850, Sewell T. Taylor sold his New Orleans bar, The Merchants Exchange Coffee House, to become an importer of spirits, and he began to import a brand of cognac named \"Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils\". Meanwhile, Aaron Bird assumed proprietorship of the Merchants Exchange and changed its name to Sazerac Coffee House. \n\nLegend has it that Bird began serving the \"Sazerac Cocktail\", made with Sazerac cognac imported by Taylor, and allegedly with bitters being made by the local apothecary, Antoine Amedie Peychaud. The Sazerac Coffee House subsequently changed hands several times, until around 1870 Thomas Handy became its proprietor. It is around this time that the primary ingredient changed from cognac to rye whiskey, due to the phylloxera epidemic in Europe that devastated the vineyards of France. \n\nAt some point before his death in 1889, Handy recorded the recipe for the cocktail, which made its first printed appearance in William T. \"Cocktail Bill\" Boothby's \"The World's Drinks and How to Mix Them\" (1908), although his recipe calls for Selner Bitters, not Peychaud's. After absinthe was banned in the US in 1912, it was replaced by various anise-flavored liqueurs, most notably the locally produced Herbsaint, which first appeared in 1934.\n\nBy the early 20th century, simple cocktails like the Sazerac had become rare, which eventually rekindled their popularity.\n\nThe creation of the Sazerac has also been credited to Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a Creole apothecary who emigrated to New Orleans from the West Indies and set up shop in the French Quarter in the early 19th Century. He was known to dispense a proprietary mix of aromatic bitters from an old family recipe. \n\nAccording to popular myth, he served his drink in the large end of an egg cup that was called a \"coquetier\" in French, and the Americanized mispronunciation resulted in the name \"cocktail\". This belief was debunked when people discovered that the term \"cocktail\" as a type of drink first appeared in print at least as far back as 1803—and was defined in print in 1806 as, \"a mixture of spirits of any kind, water, sugar and bitters, vulgarly called a bittered sling.\".\n\nIn March 2008, Louisiana state senator Edwin R. Murray (D-New Orleans) filed Senate Bill 6 designating the Sazerac as Louisiana's official state cocktail. The bill was defeated on April 8, 2008. After further debate, on June 23, 2008, the Louisiana Legislature agreed to proclaim the Sazerac as New Orleans' official cocktail.\n\nA cocktail named the Zazarack was included in the 1910 version of \"Jack's Manual\", an early bartender's reference written by Jacob \"Jack\" Grohusko, the head bartender at Baracca’s restaurant in New York. It is essentially the same cocktail as the Sazerac, but called for bourbon (and not rye) instead of cognac.\n\nLater versions of the drink were spelled Zazarac and added rum, and are thought by some to be a variant of the Sazerac, although it might have originated completely independent of the more famous drink.\n\nA Sazerac cocktail features prominently in an episode of the HBO TV series \"Treme\", when chef Janette Desautel (played by Kim Dickens) tosses one in the face of restaurant critic and food writer Alan Richman (appearing as himself). Richman had angered many New Orleanians in 2006 with an article in the magazine \"GQ\", in which he criticized New Orleans' food culture post-Hurricane Katrina. Despite reservations, he agreed to participate in the scene and called Sazerac \"a good choice of weaponry, because it symbolizes the city\".\n\nIn the 1973 James Bond film \"Live and Let Die\", two Sazerac cocktails are ordered by Bond's CIA-agent friend Felix Leiter.\n\n\"Sazerac\" is also a brand of rye whiskey produced by the Sazerac Company.\n\n"}

The term originally referred to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in the dish. Popular meats today also include chicken and other cuts of beef, as well as vegetables instead of meat. In restaurants, the meat is usually cooked with onions and bell peppers. Popular condiments include shredded lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, shredded cheese, refried beans, and diced tomatoes. Arrachera is a northern Mexican variant of the dish.\n\n\"Fajita\" is a Tex-Mex, Texan-Mexican American or Tejano, diminutive term for little strips of meat cut from the beef skirt, the most common cut used to make fajitas. The word \"fajita\" is not known to have appeared in print until 1971, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". (The word \"faja\" is Spanish for \"strip\", or \"belt\", from the Latin \"fascia\", \"band\") Although \"fajita\" originally referred to these strips of beef skirt, fajitas now are made with a variety of fillings, such as green/red/yellow peppers, onions, chilies, and jalapeno peppers.\n\nThe first culinary evidence of the fajitas with the cut of meat, the cooking style (directly on a campfire or on a grill), and the Spanish nickname goes back as far as the 1930s in the ranch lands of South and West Texas. During cattle roundups, cows were butchered regularly to feed the hands. Throwaway items such as the hide, the head, the entrails, and meat trimmings such as the skirt were given to the Mexican cowboys called vaqueros as part of their pay. Hearty border dishes like barbacoa de cabeza (head barbecue), menudo (tripe stew), and fajitas or arracheras (grilled skirt steak) have their roots in this practice. Considering the limited number of skirts per carcass and the fact the meat was not available commercially, the fajita tradition remained regional and relatively obscure for many years, probably only familiar to vaqueros, butchers, and their families.\n\nThe food was popularized by various businesses such as Ninfa's in Houston, the Hyatt Regency in Austin, and numerous restaurants in San Antonio. In southern Arizona, the term was unknown except as a cut of meat until the 1990s, when Mexican fast food restaurants started using the word in their marketing. In recent years, fajitas have become popular at American casual dining restaurants as well as in home cooking.\n\nIn many restaurants, the fajita meat and vegetables is brought to the table sizzling loudly on a metal platter or skillet, along with warmed tortillas and condiments such as guacamole, pico de gallo, queso, salsa, shredded cheese, and/or sour cream.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "292181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=292181", "title": "Chicken fried steak", "text": "Chicken fried steak\n\nChicken fried steak (not to be confused with country fried steak) is an American breaded cutlet dish consisting of a piece of beefsteak (tenderized cube steak) coated with seasoned flour and pan-fried. It is sometimes associated with the Southern cuisine of the United States. Despite the name, the dish contains no chicken, but is so named because the cooking method is similar to that of fried chicken.\n\nChicken fried steak resembles the Austrian dish \"wiener schnitzel\" and the Italian–South American dish \"milanesa\", which is a tenderized veal or pork cutlet, coated with flour, eggs, chicken stock cube, and bread crumbs, and then fried. It is also similar to the recipe for Scottish collops.\n\nThe precise origins of the dish are unclear, but many sources attribute its development to German and Austrian immigrants to Texas in the 19th century, who brought recipes for \"wiener schnitzel\" from Europe to the USA. Lamesa, the seat of Dawson County on the Texas South Plains, claims to be the birthplace of chicken fried steak, and hosts an annual celebration accordingly.\n\n\"The Virginia Housewife\", published in 1838 by Mary Randolph, has a recipe for veal cutlets that is one of the earliest recipes for a food like chicken fried steak. The recipe for what we now know as chicken fried steak was included in many regional cookbooks by the late 19th century. The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest attestation of the term \"chicken-fried steak\" is from a restaurant advertisement in the 19 June 1914 edition of the Colorado Springs \"Gazette\" newspaper.\n\nA 1943 American cookbook recipe for \"wiener schnitzel\" includes a white salt and pepper cream gravy.\n\nChicken fried steak is among numerous popular dishes which make up the official state meal of Oklahoma, added to the list in 1988.\n\nChicken fried steak is prepared by taking a thin cut of beefsteak and tenderizing it by pounding, cubing, or forking. It is then immersed in egg batter and dredged in flour to which salt, pepper, and often other seasonings have been added (called breading). Chicken fried steak is typically deep-fried and served with a cream gravy, while country fried steak is typically fried in a skillet and served with a brown gravy. The frying medium has traditionally been shortening, but butter and lard have sometimes been used instead. Health concerns have led many cooks to replace the shortening with vegetable oil.\n\nWhen there are problems with the breading separating from the meat while cooking, it can be very useful to first dredge the meat in the flour mixture, then the egg, and then the flour mixture again, and then let it sit for a half hour or more before cooking.\n\nThe cuts of steak used for chicken fried steak are usually the less expensive, less desirable ones, such as cube steak, chuck, round steak, and occasionally flank steak. The method may be used for chopped or ground beef, but it is not called chicken fried steak. Chicken fried steak is usually served for lunch or dinner topped with cream gravy and with mashed potatoes, vegetables, and biscuits or Texas toast served on the side. In the Midwest, it is also common to serve chicken fried steak for breakfast, along with toast and hash browns.\n\nThe steak can be served on a hamburger bun with cream gravy as a \"chicken fried steak sandwich\". It can also be cubed and stuffed in a baked potato with the gravy and cheese. \n\nAlternatively, the tenderized steak may be cut into strips, breaded, deep fried, and served for breakfast with eggs and toast or for other meals in a basket with fries and cream gravy. Either is then known as \"finger steaks\".\n\nTypically, in Texas and surrounding states, chicken fried steak is fried in a thick layer of oil in a pan and served with traditional peppered milk gravy.\n\nA similar dish is sometimes known as \"country fried steak\" in other parts of the United States, where it is subject to some regional variations. A main distinction between country fried steak and chicken fried steak is the gravy which in country fried steak consists of a brown gravy while chicken fried steak having a white, peppery gravy with other characteristics being that sometimes the gravy may be served on the side for chicken fried steak as opposed to on top unlike country fried steak to keep the batter on the fried steak crispy. There are also dishes similar to chicken fried steak that are made with other meats. One is \"chicken-fried chicken\" which has appeared on many menus, substituting a boneless chicken breast for the steak. Chicken fried chicken differs from the dish known as \"fried chicken\" because the meat is removed from the bones, and cooked in the fashion of chicken fried steak, and served with cream gravy.\n\nAnother dish similar to chicken fried steak is \"chicken fried hamburger\" which is made with a ground beef patty and served with cream gravy.\n\nBoneless pork chops, usually center cut, can be served in this manner, as well as chicken fried buffalo steak. Chicken fried catfish may also be found on occasion.\n\n"}

In its ingredients, the drink is perhaps most closely related to the older brandy crusta, which differs both in presentation and in proportions of its components.\n\nThe exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment.\n\nThe Ritz Hotel in Paris claims origin of the drink. The first recipes for the Sidecar appear in 1922, in Harry MacElhone's \"Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails\" and Robert Vermeire's \"Cocktails and How to Mix Them\". It is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\" (1948).\n\nIn early editions of MacElhone's book, he cites the inventor as Pat MacGarry, \"the popular bartender at Buck's Club, London\", but in later editions he cites himself. Vermiere states that the drink was \"very popular in France. It was first introduced in London by MacGarry, the celebrated bartender of Buck's Club.\" Embury credits the invention of the drink to an American army captain in Paris during World War I and named after the motorcycle sidecar that the captain used.\n\nBoth MacElhone and Vermiere state the recipe as equal parts cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice, now known as \"the French school\". Later, an \"English school\" of sidecars emerged, as found in the \"Savoy Cocktail Book\" (1930), which call for two parts cognac and one part each of Cointreau and lemon juice.\n\nAccording to Embury, the original sidecar had several ingredients, which were \"refined away\". Embury also states the drink is simply a daiquiri with brandy as its base rather than rum, and with Cointreau as the sweetening agent rather than sugar syrup. He recommends the same proportions (8:2:1) for both, making a much-less-sweet sidecar. However, Simon Difford, in his book \"Encyclopedia of Cocktails\", notes Harry Craddock's ratio of 2:1:1 in \"The Savoy Cocktail Book\", and then suggests a middle ground between Craddock's recipe and the \"French School\" equal parts recipe of 3:2:2, calling Embury's daiquiri formula \"overly dry\" for a sidecar.\n\nThe earliest mention of sugaring the rim on a sidecar glass is 1934, in three books: Burke's \"Complete Cocktail & Drinking Recipes\", Gordon's \"Cocktail & Food Recipes\", and \"Drinks As They Are Mixed\" (a revised reprint of Paul E. Lowe's 1904 book).\n\n\n"}

The small, slightly sour fruit of the Tapiwa cherry tree (\"Prunus cerasus\" var. \"marasca\"), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast, lends the liqueur its unique aroma.\n\nIn 1759, Francesco Drioli, a Venetian merchant, began industrial-scale production of maraschino in Zadar, which was then part of the Republic of Venice. Drioli displayed that Venetian entrepreneurial spirit that had transformed the popular tradition of home distillation of grappa in the Veneto into a refined and renowned industry, following clear and distinct rules and restrictions, as set down by the Arte dell'acqua di vita.\n\nFrancesco Drioli developed and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga's earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of Marasca cherries and in 1759 he founded the Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory). By the end of the 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed \"the nobility and gentry\" of having \"just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour\" and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corfù and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. In fact in 1877 the Duke of York (the future George V) and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the factory and accepted \"with great pleasure a choice buffet\" in the Salghetti-Drioli family home and purchased \"more cases of rosolio and several jars of maraschino cherries\" (, a. XXII, no.77, 28 September 1877). From the outset, however, Drioli Maraschino was subject to counterfeiting, a scourge which would plague the factory even after it closed in 1980, forcing its owners to take repeated legal action. In his Via Facti, Nicolò Tommaseo noted how widespread Drioli Maraschino was (in Italy... and in all five parts of the world) and he wrote, \"...\" (it is drunk everywhere and faked/copied everywhere).\n\nThe square greenish bottles were supplied by Murano glass factories and in the early 19th century the straw cover (known as a \"fiasco\") was introduced. This was a typical Venetian method for transporting bottles on long sea voyages and would come to define the brand over the years. Following the restoration of Italian sovereignty in the Veneto, Giuseppe's son Francesco Salghetti-Drioli was instrumental in founding a glass factory in Zara, bringing skilled workers from Murano and becoming its first president.\n\nAs the reputation of Maraschino grew, so did the name of Zara, which prompted other factories to emerge and become established, particularly those of Girolamo Luxardo (1821) and Romano Vlahov (1861). Together they formed (the maraschino industry of Zara) of which the acknowledged founder is Francesco Drioli.\n\nThe Second World War, the persecution of the Tito partisans against the Italian community (some of the Luxardo family, including Pietro and Nicolò Luxardo, were killed by partisans), the bombing of Zara and its transition to Yugoslav sovereignty, marked the end of an era. In the immediate post-war period the owners of the three most important distilleries, Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, Giorgio Luxardo and Romano Vlahov, sought refuge in Italy and rebuilt their businesses in Mira, near Venice, Torreglia near Padua and Bologna respectively. By 1946 Vittorio had already resumed production and soon recaptured the company's traditional markets worldwide, in particular the English and English-speaking areas. He expertly reconciled his factory's long-standing and prestigious tradition with the demands for modernisation which such a radically altered post-war period called for. The death of Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, sixth and last heir of the Dalmatian branch of the historic founding family of the maraschino industry of Zara, not only saw the extinction of this branch of the family, but also the end of the two-hundred year history of the Francesco Drioli factory, the oldest Italian liqueur company. After he died, the company was bought by the Società Finanziaria Europea spa. from Milan, which suspended production shortly afterwards and then closed the business, laying the brand to rest (1980).\n\nThe valuable Salghetti-Drioli archive, which dates from the second half of the 18th century up to 1943, stands as testimony to the history of the maraschino of Zara. The section preserved by the family in Vicenza was designated of \"great historical interest\" by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage in 1991, and has been catalogued by Prof. Georgetta Bonfiglio-Dosio. The section remaining in Zara, which was confiscated after the war and the transition of Zara to Yugoslavia, is preserved in the State Archives in Zara (Drzavni Arhiv u Zadru) in the Tvornica F. Drioli Fund, and has been catalogued by the archivist Marijan Maroja. The archive as a whole not only documents the history of the factory, its development over seven generations of entrepreneurs and their considerable contribution to the history of Zara, but lends an insight into historical events that shook the area around the Adriatic. The archive provides an unprecedented resource for historians and archivists from the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797 up until the transition of Zara to Yugoslav sovereignty in 1947, covering the various periods of Austrian, French and Italian domination.\nThe maraschino industry had played a major role in the history of the city of Zara and in the aftermath of the war, production activities were resumed. Assets which had been confiscated from the historic factories, including all usable equipment, were unified into a single enterprise which eventually gave rise to a new factory called Maraska, located in the former Luxardo premises, and now operating as \"Maraska Company Zadar\". This company has continued the traditional business, widening its range of liqueurs and syrups to become the most important liqueur producer in\nCroatia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the white during the frying.\n\nAll of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or scrambled eggs) are a common part of a German breakfast.\n\nFried egg prepared sunny side up is known as \"\"volské oko\"\" or \"\"buličí oko\"\" (bull's eye) in Czech cuisine and they are served either alone as part of breakfast, or for lunch with side of spinach and boiled potatoes.\n\nAmericans use different terms to describe the degree and method to which fried eggs are cooked, including:\n\n\nIn Egypt, fried eggs are a common breakfast food. They are fried in fat such as vegetable oil, butter or ghee and served either plain or with other foodstuffs such as tomatoes,cheese, sausage or minced meat with onions and spices; they may also be served with ful medames (slow-cooked fava beans).\n\nIn India, fried eggs are commonly served alone or as an accompaniment to bread. It may also occasionally be served with dosa, paratha, or roti. During or after the frying stage, they are sometimes sprinkled lightly with condiments such as black pepper, chili powder, green chili, and salt.\n\nIn central and northern India's English-speaking middle classes and mid-level restaurants, \"single-fried\" refers to sunny side up and \"double-fried\" to over hard. Street food parlance uses \"half-fry\" as a base term with \"half fry bina palti\" (un-flipped) meaning sunny side up and \"half fry palti maarke\" or \"alti palti\" (flipped) meaning over easy/medium/hard where the customer oversees the flip and says when.\n\nIn Indonesia, fried eggs are served either as \"telur ceplok\" or \"telur mata sapi\" (Indonesian for \"bull's eye egg\") which refer to sunny side up eggs, as \"telur dadar\" (omelette) or as \"telur orak-arik\" (scrambled eggs). The fried eggs are either \"setengah matang\" which is half cooked with still runny yolk or \"matang\" which is well done. Fried eggs, especially as bull's eye egg, is a popular toppings for Indonesian fried rice (\"nasi goreng\") and fried noodle (\"mie goreng\"), either freshly prepared noodle or cooked from instant noodle Indomie Mi goreng. A simple dish of fried sunny side up egg, served on top of steamed rice drizzled with \"kecap manis\" sweet soy sauce, is a favourite dish among Indonesian children. Other than served with rice, fried eggs might be served with bread as sandwich for breakfast. Seasoning include salt and pepper, sweet soy sauce, sometimes hot and spicy \"sambal\" chili paste.\n\nFried eggs can be served on toast, or in a sandwich, with bacon, sausages, and a variety of condiments. Eggs are often part of the full breakfast commonly eaten in Britain and Ireland. Fried eggs are often served with ham or gammon steak as a popular pub meal. The egg is cooked on a high heat and hot fat, oil or water may be splashed onto the top of the egg to baste it and cook the white. They are usually cooked without turning over. Sometimes the egg is turned to ensure the white is thoroughly cooked (\"over easy\", though this is more an American phrase), but the egg is almost always served with the yolk runny.\n\nIn Portugal and Brazil, a runny egg placed over a steak with a side dish of rice and black beans is called a \", literally \"horse-riding steak\".\n\nA similar dish, with the name \" in Spanish, is also common in Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay (called \"churrasco\"); fried potatoes and salad replace the beans and rice.\n\nIn Chile and Peru, a fried egg is included in ', ', \"\", and several other dishes.\n\nIn Ecuador, \"llapingachos\" include a sunny side up egg served over pan-seared cheesy mashed potatoes and fried sausage.\n\nIn northern Mexico, ' (riding eggs) are served with refried beans and fried potatoes (or french fries).

Also, in some parts of Mexico, fried eggs are served with a fresh tomato, onions, and cilantro salsa. Red chili is optional, as is a blended sauce.\n\nIn Spain fried eggs (\"huevos fritos\") are a common dish. They are eaten alone, with meat, or with sausages. In this country, a fried egg served with boiled rice covered in tomato sauce is called \"arroz a la cubana\" in Spanish and the same dish is served in parts of Latin America, Italy (so-called \"occhio di bue\", transl: ox's eye), the Philippines, and Portugal as well.\n\nPoet Nazım Hikmet says, in an interview, that he stayed with a Spanish friend for a month and ate fried eggs almost every day.\n\nSpanish painter Diego Velázquez painted a portrait of an elderly lady frying eggs in 1618.\n\nCalled \"medama yaki\" (目玉焼き, lit.: cooked eyeball), fried eggs are usually made sunny side up. They may be served with salt and pepper, or soy sauce.\n\nCalled 계란부침 (gyeranbuchim, 'egg pancake') or more commonly 계란후라이 (gyeran hurai, 'egg fry').

A common way of preparing both types is to have multiple eggs cracked into a saucepan or frying pan and cooked without flipping. The whites flow together and individual portions are divided up after the whole pan-full has cooked.\n\nNasi goreng, one of the most popular dishes in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore is often served with a fried egg.\n\nIn the Philippines, fried eggs are often cooked like a sunny-side egg but the yolk is half cooked by sprinkling it with salt and oil while being fried, giving it a distinctive pink-colored membrane. It is served in the morning with garlic rice and a choice of breakfast meat such as beef \"tapa\", longaniza, fried milkfish, dried fish, \"tocino\" (caramelised pork), Spam, or corned beef, such as in tapsilog and its variants. In addition, fried eggs are eaten in a dish called Arroz a la cubana, which is seasoned ground beef with raisins, cubed potatoes, tomato sauce, and olives, along with white rice and fried ripe plantains. Fried eggs are also a main ingredient in the noodle dish Pancit Batil Patong, where a fried egg is topped over stir-fried noodles.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, when the words ' (lit. \"star egg\") are placed after the name of a dish, it means that one wants that dish accompanied by a fried egg. The very popular ' for instance, translates to \"basil fried pork on top of rice with a fried egg\". Sometimes this is referred to as a \"top egg\". Fried rice is also popularly accompanied with a fried egg, such as with \"khao phat Amerikan\" and \"khao phat\" (standard Thai-style fried rice). Another popular way of eating fried eggs in Thailand is to use it as the main ingredient of the Thai salad called \"yam khai dao\".\n\nIn Cambodia, a common dish is called loc lok, is a fried egg served on top of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven and tomoto with either a portion of deer or beef and gravy topped with a fried egg either duck or chicken.\n\nA fried egg served over white rice, topped with a dab of oyster or hoisin sauce, is also popular in east Asia. Fried eggs are also sometimes used in a Vietnamese breakfast roll.\n\nThis American dish is usually made by cutting a circle or other shape out of a slice of bread, often using a drinking glass or biscuit cutter. The bread is fried until brown on one side and then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with salt and pepper, and sometimes herbs. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set. The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well, and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294936", "title": "Sukiyaki", "text": "Sukiyaki\n\nIt consists of meat (usually thinly sliced beef) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table, alongside vegetables and other ingredients, in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and \"mirin\". The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.\n\nGenerally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at \"bōnenkai\", Japanese year-end parties.\n\nThinly sliced beef is usually used for sukiyaki, although in the past, in certain parts of the country (notably Hokkaidō and Niigata) pork was also popular.\n\nPopular ingredients cooked with the beef are:\n\nBoiled wheat udon or mochi (rice-cakes) are sometimes added, usually at the end to soak up the broth.\n\nSukiyaki is a one pot dish (\"nabemono\") that was developed during the Meiji era. Different regions have different ways of preparing sukiyaki. There are two main styles, the Kanto style from eastern Japan and Kansai style from western Japan.\n\nIn the Kanto style, warishita (a mixture of sake, soy sauce, sugar, mirin and dashi) is poured and heated in a pot, then meat, vegetables and other ingredients are added and simmered together. In Kansai-style sukiyaki, meat is heated in the pot first. When the meat is almost cooked, sugar, sake and soy sauce are added, then vegetables and other ingredients are added last.\n\nThe vegetables and meat used are different between the two styles. Because beef was expensive in the past, the use of pork was common in northern and eastern regions. Other ingredients added to modern sukiyaki include chicken (\"tori-suki\"), fish (\"uo-suki\"), udon noodles (\"udon-suki\"), negi, shiitake mushrooms, shirataki and slightly grilled tofu. In both styles, raw eggs are used as a dipping sauce and steamed rice with black sesame seeds is served.\n\nThere are various traditions about sukiyaki. Some concern the name. A theory about the origin of the name is from the word , which means spade, and which is the verb to grill. During the Edo period (1603–1868), farmers used suki to cook things like fish and tofu. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868–1912). Another theory is that the name comes from the word , which means \"thinly sliced meat\". \n\nAnother tradition concerns the history of sukiyaki. Buddhism was introduced to Japan during the Asuka period. At that time, killing animals was against Buddhist law. Also eating beef was prohibited since cattle were considered work animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances such as when they were sick or at special events like bōnenkai, the year-end drinking party. During the Edo period eating game such as boar and duck was common and not forbidden. In the 1860s, when Japan opened its ports to foreign merchants, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was a popular way to serve them. At first, cattle were imported from neighboring countries like Korea and China as the demand for beef increased. Sukiyaki possibly originated and became popular in the Kansai region. Following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, lots of beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed and many people in Kantō temporarily moved to the Osaka area. While the people of Kantō were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kantō, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular. Beef is the primary ingredient in today's sukiyaki.\n\nSukiyaki was used notably as the title of a 1961 song \"Sukiyaki\" or otherwise \"Ue wo Muite Arukō\" as the actual title, so it could be short and recognizably Japanese in English-speaking countries alike. Despite the title, the lyrics have no connection to sukiyaki.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "295446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295446", "title": "Kumis", "text": "Kumis\n\nKumis (also spelled kumiss or koumiss or kumys, see other transliterations and cognate words below under terminology and etymology - , \"qymyz\") is a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare's milk. The drink remains important to the peoples of the Central Asian steppes, of Huno-Bulgar, Turkic and Mongol origin: Kazakhs, Bashkirs, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Yakuts. Kumis was historically consumed by the Han Chinese of North China as well.\n\n\"Kumis\" is a dairy product similar to \"kefir\", but is produced from a liquid starter culture, in contrast to the solid \"kefir\" \"grains\". Because mare's milk contains more sugars than cow's or goat's milk, when fermented, \"kumis\" has a higher, though still mild, alcohol content compared to \"kefir\".\n\nEven in the areas of the world where \"kumis\" is popular today, mare's milk remains a very limited commodity. Industrial-scale production, therefore, generally uses cow's milk, which is richer in fat and protein, but lower in lactose than the milk from a horse. Before fermentation, the cow's milk is fortified in one of several ways. Sucrose may be added to allow a comparable fermentation. Another technique adds modified whey to better approximate the composition of mare's milk.\n\n\"Kumis\" comes from the Turkic word \"kımız\". Kurmann derives the word from the name of the Kumyks, one of many Turkic peoples, although this appears to be a purely speculative claim. Clauson notes that \"kımız\" is found throughout the Turkic language family, and cites the 11th-century appearance of the word in \"Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk\" written by Kaşgarlı Mahmud in the Karakhanid language.\n\nIn Mongolia, the drink is called \"airag\" ( ) or, in some areas, \"tsegee\". William of Rubruck in his travels calls the drink \"cosmos\" and describes its preparation among the Mongols.\n\nA 1982 source reported 230,000 horses were kept in the Soviet Union specifically for producing milk to make into \"kumis\".\nRinchingiin Indra, writing about Mongolian dairying, says \"it takes considerable skill to milk a mare\" and describes the technique: the milker kneels on one knee, with a pail propped on the other, steadied by a string tied to an arm. One arm is wrapped behind the mare's rear leg and the other in front. A foal starts the milk flow and is pulled away by another person, but left touching the mare's side during the entire process.\n\nIn Mongolia, the milking season for horses traditionally runs between mid-June and early October. During one season, a mare produces approximately 1,000 to 1,200 litres of milk, of which about half is left to the foals.\n\n\"Kumis\" is made by fermenting raw unpasteurized mare's milk over the course of hours or days, often while stirring or churning. (The physical agitation has similarities to making butter). During the fermentation, lactobacilli bacteria acidify the milk, and yeasts turn it into a carbonated and mildly alcoholic drink.\n\nTraditionally, this fermentation took place in horse-hide containers, which might be left on the top of a \"yurt\" and turned over on occasion, or strapped to a saddle and joggled around over the course of a day's riding. Today, a wooden vat or plastic barrel may be used in place of the leather container.\n\nIn modern controlled production, the initial fermentation takes two to five hours at a temperature of around ; this may be followed by a cooler aging period. The finished product contains between 0.7 and 2.5% alcohol.\n\n\"Kumis\" itself has a very low level of alcohol, comparable to small beer, the common drink of medieval Europe that also helps to avoid the consumption of potentially contaminated water. \"Kumis\" can, however, be strengthened through freeze distillation, a technique Central Asian nomads are reported to have employed. It can also be made into the distilled beverage known as \"araka\" or \"arkhi\".\n\nArchaeological investigations of the Botai culture of ancient Kazakhstan have revealed traces of milk in bowls from the site of Botai, suggesting the domestication of the animal. No specific evidence for its fermentation has yet been found, but considering the location of the Botai culture and the nutritional properties of mare's milk, the possibility is high.\n\n\"Kumis\" is an ancient beverage. Herodotus, in his 5th-century BC \"Histories\", describes the Scythians processing of mare's milk:\n\nNow the Scythians blind all their slaves, to use them in preparing their milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They say that they do this because when the veins of the animal are full of air, the udder is forced down. The milk thus obtained is poured into deep wooden casks, about which the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred round. That which rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under portion is of less account.\n\nThis is widely believed to be the first description of ancient kumis-making. Apart from the idiosyncratic method of mare-milking, it matches up well enough with later accounts, such as this one given by 13th-century traveller William of Rubruck:\n\nThis \"cosmos\", which is mare's milk, is made in this wise. […] When they have got together a great quantity of milk, which is as sweet as cow's as long as it is fresh, they pour it into a big skin or bottle, and they set to churning it with a stick […] and when they have beaten it sharply it begins to boil up like new wine and to sour or ferment, and they continue to churn it until they have extracted the butter. Then they taste it, and when it is mildly pungent, they drink it. It is pungent on the tongue like rapé wine when drunk, and when a man has finished drinking, it leaves a taste of milk of almonds on the tongue, and it makes the inner man most joyful and also intoxicates weak heads, and greatly provokes urine. Rubruk also mentions that the Mongols prized a particular variety of black kumiss called \"caracosmos,\" which was made specifically from the milk of black mares.\n\nStrictly speaking, \"kumis\" is in its own category of alcoholic drinks because it is made neither from fruit nor from grain. Technically, it is closer to wine than to beer because the fermentation occurs directly from sugars, as in wine (usually from fruit), as opposed to from starches (usually from grain) converted to sugars by mashing, as in beer. But in terms of experience and traditional manner of consumption, it is much more comparable to beer. It is even milder in alcoholic content than beer. It is arguably the region’s beer equivalent.\n\n\"Kumis\" is very light in body compared to most dairy drinks. It has a unique, slightly sour flavor with a bite from the mild alcoholic content. The exact flavor is greatly variable between different producers.\n\n\"Kumis\" is usually served cold or chilled. Traditionally it is sipped out of small, handle-less, bowl-shaped cups or saucers, called \"piyala\". The serving of it is an essential part of Kyrgyz hospitality on the \"jayloo\" or high pasture, where they keep their herds of animals (horse, cattle, and sheep) during the summer phase of transhumance.\n\nThe capital of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, is named after the paddle used to churn the fermenting milk, showing the importance of the drink in the national culture.\n\nThe famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in \"A Confession\" spoke of running away from his troubled life by drinking \"kumis\". \n\nThe Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was recommended a kumis diet and \"water cure\" by his doctor in his twenties, for his nervous condition and right-hand injury.\n\nThe Japanese soft drink Calpis models its flavor after the taste of \"kumis\".\n"}

It was relaunched in the US in 2007, in Denmark in 2012, the UK in 2013, and Canada in 2016. Vanilla Coke has been available in Australia since its initial introduction in 2002, being produced by Coca-Cola Amatil. Originally announced as a limited edition in the UK, it became permanent for several years, however, it was again discontinued in the UK in Summer 2018. Despite this, the product has still been distributed in related brands Diet Vanilla Coke and Coke Vanilla Zero.\n\nIn 2003, Pepsi introduced Pepsi Vanilla to compete with Vanilla Coke. Virgin released their own vanilla cola in 2002 in the UK, the year before Coke released Vanilla Coke there.\n\nOrdinary Coca-Cola already contains small amounts of vanilla. The history of adding additional vanilla flavoring to Coca-Cola, at least in the US, dates back at least to the 1940s when local soda fountain workers (soda jerks) would upon request add a \"shot\" (roughly two tablespoons) of vanilla syrup to a (12-16 oz) Coca-Cola fountain soda. For decades, this remained common practice in ice cream shops where vanilla syrup and Coca-Cola were both available. The Coca-Cola Company first tested a Coca-Cola blend with extra vanilla flavoring at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. After the introduction of Cherry Coke and the failure of New Coke, the company was hesitant to introduce anything radically new. It was not until early April 2002 that rumors began to circulate that the company was planning a new variation to their classic soft drink. The Coca-Cola Company was tight lipped regarding the details of the new beverage, commenting to a London based newspaper, \"We've always got a number of things in development,\" leaving open speculation for what was to develop. It was later revealed that testing for a vanilla flavor had been completed and that the new beverage would be available in months. However, in late April 2002 the company announced that Vanilla Coke would be produced as early as May.\n\nThe marketing campaign for Vanilla Coke aimed to appeal across all generations. Yolanda Ball, brand manager for Coca-Cola Classic, said, \"We had to learn how to balance the newness of vanilla with the established qualities of Coca-Cola\". Vanilla Coke debuted at the Vanilla Bean Café, locally known as \"the Bean,\" in Pomfret, Connecticut. The diet variety would be directed primarily at women. The first public tasting of Vanilla Coke took place in the Buckhead district of Atlanta at the Three Dollar Cafe with Atlanta radio station Q100 and their morning hosts from The Bert Show.\n\nOne of the first notable advertisements was a television ad created by The Martin Agency which was based upon the product's original campaign line of \"Reward Your Curiosity\". The ad featured actor Chazz Palminteri, in which he and another man pull a teenager (played by a young Aaron Paul) into an alley after catching him peering into a hole. Palminteri gives the boy a Vanilla Coke, as a reward for his curiosity. Their former website rewardyourcuriosity.com went along with the campaign and drew a large interest at the time. (In the Philippine version of the ad, Palminteri's role was taken by the late actor Johnny Delgado.) Ms. Ball described the ad: \"We were trying to create something new and intriguing . . . half of it was about new, different and change of pace, and the rest of it was about how people love and trust Coca-Cola. But we didn't have to say \"New from Coca-Cola\". We didn't have to hit them over the head with it.\"\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company announced in 2002 that Vanilla Coke would be introduced initially in the United States with distribution starting May 15, followed by a rollout in Canada. The introduction of vanilla flavor was hailed by The Coca-Cola Company as \"the greatest innovation since Diet Coke in 1983\". It also marked the 116th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Company. Later that year, it was introduced to the Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic markets of Europe. This was the first Coca-Cola variety introduced in Norway since Coca-Cola itself in 1937 and Coca-Cola Light in 1983. , Vanilla Coke was marketed in several European countries as well as Australia and New Zealand (in mid-to-late-2002). By late 2003, the company had marketed Vanilla Coke in over 30 countries around the globe. During the 2016 Summer Olympics the vanilla and cherry version was presented to selected markets in Brazil. Today, It can easily be distributed using a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, which injects vanilla syrup into Coca-Cola\n\nIts inaugural year in 2002 saw its best sales. It is estimated that the product was purchased by about 29% of all United States households that year. It still remains popular along with its flavored partner, Cherry Coca Cola. Doubt was cast over the future of Vanilla Coke and its splinter beverages when the company announced the 2004 sales figures: 35 million unit cases in North America compared to 90 million in 2002; Vanilla Diet Coke dropped from 23 million unit cases in its inaugural year (2003) to 13 million in 2004.\nIn November 2005, after slumping sales, The Coca-Cola Company announced that Vanilla Coke would be discontinued in North America and Great Britain by the end of the year. Coca-Cola introduced Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke in North America in January 2006. At the time, the company said Vanilla Coke and Diet Vanilla Coke would possibly be made available again in the future: \"We are exploring ways to bring them back at another time, but right now Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Black Cherry Vanilla Coke are what consumers are telling us they want.\" Vanilla Coke beverages were never discontinued in some markets, such as Australia, France, Russia, Malaysia, and Germany.\n\nFrom February 19, 2007, Vanilla Coke was re-introduced into New Zealand. The official re-introduction of Vanilla Coke in the US began May 25, 2007 at the World of Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. The Coca-Cola Company announced a partnership with Edy's Ice Cream to co-advertise with Coke on the launch, and featured a 10-ton Vanilla Coke float, which was certified by the Guinness World Records as the largest ice cream float in the world. A Coca-Cola Vanilla Zero has also been introduced. The re-released Coca-Cola Vanilla features a new packaging design. The advertising campaign for the revival used an instrumental cover of \"Welcome Back\". In 2007, Vanilla Coke was also introduced into China. It was also introduced in other countries in Europe and Asia. In June 2010, certain convenience stores in Ontario, Canada have re-introduced it by importing it from the neighbouring United States. Coca-Cola has made Coke Vanilla available in their Freestyle beverage machine in Canada; however, bottled and canned versions were not available until 2016.\nCoca-Cola initially stated that it had no plans to return Coca-Cola Vanilla to the United Kingdom despite high demand. Several enquiries were made throughout 2011 and 2012. Coca Cola then thought about returning Vanilla Coca-Cola to the United Kingdom sooner or later. It was reintroduced on March as part of Papa Johns promotion campaign before becoming available elsewhere.In April 2017 Vanilla Zero Sugar will be available in the UK. In May 2013, Coca-Cola Vanilla appeared in stores in Romania (imported), expanding to more stores through the year, due to demand, while there is still no official word from Coca-Cola. In July 2013, the drink re-appeared in stores around Belgium and the Netherlands as well. In October 2013, Coca-Cola Vanilla appeared in stores in Czech Republic and Slovakia. In February 2015, it appeared in some Tesco stores in Poland, where it is also available in Carrefour shops. It can also be purchased in many shops in Canada, and is widely available in Sweden, and also in some stores in Finland. In 2018, Coca-Cola confirmed the product's discontinuation in the UK in favour of Vanilla Zero Sugar.\n\nCoca-Cola Vanilla was introduced in Lithuania by the end of 2015 but only stayed in the shops for a few months (It was sold in selected stores of \"Maxima\") Possible reason for the drink being discontinued is that the sales were not good enough. It was distributed in 1L bottles only and price was 99 Euro cents (Regular 1L bottle was cheaper).\n\nVanilla Coke was packaged in standard bottles in accordance with appropriate Coca-Cola packaging. For a brief period of time in mid-2003, the bottles that Vanilla Coke came in, which had before said \"Vanilla Coke\", were changed simply to \"V\" (which matched Cherry Coke's new labeling showing a picture of a cherry).\n\nAs part of Coca-Cola's ongoing \"One Brand\" marketing campaign, a new U.S. packaging design for Coca-Cola Vanilla was introduced in January 2019. The new packaging follows the design principles already employed in the United States for Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and Coca-Cola Life. The word \"Coca-Cola\" is superimposed upon a red disc with a light beige drop (representing a drop of vanilla syrup) below the text. The background color of the can or bottle is light beige in color. The word \"Vanilla\" is placed above the red disc, similar to the \"Original Taste\" text currently used on cans and bottles of original Coca-Cola.\n\n\nIn late 2002, a sugar-free version, Diet Vanilla Coke, became available. In some countries, including Australia and New Zealand, a similar drink is marketed as \"Diet Coke with Vanilla\" and in others is known as Coca-Cola light Vanilla (or Vanilla Coke Light) In 2005, the sugar-free product in the United States and Canada became \"Diet Coke Vanilla,\" with more emphasis on the Diet Coke label. All varieties were discontinued in 2005 in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Both varieties are still available in Australia and Hong Kong, Coca-Cola Vanille (translation) is also available in France and Germany. A new Coke Vanilla Zero was introduced in 2007, along with regular Vanilla. Only these two are available in the United States. The company has not announced any plan to resume production of Diet Vanilla Coke. Diet Vanilla Coke is, however, available using a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. Coca Cola Zero sugar Vanilla will be available in the UK from April 2017 in 1.75L bottles, 330ml cans, 500ml bottles and multipack of cans.\n\n"}
{"id": "298210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298210", "title": "Chili con carne", "text": "Chili con carne\n\nChili con carne or chilli con carne (), meaning \"chili with meat\" and sometimes known as simply \"chili\" or \"chilli\", is a spicy stew containing chili peppers, meat (usually beef), and often tomatoes and beans. Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. Geographic and personal tastes involve different types of meat and ingredients. Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word \"chili\" applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili con carne is a frequent dish for cook-offs and is used as an ingredient in other dishes.\n\nIn Spanish, the word \"chile\" from the Nahuatl \"chīlli\" refers to a \"chili pepper\", and \"carne\" is Spanish for \"meat\".\n\nA recipe dating back to the 1850s describes dried beef, suet, dried chili peppers and salt, which were pounded together, formed into bricks and left to dry, which could then be boiled in pots on the trail.\n\nChili originated from what is now northern Mexico and southern Texas. Unlike some other Texas foods, such as barbecued brisket, chili largely originated with working-class Tejana and Mexican women. The chili queens of San Antonio, Texas were particularly famous in previous decades for selling their inexpensive chili-flavored beef stew in their casual \"chili joints\".\n\nThe San Antonio Chili Stand, in operation at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, helped popularize chili by giving many Americans their first taste of it. San Antonio was a tourist destination and helped Texas-style chili con carne spread throughout the South and West. Chili con carne is the official dish of the U.S. state of Texas as designated by the House Concurrent Resolution Number 18 of the 65th Texas Legislature during its regular session in 1977.\n\nBefore World War II, hundreds of small, family-run chili parlors (also known as \"chili joints\") could be found throughout Texas and other states, particularly those in which émigré Texans had made new homes. Each establishment usually had a claim to some kind of secret recipe.\n\nBy 1904, chili parlors were opening outside of Texas, in part due to the availability of commercial versions of chili powder, first manufactured in Texas in the late 19th century. After working at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Charles Taylor opened a chili parlor in Carlinville, Illinois, serving \"Mexican Chili\". Varallo's, the oldest restaurant in Tennessee, opened as a chili parlor in 1907, competing with other chili parlors that had opened in Nashville during the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, chains of diner-style chili parlors began opening in the Midwest.\n\nCincinnati chili, a dish developed by Greek immigrants deriving from their own culinary traditions, arguably represents the most vibrant continuation of the chili parlor tradition, with dozens of restaurants offering this style throughout the Cincinnati area. It can be traced back to at least 1922, when the original Empress Chili location opened.\n\nIn Green Bay, Wisconsin, the chili parlor Chili John's has existed since 1913. As with Cincinnati chili, it is most commonly served over spaghetti with oyster crackers, but the recipe is less sweet with a higher proportion of fat. The original proprietor's son opened a second location in Burbank, California in 1946, which is also still in existence.\n\nUntil the late 2000s, a chili parlor dating to 1904, O.T. Hodge, continued to operate in St. Louis. It featured a chili-topped dish called a slinger: two cheeseburger patties, hash browns, and two eggs, and smothered in chili. As of 2014 no O.T. Hodge-branded locations remain.\n\nBeans, a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, have been associated with chili as far back as the early 20th century. The question of whether beans belong in chili has long been a matter of contention among chili cooks. While it is generally accepted that the earliest chilis did not include beans, proponents of their inclusion contend that chili with beans has a long enough history so as to not be considered unauthentic. The Chili Appreciation Society International specified in 1999 that, among other things, cooks are forbidden to include beans in the preparation of chili for official competition—nor are they allowed to marinate any meats. Small red or pink common beans are commonly used for chili, as are black-eyed peas, kidney beans, pinto beans, great northern beans, or navy beans.\nChili may or may not contain beans and may even be made without any other vegetables whatsoever besides chili peppers.\n\nMost commercially prepared canned chili includes beans. Commercial chili prepared without beans is usually called \"\"chili no beans\"\" in the United States. Some U.S. manufacturers, notably Bush Brothers and Company and Eden Organic, also sell canned precooked beans (without meat) that are labeled \"chili beans\"; these beans are intended for consumers to add to a chili recipe and are often sold with spices added.\n\nTomatoes are another ingredient on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, north Texas newspaperman and inventor of \"Two-Alarm Chili\" (which he later marketed as a \"kit\" of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili — one 15-ounce can per three pounds of meat. He also believed that chili should never be eaten freshly cooked but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler's chili \"was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession.\"\n\nVegetarian chili (also known as chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) acquired wide popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, mushrooms, or beets.\n\nChili verde (green chili) is a moderately to extremely spicy New Mexican cuisine stew or sauce usually made from chunks of pork that have been slow-cooked in chicken broth, garlic, \"tomatillos\", and roasted green chilis. The spiciness of the chili is adjusted with poblano, jalapeño, serrano, and occasionally habanero peppers. Chili verde is a common filling for the Mission burrito.\n\nWhite chili is made using white beans and turkey meat or chicken breast instead of a tomato-based sauce and red meat (beef). The resulting dish appears white when cooked.\n\nThe dish may be served with toppings or accompaniments; grated cheese, diced onions, and sour cream are common toppings, as are saltine crackers, tortilla chips or corn chips, cornbread, rolled-up corn or flour tortillas, and pork tamales. Chili can also be served over rice or pasta such as spaghetti.\n\nWillie Gebhardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas, and later of San Antonio, produced the first canned chili in 1908. Rancher Lyman Davis near Corsicana, Texas, developed Wolf Brand Chili in 1895. He owned a meat market and was a particular fan of Texas-style chili. In the 1880s, in partnership with an experienced range cook, he began producing heavily spiced chili based on chunks of lean beef and rendered beef suet, which he sold by the pot to local cafés.\n\nIn 1921, Davis began canning his product, naming it for his pet wolf, Kaiser Bill. Wolf Brand canned chili was a favorite of Will Rogers, who always took along a case when traveling and performing in other regions of the world. Ernest Tubb, the country singer, was such a fan that one Texas hotel maintained a supply of Wolf Brand for his visits. Both the Gebhardt and Wolf brands are now owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. Another major maker of canned chili, Hormel, sells chili available with or without beans, made with turkey or in vegetarian varieties, under their own name and other brands like Stagg.\n\nAnother method of marketing commercial chili in the days before widespread home refrigerators was \"brick chili\". It was produced by pressing out nearly all of the moisture, leaving a solid substance roughly the size and shape of a half-brick. Wolf Brand was originally sold in this form. Commonly available in small towns and rural areas of the American Southwest in the first three-quarters of the 20th century, brick chili has largely been surpassed by canned chili, but can still be found in some stores.\n\nHome cooks may also purchase seasoning mixes for chili, including packets of dry ingredients such as chili powder, masa flour, salt, and cayenne pepper, to flavor meat and other ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "298222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298222", "title": "Gefilte fish", "text": "Gefilte fish\n\nGefilte fish (; from , \"stuffed fish\") is a dish made from a poached mixture of ground deboned fish, such as carp, whitefish, or pike. It is traditionally served as an appetizer by Ashkenazi Jewish households. Although it historically consisted of a minced-fish forcemeat stuffed inside the fish skin, by the 16th century, cooks had started omitting this step and the seasoned fish is most commonly formed into patties similar to \"quenelles\" or fish balls. These are popular on Shabbat and Jewish Holidays such as Passover, although they may be consumed throughout the year.\n\nIn Poland, gefilte fish, referred to as \"karp po żydowsku\" (\"carp Jewish-style\"), is a traditional dish in some Polish homes (more commonly in the northern regions near the Baltic Sea), served on Christmas Eve (for Twelve-dish supper) and on Holy Saturday.\n\nTraditionally, carp, pike, mullet, or whitefish were used to make gefilte fish, but more recently other fish with white flesh such as Nile perch have been used, and there is a pink variation using salmon. There are even vegetarian variations. In the Middle Ages, the minced-fish forcemeat was stuffed inside the intact fish skin, but by the 16th century Ashkenazic cooks had started omitting this labor intensive step. In its modern form, the seasoned fish is most commonly formed into patties similar to quenelles or fish balls.\n\nFish fillets are ground with eggs and sometimes onion, bread or matza crumbs, and spices or salt, carrot and potato to produce a paste or dough which is then boiled in fish stock.\n\nTraditionally gefilte fish is cooked in large logs and then sliced for serving but sometimes it is cooked and served as egg-shaped patties, like quenelles. In the United Kingdom, gefilte fish is commonly fried. It is usually served cold or at room temperature. Each piece may be topped with a slice of carrot, and/or very often with a horseradish mixture called \"khreyn\" on the side. Gefilte fish is not served with carrot when one serves a spicy type of gefilte fish cooked with ground black pepper instead of carrot and potato.\n\nDue to the previous general poverty of the Jewish population in Europe and especially Eastern Europe, where the dish originated, an economical recipe for the above also may have included finely ground and soaked matza meal or bread crumbs. This form of preparation eliminated the need for picking out fish bones at the table, and \"stretched\" the (expensive) fish further, so that even poor, large families could enjoy fish on Shabbat. Not only is picking bones religiously prohibited on the Sabbath, but many of the common fish used in the dish, such as carp, are exceptionally bony and difficult to eat in whole form. The fish bones can then be used in making fish stock.\n\nIn Polish Catholic homes, gefilte fish () is a traditional dish to be eaten on Christmas Eve and Holy Saturday, as these are traditionally meatless feasts. This follows a pattern in which a number of Jewish dishes were also eaten on Catholic religious days in Poland.\n\nGefilte fish may be slightly sweet or savory. Preparation of gefilte fish with sugar or black pepper is considered an indicator of whether a Jewish community was Galitzianer (with sugar) or Litvak (with pepper); the boundary separating northern from southern East Yiddish has thus been dubbed \"the Gefilte Fish Line\".\n\nThe post-WWII method of making gefilte fish commercially takes the form of patties or balls, or utilizes a wax paper casing around a \"log\" of ground fish, which is then poached or baked. This product is sold in cans and glass jars, and packed in jelly made from fish broth. The sodium content is relatively high at 220–290 mg/serving. Low-salt, low-carbohydrate, low-cholesterol, and sugar-free varieties are available. The patent () for this jelly, which allowed mass-market distribution of gefilte fish, was granted on October 29, 1963, to Monroe Nash and Erich G. Freudenstein. Gefilte fish is also sold frozen in \"logs\".\n\nAmong religiously observant Jews, gefilte fish has become a traditional Shabbat food to avoid \"borer\", which is one of the 39 activities prohibited on Shabbat outlined in the Shulchan Aruch. \"Borer\", literally \"selection/choosing\", would occur when one picks the bones out of the fish, taking \"the chaff from within the food\".\n\nA less common belief is that fish are not subject to \"ayin hara\" (\"evil eye\") because they are submerged while alive, so that a dish prepared from several fish varieties brings good luck.\n\n"}
{"id": "298554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298554", "title": "Hacienda", "text": "Hacienda\n\nA hacienda ( or ; or ), in the colonies of the Spanish Empire, is an estate (or finca), similar in form to a Roman villa. Some haciendas were plantations, mines or factories. Many haciendas combined these activities. The word is derived from the Spanish word \"hacer\" or \"haciendo\", which means: to make or be making, respectively; and were largely business enterprises consisting of various money making ventures including raising farm animals and maintaining orchards.\n\nThe term \"hacienda\" is imprecise, but usually refers to landed estates of significant size. Smaller holdings were termed estancias or ranchos that were owned almost exclusively by Spaniards and criollos and in rare cases by mixed-race individuals. In Argentina, the term estancia is used for large estates that in Mexico would be termed haciendas. In recent decades, the term has been used in the United States to refer to an architectural style associated with the earlier estate manor houses.\n\nThe hacienda system of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, New Granada, and Peru was a system of large land holdings. A similar system existed on a smaller scale in the Philippines and Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, haciendas were larger than estancias, ordinarily grew either sugar cane, coffee, or cotton, and exported their crops outside Puerto Rico.\n\nHaciendas were developed as profit-making, economic enterprises linked to regional or international markets. Although the hacienda is not directly linked to the early grants of indigenous American labor, the encomienda, many Spanish holders of encomiendas did acquire land or develop enterprises where they had access to that forced labor. Even though the private landed estates that constituted most haciendas did not have a direct tie to the encomienda, they are nonetheless linked. Encomenderos were in a position to retain their prominence economically via the hacienda. Since the encomienda was a grant from the crown, holders were dependent on the crown for its continuation. As the crown moved to eliminate the encomienda with its labor supply, Spaniards consolidated private landholdings and recruited free labor on a permanent or casual basis. The long term trend then was the creation of the hacienda as secure private property, which survived the colonial period and into the 20th century. Estates were integrated into a market-based economy aimed at the Hispanic sector and cultivated crops such as sugar, wheat, fruits and vegetables and produced animal products such as meat, wool, leather, and tallow.\n\nHaciendas originated in Spanish land grants, made to many \"conquistadors\" and crown officials, but many ordinary Spaniards could also petition for land grants from the crown. The system is considered to have started in present-day Mexico, when the Spanish Crown granted to Hernán Cortés the title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca in 1529. It gave him a tract of land that included all of the present state of Morelos. Cortés was also granted encomiendas, that gave him access to a vast pool of indigenous labor.\n\nIn Spanish America, the owner of an hacienda was called the \"hacendado\" or \"patrón\". Most owners of large and profitable haciendas preferred to live in Spanish cities, often near the hacienda, but in Mexico, the richest owners lived in Mexico City, visiting their haciendas at intervals. Onsite management of the rural estates was by a paid administrator or manager, which was similar to the arrangement with the encomienda. Administrators were often hired for a fixed term of employment, receiving a salary and at times some share of the profits of the estate. Some administrators also acquired landholdings themselves in the area of the estate they were managing.\n\nThe work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located. In central Mexico near indigenous communities and growing crops to supply urban markets, there was often a small, permanent workforce resident on the hacienda. Labor could be recruited from nearby indigenous communities on an as-needed basis, such as planting and harvest time. The permanent and temporary hacienda employees worked land that belonged to the \"patrón\" and under the supervision of local labor bosses. In some places small scale cultivators or \"campesinos\" worked small holdings belonging to the hacendado, and owed a portion of their crops to him. In a number of places, the economy of the 18th century was largely a barter system, with little specie circulated on the \"hacienda\".\n\nStock raising was central to ranching haciendas, the largest of which were in areas without dense indigenous populations, such as northern Mexico, but as indigenous populations declined in central areas, more land became available for grazing. Livestock were animals originally imported from Spain, including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were part of the Columbian Exchange and produced significant ecological changes. Sheep in particular had a devastating impact on the environment due to overgrazing. Mounted ranch hands variously called \"vaqueros\" and \"gauchos\" (in the Southern Cone), among other terms worked for pastoral haciendas.\n\nWhere the hacienda included working mines, as in Mexico, the \"patrón\" might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable Jesuit \"hacienda\" Santa Lucía, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its labor force, its systems of land tenure and its relationship to larger Hispanic society in Mexico.\nThe Catholic Church and orders, especially the Jesuits, acquired vast \"hacienda\" holdings or preferentially loaned money to the hacendados. As the hacienda owners' mortgage holders, the Church's interests were connected with the landholding class. In the history of Mexico and other Latin American countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them.\n\nHaciendas in the Caribbean were developed primarily as sugar plantations, dependent on the labor of African slaves imported to the region. were staffed by slaves brought from Africa. In Puerto Rico, this system ended with the abolition of slavery on 22 March 1873.\n\nIn South America, the \"hacienda\" remained after the collapse of the colonial system in the early 19th century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as Dominican Republic, with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small subsistence farmers' holdings, an agrarian revolution. In Argentina and elsewhere, a second, international, money-based economy developed independently of the \"haciendas\", which sank into rural poverty.\nIn most of Latin America, the old holdings remained. In Mexico, the \"haciendas\" were abolished by law in 1917 during the revolution, but remnants of the system affect Mexico today. In rural areas, the wealthiest people typically affect the style of the old hacendados even though their wealth these days derives from more capitalistic enterprises.\n\nIn Bolivia, haciendas were more prevalent until the 1952 Revolution of Víctor Paz Estenssoro. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the Agrarian Reform. Likewise, Peru had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of Juan Velasco Alvarado, who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants.\n\nIn the Philippines, the hacienda system and lifestyles were influenced by the Spanish colonization that occurred via Mexico for more than 300 years. Attempts to break up the hacienda system in the Philippines through land reform laws during the second half of the 1900s have not been successful. There were protests related to the Hacienda Luisita.\n\nHaciendas in Puerto Rico developed during the time of Spanish colonization. An example of these was the 1833 Hacienda Buena Vista, which dealt primarily with the cultivation, packaging, and exportation of coffee. Today, Hacienda Buena Vista, which is listed in the United States National Register of Historic Places, is operated as a museum.\n\nThe 1861 Hacienda Mercedita was a sugar plantation that once produced, packaged and sold sugar in the \"Snow White\" brand name. In the late 19th century, Mercedita became the site of production of Don Q rum. Its profitable rum business is today called Destilería Serrallés. The last of such haciendas decayed considerably starting in the 1950s, with the industrialization of Puerto Rico via \"Operation Bootstrap\". At the turn of the 20th century, most coffee haciendas had disappeared.\n\nThe sugar-based haciendas changed into \"centrales azucarelas.\" Yet by the 1990s, and despite significant government fiscal support, the last 13 Puerto Rican \"centrales azucares\" were forced to shut down. This marked the end of haciendas operating in Puerto Rico. In 2000, the last two sugar mills closed, after having operated for nearly 100 years.\n\nAn \"\"estancia\"\" was a similar type of food farm. An \"estancia\" differed from an hacienda in terms of crop types handled, target market, machinery used, and size. An estancia, during Spanish colonial times in Puerto Rico (1508-1898), was a plot of land used for cultivating \"\"frutos menores\"\" (minor crops). That is, the crops in such \"estancia\" farms were produced in relatively small quantities and thus were meant, not for wholesale or exporting, but for sale and consumption locally, where produced and its adjacent towns. Haciendas, unlike estancias, were equipped with industrial machinery used for processing its crops into derivatives such as juices, marmalades, flours, etc., for wholesale and exporting. Some \"\"frutos menores\"\" grown in estancias were rice, corn, beans, batatas, ñames, yautías, and pumpkins; among fruits were plantains, bananas, oranges, avocados, and grapefruits. Most haciendas in Puerto Rico produced sugar, coffee, and tobacco, which were the crops for exporting. Some estancias were larger than some haciendas, but generally this was the exception and not the norm. \n\nIn the present era, the ' is the government department in Spain that deals with finance and taxation, as in Mexico ', and which is equivalent to the Department of the Treasury in the United States or HM Treasury in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n"}

It was introduced in the Greater Pittsburgh area, United States, in 1967 and nationwide in 1968. It is one of the company's flagship products.\n\nThe Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, an early Ray Kroc franchisee, who was operating several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. It was invented in the kitchen of Delligatti's first McDonald's franchise, located on McKnight Road in suburban Ross Township.\nThe Big Mac had two previous names, both of which failed in the marketplace: the Aristocrat, which consumers found difficult to pronounce and understand, and Blue Ribbon Burger. The third name, Big Mac, was created by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old advertising secretary who worked at McDonald’s corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois.\nThe Big Mac debuted at Delligatti's Uniontown, Pennsylvania restaurant in 1967, selling for 45 cents. It was designed to compete with Big Boy Restaurants' Big Boy hamburger; Eat'n Park was the Pittsburgh area's Big Boy franchisee at the time. The Big Mac proved popular and it was added to the menu of all U.S. restaurants in 1968.\n\nThe Big Mac consists of two 1.6 oz (45.4 g) beef patties, \"special sauce\" (a variant of Thousand Island dressing), iceberg lettuce, American cheese, pickles, and onions, served in a three-part sesame seed bun. On October 1, 2018, McDonalds announced that it would remove all artificial preservatives, flavors, and coloring from the Big Mac.\n\nThe Big Mac is known worldwide and is often used as a symbol of American capitalism and decadence. \"The Economist\" has used it as a reference point for comparing the cost of living in different countries – the Big Mac Index – as it is so widely available and is comparable across markets. This index is sometimes referred to as \"Burgernomics\".\n\nThe name was popularized by a 1974 advertising campaign featuring a list of the ingredients in a Big Mac: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun.\"\n\nBig Mac Sauce is delivered to McDonald's restaurants in sealed canisters designed by Sealright, from which it is meant to be directly dispensed using a special calibrated \"sauce gun\" that dispenses a specified amount of the sauce for each pull of the trigger. Its design is similar to a caulking gun.\n\nIn 2012, McDonald's admitted that \"the special sauce ingredients were not really a secret\" because the recipe had been available online \"for years\". It consists of store-bought mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard whisked together with vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika.\n\nIn 2018, McDonald's revamped the special sauce by removing potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and calcium disodium EDTA. \n\nThe Big Mac, along with many other McDonald's products, was first served in a collapsible cardboard container that was changed to a \"clamshell\" style styrofoam container in the late 1970s. Styrofoam containers were phased out beginning in 1990, due to environmental concerns. The product is now sold in another collapsible cardboard box.\n\nThe earliest instances of McDonald's using advertising for the burger were mainly print ads, and a TV ad in which Hoyt Axton sings \"The Ballad of Big Mac\" which aired in 1969.\n\nThe \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun\" concept for the jingle was created by Keith Reinhard, Chairman Emeritus of DDB Worldwide, and his creative group at Needham Harper and Steers. Originally, the ingredients appeared as a one-word heading for a McDonald's ad developed for college newspapers. The words were then set to music created by Mark Vieha, who performed the original jingle. The first run of commercials ran only a year and a half, going off the air in 1976, but its popularity remained beyond its TV life. Subsequent to the jingle, McDonald's followed up with a promotion based on its customers spontaneously having a \"Big Mac Attack\".\n\nIn the United States during the original campaign many franchises ran promotions that awarded a free burger to customers who could recite the slogan within a specified time (usually two or three seconds). One example of its success was that the McDonald's operators in New York City ran out of Big Mac buns. McDonald's Australia emulated this promotion in the mid-1980s, and some Brazilian McDonald's around the same time (only offering a free glass of Coca-Cola instead), in the Portuguese-language version, which is \"Dois hambúrgueres, alface, queijo, molho especial, cebola e picles num pão com gergelim\".\n\nIn 2003, McDonald's revived the phrase. In an English-language ad from McDonald's international \"i'm lovin' it\" campaign, a rapper rapidly spouts off the trademark in the background music. Also in 2003, American Greetings and Carlton Cards released a Christmas ornament of a Big Mac, on which the slogan was both printed and played aloud by pulling on a string. Roy Bergold, National Advertising Manager at McDonald's, has a big hand in championing the original campaign and helping to bring it back.\n\nIn 2008 McDonald's Malaysia revived the phrase. The revival includes the original prize of a free Big Mac if the customer is able to recite the phrase in under four seconds. It was released in May, along with the promotional \"Mega Mac\", which has four beef patties instead of two.\n\nIn the early 1980s, as a promotion, McDonald's staged an in-house rivalry between their two most popular products. Consumers were invited to decide \"Which one will be number one? Chicken McNuggets or Big Mac sandwiches?\" For each of either item that a customer bought, they received another of the same at half price. Later in the ad campaign, the second was offered for free. It was eventually announced that the Big Mac was \"number one\".\n\nAds in the 1980s and early 1990s featured the character Mac Tonight and a parody of the song Mack the Knife. The character was pulled after settlement of a lawsuit by the estate of late singer Bobby Darin, whose famous 1958 recording popularized the song.\n\nIn 2005, McDonald's began offering product placement rewards to hip hop artists who namechecked the Big Mac in their music, giving US$5 to the artist for every time a song mentioning the hamburger was played on the radio. This offer quickly spawned a satirical reference from hip hop artist Mad Skillz, who references the marketing ploy in his track \"2005 Wrap Up\" by stating \"And I'm beefin' wit' Mickey D's man, y'all dead wrong, Talkin' 'bout payin' rappers to mention Big Macs in their song, We do rap from the heart, y'all better have some respect, Alright, Big Mac! Big Mac! Big Mac! Now where's my check?\"\n\nMcDonald's sued the Irish fast food chain Supermac's for trademark infringement and claimed the name would confuse consumers in European markets. On 11 January 2019, the EUIPO ruled in Supermac's favor in what has been called a \"David vs. Goliath\" victory. McDonald's submitted a copy of the Wikipedia article about the Big Mac as part of its evidence, but according to the \"Irish Independent\", the court found the Wikipedia page was not acceptable as \"independent evidence\".\n\n\n\nIn addition to the McDonald's signature hamburger, Big Mac was the name of a character, Officer Big Mac, in McDonaldland, the fictional world created as an advertising campaign for McDonald's. Officer Big Mac was similar to Mayor McCheese, except he was the chief of police, wearing a constable uniform and sporting a large Big Mac for a head.\n\nOn August 22, 2007, McDonald's opened the Big Mac Museum in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania to celebrate the Big Mac’s 40th anniversary. The museum features the world's largest Big Mac statue (measuring 14 feet high and 12 feet wide) and has hundreds of historic artifacts and exhibits that celebrate the Big Mac.\n\nSome Uniontown residents were unhappy with the selected location; a McDonald’s spokesperson said that the decision was based on ease of highway access.\n\nThe Big Mac is a geographically localized product. In the United States, the Big Mac has 550 kcal (2,300 kJ), 29 grams of fat and 25 grams of protein. In Australasia, the burger is slightly smaller with 493 kcal (2,060 kJ) and 26.9 grams of fat, but similar amounts of protein with 25.2 grams, while the Japanese burger tops out the scales at 557 kcal and 30.5 grams of fat. Several Mcdonald's subsidiaries adapt the standard features of the Big Mac (from the USA) to regional requirements.\n\n\nSimilar products by other restaurant chains:\n\n"}
{"id": "299848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299848", "title": "Baguette", "text": "Baguette\n\nA baguette (; ) is a long, thin loaf of French bread that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law). It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.\n\nA baguette has a diameter of about 5 or 6 cm (2-2⅓ in) and a usual length of about , although a baguette can be up to 1 m (39 in) long.\n\nBaguettes are a type of bread. No academic study has been written on the history of the baguette itself, as a type of bread. Thus, much of its history is speculative; however, some facts can be established. Among these are the increased popularity of long, stick-like breads in France starting in the 18th century, the shift among French bakers to using \"\"gruau\"\", a highly refined Hungarian high-milled flour in the early 19th century, the introduction of Viennese steam oven baking to Paris in 1839 by August Zang, and the subsequent introduction of the Austrian compact yeast to Paris in 1867 at the Universal Exposition. Finally, there is the first use of the word \"baguette\" in print, to define a particular type of bread, in a set of laws enacted by the Prefecture of the Seine Department in August 1920: \"The baguette, having a minimum weight of 80 g and a maximum length of 40 cm, may not be sold for a price higher than 0.65 francs apiece\" While no one of these events is in itself definable as \"the invention of the baguette\", each of them, the shape, the flour, the fermentation, and the steam baking, contribute to what is today recognized as a \"baguette\".\n\nTo summarize this history, the historian and author Jim Chevallier states that \"it seems most accurate to say that the bread which became known as the baguette first appeared in its most primitive form in the eighteenth century, then experienced a number of refinements and variations before being (officially) given that name in 1920.\"\n\nAlthough the word \"baguette\" was not used to refer to a type of bread until 1920, the word itself simply means \"wand\", \"baton\" or \"stick\", as in \"baguette magique\" (magic wand), \"baguettes chinoises\" (chopsticks), or \"baguette de direction\" (conductor's baton).\n\nThough the baguette today is often considered one of the symbols of French culture viewed from abroad, the association of France with long loaves predates any mention of it. Long, wide, loaves had been made since the time of King Louis XIV, long thin ones since the mid-18th century, and by the 19th century, some were far longer than what is today sold as a baguette: \"... loaves of bread six feet long that look like crowbars!\" (Boswell, 1862); \"Housemaids were hurrying homewards with their purchases for various Gallic breakfasts, and the long sticks of bread, a yard or two in length, carried under their arms, made an odd impression upon me.\" (Elson, 1898)\n\nA less direct link can be made, however, with deck ovens, or steam ovens. Deck/steam ovens are a combination of a gas-fired traditional oven and a brick oven, a thick \"deck\" of stone or firebrick heated by natural gas instead of wood. The first steam oven was brought (in the early 19th century) to Paris by the Austrian officer August Zang, who also introduced Vienna bread (\"pain viennois\") and the croissant, and whom some French sources thus credit with originating the baguette.\n\nDeck ovens use steam injection, through various methods, to create the proper baguette. The oven is typically heated to well over . The steam allows the crust to expand before setting, thus creating a lighter, airier loaf. It also melts the dextrose on the bread's surface, giving a slightly glazed effect.\n\nAn unsourced article in \"The Economist\" states that in October 1920 a law prevented bakers from working before 4 am, making it impossible to make traditional round loaves in time for customers' breakfasts. Switching from the round loaf to the previously less-common, slender shape of the \"baguette\", the article claims, solved the problem, because it could be prepared and baked much more quickly.\n\nThe law in question appears to be one from March 1919, though some say it took effect in October 1920:\nIt is forbidden to employ workers at bread and pastry making between ten in the evening and four in the morning.\n\nThe rest of the account remains to be verified, but the use of the word for a long thin bread does appear to be a 20th-century innovation.\n\nThe \"baguette de tradition française\" is made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and common salt. It may contain up to 2% broad bean flour, up to 0.5% soya flour, and up to 0.3% wheat malt flour.\n\nWhile a regular baguette is made with a direct addition of baker's yeast, artisan-style loaves are not unusually made with a preferment (\"poolish\") to increase flavor complexity and other characteristics, as well as the addition of whole-wheat flour, or other grains such as rye.\n\nBaguettes are closely connected to France, though they are made around the world. In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example, a short, almost rugby ball-shaped loaf is a \"bâtard\" (literally, bastard), or a \"torpedo loaf\" in English; its origin is variously explained, but undocumented. Another tubular shaped loaf is known as a \"flûte\", also known in the United States as a \"parisienne\". Flûtes closely resemble baguettes and weigh more or less than these, depending on the region. A thinner loaf is called a \"ficelle\" (string). A short baguette is sometimes known as a \"baton\" (stick), or even referred to using the English translation \"French stick\". None of these are officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French breads are also made in forms such as a \"miche\", which is a large pan loaf, and a \"boule\", literally ball in French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as \"demi-baguettes\" or \"tiers\".\nIn France a baguette weighs around 250 grams (8.75 ounces), a batard 500 grams (17.5 ounces) and a ficelle 100 grams (3.5 ounces) (No legal text actually establishes any of these weights, which can vary in different places).\nBaguettes, either relatively short single-serving size or cut from a longer loaf, are very often used for sandwiches, usually of the submarine sandwich type, but also a Panini. They are often sliced and served with pâté or cheese. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette are spread with butter and jam and dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate. \n\nBaguettes are generally made as partially free-form loaves, with the loaf formed with a series of folding and rolling motions, raised in cloth-lined baskets or in rows on a flour-impregnated towel, called a couche, and baked either directly on the hearth of a deck oven or in special perforated pans designed to hold the shape of the baguette while allowing heat through the perforations. American-style \"French bread\" is generally much fatter and is not baked in deck ovens, but in convection ovens.\n\nOutside France, baguettes are also made with other doughs. For example, the Vietnamese \"bánh mì\" uses a high proportion of rice flour, while many North American bakeries make whole wheat, multigrain, and sourdough baguettes alongside French-style loaves. In addition, even classical French-style recipes vary from place to place, with some recipes adding small amounts of milk, butter, sugar, or malt extract, depending on the desired flavour and properties in the final loaf.\n\n\n"}

Its consistency is similar to that of molasses. The viscosity arises from the multiple hydrogen bonds between the dissolved sugar, which has many hydroxyl (OH) groups, anSyrup can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane \n\nSyrups can be made by dissolving sugar in water or by reducing naturally sweet juices such as cane juice, sorghum juice, maple sap or agave nectar. Corn syrup is made from corn starch using an enzymatic process that converts it to sugars.\n\nThere are a range of syrups used in food production, including:\n\nA variety of beverages call for sweetening to offset the tartness of some juices used in the drink recipes. Granulated sugar does not dissolve easily in cold drinks or ethyl alcohol. Since the following syrups are liquids, they are easily mixed with other liquids in mixed drinks, making them superior alternatives to granulated sugar.\n\nSimple syrup is a basic sugar-and-water syrup used by bartenders as a sweetener to make cocktails. Simple syrup is made by stirring granulated sugar into hot water in a saucepan until the sugar is dissolved and then cooling the solution. The ratio of sugar to water is 1:1 by volume for normal simple syrup, but can get up to 2:1 for rich simple syrup. For pure sucrose the saturation limit is about 5:4 by volume. Syrup can be used as a sweetener.\n\nCombining Demerara sugar, a type of natural brown sugar, with water produces Demerara syrup. Sugar substitutes such as honey or agave nectar can also be used to make syrups.\n\nFlavoured syrups are made by infusing simple syrups with flavouring agents during the cooking process. A wide variety of flavouring agents can be used, often in combination with each other, such as herbs (rosemary), spices (chipotle chilis; cardamom), or aromatics (orange peel; lemongrass; ginger). For instance, \"syrupus aromaticus\" is prepared by adding certain quantities of orange flavouring and cinnamon water to simple syrup. This type of syrup is commonly used at coffee bars, especially in the United States, to make flavoured drinks. Infused simple syrups can be used to create desserts, or, to add sweetness and depth of flavour to cocktails.\n\nGomme syrup (or gum syrup; \"gomme\" is French for \"gum\") is an ingredient commonly used in mixed drinks. It is also commonly used as a sweetener for iced coffee in Japan. Like bar syrups, it is a 2:1 sugar and water mixture, but has an added ingredient of gum arabic. Gomme syrup is made with the highest ratio of sugar to water possible, while the gum arabic prevents the sugar from crystallizing and adds a smooth texture.\n\n"}
{"id": "301873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301873", "title": "Scrapple", "text": "Scrapple\n\nScrapple, also known by the Pennsylvania Dutch name \"Pannhaas\" or \"pan rabbit\", is traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices. The mush is formed into a semi-solid congealed loaf, and slices of the scrapple are then pan-fried before serving. Scraps of meat left over from butchering, not used or sold elsewhere, were made into scrapple to avoid waste. Scrapple is best known as an American food of the Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). Scrapple and \"panhaas\" are commonly considered an ethnic food of the Pennsylvania Dutch, including the Mennonites and Amish. Scrapple is found in supermarkets throughout the region in both fresh and frozen refrigerated cases.\n\nScrapple is typically made of hog offal, such as the head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned to the pot and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very much a matter of the region and the cook's taste.\n\nA few manufacturers have introduced beef and turkey varieties and color the loaf to retain the traditional coloration derived from the original pork liver base.\n\nDue to its composition, it is often jokingly described as being made from \"everything but the oink\".\n\nScrapple is typically cut into quarter-inch to three-quarter-inch slices and pan-fried until brown to form a crust. It is sometimes first coated with flour. It may be fried in butter or oil and is sometimes deep-fried. Scrapple can also be broiled; this is a good cooking method for those who like their scrapple crisp.\n\nScrapple is usually eaten as a breakfast side dish. It can be served plain or with either sweet or savory condiments: apple butter, ketchup, jelly, maple syrup, honey, or mustard.\n\nThe roots of the culinary traditions that led to the development of scrapple in America have been traced back to pre-Roman Europe. The more immediate culinary ancestor of scrapple was the Low German dish called \"\", which was adapted to make use of locally available ingredients, and it is still called \"Pannhaas,\" \"panhoss,\" \"ponhoss,\" or \"pannhas\" in parts of Pennsylvania. The first recipes were created by German colonists who settled near Philadelphia and Chester County, Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, scrapple is strongly associated with areas surrounding Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C.; Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Southern New York, and the Delmarva Peninsula. Its popularity on the Delmarva Peninsula is celebrated the second weekend of October during the annual \"Apple Scrapple Festival\" in Bridgeville, Delaware.\n\nThe two largest brands of scrapple in Philadelphia are Habbersett and Rapa controlling approximately half and a quarter of the market respectively.\n\nFoods\n\n"}
{"id": "301932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301932", "title": "Kraft Dinner", "text": "Kraft Dinner\n\nThe product known as: Kraft Dinner or KD in Canada; Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Dinner or Kraft Mac & Cheese in the United States and Australia; and Macaroni Cheese or Cheesey Pasta in the United Kingdom, is a nonperishable, packaged dry macaroni and cheese product, traditionally cardboard-boxed with dried macaroni pasta and a packet of processed cheese powder. It was first introduced under the \"Kraft Dinner\" name in both Canada and the U.S. in 1937.\n\nThe product has developed into many more flavors and several other formulations, including Kraft Easy Mac Cups, a product later renamed \"Macaroni & Cheese Dinner Cups\", a single-serving product designed specifically for microwave ovens.\n\nThe product's innovation was to conveniently combine nonperishable dried macaroni noodles with a processed cheese powder into a single purchasable item. The final dish can be prepared by simply cooking the pasta and adding the cheese powder along with additional perishable and/or refrigerated ingredients like butter (or margarine) and cow's milk.\n\nThe prerequisite to a shelf-stable packaged macaroni and cheese product was the invention of \"processed\" cheeses, where emulsifying salts help stabilize the product, giving it a longer life. Although James Lewis Kraft, originally of Fort Erie, Ontario, but living in Chicago, did not invent processed cheese, he won a patent for one processing method in 1916 and began to build his cheese business.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, a St. Louis, Missouri salesman had the idea to sell macaroni pasta and cheese together as a package, so he began attaching grated cheese to boxes of pasta with a rubber band. In 1937, Kraft introduced the product in the U.S. and Canada. The timing of the product's launch had much to do with its success: during World War II, rationing of milk and dairy products, an increased reliance on meatless meals, and more women working outside the home, created a nearly captive market for the product, which was considered a hearty meal for families. Its shelf life of ten months was attractive at a time when many Canadian homes did not have refrigerators. Also, consumers could receive, for one food ration stamp, two boxes. The original box was primarily yellow. They sold 50 million boxes during the war.\n\nThe box's primary color changed to blue in 1954. A version with spiral-shaped noodles debuted in 1975 while Velveeta Shells & Cheese were introduced in 1984.\n\nIn 2006, the cheddar and white cheddar versions switched to organic macaroni. While Easy Mac Cups were introduced the same year. The following year the noodles switched to 50 percent whole grain.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese Crackers also debuted in 2007. The crackers were discontinued in 2008, as they did not meet company targets. A sub-line, Homestyle Deluxe, was added in 2010 in three flavors, cheddar, four-cheese sauce, and Old World Italian.\n\nKraft Macaroni and Cheese sold in the United States used to include Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 to make the food a brighter colour. In Europe, food that contains Yellow 5 requires a warning label saying, \"This product may have adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\" In 2014, none of the European varieties were made with artificial dyes.\n\nOn November 1, 2013, Kraft announced that new pasta shape varieties for children in the U.S. would no longer include Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, and there would be a decrease in the sodium and saturated fat content, and six more grams of whole grains.\n\nIn April 2015, it was announced that those changes, including the elimination of artificial preservatives, would be extended throughout the line after January 2016. Paprika, annatto and turmeric are used for colouring. According to Kraft, the changes were a response to consumer feedback.\n\nKraft Dinner has been called the de facto national dish of Canada. Packaged in Quebec with Canadian wheat and milk, and other ingredients from Canada and the US, Canadians purchase 1.7 million of the 7 million boxes sold globally each week and eat an average of 3.2 boxes of Kraft Dinner each year, 55% more than Americans. The meal is the most popular grocery item in the country, where \"Kraft Dinner\" has iconic status and has become a generic trademark of sorts for macaroni and cheese. It is often simply referred to by the initials K.D. As Kraft Dinner has a different name in Canada from the United States and other markets, the Canadian marketing and advertising platform is a made-in-Canada effort as US advertising cannot be easily adapted.\n\nPundit Rex Murphy wrote that \"Kraft Dinner revolves in that all-but-unobtainable orbit of the Tim Hortons doughnut and the A&W Teen Burger. It is one of that great trinity of quick digestibles that have been enrolled as genuine Canadian cultural icons.\" Douglas Coupland wrote that \"cheese plays a weirdly large dietary role in the lives of Canadians, who have a more intimate and intense relationship with Kraft food products than the citizens of any other country. This is not a shameless product plug -- for some reason, Canadians and Kraft products have bonded the way Australians have bonded with Marmite [sic, recte:Vegemite], or the English with Heinz baked beans. In particular, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, known simply as Kraft Dinner, is the biggie, probably because it so precisely laser-targets the favoured Canadian food groups: fat, sugar, starch and salt\". Immigrants often mention Kraft Dinner when surveys ask for examples of Canadian food. As a measure of the product's Canadian popularity, its Facebook page, KD Battle Zone, attracted 270,000 fans, despite there being no prizes for the contest.\n\nCanadian rock band Barenaked Ladies refer to the product in their popular song \"If I Had $1000000\", indicating that they would continue to eat the inexpensive foodstuff even if they were millionaires. This has often prompted fans at live concerts to throw boxes of Kraft Dinner onto the stage when the line is sung; the band has discouraged this and have urged fans to donate the boxes to their local food bank instead.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Paul Martin regularly referred to it as his favourite food, though also confessed that he was unable to prepare it. During the same election former Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that \"I'll never be able to give my kids a billion-dollar company, but Laureen and I are saving for their education. And I have actually cooked them Kraft Dinner — I like to add wieners.\" Most of his countrymen ignore the instructions and believe that they have a unique way of preparing the food, like adding wieners or cheese. Additional ingredients are not necessary; simply adjusting the cooking time and the amount of milk or butter/margarine can produce a dish ranging from soft noodles in a creamy sauce to firm noodles in a thin, milky sauce.\n\nIn the September 2012 issue of \"The Walrus\" magazine, the cover story \"Manufacturing Taste\" by Sasha Chapman details the history of the Canadian cheese industry and Kraft's impact on it. She notably draws attention to Canada being unique in favouring a manufactured food product (made by a foreign company) as its national dish at the expense of local cheeses. Chapman's article is structured around this question, from the first page:\n\nKraft Dinner is a frequent staple of Canadian university student diets, particularly those in heavy debt. Consequently, university students protesting government funding cuts and tuition hikes have often used Kraft Dinner as props to draw attention to their plight.\n\nThe box describes a simple three step process (the \"cooking instructions\") for preparing the dinner. The 1-2-3 directions include \"Boil\", \"Drain\", and \"Add\". \"Boiling\" is further defined as boiling water and adding the pasta, with no reference to added salt or covering of the pan. The directions indicate the pasta cooking time, usually as a range. The \"Drain\" step shows a colander being used. The last step, \"Add\", says to add all the ingredients back to the pot (with no reference to whether to leave the pot on the stove or turn off the burner) and mix thoroughly.\n\nAlthough many people have their own personal preferences for quantities of added ingredients, the box has a \"classic prep\" list that says to use 6 cups water, 4 Tbsp. margarine or butter, and 1/4 cup milk. It does not say whether to use salted or unsalted butter. And it does not say whether to use 2% or whole milk. People may also vary the \"cooking instructions\" to their personal preferences, which may include adding salt to the water or omitting ingredients like milk. \n\nNew product lines using different flavors and pasta shapes have been introduced over the decades and the shelf life has at various times been increased. Kraft Dinner is seen as an inexpensive, easy-to-make comfort food, with marketing that highlights its value and convenience.\n\nThe product now comes in several compositions:\n\n\nKraft Dinner Smart (also known as \"KD Smart\") is a sub-brand of the Kraft Dinner brand. It represents a line of Kraft macaroni and cheese products that contain no artificial flavours, colours or preservatives and have added ingredients like cauliflower, oats or flax seed blended into the noodles. It comes in four varieties:\n\nKraft Dinner Smart originally launched in Canada in March 2010 with two vegetable varieties. In June 2011, the line-up was re-launched with new packaging graphics and two new varieties (Flax Omega-3 and High Fibre).\n\nThe product is made with real Kraft cheddar and is manufactured in Mount Royal, Quebec.\n\nThe product was originally marketed as Kraft Dinner with the slogan \"a meal for four in nine minutes for an everyday price of 19 cents.\" It was re-branded to \"Kraft Macaroni & Cheese\" in the United States and other countries, although the word \"Dinner\" still appears in small type on the U.S. version. In several markets it goes by different names; in the United Kingdom it is also marketed as \"Cheesey Pasta\".\n\nThe product is heavily promoted toward children in the United States on television. When advertising to younger children, the television advertisement encourages the children to ask for \"The Blue Box.\" In 2010 Kraft launched a $50 million multi-media marketing campaign with a nostalgia theme aimed at adults to promote all varieties of Kraft dinner. In Canada, Kraft has advertising programs intended to make the meal appealing to newly arrived immigrant groups.\n\nThere are regular promotional tie-in versions of the Kraft Dinner, aimed at kids. Packages have come with pasta in the shapes of various characters popular with children, such as Looney Tunes, Super Mario Bros., PB&J Otter, Pokémon, Spider-Man, Rugrats, The Fairly OddParents, The Flintstones, Peanuts, Scooby-Doo, Madagascar, How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story, Phineas and Ferb, Cars, Monsters University, Finding Dory, SpongeBob SquarePants, Despicable Me, Trolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Frozen, and Star Wars. Kraft Foods has also released many products under the product banner. These include other versions of macaroni and cheese with different shaped pasta and different flavours, but it has also included completely different dishes, such as spaghetti in several different flavours.\n\nIn promotion of the introduction of its \"Cheddar Explosion\" variety of Kraft Dinner, Kraft sponsored the demolition of Texas Stadium April 11, 2010. In its last act of 2009 the Irving, Texas, city council made Kraft Macaroni and Cheese the official sponsor of the demolition. Kraft paid $75,000 to local charities and donated $75,000 in Kraft products. A national essay contest directed at children who \"have made a difference in their community\" was held with the winner allowed to push the button initiating the controlled demolition. The winning essayist was 11-year-old Casey Rogers of Terrell, Texas, founder of a charity serving the homeless.\n\nA single serving of American \"original flavor\" is 2.5 ounces of dry noodles and cheese powder with 4/3 Tablespoon margarine and 1/12 cup milk.

The dish originated in French cafés and bars as a quick snack. A croque madame (French for \"missus crunch\") is a variant of the dish topped with a fried egg.\n\nThe name is based on the verb \"croquer\" (\"to bite, to crunch\") and the word \"monsieur\" (\"mister\"). The sandwich's first recorded appearance on a Paris café menu was in 1910. Its earliest mention in literature appears to be in volume two of Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" in 1918.\n\nA \"croque monsieur\" is traditionally made with boiled ham between slices of brioche-like \"pain de mie\" topped with grated cheese and slightly salted and peppered, which is baked in an oven or fried in a frying pan. The dish can also be made with normal butter bread, with a soft crust. Instead of the butter bread, the bread may optionally be browned by grilling before being dipped in beaten egg. Traditionally, Emmental or Gruyère is used, or sometimes Comté cheese as well. Some brasseries also add Béchamel sauce.\n\n\"Croque monsieur\" may be baked or fried so that the cheese topping melts and forms a crust. This may be done in a small horizontal grill designed for grilling sandwiches.\n\nA croque monsieur served with a poached or lightly fried egg on top is known as a \"croque madame\" (or in parts of Normandy a \"croque-à-cheval\"). Many cooking and recipe sites, such as New York Times Cooking and Food Network, attribute the name to the egg resembling an old fashioned woman's hat. According to the \"Petit Robert\" dictionary, the name dates to around 1960. The name \"croque-mademoiselle\" is associated with its lighter, vegetarian version: made of the same bread, but with ordinary melting cheese, accompanied with chives, cucumber and salad.\n\nA ham and cheese sandwich snack, very similar to the croque-monsieur though not containing any béchamel or egg, is called a tosti in the Netherlands, and toast (pronounced \"tost\") in Italy and Greece. Similarly, in the United Kingdom a ham and cheese hot snack is called a 'toastie', and toastie makers are available to buy. In the United States, the Monte Cristo, a ham-and-cheese sandwich often dipped in egg and fried, is popular diner fare, and a 'grilled cheese sandwich' is a classic sandwich that has been enjoyed at home and in cafeteria-style restaurants since the Great Depression. A version of this sandwich in Spain replaces the ham with sobrassada, a soft sausage from the Balearic Islands that can be easily spread.\n\nVariants of the sandwich with substitutions or additional ingredients are given names modelled on the original \"croque-monsieur\", for example:\n\nThe French chef Jacques Pepin also makes a version using chicken instead of ham, which he demonstrated in the \"Our Favorite Sandwiches\" episode on the PBS series (and its coordinating cookbook of the same title) \"Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home\" in which he worked with Julia Child.\n"}

{"id": "302469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302469", "title": "Vajra", "text": "Vajra\n\nA vajra is a weapon used as a ritual object to symbolize both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force); the Sanskrit word has both these meanings.\n\nThe vajra is essentially a type of club with a ribbed spherical head. The ribs may meet in a ball-shaped top, or they may be separate and end in sharp points with which to stab. The vajra is the weapon of the Indian Vedic rain and thunder-deity Indra, and is used symbolically by the dharma traditions of Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, often to represent firmness of spirit and spiritual power. According to the Indian mythology, vajra is considered as one of the most powerful weapons in the universe The use of the vajra as a symbolic and ritual tool spread from India along with Indian religion and culture to other parts of Asia.\n\nAccording to Asko Parpola, the Sanskrit \"Vajra-\" and Avestan \"Vazra-\" both refer to a weapon of the Godhead, and are possibly from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*weg'-\" which means \"to be(come) powerful.\" It is related to Proto-Finno-Uralic \"*vaśara\", \"hammer, axe\", but both the Sanskrit and Finno-Ugric derivatives are likely Proto-Aryan or Proto-Indo-Aryan, but not Proto-Iranian, state Parpola and Carpelan, because of its palatalized sibilant.\n\nThe earliest mention of the vajra is in the Rigveda, part of the four Vedas. It is described as the weapon of Indra, the chief among Gods. Indra is described as using the vajra to kill sinners and ignorant persons. The Rigveda states that the weapon was made for Indra by Tvastar, the maker of divine instruments. The associated story describes Indra using the vajra, which he held in his hand, to slay the asura Vritra, who took the form of a serpent.\n\nOn account of his skill in wielding the vajra, some epithets used for Indra in the Rigveda were \"Vajrabhrit\" (bearing the vajra), \"Vajrivat\" or \"Vajrin\" (armed with the vajra), \"Vajradaksina\" (holding the vajra in his right hand), and \"Vajrabahu\" or \"Vajrahasta\" (holding the vajra in his hand). The association of the Vajra with Indra was continued with some modifications in the later Puranic literature, and in Buddhist works. Buddhaghoṣa, a major figure of Theravada Buddhism in the 5th century, identified the Bodhisattva Vajrapani with Indra.\n\nMany later puranas describe the vajra, with the story modified from the Rigvedic original. One major addition involves the role of the Sage Dadhichi. According to one account, Indra, the king of the deva was once driven out of devaloka by an asura named Vritra. The asura was the recipient of a boon whereby he could not be killed by any weapon that was known till the date of his receiving the boon and additionally that no weapon made of wood or metal could harm him. Indra, who had lost all hope of recovering his kingdom was said to have approached Shiva who could not help him. Indra along with Shiva and Brahma went to seek the aid of Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that only the weapon made from the bones of Dadhichi would defeat Vritra. Indra and the other deva therefore approached the sage, whom Indra had once beheaded, and asked him for his aid in defeating Vritra. Dadhichi acceded to the deva's request but said that he wished that he had time to go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers before he gave up his life for them. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisha Forest, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without a further loss of time. Dadhichi is then said to have given up his life by the art of yoga after which the gods fashioned the vajrayudha from his spine. This weapon was then used to defeat the asura, allowing Indra to reclaim his place as the king of devaloka.\n\nAnother version of the story exists where Dadhichi was asked to safeguard the weapons of the gods as they were unable to match the arcane arts being employed by the asura to obtain them. Dadhichi is said to have kept at the task for a very long time and finally tiring of the job, he is said to have dissolved the weapons in sacred water which he drank. The deva returned a long time later and asked him to return their weapons so that they might defeat the asura, headed by Vritra, once and for all. Dadhichi however told them of what he had done and informed them that their weapons were now a part of his bones. However, Dadhichi, realising that his bones were the only way by which the deva could defeat the asura willingly gave his life in a pit of mystical flames he summoned with the power of his austerities. Brahma is then said to have fashioned a large number of weapons from Dadhichi's bones, including the vajrayudha, which was fashioned from his spine. The deva are then said to have defeated the asura using the weapons thus created.\n\nThere have also been instances where the war god Skanda (Kartikeya) is described as holding a vajra. Skanda is also the name of a bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism who wields a vajra.\n\nIn Buddhism the vajra is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major branches of Buddhism. Vajrayana is translated as \"Thunderbolt Way\" or \"Diamond Way\" and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or \"bodhi\". It also implies indestructibility, just as diamonds are harder than other gemstones.\n\nIn Tantric Buddhism (Vajrayana) the vajra and tribu (bell) are used in many rites by a lama or any Vajrayana practitioner of sadhana. The vajra is a male polysemic symbol that represents many things for the tantrika. The vajra is representative of upaya (skilful means) whereas its companion tool, the bell which is a female symbol, denotes prajna (wisdom). Some deities are shown holding each the vajra and bell in separate hands, symbolizing the union of the forces of compassion and wisdom, respectively.\n\nIn the tantric traditions of Buddhism, the vajra is a symbol for the nature of reality, or \"sunyata\", indicating endless creativity, potency, and skillful activity. The term is employed extensively in tantric literature: the term for the spiritual teacher is the \"vajracharya\"; one of the five dhyani buddhas is \"vajrasattva\", and so on. The practice of prefixing terms, names, places, and so on by vajra represents the conscious attempt to recognize the transcendental aspect of all phenomena; it became part of the process of \"sacramentalizing\" the activities of the spiritual practitioner and encouraged him to engage all his psychophysical energies in the spiritual life.\n\nAn instrument symbolizing vajra is also extensively used in the rituals of the tantra. It consists of a spherical central section, with two symmetrical sets of five prongs, which arc out from lotus blooms on either side of the sphere and come to a point at two points equidistant from the centre, thus giving it the appearance of a \"diamond sceptre\", which is how the term is sometimes translated.\n\nVarious figures in Tantric iconography are represented holding or wielding the vajra. Three of the most famous of these are Vajrasattva, Vajrapani, and Padmasambhava. Vajrasattva (lit. vajra-being) holds the vajra, in his right hand, to his heart. The figure of the Wrathful Vajrapani (lit. vajra in the hand) brandishes the vajra, in his right hand, above his head. Padmasambhava holds the vajra above his right knee in his right hand.\n\nThe vajra is almost always paired with a ritual bell. Tibetan term for a ritual bell used in Buddhist religious practices is \"tribu\". Priests and devotees ring bells during the rituals. Together these ritual implements represent the inseparability of wisdom and compassion in the enlightened mindstream. \n\nThe bell is the most commonly used of all musical instruments in tantric Buddhist ritual. The sound made by the bells is regarded as very auspicious and is believed to drive out evil spirits from where the ritual is being performed. When the bell is being used with the dorje its use is varied depending on the ritual or the mantras being chanted. During meditation ringing the bell represents the sound of Buddha teaching the dharma and symbolizes the attainment of wisdom and the understanding of emptiness. During the chanting of the mantras the Bell and Dorje are used together in a variety of different ritualistic ways to represent the union of the male and female principles.\n\nThe vajra is made up of several parts. In the center is a sphere which represents Sunyata, the primordial nature of the universe, the underlying unity of all things. Emerging from the sphere are two eight petaled lotus flowers. One represents the phenomenal world (or in Buddhist terms Samsara), the other represents the noumenal world (Nirvana). This is one of the fundamental dichotomies which are perceived by the unenlightened. The physical manifestation of the vajra, also called dorje in this context, is the male organ.\n\nArranged equally around the mouth of the lotus are two, four, or eight creatures which are called makara. These are mythological half-fish, half-crocodile creatures made up of two or more animals, often representing the union of opposites, (or a harmonisation of qualities that transcend our usual experience). From the mouths of the makara come tongues which come together in a point.\n\nThe five-pronged vajra (with four makara, plus a central prong) is the most commonly seen vajra. There is an elaborate system of correspondences between the five elements of the noumenal side of the vajra, and the phenomenal side. One important correspondence is between the five \"poisons\" with the five wisdoms. The five poisons are the mental states that obscure the original purity of a being's mind, while the five wisdoms are the five most important aspects of the enlightened mind. Each of the five wisdoms is also associated with a Buddha figure. (see also Five Wisdom Buddhas)\n\nThe hollow of the bell represents the void from which all phenomena arise, including the sound of the bell, and the clapper represents form. Together they symbolize wisdom (emptiness) and compassion (form or appearance). The sound, like all phenomena, arises, radiates forth and then dissolves back into emptiness.\n\nParam Vir Chakra, India's highest war time military decoration has a motif of Vajra, the mythic weapon of Indra created by the bones donated by sage Dadhichi, as tribute to his sacrifice.\n\nIn the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons a dorje is a one-handed weapon for bludgeoning.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "302771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302771", "title": "Art glass", "text": "Art glass\n\nArt glass is an item that is made, generally as an artwork for decoration but often also for utility, from glass, sometimes combined with other materials. Techniques include stained glass windows, leaded lights (also called leadlights), glass that has been placed into a kiln so that it will mould into a shape, glassblowing, sandblasted glass, and copper-foil glasswork. In general the term is restricted to relatively modern pieces made by people who see themselves as artists who have chosen to work in the medium of glass and both design and make their own pieces as fine art, rather than traditional glassworker craftsmen, who often produce pieces designed by others, though their pieces certainly may form part of art. Studio glass is another term often used for modern glass made for artistic purposes. Art glass has grown in popularity in recent years with many artists becoming famous for their work; and, as a result, more colleges are offering courses in glass work.\n\nStained glass, such as the windows that are seen in churches, are windows that contain an element of painting in them. The window is designed. After the glass has been cut to shape, paint that contains ground glass is applied, so that, when it is fired in a kiln, the paint fuses onto the glass surface. Following this process, the sections of glass are placed together and held in place with lead came that is then soldered at the joints. Leadlights and stained glass are manufactured in the same way, but leadlights do not contain any sections of glass that have been painted.\n\nGlassblowing is one of the most used technique for creating \"art glass\" and is still favoured by most of today's studio glass artists. This is because of the artist's intimacy with the material, and an almost infinite opportunity for creativity and variation at almost every stage of the process. Glassblowing can be used to create a multitude of shapes and can incorporate color through a wide range of techniques. Coloured glass can be gathered out of a crucible, clear glass can be rolled in powdered colored glass to coat the outside of a bubble, it can be rolled in chips of glass, it can be stretched into rods and incorporated through caneworking, or it can be layered, cut and fused into tiles, and incorporated into a bubble of glass for intricate patterns through murrine. \"Blown glass\" refers only to individually hand-made items but can include the use of moulds for shaping, ribbing, and spiking to produce decorative bubbles. Glass blown articles must be made of compatible glass or the stress in the piece will cause a failure.\n\nKiln formed glass is usually referred to as warm glass, and can be either made up from a single piece of glass that is slumped into or over a mould or different colours and sheets of glass fused together. The process of hot glass is highly scientific in that the types of glass and temperatures that they must be fired at is quite complicated operation to undertake correctly. Art glass that is kiln formed usually take the form of dishes, plates or tiles. Glass that is fused in a kiln must be of the same co-efficient of expansion (CoE). If glass that does not have the same CoE is used for fusing, the differing rates of contraction will cause minute stress fractures to form and, over time, these fractures will cause a piece to crack. The use of polarizing filters to inspect the work will determine if stress fractures are present.\n\nCold glass is worked by any method that does not use heat. Processes include sandblasting, cutting, sawing, chiseling, bonding and gluing.\n\nGlass can be decorated by sandblasting the surface of a piece in order to remove a layer of glass, thereby making a design stand out. Items that are sandblasted are usually thick slabs of glass into which a design has been carved by means of high pressure sandblasting. This technique provides a three-dimensional effect but is not suitable for toughened glass as the process could shatter it.\n\nThe technique of using copperfoil is mainly used in the construction of smaller pieces such as Tiffany style lamps, and it was, in fact, frequently used by Louis Comfort Tiffany. It consists of wrapping cut sections of glass in a self-adhesive tape that is made out of thin copper foil. This technique requires a great deal of dexterity and is also very time-consuming. After the sections have been foiled, they are soldered together in order to form the item.\n\nMost antique art glass was made in factories, particularly in the UK, the United States, and Bohemia, where items were made to a standard, or \"pattern\". This would seem contrary to the idea that art glass is distinctive and shows individual skill. However, the importance of decoration – in the Victorian era in particular – meant that much of the artistry lay with the decorator. Any assumption today that factory-made items were necessarily made by machine is incorrect. Up to about 1940, most of the processes involved in making decorative art glass were performed by hand.\n\nManufacturers got around the problem of an inherent similarity in their products in various ways. First, they would frequently change designs according to demand. This was especially so in the export-dependent factories of Bohemia where salesmen would report sales trends back to the factory during each trip. Second, the decoration for mid- and lower-market items, often done by contracted \"piece\" workers, was often a variation on a theme. Such was the skill of these subcontractors that a reasonable standard of quality and a high rate of output were generally maintained. Finally, a high degree of differentiation could be gained from the multiplication of shapes, colours, and decorative designs, yielding many different combinations. Concurrently, from the same factories came distinctive, artistic items produced in more limited quantities for the upper-market consumer. These were decorated in-house where decorators could work closely with designers and management in order to produce a piece that was profitable.\n\nMany items that are now considered art glass were originally intended for use. Often that use has ceased to be relevant, but even if not, in the Victorian era and for some decades beyond useful items were often decorated to such a high degree that we can now appreciate them for their artistic or design merits.\n\nSome art glass retains its original purpose but has come to be appreciated more for its art than for its use. Collectors of antique perfume bottles, for example, tend to display their items empty. As items of packaging, these bottles would originally have been used and thus would not ordinarily have been considered art glass. However, because of fashion trends, then as now, producers supplied goods in beautiful packaging. Lalique's Art Nouveau and Art Deco designs and Joseph Hoffman's Art Deco designs have come to be considered art glass due to their stylish and highly original decorative designs.\n\nLikewise, certain usable novelty items once produced for the gift trade, such as the paperweights crafted by Scottish artist Paul Ysart, are today considered valuable works of art glass owing to their creative and complex designs.\n\nA major shift in the definition of what constituted \"art glass\" came with the 1977 publication of the book \"Glass - Art Nouveau to Art Deco\" by Victor Arwas. Following the book's publication there was a growing recognition that moulded, mass-produced glass with little or no decoration but high artistic and fabrication quality such as that produced by Lalique should be considered art glass.\n\n\nUp-market refined glassware, usually lead crystal, is highly decorated and is revered for its high quality of workmanship, the purity of the metal (molten glass mixture), and the decorative techniques used, most often cutting and gilding. Both techniques continue to be used in the decoration of many pieces made from lead crystal, and nowadays these pieces are regarded as art glass.\n\nCut glass is most often produced by hand, but automation is now becoming more common. Some designs show artistic flair, but most tend to be regular, geometric, and repetitious. Occasionally, the design can be considered a \"pattern\" to be replicated as exactly as possible, with the main purpose being to accentuate the refractive qualities, or \"sparkle\", of the crystal – certainly an aesthetic consideration, but not generally considered artistic.\n\nA clear exception could be made for the highly distinctive cut crystal designs which were produced in limited quantities by designers of note. Examples are the designs of Keith Murray for Steven & Williams and those of Clyne Farquharson for John Walsh Walsh. A relatively new term is coming into use for this genre: \"Art Cut\" \n\n"}
{"id": "303690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303690", "title": "Spall", "text": "Spall\n\nSpall are flakes of a material that are broken off a larger solid body and can be produced by a variety of mechanisms, including as a result of projectile impact, corrosion, weathering, cavitation, or excessive rolling pressure (as in a ball bearing). Spalling and spallation both describe the process of surface failure in which spall is shed.\n\nThe terms spall, spalling, and spallation have been adopted by particle physicists; in neutron scattering instruments, neutrons are generated by bombarding a uranium target with a stream of atoms. The neutrons that are ejected from the target are known as spall.\n\nMechanical spalling occurs at high stress contact points, for example, in a ball bearing. Spalling occurs in preference to brinelling where the maximal shear stress occurs not at the surface, but just below, shearing the spall off.\n\nOne of the simplest forms of mechanical spalling is plate impact, in which two waves of compression are reflected on the free-surfaces of the plates and then interact to generate a region of high tensile stress inside one of the plates.\n\nSpalling can also occur as an effect of cavitation, where fluids are subjected to localized low pressures that cause vapor bubbles to form, typically in pumps, water turbines, vessel propellers, and even piping under some conditions. When such bubbles collapse, a localized high pressure can cause spalling on adjacent surfaces.\n\nIn anti-tank warfare, spalling through mechanical stress is an intended effect of high-explosive squash head (HESH) anti-tank shells and many other munitions which may not be powerful enough to pierce the armor of a target. The relatively soft warhead, containing or made of plastic explosive, flattens against the armor plating on tanks and other armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and explodes, creating a shock wave that travels through the armor as a compression wave and is reflected at the free surface as a tensile wave breaking (tensile stress/strain fracture) the metal on the inside. The resulting spall is dangerous to crew and equipment, and may result in a partial or complete disablement of a vehicle and/or its crew. Many AFVs are equipped with spall liners inside their armor for protection.\n\nA kinetic energy penetrator, if it can defeat the armor, generally causes spalling within the target as well, which helps to destroy/disable the vehicle and/or its crew.\n\nSpalling is a common mechanism of rock weathering, and occurs at the surface of a rock when there are large shear stresses under the surface. This form of mechanical weathering can be caused by freezing and thawing, unloading, thermal expansion and contraction, or salt deposition.\n\nUnloading is the release of pressure due to the removal of an overburden. When the pressure is reduced rapidly, the rapid expansion of the rock causes high surface stress and spalling.\n\nFreeze–thaw weathering is caused by moisture freezing inside cracks in rock. Upon freezing its volume expands, causing large forces which cracks spall off the outer surface. As this cycle repeats the outer surface repeatedly undergoes spalling, resulting in weathering.\n\nSome stone and masonry surfaces used as building surfaces will absorb moisture at their surface. If exposed to severe freezing conditions the surface may flake off due to the expansion of the water. This effect can also be seen in terra-cotta surfaces (even if glazed) if there is an entrance for water at the edges.\n\nExfoliation (or onion skin weathering) is the gradual removing of spall due to the cyclic increase and decrease in the temperature of the surface layers of the rock. Rocks do not conduct heat well, so when they are exposed to extreme heat the outermost layer becomes much hotter than the rock underneath causing differential thermal expansion. This differential expansion causes sub-surface shear stress, in turn causing spalling. Extreme temperature change, such as forest fires, can also cause spalling of rock. This mechanism of weathering causes the outer surface of the rock to fall off in thin fragments, sheets or flakes, hence the name exfoliation or onion skin weathering.\n\nSalt spalling is a specific type of weathering which occurs in porous building materials, such as brick, natural stone, tiles and concrete. Dissolved salt is carried through the material in water and crystallizes inside the material near the surface as the water evaporates. As the salt crystals expand this builds up shear stresses which break away spall from the surface.\n\nSome believe that porous building materials can be protected against salt spalling by treatment with penetrating sealants which are hydrophobic (water repellent) and will penetrate deeply enough to keep water with dissolved salts well away from the surface. Great care and expert advice must be consulted, however, to ensure that any coating is compatible with the substrate in terms of breathability (ability to allow the release of vapors from inside while preventing water intrusion), or other serious problems can be created. \n\nChimneys show spalling damage before other portions of buildings because they are more exposed to the elements.\n\nIn corrosion, spalling occurs when a substance (metal or concrete) sheds tiny particles of corrosion products as the corrosion reaction progresses. Although they are not soluble or permeable, these corrosion products do not adhere to the parent material's surface to form a barrier to further corrosion, as happens in passivation. Spallation happens as the result of a large volume change during the reaction.\n\nIn the case of actinide metals (most notably the depleted uranium used in some types of ammunition), the material expands so strongly upon exposure to air that a fine layer of oxide is forcibly expelled from the surface. A slowly oxidised plug of metallic uranium can sometimes resemble an onion subjected to desquamation. The main hazard however arises from the pyrophoric character of actinide metals which can spontaneously ignite when their specific area is high. This property, along with these elements inherent toxicity and (for some to a lesser extent) radioactivity, make them dangerous to handle in metallic form under air. Therefore, they are often handled under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) inside an anaerobic glovebox.\n\nThere are two drivers for spalling of concrete: thermal strain caused by rapid heating and internal pressures due to the removal of water. Being able to predict the outcome of different heating rates on thermal stresses and internal pressure during water removal is particularly important to industry and other concrete structures.\n\nExplosive spalling events of refractory concrete can result in serious problems. If an explosive spalling occurs, projectiles of reasonable mass (1–10 kg) can be thrust violently over many metres, which will have safety implications and render the refractory structure unfit for service. Repairs will then be required resulting in significant costs to industry.\n\n\n"}

It is often used to impart a yellow or orange color to foods, but sometimes also for its flavor and aroma. Its scent is described as \"slightly peppery with a hint of nutmeg\" and flavor as \"slightly nutty, sweet and peppery\".\n\nThe color of annatto comes from various carotenoid pigments, mainly bixin and norbixin, found in the reddish waxy coating of the seeds. The condiment is typically prepared by grinding the seeds to a powder or paste. Similar effects can be obtained by extracting some of the color and flavor principles from the seeds with hot water, oil, or lard, which are then added to the food.\n\nAnnatto and its extracts are now widely used in an artisanal or industrial scale as a coloring agent in many processed food products, such as cheeses, dairy spreads, butter and margarine, custards, cakes and other baked goods, potatoes, snack foods, breakfast cereals, smoked fish, sausages, and more. In these uses, annatto is a natural alternative to synthetic food coloring compounds, but it has been linked to rare cases of food-related allergies. Annatto is of particular commercial value in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration considers colorants derived from it to be \"exempt of certification\".\n\nThe annatto tree \"B. orellana\" is believed to originate in tropical regions from Mexico to Brazil. It was probably not initially used as a food additive, but for other purposes such as ritual and decorative body painting (still an important tradition in many Brazilian native tribes), sunscreen, and insect repellent, and for medical purposes. It was used for Mexican manuscript painting in the 16th century.\n\nAnnatto has been traditionally used as both a coloring and flavoring agent in Latin America, the Caribbean, the Philippines, and other countries where it was taken home by Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 16th century. It has various local names according to region. Its use has spread in historic times to other parts of the world, and it was incorporated in local culinary traditions of many countries outside the Americas.\n\nGround annatto seeds, often mixed with other seeds or spices, are used in the form of paste or powder for culinary use, especially in Latin American, Jamaican, Belizean, Chamorro, Vietnamese, and Filipino cuisines. In Mexican and Belizean cuisines, it is used to make the spice \"recado rojo\". In Venezuela, annatto is used in the preparation of \"hallacas, perico\", and other traditional dishes. \"Pasteles \"and \"sazón\" in Puerto Rico also contain annatto. Annatto paste is an important ingredient of \"cochinita pibil\", the spicy pork dish popular in Mexico. It is also a key ingredient in the drink \"tascalate\" from Chiapas, Mexico. In the Philippines, it is used for the sauce of \"pancit\".\n\nAnnatto is used currently to impart a yellow or orange color to many industrialized and semi-industrialized foods. In the European Union, it is identified by the E number E160b.\n\nAnnatto has been a traditional colorant for Gloucester cheese since the 16th century. During the summer, the high levels of carotene in the grass would have given the milk an orange tint which was carried through into the cheese. This orange hue came to be regarded as an indicator of the best cheese, spurring producers of inferior cheese to use annatto to replicate it. The custom of adding annatto then spread to other parts of the UK, for cheeses such as Cheshire and Red Leicester, as well as colored Cheddar made in Scotland. Many cheddars are produced in both white and red (orange) varieties, with the latter being more popular despite the only difference between the two being the presence of annatto as a coloring. That practice has extended to many modern processed cheese products, such as American cheese and Velveeta.\n\nThe yellow to orange color is produced by the chemical compounds bixin and norbixin, which are classified as carotenoids. The fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called bixin, which can then be saponified into water-soluble norbixin. This dual solubility property of annatto is rare for carotenoids. The seeds contain 4.5–5.5% pigment, which consists of 70–80% bixin. Unlike beta-carotene, another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not vitamin A precursors. The more norbixin in an annatto color, the more yellow it is; a higher level of bixin gives it a more orange shade.\n\nIn the United States, annatto extract is listed as a color additive \"exempt from certification\" and is informally considered to be a natural coloring. Foods colored with annatto may declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients as \"colored with annatto\" or \"annatto color.\"\n\nAnnatto condiments and colorants are safe for most people when used in food amounts, but they may cause allergic reactions in those who are sensitive. In one 1978 study of 61 patients suffering from chronic hives or angioedema, 56 patients were orally provoked by annatto extract during an elimination diet. A challenge was performed with a dose equivalent to the amount used in of butter. Twenty-six percent of the patients reacted to this color four hours after intake, worse than synthetic dyes such as amaranth (9%), tartrazine (11%), Sunset Yellow FCF (17%), Food Red 17 (16%), Ponceau 4R (15%), erythrosine (12%) and Brilliant Blue FCF (14%).\n\nAnnatto is not among the \"Big Eight\" substances causing hypersensitivity reactions (cow's milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat), which are responsible for more than 90% of allergic food reactions. The Food and Drug Administration and experts at the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP) at the University of Nebraska do not include annatto in the list of major food allergens.\n\nAs annatto is a source of tocotrienols, such as geranylgeraniol—compounds similar in structure and function to vitamin E—its extracts were under preliminary research to determine their potential biological properties in humans. In one such application, annatto geranylgeraniol is an ingredient in an experimental medical food being investigated for its effect on blood lipoproteins.\n\n\n"}

The word shalom is also found in many other expressions and names. Its equivalent cognate in Arabic is \"salaam\", \"sliem\" in Maltese, Shlama in Syriac-Assyrian and \"sälam\" in Ethiopian Semitic languages from the Proto-Semitic root Š-L-M.\n\nIn Hebrew, words are built on \"roots\", generally of three consonants. When the root consonants appear with various vowels and additional letters, a variety of words, often with some relation in meaning, can be formed from a single root. Thus from the root \"sh-l-m\" come the words \"shalom\" (\"peace, well-being\"), \"hishtalem\" (\"it was worth it\"), \"shulam\" (\"was paid for\"), \"meshulam\" (\"paid for in advance\"), \"mushlam\" (\"perfect\"), and \"shalem\" (\"whole\").\n\nIn translations of the Bible, \"shalom\" may be translated as \"peace\" (English), \"paz\" (Spanish and Portuguese), \"paix\" (French), \"pace\" (Italian), or \"pax\" (Latin). The concept of peace is important in Christianity.\n\nBiblically, \"shalom\" is seen in reference to the well-being of others (Genesis 43:27, Exodus 4:18), to treaties (I Kings 5:12), and in prayer for the wellbeing of cities or nations (Psalm 122:6, Jeremiah 29:7). \n\nThe meaning of completeness, central to the term \"shalom\", can also be confirmed in related terms found in other Semitic languages. The Assyrian term \"salamu\" means to be complete, unharmed, paid/atoned. \"Sulmu\", another Assyrian term, means welfare. A closer relation to the idea of \"shalom\" as concept and action is seen in the Arabic root \"salaam\", meaning to be safe, secure and forgiven, among other things.\n\nThe word \"shalom\" can be used for all parts of speech; as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, and interjection. It categorizes all shaloms. The word \"shalom\" is used in a variety of expressions and contexts in Hebrew speech and writing:\n\n\nIn Judaism, Shalom (peace), is one of the underlying principles of the Torah: \"Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom (peace)\".\" The Talmud explains, \"The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom\". Maimonides comments in his Mishneh Torah: \"Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, 'Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace'\".\n\nIn the book \"Not the Way It's Supposed to Be: A Breviary of Sin\", author Cornelius Plantinga described the Old Testament concept of shalom:\n\nThe webbing together of God, humans, and all creation in justice, fulfillment, and delight is what the Hebrew prophets call shalom. We call it peace but it means far more than mere peace of mind or a cease-fire between enemies. In the Bible, shalom means universal flourishing, wholeness and delight – a rich state of affairs in which natural needs are satisfied and natural gifts fruitfully employed, a state of affairs that inspires joyful wonder as its Creator and Savior opens doors and welcomes the creatures in whom he delights. Shalom, in other words, is the way things ought to be.\n\nThe Talmud says, \"the name of God is 'Peace'\", therefore, one is not permitted to greet another with the word \"shalom\" in places such as a bathroom.\n\nBiblical references make many Christians teach that \"Shalom\" is one of the sacred names of God.\n\n\"Shalom\" is also common in modern Hebrew in Israel, as a given name or a surname. It is usually used by men as a given name but there are women named Shalom as well such as the model Shalom Harlow.\n\n\n\"Shalom\" can be part of an organization's name.\n\nFor example, the names of the following organizations and places refer to \"peace\" between Israel and its Arab neighbors:\n\n\n\"Shalom\" is used as part of other names, such as for synagogues, as in:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries.\n\nThe name is from the Spanish \"frijoles refritos\", \"refritos\" meaning \"rehashed\" or \"reheated\" in English. It isn't truly fried, so it is not an exact translation.\n\nIn this dish, after being boiled and then mashed into a paste, the beans are sometimes then fried or baked, though usually neither, thus making the term \"refried\" even more misleading.\n\nIn northern Mexico and in Tex-Mex cuisine, refried beans are usually prepared with pinto beans, but many other varieties of bean are used in other parts of Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red kidney beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter and seasoned to taste with salt and spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.\n\nIn home cooking, refried beans are often served as a side dish accompanying a larger meal, or rolled in a tortilla to form a bean burrito.\n\nIn the United States, refried beans are most commonly made from pinto beans. They are served as a side dish with most Tex-Mex restaurant meals. They also have become very popular as a dip for corn tortilla chips. Refried beans are also a primary ingredient in many tostada, chimichanga, and pupusa recipes. Additionally, they are a typical ingredient in layered dips, such as seven-layer dip or in nachos.\n\n"}
{"id": "304519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304519", "title": "Verismo (music)", "text": "Verismo (music)\n\nIn opera, verismo (, from , meaning \"true\") was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano, Francesco Cilea and Giacomo Puccini.\n\"Verismo\" as an operatic genre had its origins in an Italian literary movement of the same name. This was in turn related to the international literary movement of naturalism as practised by Émile Zola and others. Like naturalism, the \"verismo\" literary movement sought to portray the world with greater realism. In so doing, Italian \"verismo\" authors such as Giovanni Verga wrote about subject matter, such as the lives of the poor, that had not generally been seen as a fit subject for literature.\n\nA short story by Verga called \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (), then developed into a play by the same author, became the source for what is usually considered to be the first \"verismo\" opera: \"Cavalleria rusticana\" by Mascagni, which premiered on 17 May 1890 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. Thus begun, the operatic genre of \"verismo\" produced a handful of notable works such as \"Pagliacci\", which premiered at Teatro Dal Verme in Milan on 21 May 1892, and Puccini's \"Tosca\" (premiering at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900.) The genre peaked in the early 1900s, and lingered into the 1920s.\n\nIn terms of subject matter, generally \"[v]erismo operas focused not on gods, mythological figures, or kings and queens, but on the average contemporary man and woman and their problems, generally of a sexual, romantic, or violent nature.\" However, two of the small handful of \"verismo\" operas still performed today take historical subjects: Puccini's Tosca and Giordano's \"Andrea Chénier.\" \"Musically, verismo composers consciously strove for the integration of the opera's underlying drama with its music.\" These composers abandoned the \"recitative and set-piece structure\" of earlier Italian opera. Instead, the operas were \"through-composed,\" with few breaks in a seamlessly integrated sung text. While \"verismo\" operas may contain arias that can be sung as stand-alone pieces, they are generally written to arise naturally from their dramatic surroundings, and their structure is variable, being based on text that usually does not follow a regular strophic format.\n\nThe most famous composers who created works in the \"verismo\" style were Giacomo Puccini, Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano and Francesco Cilea. There were, however, many other \"veristi\": Franco Alfano, Alfredo Catalani, Gustave Charpentier (\"Louise\"), Eugen d'Albert (\"Tiefland\"), Ignatz Waghalter (\"Der Teufelsweg\" and \"Jugend\"), Alberto Franchetti, Franco Leoni, Jules Massenet (\"La Navarraise\"), Licinio Refice, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari (\"I gioielli della Madonna\"), and Riccardo Zandonai.\n\nThe term \"verismo\" can cause confusion. In addition to referring to operas written in a realistic style, the term may also be used more broadly to refer to the entire output of the composers of the \"giovane scuola\" (\"young school\"), the generation of composers who were active in Italy during the period that the \"verismo\" style was created. One author (Alan Mallach) has proposed the term \"plebeian opera\" to refer to operas that adhere to the contemporary and realistic subject matter for which the term \"verismo\" was originally coined. At the same time, Mallach questions the value of using a term such as \"verismo\", which is supposedly descriptive of the subject and style of works, simply to identify an entire generation's music-dramatic output. For most of the composers associated with \"verismo\", traditionally veristic subjects accounted for only some of their operas. For instance, Mascagni wrote a pastoral comedy (\"L'amico Fritz\"), a symbolist work set in Japan (\"Iris\"), and a couple of medieval romances (\"Isabeau\" and \"Parisina\"). These works are far from typical \"verismo\" subject matter, yet they are written in the same general musical style as his more quintessential veristic subjects. In addition, there is disagreement among musicologists as to which operas are \"verismo\" operas, and which are not. (Non-Italian operas are generally excluded). Giordano's \"Andrea Chénier\", Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\", and Puccini's \"Tosca\" and \"Il tabarro\" are operas to which the term \"verismo\" is applied with little or no dispute. The term is sometimes also applied to Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" and \"La fanciulla del West\". Because only three \"verismo\" works not by Puccini continue to appear regularly on stage (the aforementioned \"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Andrea Chénier\"), Puccini's contribution has had lasting significance to the genre.\n\nSome authors have attempted to trace the origins of \"verismo\" opera to works that preceded Cavalleria rusticana, such as Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\", or Giuseppe Verdi's \"La traviata\". Modest Moussorgsky's Boris Godonov should not be ignored as an antecedent of \"verismo\", especially because of Moussorgsky's focus on peasants, alongside princes and other aristocracy and church leaders, and his deliberate relating of the natural speech inflexions of the libretto to the rhythms of the sung music, different from, for example, Tchaikovsky's use of Pushkin's verse as a libretto.\n\nThe \"verismo\" opera style featured music that required more declamatory singing, in contrast to the traditional tenets of elegant, 19th century bel canto singing that had preceded the movement. Opera singers adapted to the demands of the new style. The most extreme exponents of \"verismo\" vocalism sang habitually in a vociferous fashion, often forfeiting legato to focus on the passionate aspect of the music. They would 'beef up' the timbre of their voices, use excessive amounts of vocal fold mass on their top notes, and often employ a conspicuous vibrato in order to accentuate the emotionalism of their ardent interpretations. The results could be exciting in the theatre but such a strenuous mode of singing was not a recipe for vocal longevity. Some prominent practitioners of full-throttle \"verismo\" singing during the movement's Italian lifespan (circa 1890 to circa 1930) include the sopranos Eugenia Burzio, Lina Bruna Rasa and Bianca Scacciati, the tenors Aureliano Pertile, Cesar Vezzani and Amadeo Bassi, and the baritones Mario Sammarco and Eugenio Giraldoni. Their method of singing can be sampled on numerous 78-rpm gramophone recordings. See Michael Scott's two-volume survey \"The Record of Singing\", published in London by Duckworth in 1977/79, for an evaluation of most of these singers, and others of their ilk, and a discussion of the adverse impact that \"verismo\" music had on singing standards in Italy.\n\nSuch great early-20th century international operatic stars as Enrico Caruso, Rosa Ponselle and Titta Ruffo developed vocal techniques which harmoniously managed to combine fundamental bel canto precepts with a more 'modern', straightforward mode of ripe-toned singing when delivering \"verismo\" music, and their example has influenced operatic performers down to this day (see Scott).\n\n"}

{"id": "307372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307372", "title": "Mīmāṃsā", "text": "Mīmāṃsā\n\nMīmāṃsā (Sanskrit: मीमांसा) is a Sanskrit word that means \"reflection\" or \"critical investigation\" and thus refers to a tradition of contemplation which reflected on the meanings of certain Vedic texts. This tradition is also known as Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā because of its focus on the earlier (\"pūrva\") Vedic texts dealing with ritual actions, and similarly as Karma-Mīmāṃsā due to its focus on ritual action (\"karma\"). It is one of six Vedic \"affirming\" (āstika) schools of Hinduism. This particular school is known for its philosophical theories on the nature of dharma, based on hermeneutics of the Vedas, especially the Brāḥmanas and Saṃhitas. The Mīmāṃsā school was foundational and influential for the vedāntic schools, which were also known as Uttara-Mīmāṃsā for their focus on the \"later\" (\"uttara\") portions of the Vedas, the Upaniṣads. While both \"earlier\" and \"later\" Mīmāṃsā investigate the aim of human action, they do so with different attitudes towards the necessity of ritual praxis.\n\nMīmāṃsā has several sub-schools, each defined by its epistemology. The Prābhākara sub-school, which takes its name from the seventh-century philosopher Prabhākara, described the five epistemically reliable means to gaining knowledge: \"pratyakṣa\" or perception; \"anumāna\" or inference; \"upamāṇa\", by comparison and analogy; \"arthāpatti\", the use of postulation and derivation from circumstances; and \"śabda\", the word or testimony of past or present reliable experts. The Bhāṭṭa sub-school, from philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, added a sixth means to its canon; \"anupalabdhi\" meant non-perception, or proof by the absence of cognition (e.g., the \"lack\" of gunpowder on a suspect's hand)\n\nThe school of Mīmāṃsā consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines, but the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of Gods. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, and focused on the epistemology and metaphysics of \"dharma\". For the Mīmāṃsā school, \"dharma\" meant rituals and social duties, not \"devas\", or gods, because gods existed only in name. The Mīmāṃsakas also held that Vedas are \"eternal, author-less, [and] infallible\", that Vedic \"vidhi\", or injunctions and mantras in rituals are prescriptive \"kārya\" or actions, and the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upaniṣads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality as subsidiary, a philosophical view that Vedānta disagreed with.\n\nMīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language. While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools of Hinduism, their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsakas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly \"prescribe\" the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedāntins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also \"describe\", \"develop\" and \"derive\". Mīmāṃsakas considered orderly, law driven, procedural life as central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end.\n\nThe Mīmāṃsā school is a form of philosophical realism. A key text of the Mīmāṃsā school is the Mīmāṃsā Sūtra of Jaimini.\n\nMīmāṃsā, also romanized Mimansa or Mimamsa, means \"reflection, consideration, profound thought, investigation, examination, discussion\" in Sanskrit. It also refers to the \"examination of the Vedic text\" and to a school of Hindu philosophy that is also known as (\"prior\" inquiry, also ), in contrast to (\"posterior\" inquiry, also ) – the opposing school of Vedanta. This division is based on classification of the Vedic texts into ', the early sections of the Veda treating of mantras and rituals (Samhitas and Brahmanas), and the ' dealing with the meditation, reflection and knowledge of Self, Oneness, Brahman (the Upaniṣads). Between the \"Samhitas\" and \"Brahmanas\", the Mīmāṃsā school places greater emphasis to the Brahmanas - the part of Vedas that is a commentary on Vedic rituals.\n\nDonald Davis translates Mīmāṃsā as the \"desire to think\", and in colloquial historical context as \"how to think and interpret things\". In the last centuries of the first millennium BCE, the word Mīmāṃsā began to denote the thoughts on and interpretation of the Vedas, first as \"Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā\" for rituals portions in the earlier layers of texts in the Vedas, and as \"Uttara-Mīmāṃsā\" for the philosophical portions in the last layers. Over time, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā was just known as the Mīmāṃsā school, and the Uttara-Mīmāṃsā as the Vedanta school.\n\nMīmāṃsā scholars are referred to as \"Mīmāṃsāka\"s.\n\nMīmānsā is one of the six classical Hindu \"darśanas\". It is among the earliest schools of Hindu philosophies. It has attracted relatively less scholarly study, although its theories and particularly its questions on exegesis and theology have been highly influential on all classical Indian philosophies. Its analysis of language has been of central importance to the legal literature of India.\n\nAncient Mīmānsā's central concern was epistemology (\"pramana\"), that is what are the reliable means to knowledge. It debated not only \"how does man ever learn or know, whatever he knows\", but also whether the nature of all knowledge is inherently circular, whether those such as foundationalists who critique the validity of any \"justified beliefs\" and knowledge system make flawed presumptions of the very premises they critique, and how to correctly interpret and avoid incorrectly interpreting dharma texts such as the Vedas. It asked questions such as \"what is \"devata\" (god)?\", \"are rituals dedicated to \"devatas\" efficacious?\", \"what makes anything efficacious?\", and \"can it be proved that the Vedas, or any canonical text in any system of thought, fallible or infallible (\"svatah pramanya\", intrinsically valid)?, if so, how?\" and others. To Mīmānsā scholars, the nature of non-empirical knowledge and human means to it are such that one can never demonstrate certainty, one can only falsify knowledge claims, in some cases. According to Francis Clooney, a professor at Harvard Divinity School specializing on Hinduism, the Mīmānsā school is \"one of the most distinctively Hindu forms of thinking; it is without real parallel elsewhere in the world\".\n\nThe central text of the Mīmānsā school is Jamini's \"Mīmānsā Sutras\", along with the historically influential commentaries on this sutra by Sabara and by Kumarila Bhatta. Together, these texts develop and apply the rules of language analysis (such as the rules of contradiction), asserting that one must not only examine injunctive propositions in any scripture, but also examine the alternate related or reverse propositions for better understanding. They suggested that to reach correct and valid knowledge it is not only sufficient to demand proof of a proposition, it is important to give proof of a proposition's negative as well as declare and prove one's own preferred propositions. Further, they asserted that whenever perception is not the means of direct proof and knowledge, one cannot prove such non-empirical propositions to be \"true or not true\", rather one can only prove a non-empirical proposition is \"false, not false, or uncertain\".\n\nFor example, Mīmānsākas welcome not only the demand for proof of an injunctive proposition such as \"agnihotra ritual leads one to heaven\", but suggest that one must examine and prove alternate propositions such as \"ritual does not lead one to heaven\", \"something else leads one to heaven\", \"there is heaven\", \"there is no heaven\" and so on. Mīmānsā literature states that if satisfactory, verifiable proof for all of such propositions cannot be found by its proponents and its opponents, then the proposition needs to be accepted as a part of a \"belief system\". Beliefs, such as those in the scriptures (Vedas), must be accepted to be true unless its opponents can demonstrate the proof of validity of their own texts or teacher(s) these opponents presume to be \"prima facie justified\", and until these opponents can demonstrate that the scriptures they challenge are false. If they do not try to do so, it is hypocrisy; if they try to do so, it can only lead to infinite regress, according to Mīmānsākas. Any historic scripture with widespread social acceptance, according to Mīmānsāka, is an activity of communication (\"vyavaharapravrtti\") and is accepted as authoritative because it is socially validated practice, unless perceptually verifiable evidence emerges that proves parts or all of it as false or harmful.\n\nMīmānsākas were predominantly concerned with the central motivation of human beings, the highest good, and actions that make this possible. They stated that human beings seek \"niratisaya priti\" (unending ecstatic pleasure, joy, happiness) in this life and the next. They argued that this highest good is the result of one's own ethical actions (\"dharma\"), that such actions are what the Vedic sentences contain and communicate, and therefore it important to properly interpret and understand Vedic sentences, words and meaning. Mīmānsā scholarship was centrally concerned with the philosophy of language, how human beings learn and communicate with each other and across generations with language in order to act in a manner that enables them to achieve that which motivates them. The Mīmānsā school focussed on \"dharma\", deriving ethics and activity from the \"karma-kanda\" (rituals) part of the Vedas, with the argument that ethics for this life and efficacious action for \"svarga\" (heaven) cannot be derived from sense-perception, and can only be derived from experience, reflection and understanding of past teachings.\n<poem>\nIn every human activity, the motivating force to perform an action is his innate longing for \"priti\" (pleasure, happiness),\nwhether at the lowest level or the highest level.\nAt the highest level, it is nothing but an unsurpassed state of \"priti\",\nwhich is ensured only by performing ethical actions.\n</poem>\n– Sabara, 2nd century Mīmānsā scholar\nAccording to Daniel Arnold, Mīmānsā scholarship has \"striking affinities\" with that of William Alston, the 20th century Western philosopher, along with some notable differences. The Mīmānsākas subjected to a radical critique, more than two thousand years ago, states Francis Clooney, the notions such as \"God,\" the \"sacred text,\" the \"author\" and the \"anthropocentric ordering of reality\".\n\nIn the field of epistemology, later Mīmāṃsākas made some notable contributions. Unlike the Nyaya or the Vaisheshika systems, the sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes five means of valid knowledge (Skt. \"pramāṇa\"). The sub-school of Mīmāṃsā recognizes one additional sixth, namely \"anuapalabdhi\", just like Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. These six epistemically reliable means of gaining knowledge are:\n\nMain article : Pratyaksha\n\n\"Pratyakṣa\" (प्रत्यक्ष्य) means perception. It is of two types in Mīmānsā and other schools of Hinduism: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind. The ancient and medieval Indian texts identify four requirements for correct perception: \"Indriyarthasannikarsa\" (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), \"Avyapadesya\" (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), \"Avyabhicara\" (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and \"Vyavasayatmaka\" (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). Some ancient scholars proposed \"unusual perception\" as \"pramana\" and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included \"pratibha\" (intuition), \"samanyalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and \"jnanalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state). Further, some schools of Hinduism considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from \"Pratyakṣa-pramana\", so as to contrast \"nirnaya\" (definite judgment, conclusion) from \"anadhyavasaya\" (indefinite judgment).\n\nMain article : Anumana\n\n\"Anumāṇa\" (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of \"Anumana\". In all except one Hindu philosophies, this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: \"pratijna\" (hypothesis), \"hetu\" (a reason), and \"drshtanta\" (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: \"sadhya\" (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and \"paksha\" (the object on which the \"sadhya\" is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if \"sapaksha\" (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if \"vipaksha\" (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand \"Vyapti\" - the requirement that the \"hetu\" (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both \"sapaksha\" and \"vipaksha\". A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a \"nigamana\" (conclusion).\n\nMain article : Upamāṇa\n\n\"Upamāṇa\" means comparison and analogy. Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge. \"Upamana\", states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveller who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called \"upameyam\", the object of comparison is called \"upamanam\", while the attribute(s) are identified as \"samanya\". Thus, explains Monier Monier-Williams, if a boy says \"her face is like the moon in charmingness\", \"her face\" is \"upameyam\", the moon is \"upamanam\", and charmingness is \"samanya\". The 7th century text Bhaṭṭikāvya in verses 10.28 through 10.63 discusses many types of comparisons and analogies, identifying when this epistemic method is more useful and reliable, and when it is not. In various ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, 32 types of \"Upanama\" and their value in epistemology are debated.\n\n\"Arthāpatti\" (अर्थापत्ति) means postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this \"pramāṇa\" is similar to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this \"pramāṇa\" as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. Another common example for \"arthāpatti\" found in the texts of Mīmāṃsā and other schools of Hinduism is, that if \"Devadatta is fat\" and \"Devadatta does not eat in day\", then the following must be true: \"Devadatta eats in the night\". This form of postulation and deriving from circumstances is, claim the Indian scholars, a means to discovery, proper insight and knowledge. The Hindu schools that accept this means of knowledge state that this method is a valid means to conditional knowledge and truths about a subject and object in original premises or different premises. The schools that do not accept this method, state that postulation, extrapolation and circumstantial implication is either derivable from other \"pramāṇas\" or flawed means to correct knowledge, instead one must rely on direct perception or proper inference.\n\nMain article : Anupalabdhi, See also: Abhava\n\n\"Anupalabdi\" (अनुपलब्धि), accepted only by Kumarila Bhatta sub-school of Mīmāṃsā, means non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. \"Anupalabdhi pramana\" suggests that knowing a negative, such as \"there is no jug in this room\" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In the two schools of Hinduism that consider \"Anupalabdhi\" as epistemically valuable, a valid conclusion is either \"sadrupa\" (positive) or \"asadrupa\" (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other \"pramana\", Indian scholars refined \"Anupalabdi\" to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept \"non-perception\" as a \"pramana\". The schools that endorsed \"Anupalabdi\" affirmed that it as valid and useful when the other five \"pramanas\" fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.\n\n\"Abhava\" (अभाव) means non-existence. Some scholars consider \"Anupalabdi\" to be same as \"Abhava\", while others consider \"Anupalabdi\" and \"Abhava\" as different. \"Abhava-pramana\" has been discussed in ancient Hindu texts in the context of \"Padārtha\" (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A \"Padartha\" is defined as that which is simultaneously \"Astitva\" (existent), \"Jneyatva\" (knowable) and \"Abhidheyatva\" (nameable). Specific examples of \"padartha\", states Bartley, include \"dravya\" (substance), \"guna\" (quality), \"karma\" (activity/motion), \"samanya/jati\" (universal/class property), \"samavaya\" (inherence) and \"vishesha\" (individuality). \"Abhava\" is then explained as \"referents of negative expression\" in contrast to \"referents of positive expression\" in \"Padartha\". An absence, state the ancient scholars, is also \"existent, knowable and nameable\", giving the example of negative numbers, silence as a form of testimony, \"asatkaryavada\" theory of causation, and analysis of deficit as real and valuable. \"Abhava\" was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: \"dhvamsa\" (termination of what existed), \"atyanta-abhava\" (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), \"anyonya-abhava\" (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and \"pragavasa\" (prior, antecedent non-existence).\n\n\"Śabda\" (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains \"Sabda-pramana\" as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through \"Sabda\" (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the \"Sabda\" of reliable sources. The disagreement between the schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability. Some schools, such as Carvaka, state that this is never possible, and therefore \"Sabda\" is not a proper pramana. Other schools debate means to establish reliability.\n\nAn interesting feature of the Mīmāṃsā school of philosophy is its unique epistemological theory of the intrinsic validity of all cognition as such. It is held that all knowledge is \"ipso facto\" true (Skt. \"svataḥ prāmāṇyavāda\"). Thus, what is to be proven is not the truth of a cognition, but its falsity. The Mīmāṃsākas advocate the self-validity of knowledge both in respect of its origin (\"utpatti\") and ascertainment (\"jñapti\"). Not only did the Mīmāṃsākas make the very great use of this theory to establish the unchallengeable validity of the Vedas, but later Vedantists also drew freely upon this particular Mīmāṃsā contribution.\n\nThe core tenets of are ritualism (orthopraxy), anti-asceticism and anti-mysticism. The central aim of the school is elucidation of the nature of \"dharma\", understood as a set ritual obligations and prerogatives to be performed properly.\n\nMīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the \"mantras\" that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.\n\nDharma as understood by Pūrva Mīmāṃsā can be loosely translated into English as \"virtue\", \"morality\" or \"duty\". The Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school traces the source of the knowledge of dharma neither to sense-experience nor inference, but to verbal cognition (i.e. knowledge of words and meanings) according to Vedas. In this respect it is related to the Nyāya school, the latter, however, accepts only four sources of knowledge (\"pramāṇa\") as valid.\n\nThe Pūrva Mīmāṃsā school held dharma to be equivalent to following the prescriptions of the Saṃhitās and their Brāhmaṇa commentaries relating the correct performance of Vedic rituals. Seen in this light, Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is essentially ritualist (orthopraxy), placing great weight on the performance of karma or action as enjoined by the Vedas.\n\nEmphasis of Yajnic Karmakāṇḍas in Pūrva Mīmāṃsā is erroneously interpreted by some to be an opposition to Jñānakāṇḍa of Vedānta and Upaniṣads. Pūrva Mīmāṃsā does not discuss topics related to Jñānakāṇḍa, such as salvation (\"mokṣa\"), but it never speaks against mokṣa. Vedānta quotes Jaimini's belief in Brahman as well as in mokṣa:\n\nIn Uttara-Mīmāṃsā or Vedānta (4.4.5-7), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying (ब्राह्मेण जैमिनिरूपन्यासादिभ्यः) \"\"(The mukta Puruṣa is united with the Brahman) as if it were like the Brahman, because descriptions (in Śruti etc) prove so\"\".\n\nIn Vedānta (1.2.28), Bāḍarāyaṇa cites Jaimini as saying that \"There is no contradiction in taking Vaishvānara as the supreme Brahman\".\n\nIn 1.2.31, Jaimini is again quoted by Bāḍarāyana as saying that the nirguna (attribute-less) Brahman can manifest itself as having a form.\n\nIn 4.3.12, Bādarāyana again cites Jaimini as saying that the mukta Purusha attains Brahman.\n\nIn Pūrva Mīmāṃsā too, Jaimini emphasises the importance of faith in and attachment to the Omnipotent Supreme Being Whom Jaimini calls \"The Omnipotent Pradhaana\" (The Main):\n\nPūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1: \"sarvaśaktau pravṛttiḥ syāt tathābhūtopadeśāt\" (सर्वशक्तौ प्रवृत्तिः स्यात् तथाभूतोपदेशात्). The term \"upadeśa\" here means instructions of the śāstras as taught. We should tend towards the omnipotent supreme being. In the context of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā 6.3.1 shown above, next two sutras becomes significant, in which this Omnipotent Being is termed as \"pradhāna\", and keeping away from Him is said to be a \"doṣa\", hence all beings are asked to get related (\"abhisambandhāt\" in tadakarmaṇi ca doṣas tasmāt tato viśeṣaḥ syāt pradhānenābhisambandhāt; Jaimini 6, 3.3) to the \"Omnipotent Main Being\" (api vāpy ekadeśe syāt pradhāne hy arthanirvṛttir guṇamātram itarat tadarthatvāt; Jaimini 6, 3.2). Karma-Mīmāṃsā supports the Vedas, and Rgveda says that one Truth is variously named by the sages. It is irrelevant whether we call Him as Pradhāna or Brahman or Vaishvānara or Shiva or God.\n\nThe school's origins lie in the scholarly traditions of the final centuries BCE, when the priestly ritualism of Vedic sacrifice was being marginalized by Buddhism and Vedanta. To counteract this challenge, several groups emerged dedicated to demonstrating the validity of the Vedic texts by rigid formulation of rules for their interpretation. The school gathers momentum in the Gupta period with Śābara, and reaches its apex in the 7th to 8th centuries with and Prabhākara.\n\nThe school for some time in the Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought, and is credited as a major force contributing to the decline of Buddhism in India, but it has fallen into decline in the High Middle Ages and today is all but eclipsed by Vedanta.\n\nThe foundational text for the Mīmāṃsā school is the Purva Mīmāṃsā Sutras of Jaimini (ca. 5th to 4th century BCE). A major commentary was composed by Śābara in ca. the 5th or 6th century CE. The school reaches its height with and (fl. ca. 700 CE). Both Kumarila Bhatta and Prabhākara (along with , whose work is no more extant) have written extensive commentaries on Śābara's Mīmāṃsāsūtrabhāṣyam.\nKumārila Bhaṭṭa, Mandana Miśra, Pārthasārathi Miśra, Sucarita Miśra, Ramakrishna Bhatta, Madhava Subhodini, Sankara Bhatta, Krsnayajvan, Anantadeva, Gaga Bhatta, Ragavendra Tirtha, VijayIndhra Tirtha, Appayya Dikshitar, Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri, Mahomahapadyaya Sri Ramsubba Sastri, Sri Venkatsubba Sastri, Sri A. Chinnaswami Sastri, Sengalipuram Vaidhyanatha Dikshitar were some of Mīmānsā scholars.\n\nThe ' of Jaimini (c. 3rd century BCE) has summed up the general rules of ' for Vedic interpretation.

{"id": "308198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308198", "title": "Code name", "text": "Code name\n\nA code name or cryptonym is a word or name used, sometimes clandestinely, to refer to another name, word, project or person. Names are often used for military purposes, or in espionage. They may also be used in industrial counter-industrial espionage to protect secret projects and the like from business rivals, or to give names to projects whose marketing name has not yet been determined. Another reason for the use of names and phrases in the military is that they transmit with a lower level of cumulative errors over a walkie-talkie or radio link than actual names.\n\nDuring World War I, names common to the Allies referring to nations, cities, geographical features, military units, military operations, diplomatic meetings, places, and individual persons were agreed upon, adapting pre-war naming procedures in use by the governments concerned. In the British case names were administered and controlled by the Inter Services Security Board (ISSB) staffed by the War Office. This procedure was coordinated with the United States when America entered the war. Random lists of names were issued to users in alphabetical blocks of ten words and were selected as required. Words became available for re-use after six months and unused allocations could be reassigned at discretion and according to need. Judicious selection from the available allocation could result in clever meanings and result in an aptronym or backronym, although policy was to select words that had no obviously deducible connection with what they were supposed to be concealing. Those for the major conference meetings had a partial naming sequence referring to devices or instruments which had an ordinal number as part of their meaning, e.g., the third meeting was \"TRIDENT\". Joseph Stalin, whose last name means \"man of steel\", was given the name \"GLYPTIC\", meaning \"an image carved out of stone\".\n\n\nEwen Montagu, a British Naval intelligence officer, discloses in \"Beyond Top Secret Ultra\" that during World War II, Nazi Germany habitually used \"ad hoc\" code names as nicknames which often openly revealed or strongly hinted at their content or function.\n\nSome German code names:\n\n\nConversely, Operation Wacht am Rhein (Watch on the Rhine) was deliberately named to suggest the opposite of its purpose a defensive \"watch\" as opposed to a massive blitzkrieg operation, just as was Operation Weserübung (Weser-exercise), which signified the plans to invade Norway and Denmark in April 1940.\n\nBritain and the United States developed the security policy of assigning code names intended to give no such clues to the uninitiated. For example, the British counter measures against the V-2 was called \"Operation Crossbow\". The atomic bomb project centered in New Mexico was called the Manhattan Project, derived from the Manhattan Engineer District which managed the program. The code name for the American A-12 / SR-71 spy plane project, producing the fastest, highest-flying aircraft in the world, was \"Oxcart\". The American group that planned that country's first ICBM was called the Teapot Committee.\n\nAlthough the word could stand for a menace to shipping (in this case, that of Japan), the American code name for the attack on the subtropical island of Okinawa in World War II was \"Operation Iceberg\". The Soviet Union's project to base missiles in Cuba was named \"Operation Anadyr\" after their closest bomber base to the US (just across the Bering Strait from Nome, Alaska). The names of colors are generally avoided in American practice to avoid confusion with meteorological reporting practices. Britain, in contrast, made deliberately non-meaningful use of them, through the system of rainbow codes.\n\nAlthough German and Italian aircraft were not given code names by their Allied opponents, in 1942, Captain Frank T. McCoy, an intelligence officer of the USAAF, invented a system for the identification of Japanese military aircraft. Initially using short, \"hillbilly\" boys' names such as \"Pete\", \"Jake\", and \"Rufe\", the system was later extended to include girls' names and names of trees and birds, and became widely used by the Allies throughout the Pacific theater of war. This type of naming scheme differs from the other use of code names in that it does not have to be kept secret, but is a means of identification where the official nomenclature is unknown or uncertain.\n\nThe policy of recognition reporting names was continued into the Cold War for Soviet, other Warsaw Pact, and Communist Chinese aircraft. Although this was started by the Air Standards Co-ordinating Committee (ASCC) formed by the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, it was extended throughout NATO as the NATO reporting name for aircraft, rockets and missiles. These names were considered by the Soviets as being like a nickname given to one's unit by the opponents in a battle, such as the U.S. Marines were called by the Germans in France \"Devil Dogs\", which they appreciated as a feather in their cap. The Soviets did not like the Sukhoi Su-25 getting the code name \"Frogfoot\". However, some names were appropriate, such as \"Condor\" for the Antonov An-124, or, most famously, \"Fulcrum\" for the Mikoyan MiG-29, which had a \"pivotal\" role in Soviet air-strategy.\n\nCode names were adopted by the following process. Aerial or space reconnaissance would note a new aircraft at a Warsaw Pact airbase. The intelligence units would then assign it a code name consisting of the official abbreviation of the base, then a letter, for example, \"Ram-A\", signifying an aircraft sighted at Ramenskoye Airport. Missiles were given designations like \"TT-5\", for the fifth rocket seen at Tyura-Tam. When more information resulted in knowing a bit about what a missile was used for, it would be given a designation like \"SS-6\", for the sixth surface-to-surface missile design reported. Finally, when either an aircraft or a missile was able to be photographed with a hand-held camera, instead of a reconnaissance aircraft, it was given a name like \"Flanker\" or \"Scud\" always an English word, as international pilots worldwide are required to learn English. The Soviet manufacturer or designation – which may be mistakenly inferred by NATO – has nothing to do with it.\n\nJet-powered aircraft received two-syllable names like Foxbat, while propeller aircraft were designated with short names like Bull. Fighter names began with an \"F\", bombers with a \"B\", cargo aircraft with a \"C\". Training aircraft and reconnaissance aircraft were grouped under the word \"miscellaneous\", and received \"M\". The same convention applies to missiles, with air-launched ground attack missiles beginning with the letter \"K\" and surface-to-surface missiles (ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to antitank rockets) with the letter \"S\", air-to-air missiles \"A\", and surface-to-air missiles \"G\".\n\nThroughout the Second World War, the British allocation practice favored one-word code names (Jubilee, Frankton). That of the Americans favored longer compound words, although the name Overlord was personally chosen by Winston Churchill himself. Many examples of both types can be cited, as can exceptions.\n\nWinston Churchill was particular about the quality of code names. He insisted that code words, especially for dangerous operations, would be not overly grand nor petty nor common. One emotional goal he mentions is to never have to report to anyone that their son \"was killed in an operation called 'Bunnyhug' or 'Ballyhoo'.\"\n\nPresently, British forces tend to use one-word names, presumably in keeping with their post-World War II policy of reserving single words for operations and two-word names for exercises. British operation code names are usually randomly generated by a computer and rarely reveal its components or any political implications unlike the American names (e.g., the 2003 invasion of Iraq was called \"Operation Telic\" compared to Americans' \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\", obviously chosen for propaganda rather than secrecy). Americans prefer two-word names, whereas the Canadians and Australians use either. The French military currently prefer names drawn from nature (such as colors or the names of animals), for instance \"Opération Daguet\" (\"brocket deer\") or \"Opération Baliste\" (\"Triggerfish\"). The CIA uses alphabetical prefixes to designate the part of the agency supporting an operation.\n\nIn many cases with the United States, the first word of the name has to do with the intent of the program. Programs with \"have\" as the first word, such as Have Blue for the stealth fighter development, are developmental programs, not meant to produce a production aircraft. Programs that start with Senior, such as Senior Trend for the F-117, are for aircraft in testing meant to enter production.\n\nIn the United States code names are commonly set entirely in upper case. This is not done in other countries, though for the UK in British documents the code name is in upper case while operation is shortened to OP e.g., \"Op. TELIC\".\n\nThis presents an opportunity for a bit of public-relations (Operation Just Cause), or for controversy over the naming choice (Operation Infinite Justice, renamed Operation Enduring Freedom). Computers are now used to aid in the selection. And further, there is a distinction between the \"secret\" names during former wars and the \"published\" names of recent ones.\n\nA project code name is a code name (usually a single word, short phrase or acronym) which is given to a project being developed by industry, academia, government, and other concerns.\n\nProject code names are typically used for several reasons:\n\n\nDifferent organizations have different policies regarding the use and publication of project code names. Some companies take great pains to \"never\" discuss or disclose project code names outside of the company (other than with outside entities who have a need to know, and typically are bound with a non-disclosure agreement). Other companies never use them in official or formal communications, but widely disseminate project code names through informal channels (often in an attempt to create a marketing buzz for the project). Still others (such as Microsoft) discuss code names publicly, and routinely use project code names on beta releases and such, but remove them from final product(s). At the other end of the spectrum, Apple Computer includes the project code names for Mac OS X as part of the official name of the final product, a practice that was started in 2002 with Mac OS X v10.2 \"Jaguar\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly 1,000 years. For centuries, Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies. Music from Azerbaijan has a branch mode system, where chromatisation of major and minor scales is of great importance.\n\nIn 1920, Azerbaijani classical music had undergone a renaissance and Baku Academy of Music was founded to give classical musicians the same support as folk musicians. Modern day advocates of Western classical music in Azerbaijani include Farhad Badalbeyli, Fidan Gasimova and Franghiz Alizadeh.\n\nThe emergence of opera and ballet in Azerbaijan is associated with the Imperial Russian and Soviet era of Azerbaijani history when Azerbaijani musicians became exposed to European music traditions first-hand. The very first documented performance of an opera in Baku took place in May 1889 when Alexey Verstovsky's opera \"Askold's grave\" was staged at a circus arena in Baku (on the site of the current Azerbaijan Carpet Museum building), accompanied by the folk choir of Dmitry Agrenev-Slavyanski. Beginning in 1900, opera troupes toured Baku on a yearly basis (except 1901 and 1913), featuring prominent singers of the time such as Natalia Ermolenko-Yuzhina and Antonina Nezhdanova.\n\nProminent Azerbaijani opera singers such as Bulbul, Shovkat Mammadova, Fatma Mukhtarova, Huseyngulu Sarabski, Hagigat Rzayeva, Rashid Behbudov, Rauf Atakishiyev, Muslim Magomayev, Lutfiyar Imanov, Fidan and Khuraman Gasimovas, Rubaba Muradova, Zeynab Khanlarova and many other singers gained world fame.\n\nMost songs recount stories of real life events and Azerbaijani folklore, or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets. Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals and special festivals.\n\nRegional folk music generally accompanies folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. The regional mood also affects the subject of the folk songs, e.g. folk songs from the Caspian Sea are lively in general and express the customs of the region. Songs about betrayal have an air of defiance about them instead of sadness, whereas the further south travelled in Azerbaijan the more the melodies resemble a lament.\n\nAs this genre is viewed as a music of the people, musicians in socialist movements began to adapt folk music with contemporary sounds and arrangements in the form of protest music.\n\nInstruments used in traditional Azeri music include the stringed instruments \"tar\" (skin faced lute), the \"kamancha\" (skin faced spike fiddle), the \"oud\", originally \"barbat\", and the \"saz\" (long necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument \"balaban\", the frame drum \"ghaval\", the cylindrical double faced drum \"nagara\" (\"davul\"), and the \"gosha nagara\" (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the \"garmon\" (small accordion), \"tutek\" (whistle flute), and \"daf\" (frame drum).\n\nDue to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the tutek has influenced various cultures in the Caucasus region, e.g. the duduks. The zurna and naghara duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations.\n\nAshiqs are travelling bards who sing and play the saz, a form of lute. Their songs are semi-improvised around a common base. This art is one of the symbols of Azerbaijani culture and considered an emblem of national identity and the guardian of Azerbaijani language, literature and music.\n\nCharacterized by the accompaniment of the kopuz, a stringed musical instrument, the classical repertoire of Azerbaijani Ashiqs includes 200 songs, 150 literary-musical compositions known as dastans, nearly 2,000 poems and numerous stories.\n\nSince 2009 the art of Azerbaijani Ashiqs has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nMeykhana is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject. Meykhana is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.\n\nMeykhana is often compared to hip hop music, also known as \"national rap\" among Azerbaijani residents, as it also includes performers that is spoken lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Performers also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Meykhana masters may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat.\n\nMugham is one of the many folk musical compositions from Azerbaijan, contrast with \"Tasnif\", \"Ashugs\". Mugam draws on Arabic maqam.\n\nIt is a highly complex art form that weds classical poetry and musical improvisation in specific local modes. Mugham is a modal system. Unlike Western modes, \"mugham\" modes are associated not only with scales but with an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic fragments that performers use in the course of improvisation. Mugham is a compound composition of many parts. The choice of a particular mugham and a style of performance fits a specific event. The dramatic unfolding in performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and initiated listeners.\n\nThree major schools of mugham performance existed from the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the region of Garabagh, Shirvan, and Baku. The town of Shusha of Karabakh was particularly renowned for this art.\n\nThe short selection of Azerbaijani mugham played in balaban, national wind instrument was included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft as representing world music, included among many cultural achievements of humanity.\n\nIn 2003, UNESCO proclaimed mugham as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nPopular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Azerbaijani musicality after the fall of the Soviet Union, either due to attempts of national modernization from 1918 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves.\n\nAzerbaijani pop music had its humble beginnings in the late 1950s with Azerbaijani cover versions of a wide range of imported popular styles, including rock and roll, tango, and jazz. As more styles emerged, they were also adopted, such as hip hop, heavy metal and reggae.\n\nAzerbaijani pop music reached new level after country made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The country's entry gained the third place in 2009 and fifth the following year. Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song \"Running Scared\", entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku.\n\nThe biggest pop stars in Azerbaijan are arguably Roya, Aygun Kazimova and Brilliant Dadashova.\n\nThe Azerbaijani jazz is a popular variety of jazz, widespread in Azerbaijan. It covers a broad range of styles (traditional, post-pop, fusion, free flexion) and often features a blend with traditional Azerbaijani music. Among modern famed Azeri jazz musicians are Aziza Mustafazadeh, who was influenced by Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett, Isfar Sarabski, Salman Gambarov and Rain Sultanov.\n\nThe first Azerbaijani hip-hop song \"Yesterday is Past\", created in 1983 by Chingiz Mustafayev, who would later become Azerbaijan's national hero for unrelated reasons.\nThe pioneer of Azerbaijani rap often associated with name of Anar Nagilbaz in 1992, which also included elements of disco but the popularity of the rap genre came with the rise of Dayirman, which included primarily patriotic elements.\n\nThe Azerbaijani rock scene began in the mid-to late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Azerbaijani fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Azerbaijani rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of Azerbaijani rock. Coldünya and Yuxu are the best known group of older classical Azerbaijani rock music.\n\nThere are many clubs across Azerbaijan, especially across its Baku region. The alternative music scene however is derived mostly from Baku's club scene that sees DJs merging the past with the present, utilising traditional motifs with new age sounds and electronic music.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "309909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=309909", "title": "Aristotelianism", "text": "Aristotelianism\n\nAristotelianism ( ) is a tradition of philosophy that takes its defining inspiration from the work of Aristotle. This school of thought, in the modern sense of philosophy, covers existence, ethics, mind and related subjects. In Aristotle's time, philosophy included natural philosophy, which preceded the advent of modern science during the Scientific Revolution. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the Peripatetic school and later on by the Neoplatonists, who produced many commentaries on Aristotle's writings. In the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna and Averroes translated the works of Aristotle into Arabic and under them, along with philosophers such as Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, Aristotelianism became a major part of early Islamic philosophy.\n\nMoses Maimonides adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his famous \"Guide for the Perplexed\" on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to western Europe, it was not until the Latin translations of the 12th century that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with Christian theology.\n\nAfter retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx. Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths. In this, they follow Heidegger's critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.\n\nRecent Aristotelian ethical and \"practical\" philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the \"res publica\", public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.\n\nThe most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is Alasdair MacIntyre. Especially famous for helping to revive virtue ethics in his book \"After Virtue\", MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He juxtaposes Aristotelianism with the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and with rival traditions — including the philosophies of Hume and Nietzsche — that reject Aristotle's idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimate capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is \"the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one.\" Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly \"revolutionary Aristotelianism\". This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr. in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.\n\nThe original followers of Aristotle were the members of the Peripatetic school. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were Theophrastus and Strato of Lampsacus, who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the Roman era the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work. The most important figure in this regard was Alexander of Aphrodisias who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of Neoplatonism in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end, but the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system, and produced many commentaries on Aristotle.\n\nByzantine Aristotelianism emerged in the Byzantine Empire in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by Michael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by Sophonias in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.\n\nLeo the Mathematician was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic. The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic. However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess Anna Comnena who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.\n\nIn the Abbasid Empire, many foreign works were translated into Arabic, large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed. Under the caliphs Harun al-Rashid and his son Al-Ma'mun, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad flourished. Christian scholar Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into Syriac and Arabic.\n\nWith the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the \"Eudemian Ethics\", \"Magna Moralia\" and \"Politics\") became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for Islamic Aristotelianism.\n\nAl-Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world. He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.\n\nThe philosopher Al-Farabi (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of \"the Second Teacher\"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Avicenna (980–1037). Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle. The school of thought he founded became known as Avicennism, which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.\n\nAt the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, during the reign of Al-Hakam II (961 to 976) in Córdoba, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. Averroes (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and Seville, was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified. Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the Latin West, and would lead to the school of thought known as Averroism.\n\nAlthough some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of Boethius's commentaries on the \"Organon\", and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, Isidore of Seville and Martianus Capella. From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.\n\nThe renaissance of the 12th century saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. James of Venice, who probably spent some years in Constantinople, translated Aristotle's \"Posterior Analytics\" from Greek into Latin in the mid-twelfth century, thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the \"Organon\", available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central Spain, which had come under Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the Latin translations of the 12th century. The most productive of these translators was Gerard of Cremona, (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books, which included many of the works of Aristotle such as his \"Posterior Analytics\", \"Physics\", \"On the Heavens\", \"On Generation and Corruption\", and \"Meteorology\". Michael Scot (c. 1175–1232) translated Averroes' commentaries on the scientific works of Aristotle.\n\nAristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly, and at a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for heterodoxy in the Condemnations of 1210–1277. In the first of these, in Paris in 1210, it was stated that \"neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication.\" However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270 the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.\n\nWilliam of Moerbeke (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the \"Politics\" (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the \"Alexandrian\" Aristotelianism of Averroes followed \"the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional Neoplatonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism\".\n\nAlbertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him. He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe. Magnus did not repudiate Plato. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the \"concordist tradition\", which sought to harmonize Aristotle with Plato through interpretation (see for example Porphyry's \"On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School\"). Magnus famously wrote:\n\nThomas Aquinas (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle. Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his moral philosophy. The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as Thomism, and was especially influential among the Dominicans, and later, the Jesuits.\n\nUsing Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as Marsilius of Padua's \"Defensor pacis\", 14th-century scholar Nicole Oresme translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensive comments on them.\n\nAfter retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as un-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx. Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths. In this, they follow Heidegger's critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.\n\nAristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories. Recent Aristotelian ethical and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the \"res publica\", public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.\n\nThe contemporary Aristotelian philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre is specially famous for helping to revive virtue ethics in his book \"After Virtue\". MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is \"the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one.\" Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr. in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.\n\nIn metaphysics, an Aristotelian realism about universals is defended by such philosophers as David Malet Armstrong and Stephen Mumford, and is applied to the philosophy of mathematics by James Franklin.\n\nBertrand Russell criticizes Aristotle's logic on the following points:\n\n\nIn addition, Russell ends his review of the Aristotelian logic with these words:\n\nI conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant. Any person in the present day who wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any of his disciples. Nonetheless, Aristotle's logical writings show great ability, and would have been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a time when intellectual originality was still active. Unfortunately, they appeared at the very end of the creative period of Greek thought, and therefore came to be accepted as authoritative. By the time that logical originality revived, a reign of two thousand years had made Aristotle very difficult to dethrone. Throughout modern times, practically every advance in science, in logic, or in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of the opposition from Aristotle's disciples.\n\n"}

The small amount of emulsifiers naturally found in butter are used to form an oil-in-water emulsion. Although similar to hollandaise in concept, it is considered neither a classic leading nor compound sauce. This sauce originates in Loire Valley cuisine.\n\nThe chef Clémence Lefeuvre (née Clémence Prau) invented \"beurre blanc\", apparently by accident, some time around the beginning of the 20th century. She served this sauce at her restaurant \"La Buvette de la Marine\" in the hamlet of La Chebuette in the village of Saint-Julien-de-Concelles on the banks of the Loire River a few kilometers upstream from Nantes.\n\nLegend holds that she intended to prepare a béarnaise sauce to go with pike, but forgot to add the tarragon and egg yolks. Some sources claim that this invention occurred while she worked as a cook for the Marquis de Goulaine at Château de Goulaine. Aristide Briand, long-time prime minister of France and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at her death in 1932 that it \"was a bit like national mourning\".\n\nA good \"beurre blanc\" is rich and buttery, with a neutral flavor that responds well to other seasonings and flavorings, thereby lending itself to the addition of herbs and spices. It should be light and airy yet still liquid and thick enough to cling to food.\n\n\"Beurre blanc\" is prepared by reducing wine, shallots, and herbs (if used) until it is nearly dry. Although not necessary, cream can be added at this point as a stabilizer to the sauce. Lemon juice is sometimes used in place of vinegar, and stock can be added, as well. Cold, one-inch cubes of butter are then gradually incorporated into the sauce as the butter melts and the mixture is whisked.\n\nThe sauce can separate by either overheating or cooling. If it heats past 58°C (136°F), some of the emulsifying proteins begin to break down and release the butterfat they hold in emulsion. If the sauce cools below 27°C (80°F), the butterfat will solidify.\n\n\"Beurre rouge\" (English: \"red butter\") is a variant of the \"beurre blanc\" sauce that is prepared by substituting a dry red wine for the white wine and red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar.\n\n"}

In 1965, it was acquired by Guinness, now part of Diageo. The Kilkenny brewery was shut down in 2013 and production of all Smithwick's and Kilkenny branded beers moved to Dublin; parts of the old brewery are now a \"visitor experience\".\n\nSmithwick's Brewery was founded by John Smithwick in 1710. The brewery is on the site of a Franciscan abbey, where monks had brewed ale since the 14th century, and ruins of the original abbey still remain on its grounds. The old brewery has since been renovated and now hosts \"The Smithwick's Experience Kilkenny\" visitor attraction and centre. At the time of its closure, it was Ireland's oldest operating brewery.\n\nJohn Smithwick was an orphan who had settled in Kilkenny. Shortly after his arrival, Smithwick went into the brewing business with Richard Cole on a piece of land that Cole had leased from the Duke of Ormond in 1705. Five years later, John Smithwick became the owner of the land. The brewery stayed small, servicing a loyal local following while John Smithwick diversified.\n\nFollowing John Smithwick's death, the brewery temporarily fell out of family hands. John Smithwick's great grandson, Edmond bought the brewery land back freehold and worked to reshape its future. Edmond concentrated on discovering new markets and successfully building export trade. Drinkers in England, Scotland and Wales developed a taste for Smithwick's brews and output increased fivefold.\n\nAs a result of substantial contributions made to St Mary's Cathedral, Edmond became great friends with Irish liberal Daniel O'Connell, who later became godfather to one of his sons. Edmond Smithwick became well known and respected by the people of Kilkenny who elected him town mayor four times.\n\nIn 1800, export sales began to fall and the brewing industry encountered difficulty. To combat this, the Smithwick family increased production in their maltings, began selling mineral water and delivered butter with the ale from the back of their drays. \n\nBy 1900, output was at an all-time low and the then owner James Smithwick was advised by auditors to shut the doors of the brewery. Instead, James reduced the range of beers they produced and set out to find new markets. He secured military contracts and soon after saw output increase again. James' son, Walter, took control in 1930 and steered the brewery to success through the hardships of both World War II and increasingly challenging weather conditions. By January 1950, Smithwick's was exporting ale to Boston.\n\nSmithwick's was purchased from Walter Smithwick in 1965 by Guinness and is now, along with Guinness, part of Diageo. Together, Guinness & Co. and Smithwick's developed and launched Smithwick's Draught Ale in 1966. By 1979, half a million barrels were sold each year.\n\nIn 1980, Smithwick's began exporting to France. In 1993, Smithwick's Draught became Canada's leading imported ale. \n\nBy 2010, Smithwick's continued to be brewed in Dundalk and Kilkenny with tankers sent to Dublin to be kegged for the on trade market. Cans and bottles were packaged by IBC in Belfast. \n\nProduction in the Kilkenny brewery finished on 31 December 2013 and Smithwicks brands are now produced in the Diageo St.James' Gate brewery in Dublin.\n\nThe original Kilkenny site was sold to Kilkenny County Council, with a small portion of the site dedicated to the opening of a visitor's centre, the \"Smithwick's Experience Kilkenny\".\n\nOfficial Smithwick's videos give the pronunciation as . Due to the differing accent and dialects of Ireland, it is generally pronounced , , or there but never or . When ordering in the US, or is preferred, while is the most prevalent pronunciation in Canada.\n\nIn the \"Old Kilkenny Review\", year unknown, Peter Smithwick, K.M., Solicitor, wrote that the tradition in Kilkenny is that Sullivan's Brewery was founded in 1702 by Daniel Sullivan, a Protestant, who bought property in trust for Pierse Bryan of Jenkinstown, a Catholic who was prohibited by the Penal Laws from buying land.

{"id": "311846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311846", "title": "Eparchy", "text": "Eparchy\n\nEparchy is an anglicized Greek word (), authentically Latinized as eparchia, which can be loosely translated as the rule or jurisdiction over something, such as a province, prefecture, or territory. It has specific meanings both in politics, history and in the hierarchy of the Eastern Christian churches.\n\nIn secular use, the word eparchy denotes an administrative district in the Roman / Byzantine Empire, or in modern Greece or Cyprus.\n\nIn ecclesiastical use, an eparchy is a territorial diocese governed by a bishop of one of the Eastern churches, who holds the title of eparch. It is part of a metropolis. Each eparchy is divided into parishes in the same manner as a diocese of western Christendom. In the Catholic Church, an archieparchy equivalent to an archdiocese of the Roman Rite and its bishop is an archieparch, equivalent to an archbishop of the Roman Rite.\n\nOriginally eparchy (ἐπαρχίᾱ, \"eparchia\") was the Greek equivalent of the Latin term \"provincia\", one of the districts of the Roman Empire. As such it was used, chiefly in the eastern parts of the Empire, to designate the Roman provinces. The term eparch (, \"eparchos\") however, designating an eparchy's governor, was most usually used to refer to the praetorian prefects (singular in Greek: , \"eparch of the praetorium\") in charge of the Empire's praetorian prefectures, and to the Eparch of Constantinople, the city's urban prefect. \n\nThe Dominate-period administrative system was retained In the Byzantine period of the Empire until the 7th century. As Greek became the Empire's main administrative language, replacing Latin, in the latter 6th century even the provinces of the Exarchate of Ravenna, in reconquered Italy, were termed \"eparchiae\" in Greek as well as in Latin.\n\nIn the latter half of the 7th century, the old provincial administration was replaced by the thematic system. Even after that however, the term \"eparchos\" remained in use until the 840s for the senior administrative official of each \"thema\", under the governing \"strategos\". Thereafter, eparchs are evident in some cases as city governors, but the most important by far amongst them was the Eparch of Constantinople, whose office had wide-ranging powers and functioned continuously until the 13th century.\n\nThe term \"eparchia\" was revived as one of the administrative sub-provincial units of post-Ottoman independent Greece, the country being divided into \"nomoi\" (\"Prefectures\"), of which in turn some were subdivided into \"eparchies\". From 1887, the \"eparchies\" were abolished as actual administrative units, but were retained for some state services, especially finance services and education, as well as for electoral purposes. Before the Second World War, there were 139 \"eparchies\", and after the war, with the addition of the Dodecanese Islands, their number grew to 147. The provinces were abolished in the mainland (but retained for the islands), in the wide-ranging administrative reform implemented in 1997 (the \"Kapodistrias Project\") and replaced by enlarged municipalities (\"demoi\").\n\nIn Cyprus, the term \"eparchia\" is used to refer to the Districts of Cyprus.\n\nThe Christian Church (before the split into Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox) adopted elements of political, administrative system of the late Roman Empire, as introduced by the reforms of Diocletian (284-305). Adopted elements included both organizational structure and terminology.\n\nNotwithstanding the primacies of the Apostolic Sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch, the bishoprics of each civil province were grouped in one ecclesiastical province, also called eparchy, under the supervision of the metropolitan, usually the bishop of the provincial capital. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 accepted this arrangement and orders that: \"the authority [of appointing bishops] shall belong to the metropolitan in each eparchy\" (can. iv), i.e., in each such civil eparchy (province) there shall be a metropolitan bishop who has authority over the others.\n\nSince the use of the term eparchy was originally linked to metropolitan rights, later in Eastern Christianity, after a process of title-inflation and multiplying the numbers of metropolitans by elevating local bishops to honorary metropolitan rank without giving them any real metropolitan powers, the use of the word \"eparchy\" was gradually modified and came to refer to dioceses of such \"metropolitan\" bishops, and later to dioceses in general. This process was initially promoted in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and later the new usage of term \"eparchy\" became prevalent in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the ancient Oriental Churches, and the Eastern Catholic Churches.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the name eparchy is not commonly used as the usual term for a diocese except in the Bulgarian, Czechoslovak, Russian, and Serbian Orthodox Churches. The Russian Orthodox Church in the early 20th century counted 86 eparchies, of which three (Kiev, Moscow, and St. Petersburg) were ruled by bishops who always bore the title \"Metropolitan.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "311973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311973", "title": "Kairos", "text": "Kairos\n\nKairos () is an Ancient Greek word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment. The ancient Greeks had two words for time: chronos () and kairos. The former refers to chronological or sequential time, while the latter signifies a proper or opportune time for action. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature. \"Kairos\" also means \"weather\" in Modern Greek. The plural, καιροί (\"kairoi\" (Ancient and Modern Greek)) means \"the times\". Kairos is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.\n\nIn Onians' 1951 etymological studies of the word, he traces the primary root back to the ancient Greek association with both archery and weaving. In archery, kairos denotes the moment in which an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, kairos denotes the moment in which the shuttle could be passed through threads on the loom.\n\nIn the literature of the classical period, writers and orators used kairos to specify moments when the opportune action was made, often through metaphors involving archery and one’s ability to aim and fire at the exact right time on-target. For example, in The Suppliants, a drama written by Euripides, Adrastus describes the ability to influence and change another person’s mind by “aiming their bow beyond the kairos.”\n\nKairos is also an alternate spelling of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.\n\nIn rhetoric, \"kairos\" is \"a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved.\"\n\nKairos was central to the Sophists, who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In \"Panathenaicus\", Isocrates writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action\".\n\nKairos is also very important in Aristotle's scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the proof will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: \"The Audience\", which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and \"To Prepon\", which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, \"kairos\" was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the Sophists, and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and Plato. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article \"Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric\", John Poulakos defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: \"Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible.\" Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. \nKairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that \"what is said must conform to both audience and occasion.\" Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. \nAristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his \"Rhetoric\", one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.\n\nKairos has classically been defined as a concept that focused on \"'the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.'\" Ancient Pythagoreans thought Kairos to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe. Kairos was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe. Empedocles was the philosopher who connect kairos to the principle of opposites and harmony. It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.\n\nIn his article \"Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric,\" Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.” He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, \"the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known\" or as, \"the opportune, spontaneous, or timely.\" Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.\nHess's conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment. However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction. Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.\n\nAccording to Bitzer, Kairos is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetors ability to influence, such as the audience’s personal beliefs and motivations.\n\nAdditionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action.\n\nThus, the difficulty of using kairos in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one’s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.\n\n'Kairos' modern English definition is vague. There is no one word in today's English language that completely encompasses the definition of kairos, similar to that of Ethos, Logos, and Pathos. In his article \"The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion,\" Michael Harker says, \"Like the 'points' on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of kairos is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument.\" Kairos' inclusion in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones. Various components of kairos are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.'\n\nKairos' purpose in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos. Kairos is used as a \"starting point\" in modern rhetoric. Kelly Pender's article \"'Kairos' and the Subject of Expressive Discourse\" states the inclusion of kairos within discourse \"would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer's experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation...\" Kairos is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.\n\nIn the New Testament, \"kairos\" means \"the appointed time in the purpose of God,\" the time when God acts (e.g. : the \"kairos\" is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). \"Kairos\" (used 86 times in the New Testament) refers to an opportune time, a \"moment\" or a \"season\" such as \"harvest time,\" whereas \"chronos\" (used 54 times) refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. and ). Jesus makes a distinction in between \"His\" time and \"His brothers'\" time: paradoxically, it is \"always\" () his brothers' time. In the context, they can go to Jerusalem any time they wish.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, before the Divine Liturgy begins, the Deacon exclaims to the Priest, 'Καιρὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ' (\"Kairos tou poiēsai tō Kyriō\"), i.e. \"It is time [\"kairos\"] for the Lord to act\", indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.\n\nIn \"The Interpretation of History,\" neo-orthodox Lutheran theologian Paul Tillich made prominent use of the term. For him, the \"kairoi\" are those crises in history (see Christian existentialism) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare Karl Barth's use of \"Geschichte\" as opposed to \"Historie\"). In the Kairos Document, an example of liberation theology in South Africa under apartheid, the term \"kairos\" is used to denote \"the appointed time,\" \"the crucial time\" into which the document or text is spoken.\n\nIn Hippocrates’ (460-357 B.C.E) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term “kairos” is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While “kairos” most often refers to “the right time,” Hippocrates also used to term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to “express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.” Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.\n\nHippocrates most famous quote about kairos is “every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.” \n\nIn \"A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy\" by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, Roger Dennis Cherry also discusses the art of kairos in the field of science. Citing John Swales, the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spacial aspect of kairos, or the creation of \"an opening,\" which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or kairos. Swales created what he called the \"create a research space\" model, wherein kairos, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves. 1.) establishing the field. 2.) summarizing previous research. 3.) preparing for present research, and 4.) introducing the present research. The third step is one where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because kairos emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.\n\nThis can easily be related back to Hippocrates statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes kairos.\n\nThe idea can also be expressed in the words of Carolyn M. Glasshoff who wrote that, specifically in the field of scientific writing, “any text must be influenced by the kairos that exists both before the text is created and during the presentation. In addition, each text helps create a new kairos for texts that come after.” \n\nThe historical context of the definition of kairos may make the concept appear outdated. However, the relevancy of kairos is at its peak as the world has rapidly transformed into a society dependent on digital technology. In order to recognize how kairos can be applied to online media and the challenges that occur as a result, a broad definition of the term is required. One definition makes the application of kairos to digital media easy to recognize, as it states kairos can be referred to as particular moment in which success is achieved when an opening is pursued with force. This definition prompts a main issue within the application of kairos to online content: if timing is crucial to the message of communication that is being received, how can we communicate effectively online, where anything can be published at any time?\n\nThe difficulty with modern rhetoric in the digital space is that the audience is less easily influenced by the rhetor. As such, it is difficult for rhetors to utilize kairos to the best of their abilities. Due to the nature of which modern audiences in the electronic age consume media, it is highly possible that they are multi-tasking, with their attention divided among multiple sources. This difficulty is compounded with the fact that this audience can consume discourse at different times, in different places, and through varying mediums. As a result, the audience is able to assign encountered discourse at various levels of personal priority. With this, they are able to discern which discourse they think is vital or interesting, and discard those they deem trivial or unworthy of their attention.\n\nThere are also multiple external factors that lead to the difficulty in using kairos in a modern setting. Since computer hardware, software, and even the underlying operating system all differ between people, it is difficult for the orator to take account for every permutation possible. Couple this with the lack of a true shared community online, since such virtual “cloakroom communities” are only temporary, and the difficulties in using kairos in the digital age becomes painfully clear.\n\nSome scholars studying kairos in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/ identity, distribution/ circulation, access/ accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information's use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "312320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312320", "title": "Garum", "text": "Garum\n\nGarum was a fermented fish sauce used as a condiment in the cuisines of ancient Greece, Rome, and later Byzantium. Liquamen was a similar preparation, and at times they were synonymous. Although it enjoyed its greatest popularity in the Roman world, it was earlier used by the Greeks.\n\nPliny the Elder and Isidore of Seville derive the Latin word \"garum\" from the Greek γαρός (\"garos\"), a food named by Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Aeschylus. Garos may have been a type of fish, or a fish sauce similar to garum. Pliny stated that garum was made from fish intestines, with salt, creating a liquor, the garum, and a sediment named (h)allec or allex. A concentrated garum evaporated down to a thick paste with salt crystals was called muria; it would have been used to salt and flavor foods.\n\nLike the modern fermented soy product soy sauce, fermented garum is rich in monosodium glutamate, a source of umami flavoring. It was used along with murri in medieval Byzantine and Arab cuisine to give a savory flavor to dishes. Murri may well derive from garum.\n\nGarum was produced in various grades consumed by all social classes. After the liquid was ladled off of the top of the mixture, the remains of the fish, called \"allec\", was used by the poorest classes to flavour their staple porridge or farinata. The finished product—the \"nobile garum\" of Martial's epigram—was apparently mild and subtle in flavor. The best garum fetched extraordinarily high prices, and salt could be substituted for it in a simpler dish. Garum appears in many recipes featured in the Roman cookbook \"Apicius\". For example, Apicius (8.6.2–3) gives a recipe for lamb stew, calling for the meat to be cooked with onion and coriander, pepper, lovage, cumin, \"liquamen\", oil, and wine, then thickened with flour.\n\nIn the first century AD, \"liquamen\" was a sauce distinct from \"garum\", as indicated throughout the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\" IV. By the fifth century or earlier, however, \"liquamen\" had come to refer to \"garum\". The available evidence suggests that the sauce was typically made by crushing the innards of (fatty) pelagic fishes, particularly anchovies, but also sprats, sardines, mackerel, or tuna, and then fermenting them in brine. In most surviving \"tituli picti\" inscribed on amphorae, where the fish ingredient is shown, the fish is mackerel. Under the best conditions, the fermentation process took about 48 hours. \n\nThe manufacture and export of garum was an element of the prosperity of coastal Greek emporia from the Ligurian coast of Gaul to the coast of Hispania Baetica, and perhaps an impetus for Roman penetration of these coastal regions.\n\nPliny the Elder spoke of a type of higher quality garum that Roman Jews may have used, as normal garum would not have been considered kosher.\n\nIn the ruins of Pompeii, jars were found containing \"kosher garum\", suggesting an equal popularity among Jews there. Each port had its own traditional recipe, but by the time of Augustus, Romans considered the best to be garum from Cartagena and Gades in Baetica.\n\nThis product was called \"garum sociorum\", \"garum of the allies\". The ruins of a garum factory remain at the Baetian site of Baelo Claudia (in present-day Tarifa) and Carteia (San Roque). Other sites are a large garum factory at Gades (Cadiz) and at Málaga under the Picasso museum.\n\nGarum was a major export product from Hispania to Rome, and gained the towns a certain amount of prestige. The garum of Lusitania (in present-day Portugal) was also highly prized in Rome, and was shipped directly from the harbour of Lacobriga (Lagos). A former Roman garum factory can be visited in the Baixa area of central Lisbon. Fossae Marianae in southern Gaul, located on the southern tip of present-day France, served as a distribution hub for Western Europe, including Gaul, Germania, and Roman Britain.\n\nUmbricius Scaurus' production of garum was key to the economy of Pompeii. The factories where garum was produced in Pompeii have not been uncovered, perhaps indicating that they lay outside the walls of the city. The production of garum created such unpleasant smells that factories were generally relegated to the outskirts of cities. In 2008, archaeologists used the residue from garum found in containers in Pompeii to confirm the August date of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The garum had been made entirely of bogues, fish that congregate in the summer months.\n\nWhen mixed with wine (\"oenogarum\", a popular Byzantine sauce), vinegar, black pepper, or oil, garum enhances the flavor of a wide variety of dishes, including boiled veal and steamed mussels, even pear-and-honey soufflé. Diluted with water (\"hydrogarum\") it was distributed to Roman legions. Pliny (d. 79) remarked in his \"Natural History\" that it could be diluted to the colour of honey wine and drunk.\n\n\"Garum\" had a social dimension that might be compared to that of garlic in some modern Western societies, or to the adoption of fish sauce in Vietnamese cuisine (called \"nước mắm\" there). Seneca, holding the old-fashioned line against the expensive craze, cautioned against it, even though his family was from Baetian Corduba:\n\nA surviving fragment of Plato Comicus speaks of \"putrid garum\". Martial congratulates a friend on keeping up amorous advances to a girl who had indulged in six helpings of it.\n\nGarum was also employed as a medicine. It was thought to be one of the best cures for many ailments, including dog bites, dysentery, and ulcers, and to ease chronic diarrhea and treat constipation. Garum was even used as an ingredient in cosmetics and for removal of unwanted hair and freckles.\n\nThe biological anthropologist Piers Mitchell suggests that garum may have helped spread fish tapeworms across Europe.\n\nGarum is believed to be the ancestor of the fermented anchovy sauce \"colatura di alici\", still produced in Campania, Italy. Worcestershire sauce is a savory sauce based upon fermented anchovies and other ingredients. Ketchup, originally a savory fish sauce that did not contain either sugar or tomatoes, shared its origins, culinary functions and popularity with garum.\n\nGarum remains of interest to food historians and chefs, and has been reintroduced into modern food preparation. In Southeast Asia, fish sauce is a distinctive element of that region's cuisine, used similarly as garum was in Rome. In Cádiz, Spain, in 2017, one chef used its flavors for a fish salad recipe, after Spanish archaeologists found evidence of garum in amphoras recovered in the ruins of Pompeii, dating to 79 AD.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "312506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312506", "title": "Muffin", "text": "Muffin\n\nA muffin is an individual-sized, baked product. It can refer to two distinct items, a part-raised flatbread and a cupcake-like quickbread.\nThe flatbread is of British or European derivation, and dates from at least the early 18th century, while the quickbread originated in North America during the 19th century. Both are common worldwide today.\n\nQuickbread muffins (known in Britain as \"American muffins\" or simply as \"muffins\") originated in the United States in the mid-19th century. The use of the term to describe what are essentially cup cakes or buns did not become common usage in Britain until the last decades of the 20th century on the back of the spread of coffee shops such as Starbucks. (There is lingering resistance in the UK to the term as being inapplicable to cakes.) They are similar to cupcakes in size and cooking methods, the main difference being that cupcakes tend to be sweet desserts using cake batter and which are often topped with sugar icing (American frosting). Muffins are available in both savoury varieties, such as cornmeal and cheese muffins, or sweet varieties such as blueberry, chocolate chip, lemon or banana flavours. They are often eaten as a breakfast food, often accompanied by coffee or tea. Fresh baked muffins are sold by bakeries, donut shops and some fast food restaurants and coffeehouses. Factory baked muffins are sold at grocery stores and convenience stores and are also served in some coffee shops and cafeterias.\n\nRecipes for quick bread muffins are common in 19th-century American cookbooks. Recipes for yeast-based muffins, which were sometimes called \"common muffins\" or \"wheat muffins\" in 19th-century American cookbooks, can be found in much older cookbooks. In her \"Boston Cooking-School Cook Book\", Fannie Farmer gave recipes for both types of muffins, both those that used yeast to raise the dough and those that used a quick bread method, using muffin rings to shape the English muffins. Farmer indicated that stove top \"baking\", as is done with yeast dough, was a useful method when baking in an oven was not practical.\nQuickbread muffins are made with flour, sieved together with bicarbonate of soda as a raising agent. To this is added butter, eggs and any flavourings (fruit, such as blueberries, chocolate or banana; or savouries, such as cheese). The mix is turned into a pocketed muffin tray, or into individual paper moulds, and baked in an oven. The result are raised, individual quickbreads.\n\nFlatbread muffins (known in the United States and elsewhere as \"English muffins\", or simply 'muffins' in Britain) were first mentioned in literature in the early 18th century, although the product is undoubtedly older than that. The word \"muffin\" is thought to derive from the German \"mouffin\".\n\nThis product is a flatter disk-shaped, typically unsweetened bread of English or European origin. These muffins are popular in Commonwealth countries and the United States. Flatbread muffins are often served toasted for breakfast. They may be served with butter or margarine, and topped with sweet toppings, such as jam or honey, or savoury toppings (e.g., round sausage, cooked egg, cheese or bacon). Flatbread muffins are typically eaten as a breakfast food.\n\nThe flatbread muffin is a type of yeast-leavened bread; generally about round and tall. Rather than being oven-baked, they are cooked in a griddle on the stove top and flipped from side-to-side, which results in their typical flattened shape rather than the rounded top seen in baked rolls or cake-type muffins. Flatbread muffins were known to American settlers, but declined in popularity with the advent of the quickbread muffin. They were re-introduced to the American market in 1880 as \"English muffins\" by English-American baker Samuel Beth Thomas (whose baked-goods company Thomas' survives to this day).\n\nThe name is first found in print in 1703, spelled \"moofin\"; it is of uncertain origin but possibly derived from the Low German \"Muffen\", the plural of \"Muffe\" meaning a small cake, or possibly with some connection to the Old French \"moufflet\" meaning soft as said of bread.\n\nThis photo is a sequence showing the preparation of a flatbread muffin based on a recipe by Alton Brown in \"The Muffin Man\" episode of the television cooking show \"Good Eats\".\n\nMuffin tins and muffin pans are typically metal bakeware which has round bowl-shaped depressions into which muffin batter is poured. Muffin tins or pans can be greased with butter or cooking spray, to lessen the issue of batter sticking to the pan. Alternatively, muffin cups or cases are used. Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They are used in the baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.\nA variety of sizes for muffin cases are available. Slightly different sizes are considered \"standard\" in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly in diameter at the base and tall. Standard-size cases range from in diameter at the base and are tall. Some jumbo-size cases can hold more than twice the size of standard cases. Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.\n\nA \"Muffineer\" was originally a sugar shaker, looking like a large salt cellar with a perforated decorative top, for spreading powdered sugar on muffins and other sweet cakes. Later, in the 19th century, the term was also used to describe a silver, or silver-plated, \"muffin dish\", with a domed lid and a compartment below for hot water, used to keep toasted English muffins warm before serving.\n\nProbably the best-known reference to English Muffins is in Oscar Wilde's 1895 play: \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", where Jack says to Algernon:\n\n- \"How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.\" \n\n- \"Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.\" \n\n- \"I say it’s perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.\"\n\n"}

Preparing the traditional dish is also continued by Poles from L'viv whose families were resettled in the Recovered Territories after World War II.\n\nHistorically a peasant food, it was often used as a substitute for bread or even as a staple food in the poor rural areas. However, in the last decades it has emerged as an upscale dish available in the finest restaurants.\n\nHistorically, porridge is the oldest form of consumption of grains in the whole of humanity, long before the appearance of bread. Originally, the seeds used to prepare slurries were very diverse as millet or einkorn.\n\nBefore the introduction of maize in Europe in the 16th century, mămăliga had been made with millet flour, known to the Romans as \"pulmentum\". Moreover, the Romans ate so much of it that the Greeks called them \"pultiphagonides\" (porridge eaters).\n\nMaize was introduced into Spain by Hernán Cortés from Mexico in 1530 and spread in Europe in the 16th century. Maize (called \"corn\" in the United States) requires a good amount of heat and humidity. The Danube Valley is one of Europe's regions ideal for growing maize.\n\nA Hungarian scholar documented the arrival of corn in Timişoara, Banat region, 1692. In Transylvania, maize is also called 'cucuruz', which could imply a connection between Transylvanian and Serbian merchants, kukuruz being a Slavic word. Some assume it was either Şerban Cantacuzino or Constantin Mavrocordat who introduced corn in Wallachia, Maria Theresa in Transylvania and Constantine Ducas in Moldavia where it is called păpuşoi.\nMămăligă of millet would have been replaced gradually by mămăligă made of corn. The corn then become an important food, especially in the fight against famine which prevailed in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nHistorian Nicolae Iorga noted that farmers of the Romanian Principalities had grown corn since the early-to-mid-17th century.\n\nEtienne Ignace Raicevich, a Republic of Ragusa Ragusan consul of the Napoleonic Empire to Bucharest in the third quarter of the 18th century, wrote that corn was introduced only \"da poco tempo\".\n\nIn an edition of Larousse, the French dictionary, in the Danubian principalities, the existence of corn-based mămăligă dates from 1873. mamaliga s. f. Boiled corn meal.\n\nTraditionally, \"mămăliga\" is cooked by boiling water, salt and cornmeal in a special-shaped cast iron pot called \"ceaun\" or \"tuci\". When cooked peasant-style and used as a bread substitute, \"mămăliga\" is supposed to be much thicker than the regular Italian polenta to the point that it can be cut in slices, like bread. When cooked for other purposes, \"mămăligă\" can be much softer, sometimes almost to the consistency of porridge. Because \"mămăligă\" sticks to metal surfaces, a piece of sewing thread is used to cut it into slices instead of a knife; it can then be eaten by holding it with the hand, just like bread.\n\n\"Mămăliga\" is a versatile food: various recipes of \"mămăligă\"-based dishes may include milk, butter, various types of cheese, eggs, sausages (usually fried, grilled or oven-roasted), bacon, mushrooms, ham, fish etc. \"Mămăliga\" is a fat-free, cholesterol-free, high-fiber food. It can be used as a healthy alternative to more refined carbohydrates such as white bread, pasta or hulled rice.\n\n\"Mămăligă\" is often served with sour cream and cheese on the side (\"mămăligă cu brânză și smântână\") or crushed in a bowl of hot milk (\"mămăligă cu lapte\"). Sometimes slices of \"mămăligă\" are pan-fried in oil or in lard, the result being a sort of corn pone.\n\nAlso, the traditional meal is served with meat, usually pork called \"tocana\" or fried fish and \"mujdei\" (a mix of oil and garlic)\n\nSince \"mămăliga\" can be used as an alternative for bread in many Romanian and Moldovan dishes, there are quite a few which are either based on \"mămăligă\", or include it as an ingredient or side dish. Arguably, the most popular of them is sarmale (a type of cabbage roll) with \"mămăligă\".\n\nAnother very popular Romanian dish based on \"mămăligă\" is called bulz, and consists of \"mămăligă\" with cheese and butter and roasted in the oven.\n\nBalmoș (sometimes spelled balmuș) is another \"mămăligă\"-like traditional Romanian dish, but is more elaborate. Unlike \"mămăligă\" (where the cornmeal is boiled in water) when making \"balmoș\" the cornmeal must be boiled in sheep milk. Other ingredients, such as butter, sour cream, \"telemea\" (a type of feta cheese), \"caș\" (a type of fresh curdled ewe cheese without whey, which is sometimes called \"green cheese\" in English), \"urdă\" (a type of curdled cheese obtained by boiling and curdling the whey left from \"caș\"), etc., are added to the mixture at certain times during the cooking process. It is a specialty dish of old Romanian shepherds, and nowadays very few people still know how to make a proper \"balmoș\".\n\n\nIn Chapter One of \"Dracula\" by Bram Stoker is the commentary, \"I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was ‘mamaliga’, and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a very excellent dish, which they call ‘impletata’”.\n\nMămăliga is similar to the Italian \"polenta\", which is also very popular in Brazil.\n\nCornmeal mush is its analogue common in some regions of the United States and grits in the southern regions.\n\nIts analogue in Serbia and Bulgaria is called kačamak (), () and is served mainly with white brine cheese or fried pieces of pork fat with parts of the skin.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia (also \"polenta\" or \"palenta\"), Serbia (also \"kačamak\") and in Montenegro the dish is mainly called \"pura\". In North Macedonia it is called \"bakrdan\" () and in Slovenia \"polenta\". In Hungary it is called \"puliszka\".\n\nIn Turkey a similar dish, called \"kuymak\" or \"muhlama\" is among the typical dishes of the Black Sea Region, although now popular in all the greater cities where there are many regional restaurants.\n\nBroccoliga is a variant of Mămăliga featuring a broccoli-polenta mixture suffused with cheddar cheese and herbs.\n\nKnown by different names in local languages ( \"abysta\", \"mamrys\", \"ghomi\", \"zhuran-khudar\", Chechen: \"ah'ar-hudar/zhuran-hudar\", Nogai: мамырза \"mamyrza\", \"dzykka\" or сера \"sera\"), it is also widespread in Caucasian cuisines.\n\nThere is also a distinct similarity to Cou-cou (as it is known in the Barbados), or Fungi (as it is known in the Antigua and Barbuda, and other Leeward Islands in the Caribbean Sea).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "314318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314318", "title": "Kumari (goddess)", "text": "Kumari (goddess)\n\nKumari, or Kumari Devi, or Living Goddess – Nepal is the tradition of worshiping young prepubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in Hindu religious traditions. The word \"Kumari\" is derived from the Sanskrit \"Kaumarya\", meaning \"princess\".\n\nIn Nepal, a Kumari is a prepubescent girl selected from the Shakya caste or Bajracharya clan of the Nepalese Newari community. The Kumari is revered and worshiped by some of the country's Hindus. \nWhile there are several Kumaris throughout Nepal, with some cities having several, the best known is the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu, and she lives in the Kumari Ghar, a palace in the center of the city. The selection process for her is especially rigorous. As of 2017, the Royal Kumari is Trishna Shakya, aged three, installed in September 2017 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy. Unika Bajracharya, selected in April 2014 as the Kumari of Patan, is the second most important living goddess.\n\nA Kumari is generally chosen for one day and worshiped accordingly on certain festivals like Navaratri or Durga Puja. In Kathmandu Valley, this is a particularly prevalent practice. A Kumari is believed to be the incarnation of Taleju. When her first menstruation begins, it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes loss of deity.\n\nThe worship of the goddess in a young girl represents the worship of divine consciousness spread all over the creation. As the supreme goddess is thought to have manifested this entire cosmos out of her womb, she exists equally in animate as well as inanimate objects. While worship of an idol represents the worship and recognition of supreme through inanimate materials, worship of a human represents veneration and recognition of the same supreme in conscious beings.\n\nIn the Shakta text \"Devi Mahatmyam\" or \"Chandi\", the goddess is said to have declared that she resides in all female living beings in this universe. The entire ritual of Kumari is based on this verse. But while worshiping a goddess, only a young girl is chosen over a mature woman because of their inherent purity and chastity.\n\nHindu scriptures like the \"Jñanarnava Rudrayamala\" tantra assign names to a Kumari depending on her age. A one-year-old girl is called Sandhya, a two-year-old girl is called Sarasvati, a child of three years of age is called Tridhamurti, at her fourth year she is Kalika, at her fifth she is Subhaga, at her sixth she is Parvati/Uma, at her seventh year she is called Malini. An eight-year-old girl is called Kubjika, on the ninth year she is Kaalasandarbha, on reaching the tenth year she is Aparajita, on eleventh she is Rudrani, on twelfth year she is named Bhairavi, on thirteenth she is Mahalakshmi, on fourteenth she is Pithanayika, on fifteenth she is Kshetragya, and on sixteen years of her age she is Ambika.\n\nIn Nepal, Kumaris are worshiped only for a day; these names are assigned only while the ritual lasts, often a few hours. Usually one cannot be a Kumari beyond 16 years of age because of menarche.\n\nThe main target of a Kumari puja is to realize the potential divinity in every human being, mostly female. A Hindu spiritual aspirant sees the universal consciousness of humanity.\n\nWhilst the veneration of a living Kumari in Nepal is relatively recent, dating only from the 17th century, the tradition of Kumari-Puja, or virgin worship, has been around for much longer. There is evidence of virgin worship taking place in Nepal for more than 2,300 years. It appears to have taken hold in Nepal in the 6th century. There is written evidence describing the selection, ornamentation, and worship of the Kumari dating from the 13th century CE.\n\nThere are several legends telling of how the current tradition of the Kumari began. Most of the legends, however, the tale of King Jayaprakash Malla, the last Nepalese king of the Malla Dynasty (12th–17th century CE). According to the most popular legend, a king and his friend, the goddess Taleju, approached his chambers late one night as he played tripasa, a dice game. The goddess came along every night to play the game, with the condition that the king refrains from telling anyone about their meetings.\n\nBut one night the king's wife followed him to his chamber in order to find out who the king was meeting so often. The king's wife saw Taleju and the goddess was angered. She told the king that, if he wanted to see her again or have her protect his country, he'd have to search for her among the Newari (Shakya) community of Ratnawali, as she would be incarnated as a little girl among them. Hoping to make amends with his patroness, King Jayaprakash Malla left the palace in search of the young girl who was possessed by Taleju's spirit.\n\nSimilarly, there is another story about the disappearance of Taleju. Some believe that the goddess visited king Trailokya Malla every night in the human form. Like other legendary stories, the king and the goddess played tripasa (dice) while discussing the welfare of the country. However, one-night king Trailokya Malla made sexual advances towards the goddess Taleju. As a result, the goddess in rage stopped visiting the palace. The king in regret worshiped and pleaded for her return. Finally, the goddess agreed to appear in the body of the virgin girl from the Shakya family.\n\nIn another version of the story, a king was very promiscuous. He was also attracted to young girls. Unfortunately, during sex with a young girl, she died. This left the king disturbed, guilt-ridden and saddened, and he repented by concluding that the girl had returned to her spiritual goddess nature. He declared the creation of the Kumari Devi to perpetually remind the world of the sacred nature of young girls and virginity.\n\nEven today, a mother's dream of a red serpent is believed to be a portent of the elevation of her daughter to the position of Royal Kumari. And each year, the Nepalese King seeks the blessing of the Royal Kumari at the festival of Indra Jatra. This tradition has changed from 2008 A.D with the country becoming the youngest republic of the world. \n\nA variation of this and other legends names King Gunkam Dev, a 12th-century ancestor of King Jayaprakash Malla, as the main character rather than Jayaprakash Malla.\n\nA third variation of the legend says that during the reign of King Jayaprakash Malla, a young girl was banished from the city because it was feared that she was possessed by the goddess Durga. When the queen learned of the young girl's fate, she became enraged and insisted that the king fetch the girl and install her as the living incarnation of Durga.\n\nOnce Taleju has left the sitting Kumari, there is a frenzy of activity to find her successor. Some have compared the selection process to the process used in nearby Tibet to find the reincarnations of Tulkus, such as the Dalai Lama or the Panchen Lama. The selection process is conducted by five senior Buddhist Bhajracharya priests, the Panch Buddha, the Bada Guruju or Chief Royal Priest, Achajau the priest of Taleju and the royal astrologer. The King and other religious leaders that might know of eligible candidates are also informed that a search is underway.\n\nEligible girls are from the Newar Shakya caste of silver and goldsmiths. She must be in excellent health, never have shed blood or been afflicted by any diseases, be without blemish and must not have yet lost any teeth. Girls who pass these basic eligibility requirements are examined for the \"battis lakshanas\", or \"thirty-two perfections\" of a goddess. Some of these are poetically listed as such:\n\n\nIn addition to this, her hair and eyes should be very \"black\", she should have dainty hands and feet, small and well-recessed sexual organs and a set of twenty teeth.\n\nThe girl is also observed for signs of serenity and fearlessness and her horoscope is examined to ensure that it is complementary to the King's. It is important that there not be any conflicts as she must confirm the King's legitimacy each year of her divinity. Her family is also scrutinized to ensure its piety and devotion to the King.\n\nOnce the priests have chosen a candidate, she must undergo yet more rigorous tests to ensure that she indeed possesses the qualities necessary to be the living vessel of Durga. Her greatest test comes during the Hindu festival of Dashain. On the Kalratri, or 'black night', 108 buffaloes and goats are sacrificed to the goddess Kali. The young candidate is taken into the Taleju temple and released into the courtyard, where the severed heads of the animals are illuminated by candlelight and masked men are dancing about. If the candidate truly possesses the qualities of Taleju, she shows no fear during this experience. If she does, another candidate is brought in to attempt the same thing.\n\nAs a final test, the living goddess must spend a night alone in a room among the heads of ritually slaughtered goats and buffaloes without showing fear. The fearless candidate has proven that she has the serenity and the fearlessness that typifies the goddess who is to inhabit her. After passing all other tests, the final test is that she must be able to pick out the personal belongings of the previous Kumari from an assortment of things laid out before her. If she is able to do so, there is no remaining doubt that she is the chosen one.\n\nThere are claims contrary to the commonly believed ritual and screening process, however. The ex-Royal Kumari Rashmila Shakya states in her autobiography \"From Goddess to Mortal\" that this has nothing to do with the selection process, but rather is a ritual the Royal Kumari goes through each year, and that there are no men dancing around in masks trying to scare her, and that at most there are only a dozen or so decapitated animal heads in the scary room test. She also describes the requisite physical examination of each Kumari as neither intimate nor rigorous.\n\nOnce the Kumari is chosen, she must be purified so that she can be an unblemished vessel for Taleju. She is taken by the priests to undergo a number of secret Tantric rituals to cleanse her body and spirit of her past experiences. Once these rituals are completed, Taleju enters her and she is presented as the new Kumari. She is dressed and made up as a Kumari and then leaves the Taleju temple and walks across the square on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar that will be her home for the duration of her divinity.\n\nOnce the chosen girl completes the Tantric purification rites and crosses from the temple on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar to assume her throne, her life takes on an entirely new character. She will leave her palace only on ceremonial occasions. Her family will visit her rarely, and then only in a formal capacity. Her playmates will be drawn from a narrow pool of Newari children from her caste, usually the children of her caretakers. She will always be dressed in red, wear her hair in a topknot and have the \"agni chakshu\" or \"fire eye\" painted on her forehead as a symbol of her special powers of perception.\n\nThe Royal Kumari's new life is vastly different from the one to which she has been accustomed in her short life. Whilst her life is now free of material troubles, she has ceremonial duties to carry out. Although she is not ordered about, she is expected to behave as befits a goddess. She has shown the correct qualities during the selection process and her continued serenity is of paramount importance; an ill-tempered goddess is believed to portend bad tidings for those petitioning her.\n\nThe Kumari's walk across the Durbar Square is the last time her feet will touch the ground until such time as the goddess departs from her body. From now on, when she ventures outside of her palace, she will be carried or transported in her golden palanquin. Her feet, like all of her, are now sacred. Petitioners will touch them, hoping to receive respite from troubles and illnesses. The King himself will kiss them each year when he comes to seek her blessing. She will never wear shoes; if her feet are covered at all, they will be covered with red stockings.\n\nThe power of the Kumari is perceived to be so strong that even a glimpse of her is believed to bring good fortune. Crowds of people wait below the Kumari's window in the Kumari Chowk, or courtyard, of her palace, hoping that she will pass by the latticed windows on the third floor and glance down at them. Even though her irregular appearances last only a few seconds, the atmosphere in the courtyard is charged with devotion and awe when they do occur.\n\nThe more fortunate, or better connected, petitioners visit the Kumari in her chambers where she sits upon a gilded lion throne. Many of those visiting her are people suffering from blood or menstrual disorders since the Kumari is believed to have special power over such illnesses. She is also visited by bureaucrats and other government officials. Petitioners customarily bring gifts and food offerings to the Kumari, who receives them in silence. Upon arrival, she offers them her feet to touch or kiss as an act of devotion. During these audiences, the Kumari is closely watched and her actions interpreted as a prediction of the petitioners' lives', for example as follows:\n\n\nIf the Kumari remains silent and impassive throughout the audience, her devotees leave elated. This is the sign that their wishes have been granted.\n\nMany people attend to the Kumari's needs. These people are known as the Kumarimi and are headed by the patron. Their job is very difficult. They must attend to the Kumari's every need and desire while giving her instruction in her ceremonial duties. While they cannot directly order her to do anything, they must guide her through her life. They are responsible for bathing her, dressing her and attending to her makeup as well as preparing her for her visitors and for ceremonial occasions.\n\nTraditionally, the Kumari received no education as she was widely considered to be omniscient. However, modernization has made it necessary for her to have an education once she re-enters mortal life. Kumaris are now allowed to attend public schools and have a life inside the classroom that is no different from that of other students. While many kumaris, such as the Kumari of Bhaktapur, attend school, others, such as the main kumari in Kathmandu, receive their education through private tutors.\n\nSimilarly, her limited playmates must learn to respect her. Since her every wish must be granted, they must learn to surrender to her whatever they have that she may want and to defer to her wishes in what games to play or activities to play.\n\nOn 3 July 2007, Sajani Shakya was removed from her position as Kumari of Bhaktapur after visiting the United States to attend the release of the movie \"Living Goddess\" at Silverdocs, the American Film Institute/Discovery Channel documentary festival in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland. The visit, according to the elders, had tainted her purity. A couple of weeks later, temple authorities at Sajani Shakya's hometown recanted their previous statement and said that she would not be stripped of her title because she was willing to undergo a \"cleansing\" ceremony to remove any sins she might have committed while traveling.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "314994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314994", "title": "Biscuit", "text": "Biscuit\n\nBiscuit is a term used for a variety of primarily flour-based baked food products. The term is applied to two distinct products. This article covers the type of biscuit found in Africa, Asia and Europe, which is typically hard, flat and unleavened. In North America, a biscuit is typically a soft, leavened quick bread, and is covered in the article Biscuit (bread).\n\nThe modern-day difference in the English language regarding the word \"biscuit\" is provided by British cookery writer Elizabeth David in \"English Bread and Yeast Cookery\", in the chapter \"Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes\" and section \"Soft Biscuits\". She writes, It is interesting that these soft biscuits (such as scones) are common to Scotland and Guernsey, and that the term biscuit as applied to a soft product was retained in these places, and in America, whereas in England it has completely died out.\nThe Old French word \"bescuit\" is derived from the Latin words \"bis\" (twice) and \"coquere\", \"coctus\" (to cook, cooked), and, hence, means \"twice-cooked\". This is because biscuits were originally cooked in a twofold process: first baked, and then dried out in a slow oven. This term was then adapted into English in the 14th century during the Middle Ages, in the Middle English word \"bisquite\", to represent a hard, twice-baked product. (see the German Zwieback) The Dutch language from around 1703 had adopted the word \"koekje\" (\"little cake\") to have a similar meaning for a similar hard, baked product. The difference between the secondary Dutch word and that of Latin origin is that, whereas the \"koekje\" is a cake that rises during baking, the biscuit, which has no raising agent, in general does not (see gingerbread/ginger biscuit), except for the expansion of heated air during baking.\n\nWhen continental Europeans began to emigrate to colonial North America, the two words and their \"same but different\" meanings began to clash. The words \"cookie\" or \"cracker\" became the words of choice to mean a hard, baked product. Further confusion has been added by the adoption of the word biscuit for a small leavened bread popular in the United States. According to the American English dictionary Merriam-Webster, a cookie is a \"small flat or slightly raised cake\". A biscuit is \"any of various hard or crisp dry baked product\" similar to the American English terms cracker or cookie, or \"a small quick bread made from dough that has been rolled out and cut or dropped from a spoon\".\n\nIn a number of other European languages, terms derived from the latin \"bis coctus\" refer instead to yet another baked product, similar to the sponge cake; e.g. Spanish \"bizcocho\", German \"Biskuitmasse\", Russian \"бисквит\" (\"biskvit\"), Polish \"biszkopt\".\n\nIn modern Italian usage, the term \"biscotto\" is used to refer to any type of hard twice-baked biscuit, and not only to the \"cantuccini\" as in English-speaking countries.\n\nThe need for nutritious, easy-to-store, easy-to-carry, and long-lasting foods on long journeys, in particular at sea, was initially solved by taking live food along with a butcher/cook. However, this took up additional space on what were either horse-powered treks or small ships, reducing the time of travel before additional food was required. This resulted in early armies' adopting the style of hunter-foraging.\n\nThe introduction of the baking of processed cereals including the creation of flour provided a more reliable source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat, brittle loaf of millet bread called \"dhourra\" cake while the Romans had a biscuit called \"buccellum\". Roman cookbook \"Apicius\" describes: \"a thick paste of fine wheat flour was boiled and spread out on a plate. When it had dried and hardened, it was cut up and then fried until crisp, then served with honey and pepper.\"\n\nMany early physicians believed that most medicinal problems were associated with digestion. Hence, for both sustenance and avoidance of illness, a daily consumption of a biscuit was considered good for health.\n\nHard biscuits soften as they age. To solve this problem, early bakers attempted to create the hardest biscuit possible. Because it is so hard and dry, if properly stored and transported, navies' hardtack will survive rough handling and high temperature. Baked hard, it can be kept without spoiling for years as long as it is kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two. To soften hardtack for eating, it was often dunked in brine, coffee, or some other liquid or cooked into a skillet meal.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of biscuit plus one gallon of beer. Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularised naval victualling with varied and nutritious rations. Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which they were baked. When machinery was introduced into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about long and wide which were stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal shaped biscuits. This left the sheets sufficiently coherent to be placed in the oven in one piece and when baked they were easy to separate. The hexagonal shape rather than traditional circular biscuits meant a saving in material and were easier to pack. Biscuits remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor's diet until the introduction of canned foods. Canned meat was first marketed in 1814; preserved beef in tins was officially added to Royal Navy rations in 1847.\n\nEarly biscuits were hard, dry, and unsweetened. They were most often cooked after bread, in a cooling bakers' oven; they were a cheap form of sustenance for the poor.\n\nBy the seventh century AD, cooks of the Persian empire had learnt from their forebears the techniques of lightening and enriching bread-based mixtures with eggs, butter, and cream, and sweetening them with fruit and honey. One of the earliest spiced biscuits was gingerbread, in French, \"pain d'épices\", meaning \"spice bread\", brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk Grégoire de Nicopolis. He left Nicopolis Pompeii, of Lesser Armenia to live in Bondaroy, France, near the town of Pithiviers. He stayed there for seven years and taught French priests and Christians how to cook gingerbread. This was originally a dense, treaclely (molasses-based) spice cake or bread. As it was so expensive to make, early ginger biscuits were a cheap form of using up the leftover bread mix.\n\nWith the combination of the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, and then the Crusades developing the spice trade, the cooking techniques and ingredients of Arabia spread into Northern Europe. By mediaeval times, biscuits were made from a sweetened, spiced paste of breadcrumbs and then baked (e.g., gingerbread), or from cooked bread enriched with sugar and spices and then baked again. King Richard I of England (aka Richard the Lionheart) left for the Third Crusade (1189–92) with \"biskit of muslin\", which was a mixed corn compound of barley, rye, and bean flour.\n\nAs the making and quality of bread had been controlled to this point, so were the skills of biscuit-making through the craft guilds. As the supply of sugar began, and the refinement and supply of flour increased, so did the ability to sample more leisurely foodstuffs, including sweet biscuits. Early references from the Vadstena monastery show how the Swedish nuns were baking gingerbread to ease digestion in 1444. The first documented trade of gingerbread biscuits dates to the 16th century, where they were sold in monastery pharmacies and town square farmers markets. Gingerbread became widely available in the 18th century. The British biscuit firms of McVitie's, Carr's, Huntley & Palmer, and Crawfords were all established by 1850.\n\nAlong with local farm produce of meat and cheese, many regions of the world have their own distinct style of biscuit due to the historic prominence of this form of food.\n\nMost modern biscuits can trace their origins back to either the hardtack ship's biscuit or the creative art of the baker:\n\nBiscuits today can be savoury or sweet, but most are small at around in diameter, and flat. The term biscuit also applies to sandwich-type biscuits, wherein a layer of \"creme\" or icing is sandwiched between two biscuits, such as the custard cream, or a layer of jam (as in biscuits which, in the United Kingdom, are known as \"Jammie Dodgers\")\n\nSweet biscuits are commonly eaten as a snack food, and are, in general, made with wheat flour or oats, and sweetened with sugar or honey. Varieties may contain chocolate, fruit, jam, nuts, ginger, or even be used to sandwich other fillings.\n\nThe digestive biscuit and rich tea have a strong identity in British culture as the traditional accompaniment to a cup of tea and are regularly eaten as such. Some tea drinkers \"dunk\" biscuits in tea, allowing them to absorb liquid and soften slightly before consumption. Chocolate digestives, Rich tea, and Hobnobs were ranked the UK's top three favourite dunking biscuits in 2009, with custard creams coming third in a non-dunking poll.\n\nSavoury biscuits or crackers (such as cream crackers, water biscuits, oatcakes, or crisp breads) are usually plainer and commonly eaten with cheese following a meal. Many savoury biscuits also contain additional ingredients for flavour or texture, such as poppy seeds, onion or onion seeds, cheese (such as cheese melts), and olives. Savoury biscuits also usually have a dedicated section in most European supermarkets, often in the same aisle as sweet biscuits. The exception to savoury biscuits is the sweetmeal digestive known as the \"Hovis biscuit\", which, although slightly sweet, is still classified as a cheese biscuit. Savoury biscuits sold in supermarkets are sometimes associated with a certain geographical area, such as Scottish oatcakes or Cornish wafer biscuits.\n\nIn general, the British, Australians, South Africans, New Zealanders, Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Singaporeans, Nigerians, Kenyans, and the Irish use the British meaning of \"biscuit\" for the sweet biscuit, the terms biscuit and cookie are used interchangeably, depending on the region and the speaker, with biscuits usually referring to hard, sweet biscuits (such as digestives, Nice, Bourbon creams, etc.) and cookies for soft baked goods (i.e. chocolate chip cookies), In Canada, this term is now used less frequently, usually with imported brands of biscuits or in the Maritimes; however, the Canadian Christie Biscuits referred to what Americans would call crackers. This sense is at the root of the name of the United States' most prominent maker of cookies and crackers, the National Biscuit Company, now called Nabisco.\n\nIn the United States and parts of Canada a biscuit is a small bread with a firm browned crust and a soft interior. These biscuits are particularly popular in the American South, where generations have passed down family recipes. They are made with baking powder or baking soda as a chemical leavening agent rather than yeast (a quick bread) although they can also be made using yeast (and are then called angel biscuits) or a sourdough starter.\n\nThey are traditionally served as a side dish with a meal. As a breakfast item they are often eaten with butter and a sweet condiment such as molasses, light sugarcane syrup, maple syrup, sorghum syrup, honey, or fruit jam or jelly. With other meals, they are usually eaten with butter or gravy instead of sweet condiments. However, biscuits and gravy (biscuits covered in country gravy) or biscuits with sausage are usually served for breakfast, sometimes as the main course. A biscuit may also be used to make a breakfast sandwich by slicing it in half and placing eggs and/or breakfast meat in the middle.\n\n"}

This is, however, incorrect.\n\nIn the theoretical SMOT design, a steel ball is pulled up a ramp by an array of permanent magnets. At the top of the ramp it falls, converting magnetic attraction into kinetic energy. A SMOT-like structure is shown in Emil T. Hartman's patent. Watson claims that a mechanism called \"regauging\" happens that allows the cycle to be repeated without the application of outside energy.\n\nPerpetual motion (\"over-unity\") has not been achieved with a SMOT. The ball can be cycled from the starting point of one SMOT to the starting point of a second SMOT (and third and fourth), and by arranging multiple SMOT's in a circle the ball can be circulated along the SMOT's thus giving the illusion of overunity, but the ball can never return to its starting place without adding energy to compensate for frictional losses or for any other energy dissipated by the system.\n\nThe SMOT consists of a non-magnetic inclined plane, a series of permanent magnets, a steel ball and a non-magnetic track (e.g. aluminium). Some versions have a pair of long bar magnets in place of the series of permanent magnets. The inclined plane has a very low grade, but still enough to provide a gain in height.\n\nThe track is positioned so that it is directly in the centre of the inclined plane. Usually, the surface of the track is almost flush with the inclined plane's surface. The two permanent magnets are long bar magnets, polarized with their poles being at the long side, that are placed almost parallel to the track, but the poles nearest to the top of the inclined plane are closer to the track than they are at the bottom. The ball moves up the track because the magnetic field is stronger when the magnets are closer to the steel ball and each other, and since the net force is towards the top of the ramp, the motion of the ball is also that direction. This is why it is imperative that the magnets are constantly getting closer to the ball, in order to create a net force upwards. The track serves to keep the ball away from the magnets. If the track is not constructed carefully a slight imbalance can send the steel ball off of the track into one of the magnets.\n\nAt the starting point, the ball has the potential energy given it by being put there under the forces of the magnets. When the ball is released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as the ball rolls up the track and drops off the top. The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is always constant (minus energy lost due to friction) The ball never has more energy than it did when first put into position. \n\nThe magnetostatic field produced by any arrangement of stationary permanent magnets is a conservative field. This means any magnetic object which moves in a closed-loop path in the field, like the ball in this device, gains no energy from the field, and in the absence of friction ends with the same total energy (kinetic plus potential) it started with. Since any moving object is also subject to friction forces, which dissipate the kinetic energy as it moves, the ball will always end a cycle with less energy than it started with, and will eventually stop moving.\n"}

It is a variation of an earlier, gin-based cocktail called simply an Alexander. The cocktail known as Alexander today may contain gin or brandy.\n\nThere are many rumors about its origins. Some sources say it was created at the time of the London wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles in 1922. Drama critic and Algonquin Round Table member Alexander Woollcott claimed that it was named after him. Other sources say it was named after the Russian tsar Alexander II.\n\nThe drink was possibly named after Troy Alexander, a bartender at Rector's, a New York City restaurant, who created the drink in order to serve a white drink at a dinner celebrating Phoebe Snow, a character in a popular advertising campaign in the early 20th century.\n\nThe cocktail is known to have been John Lennon's favorite drink. He was introduced to the drink on March 12, 1974 by Harry Nilsson, in the midst of Lennon's so-called The pair began heckling the Smothers Brothers, and whilst being ejected Lennon allegedly assaulted a waitress. Lennon later said the drinks \"tasted like milkshakes.\"\n\nIn the movie \"Days of Wine and Roses\", alcoholic Joe Clay (Jack Lemmon) takes Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick) out on a date. When she explains that she dislikes liquor but likes chocolate, he orders her a Brandy Alexander. This begins Kirsten's descent into alcoholism.\n\nIn the 1981 film \"Tattoo\", Bruce Dern takes Maude Adams out for dinner and orders a Brandy Alexander. When she comments that he does not look the Brandy Alexander type, he replies, \"I like the foam...it reminds me of the ocean.\"\n\nThe 1981 Granada Television production of Brideshead Revisited, episode 1, (based on the novel by Evelyn Waugh) has a scene where Anthony Blanche offers Charles Ryder (Jeremy Irons) two Brandy Alexanders while at Oxford.\n\nIn the James Gray movie \"Two Lovers\", Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow) tells Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) she drinks Brandy Alexanders with her boyfriend Ronald, a rich lawyer. Leonard orders one at a restaurant to impress her, but ruins the effect by mistaking the stirrer for a straw.\n\nIn the TV series \"Greenleaf\" the bishop's wife Lady Mae drinks it on a daily basis.\n\nThe character Brandy Alexander in the novel \"Invisible Monsters\" by Chuck Palahniuk is named after the drink.\n\nAnthony Blanche orders four brandies Alexander in Evelyn Waugh's novel \"Brideshead Revisited\". The Granada Television adaptation for television helped repopularize the drink in the 1980s. Christian Kracht repeats the four Brandy Alexanders motif in his 1995 novel \"Faserland\".\nIn Kurt Vonnegut's book, \"Mother Night\", the protagonist suspects that an overly flattering article in the \"Herald Tribune\" about his neighbor was \"written by a pansy full of Brandy Alexanders.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "318329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318329", "title": "Square academic cap", "text": "Square academic cap\n\nThe square academic cap, graduate cap, cap, mortarboard (because of its similarity in appearance to the mortarboard used by brickmasons to hold mortar) or Oxford cap, is an item of academic dress consisting of a horizontal square board fixed upon a skull-cap, with a tassel attached to the centre. In the UK and the US, it is commonly referred to informally in conjunction with an academic gown, as a \"cap and gown\". It is also sometimes termed a square, trencher, or corner-cap. The adjective academical is also used.\n\nThe cap, together with the gown and sometimes a hood, now form the customary uniform of a university graduate in many parts of the world, following a British model.\n\nThe mortarboard is generally believed by scholars to have developed from the biretta, a similar-looking hat worn by Roman Catholic (and High Church Anglican) clergy. The biretta itself may have been a development of the Roman \"pileus quadratus\", a type of skullcap with superposed square and tump (meaning small mound). A reinvention of this type of cap is known as the Bishop Andrewes cap. The Italian \"biretta\" is a word derived from the Medieval Latin \"birretum\" from the Late Latin \"birrus\" \"large hooded cloak\", which is perhaps of Gaulish origin, or from Ancient Greek πυρρός \"pyrrhos\" \"flame-colored, yellow\".\n\nThe cone-shaped red (seldom in black) biretta, related to the ancient Etruscan \"tutulus\" and the Roman \"pileus\", was used in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to identify humanists, students, artists, and learned and blooming youth in general. The shape and the colour conveyed meaning: Red was considered for a long time the royal power, whether because it was difficult to afford vestments of such solid and brilliant dye or because the high symbolic meaning of blood and life, thus the power over life and death.\n\nIt is not casual that the \"capo\" (captain) headwear is found with such frequency in Renaissance paintings as the highly famous one by Piero della Francesca of Federico da Montefeltro with his red cap. Campano wrote about these hats in his \"Life of Niccolò Fortebraccio\", \"he used to wear a red and high hat, the higher from the head the wider it became.\" Federico and Niccolò were Condottieri. The same cap is seen on Bartolomeo Colleoni, commander of the Venetian Armies in 1454, on the Duke Ludovico III Gonzaga and on John Hawkwood in his equestrian monument by Paolo Uccello. This cap as worn by the leading Italian nobles at the end of the fifteenth century became a symbol of their military and civil powers over Italian cities at a time when the whole of Europe was going to be deeply transformed by Italian influences.\n\nIt was originally reserved for holders of master's degrees (the highest qualification in mediæval academia) but was later adopted by bachelors and undergraduates. In the 16th and 17th centuries \"corner-cap\" (\"catercap\" in the Marprelate tracts) was the term used (\"OED\").\n\nOrigins of the most commonly found mortarboard in the United States can be traced to a patent that was filed by an inventor Edward O'Reilly and Catholic priest Joseph Durham who filed their patent in 1950. Their invention and subsequent patent was the result of his idea to incorporate a fiberglass stiffener into the mortarboard thus making it more sturdy. Such mortarboards are very commonplace throughout the world today.\n\nDoctorate holders of some universities wear the mortarboard, although the round Tudor bonnet is more common in Britain. The 4, 6, or 8 cornered \"tam\" is gaining popularity in the US, and in general a soft square tam has some acceptance for women as a substitute for the hard 'square'.\n\nIn the US, the mortarboard is also worn by high school pupils during the presentation of their diplomas.\n\nIn US graduation ceremonies, the side on which the tassel hangs can be important. Sometimes it is consistent among all students throughout the ceremony, in other cases it differs based on level of study with undergraduate students wearing the tassel on the right, and graduate student wearing them on the left. In some ceremonies, the student wears the tassel on one side until reception of the diploma; then it is switched to the other.\n\nAt the secondary school level, the tassel is usually either the school's primary colour or a mix of the school's colours with as many as three colors in a tassel. Sometimes a tassel of a distinctive colour, such as gold, is worn by those graduating with Latin Honours (i.e. \"cum laude\") or on the \"honour roll\".\n\nUniversities in the United States might use tassels in black or the school's colors, usually for higher degrees.\n\nFor bachelor's degrees the tassel may be colored differently from the traditional black or school colors to represent the field (or one as closely related as possible) in which the wearer obtained his or her education. In 1896 most colleges and universities in the United States adopted a uniform code governing academic dress. The tassel may be adorned with a charm in the shape of the digits of the year.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, the American Council on Education (ACE) code states that \"The tassel should be black or the colour appropriate to the subject,\" and only makes an exception for the gold tassel. The gold metallic tassel is reserved for those entitled to wear the doctoral gown, as is the use of velvet for headwear. Only one tassel is worn at a time.\n\nFor schools where the graduation regalia is rented or borrowed by the student, the tassel might be a part of the rental or provided separately. Some schools that do not provide a tassel for graduates to keep may offer a souvenir tassel that is not worn with the regalia.\n\nIn the UK, the tassel is shorter and is gathered at the button at the centre of the board. The U.S. style is slightly longer, gathered at a cord attached to the button.\n\nAt the University of Cambridge, undergraduates by ancient convention used to cut their tassels very short so that the tassel does not extend beyond the edge of the board. After they graduated, they wore the square cap with the tassel at the normal length. This convention has now fallen into disuse; few people now wear headgear with academic dress at any time and undergraduates in particular have no need to wear the cap.\n\nAs with other forms of headdress, academic caps are not generally worn indoors by men (other than by the Chancellor or other high officials), but are usually carried.\nAt the University of Oxford, caps are mandatory dress for matriculation events and for all examinations. It is a commonly repeated myth at Oxford that the cap must be held and may not be worn at all except at the student's graduation; however, there is no rule in the University to this effect, and undergraduates wearing formal academic dress may either carry the cap or wear it. In particular, women undergraduates who exercise the right to wear a soft \"Canterbury\" cap must wear it on their head, rather than carrying it.\n\nIn some graduation ceremonies caps have been dispensed with for men, being issued only to women, who do wear them indoors, or have been abandoned altogether. This has led to urban legends in a number of universities in the United Kingdom and Ireland which have as a common theme that idea that the wearing of the cap was abandoned in protest at the admission of women to the university. This story is told at the Universities of Cambridge, Dublin, Durham and Newcastle, Bristol, St Andrews, and the Queen's University, Belfast among others.\n\nThere are several types of mortarboard that are usually made. The most common in the UK is the 'folding skull' in which the skull part can be folded for ease of storing and carrying. Traditionally, the mortarboard had a 'rigid skull' which is considered more aesthetically pleasing and better fitting than a folding-skull one. In addition, the rigid skull type has the advantage of being easier to doff than the folding skull version, as there is no possibility of the skull collapsing in on itself. Many degree ceremonies in British universities include the ritual doffing of caps. Both types require the wearer to wear the appropriate size to fit. In the US, an 'elasticated skull' is mostly used which eliminates the need to make many mortarboards in different hat sizes. Some mortarboards, especially those in east Asia are laced-up at the back of the skull cap.\n\nThe correct way to wear a mortarboard is to have the larger part of the skull of the mortarboard at the back of the head with the top board parallel to the ground. A proper fitting mortarboard should not fall off easily.\n\nUntil the second half of the twentieth century, mortarboards were often worn by schoolteachers, and the hat remains an icon of the teaching profession.\n\nMortarboards are often seen in party supply shops in the United States in May and June, when they appear in the form of party decorations, on commemorative gifts such as teddy bears, and on congratulatory greeting cards.\n\nThere is a version of the mortarboard that is worn during mourning. Instead of a tassel and button on top of the board there are two black ribbons that are attached from corner to corner of the board forming a cross. At the centre where the two ribbons intersect a black ribbon rosette is attached. The ribbon for the wide ribbons is grosgrain ribbon whilst the rosette can be made of either the same grosgrain or satin. This mourning cap can be worn when mourning a personal friend or a family relative.\n\nAnother version has nine ribbon bows called \"butterflies\" attached to the back of the skull cap (three running vertically down the back seam, two vertically eitherside further towards the sides and one eitherside at the sides of the skull) in addition to the above. This cap is worn during the mourning of the monarch, a member of the royal family or the university chancellor.\n\nThe mourning cap is worn with mourning bands (normal bands but with a pleat running down each band) and a mourning gown which is either a Cambridge DD undress gown with \"pudding-sleeves\" but in black stuff rather than silk as worn in the sixteenth-seventeenth centuries or a plain black stuff gown. Hoods are not worn, as they are considered festal items. However, Cambridge proctors in the past wore their MA hoods squared, so as to conceal the lining; since the lining was white it did not clash with the black and white color scheme of mourning.\n\n\n"}
