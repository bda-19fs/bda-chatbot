{"id": "37513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37513", "title": "Adverb", "text": "Adverb\n\nAn adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, determiner, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as \"how?\", \"in what way?\", \"when?\", \"where?\", and \"to what extent?\". This function is called the adverbial function, and may be realized by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word expressions (adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses).\n\nAdverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the parts of speech. However, modern linguists note that the term \"adverb\" has come to be used as a kind of \"catch-all\" category, used to classify words with various different types of syntactic behavior, not necessarily having much in common except that they do not fit into any of the other available categories (noun, adjective, preposition, etc.)\n\nThe English word \"adverb\" derives (through French) from Latin \"adverbium\", from \"ad-\" (\"to\"), \"verbum\" (\"word\", \"verb\"), and the nominal suffix \"-ium\". The term implies that the principal function of adverbs is to act as modifiers of verbs or verb phrases. An adverb used in this way may provide information about the manner, place, time, frequency, certainty, or other circumstances of the activity denoted by the verb or verb phrase. Some examples:\n\nAdverbs can also be used as modifiers of adjectives, and of other adverbs, often to indicate degree. Examples:\n\nThey can also modify determiners, prepositional phrases, or whole clauses or sentences, as in the following examples:\nAdverbs thus perform a wide range of modifying functions. The major exception is the function of modifier of nouns, which is performed instead by adjectives (compare \"she sang loudly\" with \"her loud singing disturbed me\"; here the verb \"sang\" is modified by the adverb \"loudly\", whereas the noun \"singing\" is modified by the adjective \"loud\"). However, because some adverbs and adjectives are homonyms, their respective functions are sometimes conflated:\nThe word “Even”' in the first sentence is an adjective, since it is a prepositive modifier that modifies the noun, “numbers” (compare “these even numbers ...”). By contrast, the word “Even”' in the second sentence is a prepositive adverb that modifies the clause, “'camels need to drink.” The word “Even” in the third sentence also is a prepositive adverb that modifies the clause containing the “a camel” a noun phrase.\nAlthough it possible for an adverb to precede or to follow a noun or a noun phrase, the adverb nonetheless does \"not\" modify either in such cases, as in:\nIn the first sentence, “Internationally” is a prepositive adverb that modifies the clause, “'there is…” In the second sentence, “internationally” is a postpositive adverb that modifies the clause, “There is…” By contrast, the third sentence contains “international” as a prepositive adjective that modifies the noun, “shortage.” \nAdverbs can sometimes be used as predicative expressions; in English this applies especially to adverbs of location:\n\nWhen the function of an adverb is performed by an expression consisting of more than one word, it is called an adverbial phrase or adverbial clause, or simply an adverbial.\n\nIn English, adverbs of manner (answering the question \"how?\") are often formed by adding \"-ly\" to adjectives. Other languages often have similar methods for deriving adverbs from adjectives (French, for example, uses the suffix \"-ment\"), or else use the same form for both adjectives and adverbs, as in German and Dutch where for example \"schnell\" or \"snel\", respectively, can mean either \"quick\" or \"quickly\", depending on the context. Many other adverbs, however, are not related to adjectives in this way; they may be derived from other words or phrases, or may be single morphemes. Examples of such adverbs in English include \"here, there, together, yesterday, aboard, very, almost\", etc.\n\nWhere the meaning permits, adverbs may undergo comparison, taking comparative and superlative forms. In English this is usually done by adding \"more\" and \"most\" before the adverb (\"more slowly, most slowly\"), although there are a few adverbs that take inflected forms, such as \"well\", for which \"better\" and \"best\" are used.\n\nFor more information about the formation and use of adverbs in English, see . For other languages, see below, and the articles on individual languages and their grammars.\n\nAdverbs are considered a part of speech in traditional English grammar, and are still included as a part of speech in grammar taught in schools and used in dictionaries. However, modern grammarians recognize that words traditionally grouped together as adverbs serve a number of different functions. Some describe adverbs a \"catch-all\" category that includes all words that do not belong to one of the other parts of speech.\n\nA logical approach to dividing words into classes relies on recognizing which words can be used in a certain context. For example, the only type of word that can be inserted in the following template to form a grammatical sentence is a noun:\nWhen this approach is taken, it is seen that adverbs fall into a number of different categories. For example, some adverbs can be used to modify an entire sentence, whereas others cannot. Even when a sentential adverb has other functions, the meaning is often not the same. For example, in the sentences \"She gave birth naturally\" and \"Naturally, she gave birth\", the word \"naturally\" has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means \"in a natural manner\", while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like \"of course\".\n\nWords like \"very\" afford another example. We can say \"Perry is very fast\", but not \"Perry very won the race\". These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like \"here\" and \"there\" that cannot modify adjectives. We can say \"The sock looks good there\" but not \"It is a there beautiful sock\". The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like \"naturally\" that have different meanings in their different functions. Rodney Huddleston distinguishes between a \"word\" and a \"lexicogrammatical-word\".\n\nGrammarians find difficulty categorizing negating words, such as the English \"not\". Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Germany, the liquor korn is sometimes used instead, while in Flanders and the Netherlands, \"jonge jenever\" is preferred.\n\nIt is called a U-Boot (German abbreviation of \"Unterseeboot\", \"submarine\") because the shot glass of vodka sinks to the bottom of the glass of beer.

{"id": "37733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37733", "title": "Blancmange", "text": "Blancmange\n\nBlancmange (, from ) is a sweet dessert commonly made with milk or cream and sugar thickened with gelatin, corn starch or Irish moss (a source of carrageenan), and often flavoured with almonds.\n\nIt is usually set in a mould and served cold. Although traditionally white, blancmanges are frequently given alternative colours. Some similar desserts are French chef 's Bavarian cream, Italy's , China's \"annin tofu\", Turkey's , Hawaiʻi's and Puerto Rico's .\n\nThe historical blancmange originated some time in the Middle Ages and usually consisted of capon or chicken, milk or almond milk, rice and sugar and was considered to be an ideal food for the sick. is a sweet contemporary Turkish pudding made with shredded chicken, similar to the medieval European dish.\n\nThe true origin of the blancmange is obscure, but it is believed by some that it was a result of the Arab introduction of rice and almonds in early medieval Europe. However, there is no evidence of the existence of any similar Arab dishes from that period; though the Arabic is similar, its origins are uncertain. Variants of the dish appear in numerous European cultures with closely related names including in Italy and in Spain. Additionally, related or similar dishes have existed in other areas of Europe under different names, such as the 13th-century Danish (\"white mush\"), and the Anglo-Norman (\"white Syrian dish\"); Dutch (from Latin , \"to strain\") was known in English as and in French as , and was based on cooked and then strained poultry. The oldest recipe found so far for blancmange is from a copy of the oldest extant Danish cookbook, written by , who died in 1244, which dates it to the early 13th century at the latest. The Danish work may be a translation of a German cookbook, which is believed to have been based on a Latin or Romance vernacular manuscript from the 12th century or even earlier.\n\nThe \"whitedish\" (from the original Old French term ) was an upper-class dish common to most of Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern period. It occurs in countless variations from recipe collections from all over Europe and was one of the few truly international dishes of medieval and early modern Europe. It is mentioned in the prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and in an early 15th-century cookbook written by the chefs of Richard II. The basic ingredients were milk or almond milk, sugar, and shredded chicken (usually capon) or fish, often combined with rosewater and rice flour and mixed into a bland stew. Almond milk and fish were used as substitutes for the other animal products on fast days and Lent. It was also often flavoured with spices like saffron or cinnamon and the chicken could be exchanged for various types of fowl, like quail or partridge. Spices were often used in recipes of the later Middle Ages since they were considered highly prestigious.\n\nOn festive occasions and among the upper classes, whitedishes were often rendered more festive by various colouring agents: the reddish-golden yellow of saffron; green with various herbs; or sandalwood for russet. In 14th-century France, parti-colouring, the use of two bright contrasting colours on the same plate, was especially popular and was described by (also known as ), one of the primary authors of the later editions of . The brightly coloured whitedishes were one of the most common of the early entremets, edibles that were intended to entertain and delight through a gaudy appearance, as much as through flavour.\n\nIn the 17th century (1666), the durian was compared to the blanc-mangé by Alexandre de Rhodes: \n\nIn the 17th century, the whitedish evolved into a meatless dessert pudding with cream and eggs and, later, gelatin. In the 19th century, arrowroot and cornflour were added, and the dish evolved into the modern blancmange.\n\nThe word blancmange derives from Old French . The name \"whitedish\" is a modern term used by some historians, though the name historically was either a direct translation from or a calque of the Old French term. Many different local or regional terms were used for the dish in the Middle Ages:\n\n\nThough it is fairly certain that the etymology is indeed \"white dish\", medieval sources are not always consistent as to the actual colour of the dish. Food scholar Terence Scully has proposed the alternative etymology of , \"bland dish\", reflecting its often mild and \"dainty\" (in this context meaning refined and aristocratic) taste and popularity as a sick dish.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37958", "title": "Newcastle Brown Ale", "text": "Newcastle Brown Ale\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale is a brown ale, originally produced in Newcastle upon Tyne, but now brewed by Heineken at the Zoeterwoude Brewery in the Netherlands.\n\nLaunched in 1927 by Colonel Jim Porter after three years of development, the 1960 merger of Newcastle Breweries with Scottish Brewers afforded the beer national distribution and sales peaked in the United Kingdom during the early 1970s. The brand underwent a resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s with student unions selling the brand. By the late 1990s, the beer was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in the UK. By the 2000s, the majority of sales were in the United States, although it still sells 100 million bottles annually in the UK. Brewing moved in 2005 from Newcastle to Dunston, Tyne and Wear, in 2010 to Tadcaster, and in 2017 to the Heineken Brewery in Zoeterwoude, the Netherlands.\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale is perceived in the UK as a working-man's beer, with a long association with heavy industry, the traditional economic staple of the North East of England. In export markets, it is seen as a trendy, premium import and is predominantly drunk by the young. It was one of the first beers to be distributed in a clear glass bottle and it is most readily associated with this form of dispense in the UK.\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale was originally created by Lieutenant Colonel James ('Jim') Herbert Porter (b. 1892, Burton upon Trent), a third-generation brewer at Newcastle Breweries, in 1927. Porter had served in the North Staffordshire Regiment in the First World War, earning his DSO with Bar before moving to Newcastle. Porter had refined the recipe for Newcastle Brown Ale alongside chemist Archie Jones over a period of three years. When Porter actually completed the beer, he believed it to be a failure, as he had actually been attempting to recreate Bass ale. The original beer had an original gravity of 1060º and was 6.25 ABV, and it sold at a premium price of 9 shillings for a dozen pint bottles.\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale went into production at Tyne Brewery in 1927, with Newcastle Breweries having occupied the site since 1890, with brewing on the site dating back to 1868.\n\nThe blue star logo was introduced to the Newcastle Brown Ale bottle in 1928, the year after the beer was launched. The five points of the star represent the five founding breweries of Newcastle.\n\nAfter the merger of Scottish Brewers with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, Newcastle Brown Ale became a flagship brand of Scottish & Newcastle alongside McEwan's Export and Younger's Tartan Special.\n\nBy 1997, Scottish and Newcastle claimed that it was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in both pubs and off licences in the country.\n\nDespite investing £16.6 million in a new bottling plant at the Tyne Brewery in 1999, Scottish and Newcastle announced its closure on 22 April 2004, in order to consolidate the brewing of beer and ale in the Federation Brewery site in Dunston, Gateshead, which was to pass to them with their £7.2m purchase of the Federation Brewery. The purchase and consolidation at Dunston created the new brewing company, Newcastle Federation Breweries.\n\nThe last production run of Brown Ale in Newcastle came off the Tyne Brewery line in May 2005. Pre-production trial brews were conducted at Dunston to ensure no change occurred in its taste after the move.\n\nThe Tyne Brewery site was bought by a consortium of Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council, and the regional development agency One NorthEast, as part of the wider Newcastle Science City project. Demolition of the former brewery began on 8 March 2007. The triggering of the controlled demolition of the former Barrack Road bottling plant opposite St James' Park was ceremonially performed by Sir Bobby Robson on 22 June 2008.\n\nBottling of Newcastle Brown Ale moved to the John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in 2007.\n\nHeineken bought Scottish and Newcastle in a joint deal with Carlsberg in 2008.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Scottish and Newcastle announced that it planned to close the Dunston brewery in 2010, moving production of Brown Ale to the John Smiths Brewery in Tadcaster. The company cited the general fall in the market for beer, over-capacity in its plants in general, and the fact that the Dunston site was currently operating at just 60% capacity — despite the fact that sales of Newcastle Brown Ale had never been higher — as reasons for the closure. The plan to close the brewery by the end of May 2010 was confirmed on 21 April 2010.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that caramel colouring, which has been used since the beer was launched, would be removed from the beer for health reasons. Instead, roasted malt would be used to darken the beer.\n\nIn 2017, Heineken announced that some production would move from the John Smith’s Brewery, Tadcaster, to the Zoeterwoude Brewery in the Netherlands. The company claimed this would allow for shorter order lead times and faster transportation to the U.S. and allow distributors to purchase by the pallet rather than the container.\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale is brewed with pale malt and crystal malt. It has a lower hopping rate than traditional English bitters.\n\nThe beer is one of the United Kingdom's leading bottled ales and is in the top 20 highest-selling ales overall, selling around annually. At the time of brewing moving to Dunston in 2005, Newcastle Brown was being exported to 41 countries. At times, over half of the brewery's output is directed overseas to the U.S. In 2010, more than the beer were sold in the United States, more than double the 2001 total. In the United States the beer is available in bottles and in keg. Newcastle Brown is also distributed in cans in the U.S., but is very rare.\n\nIn Canada and France (Brittany), the beer is available in short and tall bottles and in cans. The beer is also available in British-themed pubs as a draught beer in Australia and New Zealand, brewed in the UK and imported by World Brands Australia Pty Ltd. The UK-brewed bottled, kegs, and cans are widely available in Australian liquor outlets as part of their international range. It is also popular in Canada, available on draught at many British-themed pubs.\n\nIn 2000, the beer was renamed \"Newcastle Brown\" with the \"Ale\" being removed from the front label. This change, only in the UK, was due to market research claiming that the term \"ale\" was outdated and costing the company sales in the youth drinking markets. The older name was reinstated with no fanfare in 2004, when it was realised that the change had made no difference to sales.\n\nIn the North East, Newcastle Brown Ale is often given the nickname \"Dog\", alluding to the British euphemism of seeing a man about a dog. It is also known as Broon, \"brown\" pronounced in the Geordie dialect. Elsewhere in the UK, it is known as Newkie Brown.\n\nNewcastle Brown Ale is traditionally sold in Britain in and, more recently, bottles. Typically, the ale is consumed from a Wellington glass. This allows the drinker to regularly top-up the beer and thereby maintain a frothy \"head\". In the United States, it is sold in servings. In April 2010, Heineken USA introduced the Wellington glass, branded as the \"Geordie Schooner,\" for Newcastle Brown Ale consumers in America. The glass features a nucleated base.\n\nLike many British breweries, Newcastle Brown is strongly associated with its local area, in this case north east England. While the name provides a lot of this, the sponsorship of Newcastle United and the depiction of the River Tyne in the blue star has helped ensure its association. Its local provenance gave the brand an association with \"hardy, working class traditions and values\".\n\nUnder the European Union Protected Geographical Status laws introduced in 1992, the name Newcastle Brown Ale was granted protected brand status in February 2000. In late 2007 this was removed when brewing of the beer moved wholly away from its place of origin to Tadcaster in Yorkshire. The company was obliged to make a formal application to cancel it.\n\nThe closure of S&N's Dunston brewery in May 2010 left Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool as the only remaining significant volume brewery based in the North East of England.\n\nWhen the Australian brewer Elders IXL launched a takeover bid for Scottish and Newcastle, locals of Newcastle began the \"Keep Us on Top!\" campaign. As a sign of solidarity, the Newcastle Brown label was inverted until the takeover was quashed.\n\nIn 2005, the last 3,000 bottles produced in Newcastle were given commemorative labels \"121 years of brewing history, last bottles produced at Tyne Brewery April 2005.\" and given to the brewery staff.\n\nIn 2006, a special production run of 2.5 million bottles celebrated the career of Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who had recently broken the club's scoring record and was about to retire from football. The brewery produced the special editions featuring Newcastle United's black and white stripes and Shearer's portrait, in exchange for a donation to Shearer's testimonial match, and they went on sale from 17 April that year.\n\nIn 2007, a special edition was released to celebrate local rock band Maxïmo Park. The label was designed by the band and the beer released to coincide with the band's concert at Newcastle Metro Radio Arena on 15 December. Also in 2007, a special 80th anniversary themed bottle was distributed.\n\nIn 2013, Newcastle partnered with Taxi Magic to brew a Black Ale called \"Newcastle Cabbie\" as part of an Anti-Drunk Driving campaign.\n\nNewcastle Exhibition is a draught pasteurised keg beer (4.3% ABV) first introduced in 1929 and commonly found around the Newcastle area.\n\nNewcastle Amber Ale (1032 OG) was a light ale available until the 1980s. It was a diluted version of Exhibition. Amber Ale and a much stronger aged stock beer were formerly blended to create Newcastle Brown Ale. This method was discontinued sometime before the brand was moved to Dunston.\n\nNewcastle Star was a strong bottled beer (7.5% ABV) available from 1999 to 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Summer Ale in bottles. In 2011, Heineken USA launched Newcastle Werewolf (fall ale) and Winter IPA. In 2012, Heineken USA will introduce Newcastle Founders ale (an Extra Special Bitter style) as their spring seasonal.\n\nIn 2012, Summer Ale (4.4%) and Founder's Ale (4.8%) were launched in Tesco across the UK.\n\nIn winter 2012, Newcastle winter ale (5.2%) and Newcastle nocturnal ale (4.5%) were also launched in Tesco stores across the UK.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37969", "title": "Ramen", "text": "Ramen\n\nRamen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. Ramen was first introduced to Japan in 1660s by Zhu Shun Shui. It was also said that Ramen was introduced by Chinese immigrants in the late 19th or early 20th century. According to the record of the Yokohama Ramen Museum, ramen originated in China and made its way over to Japan in 1859. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork.\n\nThe word \"ramen\" is a Japanese transcription of the Chinese \"lamian\" (拉麵). In 1910, a Chinese restaurant serving ramen in Yokohama's Chinatown received public praise in Japan. Until the 1950s, ramen was called \"shina soba\" (支那そば, literally \"Chinese soba\") but today \"chūka soba\" (中華そば, also meaning \"Chinese soba\") or just \"ramen\" (ラーメン) are more common, as the word \"支那\" (\"shina\", meaning \"China\") has acquired a pejorative connotation.\n\nBy 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple ramen dish of noodles (cut rather than hand-pulled), a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyōza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a \"charumera\" (チャルメラ, from the Portuguese \"charamela\") to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Shōwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.\n\nAccording to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop opened in Yokohama in 1910.\n\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Taiwan. The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages. From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule. Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending, flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters locally referred to as \"yakuza\" who extorted vendors for protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation. In the same period, millions of Japanese troops returned from China and continental East Asia from their posts in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles. By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out \"yatai\" starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks. Ramen \"yatai\" provided a rare opportunity for small scale postwar entrepreneurship. The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein. The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture. Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.\n\nIn 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Chinese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world from many perspectives. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.\n\nToday ramen is arguably one of Japan's most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops, and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan. \"Tsuta\", a ramen restaurant in Tokyo’s Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.\n\nA wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor-specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Ramen can be broadly categorized by its two main ingredients: noodles and broth.\n\nMost noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and (from ) a type of alkaline mineral water, containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid.\n\nThe \"kansui\" is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles, and originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contained large amounts of these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with \"kansui\" lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture. Eggs may also be substituted for \"kansui\". Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor \"kansui\" and should only be used for yakisoba, as they have a weaker structure and are more prone to soaking up moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup.\n\nRamen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.\n\nTraditionally Ramen noodles were made manually, but with growing popularity many Ramen restaurants prefer to have in-house capacity to produce fresh noodles to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic Ramen making machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid. 20th century produced by such Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.\n\nRamen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients such as kombu (kelp), katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, pork bones, shiitake, and onions. Some modern Ramen broths can also be vegetable based. \n\nThe resulting combination is generally divided into four categories. (although new and original variations often make this categorization less clear-cut) Described from old ones.\n\nAfter basic preparation, ramen can be seasoned and flavored with any number of toppings, including but not limited to:\n\nSeasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic. Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.\n\nMost tonkotsu ramen restaurants offer a system known as \"kae-dama\" (替え玉), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a \"refill\" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.\n\nWhile standard versions of ramen are available throughout Japan since the Taisho era, the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations. Some of these which have gone on to national prominence are:\n\nSapporo, the capital of Hokkaido, is especially famous for its ramen. Most people in Japan associate Sapporo with its rich \"miso\" ramen, which was invented there and which is ideal for Hokkaido's harsh, snowy winters. Sapporo miso ramen is typically topped with sweetcorn, butter, bean sprouts, finely chopped pork, and garlic, and sometimes local seafood such as scallop, squid, and crab. Hakodate, another city of Hokkaido, is famous for its salt flavored ramen, while Asahikawa in the north of the island offers a soy sauce-flavored variation. In Muroran, many ramen restaurants offer Muroran curry ramen.\n\n\"'Kitakata ramen is known for its rather thick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork-and-niboshi broth. The area within the former city boundaries has the highest per-capita number of ramen establishments. Ramen has such prominence in the region that locally, the word \"soba\" usually refers to ramen, and not to actual soba which is referred to as \"nihon soba\" (\"Japanese soba\").\n\nTokyo style ramen consists of slightly thin, curly noodles served in a soy-flavored chicken broth. The Tokyo style broth typically has a touch of \"dashi\", as old ramen establishments in Tokyo often originate from soba eateries. Standard toppings are chopped scallion, menma, sliced pork, kamaboko, egg, nori, and spinach. Ikebukuro, Ogikubo and Ebisu are three areas in Tokyo known for their ramen.\n\nYokohama ramen specialty is called Ie-kei (家系). It consists of thick, straight-ish noodles served in a soy flavored pork broth similar to \"tonkotsu\". The standard toppings are roasted pork (chāshū), boiled spinach, sheets of nori, often with shredded Welsh onion (negi) and a soft or hard boiled egg. It is traditional for customers to call the softness of the noodles, the richness of the broth and the amount of oil they want.\n\nWakayama ramen in the Kansai region has a broth made from soy sauce and pork bones.\n\nHakata ramen originates from Hakata district of Fukuoka city in Kyushu. It has a rich, milky, pork-bone \"tonkotsu\" broth and rather thin, non-curly and resilient noodles. Often, distinctive toppings such as crushed garlic, \"beni shōga\" (pickled ginger), sesame seeds, and spicy pickled mustard greens (karashi takana) are left on tables for customers to serve themselves. Ramen stalls in Hakata and Tenjin are well-known within Japan. Recent trends have made Hakata ramen one of the most popular types in Japan, and several chain restaurants specializing in Hakata ramen can be found all over the country.\n\nThere are a number of related, Chinese-influenced noodle dishes in Japan. The following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments. They do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally Japanese, such as soba or udon, which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen.\n\nRamen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops, \"izakaya\" drinking establishments, lunch cafeterias, karaoke halls, and amusement parks. However, the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist \"ramen-ya\" restaurants. Some restaurants also provide Halal ramen (using chicken) in Osaka and Kyoto.\nAs \"ramen-ya\" restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes, they tend to lack variety in the menu. Besides ramen, some of the dishes generally available in a \"ramen-ya\" restaurant include other dishes from Japanese Chinese cuisine such as fried rice (called \"Chahan\" or \"Yakimeshi\"), \"gyoza\" (Chinese dumplings), and beer. \"Ramen-ya\" interiors are often filled with Chinese-inspired decorations.\n\nRamen became popular in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where it is known as rìshì lāmiàn (, lit. \"Japanese-style lamian\"). Restaurant chains serve ramen alongside distinctly Japanese dishes, such as tempura and yakitori. Interestingly, in Japan, these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen, but gyoza, kara-age and others from Japanese Chinese cuisine.\n\nIn Korea, ramen is called \"ramyeon\" (). There are different varieties, such as kimchi-flavored \"ramyeon\". While usually served with vegetables such as carrots and green onions, or eggs, some restaurants serve variations of \"ramyeon\" containing additional ingredients such as dumplings, tteok, or cheese as topping.\n\nOutside of Asia, there are restaurants specialising in Japanese-style foods like ramen noodles, especially in areas with a large demand for Asian cuisine. For example, Wagamama, a UK-based restaurant chain serving pan-Asian food, serves a ramen noodle soup. Jinya Ramen Bar serves tonkotsu ramen in the United States and Canada.\n\nInstant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name \"Oodles of Noodles\". One year later, it was re-branded \"Nissin Cup Noodles\", packaged in a foam food container (It is referred to as Cup Ramen in Japan), and subsequently saw a growth in international sales. Over time, the term \"ramen\" became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles. While some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions, including diabetes and stroke, especially in women, those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor.\n\nThe Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum is a unique museum about ramen, located in the Shin-Yokohama district of Kōhoku-ku, Yokohama.\n\nIn Akihabara, vending machines distribute warm ramen in a steel can, known as . It is produced by a popular ramen restaurant and contains noodles, soup, menma, and pork. It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small folded plastic fork. There are few kinds of flavor such as \"tonkotsu\" and curry.\n\n"}
{"id": "38217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38217", "title": "Fnord", "text": "Fnord\n\n\"Fnord\" () is a word coined in 1965 by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill in the \"Principia Discordia\". It entered the popular culture after appearing in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" (1975) of satirical and parody conspiracy fiction novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. In these novels, the interjection \"fnord\" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened, and children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word \"fnord\". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the text in which it appears.\n\nThe word has been used in newsgroup and hacker culture to indicate irony, humor, or Surrealism. Placement at the end of a statement in brackets (\"fnord\") explicitly tags the intent, and may be so applied to any random or surreal sentence, coercive subtext, or anything jarringly out of context, intentional or not. It is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable in programming. Fnord appears in the Church of the SubGenius recruitment film \"Arise!\" and has been used in the SubGenius newsgroup alt.slack.\n\nThe word was coined as a nonsensical term with religious undertones in the Discordian parody of religious texts, \"Principia Discordia\" (1965) by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill, but was popularized by \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" (1975) of satirical conspiracy fiction novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. \"Illuminatus!\" was produced, in the United Kingdom, as a cycle of plays by anarchic theatre director Ken Campbell and his Jungian Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool. The plays further popularized the term.\n\nIn the novel trilogy (and the plays), the interjection \"fnord\" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened. Under the Illuminati program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word \"fnord\". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the text it appears in. The uneasiness and confusion create a perpetual low-grade state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.\n\nIn the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords— occurrences of the word \"fnord\"— are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a consumerist society. The exclusion of the text from rational consciousness also enables the Illuminati to publish messages to each other in newspapers, etc., without fear that other people will be aware of them. It is implied in the books that \"fnord\" is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.\n\nTo \"see the fnords\" means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other fighting words. The term may also be used to refer to the experience of becoming aware of a phenomenon's ubiquity after first observing it. The phrase \"I have seen the fnords\" was graffitied on a British railway bridge throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until the bridge was upgraded. The bridge, located between Earlsdon and Coventry city centre, is known locally as \"Anarchy Bridge\". The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel \"A Touch of Love\" by Jonathan Coe.\n\nThe lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a placeholder word (a metasyntactic variable) in computer programming, particularly by those with ties to Discordianism or the Church of the SubGenius. It has also been found useful as the name for a \"techno cultural\" conference, computer programs, and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38221", "title": "Shit", "text": "Shit\n\nShit is a word generally considered to be vulgar and profane in Modern English. As a noun, it refers to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate; in the plural (\"the shits\"), it means diarrhoea. Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English. As a slang term, it has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality, trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person. It could also be used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, surprise or anger.\n\nThe word is likely derived from Old English, having the nouns \"scite\" (dung, attested only in place names) and \"scitte\" (diarrhoea) and the verb \"scītan\" (to defecate, attested only in \"bescītan\", to cover with excrement); eventually it morphed into Middle English \"schītte\" (excrement), \"schyt\" (diarrhoea) and \"shiten\" (to defecate), and it is virtually certain that it was used in some form by preliterate Germanic tribes at the time of the Roman Empire. The word may be further traced to Proto-Germanic *\"skit\"-, and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *\"skheid\"- \"cut, separate\", the same root believed to have become the word \"shed\". The word has several cognates in modern Germanic languages, such as German \"Scheiße\", Dutch \"schijt\", Swedish \"skit\", Icelandic \"skítur\", Norwegian \"skitt\" etc. Ancient Greek had 'skōr' (gen. 'skatos' hence 'scato-'), from Proto-Indo-European *\"sker\"-, which is likely unrelated.\n\nThe word \"shit\" (also \"shite\" in British and Hiberno-English) is usually avoided in formal speech. Minced oath substitutes for the word \"shit\" in English include \"shoot\", \"shucks\", \"sugar\", and the euphemistic backronym, \"Sugar, Honey, Ice(d) Tea\".\n\nIn the word's literal sense, it has a rather small range of common usages. An unspecified or collective occurrence of feces is generally \"shit\" or \"some shit\"; a single deposit of feces is sometimes \"a shit\" or \"a piece of shit\"; and to defecate is \"to shit\" or \"to take a shit\". While it is common to speak of shit as existing in \"a pile\", \"a load\", \"a hunk\", and other quantities and configurations, such expressions flourish most strongly in the figurative. For practical purposes, when actual defecation and excreta are spoken of, it is either through creative euphemism or with a vague and fairly rigid literalism.\n\n\"Piece of shit\" may also be used figuratively to describe a particularly loathsome individual, or an object that is of poor quality (\"this car is a \"piece of shit\"\", often abbreviated to \"P.O.S.\").\n\nOne recent study argued that \"shit studies\" is a cross-disciplinary meta-field of rhetorical inquiry about human communication and reasoning. The authors explained, \"rhetorical studies has theorized 'shit' in terms of the communication of transformation, style, and textual relations,\" particularly in relation to claims of expertise to topics such as \"anti-semitism\" and \"wine-tasting.\" They conclude that bullshit speech is one-sided discourse that is difficult to penetrate because it contains \"ideological barriers to the expectation of mutuality,\" working to deflect critical responses. \n\n\"Shit\" can be used as a generic mass noun similar to \"stuff\"; for instance, \"This show is funny (as) shit\" or \"This test is hard (as) shit\", or \"That was stupid shit\". These three usages (with \"funny\", \"hard\", and \"stupid\" or another synonym of \"stupid\") are heard most commonly in the United States. Using \"as\" denotes a subtle change in the meaning of the expression; however, the overall intent is basically the same.\n\nIn the expression \"Get your shit together!\" the word \"shit\" can refer either to one's wits or composure or to one's things, gear, etc. \"He doesn't have his shit together\" means that his affairs are disordered, reflecting not bad luck or forces beyond his control, but his personal shortcomings.\n\nTo \"shoot the shit\" is to have a friendly but pointless conversation, as in \"Come by my place some time and we'll shoot the shit.\"\n\nA \"shithole\" is any unpleasant place to be, much like a hellhole. This usage originates from a reference to a pit toilet.\n\nThe phrase \"built like a brick shithouse\" is used in the United States to compliment a curvaceous woman, but in other English-speaking countries to compliment men with athletic physiques. This meaning originates from the observation that most shithouses are rather ramshackle affairs constructed of plywood or scrap sheets of steel. \n\n\"The shitter\" is a slang term for a toilet, and can be used like the phrase \"...down the toilet\" to suggest that something has been wasted. Example: \"This CD player quit working one friggin' week after I bought it, and I lost the receipt! Twenty bucks right down the shitter!\"\n\n\"Shit on a shingle\" is U.S. military slang for creamed chipped beef on toast. In polite company this can be abbreviated as \"SOS\".\n\n\"To shit oneself\" or \"to be scared shitless\" can be used to refer to surprise or fear, usually figuratively. \n\n\"Shit\" can be used to denote trouble, by saying one is in \"a lot of shit\" or \"deep shit\" (a common euphemism is \"deep doo-doo\"). It's common for someone to refer to an unpleasant thing as \"hard shit\" (\"You got a speeding ticket? Man, that's some hard shit\"), but the phrase \"tough shit\" is used as an unsympathetic way of saying \"too bad\" to whoever is having problems (\"You got arrested? Tough shit, man!\") or as a way of expressing to someone that they need to stop complaining about something and cope with it instead (Billy: \"I got arrested because of you!\" Tommy: \"Tough shit, dude, you knew you might get arrested when you chose to come with me.\") Note that in this case, as in many cases with the term, \"tough shit\" is often said as a way of pointing out someone's fault in his/her own current problem. It's also common to express annoyance by simply saying \"Shit\".\n\n\"Up shit creek\" or especially \"Up shit creek without a paddle\" describes a situation in which one is in severe difficulties with no apparent means of solution (this is simply a profane version of the older saying \"up the creek without a paddle\", profanity added for emphasis or humor).\n\n\"Shit happens\" means that bad happenings in life are inevitable. This is usually spoken with a sigh or a shrug, but can be spoken derisively to someone who complains too often about his ill fortunes, or in an irritating manner.\n\n\"When the shit hits the fan\" is usually used to refer to a specific time of confrontation or trouble, which requires decisive action. This is often used in reference to combat situations and the action scenes in movies, but can also be used for everyday instances that one might be apprehensive about. \"I don't want to be here when the shit hits the fan!\" indicates that the speaker is dreading this moment (which can be anything from an enemy attack to confronting an angry parent or friend). Often reduced to \"when it hits the fan\" in polite society. \"He's the one to turn to when the shit hits the fan\" is an indication that the person being talked about is dependable and will not run from trouble or abandon their allies in tough situations. The concept of this phrase is simple enough, as the actual substance striking the rotating blades of a fan would cause a messy and unpleasant situation (much like being in the presence of a manure spreader). Whether or not this has actually happened, or if the concept is simply feasible enough for most people to imagine the result without needing it to be demonstrated, is unknown. Another example might be the saying \"shit rolls downhill\", a metaphor suggesting that trouble for a manager may be transferred to the subordinates. There are a number of anecdotes and jokes about such situations, as the imagery of these situations is considered to be funny. This is generally tied-in with the concept that disgusting and messy substances spilled onto someone else are humorous.\n\n\"Shit\" can comfortably stand in for the terms \"bad\" and \"anything\" in many instances (\"Dinner was good, but the movie was shit.\" \"You're all mad at me, but I didn't do shit!\"). A comparison can also be used, as in \"Those pants look like shit\", or \"This stuff tastes like shit\". Many usages are idiomatic. \"I'm shit out of luck\" usually refers to someone who is at the end of their wits or who has no remaining viable options. In polite company the acronym \"SOL\" is commonly substituted for this. \"That little shit shot me in the ass\", suggests a mischievous or contemptuous person. Euphemisms such as \"crap\" are not usually used in this context.\n\nThe exclamations \"oh shit!\" and \"aw shit!\" are used to express displeasure (sometimes facetiously) with oneself when one makes a mistake, especially a stupid or avoidable mistake. When used to comment on the actions of someone else, they can take on a more humorous quality if the mistake does not result in serious consequences.\n\nThe term \"piece of shit\" is generally used to classify a product or service as being sufficiently below the writer's understanding of generally accepted quality standards to be of negligible and perhaps even negative value. The term \"piece of shit\" has greater precision than \"shit\" or \"shitty\" in that \"piece of shit\" identifies the low quality of a specific component or output of a process without applying a derogatory slant to the entire process. For example, if one said \"\"The inner city youth orchestra has been a remarkably successful initiative in that it has kept young people off the streets after school and exposed them to culture and discipline, thereby improving their self esteem and future prospects. The fact that the orchestra's recent rendition of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony in B minor was pretty much a piece of shit should not in any way detract from this.\"\" The substitution of \"shit\" or \"shitty\" for \"pretty much a piece of shit\" would imply irony and would therefore undermine the strength of the statement.\n\nThe term \"I don't/doesn't give a shit\" can be used when one does not care about something, or has a passive attitude toward said thing, as it denotes indifference. In context, one can say: \"\"You're offended? Well, I don't give a shit!\"\" or \"\"You're telling me? Go find somebody who gives a shit.\"\"\n\n\"Whale shit\" is sometimes used to describe a person who inspires displeasure or disgust, as in: \"\"You're lower than whale shit at the bottom of the ocean!\"\"\n\n“You can’t polish shit” is a popular aphorism roughly equivalent to \"putting Lipstick on a pig\" (although \"a turd\" is more commonly used).\n\n\"Shit\" can also be used to establish superiority over another being. The most common phrase is \"eat shit!\" expressing hatred of the addressee. Some other personal word may be added such as \"eat my shit\" implying truly personal connotations. As an aside, the above is actually a contraction of the phrase \"eat shit and die!\". It is often said without commas as a curse; they command the other party to perform exactly those actions in that order. However, the term was originally \"Eat, Shit, and Die\" naming the three most basic things humans have to do, and it is common among soldiers.\n\nThe phrase \"You ain't shit\", expresses an air of intimidation over the addressee, expressing that they mean nothing or are worthless.\n\n\"Hot shit\" can be a reference to a matter or thing of supreme importance or urgency (\"This report is really hot shit!\"). It can be used in adjectival form: \"This memo's shit-hot!\". \"Hot shit\" can also refer to a person who either overestimates his own worth or ability, or is highly estimated by others (\"He thinks he's some hot shit!\" or \"He's one hot shit!\"). In polite company the euphemism \"hotshot\" may be substituted when referring to a person.\n\nA speaker may indicate dominance through arrogance using the phrase \"His shit don't stink\" (though ungrammatical, this is the accepted diction). This conveys that the referent considers himself beyond reproach. For example: \"Those pompous assholes in Finance are the ones who laid low the company -- their shit don't even stink!\"\n\nIn North American slang, prefixing the article \"the\" to \"shit\" gives it a completely opposite definition, meaning \"the best\", as in \"Altered Beast is the shit\". Other slang words of the same meaning, such as \"crap\", are not used in such locutions.\n\nThe expression \"no shit?\" (a contraction of \"no bullshit?\") is used in response to a statement that is extraordinary or hard to believe. Alternatively the maker of the hard-to-believe statement may add \"no shit\" to reinforce the sincerity or truthfulness of their statement, particularly in response to someone expressing disbelief at their statement. \"No shit\" is also used sarcastically in response to a statement of the obvious, as in \"no shit, Sherlock\".\n\nIn this form the word can also be used in phrases such as \"don't give me that shit\" or \"you're full of shit\". The term \"full of shit\" is often used as an exclamation to charge someone who is believed to be prone to dishonesty, exaggeration or is thought to be \"phoney\" with an accusation. For example:\n\n\nThe word \"bullshit\" also denotes false or insincere discourse. (\"Horseshit\" is roughly equivalent, while \"chickenshit\" means \"cowardly\", \"batshit\" indicates a person is crazy, and \"going apeshit\" indicates a person is entering a state of high excitement or unbridled rage.) \"Are you shitting me?!\" is a question sometimes given in response to an incredible assertion. An answer that reasserts the veracity of the claim is, \"I shit you not\".\n\nPerhaps the only constant connotation that \"shit\" reliably carries is that its referent holds some degree of emotional intensity for the speaker. Whether offense is taken at hearing the word varies greatly according to listener and situation, and is related to age and social class: elderly speakers and those of (or aspiring to) higher socioeconomic strata tend to use it more privately and selectively than younger and more blue-collar speakers.\n\nLike the word \"fuck\", \"shit\" is often used to add emphasis more than to add meaning, for example, \"shit! I was so shit-scared of that shithead that I shit-talked him into dropping out of the karate match!\" The term \"to shit-talk\" connotes bragging or exaggeration (whereas \"to talk shit\" primarily means \"to gossip [about someone in a damaging way]\" or to talk in a boastful way about things which are erroneous in nature), but in such constructions as the above, the word \"shit\" often functions as an interjection.\n\nThe exclamation \"holy shit\" derives its force from the juxtaposition of the sacred with the profane.\n\nUnlike the word \"fuck\", \"shit\" is not used emphatically with \"-ing\" or as an infix. For example; \"I lost the shitting karate match\" would be replaced with \"...the fucking karate match\". Similarly, while \"in-fucking-credible\" is generally acceptable, \"in-shitting-credible\" is not.\n\nThe preterite and past participle of \"shit\" are attested as \"shat\", \"shit\", or \"shitted\", depending on dialect and, sometimes, the rhythm of the sentence. In the prologue of \"The Canterbury Tales\", \"shitten\" is used as the past participle; however this form is not used in modern English. In American English \"shit\" as a past participle is often correct, while \"shat\" is generally acceptable and \"shitted\" is uncommon and missing from the \"Random House\" and \"American Heritage\" dictionaries.\n\nThe backronym form \"S.H.I.T.\" often figures into jokes, like \"Special High Intensity Training\" (a well-known joke used in job applications), \"Special Hot Interdiction Team\" (a mockery on SWAT), \"Super Hackers Invitational Tournament,\" and any college name that begins with an S-H (like \"Sam Houston Institute of Technology\" or \"South Harmon Institute of Technology\" in the film \"Accepted\" (2006) or \"Store High In Transit\" in the film \"Kenny\" (2006)). \"South Hudson Institute of Technology\" has sometimes been used to describe the United States Military Academy at West Point. \"The Simpsons\"' Apu was a graduate student at \"Springfield Heights Institute of Technology\".\n\nIn polite company, sometimes backronyms such as \"Sugar Honey in Tea\" or \"Sugar Honey Ice(d) Tea\" are used.\n\nIn the ballet world, as in theater more generally, a superstition holds that it is bad luck to wish a performer \"good luck\" before a show (see \"break a leg\"). Instead, it is traditional to say \"merde\", which is French for \"shit\". The origin of this tradition is unknown, but may refer to the droppings left by the horses of the numerous carriages attending a popular performance, or alternatively may be derived from a warning to avoid stepping in manure from the days when dancers would often share a stage with performing animals.\n\nIn Canada, \"shit\" is one of the words considered by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council to be \"coarse, offensive language intended for adults\", acceptable for broadcast only after 9:00pm.\n\nOn the Canadian Showcase television show \"Trailer Park Boys\", characters frequently use the term \"shit\". For example, the fictional trailer park supervisor James \"Jim\" Lahey employs many metaphors with the negative slang \"shit\" bizarrely worked in; in one episode, Mr. Lahey likens Ricky's growing ignorance to that of a \"shit tsunami\", while in another episode, Mr. Lahey tells Bubbles the \"shit hawks are swooping in low\" due to his deplorable behavior and company. The term \"shit\" is also used in the titles of that show's episodes, themselves, e.g., \"The Winds of Shit\", \"A Shit Leopard Can't Change Its Spots\", and \"Never Cry Shitwolf\".\n\nOn Japanese TV, such as anime, that is aired on American television the words \"shit\"and \"bullshit\" are uncensored. This is probably because of the ambiguity of the Japanese word \"kuso\", which may also mean milder swear words like \"crap\", \"crud\", \"damn\", or \"darn\". It appears in subtitles from inaccurate translations or unsureness of its meaning.\n\nThe first person to say \"shit\" on British TV was John Cleese of the \"Monty Python\" comedy troupe, in the late 1960s, according to his own eulogy for Graham Chapman. However, this is not independently verified. The phrase \"thick as pigshit\" is used in the 1969 BBC play \"The Big Flame\". The word \"shit\" also appears in the British film \"Cul-de-sac\" (1966), which might pre-date John Cleese's use.\n\nThe word has become increasingly acceptable on American cable television and satellite radio, which are not subject to FCC regulation. In other English-speaking countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the word is allowed to be used in broadcast television by the regulative councils of each area, as long as it is used in late hours when young people are not expected to be watching. It has appeared on ABC News' \"20/20.\"\n\n\"Shit\" was one of the original \"Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV\", a comedy routine by the American comedian George Carlin. In the United States, although the use of the word is censored on broadcast network television (while its synonym \"crap\" is not usually subject to censorship), the FCC permitted some exceptions. For example:\n\nSince that episode, the word has become a mainstay of \"South Park\" and other Comedy Central series, along with programming on other cable networks including FX, TBS, and as of March 2014, Adult Swim. Episodes of \"Graceland\", on the USA Network, also use \"shit\" regularly.\n\nUnlike satellite radio, American terrestrial radio stations must abide by FCC guidelines on obscenity to avoid punitive fines. These guidelines do not define exactly what constitutes obscenity, but it has been interpreted by some commissioners as including any form of words like \"shit\" and \"fuck\", for whatever use.\n\nDespite this, the word has been featured in popular songs that have appeared on broadcast radio in cases where the usage of the word is not audibly clear to the casual listener, or on live television. For example:\n\nSome notable instances of censorship of the word from broadcast television and radio include:\n\nUsing the term \"shit\" (or other locally used crude words) - rather than feces or excreta - during campaigns and triggering events is a deliberate aspect of the community-led total sanitation approach which aims to stop open defecation, a massive public health problem in developing countries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38537", "title": "Yorkshire pudding", "text": "Yorkshire pudding\n\nYorkshire pudding is a common English side dish consisting of a baked pudding made from batter consisting of eggs, flour, and milk or water. It is a versatile food that can be served in numerous ways depending on the choice of ingredients, the size of the pudding and the accompanying components of the dish. As a first course it can be served with onion gravy. For a main course it is often served with beef and gravy and is part of the traditional Sunday roast, but can also be filled with foods such as bangers and mash to make a meal. \nWhen wheat flour began to come into common use for making cakes and puddings, cooks in the north of England devised a means of making use of the fat that dropped into the dripping pan to cook a batter pudding while the meat roasted. In 1737, a recipe for \"a dripping pudding\" (later named \"The Yorkshire Pudding\") was published in the book \"The Whole Duty of a Woman\":\n\nSimilar instructions were published during 1747 in the book \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse, with the name 'Yorkshire pudding'. It was she who renamed the original version, known as Dripping Pudding, which had been cooked in England for centuries, although these puddings were much flatter than the puffy versions made today. William Sitwell suggests that the pudding got the name 'Yorkshire' due to the regions association with coal and the higher temperatures this produced which helped to make the batter crispier.\n\nOriginally the Yorkshire pudding was served as a first course with thick gravy to dull the appetite with the low-cost ingredients so that the diners would not eat so much of the more expensive meat in the next course. An early recipe appeared in Sir Alexander William George Cassey's \"The Whole Duty of a Woman\" during 1737.\nBecause the rich gravy from the roast meat drippings was used up with the first course, the main meat and vegetable course was often served with a parsley or white sauce.\n\nIn poorer households, the pudding was often served as the only course. Using dripping, a simple meal was made with flour, eggs and milk. This was traditionally eaten with a gravy or sauce, to moisten the pudding.\n\nThe Yorkshire pudding is meant to rise. The Royal Society of Chemistry suggested in 2008 that \"A Yorkshire pudding isn't a Yorkshire pudding if it is less than four inches tall\".\n\nYorkshire pudding is cooked by pouring a batter made from milk (or water), flour and eggs into preheated, oiled, baking pans, ramekins or muffin tins (in the case of miniature puddings). A basic formula uses cup flour and cup liquid per egg. Water produces a lighter crisper but less sweet pudding than using milk. They can also be baked in the oven in muffin tins. A 1926 recipe involves covering the pudding with greaseproof paper to steam it and then serving it with jam, butter and sugar.\n\nOther foods made from batter include popovers, gougère (a savoury pastry), Dutch baby pancakes, toad in the hole, and takoyaki (a Japanese puff batter dumpling with octopus).\n\nNational Yorkshire Pudding Day has been celebrated on the first Sunday in February in Britain since 2007. It is celebrated on 13 October in the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "38879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38879", "title": "Panettone", "text": "Panettone\n\nPanettone (pronounced ; ) is an Italian type of sweet bread loaf originally from Milan (in the local Milanese dialect it is called \"panetton\", ), usually prepared and enjoyed for Christmas and New Year in Western, Southern, and Southeastern Europe as well as in Brazil, the Horn of Africa, Australia, and to a lesser extent in former French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies.\n\nIt has a cupola shape, which extends from a cylindrical base and is usually about 12–15 cm high for a panettone weighing 1 kg. Other bases may be used, such as an octagon, or a frustum with a star section shape more common to pandoro. It is made during a long process that involves curing the dough, which is acidic, similar to sourdough. The proofing process alone takes several days, giving the cake its distinctive fluffy characteristics. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked. Many other variations are available such as plain or with chocolate. It is served in wedge shapes, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine, such as Asti or Moscato d'Asti. In some regions of Italy, it is served with \"crema di mascarpone\", a cream made from mascarpone, eggs, sometimes dried or candied fruits, and typically a sweet liqueur such as amaretto; if mascarpone cheese is unavailable, zabaione is sometimes used as a substitute.\n\nEfforts are under way to obtain Protected Designation of Origin and Denominazione di origine controllata status for this product, but these have not yet been successful. Former Italian Agriculture Minister Paolo De Castro was known to be looking at ways to protect genuine Italian cakes from growing competition in South America, and exploring whether action could be taken at the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn the early 20th century, two enterprising Milanese bakers began to produce panettone in large quantities in the rest of Italy. In 1919, Angelo Motta started producing his eponymous brand of cakes. It was also Motta who revolutionised the traditional panettone by giving it its tall domed shape by making the dough rise three times, for almost 20 hours, before cooking, giving it its now-familiar light texture. The recipe was adapted shortly after by another baker, Gioacchino Alemagna, around 1925, who also gave his name to a popular brand that still exists today. The stiff competition between the two that then ensued led to industrial production of the cake. Nestlé took over the brands together in the late 1990s, but Bauli, an Italian bakery company based in Verona, has acquired Motta and Alemagna from Nestlé.\n\nBy the end of World War II, panettone was cheap enough for anyone and soon became the country's leading Christmas sweet. Lombard immigrants to Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil also brought their love of panettone, and panettone is enjoyed for Christmas with hot cocoa or liquor during the holiday season, which became a mainstream tradition in those countries. In some places, it replaces the king cake.\n\nPanettone is widely available in South America, including in Argentina, Brazil, Chile (see: Pan de Pascua), Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru. It is known in Spanish as \"panetón\" or \"pan dulce\", and as \"panetone\" in Brazilian Portuguese. Peru's Antonio D'Onofrio, son of immigrants hailing from Caserta, Italy, spawned his own brand using a modified form of the Alemagna formula (e.g., candied papaya is used instead of candied citron and lemon, as these fruits are not available in Peru), which he licensed along with the packaging style. This brand is now also owned by Nestlé and exported throughout South America. In recent years, Brazilian \"panetone\" have increased in quality and in popularity due to their low cost and abundance.\n\nItalian food manufacturing companies and bakeries produce 117 million panettone and pandoro cakes every Christmas, collectively worth 579 million euros. There is an event held in Milan since 2013 that awards the Best Traditional Panettone of Italy. In 2016, the prize was awarded to Giuseppe Zippo, from Salento.\n\nPanettone is popular within Italian communities around the world, and can commonly be found in Italian grocery stores in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK.\n\nIn Italy, panettone comes with an often varied history, but one that invariably states that its birthplace was Milan. The word \"panettone\" derives from the Italian word \"panetto\", a small loaf cake. The augmentative Italian suffix \"-one\" changes the meaning to \"large cake\".\n\nThe origins of this cake appear to be ancient, dating back to the Roman Empire, when ancient Romans sweetened a type of leavened cake with honey.\n\nThroughout the ages, this \"tall, leavened fruitcake\" makes cameo appearances in the arts: It is shown in a sixteenth-century painting by Pieter Brueghel the Elder and is possibly mentioned in a contemporary recipe book written by Italian Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to popes and emperors during the time of Charles V. The first recorded association of panettone with Christmas can be found in the Italian writings of 18th century illuminist Pietro Verri. He refers to it as \"\"Pan de Ton\"\" (\"luxury bread\").\n\nThough the etymology of the word 'panettone' is rather mundane, three more complex and fanciful folk etymologies have arisen. It is also thought that one of the ecclesiastical brothers, Fr. Antonio, who always wore the proper hat, was fond of this \"pane\". The ecclesiastical hat Pane Tone was later adopted as the shape, which gave rise to Panettone. This derivation received credence and acceptability at the turn of the century, and is likely to be the foreunner of the more recent Christmas cake. Gianrian Carli in \"Il Caffè\" makes passing reference to panettone in 1850 in discussion with Pietro Verri and alludes to a clerical hat.\n\nOne theory suggests that the word derives from the Milanese, \"pan del ton\", meaning \"cake of luxury\".\n"}

It may consist of one of a variety of flavoured sausages made of pork, lamb, or beef (often specifically Cumberland sausage). The dish is sometimes served with onion gravy, fried onions, or peas.\nThis dish, even when cooked at home, may be thought of as an example of pub grub, meaning it is relatively quick and easy to make in large quantities. More up-market varieties, with exotic sausages and mashes, are sold in gastropubs, with less sophisticated alternatives being available in regular public houses (pubs).\n\nIn 2009, the dish was listed as Britain's most popular comfort food in a survey commissioned by TV channel \"Good Food\".\n\nAlthough it is sometimes stated that the term \"bangers\" has its origins in World War II, the term was actually in use at least as far back as 1919. The term \"bangers\" is attributed (in common usage in the UK) to the fact that sausages made during World War I, when there were meat shortages, were made with such a high water content that they were more liable to pop under high heat when cooked. The contraction of \"mashed potato\" to \"mashed\" rather than \"mash\" was common among the upper-middle and upper classes in Britain up to the mid-twentieth century, and was an example of U and non-U English.\n\n"}

Examples of electronic flutter are:\n\n\nIn the field of mechanics and structures, Aeroelastic flutter is an aeroelastic phenomenon where a body's own aerodynamic forces couple with its natural mode of vibration to produce rapid periodic motion.\nAeroelastic flutter occurs under steady flow conditions, when a structure's aerodynamic forces are affected by and in turn affect the movement of the structure. This sets up a positive feedback loop exciting the structure's free vibration. Flutter is self-starting and results in large amplitude vibration which often lead to rapid failure.\n\nThe aerodynamic conditions required for flutter vary with the structure's external design and flexibility, but can range from very low velocities to supersonic flows. Large or flexible structures such as pipes, suspension bridges, chimneys and tall buildings are prone to flutter. Designing to avoid flutter is a fundamental requirement for rigid airfoils (fixed wing aircraft and helicopters) as well as for aircraft propellers and gas turbine blades.\n\nPrediction of flutter prior to modern unsteady computational fluid dynamics was based on empirical testing. As a result, many pioneering designs failed due to unforeseen vibrations. The most famous of these was the opening of the original Tacoma Narrows Suspension Bridge in mid 1940, which failed spectacularly 4 months later during a sustained 67 km/h crosswind and became known as Galloping Gertie for its flutter movement.\n\nDuring the 1950s over 100 incidents were recorded of military or civilian aircraft being lost or damaged due to unforeseen flutter events.

{"id": "42801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42801", "title": "Nutella", "text": "Nutella\n\nNutella (; ) is a brand of sweetened hazelnut cocoa spread. Nutella is manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero and was first introduced in 1965, although its first iteration dates to 1963.\n\nPietro Ferrero owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial batch of \"Pasta Gianduja\". Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in 1951 as \"Supercrema\".\n\nIn 1963, Ferrero's son Michele Ferrero revamped \"Supercrema\" with the intention of marketing it throughout Europe. Its composition was modified, and it was renamed \"Nutella\". The first jar of Nutella left the factory in Alba on April 20, 1964. The product was an instant success and remains widely popular.\n\nIn 2012, French senator Yves Daudigny proposed a tax increase on palm oil from €100 to €400 per tonne. At 20 percent, palm oil is one of Nutella's main ingredients, and the tax was dubbed \"the Nutella tax\" in the media.\n\nOn 14 May 2014, Poste italiane issued a 50th anniversary Nutella commemorative stamp. The 70 Euro cent stamp was designed by Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato and features a jar of Nutella on a golden background. Ferrero held a Nutella Day on 17 and 18 May to celebrate the anniversary.\n\nThe main ingredients of Nutella are sugar and palm oil (greater than 50%). It also contains hazelnut at 13 %, cocoa solids, and skimmed milk. In the United States and the UK, Nutella contains soy products. Nutella is marketed as \"hazelnut cream\" in many countries. Under Italian law, it cannot be labeled as a \"chocolate cream\", as it does not meet minimum cocoa solids concentration criteria. Ferrero uses 25 percent of the global supply of hazelnuts.\n\nIn November 2017, the company modified the recipe slightly, increasing the sugar and skimmed milk powder content. Since the colour of the product is lighter in tone, the Hamburg Consumer Protection Center estimated that the cocoa content was also reduced. Some news outlets reported that the modification of the recipe led to consumers' being \"outraged\" or \"going nuts\".\n\nThe traditional Piedmont recipe, gianduja, was a mixture containing approximately 71.5 % hazelnut paste and 19.5 % chocolate. It was developed in Piedmont, Italy, due to a lack of cocoa beans after post-war rationing reduced availability of the raw material.\n\nEach country has a different ingredient list for the Nutella formula.\nSugar, vegetable oil, hazelnuts (13%), skim milk powder (8.7%) cocoa powder (7.4%), non-fat milk solids, emulsifier (soy lecithin), flavour (vanillin).\n\nSugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk powder, whey powder, lecithin, vanillin.\n\nFerrero has confirmed that it has changed the recipe of its chocolate and hazelnut spread – sparking a huge backlash among fans of the brand.\n\nSugar, vegetable oil, hazelnuts (13%), fat-reduced cocoa powder (7.4%), skimmed milk powder (5%), whey powder, emulsifier (lecithins) (soy), flavourant (vanillin).\n\nSugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin: an artificial flavor.\n\nNutella is produced in various facilities. In the North American market, it is produced at a plant in Brantford, Ontario in Canada and more recently in San José Iturbide, Guanajuato, Mexico.\n\nFor Australia and New Zealand, Nutella has been manufactured in Lithgow, New South Wales since the late 1970s.\n\nTwo of the four Ferrero plants in Italy produce Nutella, in Alba, Piedmont, and in Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi in Campania. In France, a production facility is located in Villers-Écalles. For Eastern Europe (including Southeast Europe, Poland, Turkey, Czech Republic and Slovakia) and South Africa, it is produced in Warsaw and Manisa. For Germany and northern Europe, Nutella is produced at the Ferrero plant in Stadtallendorf, which has been in existence since 1956.\n\nFerrero also has a plant in Poços de Caldas, Brazil, which supplies the Brazilian market, with part of the production being exported overseas.\n\nGlobal production in 2013 was about 350,000 tonnes.\n\nNutella is described as a chocolate and hazelnut spread, although it is mostly made of sugar and palm oil. The manufacturing process for this food item is very similar to a generic production of chocolate spread. Nutella is made from sugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa powder, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin.\n\nThe process of making this spread begins with the extraction of cocoa powder from the cocoa bean. These cocoa beans are harvested from cocoa trees and are left to dry for about ten days before being shipped for processing. Typically cocoa beans contain approximately 50 percent of cocoa butter; therefore, they must be roasted to reduce the cocoa bean into a liquid form. This step is not sufficient for turning cocoa bean into a chocolate paste because it solidifies at room temperature, and would not be spreadable. After the initial roast, the liquid paste is sent to presses, which are used to squeeze the butter out of the cocoa bean. The final products are round discs of chocolate made of pure compressed cocoa. The cocoa butter is transferred elsewhere so it can be used in other products.\n\nThe second process involves the hazelnuts. Once the hazelnuts have arrived at the processing plant, a quality control is issued to inspect the nuts so they are suitable for processing. A guillotine is used to chop the nuts to inspect the interior. After this process, the hazelnuts are cleaned and roasted. A second quality control is issued by a computer-controlled blast of air, which removes the bad nuts from the batch. This ensures that each jar of Nutella is uniform in its look and taste. Approximately 50 hazelnuts can be found in each jar of Nutella, as claimed by the company.\n\nThe cocoa powder is then mixed with the hazelnuts along with sugar, vanillin and skim milk in a large tank until it becomes a paste-like spread. Modified palm oil is then added to help retain the solid phase of the Nutella at room temperature, which substitutes for the butter found in the cocoa bean. Whey powder is then added to the mix to act as a binder for the paste. Whey powder is an additive commonly used in spreads to prevent the coagulation of the product because it stabilizes the fat emulsions. Similarly, lecithin, a form of a fatty substance found in animal and plant tissues, is added to help emulsify the paste as it promotes homogenized mixing of the different ingredients, allowing the paste to become spreadable. It also aids the lipophilic properties of the cocoa powder which, again, keeps the product from separating. Vanillin is added to enhance the sweetness of the chocolate. The finished product is then packaged.\n\nNutella contains 10.4 percent of saturated fat and 58 % of processed sugar by weight. A two-tablespoon (37-gram) serving of Nutella contains 200 calories including 99 calories from 11 grams of fat (3.5 g of which are saturated) and 80 calories from 21 grams of sugar. The spread also contains 15 mg of sodium and 2 g of protein per serving (for reference a Canadian serving size is 1 tablespoon or 19 grams).\n\nThe label states that Nutella does not need to be refrigerated. This is because the large quantity of sugar in the product acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. More specifically, the sugar acts as a preservative by binding the water in the product, which prevents the microorganisms from growing. Refrigeration causes Nutella to harden because it contains fats from the hazelnuts. When nut fats are placed in cold temperatures they become too hard to spread. Hazelnuts contain almost 91 percent monounsaturated fat, which are known to be liquid at room temperature and solidify at refrigerator temperatures. Room temperature allows the product to have a smooth and spreadable consistency because the monounsaturated oils from the hazelnut are liquid at this state. In addition, the palm oil used in Nutella does not require refrigeration because it contains high amounts of saturated fat and resists becoming rancid. The remaining ingredients in Nutella, such as cocoa, skimmed milk powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin, also do not require refrigeration.\n\nIn the United States, Ferrero was sued in a class action for false advertising leading to consumer inferences that Nutella has nutritional and health benefits (from advertising claims that Nutella was \"part of a nutritious breakfast\").\n\nIn April 2012, Ferrero agreed to pay a $3 million settlement (up to $4 per jar for up to five jars per customer). The settlement also required Ferrero to make changes to Nutella's labeling and marketing, including television commercials and their website.\n\n"}
{"id": "43444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43444", "title": "Simulation", "text": "Simulation\n\nA simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system; the act of simulating first requires a model is developed. This model is a well-defined description of the simulated subject, and represents its key characteristics, such as its behaviour, functions and abstract or physical properties. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents its operation over time.\n\nSimulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.\n\nKey issues in simulation include the acquisition of valid source information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviours, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the field of computer simulation.\n\nHistorically, simulations used in different fields developed largely independently, but 20th-century studies of systems theory and cybernetics combined with spreading use of computers across all those fields have led to some unification and a more systematic view of the concept.\n\n\"Physical simulation\" refers to simulation in which physical objects are substituted for the real thing (some circles use the term for computer simulations modelling selected laws of physics, but this article does not). These physical objects are often chosen because they are smaller or cheaper than the actual object or system.\n\n\"Interactive simulation\" is a special kind of physical simulation, often referred to as a \"human in the loop\" simulation, in which physical simulations include human operators, such as in a flight simulator, sailing simulator, or a driving simulator.\n\n\"Continuous simulation\" is a simulation where time evolves continuously based on numerical integration of Differential Equations.\n\n\"Discrete Event Simulation\" is a simulation where time evolves along events that represent critical moments, while the values of the variables are not relevant between two of them or result trivial to be computed in case of necessity\n\n\"Stochastic Simulation\" is a simulation where some variable or process is regulated by stochastic factors and estimated based on Monte Carlo techniques using pseudo-random numbers, so replicated runs from same boundary conditions are expected to produce different results within a specific confidence band \n\n\"Deterministic Simulation\" is a simulation where the variable is regulated by deterministic algorithms, so replicated runs from same boundary conditions produce always identical results.\n\n\"Hybrid Simulation\" (sometime Combined Simulation) corresponds to a mix between Continuous and Discrete Event Simulation and results in integrating numerically the differential equations between two sequential events to reduce the number of discontinuities \n\n\"Stand Alone Simulation\" is a Simulation running on a single workstation by itself.\n\n\"Distributed Simulation\" is operating over distributed computers in order to guarantee access from/to different resources (e.g. multi-users operating different systems, or distributed data sets); a classical example is Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) \n\n\"Parallel Simulation\" is executed over multiple processors usually to distribute the computational workload as it is happening in High-Performance Computing \n\n\"Interoperable Simulation\" where multiple models, simulators (often defined as Federates) interoperate locally on distributed over a network; a classical example is High-Level Architecture.\n\n\"Modeling & Simulation as a Service\" where Simulation is accessed as a Service over the web.\n\n\"Modeling, interoperable Simulation and Serious Games\" where Serious Games Approaches (e.g. Game Engines and Engagement Methods) are integrated with Interoperable Simulation.\n\n\"Simulation Fidelity\" is used to describe the accuracy of a simulation and how closely it imitates the real-life counterpart. Fidelity is broadly classified as 1 of 3 categories: low, medium, and high. Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation but the following generalization can be made:\n\nHuman in the loop simulations can include a computer simulation as a so-called \"synthetic environment\".\n\n\"Simulation in failure analysis\" refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This was the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.\n\nA computer simulation (or \"sim\") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, predictions may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.\n\nComputer simulation has become a useful part of modeling many natural systems in physics, chemistry and biology, and human systems in economics and social science (e.g., computational sociology) as well as in engineering to gain insight into the operation of those systems. A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of network traffic simulation. In such simulations, the model behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.\n\nTraditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a mathematical model, which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible. There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.\n\nSeveral software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic modeling, multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.\n\nModern usage of the term \"computer simulation\" may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.\n\nIn computer science, simulation has some specialized meanings: Alan Turing used the term \"simulation\" to refer to what happens when a universal machine executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine. The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in theoretical computer science the term \"simulation\" is a relation between state transition systems, useful in the study of operational semantics.\n\nLess theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In computer architecture, a type of simulator, typically called an \"emulator\", is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see \"Computer architecture simulator\" and \"Platform virtualization\"). For example, simulators have been used to debug a microprogram or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer's operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.\n\nSimulators may also be used to interpret fault trees, or test VLSI logic designs before they are constructed. Symbolic simulation uses variables to stand for unknown values.\n\nIn the field of optimization, simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with evolutionary computation to optimize control strategies.\n\nSimulation is extensively used for educational purposes. It is frequently used by way of adaptive hypermedia.\n\nSimulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system. There is a distinction, though, between simulations used for training and Instructional simulation.\n\nTraining simulations typically come in one of three categories:\n\nIn standardized tests, \"live\" simulations are sometimes called \"high-fidelity\", producing \"samples of likely performance\", as opposed to \"low-fidelity\", \"pencil-and-paper\" simulations producing only \"signs of possible performance\", but the distinction between high, moderate and low fidelity remains relative, depending on the context of a particular comparison.\n\nSimulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real-world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. Seymour Papert was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the Logo programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most famous microworlds. As another example, the Global Challenge Award online STEM learning web site uses microworld simulations to teach science concepts related to global warming and the future of energy. Other projects for simulations in educations are Open Source Physics, NetSim etc.\n\nProject Management Simulation is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for project management training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.\n\n\"Social simulations\" may be used in social science classrooms to illustrate social and political processes in anthropology, economics, history, political science, or sociology courses, typically at the high school or university level. These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events. An example of the latter would be Barnard College's \"Reacting to the Past\" series of historical educational games. The National Science Foundation has also supported the creation of reacting games that address science and math education. In Social media simulations, participants train communication with critics and other stakeholders in a private environment. This is also called a Social media stresstest.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing use of social simulations for staff training in aid and development agencies. The Carana simulation, for example, was first developed by the United Nations Development Programme, and is now used in a very revised form by the World Bank for training staff to deal with fragile and conflict-affected countries.\n\nMilitary uses for simulation often involve aircraft or armoured fighting vehicles, but can also target small arms and other weapon systems training. Specifically, virtual firearms ranges have become the norm in most military training processes and there is a significant amount of data to suggest this is a useful tool for armed professionals.\n\nVirtual simulations represent a specific category of simulation that utilizes simulation equipment to create a simulated world for the user. Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) . Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of immersion for the user.\n\nThere is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\nBody tracking: The motion capture method is often used to record the user's movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.\nPhysical controllers: Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.\nVoice/sound recognition: This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.\n\nResearch in future input systems holds a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller proved that naïve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.\n\nThere is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver a stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\nVisual display: Visual displays provide the visual stimulus to the user.\nAural display: Several different types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds spatially. Special software can be used to produce 3D audio effects 3D audio to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.\n\nHaptic display: These displays provide a sense of touch to the user (haptic technology). This type of output is sometimes referred to as force feedback.\nVestibular display: These displays provide a sense of motion to the user (motion simulator). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move in such a way as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).\n\nMedical simulators are increasingly being developed and deployed to teach therapeutic and diagnostic procedures as well as medical concepts and decision making to personnel in the health professions. Simulators have been developed for training procedures ranging from the basics such as blood draw, to laparoscopic surgery and trauma care. They are also important to help on prototyping new devices for biomedical engineering problems. Currently, simulators are applied to research and develop tools for new therapies, treatments and early diagnosis in medicine.\n\nMany medical simulators involve a computer connected to a plastic simulation of the relevant\nanatomy. Sophisticated simulators of this type employ a life-size mannequin that responds to injected drugs and can be programmed to create simulations of life-threatening emergencies.\nIn other simulations, visual components of the procedure are reproduced by computer graphics techniques, while touch-based components are reproduced by haptic feedback devices combined with physical simulation routines computed in response to the user's actions. Medical simulations of this sort will often use 3D CT or MRI scans of patient data to enhance realism. Some medical simulations are developed to be widely distributed (such as web-enabled simulations and procedural simulations that can be viewed via standard web browsers) and can be interacted with using standard computer interfaces, such as the keyboard and mouse.\n\nAnother important medical application of a simulator—although, perhaps, denoting a slightly different meaning of \"simulator\"—is the use of a placebo drug, a formulation that simulates the active drug in trials of drug efficacy (see Placebo (origins of technical term)).\n\nPatient safety is a concern in the medical industry. Patients have been known to suffer injuries and even death due to management error, and lack of using best standards of care and training. According to Building a National Agenda for Simulation-Based Medical Education (Eder-Van Hook, Jackie, 2004), \"a health care provider's ability to react prudently in an unexpected situation is one of the most critical factors in creating a positive outcome in medical emergency, regardless of whether it occurs on the battlefield, freeway, or hospital emergency room.\" Eder-Van Hook (2004) also noted that medical errors kill up to 98,000 with an estimated cost between $37 and $50 million and $17 to $29 billion for preventable adverse events dollars per year.\n\nSimulation is being used to study patient safety, as well as train medical professionals. Studying patient safety and safety interventions in healthcare is challenging, because there is a lack of experimental control (i.e., patient complexity, system/process variances) to see if an intervention made a meaningful difference (Groves & Manges, 2017). An example of innovative simulation to study patient safety is from nursing research. Groves et al. (2016) used a high-fidelity simulation to examine nursing safety-oriented behaviors during times such as change-of-shift report.\n\nHowever, the value of simulation interventions to translating to clinical practice are is still debatable. As Nishisaki states, \"there is good evidence that simulation training improves provider and team self-efficacy and competence on manikins. There is also good evidence that procedural simulation improves actual operational performance in clinical settings.\" However, there is a need to have improved evidence to show that crew resource management training through simulation. One of the largest challenges is showing that team simulation improves team operational performance at the bedside. Although evidence that simulation-based training actually improves patient outcome has been slow to accrue, today the ability of simulation to provide hands-on experience that translates to the operating room is no longer in doubt.\n\nOne of the largest factors that might impact the ability to have training impact the work of practitioners at the bedside is the ability to empower frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015). Another example of an attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training is patient care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place. This training consists of 20 minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift. One study found that just in time training improved the transition to the bedside. The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does in fact increase patient safety.\n\nThe first medical simulators were simple models of human patients.\n\nSince antiquity, these representations in clay and stone were used to demonstrate clinical features of disease states and their effects on humans. Models have been found in many cultures and continents. These models have been used in some cultures (e.g., Chinese culture) as a \"diagnostic\" instrument, allowing women to consult male physicians while maintaining social laws of modesty. Models are used today to help students learn the anatomy of the musculoskeletal system and organ systems.\n\nIn 2002, the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) was formed to become a leader in international interprofessional advances the application of medical simulation in healthcare\n\nThe need for a \"uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession\" was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research. In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need.\n\nActive models that attempt to reproduce living anatomy or physiology are recent developments. The famous \"Harvey\" mannequin was developed at the University of Miami and is able to recreate many of the physical findings of the cardiology examination, including palpation, auscultation, and electrocardiography.\n\nMore recently, interactive models have been developed that respond to actions taken by a student or physician. Until recently, these simulations were two dimensional computer programs that acted more like a textbook than a patient. Computer simulations have the advantage of allowing a student to make judgments, and also to make errors. The process of iterative learning through assessment, evaluation, decision making, and error correction creates a much stronger learning environment than passive instruction.\n\nSimulators have been proposed as an ideal tool for assessment of students for clinical skills. For patients, \"cybertherapy\" can be used for sessions simulating traumatic experiences, from fear of heights to social anxiety.\n\nProgrammed patients and simulated clinical situations, including mock disaster drills, have been used extensively for education and evaluation. These \"lifelike\" simulations are expensive, and lack reproducibility. A fully functional \"3Di\" simulator would be the most specific tool available for teaching and measurement of clinical skills. Gaming platforms have been applied to create these virtual medical environments to create an interactive method for learning and application of information in a clinical context.\n\nImmersive disease state simulations allow a doctor or HCP to experience what a disease actually feels like. Using sensors and transducers symptomatic effects can be delivered to a participant allowing them to experience the patients disease state.\n\nSuch a simulator meets the goals of an objective and standardized examination for clinical competence. This system is superior to examinations that use \"standard patients\" because it permits the quantitative measurement of competence, as well as reproducing the same objective findings.\n\nSimulation in entertainment encompasses many large and popular industries such as film, television, video games (including serious games) and rides in theme parks. Although modern simulation is thought to have its roots in training and the military, in the 20th century it also became a conduit for enterprises which were more hedonistic in nature.\n\nThe first simulation game may have been created as early as 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. This was a straightforward game that simulated a missile being fired at a target. The curve of the missile and its speed could be adjusted using several knobs. In 1958, a computer game called \"\"Tennis for Two\"\" was created by Willy Higginbotham which simulated a tennis game between two players who could both play at the same time using hand controls and was displayed on an oscilloscope. This was one of the first electronic video games to use a graphical display.\n\nComputer-generated imagery was used in the film to simulate objects as early as 1972 in the A Computer Animated Hand, parts of which were shown on the big screen in the 1976 film Futureworld. Many will remember the \"\"targeting computer\"\" that young Skywalker turns off in the 1977 film \"Star Wars\".\n\nThe film \"Tron\" (1982) was the first film to use computer-generated imagery for more than a couple of minutes.\n\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s caused 3D simulation to become more widely used and it began to appear in movies and in computer-based games such as Atari's \"Battlezone\" (1980) and Acornsoft's \"Elite\" (1984), one of the first wire-frame 3D graphics games for home computers.\n\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s made the computer more affordable and more capable than they were in previous decades, which facilitated the rise of computer such as the Xbox gaming. The first video game consoles released in the 1970s and early 1980s fell prey to the industry crash in 1983, but in 1985, Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) which became one of the best selling consoles in video game history. In the 1990s, computer games became widely popular with the release of such game as \"The Sims\" and \"Command & Conquer\" and the still increasing power of desktop computers. Today, computer simulation games such as \"World of Warcraft\" are played by millions of people around the world.\n\nIn 1993, the film \"Jurassic Park\" became the first popular film to use computer-generated graphics extensively, integrating the simulated dinosaurs almost seamlessly into live action scenes.\n\nThis event transformed the film industry; in 1995, the film \"Toy Story\" was the first film to use only computer-generated images and by the new millennium computer generated graphics were the leading choice for special effects in films.\n\nThe advent of virtual cinematography in the early 2000s (decade) has led to an explosion of movies that would have been impossible to shoot without it. Classic examples are the digital look-alikes of Neo, Smith and other characters in the Matrix sequels and the extensive use of physically impossible camera runs in The Lord of the Rings (film series) trilogy.\n\nThe terminal in the Pan Am (TV series) no longer existed during the filming of this 2011–2012 aired series, which was no problem as they created it in virtual cinematography utilizing automated viewpoint finding and matching in conjunction with compositing real and simulated footage, which has been the bread and butter of the movie artist in and around film studios since the early 2000s.\n\nComputer-generated imagery is \"the application of the field of 3D computer graphics to special effects\". This technology is used for visual effects because they are high in quality, controllable, and can create effects that would not be feasible using any other technology either because of cost, resources or safety. Computer-generated graphics can be seen in many live-action movies today, especially those of the action genre. Further, computer-generated imagery has almost completely supplanted hand-drawn animation in children's movies which are increasingly computer-generated only. Examples of movies that use computer-generated imagery include \"Finding Nemo\", \"300\" and \"Iron Man\".\n\nSimulation games, as opposed to other genres of video and computer games, represent or simulate an environment accurately. Moreover, they represent the interactions between the playable characters and the environment realistically. These kinds of games are usually more complex in terms of gameplay. Simulation games have become incredibly popular among people of all ages. Popular simulation games include \"SimCity\" and \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\". There are also flight simulator and driving simulator games.\n\nSimulators have been used for entertainment since the Link Trainer in the 1930s. The first modern simulator ride to open at a theme park was Disney's Star Tours in 1987 soon followed by Universal's The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera in 1990 which was the first ride to be done entirely with computer graphics.\n\nSimulator rides are the progeny of military training simulators and commercial simulators, but they are different in a fundamental way. While military training simulators react realistically to the input of the trainee in real time, ride simulators only feel like they move realistically and move according to prerecorded motion scripts. One of the first simulator rides, Star Tours, which cost $32 million, used a hydraulic motion based cabin. The movement was programmed by a joystick. Today's simulator rides, such as The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man include elements to increase the amount of immersion experienced by the riders such as: 3D imagery, physical effects (spraying water or producing scents), and movement through an environment. Examples of simulation rides include\nMission Space and The Simpsons Ride. There are many simulation rides at theme parks like Disney, Universal etc., Examples are Flint Stones, Earth Quake, Time Machine, King Kong.\n\nManufacturing represents one of the most important applications of simulation. This technique represents a valuable tool used by engineers when evaluating the effect of capital investment in equipment and physical facilities like factory plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Simulation can be used to predict the performance of an existing or planned system and to compare alternative solutions for a particular design problem.\n\nAnother important goal of Simulation in Manufacturing Systems is to quantify system performance. Common measures of system performance include the following:\n\nmiAn automobile simulator provides an opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to feel as if they are sitting in the cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.\n\nThe simulator provides a constructive experience for the novice driver and enables more complex exercises to be undertaken by the more mature driver. For novice drivers, truck simulators provide an opportunity to begin their career by applying best practice. For mature drivers, simulation provides the ability to enhance good driving or to detect poor practice and to suggest the necessary steps for remedial action. For companies, it provides an opportunity to educate staff in the driving skills that achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of their actions in all possible situations.\n\nAn open-source simulation platform for creating dynamic mechanical models built from combinations of rigid and deformable bodies, joints, constraints, and various force actuators. It is specialized for creating biomechanical models of human anatomical structures, with the intention to study their function and eventually assist in the design and planning of medical treatment.\n\nA biomechanics simulator is used to analyze walking dynamics, study sports performance, simulate surgical procedures, analyze joint loads, design medical devices, and animate human and animal movement.\n\nA neuromechanical simulator that combines biomechanical and biologically realistic neural network simulation. It allows the user to test hypotheses on the neural basis of behavior in a physically accurate 3-D virtual environment.\n\nA city simulator can be a city-building game but can also be a tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. AnyLogic is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally agent-based simulations with explicit representations for land use and transportation. UrbanSim and LEAM are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and transportation planning.\n\nThe \"classroom of the future\" will probably contain several kinds of simulators, in addition to textual and visual learning tools. This will allow students to enter the clinical years better prepared, and with a higher skill level. The advanced student or postgraduate will have a more concise and comprehensive method of retraining—or of incorporating new clinical procedures into their skill set—and regulatory bodies and medical institutions will find it easier to assess the proficiency and competency of individuals.\n\nThe classroom of the future will also form the basis of a clinical skills unit for continuing education of medical personnel; and in the same way that the use of periodic flight training assists airline pilots, this technology will assist practitioners throughout their career.\n\nThe simulator will be more than a \"living\" textbook, it will become an integral a part of the practice of medicine. The simulator environment will also provide a standard platform for curriculum development in institutions of medical education.\n\nModern satellite communications systems (SatCom) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, the need for broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically in the past few years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, satcom system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real-world operating conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SatCom system designer or planner to simulate real-world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations, they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\n\nSimulation solutions are being increasingly integrated with CAx (CAD, CAM, CAE...) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, especially at the earlier concept and design stages, has the potential of providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.\n\nThe research firm Aberdeen Group has found that nearly all best-in-class manufacturers use simulation early in the design process as compared to 3 or 4 laggards who do not.\n\nThe successful use of simulation, early in the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire CAD, CAM and PLM solution-set. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a multi-CAD environment, and include solutions for managing simulation data and processes and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as tailorable user interfaces and \"wizards\" which allow all appropriate PLM participants to take part in the simulation process.\n\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters. Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a lifelike experience. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle terrorism attacks, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\n\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education). CADE has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.\" Developed by a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\" Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\n\nAt the University of Québec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air – LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\n\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment—this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\n\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment. They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\n\nIn economics and especially macroeconomics, the effects of proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, open market operations, etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\n\nSimulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes. For example, in electrical engineering, delay lines may be used to simulate propagation delay and phase shift caused by an actual transmission line. Similarly, dummy loads may be used to simulate impedance without simulating propagation and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted. A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. \"Contrast with\": emulate.\n\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer-assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. In these cases the physical models require dynamic similitude. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in chemical engineering, for example, process simulations are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to the power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. Mimic is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\n\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.\n\nThe software tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.\n\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some ergonomics simulation software permits interactive, real-time simulation and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for ergonomics requires expensive equipment and the creation of props to represent the environment or product.\n\nSome applications of ergonomic simulation in include analysis of solid waste collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming, automotive assembly line, virtual prototyping of rehabilitation aids, and aerospace product design. Ford engineers use ergonomics simulation software to perform virtual product design reviews. Using engineering data, the simulations assist evaluation of assembly ergonomics. The company uses Siemen's Jack and Jill ergonomics simulation software in improving worker safety and efficiency, without the need to build expensive prototypes.\n\nIn finance, computer simulations are often used for scenario planning. Risk-adjusted net present value, for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs. By imitating the performance of the project under evaluation, simulation can provide a distribution of NPV over a range of discount rates and other variables. Simulations are also often used to test a financial theory or the ability of a financial model.\n\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on stochastic asset models. Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life. As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\n\nFlight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD) are used to train pilots on the ground. In comparison to training in an actual aircraft, simulation-based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground. For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\n\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft. For example, conducting multiple instrument approaches in the actual aircraft may require significant time spent repositioning the aircraft, while in a simulation, as soon as one approach has been completed, the instructor can immediately preposition the simulated aircraft to an ideal (or less than ideal) location from which to begin the next approach.\n\nFlight simulation also provides an economic advantage over training in an actual aircraft. Once fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs are taken into account, the operating costs of an FSTD are usually substantially lower than the operating costs of the simulated aircraft. For some large transport category airplanes, the operating costs may be several times lower for the FSTD than the actual aircraft.\n\nSome people who use simulator software, especially flight simulator software, build their own simulator at home. Some people—to further the realism of their homemade simulator—buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine. While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software—and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks—many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about a realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of written-off aircraft, at aircraft boneyards. This permits people to simulate a hobby that they are unable to pursue in real life.\n\nBearing resemblance to flight simulators, marine simulators train ships' personnel. The most common marine simulators include:\n\nSimulators like these are mostly used within maritime colleges, training institutions, and navies. They often consist of a replication of a ships' bridge, with the operating console(s), and a number of screens on which the virtual surroundings are projected.\n\nMilitary simulations, also known informally as war games, are models in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities. They exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, their scope has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors (for example, the NationLab series of strategic exercises in Latin America). While many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about the model's specifics outside professional circles.\n\nSimulation techniques have also been applied to payment and securities settlement systems. Among the main users are central banks who are generally responsible for the oversight of market infrastructure and entitled to contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment systems.\n\nCentral banks have been using payment system simulations to evaluate things such as the adequacy or sufficiency of liquidity available ( in the form of account balances and intraday credit limits) to participants (mainly banks) to allow efficient settlement of payments. The need for liquidity is also dependent on the availability and the type of netting procedures in the systems, thus some of the studies have a focus on system comparisons.\n\nAnother application is to evaluate risks related to events such as communication network breakdowns or the inability of participants to send payments (e.g. in case of possible bank failure). This kind of analysis falls under the concepts of stress testing or scenario analysis.\n\nA common way to conduct these simulations is to replicate the settlement logics of the real payment or securities settlement systems under analysis and then use real observed payment data. In case of system comparison or system development, naturally, also the other settlement logics need to be implemented.\n\nTo perform stress testing and scenario analysis, the observed data needs to be altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of liquidity, initial liquidity levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.\n\nAn inference is usually done by comparing the benchmark simulation results to the results of altered simulation setups by comparing indicators such as unsettled transactions or settlement delays.\n\nProject management simulation is simulation used for project management training and analysis. It is often used as a training simulation for project managers. In other cases, it is used for what-if analysis and for supporting decision-making in real projects. Frequently the simulation is conducted using software tools.\n\nA robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a specific (or not) robot without being dependent on the 'real' robot. In some cases, these applications can be transferred to the real robot (or rebuilt) without modifications. Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be 'created' in the real world because of cost, time, or the 'uniqueness' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature physics engines to simulate a robot's dynamics.\n\nSimulation of production systems is used mainly to examine the effect of improvements or investments in a production system. Most often this is done using a static spreadsheet with process times and transportation times. For more sophisticated simulations Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is used with the advantages to simulate dynamics in the production system. A production system is very much dynamic depending on variations in manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-ups, breaks, breakdowns and small stoppages. There are lots of software commonly used for discrete event simulation. They differ in usability and markets but do often share the same foundation.\n\nSimulations are useful in modeling the flow of transactions through business processes, such as in the field of sales process engineering, to study and improve the flow of customer orders through various stages of completion (say, from an initial proposal for providing goods/services through order acceptance and installation). Such simulations can help predict the impact of how improvements in methods might impact variability, cost, labor time, and the number of transactions at various stages in the process. A full-featured computerized process simulator can be used to depict such models, as can simpler educational demonstrations using spreadsheet software, pennies being transferred between cups based on the roll of a die, or dipping into a tub of colored beads with a scoop.\n\nIn sports, computer simulations are often done to predict the outcome of events and the performance of individual sportspeople. They attempt to recreate the event through models built from statistics. The increase in technology has allowed anyone with knowledge of programming the ability to run simulations of their models. The simulations are built from a series of mathematical algorithms, or models, and can vary with accuracy. Accuscore, which is licensed by companies such as ESPN, is a well-known simulation program for all major sports. It offers a detailed analysis of games through simulated betting lines, projected point totals and overall probabilities.\n\nWith the increased interest in fantasy sports simulation models that predict individual player performance have gained popularity. Companies like What If Sports and StatFox specialize in not only using their simulations for predicting game results but how well individual players will do as well. Many people use models to determine who to start in their fantasy leagues.\n\nAnother way simulations are helping the sports field is in the use of biomechanics. Models are derived and simulations are run from data received from sensors attached to athletes and video equipment. Sports biomechanics aided by simulation models answer questions regarding training techniques such as the effect of fatigue on throwing performance (height of throw) and biomechanical factors of the upper limbs (reactive strength index; hand contact time).\n\nComputer simulations allow their users to take models which before were too complex to run, and give them answers. Simulations have proven to be some of the best insights into both play performance and team predictability.\n\nSimulation is used at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to train and certify Space Shuttle engineers during simulated launch countdown operations. The Space Shuttle engineering community participates in a launch countdown integrated simulation before each shuttle flight. This simulation is a virtual simulation where real people interact with simulated Space Shuttle vehicle and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) hardware. The Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, also known as S0044, involves countdown processes that integrate many of the Space Shuttle vehicle and GSE systems. Some of the Shuttle systems integrated in the simulation are the main propulsion system, main engines, solid rocket boosters, ground liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, external tank, flight controls, navigation, and avionics. The high-level objectives of the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation are:\n\nThe Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation takes place at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Control Center Firing Rooms. The firing room used during the simulation is the same control room where real launch countdown operations are executed. As a result, equipment used for real launch countdown operations is engaged. Command and control computers, application software, engineering plotting and trending tools, launch countdown procedure documents, launch commit criteria documents, hardware requirement documents, and any other items used by the engineering launch countdown teams during real launch countdown operations are used during the simulation.\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle hardware and related GSE hardware is simulated by mathematical models (written in Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) modeling language ) that behave and react like real hardware. During the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, engineers command and control hardware via real application software executing in the control consoles – just as if they were commanding real vehicle hardware. However, these real software applications do not interface with real Shuttle hardware during simulations. Instead, the applications interface with mathematical model representations of the vehicle and GSE hardware. Consequently, the simulations bypass sensitive and even dangerous mechanisms while providing engineering measurements detailing how the hardware would have reacted. Since these math models interact with the command and control application software, models and simulations are also used to debug and verify the functionality of application software.\n\nThe only true way to test GNSS receivers (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may, for example, be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without the need to take it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new Galileo (satellite navigation) there is no alternative, as the real signals do not yet exist.\n\nPredicting weather conditions by extrapolating/interpolating previous data is one of the real use of simulation. Most of the weather forecasts use this information published by Weather buereaus. This kind of simulations helps in predicting and forewarning about extreme weather conditions like the path of an active hurricane/cyclone.\nNumerical weather prediction for forecasting involves complicated numeric computer models to predict weather accurately by taking many parameters into account.\n\nStrategy games—both traditional and modern—may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see History of Go for an example of such a tradition, or Kriegsspiel for a more recent example).\n\nMany other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from business, to government, to construction, to piloting vehicles (see above).\n\nHistorically, the word had negative connotations:\n\nHowever, the connection between simulation and dissembling later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.\n\n"}

{"id": "44831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44831", "title": "Mortadella", "text": "Mortadella\n\nMortadella () is a large Italian sausage or luncheon meat (\"salume\" ) made of finely hashed or ground, heat-cured pork, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat (principally the hard fat from the neck of the pig). Mortadella is a product of Bologna, Italy. It is flavoured with spices, including whole or ground black pepper, myrtle berries, and pistachios.\n\nTraditionally, the pork filling was ground to a paste using a large mortar (\"mortaio\" ) and pestle. Two Roman funerary steles in the archaeological museum of Bologna show such mortars. Alternatively, according to Cortelazzo and Zolli \"Dizionario Etimologico della Lingua Italiana\" 1979-88, mortadella derives its name from a Roman sausage flavoured with myrtle in place of pepper.\n\nThe Romans called the sausage \"farcimen mirtatum\" (myrtle sausage), because the sausage was flavoured with myrtle berries, a popular spice before pepper became available to European markets. Anna Del Conte (\"The Gastronomy of Italy\" 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.\n\nMortadella originated in Bologna, the capital of Emilia-Romagna; elsewhere in Italy it may be made either in the Bolognese manner or in a distinctively local style. The mortadella of Prato is a Tuscan speciality flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with alchermes. The mortadella of Amatrice, high in the Apennines of northern Lazio, is unusual in being lightly smoked. Because it originated in Bologna, this contributed to the naming of the American sausage meat \"bologna\".\n\nMortadella Bologna has Protected Geographical Indication status under European Union law. The zone of production is extensive: as well as Emilia-Romagna and the neighbouring regions of Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Marche and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and Trentino.\n\nMortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with pepper and olives is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as \"mortadela italiana\" (Italian mortadella), to differentiate it from a local variant named \"catalana\".\n\nMortadella is also very popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries it is spelled \"mortadela\", and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains.\n\nIn Brazil, São Paulo has a very popular \"mortadela\" sandwich sold in the Mercado Municipal.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, \"smoked mortadella\" is sometimes confused with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados, and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.\n\nIn Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as \"pariser\" or \"parizer\". It is a type of artisan bologna.\nIn Hungary, a similar product is called, in Hungarian, \"mortadella\" and a plain variety called \"pariser\", \"parizer\" or \"párizsi\". The term \"parizer\" is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while \"parizier\" is used in Albania, Kosovo and other territories of the Balkans. The classic Italian \"mortadella\" is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast. \n\nIn Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called Parizaki or Mortadelaki, and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Macedonia, the product known as \"mortadela\" is widely eaten. \n\nIn Poland, \"mortadela\" slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional pork chops.\n\nIn several countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, halal or kosher mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef, or turkey. The Palestinian Siniora brand is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or pepper. Lebanese Al-Taghziah is a famous brand that is sold around the world. The most popular brands in the GCC are Americana Group and Halwani Brothers.\nIt is also popular in Iran, albeit usually made with beef or lamb, and called commonly \"kaalbas\", from Russian \"kolbasa\".\n\nPork mortadella is sold in Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the UAE.\n\nA similar commercial sausage product that omits the cubes of pork fat, called bologna, is popular in the United States. A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called olive loaf.\n\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy. This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film \"La mortadella\" starring Sophia Loren. The title for the United States release was \"Lady Liberty\".\n\nThe ban in the United States was lifted due to the Veterinary Equivalency Agreement that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union.\n\nIn Russia, a very similar product is called \"doctor's sausage\" (). However, this product is normally made from a beef and pork mixture, and does not include pieces of fat (sausages with pieces of fat are called \"Lubitelskaya\" and \"Stolichnaya\") or myrtle as a primary spice, being instead flavoured with just coriander and nutmeg. It also traditionally contains eggs and milk, usually absent in traditional mortadella.\n\n\"Chả lụa\" or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish \"bánh cuốn\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44984", "title": "Kapellmeister", "text": "Kapellmeister\n\nIn German-speaking countries during the approximate period 1500–1800, the word Kapellmeister often designated the director of music for a monarch or nobleman. For English speakers, it is this sense of the term that is most often encountered, since it appears frequently in biographical writing about composers who worked in German-speaking countries.\n\nA Kapellmeister position was a senior one and involved supervision of other musicians. Johann Sebastian Bach worked from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen. Joseph Haydn worked for many years as Kapellmeister for the Esterházy family, a high-ranking noble family of the Austrian Empire. George Frideric Handel served as Kapellmeister for George, Elector of Hanover (who eventually became George I of Great Britain).\n\nA Kapellmeister might also be the director of music for a church. Thus, Georg Reutter was the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, where his young choristers included both Joseph and Michael Haydn.\n\nBecoming a Kapellmeister was a mark of success for professional musicians of this time. For instance, Joseph Haydn once remarked that he was glad his father (a wheelwright) had lived long enough to see his son become a Kapellmeister. The term also implied the possession of considerable musical skill. When the 18th century actor and musician Joachim Daniel Preisler heard the famous soprano Aloysia Weber (Mozart's sister-in-law) perform in her home, he paid her the following compliment in his diary:\n\nThe well-known \"Mozardt\" is her brother-in-law, and has taught her so well that she accompanies from a score and plays interludes like a Kapellmeister.\nBy the end of the 18th century, many of the nobility had declined in their economic power relative to the newly prosperous middle class. Eventually, the maintenance of a \" became too expensive for most nobles, which led to a decline in the number of Kapellmeister positions. A well-known instance occurred in 1790, when Prince Anton Esterházy succeeded his father Nikolaus and dismissed almost all of the latter's extensive musical establishment. But as Jones (2009) points out, Prince Anton was hardly alone in doing this; during this same period, \"the steady decline in the number of orchestras supported by aristocratic families represented a ... change that affected all composers and their works.\" This was a difficult time for musicians, who needed to find new ways to support themselves. For instance, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) never worked as a Kapellmeister, but was supported by a somewhat unreliable combination of noble patronage, publication, and concert income.\n\nMozart never was a Kapellmeister in the sense given above. In 1787, he was given a paid position in the court of the Austrian Emperor, as \" (\"chamber composer\"), but authority in matters musical at the court was exercised primarily by Antonio Salieri. However, in reviews, diaries, and advertising, Mozart was commonly referred to as \"\". It seems that Mozart's prestige, along with the fact that he frequently appeared in public directing other musicians, led to the use of \"Kapellmeister\" as a term of respect.\n\nIn April 1791, Mozart did apply to become the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, and was in fact designated by the City Council to take over this job following the death of the then-ailing incumbent, Leopold Hofmann. However, this never took place, since Mozart died (December 1791) before Hofmann did (1793).\n\nVariant spellings \"capellmeister\" and \"capelle\", to refer to the orchestra or choir, are sometimes encountered in English language works about composers who held the title.\n\nThe word ' specified that the Kapellmeister worked at a nobleman's court ('); a \"\" held a somewhat less senior position.\n\nEquivalent positions existed in other European countries and were referred to with equivalent names, as follows: , , , , , , , , , and . In Finnish \"kapellimestari\" is still the primary word used of conductors.\n\n\nIn contemporary German, the term \"Kapellmeister\" has become less common in favor of the term ' (\"conductor\"). When used today, however, it designates the director or chief conductor of an orchestra or choir. It suggests involvement in orchestra or choir policy (for example, selecting repertoire, concert schedules, choosing guest conductors and so on) as well as conducting. In military settings it refers to a bandmaster. The music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra traditionally holds the old-fashioned title '. In other German opera houses, the term generally refers to a deputy conductor reporting to the ' (\"General Music Director\", usually also the chief conductor). An opera company may have several Kapellmeisters, ranked as ' (\"First...\"), \"\" (\"Second...\"), etc.\n\nThe conductor Christian Thielemann has offered a nuanced account of the \"Dirigent\"/\"Kapellmeister\" distinction in contemporary usage. He suggests that \"Kapellmeister\" has unfairly acquired a sense of routine, or failure to project glamor: \"a Kapellmeister now describes a pale, meek figure beating time. A policeman on duty at the podium directing the musical traffic, no more.\" In fact, Thielemann, who is fully aware of the historical usage of the term, would himself prefer to be called a \"Kapellmeister\": \"it implies such virtues as knowledge of a work, great ability, and dedication to the cause of music\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45387", "title": "Polish literature", "text": "Polish literature\n\nPolish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German and Esperanto. According to Czesław Miłosz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold, but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe); but also, Poland's own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period.\n\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century. One of the leading Polish Enlightenment authors included Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801) and Jan Potocki (1761–1815). Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation. Early Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics. Notable writers included Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period, many Polish Romantics worked abroad. Influential poets included Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński.\n\nIn the aftermath of the failed January Uprising, the new period of Polish Positivism began to advocate skepticism and the exercise of reason. The modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). Notable authors included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The neo-Romantic era was exemplified by the works of Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont, Gabriela Zapolska, and Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Literature of the Second Polish Republic (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. New avant-garde writers included Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska.\n\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. Out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature. \nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski. Poland had three Nobel Prize winning authors in the later 20th century: Isaac Bashevis Singer (1978), Czesław Miłosz (1980) and Wisława Szymborska (1996).\n\nAlmost nothing remains of Polish literature prior to the country's Christianization in 966. Poland's pagan inhabitants certainly possessed an oral literature extending to Slavic songs, legends and beliefs, but early Christian writers did not deem it worthy of mention in the obligatory Latin, and so it has perished.\n\nWithin the Polish literary tradition, it is customary to include works that have dealt with Poland, even if not written by ethnic Poles. This is the case with Gallus Anonymus, the first historian to have described Poland in his work entitled \"Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\" (Deeds of the Princes of the Poles), composed in sophisticated Latin. Gallus was a foreign monk who accompanied King Bolesław III Wrymouth in his return from Hungary to Poland. The important tradition of Polish historiography was continued by Wincenty Kadłubek, a thirteenth-century Bishop of Kraków, as well as Jan Długosz, a Polish priest and secretary to Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki.\n\nThe first recorded sentence in the Polish language reads: \"\"Day ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\"\" (\"Let me grind, and you take a rest\") — a paraphrase of the Latin \"\"Sine, ut ego etiam molam.\"\" The work, in which this phrase appeared, reflects the culture of early Poland. The sentence was written within the Latin language chronicle \"Liber fundationis\" from between 1269 and 1273, a history of the Cistercian monastery in Henryków, Silesia. It was recorded by an abbot known simply as Piotr (Peter), referring to an event almost a hundred years earlier. The sentence was supposedly uttered by a Bohemian settler, Bogwal (\"Bogwalus Boemus\"), a subject of Bolesław the Tall, expressing compassion for his own wife who \"very often stood grinding by the quern-stone.\" Most notable early medieval Polish works in Latin and the Old Polish language include the oldest extant manuscript of fine prose in the Polish language entitled the \"Holy Cross Sermons\", as well as the earliest Polish-language \"Bible of Queen Zofia\" and the \"Chronicle of Janko of Czarnków\" from the 14th century, not to mention the \"Puławy Psalter\".\n\nMost early texts in Polish vernacular were influenced heavily by the Latin sacred literature. They include \"Bogurodzica\" (Mother of God), a hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary written down in the 15th century, though popular at least a century earlier. \"Bogurodzica\" served as a national anthem. It was one of the first texts reproduced in Polish on a printing press; and so was the \"Master Polikarp's Conversation with Death\" (Rozmowa mistrza Polikarpa ze śmiercią).\n\nIn the early 1470s, one of the first printing houses in Poland was set up by Kasper Straube in Kraków (see: spread of the printing press). In 1475 Kasper Elyan of Glogau (Głogów) set up a printing shop in Breslau (Wrocław), Silesia. Twenty years later, the first Cyrillic printing house was founded at Kraków by Schweipolt Fiol for Eastern Orthodox Church hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include \"Saint Florian's Breviary,\" printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; \"Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia\" (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as Jan Długosz's \"Chronicle\" from the 15th century and his \"Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium\".\n\nWith the advent of the Renaissance, the Polish language was finally accepted on an equal footing with Latin. Polish culture and art flourished under Jagiellonian rule, and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing with them new literary trends. Such writers included Kallimach (Filippo Buonaccorsi) and Conrad Celtis. Many Polish writers studied abroad, and at the Kraków Academy, which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents. In 1488, the world's first literary society, the \"Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana\" (Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Kraków. Notable members included Conrad Celtes, Albert Brudzewski, Filip Callimachus and Laurentius Corvinus.\n\nA Polish writer who used Latin as his principal vehicle of expression was Klemens Janicki (\"Ianicius\"), who became one of the most notable Latin poets of his time and was laureled by the Pope. Other writers such as Mikołaj Rej, and Jan Kochanowski, laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the Polish language appeared in this period - It was a prayer-book by Biernat of Lublin (ca. 1465 – after 1529) called \"Raj duszny\" (\"Hortulus Animae\", Eden of the Soul), printed in Kraków in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by Florian Ungler (originally from Bavaria). The most notable Polish writers and poets active in the 16th century include:\nThe literature in the period of Polish Baroque (between 1620 and 1764) was significantly influenced by the great popularization of Jesuit high schools, which offered education based on Latin classics as part of a preparation for a political career. The studies of poetry required the practical knowledge of writing both Latin and Polish poems, which radically increased the number of poets and versifiers countrywide. On the soil of humanistic education some exceptional writers grew as well: Piotr Kochanowski (1566–1620) gave his translation of Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\"; Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, a poet laureate, became known among European nations as \"Horatius christianus \" (Christian Horace) for his Latin writings; Jan Andrzej Morsztyn (1621–1693), an epicurean courtier and diplomat, extolled in his sophisticated poems the valors of earthly delights; and Wacław Potocki (1621–1696), the most productive writer of the Polish Baroque, unified the typical opinions of Polish szlachta with some deeper reflections and existential experiences. Notable Polish writers and poets active in this period include:\nThe period of Polish Enlightenment began in the 1730s–40s and peaked in the second half of the 18th century during the reign of Poland's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. It went into sharp decline with the Third and final Partition of Poland (1795), followed by political, cultural and economic destruction of the country, and leading to the Great Emigration of Polish elites. The Enlightenment ended around 1822, and was replaced by Polish Romanticism at home and abroad.\n\nOne of the leading Polish Enlightenment poets was Ignacy Krasicki (1735–1801), known locally as \"the Prince of Poets\" and Poland's La Fontaine, author of the first Polish novel called \"The Adventures of Mr. Nicholas Wisdom\" (Mikołaja Doświadczyńskiego przypadki); he was also a playwright, journalist, encyclopedist and translator from French and Greek. Another prominent writer of the period was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), a Polish nobleman, Egyptologist, linguist, and adventurer, whose travel memoirs made him legendary in his homeland. Outside Poland he is known chiefly for his novel, \"The Manuscript Found in Saragossa,\" which has drawn comparisons to such celebrated works as the \"Decameron\" and \"the Arabian Nights\".\nNotable Polish writers and poets of the Enlightenment period include:\nDue to partitions carried out by the neighboring empires – which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state in 1795 – Polish Romanticism, unlike Romanticism elsewhere in Europe, was largely a movement for independence against the foreign occupation, and expressed the ideals and the traditional way of life of the Polish people. The period of Romanticism in Poland ended with the Tsarist suppression of the January 1863 Uprising, marked by public executions by the Russians and deportations to Siberia.\n\nThe literature of Polish Romanticism falls into two distinct periods, both defined by insurgencies: the first around 1820–1830, ending with the November Uprising of 1830; and the second between 1830–1864, giving birth to Polish Positivism. In the first period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics - Their art featured emotionalism and imagination, folklore, country life, as well as the propagation of the ideals of independence. The most famous writers of the period were: Adam Mickiewicz, Seweryn Goszczyński, Tomasz Zan and Maurycy Mochnacki. In the second period (after the January Uprising), many Polish Romantics worked abroad, often banished from the Polish soil by the occupying power. Their work became dominated by the ideals of freedom and the struggle for regaining their country's lost sovereignty. Elements of mysticism became more prominent. Also in that period, the idea of the \"poeta-wieszcz\" (nation's bard) developed. The \"wieszcz\" functioned as spiritual leader to the suppressed people. The most notable poet among the \"leading bards of Romanticism, so recognized in both periods, was Adam Mickiewicz. Other two national poets were: Juliusz Słowacki and Zygmunt Krasiński. Polish writers and poets of the Romantic period include:\nIn the aftermath of the failed January 1863 Uprising against Russian occupation, the new period of Polish Positivism—which took its name from Auguste Comte's philosophy of Positivism—advocated skepticism and the exercise of reason. Questions addressed by Poland's Positivist writers revolved around \"organic work,\" which included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society, including feminists; the assimilation of Poland's Jewish minority; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against \"Kulturkampf\" Germanization and the displacement of the Polish population by German settlers. The writers worked to educate the public about constructive patriotism, which would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated \"social organism\", regardless of adverse circumstances. Poland's Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the Young Poland movement. Prominent writers and poets of Polish Positivism included:\nThe modernist period known as the Young Poland movement in visual arts, literature and music, came into being around 1890, and concluded with the Poland's return to independence (1918). The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong aesthetic opposition to the ideals of its own predecessor (promoting \"organic work\" in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in decadence, symbolism, conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of art for art's sake. Prominent authors who followed this trend included Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer, Stanisław Przybyszewski and Jan Kasprowicz. The later ideology emerged in conjunction with the socio-political upheavals across Europe such as the 1905 Revolution against Nicholas II of Russia, the Norwegian independence, the Moroccan Crisis and others. It was a continuation of romanticism, often called neo-romanticism. The artists and writers following this idea covered a large variety of topics: from the sense of personal mission of a Pole exemplified by Stefan Żeromski's prose, through condemnation of social inequality in works by Władysław Reymont and Gabriela Zapolska, to criticism of Polish society and Polish revolutionary history by Stanisław Wyspiański. In 1905 Henryk Sienkiewicz received a Nobel Prize in literature for his patriotic Trilogy inspiring a new sense of hope. Writers of this period include:\nLiterature of the Second Polish Republic (1918-1939) encompasses a short, though exceptionally dynamic period in Polish literary consciousness. The socio-political reality has changed radically with Poland's return to independence. In large part, derivative of these changes was the collective and unobstructed development of programs for artists and writers. New avant-garde trends had emerged. The period, spanning just twenty years, was full of notable individualities who saw themselves as exponents of changing European civilization, including Tuwim, Witkacy, Gombrowicz, Miłosz, Dąbrowska and Nałkowska (PAL). They all contributed to a new model of the twentieth-century Polish culture echoing its own language of everyday life.\n\nThe two decades of Interbellum were marked by rapid development in the field of poetry, undivided and undiminished for the first time in over a century. From 1918 to 1939, the gradual and successive introduction of new ideas resulted in the formation of separate and distinct trends. The first decade of Polish interwar poetry was clear, constructive, and optimistic; as opposed to the second decade marked by dark visions of the impending war, internal conflicts within the Polish society, and growing pessimism. The whole period was amazingly rich nevertheless. In 1933 the Polish Academy of Literature (PAL) was founded by a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic (Rada Ministrów RP); as the highest opinion-forming authority in the country; it awarded Gold and the Silver Laurels (Złoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn), the two highest national honors for contributions to literature until invasion of Poland in 1939. One of the most prominent poets of the interwar period was Bolesław Leśmian (member of PAL), whose creative personality developed before 1918, and in large part influenced both Interbellum decades (until his death in 1937). The literary life of his contemporaries revolved mostly around the issues of independence. All Polish poets treated the concept of freedom with extreme seriousness, and many patriotic works had emerged at that time, not to mention a particular variant of a poetic cult of Piłsudski.\n\nIn the years of German and Soviet occupation of Poland, all artistic life was dramatically compromised. Cultural institutions were lost. The environment was chaotic, and the writers scattered: some found themselves in concentration and labor camps (or Nazi-era ghettos), others were deported out of the country; some emigrated (Tuwim, Wierzyński), many more joined the ranks of the Polish underground resistance movement (Baczyński, Borowski, Gajcy). All literary outlets were forced to cease operation. Writers who remained at home began organizing literary life in conspiracy, including lectures, evenings of poetry, and secret meetings in the homes of writers and art facilitators. Polish cities where such meetings were held most frequently were: Warsaw, Kraków and Lwów. Writers participated in setting-up of the underground presses (out of 1,500 clandestine publications in Poland, about 200 were devoted to literature). Many fought in the Polish army in exile or resisted the Holocaust in a civil capacity. The generation of the \"Kolumbs,\" born around 1920, were active during the Warsaw Uprising. Best-known representatives of the war years are:\n\nAll texts published under Soviet rules were strictly censored.\nMuch of Polish literature written during the Occupation of Poland appeared in print only after the conclusion of World War II, including books by Nałkowska, Rudnicki, Borowski and others. The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage Émigrés and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of Stalinism. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including Jerzy Andrzejewski, author of \"Ashes and Diamonds\", describing (accoording to Communist design) Anti-communist resistance in Poland. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by Wajda. The new emerging prose writers such as Stanisław Dygat and Stefan Kisielewski approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective. Kazimierz Wyka coined a term \"borderline novel\" for documentary fiction.\n\nThe situation began to worsen dramatically around 1949–1950 with the introduction of the Stalinist doctrine by minister Sokorski, on behalf of the increasingly violent Communist regime, which engaged in gross violations of human rights. In the years 1944–1956, around 300,000 Polish citizens were arrested, of whom many thousands were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. There were 6,000 death sentences pronounced against political prisoners, the majority of them carried out \"in the majesty of the law\". Fearing for their proper jobs, many writers associated with the Borejsza's publishing empire embraced the Sovietization of Polish culture. In 1953 the ZLP Union, run by Kruczkowski with a slew of prominent signatories, declared full support to persecution of religious leaders by the Ministry of Public Security. Death sentences were not enforced, although Father Fudali died in unexplained circumstances, as had 37 other priest and 54 friars already before 1953. Likewise, writer Kazimierz Moczarski from Armia Krajowa (the Home Army), tortured in jail by Romkowski's subordinates for several years and sentenced to death, was pardoned and released only at the end of this period.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A free good is available in as great a quantity as desired with zero opportunity cost to society.\n\nA good that is made available at zero price is not necessarily a free good. For example, a shop might give away its stock in its promotion, but producing these goods would still have required the use of scarce resources.\n\nExamples of free goods are ideas and works that are reproducible at zero cost, or almost zero cost. For example, if someone invents a new device, many people could copy this invention, with no danger of this \"resource\" running out. Other examples include computer programs and web pages.\n\nEarlier schools of economic thought proposed a third type of free good: resources that are scarce but so abundant in nature that there is enough for everyone to have as much as they want. Examples in textbooks included seawater and air.\n\nIntellectual property laws such as copyrights and patents have the effect of converting some intangible goods to scarce goods. Even though these works are free goods by definition and can be reproduced at minimal cost, the production of these works does require scarce resources, such as skilled labour. Thus these laws are used to give exclusive rights to the creators, in order to encourage resources to be appropriately allocated to these activities.\n\nMany post scarcity futurists theorize that advanced nanotechnology with the ability to turn any kind of material automatically into any other combination of equal mass will make all goods essentially free goods, since all raw materials and manufacturing time will become perfectly interchangeable.\n\n"}
{"id": "45599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45599", "title": "Surgery", "text": "Surgery\n\nSurgery is a medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as a disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas.\n\nThe act of performing surgery may be called a \"surgical procedure\", \"operation\", or simply \"surgery\". In this context, the verb \"operate\" means to perform surgery. The adjective \"surgical\" means pertaining to surgery; e.g. surgical instruments or surgical nurse. The patient or subject on which the surgery is performed can be a person or an animal. A surgeon is a person who practices surgery and a surgeon's assistant is a person who practices surgical assistance. A surgical team is made up of surgeon, surgeon's assistant, anaesthesia provider, circulating nurse and surgical technologist. Surgery usually spans minutes to hours, but it is typically not an ongoing or periodic type of treatment. The term \"surgery\" can also refer to the place where surgery is performed, or, in British English, simply the office of a physician, dentist, or veterinarian.\n\nSurgery is a technology consisting of a physical intervention on tissues.\n\nAs a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a patient's tissues or closure of a previously sustained wound. Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this rubric, such as angioplasty or endoscopy, may be considered surgery if they involve \"common\" surgical procedure or settings, such as use of a sterile environment, anesthesia, antiseptic conditions, typical surgical instruments, and suturing or stapling. All forms of surgery are considered invasive procedures; so-called \"noninvasive surgery\" usually refers to an excision that does not penetrate the structure being excised (e.g. laser ablation of the cornea) or to a radiosurgical procedure (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).\n\nSurgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.\n\n\nInpatient surgery is performed in a hospital, and the patient stays at least one night in the hospital after the surgery. Outpatient surgery occurs in a hospital outpatient department or freestanding ambulatory surgery center, and the patient is discharged the same working day. Office surgery occurs in a physician's office, and the patient is discharged the same working day.\n\nAt a hospital, modern surgery is often performed in an operating theater using surgical instruments, an operating table for the patient, and other equipment. Among United States hospitalizations for nonmaternal and nonneonatal conditions in 2012, more than one-fourth of stays and half of hospital costs involved stays that included operating room (OR) procedures. The environment and procedures used in surgery are governed by the principles of aseptic technique: the strict separation of \"sterile\" (free of microorganisms) things from \"unsterile\" or \"contaminated\" things. All surgical instruments must be sterilized, and an instrument must be replaced or re-sterilized if, it becomes contaminated (i.e. handled in an unsterile manner, or allowed to touch an unsterile surface). Operating room staff must wear sterile attire (scrubs, a scrub cap, a sterile surgical gown, sterile latex or non-latex polymer gloves and a surgical mask), and they must scrub hands and arms with an approved disinfectant agent before each procedure.\n\nPrior to surgery, the patient is given a medical examination, receives certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs a consent form and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol the night before the procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.\n\nSome medical systems have a practice of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination is more likely to result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.\n\nIn the pre-operative holding area, the patient changes out of his or her street clothes and is asked to confirm the details of his or her surgery. A set of vital signs are recorded, a peripheral IV line is placed, and pre-operative medications (antibiotics, sedatives, etc.) are given. When the patient enters the operating room, the skin surface to be operated on, called the operating field, is cleaned and prepared by applying an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine to reduce the possibility of infection. If hair is present at the surgical site, it is clipped off prior to prep application. The patient is assisted by an anesthesiologist or resident to make a specific surgical position, then sterile drapes are used to cover the surgical site or at least a wide area surrounding the operating field; the drapes are clipped to a pair of poles near the head of the bed to form an \"ether screen\", which separates the anesthetist/anesthesiologist's working area (unsterile) from the surgical site (sterile).\n\nAnesthesia is administered to prevent pain from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing. Based on the procedure, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable. With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the patient can remain conscious or minimally sedated. In contrast, general anesthesia renders the patient unconscious and paralyzed during surgery. The patient is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.\nChoice of surgical method and anesthetic technique aims to reduce the risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the surgical stress response.\n\nAn incision is made to access the surgical site. Blood vessels may be clamped or cauterized to prevent bleeding, and retractors may be used to expose the site or keep the incision open. The approach to the surgical site may involve several layers of incision and dissection, as in abdominal surgery, where the incision must traverse skin, subcutaneous tissue, three layers of muscle and then the peritoneum. In certain cases, bone may be cut to further access the interior of the body; for example, cutting the skull for brain surgery or cutting the sternum for thoracic (chest) surgery to open up the rib cage. Whilst in surgery aseptic technique is used to prevent infection or further spreading of the disease. The surgeons' and assistants' hands, wrists and forearms are washed thoroughly for at least 4 minutes to prevent germs getting into the operative field, then sterile gloves are placed onto their hands. An antiseptic solution is applied to the area of the patient's body that will be operated on. Sterile drapes are placed around the operative site. Surgical masks are worn by the surgical team to avoid germs on droplets of liquid from their mouths and noses from contaminating the operative site.\n\nWork to correct the problem in body then proceeds. This work may involve:\n\nBlood or blood expanders may be administered to compensate for blood lost during surgery. Once the procedure is complete, sutures or staples are used to close the incision. Once the incision is closed, the anesthetic agents are stopped or reversed, and the patient is taken off ventilation and extubated (if general anesthesia was administered).\n\nAfter completion of surgery, the patient is transferred to the post anesthesia care unit and closely monitored. When the patient is judged to have recovered from the anesthesia, he/she is either transferred to a surgical ward elsewhere in the hospital or discharged home. During the post-operative period, the patient's general function is assessed, the outcome of the procedure is assessed, and the surgical site is checked for signs of infection. There are several risk factors associated with postoperative complications, such as immune deficiency and obesity. Obesity has long been considered a risk factor for adverse post-surgical outcomes. It has been linked to many disorders such as obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atelectasis and pulmonary embolism, adverse cardiovascular effects, and wound healing complications. If removable skin closures are used, they are removed after 7 to 10 days post-operatively, or after healing of the incision is well under way.\n\nIt is not uncommon for surgical drains (see Drain (surgery)) to be required to remove blood or fluid from the surgical wound during recovery. Mostly these drains stay in until the volume tapers off, then they are removed. These drains can become clogged, leading to abscess.\n\nPostoperative therapy may include adjuvant treatment such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or administration of medication such as anti-rejection medication for transplants. Other follow-up studies or rehabilitation may be prescribed during and after the recovery period.\n\nThe use of topical antibiotics on surgical wounds to reduce infection rates has been questioned. Antibiotic ointments are likely to irritate the skin, slow healing, and could increase risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. It has also been suggested that topical antibiotics should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative. A systematic review published by Cochrane (organisation) in 2016, though, concluded that topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds reduce the risk of surgical site infections, when compared to no treatment or use of antiseptics. The review also did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that topical antibiotics increased the risk of local skin reactions or antibiotic resistance.\n\nThrough a retrospective analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer availability of services on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.\n\nIn 2011, of the 38.6 million hospital stays in U.S. hospitals, 29% included at least one operating room procedure. These stays accounted for 48% of the total $387 billion in hospital costs.\n\nThe overall number of procedures remained stable from 2001 to 2011. In 2011, over 15 million operating room procedures were performed in U.S. hospitals.\n\nData from 2003 to 2011 showed that U.S. hospital costs were highest for the surgical service line; the surgical service line costs were $17,600 in 2003 and projected to be $22,500 in 2013. For hospital stays in 2012 in the United States, private insurance had the highest percentage of surgical expenditure. in 2012, mean hospital costs in the United States were highest for surgical stays.\n\nOlder adults have widely varying physical health. Frail elderly people are at significant risk of post-surgical complications and the need for extended care. Assessment of older patients before elective surgery can accurately predict the patients' recovery trajectories. One frailty scale uses five items: unintentional weight loss, muscle weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed. A healthy person scores 0; a very frail person scores 5. Compared to non-frail elderly people, people with intermediate frailty scores (2 or 3) are twice as likely to have post-surgical complications, spend 50% more time in the hospital, and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes. Frail elderly patients (score of 4 or 5) have even worse outcomes, with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non-frail elderly people.\n\nSurgery on children requires considerations which are not common in adult surgery. Children and adolescents are still developing physically and mentally making it difficult for them to make informed decisions and give consent for surgical treatments. Bariatric surgery in youth is among the controversial topics related to surgery in children.\nDoctors perform surgery with the consent of the patient. Some patients are able to give better informed consent than others. Populations such as incarcerated persons, people living with dementia, the mentally incompetent, persons subject to coercion, and other people who are not able to make decisions with the same authority as a typical patient have special needs when making decisions about their personal healthcare, including surgery.\n\nIn 2014, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was launched to examine the case for surgery as an integral component of global health care and to provide recommendations regarding the delivery of surgical and anesthesia services in low and middle income countries. Amongst the conclusions in this study, two primary conclusions were reached:\n\nGlobally, 4.2 million people are estimated to die within 30 days of surgery each year, with half of these occurring in low- and middle-income countries. A prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery from 357 centres across 58 countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-human development index (HDI) countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1·6 per cent at 24 hours (high HDI 1·1 per cent, middle HDI 1·9 per cent, low HDI 3·4 per cent), increasing to 5·4 per cent by 30 days (high HDI 4·5 per cent, middle HDI 6·0 per cent, low HDI 8·6 per cent; P < 0·001). A sub-study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency abdominal surgery from 253 centres across 43 countries found that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries. This translate to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist associated with reduced mortality at 30 days.\n\nAccess to surgical care is increasingly recognized as an integral aspect of healthcare, and therefore is evolving into a normative derivation of human right to health. The ICESCR Article 12.1 and 12.2 define the human right to health as \"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\" In the August 2000, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) interpreted this to mean \"right to the enjoyment of a variety of facilities, goods, services, and conditions necessary for the realization of the highest attainable health\". Surgical care can be thereby viewed as a positive right – an entitlement to protective healthcare.\n\nWoven through the International Human and Health Rights literature is the right to be free from surgical disease. The 1966 ICESCR Article 12.2a described the need for \"provision for the reduction of the stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development of the child\" which was subsequently interpreted to mean “requiring measures to improve… emergency obstetric services”. Article 12.2d of the ICESCR stipulates the need for “the creation of conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness”, and is interpreted in the 2000 comment to include timely access to “basic preventative, curative services… for appropriate treatment of injury and disability.\". Obstetric care shares close ties with reproductive rights, which includes access to reproductive health.\n\nSurgeons and public health advocates, such as Kelly McQueen, have described surgery as \"Integral to the right to health\". This is reflected in the establishment of the WHO Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care in 2005, the 2013 formation of the Lancet Commission for Global Surgery, the 2015 World Bank Publication of Volume 1 of its Disease Control Priorities \"Essential Surgery\", and the 2015 World Health Assembly 68.15 passing of the Resolution for Strengthening Emergency and Essential Surgical Care and Anesthesia as a Component of Universal Health Coverage. The Lancet Commission for Global Surgery outlined the need for access to \"available, affordable, timely and safe\" surgical and anesthesia care; dimensions paralleled in ICESCR General Comment No. 14, which similarly outlines need for available, accessible, affordable and timely healthcare.\n\nSurgical treatments date back to the prehistoric era. The oldest for which there is evidence is trepanation, in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull, thus exposing the dura mater in order to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases.\n\nPrehistoric surgical techniques are seen in Ancient Egypt, where a mandible dated to approximately 2650 BC shows two perforations just below the root of the first molar, indicating the draining of an abscessed tooth. Surgical texts from ancient Egypt date back about 3500 years ago. Surgical operations were performed by priests, specialized in medical treatments similar to today, and used sutures to close wounds. Infections were treated with honey.\n\nRemains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300 BC) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years. Susruta was an ancient Indian surgeon commonly credited as the author of the treatise Sushruta Samhita. He is dubbed as the \"founding father of surgery\" and his period is usually placed between the period of 1200–600 BC. One of the earliest known mention of the name is from the \"Bower Manuscript\" where Sushruta is listed as one of the ten sages residing in the Himalayas. Texts also suggest that he learned surgery at Kasi from Lord Dhanvantari, the god of medicine in Hindu mythology. It is one of the oldest known surgical texts and it describes in detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments, as well as procedures on performing various forms of cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery and rhinoplasty.\n\nIn ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as \"Asclepieia\" (, sing. \"Asclepieion\" \"Ασκληπιείον\"), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place. The Greek Galen was one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations – including brain and eye surgery – that were not tried again for almost two millennia.\n\nSurgery was developed to a high degree in the Islamic world. Abulcasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi), an Andalusian-Arab physician and scientist who practiced in the Zahra suburb of Córdoba. His works on surgery, largely based upon Paul of Aegina's \"Pragmateia\", were influential.\n\nIn Europe, the demand grew for surgeons to formally study for many years before practicing; universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the 12th century, Rogerius Salernitanus composed his \"Chirurgia\", laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Barber-surgeons generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field. Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as Halsteads principles.\n\nThere were some important advances to the art of surgery during this period. The professor of anatomy at the University of Padua, Andreas Vesalius, was a pivotal figure in the Renaissance transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of Galen, to an empirical approach of 'hands-on' dissection. In his anatomic treatis \"De humani corporis fabrica\", he exposed the many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves.\n\nThe second figure of importance in this era was Ambroise Paré (sometimes spelled \"Ambrose\"), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590. The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil; an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Paré began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of egg yolk, rose oil and turpentine. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective ligation of the blood vessels during an amputation.\n\nThe discipline of surgery was put on a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the Scottish surgical scientist, John Hunter, generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery. He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others, he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter. To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.\n\nHe greatly advanced knowledge of venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing damage to the Achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries in case of an aneurysm. He was also one of the first to understand the importance of pathology, the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound, bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any benefit that was gained from the intervention. He consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort.\n\nOther important 18th- and early 19th-century surgeons included Percival Pott (1713–1788) who described tuberculosis on the spine and first demonstrated that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen (he noticed a connection between chimney sweep's exposure to soot and their high incidence of scrotal cancer). Astley Paston Cooper (1768–1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta, and James Syme (1799–1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation.o\n\nModern pain control through anesthesia was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of anesthesia, surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient suffering. This also meant that operations were largely restricted to amputations and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long, and chloroform, discovered by Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson and later pioneered by John Snow, physician to Queen Victoria. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications.\n\nUnfortunately, the introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections. The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths; however, the Royal Society dismissed his advice.\n\nUntil the pioneering work of British surgeon Joseph Lister in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see \"miasma\") was responsible for infections in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient's wounds were not available. Lister became aware of the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur, who showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if micro-organisms were present. Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the micro-organisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying carbolic acid on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in \"The Lancet\". Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the \"Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery\", which was reprinted in \"The British Medical Journal\". His work was groundbreaking and laid the foundations for a rapid advance in infection control that saw modern antiseptic operating theatres widely used within 50 years.\n\nLister continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister introduced the Steam Steriliser to sterilize equipment, instituted rigorous hand washing and later implemented the wearing of rubber gloves. These three crucial advances – the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment – laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today.\n\nThe use of X-rays as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated photographic plate.\n\n"}
{"id": "45728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45728", "title": "Hamburger", "text": "Hamburger\n\nA hamburger (short: burger) is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, or \"special sauce\"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.\n\nThe term \"burger\" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term \"patty\" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity \"burger\" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, or veggie burger.\n\nHamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.\n\nThe term \"hamburger\" originally derives from Hamburg, Germany's second-largest city. In German, \"Burg\" means \"castle\", \"fortified settlement\" or \"fortified refuge\" and is a widespread component of place names. The first element of the name is perhaps from Old High German \"hamma\", referring to a bend in a river, or Middle High German \"hamme\", referring to an enclosed area of pastureland. \"Hamburger\" in German is the demonym of Hamburg, similar to \"frankfurter\" and \"wiener\", names for other meat-based foods and demonyms of the cities of Frankfurt and Vienna respectively.\n\nThe term \"burger\" eventually became a suffix back-formation that is associated with many different types of sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, turkey, elk, lamb or fish like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.\n\nThere have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger, but the origins remain unclear. The popular book \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as \"Hamburgh sausage\", which suggested to serve it \"roasted with toasted bread under it\". A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name \"Rundstück warm\" (\"bread roll warm\") in 1869 or earlier, and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller. Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the Hamburg America Line, which began operations in 1847. Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name.\n\nThere is a reference to a \"Hamburg steak\" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal. On July 5, 1896, the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" made a highly specific claim regarding a \"hamburger sandwich\" in an article about a \"Sandwich Car\": \"A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range.\"\n\nAccording to Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis. White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the \"New York Tribune\" referred to the hamburger as \"the innovation of a food vendor on the pike\". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: \"One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.\"\n\nLouis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900. \"New York\" magazine states that \"The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later\", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute. A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast. Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for \"New York Magazine\", claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.\n\nOne of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair. The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as \"Hamburger Charlie\", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.\n\nAccording to White Castle, Otto Kuase was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891 he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors would later omit the fried egg.\n\nThe family of Oscar Weber Bilby claim the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891 on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun. In 1995, Governor Frank Keating proclaimed that the first true hamburger on a bun was created and consumed in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1891, calling Tulsa, \"The Real Birthplace of the Hamburger.\"\n\nFrank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in Hamburg, New York. During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef. Kunzog, who spoke to Frank Menches, says they exhausted their supply of sausage, so purchased chopped up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874. The story notes that the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York not Hamburg, Germany. Frank Menches's obituary in \"The New York Times\" states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in Akron, Ohio.\n\nFletcher Davis of Athens, Texas claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, in the 1880s he opened a lunch counter in Athens and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side. The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair. Historian Frank X. Tolbert, noted that Athens resident Clint Murchison said his grandfather dated the hamburger to the 1880s with 'Old Dave' a.k.a. Fletcher Davis. A photo of \"Old Dave's Hamburger Stand\" from 1904 was sent to Tolbert as evidence of the claim.\n\nVarious non-specific claims of invention relate to the term \"hamburger steak\" without mention of its being a sandwich. The first printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New York. However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834. In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.\n\nBetween 1871 and 1884, \"Hamburg Beefsteak\" was on the \"Breakfast and Supper Menu\" of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in San Fernando, California. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig's feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only \"Pig's Head,\" \"Calf Tongue,\" and \"Stewed Kidneys\" were listed. Another claim ties the hamburger to Summit County, New York or Ohio. Summit County, Ohio exists, but Summit County, New York does not.\n\n\nHamburgers are usually a feature of fast food restaurants. The hamburgers served in major fast food establishments are usually mass-produced in factories and frozen for delivery to the site. These hamburgers are thin and of uniform thickness, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from ground beef. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as Wendy's, sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat-top, but some firms, such as Burger King, use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered \"rare\", but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.\n\nThe McDonald's fast-food chain sells the Big Mac, one of the world's top selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States. Other major fast-food chains, including Burger King (also known as Hungry Jack's in Australia), A&W, Culver's, Whataburger, Carl's Jr./Hardee's chain, Wendy's (known for their square patties), Jack in the Box, Cook Out, Harvey's, Shake Shack, In-N-Out Burger, Five Guys, Fatburger, Vera's, Burgerville, Back Yard Burgers, Lick's Homeburger, Roy Rogers, Smashburger, and Sonic also rely heavily on hamburger sales. Fuddruckers and Red Robin are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier \"restaurant-style\" variety of hamburgers.\n\nSome restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the Bobby's Burger Palace chain founded by well-known chef and Food Network star Bobby Flay.\n\nHamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.\nA high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings; these may be described as \"all-beef hamburger\" or \"all-beef patties\" to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added flour, textured vegetable protein, ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings (which the company Beef Products Inc, calls \"lean finely textured beef\"), advanced meat recovery, or other fillers. In the 1930s ground liver was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like eggs or breadcrumbs. Seasonings may include salt and pepper and others like as parsley, onions, soy sauce, Thousand Island dressing, onion soup mix, or Worcestershire sauce. Many name brand seasoned salt products are also used.\n\nRaw hamburger may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illness such as , due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is needed during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the USDA recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of . If cooked to this temperature, they are considered well-done.\n\nBurgers can also be made with patties made from ingredients other than beef. For example, a \"turkey burger\" uses ground turkey meat, a \"chicken burger\" uses ground chicken meat. A \"buffalo burger\" uses ground meat from a bison, and an \"ostrich burger\" is made from ground seasoned ostrich meat. A deer burger uses ground venison from deer.\n\nA \"veggie burger\", \"black bean burger\", \"garden burger\", or \"tofu burger\" uses a meat analogue, a meat substitute such as tofu, TVP, seitan (wheat gluten), quorn, beans, grains or an assortment of vegetables, ground up and mashed into patties.\n\nA steak burger is marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality. or, in Australia, a sandwich containing a steak.\n\nSteak burgers are first mentioned in the 1920s. Like other hamburgers, they may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings.\n\nUse of the term \"steakburger\" dates to the 1920s in the United States. In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. \"Gus\" Belt, the founder of Steak 'n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a \"steakburger\" to customers at the company's first location in Normal, Illinois. This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation. Steak burgers are a primary menu item at Steak 'n Shake restaurants, and the company's registered trademarks included \"original steakburger\" and \"famous for steakburgers\". Steak 'n Shake's \"Prime Steakburgers\" are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.\n\nBeef is typical, although other meats such as lamb and pork may also be used. The meat is ground or chopped.\n\nIn Australia, a steak burger is a steak sandwich which contains a whole steak, not ground meat.\n\nSteak burgers may be cooked to various degrees of doneness.\n\nSteak burgers may be served with standard hamburger toppings such as lettuce, onion, and tomato. Some may have additional various toppings such as cheese, bacon, fried egg, mushrooms, additional meats, and others.\n\nVarious fast food outlets and restaurants such as Burger King, Carl's Jr., Hardee's, IHOP, Steak 'n Shake, Mr. Steak, and Freddy's market steak burgers. Some restaurants offer high-end burgers prepared from aged beef. Additionally, many restaurants have used the term \"steak burger\" at various times.\n\nSome baseball parks concessions in the United States call their hamburgers steak burgers, such as Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nBurger King introduced the Sirloin Steak sandwich in 1979 as part of a menu expansion that in turn was part of a corporate restructuring effort for the company. It was a single oblong patty made of chopped steak served on a sub-style, sesame seed roll. Additional steak burgers that Burger King has offered are the Angus Bacon Cheddar Ranch Steak Burger, the Angus Bacon & Cheese Steak Burger, and a limited edition Stuffed Steakhouse Burger.\n\nIn 2004 Steak 'n Shake sued Burger King over the latter's use of term \"Steak Burger\" in conjunction with one of its menu items, claiming that such use infringed on trademark rights.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, burgers may be classified as two main types: fast food hamburgers and individually prepared burgers made in homes and restaurants. The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including lettuce, tomato, onion, and often sliced pickles (or pickle relish). French fries often accompany the burger. Cheese (usually processed cheese slices but often Cheddar, Swiss, pepper jack, or blue), either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top, is generally an option.\n\nCondiments might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side including mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, salad dressings and barbecue sauce.\n\nOther toppings can include bacon, avocado or guacamole, sliced sautéed mushrooms, cheese sauce, chili (usually without beans), fried egg, scrambled egg, feta cheese, blue cheese, salsa, pineapple, jalapeños and other kinds of chili peppers, anchovies, slices of ham or bologna, pastrami or teriyaki-seasoned beef, tartar sauce, french fries, onion rings or potato chips.\n\n\nIn Mexico, burgers (called \"hamburguesas\") are served with ham and slices of American cheese fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include avocado, jalapeño slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a \"Hawaiian hamburger\".\n\nSome restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others also replace the ground patty with sirloin, Al pastor meat, barbacoa or a fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the United States can be found all over Mexico, including Carl's Jr., Sonic, as well as global chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.\n\nHamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the High Street is dominated by the same big two chains as in the U.S. — McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland the food outlet Supermacs is widespread throughout the country serving burgers as part of its menu. In Ireland, Abrakebabra (started out selling kebabs) and Eddie Rocket's are also major chains.\n\nAn original and indigenous rival to the big two U.S. giants was the quintessentially British fast-food chain Wimpy, originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style chips, accompanied by cutlery and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's, Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, Grand Metropolitan. A management buyout in 1990 split the brands again and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centres whilst new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at motorway service stations.\n\nHamburgers are also available from mobile kiosks, commonly known as “burger vans\", particularly at outdoor events such as football matches. Burgers from this type of outlet are usually served without any form of salad — only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard or brown sauce.\n\nChip shops, particularly in the West Midlands and North-East of England, Scotland and Ireland, serve battered hamburgers called batter burgers. This is where the burger patty, by itself, is deep-fat-fried in batter and is usually served with chips.\n\nHamburgers and veggie burgers served with chips and salad, are standard pub grub menu items. Many pubs specialize in \"gourmet\" burgers. These are usually high quality minced steak patties, topped with items such as blue cheese, brie, avocado et cetera. Some British pubs serve burger patties made from more exotic meats including venison burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), bison burgers, ostrich burgers and in some Australian themed pubs even kangaroo burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served in a similar way to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce and plum sauce.\n\nIn the early 21st century \"premium\" hamburger chain and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often organic, usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take away. Chains include Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union and Byron Hamburgers in London. Independent restaurants such as Meatmarket and Dirty Burger developed a style of rich, juicy burger in 2012 which is known as a \"dirty burger\" or \"third-wave burger\".\n\nIn recent years Rustlers has sold pre-cooked hamburgers reheatable in a microwave oven in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the UK, as in North America and Japan, the term \"burger\" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.\n\nFast food franchises sell American style fast food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional Australasian hamburgers are usually bought from fish and chip shops or milk bars. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or \"mince\" as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They commonly include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion and meat as minimum, and can optionally include cheese, beetroot, pineapple, a fried egg and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included it is known in Australia as \"burger with the lot\".\nThe term 'burger' is also applied to any hot sandwich using a bun for the bread, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger (generally with chicken breast rather than chicken mince), salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. The term 'sandwich' is usually only applied when the bread used is sliced bread.\n\nThe only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to \"The Lot\" often contains a steak (beef) as well. The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and tomato sauce. The McDonald's \"McOz\" Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a Kiwiburger, similar to a Quarter Pounder, but features salad, beetroot and a fried egg. The Hungry Jack's (Burger King) \"Aussie Burger\" has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup and a meat patty.\n\nIn China, restaurants such as McDonald's and KFC exist, which sell hamburgers.\n\nIn Japan, hamburgers can be served in a bun, called \"hanbāgā\" (ハンバーガー), or just the patties served without a bun, known as \"hanbāgu\" (ハンバーグ) or \"hamburg\", short for \"hamburg steak\".\n\n\"Hamburg steaks\" (served without buns) are similar to what are known as Salisbury steaks in the U.S. They are made from minced beef, pork or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, egg, breadcrumbs and spices. They are served with brown sauce (or demi-glace in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in Japanese curries. Hamburgers may be served in casual, western style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as \"family restaurants\".\n\nHamburgers in buns, on the other hand, are predominantly the domain of fast food chains. Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as MOS Burger, First Kitchen and Freshness Burger. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include teriyaki burgers, \"katsu\" burgers (containing tonkatsu) and burgers containing shrimp korokke. Some of the more unusual examples include the rice burger, where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1000-yen (US$10) \"Takumi Burger\" (meaning \"artisan taste\"), featuring avocados, freshly grated wasabi, and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with Kobe beef, butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently launched a McPork burger, made with U.S. pork. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains, due in part to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, \"upscale\" hamburger offerings. Burger King once retreated from Japan, but re-entered the market in Summer 2007 in cooperation with the Korean owned Japanese fast-food chain Lotteria.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, a Japanese man, Takeru Kobayashi ate the greatest number of hamburgers in three minutes on July 11, 2014.\n\nRice burgers, mentioned above, are also available in several East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. Lotteria is a big hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean Lotte group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they also have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include Bulgogi burgers and Kimchi burgers.\n\nIn the Philippines, a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain McDonald's (locally nicknamed \"McDo\") have a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain steamed rice or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger-chain called Jollibee, which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called \"Champ\". Jollibee now has a number of outlets in the United States, the Middle East and East Asia.\n\nIn India, burgers are usually made from chicken or vegetable patties due to cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from Hindu religious practice) and pork (which stems from Islamic religious practice). Because of this, the majority of fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India, for instance, does not serve beef, offering the \"Maharaja Mac\" instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken. Another version of the Indian vegetarian burger is the Wada Pav consisting deep-fried potato patty dipped in gramflour batter. It is usually served with mint chutney and fried green chili.\n\nIn Pakistan, apart from American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas, the best known being the \"shami burger\". This is made from \"shami kebab\", made by mixing lentil and minced lamb. Onions, scrambled egg and ketchup are the most may be toppings.\n\nIn Malaysia there are 300 McDonald's restaurants. The menu in Malaysia also includes eggs and fried chicken on top of the regular burgers. Burgers are also easily found at nearby mobile kiosks, especially Ramly Burger.\n\nIn Mongolia, a recent fast food craze due to the sudden influx of foreign influence has led to the prominence of the hamburger. Specialized fast food restaurants serving to Mongolian tastes have sprung up and seen great success.\nIn Turkey, in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger (lit. \"Wet-Burger\"), which a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb-burgers and offal-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and Burger King. Most burger shops have also adopted a pizzeria-like approach when it comes to home delivery, and almost all major fast food chains deliver.\n\nIn the former Yugoslavia, and originally in Serbia, there is a local version of the hamburger known as the \"pljeskavica\". It is often served as a patty, but may have a bun as well.\n\nThroughout Belgium and in some eateries in the Netherlands, a Bicky Burger is sold that combines pork, chicken, and horse meat. The hamburger, usually fried, is served between a bun, sprinkled with sesame seeds. It often comes with a specific \"Bickysaus\" (Bicky dressing) made with mayonnaise, mustard, cabbage, and onion.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45784", "title": "Biomimetics", "text": "Biomimetics\n\nBiomimetics or biomimicry is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems. The terms \"biomimetics\" and \"biomimicry\" derive from (\"bios\"), life, and μίμησις (\"mīmēsis\"), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (\"mīmeisthai\"), to imitate, from μῖμος (\"mimos\"), actor. A closely related field is bionics.\n\nLiving organisms have evolved well-adapted structures and materials over geological time through natural selection. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by biological solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, hydrophobicity, self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.\n\nOne of the early examples of would-be biomimicry was the study of birds to enable human flight. Although never successful in creating a \"flying machine\", Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of \"flying machines\". The Wright Brothers, who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight. During the 1950s the American biophysicist and polymath Otto Schmitt developed the concept of \"biomimetics\". During his doctoral research he developed the Schmitt trigger by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of nerve propagation. He continued to focus on devices that mimic natural systems and by 1957 he had perceived a converse to the standard view of biophysics at that time, a view he would come to call biomimetics.\n\nIn 1960 Jack E. Steele coined a similar term, \"bionics\", at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as \"the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues\". During a later meeting in 1963 Schmitt stated,\n\nIn 1969 Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers, and by 1974 it had found its way into Webster's Dictionary, bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as \"a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems\". Bionic took on a different connotation when Martin Caidin referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel \"Cyborg\" which later resulted in the 1974 television series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with \"the use of electronically operated artificial body parts\" and \"having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices\". Because the term \"bionic\" took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in English speaking countries largely abandoned it.\n\nThe term \"biomimicry\" appeared as early as 1982. Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author Janine Benyus in her 1997 book \"Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature\". Biomimicry is defined in the book as a \"new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems\". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a \"Model, Measure, and Mentor\" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.\n\nBiomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes. Murray's law, which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.\n\nAircraft wing design and flight techniques are being inspired by birds and bats. Biorobots based on the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals include BionicKangaroo which moves like a kangaroo, saving energy from one jump and transferring it to its next jump. Kamigami Robots, a children's toy, mimic cockroach locomotion to run quickly and efficiently over indoor and outdoor surfaces.\n\nResearchers studied the termite's ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their termite mounds in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from 1.5 °C to 40 °C (35 °F to 104 °F). Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human building design. The Eastgate Centre, a mid-rise office complex in Harare, Zimbabwe, stays cool without air conditioning and uses only 10% of the energy of a conventional building of the same size.\n\nIn structural engineering, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) has incorporated biomimetic characteristics in an adaptive deployable \"tensegrity\" bridge. The bridge can carry out self-diagnosis and self-repair. The arrangement of leaves on a plant has been adapted for better solar power collection.\n\nAnalysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinisator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower \"Strelitzia reginae\" (known as Bird-of-Paradise flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the University of Freiburg and University of Stuttgart for the creation of hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment. These bio-inspired products is sold under the name Flectofin.\n\nOther hingeless bioinspired system includes Flectofold. Flectofold has been inspired from the trapping system developed by the carnivorous plant \"Aldrovanda vesiculosa\".\n\nThere is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of stiffness, strength and toughness.\n\nSuch materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from nano- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. Bone, nacre (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials. The exceptional resistance to fracture of bone is due to complex deformation and toughening mechanisms that operate at spanning different size scales - nanoscale structure of protein molecules to macroscopic physiological scale. Nacre exhibits similar mechanical properties however with rather simpler structure. Nacre shows a brick and mortar llike structure with thick mineral layer (0.2∼0.9-μm) of closely packed aragonite structures and thin organic matrix (∼20-nm). While thin films and micrometer sized samples that mimic these structures are already produced, successful production of bulk biomimetic structural materials is yet to be realized. However, numerous processing techniques have been proposed for producing nacre like materials.\n\nBiomorphic mineralization is a technique that produces materials with morphologies and structures resembling those of natural living organisms by using bio-structures as templates for mineralization. Compared to other methods of material production, biomorphic mineralization is facile, environmentally benign and economic.\n\nFreeze casting (Ice templating), an inexpensive method to mimic natural layered structures was employed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to create alumina-Al-Si and IT HAP-epoxy layered composites that match the mechanical properties of bone with an equivalent mineral/ organic content. Various further studies also employed similar methods to produce high strength and high toughness composites involving a variety of constituent phases.\n\nRecent studies demonstrated production of cohesive and self supporting macroscopic tissue constructs that mimic living tissues by printing tens of thousands of heterologous picoliter droplets in software-defined, 3D millimeter-scale geometries. Efforts are also taken up to mimic the design of nacre in artificial composite materials using fused deposition modelling and the helicoidal structures of stomatopod clubs in the fabrication of high performance carbon fiber-epoxy composites.\n\nVarious established and novel additive manufacturing technologies like PolyJet printing, direct ink writing, 3D magnetic printing, multi-material magnetically assisted 3D printing and magnetically-assisted slip casting have also been utilized to mimic the complex micro-scale architectures of natural materials and provide huge scope for future research.\n\nSpider web silk is as strong as the Kevlar used in bulletproof vests. Engineers could in principle use such a material, if it could be reengineered to have a long enough life, for parachute lines, suspension bridge cables, artificial ligaments for medicine, and other purposes. The self-sharpening teeth of many animals have been copied to make better cutting tools.\n\nNew ceramics that exhibit giant electret hysteresis have also been realized.\n\nIn general in biological systems, self healing occurs via chemical signals released at the site of fracture which initiate a systemic response that transport repairing agents to the fracture site thereby promoting autonomic healing. To demonstrate the use of micro-vascular networks for autonomic healing, researchers developed a microvascular coating–substrate architecture that mimics human skin. Bio-inspired self-healing structural color hydrogels that maintain the stability of an inverse opal structure and its resultant structural colors were developed. A self-repairing membrane inspired by rapid self-sealing processes in plants was developed for inflatable light weight structures such as rubber boats or Tensairity® constructions. The researchers applied a thin soft cellular polyurethane foam coating on the inside of a fabric substrate, which closes the crack if the membrane is punctured with a spike. Self-healing materials, polymers and composite materials capable of mending cracks have been produced based on biological materials.\n\nSurfaces that recreate properties of shark skin are intended to enable more efficient movement through water. Efforts have been made to produce fabric that emulates shark skin.\n\nSurface tension biomimetics are being researched for technologies such as hydrophobic or hydrophilic coatings and microactuators.\n\nSome amphibians, such as tree and torrent frogs and arboreal salamanders, are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface. Tire treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of tree frogs.\n\nMarine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols. Other research has proposed adhesive glue from mussels.\n\nLeg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g. beetles and flies), spiders and lizards (e.g. geckos), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as setae. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots, boots and tape. Synthetic setae have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.\n\nBiomimetic materials are gaining increasing attention in the field of optics and photonics. There are still little known bioinspired or biomimetic products involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products. \nFor instance, the chiral self-assembly of cellulose inspired by the \"Pollia condensata\" berry has been exploited to make optically active films. Such films are made from cellulose which is a biodegradable and biobased resource obtained from wood or cotton. The structural colours can potentially be everlasting and have more vibrant colour than the ones obtained from chemical absorption of light. \"Pollia condensata\" is not the only fruit showing a structural coloured skin, other berries such as \"Margaritaria nobilis\" does. These fruits show iridescent colors in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum which gives the fruit a strong metallic and shiny visual appearance. The structural colours come from the organisation of cellulose chains in the fruit's epicarp, a part of the fruit skin. Each cell of the epicarp is made of a multilayered envelope that behaves like a Bragg reflector. However, the light which is reflected from the skin of these fruits is not polarised unlike the one arising from man-made replicates obtained from the self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into helicoids, which only reflect left-handed circularly polarised light.\n\nThe fruit of \"Elaeocarpus angustifolius\" also show structural colour that come arises from the presence of specialised cells called iridosomes which have layered structures. Similar iridosomes have also been found in Delarbrea michieana fruits.\n\nIn plants, multi layer structures can be found either at the surface of the leaves (on top of the epidermis), such as in \"Selaginella willdenowii\" or within specialized intra-cellular organelles, the so-called iridoplasts, which are located inside the cells of the upper epidermis. For instance, the rain forest plants Begonia pavonina have iridoplasts located inside the epidermal cells.\n\nStructural colours have also been found in several algae, such as in the red alga \"Chondrus crispus\" (Irish Moss).\n\nStructural coloration produces the rainbow colours of soap bubbles, butterfly wings and many beetle scales. Phase-separation has been used to fabricate ultra-white scattering membranes from polymethylmethacrylate, mimicking the beetle \"Cyphochilus\".\n\n\"Morpho\" butterfly wings are structurally coloured to produce a vibrant blue that does not vary with angle. This effect can be mimicked by a variety of technologies. Lotus Cars claim to have developed a paint that mimics the \"Morpho\" butterfly's structural blue colour. In 2007, Qualcomm commercialised an interferometric modulator display technology, \"Mirasol\", using \"Morpho\"-like optical interference. In 2010, the dressmaker Donna Sgro made a dress from Teijin Fibers' Morphotex, an undyed fabric woven from structurally coloured fibres, mimicking the microstructure of \"Morpho\" butterfly wing scales.\n\nHolistic planned grazing, using fencing and/or herders, seeks to restore grasslands by carefully planning movements of large herds of livestock to mimic the vast herds found in nature. The natural system being mimicked and used as a template is grazing animals concentrated by pack predators that must move on after eating, trampling, and manuring an area, and returning only after it has fully recovered. Developed by Allan Savory, who in turn was inspired by the work of André Voisin, this method of grazing holds tremendous potential in building soil, increasing biodiversity, reversing desertification, and mitigating global warming, similar to what occurred during the past 40 million years as the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems built deep grassland soils, sequestering carbon and cooling the planet.\n\nPermaculture is a set of design principles centered around whole systems thinking, simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and resilient features observed in natural ecosystems. It uses these principles in a growing number of fields from regenerative agriculture, rewilding, community, and organizational design and development.\n\nProtein folding has been used to control material formation for self-assembled functional nanostructures. Polar bear fur has inspired the design of thermal collectors and clothing. The light refractive properties of the moth's eye has been studied to reduce the reflectivity of solar panels. \n\nThe Bombardier beetle's powerful repellent spray inspired a Swedish company to develop a \"micro mist\" spray technology, which is claimed to have a low carbon impact (compared to aerosol sprays). The beetle mixes chemicals and releases its spray via a steerable nozzle at the end of its abdomen, stinging and confusing the victim.\n\nMost viruses have an outer capsule 20 to 300 nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60 °C; they are stable across the pH range 2-10. Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. This was demonstrated through the production of platinum and gold nanotubes using TMV as a template. Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, PbS, and CdS and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material. A spherical plant virus called cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5. Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2 nm begin to exchange substance with the environment. The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in Biomorphic mineralization for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH. Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot semiconductor nanoparticles through a series of pH washes. This is an alternative to the apoferritin cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles. Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46173", "title": "Fish and chips", "text": "Fish and chips\n\nFish and chips is a hot dish of English origin consisting of fried fish in batter served with chips. It is a common take-away food within the United Kingdom and an early example of culinary fusion. Fish and chips first appeared in the UK in the 1860s. By 1910 there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and by the 1930s there were over 35,000. Fish and chips are now a staple takeaway meal in numerous countries, particularly in English-speaking and Commonwealth countries such as, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.\n\nThe tradition in the UK of fish battered and fried in oil may have come from Jewish immigrants from Spain and Portugal. Originally, Western Sephardic Jews settling in England as early as the 16th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to \"pescado frito\", which is coated in flour then fried in oil. Charles Dickens mentions \"fried fish warehouses\" in \"Oliver Twist\" (1838), and in 1845 Alexis Soyer in his first edition of \"A Shilling cookery for the People\", gives a recipe for \"Fried fish, Jewish fashion\", which is dipped in a batter of flour and water.\nThe exact location of the first fish and chip shop is unclear. The earliest known shops were opened in the 1860s, in London by Joseph Malin and in Mossley, near Oldham, Lancashire, by John Lees. However, fried fish, as well as chips, had existed independently for at least fifty years, so the possibility that they had been combined at an earlier time cannot be ruled out.\n\nFish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea, and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century, so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas.\n\nDeep-fried chips (slices or pieces of potato) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period: the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes as its earliest usage of \"chips\" in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1859): \"Husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil\".\n\nThe modern fish-and-chip shop (\"chippy\" or \"chipper\" in modern British slang) originated in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early fish-and-chip shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat, heated by a coal fire. The fish-and-chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format, with the food served, in paper wrappings, to queuing customers, over a counter in front of the fryers. \nBy 1910, there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country, and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops. As a boy Alfred Hitchcock lived above a fish and chip shop in London, which was the family business. According to Professor John Walton, author of \"Fish and Chips and the British Working Class\", the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority: \"The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart, unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed\". \n\nIn 1928, Harry Ramsden opened his first fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the \"Guinness Book of Records\". In George Orwell's \"The Road to Wigan Pier\" (1937), which documents his experience of working class life in the north of England, the author considered fish and chips chief among the 'home comforts' which acted as a panacea to the working classes. During World War II, fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to\nrationing. Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as \"the good companions\". John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips—a staple of the working class—smothered in ketchup.\n\nBritish fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased, with plain paper, cardboard, or plastic being used instead. In the United Kingdom, the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities (Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products) Regulations 2003 respectively enact directive 2065/2001/EC, and generally mean that \"fish\" must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named; so, for example, \"cod and chips\" now appears on menus rather than the more vague \"fish and chips\". In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it cannot be sold merely as \"fish and chips\".\n\nA prominent meal in British culture, the dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century: Charles Dickens mentions a \"fried fish warehouse\" in \"Oliver Twist\", first published in 1838, while in the north of England a trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes developed. The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish-and-chip shop industry we know. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded combined fish-and-chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England, in Mossley, in 1863.\n\nThe concept of a fish restaurant, as opposed to take-away, was introduced by Samuel Isaacs (born 1856 in Whitechapel, London; died 1939 in Brighton, Sussex) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century. Isaacs' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips, bread and butter, and tea for nine pence, and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain.\n\nThe restaurants were carpeted, had table service, tablecloths, flowers, china and cutlery, and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time. They were located in Tottenham Court Road, St Pancras, The Strand, Hoxton, Shoreditch, Brixton and other London districts, as well as Clacton, Brighton, Ramsgate, Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England. Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants. Sam Isaacs' trademark was the phrase \"This is the Plaice\", combined with a picture of the punned-upon fish in question. A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No.1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom's 1955 film \"One Good Turn\" just as Wisdom/Pitkin runs onto the seafront; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden's fish and chips restaurant. A blue plaque at Oldham's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860, and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries.\n\nDundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant, Edward De Gernier, in the city's Greenmarket in the 1870s.\n\nIn Edinburgh, a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar, known as \"sauce\", or more specifically as \"chippy sauce\", has great popularity; salt and vinegar is preferred in Glasgow, often prompting light-hearted debate on the merits of each option among the cities' residents who tend to find the alternative a baffling concept.\n\nThe annual National Fish & Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988. The 30th Annual Fish & Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul.\n\nIn Ireland, the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant, Giuseppe Cervi, who mistakenly stepped off a North American-bound ship at Queenstown (now Cobh) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin. He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart. He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street). His wife Palma would ask customers \"Uno di questa, uno di quella?\" This phrase (meaning \"one of this, one of that\") entered the vernacular in Dublin as \"one and one\", which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city.\n\nFish and chips is the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand. Food historians have been unable to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century, nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish-and-chip shop. As in Britain, Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish.\n\nTraditionally, fish and chips were served in wrappings of newspaper. With the decline of the newspaper industry, this has become less common.\n\nIn 1980, four up-and-coming Labour Party politicians, including David Lange, were nicknamed the \"Fish and Chip Brigade\" due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips.\n\nIn the United States, the dish is most commonly sold as \"fish and chips\", except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest, where this dish would be called a \"fish fry\". Despite the name \"fish and chips\", and the US meaning of \"chips\" as potato chips, the dish is served with french fries (much thinner than British and Irish chips). However, some restaurants will use thicker french fries which are known as \"steak fries\". These fries are closer to British chips. In the Southern United States, a common form of cuisine is fried catfish with french fries, accompanied by coleslaw, pickles, raw onion slices and lemon slices.\n\nTraditional frying uses beef dripping or lard; however, vegetable oils, such as peanut oil (used because of its relatively high smoke point) predominate. A minority of vendors in the North of England and Scotland, and the majority of vendors in Northern Ireland, still use dripping or lard, as it imparts a different flavour to the dish, but this makes the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths. Lard is used in some living industrial history museums, such as the Black Country Living Museum. All fish is filleted, no bones should be found in the fish.\n\nBritish and Irish chips are usually thicker than American-style french fries. In their homes or in some restaurants, people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip, more similar to the British and Irish variant, sometimes referred to as \"steak fries\".\n\nIn Britain and Ireland, fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour batter, adding a little sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and a little vinegar to create lightness, as they react to create bubbles in the batter. Other recipes may use beer or milk batter, where these liquids are often substitutes for water. The carbon dioxide in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter. Beer also results in an orange-brown colour. A simple beer batter might consist of a 2:3 ratio of flour to beer by volume. The type of beer alters the taste of the batter; some prefer lager whereas others use stout or bitter.\n\nIn Britain and Ireland, cod and haddock appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips, but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock or coley, plaice, skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, plaice or whiting appear most commonly in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock.\n\nIn Australia, reef cod and rock cod (a different variety from that used in the United Kingdom), barramundi or flathead (more expensive options), flake (a type of shark meat) or snapper (cheaper options), are commonly used. From the early 21st century, farmed basa imported from Vietnam and hoki have become common in Australian fish and chip shops. Other types of fish are also used based on regional availability.\n\nIn New Zealand, snapper or gurnard was originally the preferred species for battered fillets in the North Island. As catches of this fish declined, it was replaced by hoki, shark (particularly rig) – marketed as lemon fish – and tarakihi. Bluefin gurnard and blue cod predominate in South Island fish and chips.\n\nIn the United States, the type of fish used depends on availability in a given region. Some common types are cod, halibut, flounder, tilapia or, in New England, Atlantic cod or haddock. Salmon is growing common on the West Coast, while freshwater catfish is most frequently used in the Southeast.\n\nIn India, the dish is usually based on pomfret fish, and uses chilli paste, and more pepper than would be used in Britain.\n\nIn chip shops in most parts of Britain and Ireland, salt and vinegar are traditionally sprinkled over fish and chips at the time it is served. Suppliers use malt vinegar, onion vinegar (used for pickling onions), or the cheaper non-brewed condiment. In a few places, notably Edinburgh, 'sauce' (as in 'salt and sauce') is more traditional than vinegar - with 'sauce' meaning a brown sauce. In England, a portion of mushy peas is a popular side dish, as are a range of pickles that typically include gherkins, onions and eggs. In table-service restaurants and pubs, the dish is usually served with a slice of lemon for squeezing over the fish and without any sauces or condiments, with salt, vinegar and sauces available at the customer's leisure.\n\nIn Ireland, Wales and England, most takeaways serve warm side portions of sauces such as curry sauce, gravy or mushy peas. The sauces are usually poured over the chips. In some areas, this dish without fish is referred to as 'wet chips'. In the Midlands especially, chips with mushy peas or baked beans is known as a \"pea mix\" or a \"bean mix\". Other fried products include 'scraps' (also known as 'bits' in Southern England and \"scrumps\" in South Wales), originally a by-product of fish frying. Still popular in Northern England, they were given as treats to the children of customers. Portions prepared and sold today consist of loose blobs of batter, deep fried to a crunchy golden crisp in the cooking-fat. The potato scallop or potato cake consists of slices of potato dipped in fish batter and deep fried until golden brown. These are often accompanied for dipping by the warm sauces listed above.\n\nThere are distinct regional variations in how accompaniments are added to the meal where it is as a take away – related partly to whether the food is entirely wrapped in paper. In some shops the customer is expected to add these; in others the expectation is that the server does so.\n\nAn average serving of fish and chips consisting of 6 ounces (170 grams) of fried fish with 10 ounces (280 grams) of fried chips has approximately 1,000 calories and contains approximately 52 grams of fat. The use of tartar sauce as a condiment adds more calories and fat to the dish.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, fish and chips are usually sold by independent restaurants and take-aways known as fish and chip shops. Outlets range from small affairs to chain restaurants. Locally owned seafood restaurants are also popular in many places, as are mobile \"chip vans\". In Canada, the outlets may be referred to as \"chip wagons\". In the United Kingdom some shops have amusing names, such as \"A Salt and Battery\", \"The Codfather\", \"The Frying Scotsman\", \"Oh My Cod\" and \"Frying Nemo\" In New Zealand and Australia, fish-and-chip vendors are a popular business and source of income among the Asian community, particularly Chinese migrants. In Indonesia, fish and chips are commonly found in big cities like Jakarta in western and seafood restaurants, as well as chain restaurants like The Manhattan Fish Market, Fish & Chips etc.\n\nIn Ireland, the majority of traditional vendors are migrants or the descendants of migrants from southern Italy. A trade organisation exists to represent this tradition.\n\nFish and chips is a popular lunch meal eaten by families travelling to seaside resorts for day trips who do not bring their own picnic meals.\n\nFish-and-chip outlets sell roughly 25% of all the white fish consumed in the United Kingdom, and 10% of all potatoes.\n\nThe numerous competitions and awards for \"best fish-and-chip shop\" testify to the recognised status of this type of outlet in popular culture.\n\nFish-and-chip shops traditionally wrapped their product in newspaper, or with an inner layer of white paper (for hygiene) and an outer layer of newspaper or blank newsprint (for insulation and to absorb grease), though the use of newspaper for wrapping has almost ceased on grounds of hygiene. , establishments usually use food-quality wrapping paper, occasionally printed on the outside to imitate newspaper.\n\nThe British National Federation of Fish Friers was founded in 1913. It promotes fish and chips and offers training courses.\n\nA previous world record for the \"largest serving of fish and chips\" was held by Gadaleto's Seafood Market in New Paltz, New York. This 2004 record was broken by Yorkshire pub Wensleydale Heifer in July 2011. An attempt to break this record was made by Doncaster fish and chip shop Scawsby Fisheries in August 2012, which served of battered cod alongside of chips.\n\nThe long-standing Roman Catholic tradition of not eating meat on Fridays, especially during Lent, and of substituting fish for meat on that day continues to influence habits even in predominantly Protestant, Anglican, semi-secular and secular societies. Friday night remains a traditional occasion for eating fish-and-chips; and many cafeterias and similar establishments, while varying their menus on other days of the week, habitually offer fish and chips every Friday.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the words \"fish and chips\" are often used as a shibboleth to highlight the difference in each country's short-i vowel sound . Australian English has a higher forward sound , close to the \"ee\" in \"see\" (but shorter), while New Zealand English has a lower backward sound akin to the \"a\" in \"Rosa's\" (but not in \"Rosa\", which is typically lower ). Thus, New Zealanders hear Australians say \"feesh and cheeps,\" while Australians hear New Zealanders say \"fush and chups.\"\n\nIn the UK, waste oil from fish and chip shops has become a useful source of biodiesel. The German biodiesel company Petrotec has outlined plans to produce biodiesel in the UK from waste oil from the British fish-and-chip industry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46191", "title": "Tillage", "text": "Tillage\n\nTillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. \n\nTillage that is deeper and more thorough is classified as primary, and tillage that is shallower and sometimes more selective of location is secondary. Primary tillage such as ploughing tends to produce a rough surface finish, whereas secondary tillage tends to produce a smoother surface finish, such as that required to make a good seedbed for many crops. Harrowing and rototilling often combine primary and secondary tillage into one operation.\n\n\"Tillage\" can also mean the land that is tilled. The word \"cultivation\" has several senses that overlap substantially with those of \"tillage\". In a general context, both can refer to agriculture. Within agriculture, both can refer to any kind of soil agitation. Additionally, \"cultivation\" or \"cultivating\" may refer to an even narrower sense of shallow, selective secondary tillage of row crop fields that kills weeds while sparing the crop plants.\n\nTilling was first performed via human labor, sometimes involving slaves. Hoofed animals could also be used to till soil by trampling. The wooden plow was then invented. It could be pulled with human labor, or by mule, ox, elephant, water buffalo, or similar sturdy animal. Horses are generally unsuitable, though breeds such as the Clydesdale were bred as draft animals. The steel plow allowed farming in the American Midwest, where tough prairie grasses and rocks caused trouble. Soon after 1900, the farm tractor was introduced, which eventually made modern large-scale agriculture possible.\n\nPrimary Tillage is usually conducted after the last harvest, when the soil is wet enough to allow plowing but also allows good traction. Some soil types can be plowed dry. The objective of primary tillage is to attain a reasonable depth of soft soil, incorporate crop residues, kill weeds, and to aerate the soil. Secondary tillage is any subsequent tillage, in order to incorporate fertilizers, reduce the soil to a finer tilth, level the surface, or control weeds.\n\nReduced tillage leaves between 15 and 30% crop residue cover on the soil or 500 to 1000 pounds per acre (560 to 1100 kg/ha) of small grain residue during the critical erosion period. This may involve the use of a chisel plow, field cultivators, or other implements. See the general comments below to see how they can affect the amount of residue.\n\nIntensive tillage leaves less than 15% crop residue cover or less than 500 pounds per acre (560 kg/ha) of small grain residue. This type of tillage is often referred to as conventional tillage but as conservational tillage is now more widely used than intensive tillage (in the United States), it is often not appropriate to refer to this type of tillage as conventional. Intensive tillage often involves multiple operations with implements such as a mold board, disk, and/or chisel plow. Then a finisher with a harrow, rolling basket, and cutter can be used to prepare the seed bed. There are many variations.\n\nConservation tillage leaves at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface, or at least 1,000 lb/ac (1,100 kg/ha) of small grain residue on the surface during the critical soil erosion period. This slows water movement, which reduces the amount of soil erosion. Additionally, conservation tillage has been found to benefit predatory arthropods that can enhance pest control. Conservation tillage also benefits farmers by reducing fuel consumption and soil compaction. By reducing the number of times the farmer travels over the field, farmers realize significant savings in fuel and labor. In most years since 1997, conservation tillage was used in US cropland more than intensive or reduced tillage.\n\nHowever, conservation tillage delays warming of the soil due to the reduction of dark earth exposure to the warmth of the spring sun, thus delaying the planting of the next year's spring crop of corn.\n\n\nZone tillage is form of modified deep tillage in which only narrow strips are tilled, leaving soil in between the rows untilled. This type of tillage agitates the soil to help reduce soil compaction problems and to improve internal soil drainage. It is designed to only disrupt the soil in a narrow strip directly below the crop row. In comparison to no-till, which relies on the previous year’s plant residue to protect the soil and aides in postponement of the warming of the soil and crop growth in Northern climates, zone tillage creates approximately a 5-inch-wide strip that simultaneously breaks up plow pans, assists in warming the soil and helps to prepare a seedbed. When combined with cover crops, zone tillage helps replace lost organic matter, slows the deterioration of the soil, improves soil drainage, increases soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and allows necessary soil organisms to survive.\n\nIt has been successfully used on farms in the mid-west and west for over 40 years and is currently used on more than 36% of the U.S. farmland. Some specific states where zone tillage is currently in practice are Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Illinois.\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't consistent yield results in the Northern Cornbelt states; however, there is still interest in deep tillage within the agriculture industry. In areas that are not well-drained, deep tillage may be used as an alternative to installing more expensive tile drainage.\n\nPlowing:\n\n\n\n\"Primary tillage\" loosens the soil and mixes in fertilizer and/or plant material, resulting in soil with a rough texture.\n\n\"Secondary tillage\" produces finer soil and sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the seed bed. It also provides weed control throughout the growing season during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving herbicides.\n\nModern agricultural science has greatly reduced the use of tillage. Crops can be grown for several years without any tillage through the use of herbicides to control weeds, crop varieties that tolerate packed soil, and equipment that can plant seeds or fumigate the soil without really digging it up. This practice, called no-till farming, reduces costs and environmental change by reducing soil erosion and diesel fuel usage.\n\nSite preparation is any of various treatments applied to a site in order to ready it for seeding or planting. The purpose is to facilitate the regeneration of that site by the chosen method. Site preparation may be designed to achieve, singly or in any combination: improved access, by reducing or rearranging slash, and amelioration of adverse forest floor, soil, vegetation, or other biotic factors. Site preparation is undertaken to ameliorate one or more constraints that would otherwise be likely to thwart the objectives of management. A valuable bibliography on the effects of soil temperature and site preparation on subalpine and boreal tree species has been prepared by McKinnon et al. (2002).\n\nSite preparation is the work that is done before a forest area is regenerated. Some types of site preparation are burning.\n\nBroadcast burning is commonly used to prepare clearcut sites for planting, e.g., in central British Columbia, and in the temperate region of North America generally.\n\nPrescribed burning is carried out primarily for slash hazard reduction and to improve site conditions for regeneration; all or some of the following benefits may accrue:\n\nPrescribed burning for preparing sites for direct seeding was tried on a few occasions in Ontario, but none of the burns was hot enough to produce a seedbed that was adequate without supplementary mechanical site preparation.\n\nChanges in soil chemical properties associated with burning include significantly increased pH, which Macadam (1987) in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone of central British Columbia found persisting more than a year after the burn. Average fuel consumption was 20 to 24 t/ha and the forest floor depth was reduced by 28% to 36%. The increases correlated well with the amounts of slash (both total and ≥7 cm diameter) consumed. The change in pH depends on the severity of the burn and the amount consumed; the increase can be as much as 2 units, a 100-fold change. Deficiencies of copper and iron in the foliage of white spruce on burned clearcuts in central British Columbia might be attributable to elevated pH levels.\n\nEven a broadcast slash fire in a clearcut does not give a uniform burn over the whole area. Tarrant (1954), for instance, found only 4% of a 140-ha slash burn had burned severely, 47% had burned lightly, and 49% was unburned. Burning after windrowing obviously accentuates the subsequent heterogeneity.\n\nMarked increases in exchangeable calcium also correlated with the amount of slash at least 7 cm in diameter consumed. Phosphorus availability also increased, both in the forest floor and in the 0 cm to 15 cm mineral soil layer, and the increase was still evident, albeit somewhat diminished, 21 months after burning. However, in another study in the same Sub-boreal Spruce Zone found that although it increased immediately after the burn, phosphorus availability had dropped to below pre-burn levels within 9 months.\n\nNitrogen will be lost from the site by burning, though concentrations in remaining forest floor were found by Macadam (1987) to have increased in 2 of 6 plots, the others showing decreases. Nutrient losses may be outweighed, at least in the short term, by improved soil microclimate through the reduced thickness of forest floor where low soil temperatures are a limiting factor.\n\nThe \"Picea/Abies\" forests of the Alberta foothills are often characterized by deep accumulations of organic matter on the soil surface and cold soil temperatures, both of which make reforestation difficult and result in a general deterioration in site productivity; Endean and Johnstone (1974) describe experiments to test prescribed burning as a means of seedbed preparation and site amelioration on representative clear-felled \"Picea/Abies\" areas. Results showed that, in general, prescribed burning did not reduce organic layers satisfactorily, nor did it increase soil temperature, on the sites tested. Increases in seedling establishment, survival, and growth on the burned sites were probably the result of slight reductions in the depth of the organic layer, minor increases in soil temperature, and marked improvements in the efficiency of the planting crews. Results also suggested that the process of site deterioration has not been reversed by the burning treatments applied.\n\nSlash weight (the oven-dry weight of the entire crown and that portion of the stem < 4 inches in diameter) and size distribution are major factors influencing the forest fire hazard on harvested sites. Forest managers interested in the application of prescribed burning for hazard reduction and silviculture, were shown a method for quantifying the slash load by Kiil (1968). In west-central Alberta, he felled, measured, and weighed 60 white spruce, graphed (a) slash weight per merchantable unit volume against diameter at breast height (dbh), and (b) weight of fine slash (<1.27 cm) also against dbh, and produced a table of slash weight and size distribution on one acre of a hypothetical stand of white spruce. When the diameter distribution of a stand is unknown, an estimate of slash weight and size distribution can be obtained from average stand diameter, number of trees per unit area, and merchantable cubic foot volume. The sample trees in Kiil's study had full symmetrical crowns. Densely growing trees with short and often irregular crowns would probably be overestimated; open-grown trees with long crowns would probably be underestimated.\n\nThe need to provide shade for young outplants of Engelmann spruce in the high Rocky Mountains is emphasized by the U.S. Forest Service. Acceptable planting spots are defined as microsites on the north and east sides of down logs, stumps, or slash, and lying in the shadow cast by such material. Where the objectives of management specify more uniform spacing, or higher densities, than obtainable from an existing distribution of shade-providing material, redistribution or importing of such material has been undertaken.\n\nSite preparation on some sites might be done simply to facilitate access by planters, or to improve access and increase the number or distribution of microsites suitable for planting or seeding.\n\nWang et al. (2000) determined field performance of white and black spruces 8 and 9 years after outplanting on boreal mixedwood sites following site preparation (Donaren disc trenching versus no trenching) in 2 plantation types (open versus sheltered) in southeastern Manitoba. Donaren trenching slightly reduced the mortality of black spruce but significantly increased the mortality of white spruce. Significant difference in height was found between open and sheltered plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce, and root collar diameter in sheltered plantations was significantly larger than in open plantations for black spruce but not for white spruce. Black spruce open plantation had significantly smaller volume (97 cm³) compared with black spruce sheltered (210 cm³), as well as white spruce open (175 cm³) and sheltered (229 cm³) plantations. White spruce open plantations also had smaller volume than white spruce sheltered plantations. For transplant stock, strip plantations had a significantly higher volume (329 cm³) than open plantations (204 cm³). Wang et al. (2000) recommended that sheltered plantation site preparation should be used.\n\nUp to 1970, no \"sophisticated\" site preparation equipment had become operational in Ontario, but the need for more efficacious and versatile equipment was increasingly recognized. By this time, improvements were being made to equipment originally developed by field staff, and field testing of equipment from other sources was increasing.\n\nAccording to J. Hall (1970), in Ontario at least, the most widely used site preparation technique was post-harvest mechanical scarification by equipment front-mounted on a bulldozer (blade, rake, V-plow, or teeth), or dragged behind a tractor (Imsett or S.F.I. scarifier, or rolling chopper). Drag type units designed and constructed by Ontario's Department of Lands and Forests used anchor chain or tractor pads separately or in combination, or were finned steel drums or barrels of various sizes and used in sets alone or combined with tractor pad or anchor chain units.\n\nJ. Hall's (1970) report on the state of site preparation in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine–spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been \"quite successful\" for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.\n\nSite preparation treatments that create raised planting spots have commonly improved outplant performance on sites subject to low soil temperature and excess soil moisture. Mounding can certainly have a big influence on soil temperature. Draper et al. (1985), for instance, documented this as well as the effect it had on root growth of outplants (Table 30).\n\nThe mounds warmed up quickest, and at soil depths of 0.5 cm and 10 cm averaged 10 and 7 °C higher, respectively, than in the control. On sunny days, daytime surface temperature maxima on the mound and organic mat reached 25 °C to 60 °C, depending on soil wetness and shading. Mounds reached mean soil temperatures of 10 °C at 10 cm depth 5 days after planting, but the control did not reach that temperature until 58 days after planting. During the first growing season, mounds had 3 times as many days with a mean soil temperature greater than 10 °C than did the control microsites.\n\nDraper et al.'s (1985) mounds received 5 times the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.\n\nWith linear site preparation, orientation is sometimes dictated by topography or other considerations, but the orientation can often be chosen. It can make a difference. A disk-trenching experiment in the Sub-boreal Spruce Zone in interior British Columbia investigated the effect on growth of young outplants (lodgepole pine) in 13 microsite planting positions: berm, hinge, and trench in each of north, south, east, and west aspects, as well as in untreated locations between the furrows. Tenth-year stem volumes of trees on south, east, and west-facing microsites were significantly greater than those of trees on north-facing and untreated microsites. However, planting spot selection was seen to be more important overall than trench orientation.\n\nIn a Minnesota study, the N–S strips accumulated more snow but snow melted faster than on E–W strips in the first year after felling. Snow-melt was faster on strips near the centre of the strip-felled area than on border strips adjoining the intact stand. The strips, 50 feet (15.24 m) wide, alternating with uncut strips 16 feet (4.88 m) wide, were felled in a \"Pinus resinosa\" stand, aged 90 to 100 years.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46316", "title": "Chowder", "text": "Chowder\n\nChowder is a type of soup or stew often prepared with milk or cream and thickened with broken crackers, crushed ship biscuit, or a roux. Variations of chowder can be seafood or vegetable. Crackers such as oyster crackers or saltines may accompany chowders as a side item, and cracker pieces may be dropped atop the dish. New England clam chowder is typically made with chopped clams and diced potatoes, in a mixed cream and milk base, often with a small amount of butter. Other common chowders include seafood chowder, which includes fish, clams, and many other types of shellfish; corn chowder, which uses corn instead of clams; a wide variety of fish chowders; and potato chowder, which is often made with cheese. Fish chowder, corn chowder, and clam chowder are especially popular in the North American regions of New England and Atlantic Canada.\n\nThe origin of the term \"chowder\" is obscure. One possible source is the French word \"chaudron\", the French word for cauldron, the type of cooking or heating stove on which the first chowders were probably cooked. \"Chodier\" was also a name for a cooking pot in the Creole language of the French Caribbean islands: \"Crab pas mache, li pas gras; li mache touop, et li tomber nans chodier\" (\"if a crab don't walk, he don't get fat, if he walks too much, he falls into a cooking pot\"). Note also the Portuguese, Brazilian, Galician and Basque fish and shellfish stew known as \"caldeirada\" which would appear to have a similar etymology. Another possible source of the word \"chowder\" could be the French dish called \"chaudrée\" (sometimes spelled \"chauderée\"), which is a type of thick fish soup from the coastal regions of Charente-Maritime and Vendée. Yet another etymology could be from Quebecois French, where \"chaudière\" means \"bucket\".\n\nAlthough in the sixteenth century in Cornwall and Devon a dialect word \"jowter\" was used to describe hawkers, particularly fish-sellers, with later variants \"chowder\" and \"chowter\", this is not cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as a possible source. The earliest citation the OED gives for the word used in its current sense of a fish-based stew is American. Other usage which attests to its use in England in the middle of 18th century is in a novel by Tobias Smollett in which one of the characters states, \"My head sings and simmers like a pot of chowder\". A Manx sailor in his memoirs refers to a meal made aboard a British ship on a voyage through the Caribbean in 1786: \"...we frequently served up a mess called \"chowder\", consisting of a mixture of fresh fish, salt pork, pounded biscuit and onions; and which, when well seasoned and stewed, we found to be an excellent palatable dish.\" Cookbooks of the period included recipes for \"Chowder, a Sea Dish\". In 1830 an English baked dish made with salmon and potato was called a chowder.\n\nIn Merriam-Webster's dictionary chowder is defined as \"a thick soup or stew made of seafood or corn with potatoes and onions and milk or tomatoes\".\n\nChowder as it is known today originated as a shipboard dish, and was thickened with the use of hardtack. Chowder was brought to North America with immigrants from England and France and seafarers more than 250 years ago and became popular as a delicious dish, and is now a widely used dish as it is simple to prepare.\n\nIn 1890, in the magazine \"American Notes and Queries\", it was said that the dish was of French origin. Among French settlers in Canada it was a custom to stew clams and fish laid in courses with bacon, sea biscuits, and other ingredients in a bucket called a \"chaudière\", and it thus came to be invented. Then the Native Americans adopted it as \"chawder\", which was then corrupted as \"chowder\" by the Yankees.\n\nIn the United States, early chowder making is traced to New England. It was a bowl of simmering chowder by the sea side that provided in its basic form \"sustenance of body and mind – a marker of hearth and home, community, family and culture\". It is a food which evolved along the coastal shoreline of New England as a \"congerie\" of simple things, very basic and cooked simply. It is a simple dish of salt and pepper, potatoes and onion, pork and fish, cream and hard crackers, and not a sophisticated dish of the elite. Its simplicity made it attractive and it became a regional dish of the New Englanders, and their favorite recipe was \"chowder master\". \"Symbolically, functionally, mnemonically or dynamically\" chowder has become a powerful means for New Englanders to define themselves as a community, a rich community with a deep past and value that distinguishes their region from all others. The dish has been made there for a long time and is imbibed into the community culture. Etta M. Madden and Martha L. Finch observe that chowder provides \"visceral memories that provided feelings of familiarity, comfort and continuity\".\n\nA recipe formulated and published in 1894 by Charles Ranhofer, a famous chef of Delmonico's restaurant, was called \"Chowder de Lucines\" and had ingredients of pork, clams, potato (sliced to a seven sixteenths-inch size), onion, parsley, tomato, crackers garnished by thyme, salt and pepper. Others in the same family, totally different from the New England clam chowder, are: \"Fulton Market style\", introduced in 1904 and made from clams, tomatoes, allspice, cloves, red pepper, and Worcester sauce; a \"Vegetable Clam Chowder\" introduced in 1929 and made of clams, chopped onions, diced carrots, stewed tomatoes, and thyme; \"Coney Island Clam Chowder\"; \"New York Clam Chowder\"; and \"Manhattan Clam Chowder\", a late entry after 1930.\n\nChowder is a soup with cream or milk mixed with ingredients such as potatoes, sweet corn, smoked haddock, clams and prawns, etc. Some cream-style chowders do not use cream, and are instead prepared using milk and a roux to thicken them. Some of the popular variations are clam chowder and potatoes; seafood chowder; spiced haddock chowder; Irish fish chowder with soda bread; crayfish chowder; clam chowder with cod; British seaside chowder with saffron; thick smoked-haddock chowder; Raymond Blanc's light shellfish chowder; New England-style clam chowder with crunchy thyme breadcrumbs; smoked haddock chowder with leeks and sweetcorn; clam, broad bean and salami chowder; and many more. Chowder can be a comfort food, especially during the winter months.\n\nConsidered a national dish of Bermuda, the primary ingredients in Bermuda fish chowder include fish, tomato, and onion that is seasoned with black rum and a Sherry pepper sauce. The dish is of British origin, and was brought to the New World by the colonists.\n\nClam chowder is prepared with clams, diced potato, onion, and sometimes celery. It may be prepared as a cream-style or broth-style soup. Several variations of clam chowder exist, including New England clam chowder, which is a cream-style soup; Manhattan clam chowder, a broth-style soup prepared using tomato, vegetables and clams; Rhode Island clam chowder, a broth-style soup prepared using tomato and clams with no vegetables, and alternatively a simple broth-style soup using clams; New Jersey clam chowder; Delaware clam chowder; Hatteras clam chowder; and Minorcan clam chowder. In Connecticut clam chowder, milk is used instead of cream. New England clam chowder is made in a diverse variety of styles.\n\nClam chowder may be prepared with fresh, steamed clams or canned clams. The \"clam liquor\" from steamed or canned clams may be retained for use in the soup, and fresh or bottled clam juice may be used. 21 January is the National New England Clam Chowder Day.\n\nIn the late 1800s clam chowder was introduced in New Zealand as an \"American\" dish and has become integral to New Zealand cuisine. A variant of New Zealand clam chowder is \"pipi chowder\", also known as \"pipi soup\" made with New Zealand surf clams. \"Pipi\" comes from the indigenous Maori name for the shellfish. Despite strong historical ties between New Zealand and Australia clam chowder is virtually unheard of in Australia and absent from Australian restaurant menus.\n\nCorn chowder is similar in consistency to New England clam chowder, with corn being used instead of clams. Additional vegetables that may be used in its preparation include potatoes, celery and onion. Some are prepared using bacon as an ingredient. Corn chowder may be prepared with fresh, frozen, or canned corn.\n\nFish chowder is prepared with fish such as salmon or cod, and is similar to clam chowder in ingredients and texture. Ingredients used in fish chowder may include potato, onion, celery, carrot, corn and bacon.\n\nSouthern Illinois Chowder, also referred to as \"downtown chowder\", is a thick stew or soup that is very different from the New England and Manhattan chowders. The main ingredients are beef, chicken, tomatoes, cabbage, lima beans, and green beans. Traditionally, squirrel meat was a common addition. Southern Illinois chowder is a hearty dish that has been described as being closer in style to burgoo and Brunswick stew than coastal chowders.\n\nSeafood chowder is prepared with various types of seafood as a primary ingredient, and may be prepared as a broth- or cream-style chowder. It is a popular menu item in New Zealand using ready-prepared mixed seafood, called \"seafood marinara,\" \"marinara mix\", or simply \"marinara.\" Each of these terms are unique to New Zealand and Australia.\n\nSpiced haddock chowder is made with haddock fillets, carrot, potato, plain flour, bay leaves, peppercorns, mustard, and spices added to milk and cooked in a pot with butter.\n\nThe White Castle restaurant serves a potato and bacon chowder.\n\nIn North America, as people moved west, some homemade preparations of traditional chowder used canned or bottled clams when fresh clams were not available. In some places the ingredients were modified based upon other locally available foods such as salmon, corn and chicken.\n\nMass-produced, canned varieties of chowder are manufactured and purveyed to consumers, such as Campbell's and Progresso's New England Clam Chowder, among other brands.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46318", "title": "Portable soup", "text": "Portable soup\n\nPortable soup was a kind of dehydrated food used in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a precursor of meat extract and bouillon cubes, and of industrially dehydrated food. It is also known as pocket soup or veal glew. It is a cousin of the \"glace de viande\" of French cooking. It was long a staple of seamen and explorers, for it would keep for many months or even years. In this context, it was a filling and nutritious dish. Portable soup of less extended vintage was, according to the 1881 \"Household Cyclopedia\",\n\"exceedingly convenient for private families, for by putting one of the cakes in a saucepan with about a quart of water, and a little salt, a basin of good broth may be made in a few minutes.\"\n\nSoup was made in the usual way, reduced, degreased—or the fat would go rancid—and then reduced repeatedly until it took on the consistency of jelly. Once it was sufficiently gelatinous to hold its form, it was placed on pieces of flannel or unglazed earthenware dishes and rotated regularly to dry it further. This was a seasonal process attempted only in the winter when humidity was low. Once dry, it was wrapped in paper and stored in boxes.\n\nPortable soup is generally held to have been invented by Mrs Dubois, a London tavern keeper who, with William Cookworthy, won a contract to manufacture it for the Royal Navy in 1756. It had, however, been described at a much earlier date. In the late sixteenth century, Sir Hugh Plat wrote, in his unpublished notes, of portable soup as a potential military rations for the army and navy, describing it as meat broth boiled down to a thick and dry paste which he called \"Gelly\". Plat's basic recipe was to boil the feet or legs of beef cattle for a long time to make \"a good broath\" which was then strained and boiled down to \"a strong & stiff gelly\". This in turn was dried on clean cloths in a windy place out of the sun, cut with wire into pieces, powdered with flour to stop the pieces from sticking, and stored in wooden boxes. Made in March, it would \"keepe all the yeere\". Alternatively, the dry jelly could be \"stamped\" into shape with a wooden die, like the \"Genoa Paste\" of quinces familiar to Plat and other cooks of the time. He instructed that no sugar or salt should be added to the jelly because such taste would be concentrated by the boiling process, although he speculated that saffron might add colour, and that rosewater could also be added at this stage. He wondered whether baked flour or grated bread could be incorporated to make the jelly \"serve as bread and meate the better\", and whether the addition of isinglass would make it stiffer. The jelly was variously described by Plat as a \"Victual for Warr\", \"dry gelly carried to the sea\", and a food for soldiers on the march. Plat envisaged using this jelly either as the base for soup, or \"neat\" as a concentrated food. Reconstitution as soup simply involved dissolving a piece of the jelly in hot water to make \"good broath\", and, because jelly and water alone would be rather bland, adding such flavourings as were available or to taste – sugar, salt, liquorice, aniseed, or other \"convenient spice\". Plat emphasised the utility of the jelly as field rations, for \"a soldier may satisfie his hunger herwith, whilst hee is in his march\". He recommended that a leg of beef or veal be boiled with every 6 or 8 neats' (cows') feet to produce a jelly which would more easily dissolve in the mouth.\n\nThe existence of portable soups (called \"bouillons en tablettes\" in French) is mentioned, in 1690, in Antoine Furetière's \"Dictionnaire universel\", under the article \"Tablette\": \"On a vue des consommés reduits en tablettes, ou des bouillons à porter en poche.\" (\"We have seen consommés reduced into tablets, or broth to carry in your pocket.\")\n\nMrs Dubois was described as \"a person of good character and circumstances\". She operated from a tavern, at the Golden Head, in Three Kings Court in Fleet Street. She may have been the widow of a French chef and tavern keeper; but, by 1757, she had a new husband, Edward Bennet, son of a Sheffield knife-grinder. The contract with the navy was alluded to in advertising material long after it had lapsed, Benjamin Piper, successor in the business announced he was \"Successor to Messieurs Bennet and Dubois, The original Portable Soup-Makers to His majesty’s Royal Navy\" and one Vigor, successor to Piper, used the same rubric on his flyers. The naval authorities hoped that portable soup would prevent scurvy among their crews. They therefore allotted a daily ration to each sailor beginning in the 1750s. Captain Cook was convinced of its efficacy and carried it on both his South Seas voyages.\n\nLewis and Clark carried portable soup on their 1804–1806 expedition into the territory of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. According to his letter from Fredericktown, Ohio, on April 15, 1803, Lewis purchased the soup from Francois Baillet, a cook in Philadelphia. He paid $289.50 for the 193 pounds of portable soup stored in \"32 canisters\". Lewis carried it with him overland to the embarkation point on the Ohio River.\n\nHowever, by 1815, with the publication of physician Gilbert Blane's \"On the Comparative Health of the British Navy from 1779 to 1814\", the efficacy of portable soup for promoting the health of sailors was found lacking. Opinion shifted in favor of canned meats, by a process invented in France in 1806.\n\nA similar product, portable gelatin, was developed by American inventor Peter Cooper in 1845, as a staple meal or dessert for families.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46360", "title": "Sashimi", "text": "Sashimi\n\nSashimi (; , ) is a Japanese delicacy consisting of very fresh raw fish or meat sliced into thin pieces and often eaten with soy sauce.\n\nThe word \"sashimi\" means \"pierced body\", i.e. \"刺身\" = \"sashimi\", where 刺し = \"sashi\" (pierced, stuck) and 身 = \"mi\" (body, meat). This word dates from the Muromachi period, and was possibly coined when the word \"切る\" = \"kiru\" (cut), the culinary step, was considered too inauspicious to be used by anyone other than samurai. This word may derive from the culinary practice of sticking the fish's tail and fin to the slices for the purpose of identifying the fish being eaten.\n\nAnother possibility for the name could come from the traditional method of harvesting. \"Sashimi-grade\" fish is caught by individual handline. As soon as the fish is landed, its brain is pierced with a sharp spike, and it is placed in slurried ice. This spiking is called the ikejime process, and the instantaneous death means that the fish's flesh contains a minimal amount of lactic acid. This means that the fish will keep fresh on ice for about ten days, without turning white or otherwise degrading.\n\nMany non-Japanese use the terms sashimi and sushi interchangeably, but the two dishes are distinct and separate. Sushi refers to any dish made with vinegared rice. While raw fish is one traditional sushi ingredient, many sushi dishes contain seafood that has been cooked, and others have no seafood at all.\n\nSashimi is often the first course in a formal Japanese meal, but it can also be the main course, presented with rice and miso soup in separate bowls. Japanese chefs consider sashimi the finest dish in Japanese formal dining and recommend that it be eaten before other strong flavors affect the palate.\n\nThe sliced seafood that composes the main ingredient is typically draped over a garnish. The typical garnish is Asian white radish, \"daikon\", shredded into long thin strands, or single leaves of the shiso (perilla) herb.\n\nSashimi is popularly served with a dipping sauce (soy sauce) and condiments such as wasabi paste, grated fresh ginger, grated fresh garlic, or ponzu for meat sashimi, and such garnishes as shiso and shredded daikon radish. \nWasabi paste is sometimes mixed directly into soy sauce as a dipping sauce, which is generally not done when eating sushi. Another way to flavor soy sauce with wasabi is to place the wasabi mound into the soy sauce dish and then pour it in. This allows the wasabi to infuse the soy sauce more subtly. A reputed motivation for serving wasabi with sashimi (and also \"gari\", pickled ginger), besides its flavor, is killing harmful bacteria and parasites that could be present in raw seafood. Other garnishes, more common in Japan than overseas, include red water pepper sprouts and a small chrysanthemum . The chrysanthemum, unlike other garnishes, is not intended to be eaten, and in cheap service (such as at supermarkets) may be substituted with a plastic flower.\n\nTo highlight the fish's appearance, the chef cuts it into different thicknesses. The hira-zukuri cut, which translates into \"rectangular slice\", is the standard cut for most sashimi. Typically this style of cut is the size of a domino and thick. Tuna, salmon, and kingfish are most commonly cut in this style. The usu-zukuri cut, which translates to \"thin slice\", is an extremely thin, diagonally cut slice that is mostly used to cut firm fish, such as bream, whiting, and flounder. The dimensions of this fish is usually long and wide. The kaku-zukuri cut, which translates to \"square slice\", is the style in which sashimi is cut into small, thick cubes that are on each side. The ito-zukuri cut, which translates into \"thread slice,\" is the style in which the fish is cut into thin sheets, less than thick. The fish typically cut with the ito-zukuri style include garfish and squid.\n\n \nThe most popular main ingredients for sashimi includes:\n\nSome sashimi ingredients, such as octopus, are sometimes served cooked given its chewy nature. Most seafood, such as tuna, salmon, and squid, are served raw.\n\n\"Tataki\" (たたき or 叩き, \"pounded\") is a type of sashimi. It is quickly and lightly seared on the outside, leaving it raw inside.\n\nLess common, but not unusual, sashimi ingredients are vegetarian items, such as yuba (bean curd skin), and raw red meats, such as beef (known as \"gyuunotataki)\" or horse (known as \"basashi)\". Chicken \"sashimi\" (known as \"toriwasa)\" is considered by some to be a delicacy; the Nagoya kōchin, French \"poulet de Bresse\" and its American derivative, the blue foot chicken, are favored by many for this purpose, as, besides their taste, they are certified to be free of \"Salmonella\". Chicken sashimi is sometimes slightly braised on the outside.\n\nAs a raw food, consuming sashimi can result in foodborne illness when bacteria or parasites are present; for example, anisakiasis is a disease caused by the accidental ingestion of larval nematodes in the family Anisakidae, primarily \"Anisakis simplex\" but also \"Pseudoterranova decipiens\". In addition, incorrectly prepared Fugu fish may contain tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin.\n\nAnother type of food borne illness that could occur after consuming tainted sashimi is Diphyllobothriasis. This disease is an infection within the intestines that occurs when the tapeworm \"Diphyllobothrium latum\" is consumed. Common fish such as trout, salmon, pike, and sea bass harbor this parasitic larvae in their muscles. Due to the new innovation of the chilled transport system paired with the salmon and trout consumption, an increasing number of cases have been recorded annually in northern Japan due to the spread of this disease.\n\nTraditionally, fish that spend at least part of their lives in brackish or fresh water were considered unsuitable for sashimi because of the possibility of parasites. For example, salmon, an anadromous fish, is not traditionally eaten straight out of the river. A study in Seattle, Washington, showed that all wild salmon had roundworm larvae capable of infecting people, while farm-raised salmon did not have any roundworm larvae. However a study commissioned by the Pew Foundation found that total organic contaminants were consistently and significantly more concentrated in the farmed salmon as a group than in wild salmon.\n\nFreezing is often used to kill parasites. According to European Union regulations, freezing fish at −20 °C (−4 °F) for 24 hours kills parasites. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends freezing at −35 °C (−31 °F) for 15 hours, or at −20 °C (−4 °F) for 7 days.\n\nWhile Canada does not federally regulate freezing fish, British Columbia and Alberta voluntarily adhere to guidelines similar to the FDA's. Ontario attempted to legislate freezing as part of raw food handling requirements, though this was soon withdrawn due to protests by the industry that the subtle flavors and texture of raw fish would be destroyed by freezing. Instead, Ontario has decided to consider regulations on how raw fish must be handled prior to serving.\n\nSome fish for sashimi are treated with carbon monoxide to keep the flesh red for a longer time in storage. This practice can make spoiled fish appear fresh.\n\nThe increased popularity of bluefin tuna for sashimi is reported to have brought this popular species to the verge of extinction. The popularity has grown so much that the biomass of bluefin tuna has dropped from 600 metric tonnes to 200 metric tonnes from 1955 to 2000. This has resulted in a long period of depressed abundance of bluefin tuna, which has led to a failure of bluefins being able to reproduce a large amount of offspring. With the constant amount of fishing, bluefin tuna population rates have been steadily declining. A proposed solution has been farming bluefin tuna in fisheries, but this poses a problem in that the captive fish are not raised from spawn, but rather from small wild fish that are netted and transported to the farms, mostly in the Mediterranean; however, Japanese scientists have found a way to successfully breed and raise the fish entirely in captivity. Despite this technical accomplishment, this may not lead to a viable solution to maintain a sustainable bluefin population, because chefs and consumers see wild bluefin to be more appetizing, and look down upon farmed bluefin.\n\n"}
{"id": "46415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46415", "title": "Crayon", "text": "Crayon\n\nA crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of colored wax, charcoal, chalk or other material used for writing or drawing. A crayon made of pigment with a dry binder is a pastel; when made of oiled chalk, it is called an oil pastel. A grease pencil or Chinese marker (UK chinagraph pencil) is made of colored hardened grease. There are also watercolor crayons, sometimes called water-soluble crayons.\n\nCrayons are available at a range of prices and are easy to work with. They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically nontoxic, and available in a wide variety of colors. These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.\n\nIn the modern English-speaking world, the term crayon is commonly associated with the standard wax crayon, such as those widely available for use by children. Such crayons are usually approximately in length and made mostly of paraffin wax. Paraffin wax is heated and cooled to achieve the correct temperature at which a usable wax substance can be dyed and then manufactured and shipped for use around the world. Paraffin waxes are used for cosmetics, candles, for the preparation of printing ink, fruit preserving, in the pharmaceutical industry, for lubricating purposes, and crayons.\n\nColin Snedeker, a chemist for Binney & Smith (the then-parent company of Crayola), developed the first washable crayons in response to consumer complaints regarding stained fabrics and walls. A patent for the washable solid marking composition utilized in the washable crayons was awarded to Snedeker in 1990.\n\nThe history of the crayon is not entirely clear. The word \"crayon\" dates to 1644, coming from the French word \"craie\" (chalk) and the Latin word \"creta\" (Earth).\n\nThe notion to combine a form of wax with pigment actually goes back thousands of years. Encaustic painting is a technique that uses hot beeswax combined with colored pigment to bind color into stone. A heat source was then used to \"burn in\" and fix the image in place. Pliny the Elder, a Roman scholar, was thought to describe the first techniques of wax crayon drawings.\n\nThis method, employed by the Egyptians, Romans, Greeks and even indigenous people in the Philippines, is still used today. However, the process wasn't used to make crayons into a form intended to be held and colored with and was therefore ineffective to use in a classroom or as crafts for children.\n\nContemporary crayons are purported to have originated in Europe, where some of the first cylinder-shaped crayons were made with charcoal and oil. Pastels are an art medium having roots with the modern crayon and stem back to Leonardo da Vinci in 1495. Conté crayons, out of Paris, are a hybrid between a pastel and a conventional crayon, used since the late 1790s as a drawing crayon for artists. Later, various hues of powdered pigment eventually replaced the primary charcoal ingredient found in most early 19th century products. References to crayons in literature appear as early as 1813 in Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\". Joseph Lemercier (born in Paris 1803—died 1884), considered by some of his contemporaries to be \"the soul of lithography\", was also one of the founders of the modern crayon. Through his Paris business circa 1828 he produced a variety of crayon and color related products. But even as those in Europe were discovering that substituting wax for the oil strengthened the crayon, various efforts in the United States were also developing.\n\nThe initial era of wax crayons saw a number of companies and products competing for the lucrative education and artist markets. In addition to the giants such as Binney & Smith/Crayola and American Crayon/Dixon Ticonderoga, other companies popped up in the industry at various times from the late 19th century to the early 1910s.\n\nCrayola (formerly named Binney & Smith) developed their line of wax crayons beginning on June 10, 1903. Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith had been long established in the coloring marketplace through Binney's Peekskill, NY chemical works factory making lampblack by burning whale and carbon black and later instrumental in the coloring of automobile tires. In 1902 they developed and introduced the Staonal marking crayon. Edwin Binney, working with his wife, Alice Stead Binney, who coined the name Crayola by combining the French word for chalk, \"craie\", with the first part of \"oleaginous\", the oily paraffin wax used to make the crayon.\n\nBinney and Smith were quick to capitalize on their creation by offering 19 boxes with 30 colors, including the Crayola No 51, which, with 28, featured their largest selection of colors. The Rubens Crayola line started in 1903 as well (not in the 1920s as previously documented by many sources) was for artists and designed to compete with the Raphael brand of crayons from Europe. Rubens were featured in everything from the small 6-color box to the No. 500 with 24 colors. They also made many other crayon lines including Anti-Roll, Arista, Art-Toy, Besco, Boston, Cerata, Cerola, Chic'ago, Doo Zee, Durel, Easy-Off, Gotham, Liquitex, Munsell Crayola, Perma, Pooh, Protfolio, Rubens, Spectra, Tiny Tots, Washable and Widstrok.\n\nBy far the most recognizable brand was their Crayola \"Gold Medal\" line in the familiar yellow boxes. The Gold Medal referred to one the company earned with their An-du-Septic dustless chalk during the March 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Over 39,000 awards were given out using the medals designed by Adolph A. Weinman. Receiving a medal at an Exposition was and still is something of importance with many companies featuring their medal on their products. Two companies to use the 1904 medal were Jack Daniel's whiskey (which still use it on their bottles) and Binney & Smith. They used the award to design a new line of crayons featuring the medal on the front of their box. Initially, they developed and introduced the No. 8 box of eight assorted colors (this famous box is usually depicted on most historical material associated with Crayola; it was even featured on a postage stamp) in early 1905 using the side of the medal depicting an Eagle but quickly changed to the other side showing the 1904 date their medal was won. From there they began to phase out other Crayola crayon boxes until their line of Crayola crayons featured the Gold Medal design. They would use this design to identify their brand for over 50 years, permanently infusing their crayons into the consciousness of consumers and catapulting the Crayola brand into the world's leading crayon brand. The Crayola brand is owned by Hallmark Cards of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nOne of the first companies to offer up a line of wax crayons aimed for kindergarten use. Located out of New York, NY, it is unclear when this company started producing crayons but based on a known ad from 1881, they clearly offered wax crayons in boxes of 6, 12, and 18 colors. \n\nThe Franklin Mfg. Co, founded in 1876 in Rochester, New York, was one of the first companies to make and sell wax crayons. While it is undetermined when the company began manufacturing wax crayons, they were indeed selling them as early as 1883, having appeared with a display of crayons at the World's Colombian Exposition that year. They regularly advertised their Rainbow, Radiant, Penguin and Educational brands of crayons in various art and educational catalogues and periodicals throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1906, they changed their name from the Franklin Mfg. Co to the Franklin Crayon Company and remained in operation until 1927.\n\nThe Eberhard Faber Pencil Company, originally the A. W. Faber Company, was founded by John Eberhard Faber (1822–1879) in 1861. The company is primarily credited with bringing German lead pencil-making techniques to the United States. The Faber family was known for lead pencil manufacturing in the village of Stein, Germany, near the city of Nuremberg as early as 1761 when the business was founded by Kasper Faber. His son Anton Faber took over in 1774 and the company came to be known as the A.W. Faber Company. Anton's grandson, Johann Lothar, took charge of the business in 1839.\n\nJohann Lothar's youngest son, Eberhard Faber (1822–1879), came to the United States in 1848. He settled in New York City, and by 1850, had opened a store selling pencils and other stationery items in Manhattan. In 1861, Faber opened the American manufacturing branch of A.W. Faber, in a factory close to the East River, near 42nd Street (Manhattan), where the United Nations now stands. It was the first pencil factory opened in the United States.\n\nFaber also developed his own line of wax crayons by as early as 1883. E. Faber's wax crayons were available in packages of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 in a variety of assorted colors. While their cedar wood-encased crayons were a hybrid on the traditional all-wax crayon, this nonetheless should be regarded as one of the earliest available wax crayon products. Later they would offer traditional all-wax crayons as well. After a fire destroyed the original factory, they moved their location to Brooklyn. The Faber Company grew to become one of the largest pencil manufacturers in the world, with additional factories located in Germany, Canada, and Argentina.\n\nAnother one of the earliest recorded evidence of the modern paraffin wax crayon comes from Charles A. Bowley, a resident outside of Danvers, MA who developed what he thought were the first wax coloring crayons in the late 1880s. Mr. Bowley had been selling various stationery items around the vicinity of Danvers and had developed clumps of colored wax designed for marking leather. With the need for more accuracy, he went back to his home and formed the wax crayons into more manageable cylinder shapes similar to that of a pencil. The crayons were approximately five and one-half inches long and sold out quickly. He packaged his crayons into decorative boxes and offered them through stationer clients he knew. The demand for his crayons soon exceeded his ability to keep up with production and he contacted the American Crayon Company in 1902 to partner and create a full blown catalog of crayon offerings. \n\nThe Joseph Dixon Crucible Co. was formed in March 1868 from the existing Joe Dixon and Company that Joseph Dixon ran. While the company primarily produced pencils, like many of their contemporaries (E. Faber and Eagle Pencil) they too expanded into a line of wax crayons for offer in 1887. The Dixon Solid Crayons were offered in as many as 15 colors by 1902. In addition to their initial Dixon brand they went on to produce the Educator, Gem and Prestite lines of crayons before the company merged with American Crayon to form the Dixon Ticonderoga Company in 1983. They continue to produce numerous brands of crayons to today.\n\nLouis Prang, one of the principal fathers of art education in schools throughout the United States, also developed his own line of watercolor crayons, very similar to the modern wax-based crayon. Through his business, the Prang Educational Company, he sold several crayon products during the timeframe from the late 1880s through the early 20th century. Several examples of these exist in private collections to this day. In 1915 Prang merged his company into the American Crayon company and he served on the board for several years afterward. \n\nPerhaps one of the most mysterious companies to offer a full set of brands was a company simply known as B.B. (they have a trademarked double bumblebee on their logo.) They offered several boxes similar in size and composition to that of the earliest of crayon boxes from the late 19th century with products such as Cadet (featuring a civil war tent camp backdrop), Favorite, Junior Artists, and The Winner brands.\n\nFounded in 1860, the Milton Bradley Company is the oldest game manufacturer in the United States. They were also instrumental in the promotion of the early kindergarten movement rising up during the late 19th century. Bradley, inspired by a lecture from Elizabeth Peabody on the teachings of German scholar Friedrich Fröbel concerning education through creative activities, spent much of his life developing and selling products around this pursuit. Through the Milton Bradley Company, he produced wax crayons for retail as early as 1895 under the Bradley name. In addition to the Bradley line of crayons, they also produced Brodlyne, Copley, Banner, Big Boy, Crayrite, Economo, Embeco, Manual Art, Tru-Tone and Springfield Solid and other brands. In addition, they produced a series of licensed character crayon products such as Popeye, Mother Goose, Howdy Doody, Little Lulu, Moon Mullins, Lone Ranger, Little Orphan Annie and Sergeant William Preston. The company was acquired by Hasbro in 1984.\n\nThe Standard Crayon Company began their operations in the late 1890s. Though the exact date of their beginning is not clear, there is documentation on a receipt from the state of Maine from 1897. There is also information on size of the company from 1899 police report investigating child labor complaints (the company had 72 employees that year). It is also unclear exactly when they started producing wax crayon products but ads featuring their Centennial and Falcon brands of crayons began appearing as early as Jan 1900. They went on to produce Clover, Acme, Hummer, Gem, Crown, Crest Light, Bon-Ton, Crayel, Velazquez, Buster, Old Master, Viking, Bril-Tone, Murillo and other crayon lines before eventually being purchased by Binney & Smith Inc. in 1958.\n\nKnown for their chalk crayons, the American Crayon Company in Sandusky, OH spread out to the wax crayon market in 1902. As the popularity of Bowley's crayons spread to schools, his ability to keep up with production forced him to partner with the American Crayon Company who increased his manufacturing output by adopting his crayons and offering a full blown catalog of crayons in 1902. These boxes included The American Crescent Drawing Crayons in 7 and 14 color packages, the American Special School and Drawing Crayons in 7 and 14 colors, the American Electric drawing crayons in 7 and 12 colors, the American Brownie crayons in 7, 12 and 28 colors along with a wooden canister containing 14 colors, the American Perfection crayons in a wooden canister of 7 colors, the American Banner containing six colors and a pencil sharpener.\n\nThey continued to expand their crayon line to include brands such as Blendwel, Crayograph, Crayarto, Colorit, Crayonart, Crayonex, Emerald, Excello, Giant, Imperial, Kantroll, Kindograph, Kroma, Lakeshore, Old King Cole, Paragon, Pastello, Payons, Perfection, Popeye, Prang, Sketcho, Playmates, Waxena, Wonder and Young Artist brands among others. In 1957 they merged with Joseph Dixon Crucible which eventually merged to form Dixon Ticonderoga Company in 1983; which continues to make and sell crayons to this day.\n\nIn 1902 another pencil company began to offer up crayons. The Eagle Pencil Company, New York, NY, featured a line of wax crayons offered up in 6 and 12 count boxes with a color line that included White, Pink, Violet, Terrasienna, Yellow, Blue, Brick Red, Brown, Orange, Red, Green and Black. Eagle Pencil began in 1856 and quickly became one of the four major pencil manufacturers in the United States (Joseph Dixon Crucible, Eberhard Faber and American Lead Pencil were the others.) Though always considered a side item, they continued with their crayons through the mid 40s with the introduction of their Color-Glo Eagle crayons. They closed their NY factory in 1958 and under various mergers and acquisitions they still operate selling pencils to this day with Berol.\n\nThere isn't a lot of clear data on L. & C. Hardtmuth, New York, NY except to know that they were pencil and crayon manufacturers starting with crayons at least as early as 1903; perhaps even earlier. What is interesting about this company at this time was their large selection of crayon colors for the time. A 1905 ad describes 48 different colors available for sale; the most variety of colors coming out of any crayon manufacturer at the time.\n\nNew England Crayon Company began their crayon operations in 1905 under Wadsworth, Howland & Co. out of Boston, MA. This company ran until 1912. They introduced a line of Pride crayons featuring the popular \"The Brownies\" characters. They were available in 28 colors. Their factory boasted having the only steam operated molding machine back in 1907; allowing them cost efficiencies passed on to the consumer.\n\nAnother significant contributor to crayon history is Albert Henry Munsell, the professor who did scientific experiments in color that led to his published 1905 \"A Color Notation\" work. He created the Munsell Color System in 1915 and started his own Munsell Color Company in 1917. Initially he produced high quality coloring crayons through Wadsworth, Howland & Co. as early as 1906 and then later through his own company. In 1926, Binney & Smith purchased the Munsell Color Company's Munsell Crayon line, consisting of twenty-two colors: five principal and five intermediate hues, each at maximum chroma, and with middle value and middle chroma, plus middle grey and black. They kept the Munsell name on products such as \"Munsell-Crayola\" and \"Munsell-Perma\" up until 1934 and then incorporated their colors into their own Crayola Gold Medal line of boxes.\n\nThe Munsell colors were produced in specially-marked Crayola boxes until 1944, when wartime shortages made many of the pigments required for crayon production unavailable. When Binney & Smith resumed full production of Crayola crayons in 1949, the Munsell line was discontinued. A few of the colors were incorporated into the No. 48 box; Middle Yellow-Red became Medium Orange, and Maximum Blue became Blue-Green, while Middle Grey had been incorporated into the Crayola line as Neutral Gray, and later simply Gray. Medium Orange was discontinued in 1958, but Blue-Green and Gray remain part of the Crayola line.\n\nMany other companies took to producing crayons as well. J. Pressman out of New York had a license for Disney's Snow White characters and produced Snow White crayons for a short time. Ullman Mfg Co., NY was another early crayon adopter featuring their Priscilla brand of crayons. Hundreds of companies entered the crayon market, but only a few exist today, with Crayola dominating the market in the United States.\n\nIn all, there were over 300 documented crayon manufacturers in the United States and many more in other countries.\n\nBeyond Crayola, other brand name crayon manufacturers today include Rose Art Industries and Dixon Ticonderoga. There are also numerous suppliers who create generic brand or store brand crayons. These are typically found in supermarkets.\n\nIn 2000 there was a concern about potential contamination of asbestos in many popular brands of crayons after the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" reported in May of that year that they had tests performed finding that three brands of crayons contained asbestos. In a follow-up study released in June the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found traces of asbestos fibers in three crayons and larger amounts of transitional fibers which can be misinterpreted as asbestos as a result of using talc as a binding agent in additional crayons. CPSC declared the risk to be low, but said that because of the concerns it had asked manufacturers to reformulate the concerned crayons and commended them for their swift agreement to do so. Further tests have shown the risk to be insignificant, especially since the largest risk of asbestos is produced when it becomes friable and is then inhaled. Because the fibers are trapped in wax this is unlikely. As part of their testing the CPSC simulated heavy use by a child and did not find significant amounts of fibers released.\n\nEarly French artists, including Francois Clouet (1510-1572) and Nicholas L'agneau (1590-1666), used crayons in their early art projects. Clouet used crayons for his modeled portraits, which were so elaborate that he caught the attention of Henry V, who knighted him. He became court painter for the royalty, and his entire art career began and consisted of some wax crayon art. L'agneau illustrated his portraits with outlines in wax crayons, and with tints of watercolor. His portraits were often of people who looked surprised or unaware of their surroundings.\n\nSister Gertrude Morgan was most known for preaching the Gospel around New Orleans with simplicity and easy-to-understand crayon drawings. Morgan caught the eye of a gallery owner E. Lorenz Borenstein, and was allowed to show her work, play her music and spread her word of God at the gallery. Her early drawings were that of just very modest and simplicity crayon drawings, depicting biblical text to provide a clearer image to those who were unfamiliar with the Bible. Morgan went on to publish a record of her biblical songs and has artwork featured in the American Folk Art Museum in New York.\n\nModern artists working at a professional level with crayons include Don Marco, Kristina Nelson, and Jeffrey Robert.\n\n\n"}

The principal ingredients are usually barley, stewing or braising cuts of lamb, mutton or beef, root vegetables (such as carrots, swedes, or sometimes turnips), and dried pulses (most often split peas and red lentils). Cabbage and leeks are often added shortly before serving to preserve their texture, colour and flavours. The proportions and ingredients vary according to the recipe or availability. Scotch broth has been sold ready-prepared in cans for many years.\n\n"}
{"id": "46455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46455", "title": "Corn soup", "text": "Corn soup\n\nCorn soup is a soup made of corn (typically sweetcorn). It was normally made in corn-producing areas of the world, but is now widespread because of greater corn distribution. The basic recipe is some type of soup base with corn added followed by whatever ingredients give it its distinct style. Typically ingredients are corn cut from the cob, water, butter, some flour, an egg, with salt and pepper for seasoning — this varies by region.\n\nCorn, being a staple crop for many Native American tribes has led to corn soup being a primary food among them. M. R. Harrington reported that 1908 hulled-corn soup \"ono'kwǎ\"' was the most popular dish for the Seneca Indians. He also stated, \"[s]eldom do the Indians, pagan or Christian, meet for any function [...] without a kettle of ono'kwǎ', hot and savory, to regale the crowd\". The soup was served at religious events, the people getting a ladleful every time they encircled the kettle.\n\nSeveral types of soups are prepared using corn as a primary ingredient.\n\n"}
{"id": "46461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46461", "title": "Chicken soup", "text": "Chicken soup\n\nChicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.\n\nJust like other chicken dishes, the origin of chicken soup is linked to the history of the domestication of fowl, stretching back 7,000 to 10,000 years ago, which probably took place either in ancient India or Southeast Asia.\n\nThe popular version of the dish that today is recognised as American classic chicken soup, which typically uses root vegetables including carrot, onion, leeks, celery; was first a staple across Northern Europe. The recipes was brought to the United States by immigrants from Scotland, Poland, and ultimately can trace its origin to a version of chicken soup commonly served in Mennonites, Amish and Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nVariations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat off the top of the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.\n\nChicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top. A study determined that \"prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH\".\n\nStrictly speaking, chicken soup, unless qualified, implies that the soup is served as a thin broth, with pieces of meat, and possibly vegetables, and either noodles, rice, barley, or dumplings.\n\nCream of chicken soup is a thick, creamy, soup made with chicken stock and pieces, combined with milk (or cream) and flour, which might contain vegetable pieces, depending on the recipe. \n\nSeveral terms are used when referring to chicken soups:\n\n\nChicken soup has long been touted as a form of folk medicine to treat symptoms of the common cold and related conditions. In 2000, scientists at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha studied the effect of chicken soup on the inflammatory response \"in vitro\". They found that some components of the chicken soup inhibit neutrophil migration, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect that could \"hypothetically\" lead to temporary ease from symptoms of illness. However, since these results have been obtained from purified cells (and directly applied), the diluted soup \"in vivo\" effect is debatable. \"The New York Times\" reviewed the University of Nebraska study, among others, in 2007 and concluded that \"none of the research is conclusive, and it is not known whether the changes measured in the laboratory really have a meaningful effect on people with cold symptoms.\"\n\nIt has also been shown that chicken soup contains the amino acid cysteine, which is very similar to acetylcysteine, which is used by doctors for patients with bronchitis and other respiratory infections to help clear them.\n\nChicken soup is also known as \"Jewish penicillin\", either as ersatz good penicillin, or as alternative to penicillin.\n\nMany Chinese soups are based on chicken broth. Typical Chinese chicken soup is made from old hens and is seasoned with ginger, scallions, black pepper, soy sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. A more elaborate version can be made from freshly killed old hen and various herbs such as ginseng, dried goji, and old ginger root. The soup is then boiled for hours.\n\nBogotá, Colombia’s capital, is known for a version of chicken soup called \"ajiaco\". Along with chicken, \"ajiaco\" typically includes corn, three types of potatoes, avocado, capers, an herb called \"guascas\", and is served with a dollop of cream.\n\nSancocho de Gallina is another popular dish throughout Colombia and in neighboring countries. This is a broth that includes entire pieces of (often rather tough) soup hen on the bone with large pieces of plantain, potato, cassava and/or other vegetables. A bowl of Sancocho is usually an entire meal. There are Region, as in Medellin — Antioquia, that some people enjoy Sancocho with lemon.\n\nThe Danish \"hønsekødssuppe\" is traditionally cooked using large hens specifically reserved for soup, known as \"suppehøner\" (\"soup-hens\"). Vegetables like celeriac, carrots, onions and leek are usually added and typical flavourings are thyme, laurels and white pepper. The soup may be served with small white dumplings and meatballs. As part of traditional housekeeping, the cooked meat is reserved for other dishes such as \"høns i asparges\" (\"hens in asparagus\") or \"hønsesalat\" (\"hens-salad\").\n\nThe French serve chicken-based forms of bouillon and consommé. Typical French seasonings for chicken soup includes: bay leaves, fresh thyme, dry white wine and garlic.\n\nIn Germany chicken soup is made with chicken broth, vegetables, such as carrots, spices and herbs and small noodles. For the broth, a large hen, called a \"Suppenhuhn\" (lit.: \"soup hen\"), may be boiled, and pieces of it—especially from the boiled breast—can later be added to the soup.\nIn southern Germany homemade chicken soup typically consists of chicken broth, to which spices and semolina dumplings or \"Spätzle\" noodles are added. Another dish made with chicken broth, pieces of chicken, boiled vegetables, and spices is known as \"Hühnereintopf\", meaning \"chicken stew\". Alternatively, homemade noodles may be added to the chicken broth, without vegetables, and with only pickling spice, salt and pepper added to it.\n\nIn Ghana, chicken soup is often seasoned with lemon juice or vinegar.\nVery often people add a mixture of yogurt and egg towards the end of the cooking process to make the soup denser and creamier. One egg and 100–150mL of yogurt are combined in a deep cup and mixed until smooth. This gets stirred slowly into the soup after the pot is removed from heat to prevent curdling. Finely fresh chopped parsley is often added before serving. \n\nIn Greece, chicken soup is most commonly made in the \"avgolemono\" (\"egg-lemon\") fashion, wherein beaten eggs mixed with lemon are added to a broth slowly so that the mixture heats up without curdling, also adding rice or pasta like \"kritharáki\" (\"little barley;\" orzo), resulting in a thicker texture; it is a traditional remedy for colds, stomach aches, and hangovers.\n\nHungarian chicken soup is a clear soup, a consommé, called Újházi chicken soup. A consommé with entire pieces of chicken, chicken liver and heart, with chunky vegetables and spices like whole black peppercorn, bay leaves, salt and ground black pepper. The vegetables boiled along with the pieces of chicken are usually carrots, celeriac, parsley root and parsnip. Soup vermicelli, semolina dumplings or thin Spätzle noodles or small dumplings are also added to the soup. Even other vegetables may be used, such as green peas, a whole tomato and whole onions boiled along with the soup, mushrooms, asparagus, celery, green pepper, cauliflower, kohlrabi, green beans or parsley, in different combinations.\n\nIn Indonesia chicken soup might appear as \"sayur sop\", vegetable and chicken broth soup that contains chicken pieces, potato, green beans, carrot, celery, and fried shallot. Another chicken soup variant commonly found across the country is soto ayam; a turmeric yellow spicy chicken soup with vegetables and noodle or vermicelli, served with steamed rice, pieces of lontong or ketupat.\n\nIn India chicken soup is one of the most popular appetizers. There are many forms of chicken soup which exist, Sweet Corn Chicken Soup being the most famous. Other variants of chicken soup are Spicy Indian Chicken Soup, Clear Chicken Soup, Hot and Sour and Chicken Noodle Soup. Usually most of the Chicken soups are served with Bread Crumbs and sometimes with boiled eggs too. It is a very popular selling item by the road side vendors and Dhaba usually in winters.\n\nIn Italy, chicken soup is often served with pasta, in such dishes as \"cappelletti in brodo\", \"tortellini in brodo\" and \"passatelli\". Even when served on its own, the meat and any vegetables used are usually removed from the broth and served as a second dish.\n\nIn Japan, chicken soup is known as \"torijiru\". Typically it starts with dashi, which is made from boiling konbu (kelp) and katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets). After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like daikon radish, carrot, burdock, konnyaku, welsh onion, mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on the region of the country or type of soup. It could be a miso-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking sake, mirin, salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called \"butajiru\" is more popular than the chicken-based soup.\n\nBone stocks for ramen are also often made with chicken stock, and it is almost invariably used in the less common \"kotteri\" variety.\n\nChicken soup is a traditional dish of the Jewish kitchen.\nThe soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, was often served with \"knaidlach\" (matzah balls), \"kreplach\" (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or \"mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel)\" (soup \"almonds\"). A traditional garnish was \"eyerlekh\" (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.\" Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now.\n\n\"Samgyetang\" is a Korean chicken soup with Korean ginseng, dried jujube fruits, garlic, ginger, glutinous rice, and sometimes other medicinal herbs. It is held to be not only a cure for physical ailments but a preventer of sickness. \"Baeksuk\", which is the Korean counterpart to the chicken noodle soup of Western culture, is also popular among Koreans for its power to cure minor illnesses such as a cold. While the chicken noodle soup, as the name suggests, has some noodles in it, quite often Baeksuk does not contain any noodles.\n\nCaldo de pollo, also known as Consome de Pollo, is a common Latin-American soup made with whole chicken pieces instead of chopped or shredded chicken, and large cuts of vegetables, such as half-slices of potatoes and whole leaves of cabbage. Another variation of chicken soup is caldo tlalpeño which is garnished with chopped avocado, white cheese, and a chipotle chile.\n\nIn Pakistan various forms of chicken soups exist. The most famous one is Chicken Corn Soup. Other variants are Chicken Egg Soup and Simple Chicken Soup.\n\nAguadito de pollo is a traditional chicken soup in Peruvian cuisine consisting of chicken, cilantro, vegetables and spices.\n\nCaldo de Gallina (lit., \"broth of hen\"), the Peruvian form of chicken soup, is made with whole pieces of chicken instead of chopped or shredded chicken, along with potatoes, egg noodles, and hard-boiled eggs. Lime wedges and chili or aji pepper paste are added as condiments.\n\nChicken soup in the Philippines is called \"sopas\" and has some western influences in it. While there are many variations in the recipe, it usually contains chicken strips in broth, onions, vegetables (mainly carrots, cabbage and celery), and macaroni noodles. It is cooked with evaporated milk to give it richer flavor. \"Sopas\" is normally associated with the cold, rainy season in the Philippines, and may thus be regarded as local comfort food.\n\nAnother chicken soup is called \"mami\" which its style derives from its other Asian neighboring countries, especially East Asia and normally served with sliced chicken, broth, noodles, chopped vegetables. Mami is also associated with the cold, rainy season as well.\n\nOther chicken dishes are considered soups. \"Tinola\" has chicken cuts in broth, with ginger, chayote, and chili pepper leaves. \"Sinampalukang manok\" is basically just a chicken version of \"sinigang\", but here the meat is browned first before being boiled in the water.\n\nThe Polish chicken soup is called rosół. It is commonly served with fine noodles, boiled carrots and sometimes parsley. The broth is served separate from chicken meat.\n\nChicken soup is known as canja, a chicken broth prepared with rice or pasta and shredded chicken meat. It is believed to help a person overcome colds and digestive problems, among other mild forms of sickness.\n\nIn most regions of Romania, chicken soup known as ciorbă de pui consists of a clear or dense sour soup with strained chicken and vegetable broth, sometimes noodles have been added. Different versions, uses pieces of chicken and pieces of boiled vegetables (examples: onion, carrot, parsnip, celery, zucchini, peas, beans, leaves and root of parsley, peppers) and is seasoned usually with sour cream (smântână), tomato juice, lemon juice or borş.\n\nIn Taiwan-style chicken soup dried jujube fruits, dried shiitake, and other various herbs also sometimes added. While it may be possible to use regular ginseng in the recipe, a special type of ginseng called San qi is commonly used. This is grown almost exclusively in Wenshan County, Yunnan Province. The roots are powdered for ease of use, although it may also be possible to use the flowerheads. \n\nUkrainians traditionally prefer an often simple chicken and vegetable bouillon with added noodles or rice, and a pinch of fresh herbs. Another type of chicken soup in Ukraine includes chicken, noodles, carrot, potato and onion. Some cooks add chopped boiled egg and even sour cream to their variations of the soup.\n\nTraditionally, chicken soup (or broth) in Britain is a clear and watery soup with chunky vegetables (such as carrot, celery and onion), chicken, salt and pepper. However, a thick, creamy variety called cream of chicken soup, which may not contain any vegetable pieces (depending on the recipe), is more popular today. A distinct version from Scotland that has become popular throughout the UK is cock-a-leekie soup, a clear, thin broth of shredded chicken and leeks.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, chicken soup often has noodles or rice in it, thus giving it its common name of \"chicken noodle soup\". The term may have been coined in a commercial for the Campbell Soup Company in the 1930s. The original 21 varieties of Campbell's condensed soup featured a \"chicken soup with noodles\", but when it was advertised on the \"Amos 'n' Andy\" radio show in the 1930s by a slip of the tongue the soup was referred to as \"chicken noodle soup\". Traditionally, American chicken soup was prepared using old hens too tough and stringy to be roasted or cooked for a short time. In modern times, these fowl are difficult to come by, and broiler chickens (young chickens suitable for roasting or broiling) are often used to make soup.\n\nTypically sold as a condensed soup, canned chicken soup, such as Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, is notable for its high sodium content, 890 mg per 1/2 cup serving, giving a 1 1/2 cup bowl of soup about 2,500 mg, a full days allowance in the case of the mainstream brand, Campbell's. Other condensed chicken soups such as Chicken with Rice or Chicken & Stars Soup produced by Campbell have similar amounts, as do generic versions of the product. Canned chicken soup with much less sodium than the traditional formulation is available, including many varieties produced by Campbell's, some with at little as 100 mg of sodium. Campbell's claims production of a chicken noodle soup that will find broad consumer acceptance, in short, that will sell, is very difficult.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be made with flat top or unpeeled apples and a variety of spices (commonly cinnamon and allspice). Flavorings or sweeteners such as sugar or honey are also commonly added. Apple sauce is inexpensive and widely used in North America and some European countries.\n\nIt can be substituted for fat (e.g. butter/oil) in baking.\n\nCommercial maps of apple sauce are readily available in supermarkets.\n\nApple sauce is made by cooking down apples with water or apple cider (fresh apple juice) to the required level. More acidic apples will render a finer purée; the highly acidic Bramley apple is popular for creating a very fine purée. Apples may or may not be peeled; sugar, spices, or lemon juice could also be added for flavoring. Apple butter is similar to apple sauce, but has a high cider to apple ratio, of 8 liters to 100 kilograms.\nApple sauce was once a food prepared for winter, since it keeps well. It is often an accompaniment to a main course and goes perfectly with roast potatoes and vegetables. In Sweden and Britain, for instance, apple sauce is usually eaten as a condiment for roast pork. In Germany it accompanies potato pancakes, in the Netherlands, french fries. It is also a popular accompaniment in the United States and is sometimes served as a dessert there as well, alone or used in making apple sauce cake. It is also used alone with toast as a snack. In France where it is referred to as \"compote\", it is mostly viewed as a dessert and served at room temperature, with the notable exception of \"boudin aux pommes\" (dark blood sausage with apple sauce). In Portugal as well, \"maçã cozida\" (cooked apple) is solely viewed as a dessert.\nApple sauce can be used in baking as a substitute for fat (such as butter or oil) or eggs.\n\nSince it is high in pectin (more of which can be added during the cooking process), apple sauce is a homemade remedy to combat diarrhea. Apple sauce is thus a component of the regimen devised to help children with diarrhea and stomach problems, also known as the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, apple sauce, and toast.\n\nApplesauce is believed to have been created in the 1700s in Europe. \n\n"}

It is a porridge, a thick boiled grain dish - hence its name, which derives from the Latin word \"frumentum\", \"grain\". It was usually made with cracked wheat boiled with either milk or broth. As such, it was a peasant staple. More luxurious recipes include eggs, almonds, currants, sugar, saffron and orange flower water. Frumenty was served with meat as a pottage, traditionally with venison or occasionally porpoise (considered a \"fish\" and therefore appropriate for Lent). It was also frequently used as a subtlety, a dish between courses at a banquet.\n\nFlorence White, founder of the English Folk Cookery Association, wrote in \"Good Things in England\" (1932) that frumenty is England's \"oldest national dish\". For several centuries, frumenty was part of the traditional Celtic Christmas meal. According to an 1822 \"Time's Telescope\", in Yorkshire, on Christmas Eve:\nIt was often eaten on Mothering Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent, i.e. late spring. On that day many servants were allowed to visit their mothers and were often served frumenty to celebrate and give them a wholesome meal to prepare them for their return journey. The use of eggs would have been a brief respite from the Lenten fast. In Lincolnshire, frumenty was associated with sheep-shearing in June. A diarist recalled of his youth in the 1820s that \"almost every farmer in the village made a large quantity of frumenty on the morning they began to clip; and every child in the village was invited to partake of it\". A second batch, of better quality, was produced later and taken round in buckets to every house in the village.\n\nFood historian Polly Russell describes one of the first English recipes for it in the 1390 manuscript \"The Forme of Cury\", and how this served as the inspiration for the 2013 Christmas menu at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, transforming Victorian workhouse food for paupers into modern luxurious dining.\n\n\"Frumentee\" is served with venison at a banquet in the mid-14th century North Midlands poem \"Wynnere and Wastoure\": \"Venyson with the frumentee, and fesanttes full riche / Baken mete therby one the burde sett\", i.e. in modern English, \"Venison with the frumenty and pheasants full rich; baked meat by it on the table set\". The dish also appears, likewise paired with venison, at the New Year feast in the Middle English poem known as \"The Alliterative Morte Arthure\" (c.1400): \"Flesh flourisht of fermison, with frumentee noble.\"\n\nThe dish, described as 'furmity' and served with fruit and a slug of rum added under the counter, plays a role in the plot of Thomas Hardy's novel \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\". It is also mentioned in Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\" as a food that snapdragon flies live on.\n\nSteve Roud, librarian and folklorist, compiled a compendium of \"The English Year\" including three recipes for frumenty. They show considerable variation with place and time.\nA healthy dose of spirit is often mentioned as accompanying the frumenty.\n\nA dish made with boiled cracked wheat and soured milk was made in antiquity in Persia, and is still used, often as the basis for a soup, in Greece and Cyprus (as \"trahanas\"), and in Turkey (\"tarhana\").

It was co-created by Michele Ferrero and William Salice, and is one of several candies sold under the Kinder brand. Each chocolate egg surrounds a plastic capsule that contains a small toy. Kinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children large chocolate eggs with a toy inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Since 1974, 30 billion Kinder Surprise eggs have been sold worldwide.\n\nKinder Surprise is a hollow milk chocolate egg, lined with a layer of sweet milk-flavored cream. Inside each egg is a plastic capsule that contains a small surprise toy, which sometimes requires assembly. The capsule case is yellow, reportedly to resemble an egg's yolk. The chocolates have foil packaging with warning labels advising parents to avoid giving the eggs to children under three years old, and encouraging supervision during consumption.\n\nKinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children a large chocolate egg with a toy inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Collectors often try to acquire all toys within a themed set. Some even share their egg openings on social media, or create their own toys and re-wrap them in Kinder Surprise packaging. More than 100 new toys are distributed each year. Around 12,000 different toys had been included within Kinder Surprise as of 2016.\n\nAccording to CNNMoney, Kinder Surprise is most popular in Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Michele Ferrero and William Salice have been credited as co-creators of the candy.\n\nIn 1968, Michele Ferrero raised the idea with his employees of a product that could be given to children so they could have a little \"surprise\" every day, based on the Italian tradition of large chocolate eggs given to children by their parents at Easter. Ferrero said that at first his attempt to follow through this idea was unsuccessful after employees questioned the order he placed for a machine to make the chocolate eggs. They thought it would not be profitable, since eggs are only for Easter. Ferrero also said that he wanted the product to have a higher milk content and make that a key part of its promotion; he felt that mothers would respond well to the idea of giving their children more milk. Ferrero commissioned William Salice to realize the concept.\n\nThe Italian company Ferrero began manufacturing Kinder Surprises in 1974. Since then around 30 billion eggs have been sold worldwide.\n\nSalice, who has been credited as the inventor of Kinder Surprise but insisted he was just \"material executor\", died in Italy in December 2016, at the age of 83.\n\nThe toys within Kinder Surprise have been themed for various popular children's characters. Collections of Kinder Surprise toys have included Asterix, Fantasmini, Smurfs, and Minions. Ferrero and Kinder have also partnered with various companies, institutions, and people to promote Kinder Surprise, including The Walt Disney Company, Universal, and Smart.\n\nIn 2000, three families who had lost children to choking on toys inside edible eggs campaigned for the products to be withdrawn from the European Union. Ten children worldwide have died from choking on parts of the Kinder toy surprises after they had eaten the chocolate egg; another was attributed to another manufacturer’s product.\n\nDefenders of the chocolates said that these had been unfortunate fatalities. This was discussed in the House of Commons and also by the Department of Trade and Industry which said, \"The child’s tragic death was caused by the ingestion of a small part of the egg’s contents. Many other products and toys with small parts are available in the market place. If we were to start banning every product that could be swallowed by a child, there would be very few toys left in the market”.\n\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits confectionery products which contain a “non-nutritive object”, unless the non-nutritive object has functional value. Essentially, the Act bans \"the sale of any candy that has embedded in it a toy or trinket\".\n\nIn 1997, the staff of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) examined and issued a recall for some Kinder Surprise illegally brought into the US with foreign labels. The staff determined that the toys within the eggs had small parts. The staff presumed that Kinder Surprise, being a chocolate product, was intended for children of all ages, including those under three years of age. On this basis, the staff took the position that Kinder Surprise was in violation of the small parts regulation and should be banned from importation into the US.\n\nKinder Surprise eggs are legal in Canada and Mexico, but are illegal to import into the US. In January 2011, the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) threatened a Manitoba resident with a $300 (Canadian dollars) fine for carrying one egg across the US border into Minnesota. In June 2012, CBP held two Seattle men for two and a half hours after discovering six Kinder Surprise eggs in their car upon returning to the US from a trip to Vancouver. According to one of the men detained, a border guard quoted the potential fine as US $2,500 per egg.\n\nIn 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) re-issued their import alert stating “The embedded non-nutritive objects in these confectionery products may pose a public health risk as the consumer may unknowingly choke on the object”.\n\nKinder Surprise bears warnings advising the consumer that the toy is \"not suitable for children under three years, due to the presence of small parts\", and that \"adult supervision is recommended\".\n\nSince 2017, Kinder Joy eggs (where a toy is not encased in chocolate shell) are sold in the United States, though Kinder Surprise eggs are still banned.\n\nIn 2016, new food labeling and packaging laws resulted in Chile banning the Kinder Surprise.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46875", "title": "Puff pastry", "text": "Puff pastry\n\nPuff pastry, also known as , is a flaky light pastry made from a laminated dough composed of dough (') and butter or other solid fat ('). The butter is put inside the dough (or vice versa), making a \"\" which is repeatedly folded and rolled out before baking.\n\nThe gaps that form between the layers left by the fat melting are pushed (leavened) by the water turning into steam during the baking process.\n\nPuff pastry seems to be related to the Middle Eastern phyllo, and is used in a similar manner to create layered pastries. While traditionally ascribed to the French painter and cook Claude Lorrain who lived in the 17th century (the story goes that Lorrain was making a type of very buttery bread for his sick father, and the process of rolling the butter into the bread dough created a croissant-like finished product), references to puff pastry appear before the 17th century, indicating a history that came originally through Muslim Spain and was converted from thin sheets of dough spread with olive oil to laminated dough with layers of butter.\n\nThe first known recipe of modern puff pastry (using butter or lard), appears in the Spanish recipe book \"Libro del arte de cozina\" (\"Book on the art of cooking\") written by Domingo Hernández de Maceras and published in 1607. Maceras, the head cook in one of the colleges of the University of Salamanca, already distinguished between filled puff pastry recipes and puff pastry tarts, and even mentions leavened preparations. Thus, puff pastry appears to have had widespread use in Spain by the beginning of the 17th century. The first French recipe of puff pastry was published in François Pierre La Varenne's \"Pastissier françois\" in 1653.\n\nThe production of puff pastry dough can be time-consuming, because it must be kept at a temperature of approximately 16 °C (60 °F) to keep shortening from becoming runny, and must rest in between folds to allow gluten strands time to link up and thus retain layering.\n\nThe number of layers in puff pastry is calculated with the formula:\n\nwhere formula_2 is the number of finished layers, formula_3 the number of folds in a single folding move, and formula_4 is how many times the folding move is repeated. For example, twice-folding (i.e. in three), repeated four times gives formula_5 layers. Chef Julia Child recommends 73 layers for regular \"pâte feuilletée\" and 729 (i.e. 3) layers for \"pâte feuilletée fine\" (in Volume II of her \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" textbook).\n\nCommercially made puff pastry is available in grocery stores. Common types of fat used include butter, vegetable shortenings, and lard. Butter is the most common type used because it provides a richer taste and superior mouthfeel. Shortenings and lard have a higher melting point therefore puff pastry made with either will rise more than pastry made with butter, if made correctly. Puff pastry made in this manner will however often have a waxy mouthfeel and more bland flavor. Specialized margarine formulated for high plasticity (the ability to spread very thin without breaking apart) is used for industrial production of puff pastry.\n\nSince the process of making puff pastry is generally laborious and time-intensive, faster recipes are fairly common: known as \"blitz\", \"rough puff\", or \"flaky pastry\". Many of these recipes combine the butter into the \"\" rather than adding it in the folding process and are thus similar to a folded short crust.\n\nPuff pastry can also be leavened with baker's yeast to create croissants, Danish pastry, Spanish/Portuguese milhoja, or empanadilla; though such preparations are not universally considered puff pastries.\n\nPuff pastry differs from phyllo (filo) pastry, though puff pastry can be substituted for phyllo in some applications. Phyllo dough is made with flour, water, and fat and is stretched to size rather than rolled. When preparing phyllo dough, a small amount of oil or melted fat (usually butter) is brushed on one layer of dough and is topped with another layer, a process repeated as often as desired. When the phyllo bakes it becomes crispy but, since it contains somewhat less water, does not expand to the same degree as puff pastry. Puff pastry also differs from Austrian strudel dough, or Strudelteig, which more closely resembles phyllo.\n\n\n"}

Its ingredients are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought with them Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits and spices.\n\nThe early mince pie was known by several names, including \"mutton pie\", \"shrid pie\" and \"Christmas pie\". Typically its ingredients were a mixture of minced meat, suet, a range of fruits, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Served around Christmas, the savoury Christmas pie (as it became known) was associated with supposed Catholic \"idolatry\" and during the English Civil War was frowned on by the Puritan authorities. Nevertheless, the tradition of eating Christmas pie in December continued through to the Victorian era, although by then its recipe had become sweeter and its size markedly reduced from the large oblong shape once observed. Today the mince pie, usually made without meat (but often including suet or other animal fats), remains a popular seasonal treat enjoyed by many across the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nThe ingredients for the modern mince pie can be traced to the return of European crusaders from the Holy Land. Middle Eastern methods of cooking, which sometimes combined meats, fruits and spices, were popular at the time. Pies were created from such mixtures of sweet and savoury foods; in Tudor England, shrid pies (as they were known then) were formed from shredded meat, suet and dried fruit. The addition of spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg was, according to the English antiquary John Timbs, \"in token of the offerings of the Eastern Magi.\" Several authors, including Timbs, viewed the pie as being derived from an old Roman custom practised during Saturnalia, where Roman fathers in the Vatican were presented with sweetmeats. Early pies were much larger than those consumed today, and oblong shaped; the jurist John Selden presumed that \"the coffin of our \"Christmas\"-Pies, in shape long, is in Imitation of the Cratch [Jesus's crib]\", although writer T. F. Thistleton-Dyer thought Selden's explanation unlikely, as \"in old English cookery books the crust of a pie is generally called 'the coffin.\nThe modern mince pie's precursor was known by several names. The antiquary John Brand claimed that in Elizabethan and Jacobean-era England they were known as minched pies, but other names include mutton pie, and starting in the following century, Christmas pie. Gervase Markham's 1615 recipe recommends taking \"a leg of mutton\", and cutting \"the best of the flesh from the bone\", before adding mutton suet, pepper, salt, cloves, mace, currants, raisins, prunes, dates and orange peel. He also suggested that beef or veal might be used in place of mutton. In the north of England, goose was used in the pie's filling, but more generally neat's tongue was also used; a North American filling recipe published in 1854 includes chopped neat's tongue, beef suet, blood raisins, currants, mace, cloves, nutmeg, brown sugar, apples, lemons, brandy and orange peel. During the English Civil War, along with the censure of other Catholic customs, they were banned: \"Nay, the poor rosemary and bays, and \"Christmas pie\", is made an abomination.\" Puritans were opposed to the Christmas pie, on account of its connection with Catholicism. In his \"History of the Rebellion\", Marchamont Needham wrote \"All Plums the Prophets Sons defy, And Spice-broths are too hot; Treason's in a \"December\"-Pye, And Death within the Pot.\" Some considered them unfit to occupy the plate of a clergyman, causing Philo-Clericus to comment:\n\nIn his essay \"The Life of Samuel Butler\", Samuel Johnson wrote of \"an old Puritan, who was alive in my childhood ... would have none of his superstitious meats and drinks.\" Another essay, published in the December 1733 issue of \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", explained the popularity of \"Christmas Pye\" as perhaps \"owing to the Barrenness of the Season, and the Scarcity of Fruit and Milk, to make Tarts, Custards, and other Desserts\", but also possibly bearing \"a religious kind of Relation to the Festivity from which it takes its Name.\" The author also mentions the Quakers' objection to the treat, \"who distinguish their Feasts by an heretical Sort of Pudding, known by their Names, and inveigh against Christmas Pye, as an Invention of the Scarlet Whore of \"Babylon\", an Hodge-Podge of Superstition, Popery, the Devil and all his Works.\" Nevertheless, the Christmas pie remained a popular treat at Christmas, although smaller and sweeter, and lacking in post-Reformation England any sign of supposed Catholic idolatry. People began to prepare the fruit and spice filling months before it was required, storing it in jars, and as Great Britain entered the Victorian age, the addition of meat had, for many, become an afterthought (although the use of suet remains). Its taste then was broadly similar to that experienced today, although some 20th-century writers continued to advocate the inclusion of meat.\n\nAlthough the modern recipe is no longer the same list of 13 ingredients once used (representative of Christ and his 12 Apostles according to author Margaret Baker), and lacks the religious meaning contained therein, the mince pie remains a popular Christmas treat. Bakers Greggs reported sales of 7.5 million mince pies during Christmas 2011. The popular claim that the consumption of mince pies on Christmas Day is illegal is in fact an urban myth.\n\nMincemeat pie was brought to New England by English settlers in the 17th century. While it was originally a Christmas pie, as in Britain, the Puritans did not celebrate Christmas, causing the pie's associations in the region to shift toward the American holiday of Thanksgiving. The ingredients for New England mincemeat pie are similar to the British one, with a mixture of apples, raisins, spices, and minced beef serving as the filling. Later recipes sometimes omit the beef, though \"None Such\" (now owned by The J.M. Smucker Company), the major brand of condensed American mincemeat, still contains beef. New England mincemeat pies are usually full-sized pies, as opposed to the individual-sized pies now common in Britain.\n\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Shortcrust pastry can be used to make both sweet and savory pies such as apple pie, quiche, lemon meringue or chicken pie.\n\nShortcrust pastry recipes usually calls for twice as much flour as fat by weight. Fat (lard, shortening, butter or full-fat margarine) is rubbed into plain flour to create a loose mixture that is then bound using a small amount of ice water, rolled out, then shaped and placed to create the top or bottom of a flan or meat pie. Often, equal amounts of butter and lard are used to make the pastry, ensuring that the ratio of the two fat products is half that of the flour. The butter is employed to give the pastry a rich flavor, while the lard ensures optimum texture.\n\n\nIn preparing a shortcrust, the fat and flour are \"cut\" into each other, rather than blended, and the ingredients are kept cold. This ensures that the fat remains distinct in the crust, and when it heats during baking, steam is released, resulting in the pockets that make a flaky crust. Water is only added once the fat and flour are thoroughly combined. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and are less likely to develop gluten. This may be achieved with the use of a food processor, a specialized kitchen utensil called a pastry blender, or through various alternatives, like a pair of table knives held in one hand.\n\nOverworking the dough is also a hazard. Overworking elongates the gluten strands, creating a product that is tough, rather than light and crumbly or flaky.\n\n"}

Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.\n\nTypes of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella (), seafood paella (), and mixed paella (), among many others. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice (which must be round grain), green beans (\"bajoqueta\" and \"tavella\"), meat (chicken and rabbit, sometimes duck), \"garrofó\" (a variety of lima beans or butterbeans), sometimes snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Also, artichoke hearts and stems are used as seasonal ingredients. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.\n\nPaella is a Valencian word which derives from the Old French word \"paelle\" for pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word \"patella\" for pan.\n\nThe word \"paella\" is also related to \"paila\" used in many Latin American countries. \"Paila\" in the Spanish language of Latin America refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.\n\nThe Latin root \"patella\" from which \"paella\" derives is also akin to the modern French \"poêle\", the Italian \"padella\" and the Old Spanish \"padilla\".\n\nValencians use the word \"paella\" for all pans in the Valencian language, including the specialized shallow pan used for cooking paellas. However, in most other parts of Spain and throughout Hispanic America where the Spanish language is spoken, the term \"paellera\" is more commonly used for the specialised pan while \"paella\" is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it, although both terms are deemed correct for the pan, as stated by the Royal Spanish Academy, the body responsible for regulating the Spanish language in Spain. \"Paelleras\" are traditionally round, shallow, and made of polished steel with two handles.\n\nSome claim that the word \"paella\" comes from the Arabic بَقيَّة, pronounced \"baqiyyah\", meaning \"leftovers\". This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which Moorish kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal. However, this etymology is impossible because paella didn't appear until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by Jaume I.\n\nMoors in Muslim Spain began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Consequently, Valencians often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterwards, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's eastern coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.\n\nSpanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries.\"\n\nOn special occasions, 18th century Valencians used \"calderos\" to cook rice in the open air of their orchards near lake Albufera. Water vole meat was one of the main ingredients of early paellas, along with eel and butter beans. Novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez described the Valencian custom of eating water voles in \"Cañas y Barro\" (1902), a realistic novel about life among the fishermen and peasants near lake Albufera.\n\nLiving standards rose with the sociological changes of the late 19th century in Spain, giving rise to gatherings and outings in the countryside. This led to a change in paella's ingredients, as well, using instead rabbit, chicken, duck and sometimes snails. This dish became so popular that in 1840, a local Spanish newspaper first used the word \"paella\" to refer to the recipe rather than the pan.\n\nThe most widely used, complete ingredient list of this era was: short-grain white rice, chicken, rabbit, snails (optional), duck (optional), butter beans, great northern beans, runner beans, artichoke (a substitute for runner beans in the winter), tomatoes, fresh rosemary, sweet paprika, saffron, garlic (optional), salt, olive oil, and water. Poorer Valencians, however, sometimes used nothing more than snails for meat. Valencians insist that only these ingredients should go into making modern Valencian paella.\n\nOn the Mediterranean coast, Valencians used seafood instead of meat and beans to make paella. Valencians regard this recipe as authentic, as well. In this recipe, the seafood is served in the shell. A variant on this is \"paella del senyoret\" which uses seafood without shells. Later, however, Spaniards living outside of Valencia combined seafood with meat from land animals and mixed paella was born. This paella is sometimes called \"preparación barroca\" (baroque preparation) due to the variety of ingredients and its final presentation.\n\nDuring the 20th century, paella's popularity spread past Spain's borders. As other cultures set out to make paella, the dish invariably acquired regional influences. Consequently, paella recipes went from being relatively simple to including a wide variety of seafood, meat, sausage (including chorizo), vegetables and many different seasonings. However, the most globally popular recipe is seafood paella.\n\nThroughout non-Valencian Spain, mixed paella is relatively easy to find. Some restaurants both in Spain and abroad that serve this mixed version refer to it as \"Valencian\" paella. However, Valencians insist that only the original two Valencian recipes are authentic, and generally view all others as inferior, not genuine or even grotesque.\n\nAccording to tradition in Valencia, paella is cooked over an open fire, fueled by orange and pine branches along with pine cones. This produces an aromatic smoke which infuses the paella. Also, dinner guests traditionally eat directly out of the \"paellera\".\n\nSome recipes call for paella to be covered and left to settle for five to ten minutes after cooking.\n\nThis recipe is standardized because Valencians consider it traditional and very much part of their culture. Rice in Valencian paella is never braised in oil, as pilaf, though the paella made further southwest of Valencia often is.\n\n\nRecipes for this dish vary somewhat, even in Valencia. The recipe below is based on the two cited here.\n\nThere are countless mixed paella recipes. The following method is common to most of these. Seasoning depends greatly on individual preferences and regional influences. However, salt, saffron and garlic are almost always included.\n\nAfter cooking paella, there is usually a layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, called \"socarrat\" in Catalan. This is considered a delicacy among connoiseurs and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the \"paella\" over a high flame while listening to the rice toast at the bottom of the pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is removed from the heat. The paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.\n\nIt has become a custom at mass gatherings in the Valencian Community (festivals, political campaigns, protests, etc.) to prepare enormous paellas, sometimes to win a place in the \"Guinness World Records\" book. Chefs use gargantuan \"paelleras\" for these events.\n\nValencian restaurateur Juan Galbis claims to have made the world's largest paella with help from a team of workers on 2 October 2001. This paella fed about 110,000 people according to Galbis' former website. Galbis says this paella was even larger than his earlier world-record paella made on 8 March 1992 which fed about 100,000 people. Galbis's record-breaking 1992 paella is listed in \"Guinness World Records\".\n\nSome non-Spanish chefs include chorizo in their paellas along with other ingredients which Valencians believe don't belong in paella of any type. The alternative name proposed for these dishes, although pejorative, is ('rice with things'). Famous cases are Jamie Oliver's paella recipe (which included chorizo) and Gordon Ramsay's. The author Josep Pla once noted:\n\nHowever, in an article in El País the Spanish food writer Ana Vega 'Biscayenne', citing historical references, showed that traditional Valencian paella did indeed include chorizo, exclaiming, \"Ah Jamie, we'll have to invite you to the Falles\".\n\nTraditional Valencian cuisine offers recipes similar to \"paella valenciana\" and \"paella de marisco\" such as \"arròs negre\", \"arròs al forn\", \"arròs a banda\" and \"arròs amb fesols i naps\". Fideuà is a noodle dish variation of the paella cooked in a similar fashion, though it may be served with allioli sauce.\n\nThe following is a list of other similar rice dishes:\n\n\n\nIn 2015, an emoji for paella was proposed to Unicode. The emoji was approved for Unicode 9.0 as in June 2016. Although it is generally rendered as paella, Samsung has rendered the symbol as a Korean hot pot.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48087", "title": "Embarazada", "text": "Embarazada\n\nEmbarazada () is the Spanish word for pregnant. It is a false friend for native English-speaking students of Spanish who may attempt to say \"I'm embarrassed\" by saying \"\"estoy embarazada\"\". This phrase actually means \"I'm pregnant\" in Spanish. This may be confusing to Spanish speakers who are not familiar with the English word.\n\nThe correct way to say \"I'm embarrassed\" in Spanish is using the phrase \"tengo vergüenza\" (meaning \"I have shame\") or the more formal phrases \"me da vergüenza\" or \"estoy avergonzado/a\". Yet, in Spanish, there also exists the adjective \"embarazoso,\" meaning the same as \"embarrassing\" in its denotation of something that causes a sensation of unease, but not of shame. Complicating the issue further, \"embarazada\" can sometimes also mean \"hampered\", or \"hindered\". This more closely mirrors the original meaning of the English word \"embarrass\".\n\n\"Embarazada\" is a past participle, meaning that it indicates a state resulting from a previous action. In English, past participles usually end in \"-ed\" (e.g., \"destroyed), and \"embarazado\" therefore translates directly into English as \"impregnated\". It is a conjugated form of \"embarazar\" \"to impregnate\". As the word \"embarazado\" is masculine, it is rarely encountered in Spanish. It is more common for the word \"embarazada to be used to describe pregnancy. However, \"embarazado\" can be used as a past participle in perfect tenses, as in: \"El hombre ha embarazado a la mujer.\" (The man has impregnated the woman.)\n\nThe English word \"embarrassed\" is indirectly derived from the Spanish word. The first recorded usage of \"embarrass\" in English was in 1664 by Samuel Pepys in his diary. The word was derived from the French word \"embarrasser\", \"to block\" or \"to obstruct\", or figuratively, \"to put one in a difficult situation\". The first recorded usage was by Michel de Montaigne in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish \"embarazar\", whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in \"Cancionero de Stúñiga\" (Songbook of Stúñiga) by Álvaro de Luna.\n\nThe Spanish word likely comes from the Portuguese \"embaraçar\" (used in the same context of English \"embarrassment\"), which probably is a combination of the prefix \"em-\" (from Latin \"in-\" for \"in-\") with \"baraça\" \"a noose\", or \"rope\", which makes sense with the synonym \"encinta\" (\"on noose, on rope\" because of the old usage of women to wear a strap of cloth on their dresses when pregnant). \"Baraça\" originated before the Romans began their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BCE. Thus, \"baraça\" could be related to the Celtic word \"barr\", \"tuft\". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 700s BCE, the second group of Indo-European language speakers to do so.) However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of \"r\" for \"rr\" in Iberian Romance languages was not a known occurrence.\n\nSome say the Spanish word actually came from the Italian \"imbarazzare\", from \"imbarazzo\", \"obstacle\" or \"obstruction\". That word came from \"imbarrare\", \"to block\" or \"to bar\", which is a combination of \"in-\", \"in\", with \"barra\", \"bar\" (from the Vulgar Latin \"barra\", which is of unknown origin). The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by Bernardo Davanzati (1529-1606), long after the word had entered Spanish. Thus, modern scholars believe that the Italian word actually came from the Spanish one.\n\nWhen Parker Pen entered the Mexican market, its advertisements which claimed that Parker Pens \"won't leak in your pocket and embarrass you\" was mistranslated to \"\"No te embarazará chorreándose en tu bolsillo\"\", which means \"Won't leak in your pocket and impregnate you\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48203", "title": "Article (grammar)", "text": "Article (grammar)\n\nAn article (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation ) is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope.\n\nThe articles in English grammar are \"the\" and \"a/an\", and in certain contexts \"some\". \"An\" and \"a\" are modern forms of the Old English \"an\", which in Anglian dialects was the number \"one\" (compare \"on\" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number \"owan\". Both \"on\" (respelled \"one\" by the Norman language) and \"an\" survived into Modern English, with \"one\" used as the number and \"an\" (\"a\", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.\n\nIn many languages, articles are a special part of speech which with other parts of speech. In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, which contains articles, demonstratives (such as \"this\" and \"that\"), possessive determiners (such as \"my\" and \"his\"), and quantifiers (such as \"all\" and \"few\"). Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.\n\nIn languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain definiteness, definite or indefinite, as an attribute (similar to the way many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number—singular or plural—or a grammatical gender). Articles are among the most common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most frequent word is \"the\".\n\nArticles are usually categorized as either \"definite\" or \"indefinite\". A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type, languages may have various forms of each article, due to conforming to grammatical attributes such as gender, number, or case. Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in elision (e.g., French \"le\" becoming \"l'\" before a vowel), epenthesis (e.g., English \"a\" becoming \"an\" before a vowel), or contraction (e.g. Irish \"i + na\" becoming \"sna\").\n\nThe definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified. There is one definite article in English, for both singular and plural nouns: \"the\":\nThe sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home; it contrasts with the much more general observation that:\nThe latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home. Likewise,\nrefers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener; as such it has a markedly different meaning from \nwhich uses an indefinite article, which does not specify what book is to be given.\n\nThe definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:\nHowever, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.\n\nAn \"indefinite\" article indicates that its noun is not a particular one identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing. \"a/an\" are the indefinite articles used in English. The form \"an\" is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in \"an hour\"), and \"a\" before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if spelled with a vowel, as in \"a European\").\n\nBefore some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) \"h\" in an unstressed first syllable, such as \"historic(al)\", \"hallucination\", \"hilarious\", \"horrendous\", and \"horrific\", some (especially older) British writers prefer to use \"an\" over \"a\" (\"an historical event\", etc.). \"An\" is also preferred before \"hotel\" by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, in which the \"h\" is not pronounced). The use of \"an\" before words beginning with an unstressed \"h\" is more common generally in British English than in American. American writers normally use \"a\" in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of \"an historic(al)\" in American English. According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too. Unlike British English, American English typically uses \"an\" before \"herb\", since the \"h\" in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term \"hereditary peer\" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.\nThe word \"some\" can be viewed as functionally a plural of \"a/an\" in that, for example, \"an apple\" never means more than one apple but \"give me \"some\" apples\" indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity. In this view it is functionally homologous to the Spanish plural indefinite article \"unos/unas\"; \"un/una\" (\"one\") is completely indistinguishable from the unit number, except where it has a plural form (\"unos/unas\"). Thus \"Dame una manzana\" (\"Give me an apple\")\" but \"Dame \"unas\" manzanas\" (\"Give me \"some\" apples\"). The indefiniteness of \"some\" or \"unos\" can sometimes be semiquantitatively narrowed, as in \"There are \"some\" apples there, but not many.\"\n\n\"Some\" also serves as a singular indefinite article, as in \"There is \"some\" person on the porch\".\n\nA proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The Maori language has the proper article \"a\", which is used for personal nouns; so, \"a Pita\" means \"Peter\". In Maori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase \"a Te Rauparaha\", which contains both the proper article \"a\" and the definite article \"Te\" refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.\n\nThe definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there \"is\" just one of them). For example: \"the Amazon, the Hebrides\". In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. \"the Amazon River\", \"the Hebridean Islands\". Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: \"the United States\", \"the People's Republic of China\". This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage \"the Ukraine\" stressed the word's Russian meaning of \"borderlands\"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries: \"la France/le Canada/l'Allemagne, l'Italia/la Spagna/il Brasile\".\n\nSome languages also use definite articles with personal names. For example, such use is standard in Portuguese (\"a Maria\", literally: \"the Maria\"), in Greek (η Μαρία, ο Γιώργος, ο Δούναβης, η Παρασκευή) and in Catalan (la Núria, el/en Oriol). It also occurs colloquially or dialectally in Spanish, German, French, Italian and other languages. In Hungary it is considered to be a Germanism.\n\nRarely, this usage can appear in English. A prominent example is how President of The United States and businessman Donald Trump is known as \"The Donald\", this wording being used by many publications such as \"Newsweek\" and \"New York Post\". Another is US President Ronald Reagan's nickname of \"The Gipper\"; publisher Townhall.com issued an article after Reagan's death titled simply \"Goodbye to 'the Gipper'\".\n\nA partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as \"water\", to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of determiner; they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is \"some\", although the latter is classified as a determiner but not in all authorities' classifications as an indefinite article, and English uses it less than French uses \"de\". \n\nHaida has a partitive article (suffixed \"-gyaa\") referring to \"part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category,\" e.g., \"tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang\" \"he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).\"\n\nA negative article specifies \"none\" of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by \"no\", which can appear before a singular or plural noun: \n\nThe zero article is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner. In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word \"some\" can be used as an indefinite plural article.\n\nArticles are found in many Indo-European languages, Semitic languages (only the definite article), and Polynesian languages, but are formally absent from many of the world's major languages, such as Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, the majority of Slavic and Baltic languages (incl. Russian), Yoruba, and the Bantu languages. In some languages that do have articles, like for example some North Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional but in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.\n\nLinguists believe the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article in Latin or Sanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar) and Baltic languages. Although Classical Greek had a definite article (which has survived into Modern Greek and which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlier Homeric Greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known as Mycenaean Greek did not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families.\n\nNot all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example, French and Italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns, whereas Colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and Macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words \"this\" and \"that\" (and their plurals, \"these\" and \"those\") can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article \"the\" (whose declension in Old English included \"thaes\", an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).\n\nIn many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the gender, number, or case of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as topic–comment constructions.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Grammatically speaking Finnish has no articles, but the words \"se\" (it) and \"yks(i)\" (one) are used in the same fashion as \"the\" and \"a/an\" in English and are, for all intents and purposes, treated like articles when used in this manner in colloquial Finnish. \n\nThe following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:\n\n\nExamples of prefixed definite articles: \n\nA different way, limited to the definite article, is used by Latvian and Lithuanian. \nThe noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian: \"galds\", a table / the table; \"balts galds\", a white table; \"baltais galds\", the white table. In Lithuanian: \"stalas\", a table / the table; \"baltas stalas\", a white table; \"baltasis stalas\", the white table.\n\nLanguages in the above table written in \"italics\" are constructed languages and are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind. They do, however, all belong to language families themselves. Esperanto is derived from European languages and therefore all of its roots are found in Proto-Indo-European and cognates can be found in real-world languages like French, German, Italian and English. Interlingua is also based on European languages but with its main source being that of Italic descendent languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, with German and Russian being secondary sources, with words from further afield (but internationally known and often borrowed) contributing to the language's vocabulary (such as words taken from Japanese, Arabic and Finnish). The result is a supposedly easy-to-learn language for the world. As well as these \"auxiliary\" languages the list contains two more: Quenya and Sindarin; these two languages were created by Professor Tolkien and used in his fictional works. They are not based on any real-world language family (as are Esperanto and Interlingua), but do share a common history with roots in Common Eldarin. \n\nWhen using a definite article in Tokelauan language, unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not to have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific. This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person. So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language is \"te\", it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior. When translating to English, \"te\" could translate to the English definite article \"the\", or it could also translate to the English indefinite article \"a\". An example of how the definite article \"te\" can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence “\"Kua hau te tino\"”. In the English language, this could be translated as “A man has arrived” or “The man has arrived” where using \"te\" as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man. The word \"he\", which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe ‘any such item’. The word \"he\" is used in negative statements because that is where it is most often found, alongside its great use in interrogative statements. Though this is something to make note of, \"he\" is not used in just in negative statements and questions alone. Although these two types of statements are where \"he\" occurs the most, it is also used in other statements as well. An example of the use of \"he\" as an indefinite article is “\"Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki\" ”, where ‘\"he toki\" ’ mean ‘an axe’. The use of \"he\" and \"te\" in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather than \"te\", the article \"nā\" is used. ‘\"Vili ake oi k'aumai nā nofoa\"’ in Tokelauan would translate to “Do run and bring me the chairs” in English. There are some special cases in which instead of using \"nā\", plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by \"0\". One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described. Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite noun \"te\" would is used. In English, ‘\"Ko te povi e kai mutia\"’ means “Cows eat grass”. Because this is a general statement about cows, \"te\" is used instead of \"nā\". The \"ko\" serves as a preposition to the “\"te\"” The article \"ni\" is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. ‘\"E i ei ni tuhi?\"’ translates to “Are there any books?”\n\nArticles have developed independently in many different language families across the globe. Generally, articles develop over time usually by specialization of certain adjectives or determiners, and their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic, perhaps combined with the loss of inflection as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.\n\nJoseph Greenberg in\nUniversals of Human Language\ndescribes \"the cycle of the definite article\": Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.\n\nDefinite articles typically arise from demonstratives meaning \"that\". For example, the definite articles in most Romance languages—e.g., \"el\", \"il\", \"le\", \"la\", \"lo\" — derive from the Latin demonstratives \"ille\" (masculine), \"illa\" (feminine) and \"illud\" (neuter).\n\nThe English definite article \"the\", written \"þe\" in Middle English, derives from an Old English demonstrative, which, according to gender, was written \"se\" (masculine), \"seo\" (feminine) (\"þe\" and \"þeo\" in the Northumbrian dialect), or \"þæt\" (neuter). The neuter form \"þæt\" also gave rise to the modern demonstrative \"that\". The \"ye\" occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as \"Ye Olde Englishe Tea Shoppe\" is actually a form of \"þe\", where the letter thorn (\"þ\") came to be written as a \"y\".\n\nMultiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has \"столот\" (\"stolot\"), the chair; \"столов\" (\"stolov\"), this chair; and \"столон\" (\"stolon\"), that chair. These derive from the Common Slavic demonstratives \"*tъ\" \"this, that\", \"*ovъ\" \"this here\" and \"*onъ\" \"that over there, yonder\" respectively. Colognian prepositions articles such as in \"dat Auto\", or \"et Auto\", the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic.\n\nStandard Basque distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix \"-a-\", etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative \"har-/hai-\") functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix \"-o-\", derived from the proximal demonstrative \"hau-/hon-\") is marked and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): \"etxeak\" (\"the houses\") vs. \"etxeok\" (\"these houses [of ours]\"), \"euskaldunak\" (\"the Basque speakers\") vs. \"euskaldunok\" (\"we, the Basque speakers\").\n\nSpeakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, a modern Aramaic language that lacks a definite article, may at times use demonstratives \"aha\" and \"aya\" (feminine) or \"awa\" (masculine) – which translate to \"this\" and \"that\", respectively – to give the sense of \"the\".\n\nIndefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning \"one\". For example, the indefinite articles in the Romance languages—e.g., \"un\", \"una\", \"une\"—derive from the Latin adjective \"unus\". Partitive articles, however, derive from Vulgar Latin \"de illo\", meaning \"(some) of the\".\n\nThe English indefinite article \"an\" is derived from the same root as \"one\". The \"-n\" came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form \"a\". The existence of both forms has led to many cases of juncture loss, for example transforming the original \"a napron\" into the modern \"an apron\".\n\nThe Persian indefinite article is \"yek\", meaning one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48212", "title": "Ice cream", "text": "Ice cream\n\nIce cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice) is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy, cashew, coconut or almondmilk, and is flavored with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice or fruit. Colourings are usually added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below ). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.\n\nThe meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies from one country to another. Terms such as \"frozen custard,\" \"frozen yogurt,\" \"sorbet,\" \"gelato,\" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled \"frozen dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.\n\nIce cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible cones. Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska.\n\nHistory of ice creams probably began around 500 BC in the Achaemenid Empire with ice combined with flavors to produce summertime treats. In 400 BC, the Persians invented a special chilled food, made of rose water and vermicelli, which was served to royalty during summers. The ice was mixed with saffron, fruits, and various other flavours.\n\nDuring the 5th century BC, ancient Greeks ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. Hippocrates encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice \"\"as it livens the life-juices and increases the well-being.\"\"\n\nA frozen mixture of milk and rice was used in China around 200 BC. \"They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling point of water, it lowers the freezing point to below zero.\"\n\nThe Roman Emperor Nero (37–68 AD) had ice brought from the mountains and combined it with fruit toppings to create chilled delicacies.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, the Mughal emperors from the Indian subcontinent used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to Delhi, where it was used in fruit sorbets. Kulfi is a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent and is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\" It originated in the sixteenth century in the Mughal Empire.\n\nWhen Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici married the Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533, she is said to have brought with her to France some Italian chefs who had recipes for flavoured ices or sorbets. One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the \"frozen snow\" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative. There is no historical evidence to support these legends, which first appeared during the 19th century.\n\nThe first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemery's \"Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature\". Recipes for \"sorbetti\" saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's \"Lo Scalco alla Moderna\" (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in François Massialot's \"Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits\", starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.\n\nIce cream recipes first appeared in England in the 18th century. The recipe for ice cream was published in \"Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts\" in London in 1718.\n\nTo ice cream.\n\nTake Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweeten’d, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you wou’d freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Raspberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweeten’d; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.\nAn early reference to ice cream given by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is from 1744, reprinted in a magazine in 1877. \"1744 in Pennsylvania Mag. Hist. & Biogr. (1877) I. 126 Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.\"\n\nThe 1751 edition of \"The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy\" by Hannah Glasse features a recipe for ice cream. OED gives her recipe: \"H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.\" The year 1768 saw the publication of \"L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office\" by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.\n\nQuaker colonists introduced ice cream to the United States, bringing their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. Records, kept by a merchant from Catham street, New York, show George Washington spending approximately $200 on ice cream in the summer of 1790. The same records show president Thomas Jefferson having an 18 step recipe for ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of U.S. President James Madison, served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.\n\nSmall-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezers were invented in England by Agnes Marshall and in America by Nancy Johnson in the 1840s.\n\nThe most popular flavours of ice cream in North America (based on consumer surveys) are vanilla and chocolate.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to ordinary people by the mid-eighteenth century. Ice cream became popular and inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss émigré Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in 1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice house. Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By 1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale from Norway.\n\nAgnes Marshall, regarded as the \"queen of ices\" in England, did much to popularize ice cream recipes and make its consumption into a fashionable middle-class pursuit. She wrote four books: \"Ices Plain and Fancy: The Book of Ices\" (1885), \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery\" (1888), \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Larger Cookery Book of Extra Recipes\" (1891) and \"Fancy Ices\" (1894) and gave public lectures on cooking. She even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream.\n\nIce cream soda was invented in the 1870s, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to American Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim. The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century.\nThe first mention of the cone being used as an edible receptacle for the ice cream is in \"Mrs. A.B. Marshall's Book of Cookery\" of 1888. Her recipe for \"Cornet with Cream\" said that \"the cornets were made with almonds and baked in the oven, not pressed between irons\". The ice cream cone was popularized in the US at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, MO.\n\nThe history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During the American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.\nIce cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety: Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised \"a world of 28 flavors,” and Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavors (\"one for every day of the month\") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy ( The company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties).\n\nOne important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream, which has more air mixed in, thereby reducing costs. The soft ice cream machine fills a cone or dish from a spigot. In the United States, chains such as Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez helped popularize soft-serve ice cream. Baskin-Robbins would later incorporate it into their menu.\n\nTechnological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, most notably the stabilizing agent gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.\n\nThe 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as \"premium\" and \"super-premium\" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's, Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream Company and Häagen-Dazs.\n\nIce cream is a colloidal emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion which is in the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in fat are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.\n\nBefore the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.\n\nIce cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.\nThe hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.\nIn Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.\n\nThe development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.\n\nIn modern times, a common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method is to use a pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.\n\nBorden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk circulated a recipe for making ice cream at home. It may be made in an ice cube tray with the product, cream, and various simple flavorings. It can be ready to serve after as little as four hours of freezing. Fresh or frozen fruit, nuts, chocolate, and other ingredients may be added as well.\n\nAn unusual method of making ice-cream was done during World War II by American fighter pilots based in the South Pacific. They attached pairs of cans to their aircraft. The cans were fitted with a small propeller, this was spun by the slipstream and drove a stirrer, which agitated the mixture while the intense cold of high altitude froze it. B-17 crews in Europe did something similar on their bombing runs as did others.\n\nIce cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In 2015, US produced nearly 900 million gallons of ice cream.\n\nToday, jobs specialize in the selling of ice cream. The title of a person who works in this speciality is often called an 'ice cream man', however women also specialize in the selling of ice cream. People in this line of work often sell ice cream on beaches. On beaches, ice cream is either sold by a person who carries a box full of ice cream and is called over by people who want the purchase ice cream, or by a person who drives up to the top of the beach and rings a bell. In the second method, people go up to the top of the beach and purchase ice cream straight from the ice cream seller, who is often in an ice cream van. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers.\n\nSome ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from traveling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as \"ice cream trucks\"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music or folk melodies (such as \"Turkey in the Straw\"). The driver of an ice cream van drives throughout neighborhoods and stops every so often, usually every block. The seller on the ice cream van sells the ice cream through a large window; this window is also where the customer asks for ice cream and pays. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.\n\nIn the U.S., ice cream must have the following composition:\nThese compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant.\nEven the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains per half-cup due to its high sugar content.\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, ice cream in Canada must be at least 10 percent milk fat, and must contain at least 180 grams of solids per liter. When cocoa, chocolate syrup, fruit, nuts, or confections are added, the percentage of milk fat can be 8 percent.\n\nIce cream is considered as a colloidal system. It is composed by ice cream crystals and aggregates, air that does not mix with the ice cream by forming small bubbles in the bulk and partially coalesced fat globules. This dispersed phase made from all the small particles is surrounded by an unfrozen continuous phase composed by sugars, proteins, salts, polysaccharides and water. Their interactions determine the properties of ice cream, whether soft and whippy or hard.\n\nOstwald ripening is the explanation for the growth of large crystals at the expense of small ones in the dispersion phase. This process is also called migratory recrystallization. It involves the formation of sharp crystals. Theories about Ostwald recrystallization admit that after a period of time, the recrystallization process can be described by the following equation:\n\nr = r (0) + Rt exp(1/n)\n\nWhere r (0) is the initial size, n the order of recrystallization, t a time constant for recrystallization that depends on the rate R (in units of size/ time).\n\nTo make ice cream smooth, recrystallization must occur as slowly as possible, because small crystals create smoothness, meaning that r must decrease.\n\nAround the world, different cultures have developed unique versions of ice cream, suiting the product to local tastes and preferences.\nThe most traditional Argentine \"helado\" (ice cream) is very similar to Italian gelato, in large part due to the historical influence of Italian immigrants on Argentinian customs.\n\nPer capita, Australians and New Zealanders are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the United States where people eat 23 litres each per year.\n\nIn China, besides the popular flavours such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers have also introduced other traditional Chinese flavours such as black sesame and red bean.\nIn 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream café in Paris, and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafés opened in Paris.\n\nIn Greece, ice cream in its modern form, or \"pagotó\" (), was introduced in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIndia is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically.\n\nIn Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called \"es puter\" or \"stirred ice cream\" is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar—and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.\n\nIn Iran, \"fālūde\" (Persian: فالوده) or \"pālūde\" (Persian: پالوده) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles, frozen with sugar syrup and rose water. The dessert is often served with lime juice and sometimes ground pistachios.\n\nItalian ice cream, or \"gelato\" as it is known, is a traditional and a popular dessert in Italy. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in \"produzione propria\" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7–8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%.\n\n\"Sorbetes\" is a Philippine version for common ice cream usually peddled from carts by peddlers who roam streets in the Philippines. Despite the similarities between the name \"sorbetes\" and \"sorbet\", sorbetes is not a type of sorbet.\n\nIn Spain, ice cream is often in the style of Italian gelato. Spanish gelato can be found in many cafes or specialty ice cream stores. While many traditional flavours are sold, cafes may also sell unique flavours like nata, crema catalana, or tiramisu.\n\n\"Dondurma\" is the name given to ice cream in Turkey. Dondurma typically includes milk, sugar, salep, and mastic.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth £1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).\n\nIn the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as \"Philadelphia style\" ice cream. Ice cream that uses eggs to make a custard is sometimes called \"French ice cream\". American federal labeling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% milk fat. Americans consume about 23 liters of ice cream per person per year — the most in the world.\n\n\"Mrs Marshall's Cookery Book,\" published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones, but the idea predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularise ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.\n\nReliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, an ice cream vendor at the fair ran out of cardboard dishes. The vendor at the Syrian waffle booth next door, unsuccessful in the intense heat, offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles. The new product sold well and was widely copied by other vendors.\n\nThe following is a partial list of ice cream-like frozen desserts and snacks:\n\n\nIn 2006, some commercial ice cream makers began to use liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, thus eliminating the need for a conventional ice cream freezer. Brands are Dippin' Dots. The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapour cloud. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still \"steaming\" with liquid nitrogen, is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vapourised. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw. Good results can also be achieved with the more readily available dry ice, and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.\n\nAnother vendor, \"Creamistry\", creates ice cream from liquid ingredients as customers watch. It has a softer texture than regular ice cream, because ice crystals have less time to form.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49592", "title": "Fortune cookie", "text": "Fortune cookie\n\nA fortune cookie is a crisp and sugary cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil with a piece of paper inside, a \"fortune\", on which is an aphorism, or a vague prophecy. The message inside may also include a Chinese phrase with translation and/or a list of lucky numbers used by some as lottery numbers; since relatively few distinct messages are printed, in the recorded case where winning numbers happened to be printed, the lottery had an unexpectedly high number of winners sharing a prize. Fortune cookies are often served as a dessert in Chinese restaurants in the United States and other Western countries, but are not a tradition in China. The exact origin of fortune cookies is unclear, though various immigrant groups in California claim to have popularized them in the early 20th century. They most likely originated from cookies made by Japanese immigrants to the United States in the late 19th or early 20th century. The Japanese version did not have the Chinese lucky numbers and was eaten with tea.\n\nAs far back as the 19th century, a cookie very similar in appearance to the modern fortune cookie was made in Kyoto, Japan; and there is a Japanese temple tradition of random fortunes, called omikuji. The Japanese version of the cookie differs in several ways: they are a little bit larger; are made of darker dough; and their batter contains sesame and miso rather than vanilla and butter. They contain a fortune; however, the small slip of paper was wedged into the bend of the cookie rather than placed inside the hollow portion. This kind of cookie is called and is still sold in some regions of Japan, especially in Kanazawa, Ishikawa. It is also sold in the neighborhood of Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine in Kyoto.\n\nMakoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the U.S. to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo.\n\nDavid Jung, founder of the Hong Kong Noodle Company in Los Angeles, has made a competing claim that he invented the cookie in 1918. San Francisco's Court of Historical Review attempted to settle the dispute in 1983. During the proceedings, a fortune cookie was introduced as a key piece of evidence with a message reading, \"S.F. Judge who rules for L.A. Not Very Smart Cookie\". A federal judge of the Court of Historical Review determined that the cookie originated with Hagiwara and the court ruled in favor of San Francisco. Subsequently, the city of Los Angeles condemned the decision.\n\nSeiichi Kito, the founder of Fugetsu-do of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, also claims to have invented the cookie. Kito claims to have gotten the idea of putting a message in a cookie from Omikuji (fortune slip) which are sold at temples and shrines in Japan. According to his story, he sold his cookies to Chinese restaurants where they were greeted with much enthusiasm in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. Thus Kito's main claim is that he is responsible for the cookie being so strongly associated with Chinese restaurants.\n\nUp to around World War II, fortune cookies were known as \"fortune tea cakes\"—likely reflecting their origins in Japanese tea cakes.\n\nFortune cookies moved from being a confection dominated by Japanese-Americans to one dominated by Chinese-Americans sometime around World War II. One theory for why this occurred is because of the Japanese American internment during World War II, which forcibly put over 100,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps, including those who had produced fortune cookies. This gave an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers.\nFortune cookies before the early 20th century were all made by hand. However, the fortune cookie industry changed dramatically after the fortune cookie machine was invented by Shuck Yee from Oakland, California. The machine allowed for mass production of fortune cookies which subsequently allowed the cookies to drop in price to become the novelty and courtesy dessert many Americans are familiar with after their meals at most Chinese restaurants today.\n\nRumors that fortune cookies were invented in China are seen as false. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\". Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\".\n\nThere are approximately 3 billion fortune cookies made each year around the world, the vast majority of them used for consumption in the United States. The largest manufacturer of the cookies is Wonton Food Inc., headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. They make over 4.5 million fortune cookies per day. Another large manufacturer are Baily International in the Midwest and Peking Noodle in the Los Angeles area. There are other smaller, local manufacturers including Tsue Chong Co. in Seattle, Keefer Court Food in Minneapolis and Sunrise Fortune Cookie in Philadelphia. Many smaller companies will also sell custom fortunes.\n\nAuthorities briefly investigated Wonton Food Inc. in 2005, after 110 Powerball lottery players won about $19 million after using the \"lucky numbers\" on the back of fortunes.\n\nManufacturing processes vary between plants but they generally follow the same procedure. The ingredients (typically made with a base of flour, sugar, vanilla, and sesame seed oil) are mixed in a large tank and squirted onto fast moving trays. These function like a conveyor belt and are heated to cook the dough. Cookies are compressed with round hot plates to shape and cook them. The cookies bake for approximately one minute and are reshaped. They can be mechanically shaped or folded by hand. When automated, a machine folds the cookie into the right orientation with the fortune inside. Cooled and hardened cookies are sealed in plastic wrappers, which are then inspected before being sent to be served.\n\nFortune cookies are used for marketing. For example, the film \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" was promoted by putting quotes from the protagonist of the film on fortune cookie slips. Lotteries have also been advertised by suggesting lottery number picks on fortune cookie slips.\n\nCookies from different manufacturers have somewhat different nutritional content. One cookie is around 20-30 calories and 5-7 grams of total carbohydrates per cookie. Most cookies contain around 3 grams of sugar, but some have no sugar. They can have between 8 milligrams and 2 milligrams of sodium, and may contain significant (compared to their size) amounts of iron or protein. Their small size means they have little nutritional value overall.\n\nFortune cookies, while largely an American item, have been served in Chinese restaurants in Brazil, Canada, France, India, Italy, Mexico, United Kingdom, as well as other countries. In Peru, they are served in the chifas, Chinese-Peruvian fusion food restaurants.\n\nThere are also multi-cultural versions of the fortune cookie. For instance, the Mexican version of the fortune cookie is called the \"Lucky Taco\", it is a red taco-shaped cookie with a fortune inside.\n\nThere is also an Italian version called the \"Lucky Canoli\".\n\nThe fortune cookie, although thought to be Chinese, is actually Japanese. The original cookie is cooked with a darker batter and is seasoned with miso and topped with sesame seeds.\n\nFortune cookies are sometimes viewed as a stereotype of East Asians by Westerners. \"I think it does go to what people think when they think of Asians. They think of food. Because that is really their only point of contact, or awareness, with the Asian-American community,\" says Andrew Kang, senior staff attorney at the Asian-American Institute in Chicago. The Asian American Journalists Association discourages associating ethnic foods with Asian Americans in news coverage.\n\nGlobally, the cookies are generally called by the English term \"fortune cookies\", being American in origin.\n\nThere is no single accepted Chinese name for the cookies, with a large variety of translations being used to describe them in the Chinese language, all of which being more-or-less literal translations of the English \"fortune cookie\". Examples include: 幸运籤饼 \"xìngyùn qiān bǐng\" \"good luck lot cookie\", 籤语饼 \"qiān yǔ bǐng\" \"fortune words cookie\", 幸运饼 \"xìngyùn bǐng\" \"good luck cookie\", 幸运籤语饼 \"xìngyùn qiān yǔ bǐng\" \"lucky fortune words cookie\", 幸运甜饼 \"xìngyùn tián bǐng\" \"good luck sweet cookie\", 幸福饼干 \"xìngfú bǐnggān\" \"good luck biscuit\", or 占卜饼 \"zhānbǔ bǐng\" \"divining cookie\".\n\nThe non-Chinese origin of the fortune cookie is humorously illustrated in Amy Tan's 1989 novel \"The Joy Luck Club\", in which a pair of immigrant women from China find jobs at a fortune cookie factory in America. They are amused by the unfamiliar concept of a fortune cookie but, after several hilarious attempts at translating the fortunes into Chinese, come to the conclusion that the cookies contain not wisdom but \"bad instruction\".\n\nFortune cookies have become an iconic symbol in American culture, inspiring many products. There are fortune cookie-shaped jewelry, a fortune cookie-shaped Magic 8 Ball, and silver-plated fortune cookies. Fortune cookie toilet paper, with words of wisdom that appear when the paper is moistened, has become popular among university students in Italy and Greece.\n\nThere is a common joke in the United States involving fortune cookies that involves appending \"between the sheets\" or \"[except] in bed\" to the end of the fortune, usually creating a sexual innuendo or other bizarre messages (e.g., \"Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising every time we fall [in bed]\"). A gallows humor variation to this joke involves appending the phrase \"in jail\" to the end of the fortune.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49723", "title": "Reserved word", "text": "Reserved word\n\nIn a computer language, a reserved word (also known as a reserved identifier) is a word that cannot be used as an identifier, such as the name of a variable, function, or label – it is \"reserved from use\". This is a syntactic definition, and a reserved word may have no meaning.\n\nA closely related and often conflated notion is a keyword, which is a word with special meaning in a particular context. This is a semantic definition. By contrast, names in a standard library but not built into the language are not considered reserved words or keywords. The terms \"reserved word\" and \"keyword\" are often used interchangeably – one may say that a reserved word is \"reserved for use as a keyword\" – and formal use varies from language to language; for this article we distinguish as above.\n\nIn general reserved words and keywords need not coincide, but in most modern languages keywords are a subset of reserved words, as this makes parsing easier, since keywords cannot be confused with identifiers. In some languages, like C or Python, reserved words and keywords coincide, while in other languages, like Java, all keywords are reserved words, but some reserved words are not keywords – these are \"reserved for future use\". In yet other languages, such as the older languages ALGOL, FORTRAN and PL/I, there are keywords but no reserved words, with keywords being distinguished from identifiers by other means. This makes parsing more difficult with look-ahead parsers necessary.\n\nThe sets of reserved words and keywords in a language often coincide or are almost equal, and the distinction is subtle, so the terms are often used interchangeably. However, in careful usage they are distinguished.\n\nMaking keywords be reserved words makes lexing easier, as a string of characters will unambiguously be either a keyword or an identifier, without depending on context; thus keywords are usually a subset of reserved words. However, reserved words need not be keywords – for example, in Java, codice_1 is a reserved word, but has no meaning and does not appear in any production rules in the grammar. This is usually done for forward compatibility, so a reserved word may become a keyword in a future version without breaking existing programs.\n\nConversely, keywords need not be reserved words, with their role understood from context, or they may be distinguished in another manner, such as by stropping. For example, the phrase codice_2 is unambiguous in most grammars, since a control statement of an if clause cannot start with an codice_3, and thus is allowed in some languages, such as FORTRAN. Alternatively, in ALGOL 68, keywords must be stropped – marked in some way to distinguished – in the strict language by listing in bold, and thus are not reserved words. Thus in the strict language the following expression is legal, as the bold keyword if does not conflict with the ordinary identifier codice_4:\nHowever, in ALGOL 68 there is also a stropping regime in which keywords are reserved words, an example of how these distinct concepts often coincide; this is followed in many modern languages.\n\nA reserved word is one that \"looks like\" a normal word, but is not allowed to be used as a normal word. Formally this means that it satisfies the usual lexical syntax (syntax of words) of identifiers – for example, being a sequence of letters – but cannot be used where identifiers are used. For example, the word codice_4 is commonly a reserved word, while codice_6 generally is not, so codice_7 is a valid assignment, but codice_2 is not.\n\nKeywords have varied uses, but primarily fall into a few classes: part of the phrase grammar (specifically a production rule with nonterminal symbols), with various meanings, often being used for control flow, such as the word codice_4 in most procedural languages, which indicates a conditional and takes clauses (the nonterminal symbols); names of primitive types in a language that support a type system, such as codice_10; primitive literal values such as codice_11 for Boolean true; or sometimes special commands like codice_12. Other uses of keywords in phrases are for input/output, such as codice_13.\n\nThe distinct definitions are clear when a language is analyzed by a combination of a lexer and a parser, and the syntax of the language is generated by a lexical grammar for the words, and a context-free grammar of production rules for the phrases. This is common in analyzing modern languages, and in this case keywords are a subset of reserved words, as they must be distinguished from identifiers at the word level (hence reserved words) to be syntactically analyzed differently at the phrase level (as keywords).\n\nIn this case reserved words are defined as part of the lexical grammar, and are each tokenized as a separate type, distinct from identifiers. In conventional notation, the reserved words codice_4 and codice_15 for example are tokenized as types codice_16 and codice_17, respectively, while codice_6 and codice_19 are both tokenized as type codice_20.\n\nKeywords, by contrast, syntactically appear in the phrase grammar, as terminal symbols. For example, the production rule for a conditional expression may be codice_21. In this case codice_16 and codice_17 are terminal symbols, meaning \"a token of type codice_16 or codice_17, respectively\" – and due to the lexical grammar, this means the string codice_4 or codice_15 in the original source. As an example of a primitive constant value, codice_11 may be a keyword representing the boolean value \"true\", in which case it should appear in the grammar as a possible expansion of the production codice_29, for instance.\n\nBeyond reserving specific lists of words, some languages reserve entire ranges of words, for use as private spaces for future language version, different dialects, compiler vendor-specific extensions, or for internal use by a compiler, notably in name mangling.\n\nThis is most often done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 reserves identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere – this allows the use of a double underscore as a separator (to connect user identifiers), for instance.\n\nThe frequent use of a double underscores in internal identifiers in Python gave rise to the abbreviation \"dunder;\" this was coined by Mark Jackson and independently by Tim Hochberg, within minutes of each other, both in reply to the same question in 2002.\n\nThe list of reserved words and keywords in a language are defined when a language is developed, and both form part of a language's formal specification. Generally one wishes to minimize the number of reserved words, to avoid restricting valid identifier names. Further, introducing new reserved words breaks existing programs that use that word (it is not backwards compatible), so this is avoided. To prevent this and provide forward compatibility, sometimes words are reserved without having a current use (a reserved word that is not a keyword), as this allows the word to be used in future without breaking existing programs. Alternatively, new language features can be implemented as predefineds, which can be overridden, thus not breaking existing programs.\n\nReasons for flexibility include allowing compiler vendors to extend the specification by including non-standard features, different standard dialects of language to extend it, or future versions of the language to include additional features. For example, a procedural language may anticipate adding object-oriented capabilities in a future version or some dialect, at which point one might add keywords like codice_30 or codice_31. To accommodate this possibility, the current specification may make these reserved words, even if they are not currently used.\n\nA notable example is in Java, where codice_32 and codice_1 are reserved words — they have no meaning in Java but they also cannot be used as identifiers. By reserving the terms, they can be implemented in future versions of Java, if desired, without breaking older Java source code. For example, there was a proposal in 1999 to add C++-like codice_32 to the language, which was possible using the codice_32 word, since it was reserved but currently unused; however, this proposal was rejected – notably because even though adding the feature would not break any existing programs, using it in the standard library (notably in collections) \"would\" break compatibility. JavaScript also contains a number of reserved words without special functionality; the exact list varies by version and mode.\n\nLanguages differ significantly in how frequently they introduce new reserved words or keywords and how they name them, with some languages being very conservative and introducing new keywords rarely or never, to avoid breaking existing programs, while other languages introduce new keywords more freely, requiring existing programs to change existing identifiers that conflict. A case study is given by new keywords in C11 compared with C++11, both from 2011 – recall that in C and C++, identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter are reserved:\n\nThat is, C11 introduced the keyword codice_36 within an existing set of reserved words (those with a certain prefix), and then used a separate facility (macro processing) to allow its use as if it were a new keyword without any prefixing, while C++11 introduce the keyword codice_37 despite this not being an existing reserved word, breaking any programs that used this, but without requiring macro processing.\n\nA related notion to reserved words are predefined functions, methods, subroutines, or variables, particularly library routines from the standard library. These are similar in that they are part of the basic language, and may be used for similar purposes. However, these differ in that the name of a predefined function, method, or subroutine is typically categorized as an identifier instead of a reserved word, and is not treated specially in the syntactic analysis. Further, reserved words may not be redefined by the programmer, but predefineds can often be overridden in some capacity.\n\nLanguages vary as to what is provided as a keyword and what is a predefined. Some languages, for instance, provide keywords for input/output operations whereas in others these are library routines. In Python (versions earlier than 3.0) and many BASIC dialects, codice_13 is a keyword. In contrast, the C, Lisp, and Python 3.0 equivalents codice_39, codice_40, and codice_13 are functions in the standard library. Similarly, in Python prior to 3.0, codice_42, codice_43, and codice_44 were predefined variables, but not reserved words, but in Python 3.0 they were made into reserved words.\n\nSome use the terms \"keyword\" and \"reserved word\" interchangeably, while others distinguish usage, say by using \"keyword\" to mean a word that is special only in certain contexts but \"reserved word\" to mean a special word that cannot be used as a user-defined name. The meaning of keywords — and, indeed, the meaning of the notion of \"keyword\" — differs widely from language to language. Concretely, in ALGOL 68, keywords are stropped (in the strict language, written in bold) and are not reserved words – the unstropped word can be used as an ordinary identifier.\n\nThe \"Java Language Specification\" uses the term \"keyword\". The ISO 9899 standard for the C programming language uses the term \"keyword\".\n\nIn many languages, such as C and similar environments like C++, a \"keyword\" is a reserved word which identifies a syntactic form. Words used in control flow constructs, such as if, codice_15, and codice_46 are keywords. In these languages, keywords cannot also be used as the names of variables or functions.\n\nIn some languages, such as ALGOL and Algol 68, keywords cannot be written verbatim, but must be stropped. This means that keywords must be marked somehow. E.g. by quoting them or by prefixing them by a special character. As a consequence, keywords are not reserved words, and thus the same word can be used for as a normal identifier. However, one stropping regime was to not strope the keywords, and instead have them simply be reserved words.\n\nSome languages, such as PostScript, are extremely liberal in this approach, allowing core keywords to be redefined for specific purposes.\n\nIn Common Lisp, the term \"keyword\" (or \"keyword symbol\") is used for a special sort of symbol, or identifier. Unlike other symbols, which usually stand for variables or functions, keywords are self-quoting and self-evaluating and are interned in the KEYWORD package. Keywords are usually used to label named arguments to functions, and to represent symbolic values. The symbols which name functions, variables, special forms and macros in the package named COMMON-LISP are basically reserved words. The effect of redefining them is undefined in ANSI Common Lisp. Binding them is possible. For instance the expression codice_47 is possible, when codice_4 is a local variable. The leftmost codice_4 refers to the codice_4 operator; the remaining symbols are interpreted as variable names. Since there is a separate namespace for functions and variables, codice_4 could be a local variable. In Common Lisp, however, there are two special symbols which are not in the keyword package: the symbols codice_52 and codice_53. When evaluated as expressions, they evaluate to themselves. They cannot be used as the names of functions or variables, so are de facto reserved. codice_54 is a well-formed expression, but the codice_55 operator will not permit the usage.\n\nTypically, when a programmer attempts to use a keyword for a variable or function name, a compilation error will be triggered. In most modern editors, the keywords are automatically set to have a particular text colour to remind or inform the programmers that they are keywords.\n\nIn languages with macros or lazy evaluation, control flow constructs such as codice_4 can be implemented as macros or functions. In languages without these expressive features, they are generally keywords.\n\nNot all languages have the same numbers of reserved words. For example, Java (and other C derivatives) has a rather sparse complement of reserved words—approximately 50 – whereas COBOL has approximately 400. At the other end of the spectrum, pure Prolog and PL/I have none at all.\n\nThe number of reserved words in a language has little to do with how “powerful” a language is. COBOL was designed in the 1950s as a business language and was made to be self-documenting using English-like structural elements such as verbs, clauses, sentences, sections and divisions. C, on the other hand, was written to be very terse (syntactically) and to get more text on the screen. For example, compare the equivalent blocks of code from C and COBOL to calculate weekly earnings:\n\nPure Prolog logic is expressed in terms of relations, and execution is triggered by running queries over these relations. Constructs such as loops are implemented using recursive relationships.\n\nAll three of these languages can solve the same types of “problems” even though they have differing numbers of reserved words. This “power” relates to their belonging to the set of Turing-complete languages.\n\nDefinition of reserved words in a language raises problems. The language may be difficult for new users to learn because of a long list of reserved words to memorize which can't be used as identifiers. It may be difficult to extend the language because addition of reserved words for new features might invalidate existing programs or, conversely, \"overloading\" of existing reserved words with new meanings can be confusing. Porting programs can be problematic because a word not reserved by one system/compiler might be reserved by another.\n\nMicrosoft’s .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) specification allows code written in 40+ different programming languages to be combined together into a final product. Because of this, identifier/reserved word collisions can occur when code implemented in one language tries to execute code written in another language. For example, a Visual Basic.NET library may contain a class definition such as:\n' Class Definition of This in Visual Basic.NET:\n\nPublic Class this\nEnd Class\nIf this is compiled and distributed as part of a toolbox, a C# programmer, wishing to define a variable of type “codice_57” would encounter a problem: codice_58 is a reserved word in C#. Thus, the following will not compile in C#:\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\nthis x = new this(); // Won't compile!\nA similar issue arises when accessing members, overriding virtual methods, and identifying namespaces.\n\nThis is resolved by stropping. In order to work around this issue, the specification allows the programmer to (in C#) place the at-sign before the identifier which forces it to be considered an identifier rather than a reserved word by the compiler:\n// Using This Class in C#:\n\n@this x = new @this(); // Will compile! \nFor consistency, this usage is also permitted in non-public settings such as local variables, parameter names, and private members.\n\n\n"}

An item is not a gift if that item is already owned by the one to whom it is given. Although gift-giving might involve an expectation of reciprocity, a gift is meant to be free. In many countries, the act of mutually exchanging money, goods, etc. may sustain social relations and contribute to social cohesion. Economists have elaborated the economics of gift-giving into the notion of a gift economy. By extension the term \"gift\" can refer to any item or act of service that makes the other happier or less sad, especially as a favor, including forgiveness and kindness. Gifts are also first and foremost presented on occasions such as birthdays and holidays.\n\nIn many cultures gifts are traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, gifts are often wrapped in wrapping paper and accompanied by a gift note which may note the occasion, the recipient's name and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive gifts are common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous gifts are considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.\n\nGift-giving occasions may be:\n\nPromotional gifts vary from the normal gifts. The recipients of the gifts may be either employee of a company or the clients. Promotional gifts are mainly used for advertising purposes. They are used to promote the brand name and increase its awareness among the people. In promotional gifting procedures, the quality and presentation of the gifts hold more value than the gifts itself since it will act as a gateway to acquire new clients or associates.\n\nGiving a gift to someone is not necessarily just an altruistic act. It may be given in the hope that the receiver reciprocates in a particular way. It may take the form of positive reinforcement as a reward for compliance, possibly for an underhand manipulative and abusive purpose.\n\nA significant fraction of gifts are unwanted, or the giver pays more for the item than the recipient values it, resulting in a misallocation of economic resources known as a deadweight loss. Unwanted gifts are often regifted, donated to charity, or thrown away. A gift that actually imposes a burden on the recipient, either due to maintenance or storage or disposal costs, is known as a white elephant. \n\nOne means of reducing the mismatch between the buyer and receivers' tastes is advance coordination, often undertaken in the form of a wedding registry or Christmas list. Wedding registries in particular are often kept at a single store, which can designate the exact items to be purchased (resulting in matching housewares), and to coordinate purchases so the same gift is not purchased by different guests. One study found that wedding guests who departed from the registry typically did so because they wished to signal a closer relationship to the couple by personalizing a gift, and also found that as a result of not abiding by the recipients' preferences, their gifts were appreciated less often.\n\nAn estimated $3.4 billion was spent on unwanted Christmas gifts in the United States in 2017. The day after Christmas is typically the busiest day for returns in countries with large Christmas gift giving traditions. The total unredeemed value of gift cards purchased in the U.S. each year is estimated to be about a billion dollars.\n\nAt common law, for a gift to have legal effect, it was required that there be (1) intent by the donor to give a gift, and (2) delivery to the recipient of the item to be given as a gift.\n\nIn some countries, certain types of gifts above a certain monetary amount are subject to taxation. For the United States, see Gift tax in the United States.\n\nIn some contexts, gift giving can be construed as bribery. This tends to occur in situations where the gift is given with an implicit or explicit agreement between the giver of the gift and its receiver that some type of service will be rendered (often outside of normal legitimate methods) because of the gift. Some groups, such as government workers, may have strict rules concerning gift giving and receiving so as to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\n\nLewis Hyde claims in \"The Gift\" that Christianity considers the Incarnation and subsequent death of Jesus to be the greatest gift to humankind, and that the Jataka contains a tale of the Buddha in his incarnation as the Wise Hare giving the ultimate alms by offering himself up as a meal for Sakka. (Hyde, 1983, 58-60)\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, the bread and wine that are consecrated during the Divine Liturgy are referred to as \"the Gifts.\" They are first of all the gifts of the community (both individually and corporately) to God, and then, after the epiklesis, the Gifts of the Body and Blood of Christ to the Church.\n\nRitual sacrifices can be seen as return gifts to a deity.\n\n"}
{"id": "50527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50527", "title": "Enchilada", "text": "Enchilada\n\nAn enchilada (, ) is a corn tortilla rolled around a filling and covered with a chili pepper sauce. Enchiladas can be filled with a variety of ingredients, including various meats, cheese, beans, potatoes, vegetables or combinations. Originating in Mexico, enchiladas are a popular dish throughout Mexico and the American Southwest.\n\nThe Real Academia Española defines the word \"enchilada\", as used in Mexico, as a rolled maize tortilla stuffed with meat and covered with a tomato and chili sauce. \"Enchilada\" is the past participle of Spanish \"enchilar\", \"to add chili pepper to\", literally to \"season (or decorate) with chili\".\n\nThe idiomatic American English phrase \"the whole enchilada\" means \"the whole thing\".\n\nEnchiladas originated in Mexico, where the practice of rolling tortillas around other food dates back at least to Mayan times. The people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate corn tortillas folded or rolled around small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented a feast enjoyed by Europeans hosted by Hernán Cortés in Coyoacán, which included foods served in corn tortillas. (Note that the native Nahuatl name for the flat corn bread used was \"tlaxcalli\"; the Spanish gave it the name \"tortilla\".) The Nahuatl word for enchilada is \"chīllapītzalli\" which is formed of the Nahuatl word for \"chili\", \"chīlli\" and the Nahuatl word for \"flute\", \"tlapītzalli\" . In the 19th century, as Mexican cuisine was being memorialized, enchiladas were mentioned in the first Mexican cookbook, \"El cocinero mexicano\" (\"\"The Mexican Chef\"\"), published in 1831, and in Mariano Galvan Rivera's \"Diccionario de Cocina\", published in 1845.\n\nMexican cooking authority Diana Kennedy cites an early reference from an American traveler from 1883 who remarked, \"Enchiladas, a greasy tortilla sandwich containing chiles and a number of other uninviting looking compounds and other nasty messes, are sold everywhere, filling the air with a pungent, nauseous smell.\" Kennedy goes on to heartily disagree with that characterization, likely brought on by culture shock. Another early mention, in English, is a 1914 recipe found in \"California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook\", by Bertha Haffner Ginger.\n\nIn their original form as Mexican street food, enchiladas were simply corn tortillas dipped in chili sauce and eaten without fillings. There are now many varieties, which are distinguished primarily by their sauces, fillings and, in one instance, by their form. Various adjectives may be used to describe the recipe content or origin, e.g. \"enchilada tapatia\" would be a recipe from Jalisco.\n\nVarieties include:\n\n\n\nFillings include meat (e.g. beef, poultry, pork, seafood) or cheese, potatoes, vegetables, beans and any combination of these. Enchiladas are commonly topped or garnished with cheese, sour cream, lettuce, olives, chopped onions, chili peppers, salsa, or fresh cilantro.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51974", "title": "Mountain Dew", "text": "Mountain Dew\n\nMountain Dew (stylized as Mtn Dew) is a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo. The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia. William H. \"Bill\" Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961. In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada.\n\nBetween the 1940s and 1980s there was one variety of Mountain Dew, which was citrus-flavored and caffeinated in most markets. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988, followed by Mountain Dew Red, which was introduced and discontinued in 1988. In 2001, a cherry flavor called Code Red debuted. This product line extension trend has continued, with expansion into specialty, limited time production, region-specific, and retailer-specific (Taco Bell, 7-Eleven) variations of Mountain Dew.\n\nProduction was extended to the UK in 1996, but was phased out in 1998. A similarly named but different-tasting product has been sold in the UK under the name \"Mountain Dew Energy\" since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011. The product was renamed in 2014 to simply 'Mountain Dew'. As of 2017, Mountain Dew represented a 6.6% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the US. Its competition includes The Coca-Cola Company's Mello Yello and Surge, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's Sun Drop; Mountain Dew accounts for 80% of citrus soft drinks sold within the US.\n\nTennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed Mountain Dew as a mixer in the 1940s. Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s, and the Hartmans had difficulty in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor, preferably whiskey, so the two developed their own. Originally a 19th century generic term for whiskey, especially Highland Scotch whiskey, the Mountain Dew name was trademarked for the soft drink in 1948.\n\nCharles Gordon, who had partnered with William Swartz to bottle and promote Dr. Enuf, was introduced to Mountain Dew when he met the Hartman brothers on a train and they offered him a sample. Gordon and the Hartman brothers subsequently made a deal to bottle Mountain Dew by the Tri-Cities Beverage Corporation in Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\nThe Hartman brothers also asked Coca-Cola for input on their soda. The Coca-Cola Company refused their offer.\n\nThe Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia bought the rights to Mountain Dew, revising the flavor and launching it in 1961. In 1964, Pepsico purchased the Tip Corporation and thus acquired the rights to Mountain Dew. In 1999, the Virginia legislature recognized Bill Jones and the Town of Marion for their role in the history of Mountain Dew.\n\n\"Mountain Dew\" was originally Southern and/or Scots/Irish slang for moonshine (i.e., homemade whiskey). Using it as the name for the soda was originally suggested by Carl E. Retzke at an Owens-Illinois Inc. meeting in Toledo, Ohio, and was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s. Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a cartoon-stylized hillbilly. The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto, and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage.\n\nPepsiCo (then The Pepsi-Cola Company) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964, and shortly thereafter in 1969 the logo was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a \"younger, outdoorsy\" generation. This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s, 1980s, and then was retired in 1996 when another logo took its place for the next three years. Later updates to the logo were made in 1998 and then again in 2005. In October 2008, the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to \"\"Mtn Dew\"\" within the U.S. market, as a result of PepsiCo announcing that it would rebrand its core carbonated soft-drink products by early 2009. However, the variant flavors continued to use the previous design until May 2011, when it was announced that the \"Code Red\", \"LiveWire\", \"Voltage\", and \"Baja Blast\" flavor variants would be given redesigned packaging, including new logos to correspond with the \"Mtn Dew\" style. The returning flavors \"Pitch Black\", \"Supernova\", \"Typhoon\", and \"Game Fuel\" were given redesigned packaging and logos for their 2011 re-release.\n\nIn summer 2010, a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some US shelves. Designed by 4sight, a design and innovation firm, these bottles featured a sleeker design, smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. The bottles were dubbed \"Sidekick bottles\" and were tested in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana markets.\n\nIn its primary market of the United States, the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as: \"carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup (in much of the U.S.), concentrated orange juice, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, erythorbic acid, gum arabic, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, brominated vegetable oil, and yellow 5.\" The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in Canada, the sweetener listed is \"glucose-fructose\" (another name for high-fructose corn syrup), and until 2012, it was caffeine-free by default. Brominated vegetable oil, which is found in about 10% of all citrus-flavored soda drinks in the US, is banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan.\n\nIn response to negative publicity around high-fructose corn syrup, PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited-run production of Mountain Dew Throwback, a variation consisting of sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup. Mountain Dew Throwback subsequently was re-released for brief periods (generally 8–12 weeks at a time), including a second wave from December 2009 to February 2010 and a third wave in the summer and fall of 2010. A fourth 8-week production run began in March 2011, before it became a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line-up.\n\nA can of Mountain Dew contains 54 mg of caffeine (equivalent to ).\n\nAn urban legend about Mountain Dew ingredients is that dye Yellow #5 (tartrazine) lowers sperm count. Tartrazine has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends, nor has any other component of the drink. While some studies have shown that among children (with and without ADHD) tartrazine can increase ADHD-like symptoms (see Stevens, Kuczek, Burgess, Hurt & Arnold, 2010), the general consensus is that it does not. It can cause allergic-type sensitivity reactions (e.g. hives and asthma) in a small number of individuals, especially those who also have a sensitivity to aspirin.\n\nAmp Energy is an energy drink distributed by PepsiCo under the Mountain Dew brand. Launched in 2001, Amp was originally known as \"Mountain Dew AMP.\" From 2007 to 2008, several additional flavors of Amp were introduced. In 2012, AMP's labeling and ingredients changed, as did the flavor and appeal, according to fans. The Mountain Dew branding was also removed from cans during this change.\n\nLeading up to 2004, Pepsico conducted extensive research to develop a beverage with a taste and color to complement Taco Bell food products. The resulting product was named Mountain Dew \"Baja Blast\", a light blue-green colored, tropical-lime-flavored variety of the popular soft drink. Taco Bell was given a ten-year exclusive rights period during which Baja Blast would not be available in any store or other food outlet, not even to Taco Bell's fellow Yum brand restaurants.\n\nIn spring 2014, Mountain Dew began distributing its Baja Blast flavor in standard 12 ounce cans, 20 ounce bottles and 24 ounce cans for sale at supermarkets and retail businesses in the US. The new retail product bore the Taco Bell logo. Taco Bell's chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, said the exclusive drinks have helped increase the company's beverage sales, even as soda sales have declined in the broader market. He noted that people are more likely to buy drinks when they're available exclusively at the chain. Due to the drink's success, many other new beverages were introduced at Taco Bell including a new Taco Bell exclusive, Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, a non-alcoholic sangrita flavored Mountain Dew.\n\nBeginning in 2007, Mountain Dew began a promotion entitled \"DEWmocracy\", which involved the public electing new flavors, colors, names, packaging graphics and advertisements for upcoming Mountain Dew products. The campaign has been the subject of recognition within the advertising industry, cited as one of the earliest and longest-running examples of a consumer product brand employing crowdsourcing to make decisions which are traditionally made internally by employees. In its initial phase, Dewmocracy participation and voting was conducted via an online game. Television advertisements at the time featured actor Forest Whitaker asking people to decide the next new flavor of Mountain Dew. Online voters selected from three choices: Supernova (a strawberry-melon flavor), Revolution (a berry flavor), and Voltage (a raspberry-citrus flavor). Each included ginseng. The event ended on August 17, 2008, with Voltage announced as the winning flavor. It was officially released on December 29, 2008. According to Beverage Digest, sales of Dewmocracy flavors totaled 25 million cases in 2008.\n\nMountain Dew announced a continuation of the Dewmocracy campaign –referred to as \"Dewmocracy 2\" – which launched in July 2009. A marked difference between Dewmocracy 2 and its predecessor was the wider range of online voting methods, expanding beyond the Dewmocracy website to include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the \"Dew Labs Community\" – a private, online forum for the \"most passionate Dew fans.\" In July 2009, Dew Labs sampling trucks distributed product samples of seven potential flavor variations. At the same time, 50 \"Dew fanatics\" were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv, and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors. From the initial seven flavors, taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at retail stores. The three new candidate flavors were Distortion (a key lime flavor), Typhoon (a tropical punch flavor), and White Out (a smooth-citrus flavor). The three new candidate flavors were released on 19 April 2010 and voting lasted until 14 June. The following day, White Out was announced as the winner. Mountain Dew White Out was released for sale on 4 October 2010. A limited production White Out Slurpee (Mtn Dew White Out Freeze) was made available at 7-Eleven beginning in January 2011. In July 2011, Mountain Dew Typhoon was re-released briefly in 2-liter form.\n\nIn 2007, after using the term \"Game Fuel\" to market their sodas to the video-gaming subculture, Mountain Dew introduced a new flavor variant (citrus cherry) with the Game Fuel name. Coinciding with the release of the Xbox 360 game \"Halo 3\", Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image-based, showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series' main character Master Chief prominently. This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks, and was discontinued afterwards.\n\nTwo years later, the website for the popular MMORPG \"World of Warcraft\" stated that two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be sold in June 2009 and would promote the game. Shortly afterwards, the bottle art was released, and showed that the two flavors would promote different player races in the game. One of the two was exactly the same citrus cherry flavor from the original Halo 3 promotion, with updated packaging. The second flavor was a new wild fruit drink similar to the previously released Pepsi Blue. Both drinks were given World of Warcraft-based packaging, and sported the newly updated \"MTN Dew\" logo. Like their precursor, these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, Mountain Dew announced another return of the Game Fuel promotion on their Facebook page. The original citrus-cherry would once again return, along with a new tropical companion flavor. The announcement gave a planned release date of October 2011 and stated that the packaging would feature codes granting players double experience points in . Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011, a month before the planned release date. Later that same month, it was announced through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid-October, though it would vary by market. These flavors began appearing from the first week of October, and were also discontinued after 12 weeks of being on shelves.\n\nGame Fuel returned in October 2012 to promote \"Halo 4\", in the original citrus-cherry flavor. In August 2013, Mountain Dew announced that Game Fuel would be returning to stores in the fall of 2013, with a new blueberry version titled \"Electrifying Berry\". In October 2013, boxes of original citrus-cherry Game Fuel appeared on store shelves with packaging promoting Xbox One and the games Dead Rising 3 and Forza Motorsport 5 and with cans featuring Dead Rising 3 graphics. The new Electrifying Berry flavor of Game Fuel simultaneously appeared with packaging promoting Kinect Sports Rivals and the game Ryse: Son of Rome, graphics from which appear on the cans as well.\nIn May 2014, the original citrus-cherry Game Fuel began reappearing on shelves, but this time, the soda does not seem to be promoting any video game.\n\nIn October 2014, Game Fuel returned with a new lemonade flavor for the promotion of \"\". Unlike past two-variant Game Fuel releases, both drinks sport the same artwork (unlike 2009's Horde Red and Alliance Blue or 2011's citrus cherry and tropical), albeit differing colors to match their respective flavors. After the promotion ended, Citrus Cherry reverted to promotionless packaging while lemonade flavor was permanently removed from shelves.\n\nIn October 2015, Game Fuel returned a new companion flavor, Berry Lime, for the promotion of \"\". After the promotion, Citrus Cherry once again reverted to promotionless packaging, while the Berry Lime flavor remained available as a slurpee.\n\nImages leaked in May 2016 led to speculation that Game Fuel would once again see a new release later in 2016, with a new mango-flavored variant alongside the original citrus-cherry, promoting the game \"Titanfall 2\". Mountain Dew announced the return of Game Fuel and the new flavor, \"Mango Heat\", in September. Then, in October, Game Fuel was released with the \"Titanfall 2\" promotion, with a lower calorie version of the original citrus-cherry variant returning alongside the new \"Mango Heat\".\n\nIn 2017, Game Fuel returned with two previously discontinued flavors: Arctic Burst (originally released as a slurpee flavor in 2006 to promote \"Superman Returns\") and Tropical Smash (originally Flavor #736, one of the four prototype flavors for \"DEWmocracy II\" that lost to Mountain Dew White Out and did not make the final round). As was the case with the 2013 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Arctic Burst promoted \"\" while Tropical Smash promoted \"Forza 7\"). For the first time, Citrus Cherry was not fully part of the promotion, instead promotionless Citrus Cherry was sold with the same white caps with codes under them as the other flavors in the promotion.\n\nGreen Label is an online magazine, a partnership between Mountain Dew and Complex Media producing sponsored content covering action sports, music, art and style, housed at Green-Label.com. The site replaces several websites and a YouTube channel that have been overseen by PepsiCo since 2007. The initiative originated in 2013 and will continue through the year.\n\nMountain Dew's Green Label promotion originated in 2007, when a line of limited edition aluminum bottles was put into production, featuring artwork from a range of tattoo artists and other artists. This initial series marked the first use of the term \"Green Label Art\" to describe the use of artistic works on Mountain Dew packaging. In June 2010, a contest entitled \"Green Label Art: Shop Series\" was announced, involving 35 independent skateboard store owners who partnered with local artists to design and submit future can artwork designs. Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of the contest in October of the same year, with Street Science Skate Shop – a store in Tracy, California – named the winner of a cash prize. This winning can design was scheduled to appear on Mountain Dew cans at some point in 2011.\n\nIn 2008, a Mountain Dew-sponsored music label was launched under the name \"Green Label Sound\". In December 2010, a Mountain Dew Code Red television advertisement was produced, incorporating the hip-hop artist Jay Electronica performing his song \"The Announcement\". The advertisement concludes with the tagline \"Hip Hop is different on the mountain\".\n\nThe label released its first full-length album release, \"When Fish Ride Bicycles\" by the hip hop group The Cool Kids, on June 12, 2011.\n\nSponsorship of action sports athletes has been a part of Mountain Dew marketing since the late 1990s, with present sponsorship including Eli Reed (skateboarder), Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder), and Danny Davis (snowboarder). Mountain Dew also sponsors its own namesake festival, \"The Dew Tour\", which is an action sports tour made up of events held in five U.S. cities over several months. The first Dew Tour was held in the summer of 2005 with events in skateboarding, BMX and Freestyle Motocross. In 2008 it expanded to add a \"Winter Dew Tour\", comprising snowboarding and snow skiing competitions. It is \"\"the most watched and attended action sports event in the world,\"\" according to Transworld Snowboarding magazine. In coordination with its Dew Tour sponsorship, a sponsored television show entitled \"Mountain Dew's Green Label Experience\" premiered on Fuel TV in July 2010, for the primary purpose of broadcasting interviews with action sports athletes from each of the stops on the Dew Tour.\n\nUnder the term \"Green Label Gaming\" – coined in 2007 – Mountain Dew has broadened its sponsorship of independent video game designers and players. The brand is often the subject of media attention for its popularity among video game enthusiasts, as several flavors of Mountain Dew have been produced in partnership with video games. In December 2008, Mountain Dew produced a 30-minute television special which documented independent gamers in Japan and the U.S., which aired on the Spike TV network. In 2009, Mountain Dew sponsored two prominent gaming events: the Independent Games Festival and the Game Developers Conference. \"Green Label Gaming\" has since come under controversy over a sponsored Game Jam-themed reality show by Matti Leshem.\n\nIn 2008, Doritos debuted a mystery flavor known as \"Quest\", featuring a campaign of online puzzles and prizes to identify the Quest flavor. The flavor was later identified as Mountain Dew.\n\nIn October 2010, Mountain Dew started the \"FanDEWmonium\" promotion, a competition in which new flavors would compete to become permanent similar to the two DEWmocracy campaigns, but with eight diet flavors instead of three regular ones. Five of the participating flavors were diet versions of previous DEWmocracy flavors: Diet Super Nova, Diet Voltage, Diet Crave (originally Flavor #722), Diet Distortion, Diet Typhoon, and Diet White Out. Another flavor, Diet Ultra Violet, was returning from its own limited release in 2009. The remaining competitor was a brand-new Diet flavor created specifically for the promotion - Flare (berry-citrus-flavored). Each of the eight flavors was available for tasting at specific tour locations, and special cans were also mailed to some Dew Labs members.\n\nAlso similar to the DEWmocracy campaign, those who taste-tested the Diet flavors were asked to go online and vote for which flavors they thought should be permanently sold in stores. After the first round of voting was completed, two flavor finalists were chosen to receive a limited release to store shelves for a final round of voting. Diet Voltage and Diet Super Nova were sold in stores for an eight-week period beginning in March 2011. After votes were cast, it was announced that Diet Super Nova had won, with 55% of all votes, and it returned in January 2012. Afterwards, it was removed from shelves permanently after a 12-week release due to poor sales.\n\nOn 7 January 2011, Mountain Dew posted on their Facebook that Pitch Black would return to the shelves on May 2011, also stating that this may be the start of many re-releases of old favorites. The company promoted Pitch Black's return heavily with giveaways and contests. About a month before the planned release date, a photo was posted on a Mountain Dew worker's Pongr, which showed Pitch Black and 2008's Supernova. Two weeks before the release, Dew Labs announced the return of 2010's Typhoon in 2-Liter bottles exclusively at Walmart Supercenters. The three flavors were re-released to stores on May 2.\n\nAt the same time of the DEWmand Promotion, Mountain Dew launched the Throwback Shack, a website where participators could enter to win exclusive Dew merchandise, including a \"secret stash\" of Mountain Dew Revolution, a losing competitor from 2008's DEWmocracy. The promotional advertisements were then taken down from the Mountain Dew website. Mountain Dew later stated via tweet that there would not be any more flavors returning 'by Popular DEWmand' for now, as it was only intended to be a summer program.\n\nAfter much speculation over a leaked Instagram photo of a potential new flavor, it was officially announced that Mountain Dew was teaming up with Warner Bros. Pictures' and Legendary Pictures' film The Dark Knight Rises and released a limited-edition flavor on 18 June 2012. A website — DEWGothamCity.com — was launched, on which fans were able to enter codes to access exclusive content and details on the movie before its 20 July release date. Some Mountain Dew products temporarily featured packaging to promote the movie, including thermochromic 16 oz. cans that change color when cooled. The limited-edition flavor, Dark Berry, was mixed berry-flavored, and was available for 8 weeks.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises promotion inspired a permanent 24 oz. version of Mountain Dew.\n\nIn August 2012, Villa Enterprises held a promotion known as \"Dub the Dew\", where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of Mountain Dew. The promotion was infamously hijacked by users, particularly those originating from the imageboard 4chan, who submitted and upvoted entries such as \"Diabeetus\", \"Fapple\", \"Bill Cosby Sweat\", \"Jimmie Rustle's Jumpin' Juice\", and numerous variations of \"Gushing Granny\". Although the promotion was not directly connected to Mountain Dew, a representative from the company did offer to \"help clean up\" the site. \"Adweek\" compared the incident to another recent campaign hijacked under similar circumstances, where musician Pitbull was sent to perform in Kodiak, Alaska in a Walmart promotion.\n\nOn February 7, 2016 for Super Bowl 50, Mountain Dew aired a spot featuring a CGI character dubbed \"The puppy monkey baby\" (also styled PuppyMonkeyBaby). The promotion has garnered a wide amount of media coverage, both positive and negative. According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the Super Bowl commercials of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing.\n\nThe ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless; a Pug puppy (the head), a monkey (the body and tail), and a dancing baby (the hips and legs). The puppy monkey baby dances with three men who are presumably watching the Super Bowl, offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine).\n\nThe media response to the advertisement has been mixed to negative. Melissa Cronin of Gawker described it as a \"horror-hallucination of brand awareness\", while noting the beverage itself contains brominated vegetable oil, a chemical that is banned in several countries. Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn & Wolfe, called it \"weird\".\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Mountain Dew announced the return of two popular favorites, Baja Blast and Pitch Black. Fans can vote on which flavor stays permanently on store shelves via the Mountain Dew website. Voting ended on July 9, and, after many delays, Pitch Black was announced the winner on July 18, 2016. Pitch Black continues to be produced and became part of the brand's lineup starting in September.\n\nFollowing the success of Code Red in 2001, over 40 Mountain Dew flavors have been introduced. This table covers all Mountain Dew flavor variants to date.\n\nThe tune \"Good Old Mountain Dew\" has been recorded and covered by artists like The Stanley Brothers, Grandpa Jones and Willie Nelson. In its original bluegrass context, \"Mountain Dew\" refers to moonshine.\n\nAfter PepsiCo bought the soft drink Mountain Dew in 1964, they commissioned a set of advertisements featuring a \"Good Old Mountain Dew\"-based jingle and the drink's hillbilly mascot. The last song of the 2003 album \"It's Pronounced Five Two\" by Christian rapper KJ-52 titled \"Gimme Dat\" is a narrative about the singer attending MDA (Mountain Dew Anonymous) and telling about how he is addicted to the soft drink.\n\nIn the musical Be More Chill, green Mountain Dew activates the Squip, a tiny super computer in a pill that tells the user what to do, in order to help them achieve their goals. Mountain Dew Red shuts them off. In the musical it is said that this is the reason for Mountain Dew Red being discontinued.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52100", "title": "Charades", "text": "Charades\n\nCharades (, ) is a parlor or party word guessing game. Originally, the game was a dramatic form of literary charades: a single person would act out each syllable of a word or phrase in order, followed by the whole phrase together, while the rest of the group guessed. A variant was to have teams who acted scenes out together while the others guessed. Today, it is common to require the actors to mime their hints without using any spoken words, which requires some conventional gestures. Puns and visual puns were and remain common.\n\nA charade was a form of literary riddle popularized in France in the 18th century where each syllable of the answer was described enigmatically as a separate word before the word as a whole was similarly described. The term \"charade\" was borrowed into English from French in the second half of the eighteenth century, denoting a \"kind of riddle in which each syllable of a word, or a complete word or phrase, is enigmatically described or dramatically represented\". \n\nWritten forms of charade appeared in magazines, books, and on the folding fans of the Regency. The answers were sometimes printed on the reverse of the fan, suggesting that they were a flirting device, used by a young woman to tease her beau. One charade composed by Jane Austen goes as follows:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nWhen my first is a task to a young girl of spirit,\nAnd my second confines her to finish the piece,\nHow hard is her fate! but how great is her merit\nIf by taking my whole she effects her release!\n</poem>\nThe answer is \"hem-lock\".\n\nWilliam Mackworth Praed's poetic charades became famous. \n\nLater examples omitted direct references to individual syllables, such as the following, said to be a favorite of Theodore Roosevelt:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\nI talk, but I do not speak my mind\nI hear words, but I do not listen to thoughts\nWhen I wake, all see me\nWhen I sleep, all hear me\nMany heads are on my shoulders\nMany hands are at my feet\nThe strongest steel cannot break my visage\nBut the softest whisper can destroy me\nThe quietest whimper can be heard.\n</poem>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the 11th edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" offered these two prose charades as \"perhaps as good as could be selected\":\n\nand\n\nwith the answers being tartar and conundrum.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the French began performing \"acting\" or \"acted charades\"—with the written description replaced by dramatic performances as a parlor game—and this was brought over to Britain by the English aristocracy. Thus the term gradually became more popularly used to refer to acted charades, examples of which are described in William Thackeray's \"Vanity Fair\" and in Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\".\n\nThackeray snarked that charades were enjoyed for \"enabling the many ladies amongst us who had beauty to display their charms, and the fewer number who had cleverness, to exhibit their wit\". In his \"Vanity Fair\", the height of Rebecca Sharp's social success is brought on by her performances of acting charades before the Prince Regent. The first scene—\"first two syllables\"—displays a Turkish lord dealing with a slaver and his odalisque before being garroted by the sultan's chief black eunuch; the second—\"last two syllables\"—finds a Turk, his consort, and his black slave praying at sunrise when an enormous Egyptian head enters and begins singing. The answer—Agamemnon—is then acted out by Becky's husband, while she makes her (first) appearance as Clytemnestra. After refreshments, another round begins, partially in pantomime: the first scene shows a household yawningly finishing a game of cribbage and preparing for bed; the second opens on the household bustling with activity as daybreak prompts bells ringing, arguments over receipts, collection of the chamber pots, calls for carriages, and greetings to new guests; the third closes with a ship's crew and passengers tossed about by a storm with strong winds. The answer—nightingale—is then (somewhat mistakenly) acted out by Becky in the role of a singing French marquise, recalling both Lacoste's 1705 tragic opera \"Philomèle\" and an \"arriviste\" lover and wife of Louis XIV. Apart from its importance in the book, the scenes were subsequently considered models of the genre.\n\nBy the time of the First World War, \"acting charades\" had become the most popular form and, as written charades were forgotten, it adopted its present, terser name. Thackeray's scenes—even those said to be \"in pantomime\"—included dialogue from the actors but truly \"dumb\" or \"mime charades\" gradually became more popular as well and similarly dropped their descriptive adjectives. The amateurish acting involved in charades led to the word's use to describe any obvious or inept deception, but over time \"a charade\" became used more broadly for any put-on (even highly competent and successful ones) and its original association with the parlor game has largely been lost.\n\nThe acted form of charades has been repeatedly made into television game shows, including the American \"Play the Game\", \"Movietown, RSVP\", \"Pantomime Quiz\", \"Stump the Stars\", \"Celebrity Charades\", \"Showoffs\" and \"Body Language\"; the British \"Give Us a Clue\"; the Canadian \"Party Game\" and \"Acting Crazy\"; and the Australian \"Celebrity Game\". On Britain's BBC Radio 4, \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\" performs a variant of the old written and spoken form of the game as \"Sound Charades\".\n\nAs a long-lived and informal game, charades' rules can vary widely. Common features of the game include holding up a number of fingers to indicate the number of syllables in the answer, silently replying to questions, and making a \"come on\" gesture once the guesses become close; some forms of the games, however, forbid anything except physically acting out the answer. In a mixed setting, it is therefore advisable to clarify the rules before play begins.\n\nCommon features of the modern game include:\n\n\nAn alternative set of rules can be found at http://barelybad.com/charades.htm.\n\nIn India Dumb Charades is popularly known (mis-pronounced) as DUM SHERAS (दम शेराज)\n\nNote that some of these signs may be banned from some forms of the game.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52824", "title": "Orange juice", "text": "Orange juice\n\nOrange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as \"pulp\" in American English, and \"(juicy) bits\" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as \"OJ\".\n\nCommercial orange juice with a long shelf life is made by pasteurizing the juice and removing the oxygen from it. This removes much of the taste, necessitating the later addition of a flavor pack, generally made from orange products. Additionally, some juice is further processed by drying and later rehydrating the juice, or by concentrating the juice and later adding water to the concentrate.\n\nThe health value of orange juice is debatable: it has a high concentration of vitamin C, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.\n\nDuring World War II, American soldiers rejected vitamin C-packed lemon crystals because of their unappetizing taste. Thus the government searched for a food that would fulfill the nutritional needs of the soldiers, have a desirable taste, and prevent diseases such as scurvy in a transportable vitamin C product. The federal government, the Florida department of Citrus, along with a group of scientists desired to develop a superior product to canned orange juice (which was the current orange juice on the market in the 1940s) and developed frozen concentrated orange juice. Unfortunately frozen concentrated orange juice was developed three years after the war had ended.\n\nBy 1949, orange juice processing plants in Florida were producing over 10 million gallons of concentrated orange juice. Consumers were captivated with the idea of concentrated canned orange juice as it was affordable, tasty, convenient, and a vitamin-C packed product. The preparation was simple, thaw the juice, add water, and stir. However, by the 1980s, food scientists developed a more fresh-tasting juice known as reconstituted ready to serve juice. Eventually in the 1990s, \"not from concentrate\" (NFC) orange juice was developed and gave consumers an entirely new perspective of orange juice transforming the product from can to freshness in a carton. Orange juice is a common breakfast beverage in the United States.\n\nDue to the importance of oranges to the economy of Florida, \"the juice obtained from mature oranges of the species Citrus sinensis and hybrids thereof\" was adopted as the official beverage of Florida in 1967.\n\nA cup serving of raw, fresh orange juice, amounting to 248 grams or 8 ounces, has 124 mg of vitamin C (>100% RDI). It has 20.8 g of sugars, 112 Calories and almost 26 grams of carbohydrates. It also supplies potassium, thiamin, and folate.\n\nCitrus juices contain flavonoids (especially in the pulp) that may have health benefits. Orange juice is also a source of the antioxidant hesperidin. Because of its citric acid content, orange juice is acidic, with a typical pH of around 3.5.\n\nCommercial squeezed orange juice is pasteurized and filtered before being evaporated under vacuum and heat. After removal of most of the water, this concentrate, about 65% sugar by weight, is then stored at about . Essences, Vitamin C, and oils extracted during the vacuum concentration process may be added back to restore flavor and nutrition (see below).\n\nWhen water is added to freshly thawed concentrated orange juice, it is said to be \"reconstituted\".\n\nThe product was developed in 1948 at the University of Florida's Citrus Research and Education Center. Since, it has emerged as a soft commodity, and futures contracts have traded in New York since 1966. Options on FCOJ were introduced in 1985. From the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, the product had the greatest orange juice market share, but not-from-concentrate juices surpassed FCOJ in the 1980s.\n\nOrange juice that is pasteurized and then sold to consumers without having been concentrated is labeled as \"not from concentrate\". Just as \"from concentrate\" processing, most \"not from concentrate\" processing reduces the natural flavor from the juice. The largest producers of \"not from concentrate\" use a production process where the juice is placed in aseptic storage, with the oxygen stripped from it, for up to a year.\n\nRemoving the oxygen also strips out flavor-providing compounds, and so manufacturers add a flavor pack in the final step, which \"Cooks Illustrated\" magazine describes as containing \"highly engineered additives.\" Flavor pack formulas vary by region, because consumers in different parts of the world have different preferences related to sweetness, freshness and acidity. According to the citrus industry, the Food and Drug Administration does not require the contents of flavor packs to be detailed on a product's packaging.\n\nOne common component of flavor packs is ethyl butyrate, a natural aroma that people associate with freshness, and which is removed from juice during pasteurization and storage. \"Cooks Illustrated\" sent juice samples to independent laboratories, and found that while fresh-squeezed juice naturally contained about 1.19 milligrams of ethyl butyrate per liter, juice that had been commercially processed had levels as high as 8.53 milligrams per liter.\n\nA small fraction of fresh orange juice is canned. Canned orange juice retains vitamin C much better than bottled juice. The canned product loses flavor, however, when stored at room temperature for more than 12 weeks. In the early years of canned orange juice, the acidity of the juice caused the juice to have a metallic taste. In 1931, Dr. Philip Phillips developed a flash pasteurization process that eliminated this problem and significantly increased the market for canned orange juice.\n\nFresh-squeezed, the unpasteurized juice is the closest to consuming the orange itself. This version of the juice consists of oranges that are squeezed and then bottled without having any additives or flavor packs inserted. The juice is not subjected to pasteurization. Depending on storage temperature, freshly squeezed, unpasteurized orange juice can have a shelf life of 5 to 23 days.\n\nIn the U.S., the major orange juice brand is Tropicana Products (owned by PepsiCo Inc.), which possesses nearly 65% of the market share. Tropicana also has a large presence in Latin America, Europe, and Central Asia. Competing products include Minute Maid (of The Coca-Cola Company) and Florida's Natural (a Floridian agricultural cooperative that differentiates itself from the competition by being locally owned and using only Florida grown oranges; Tropicana and Simply Orange use a mixture of domestic and foreign stock).\n\nIn Australia, Daily Juice (owned by National Foods) is a major brand of partially fresh, partially preserved, orange juice.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, major orange juice brands include Del Monte and Princes.\n\nSome producers add citric acid or ascorbic acid to juice beyond what is naturally found in the orange. Some also include other nutrients. Often, additional vitamin C is added to replace that destroyed in pasteurization. Additional calcium may be added. Vitamin D, not found naturally in oranges, may be added as well. Sometimes omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils are added to orange juice. Low-acid varieties of orange juice also are available.\n\nFCOJ producers generally use evaporators to remove much of the water from the juice in order to decrease its weight and decrease transportation costs. Other juice producers generally deaerate the juice so that it can be sold much later in the year.\n\nBecause such processes remove the distinct aroma compounds that give orange juice a fresh-squeezed taste, producers later add back these compounds in a proprietary mixture, called a \"flavor pack\", in order to improve the taste and to ensure a consistent year-round taste. The compounds in the flavor packs are derived from orange peels. Producers do not mention the addition of flavor packs on the label of the orange juice.\n\nCommon orange juice is made from the sweet orange. Different cultivars (for example, Valencia, Hamlin) have different properties, and a producer may mix cultivar juices to get the desired taste. Orange juice usually varies between shades of orange and yellow, although some ruby red or blood orange varieties are a reddish-orange or even pinkish. This is due to different pigmentation in ruby red oranges.\n\nThe blood orange is a mutant of the sweet orange. The Mandarin orange and varieties clementine and tangerine, are often used for sparkling juice drinks.\n\nRecently, many brands of organic orange juices have become available on the market.\n\nThe processing of orange to frozen concentrated orange juice begins with testing the orange fruit for quality to ensure it is safe for the process. Then the fruit is cleaned and washed thoroughly and orange oil is taken from the peel of the orange. Next, the juice is extracted from the orange and is screened in order to remove seeds and large pieces of pulp. The juice is then heated to 190 to 200 °F in order to inactivate natural enzymes found in the juice. The concentration step occurs in a high vacuum evaporator where the water content in the juice is evaporated while the juice sugar compounds and solids are concentrated. The vacuum evaporator is a low temperature falling-film mechanism, which operates at a temperature between 60 and 80 °F. Evaporators work in a continuous manner in that fresh juice is added as concentrate is being constantly removed. The concentration process increases the soluble solid portion of the juice from 12 °Brix to 60-70 °Brix.\n\nThe concentrated juice is held in a cold wall tank and is stored at or below 35 °F to prevent browning and development of undesired flavors. Next, a small amount of fresh juice is added to the concentrated juice to restore natural and fresh flavors of orange juice that have been lost through the concentration process. Specific cold-pressed orange oils are used to restore the lost aroma and volatile flavors. After the addition of fresh juice, the brix content is reduced to 42 °F. The fresh juice is referred to as \"cut-back\" in the industry and attributes to 7-10% of the total juice. Orange peel oil is also added if the oil content is below the required level. The concentrate is then further cooled in a continuous cooler or cold wall tank to 20 to 25 °F. The concentrate is canned using steam injection methods to sterilize the lid and develop a vacuum in the can. The cans then undergo final freezing where they are conveyed on a perforated belt in an air blast at -40 °F. After freezing, the product is stored at 0 °F in a refrigerated warehouse.\n\nSingle strength orange juice (SSOJ) can either be \"not from concentrate\" (NFC) orange juice or juice that is reconstituted from a concentrate with the addition of water to reach a specific single strength brix level. The processing of SSOJ also begins with the selection of orange. The most common types of orange used to produce orange juice are the Pineapple orange, Valencia orange, and Washington Navel oranges from Florida and California. The manufacturing journey begins when oranges are delivered to processing plants by trucks holding about 35,000 to 40,000 pounds of fruit. The fruit is unloaded at the plant for inspection and grading to remove unsuitable fruit before the oranges enter the storage bins. An automatic sampler contraption removes oranges for determination of acid and soluble solids. The bins are organized based on ratio of soluble solids to acids in order to blend oranges appropriate to produce juice with uniform flavor. After the fruit leaves the bins, they are scrubbed with detergent on a rotary brush washer and subsequently rinsed with potable water. Throughout the processing stages, there are multiple points with facilities that inspect oranges and discard damaged fruit.\n\nThe oranges then go through roller conveyors, which expose all sides of the fruit. The roller conveyors are efficiently built as they are well lighted, installed at a convenient height, and width to ensure all inspectors can reach the fruit to determine inadequacies. Some reasons why fruit may be rejected include indication of mold, rot, and ruptured peels. Afterwards, the oranges are separated based on size through machines prior to juice extraction. There are a number of different ways orange juice industry leaders extract their oranges. Some common methods include halving the fruit and pressing/reaming the orange to extract juice from the orange. One instrument inserts a tube through the orange peel and forces the juice out through the tube by squeezing the entire orange. Despite the variety of machines used to extract juices, all machines have commonalities in that they are rugged, fast, easy to clean and have the ability to reduce peel extractives into the juice. The extracted juice product does not contain the orange peel, but it may contain pulp and seeds, which are removed by finishers.\n\nFinishers have a screw-type design that comprises a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations the size of 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, the finished orange juice flows through blending tanks where the juice is tested for acid and soluble solids. At this stage, sugar can be added to the juice depending on if the product will be a sweetened or unsweetened beverage. Following blending, the orange juice is deaerated where the air is incorporated into the juice during extraction. The benefits of deaeration include the elimination of foaming, which improves the uniformity of can fill and improvement regarding the efficiency of the heat exchanger. Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice. Condensation separates the oil and the aqueous distillate, which is returned to the juice.\n\nThe next step is one of the most vital in the processing of orange juice. Pasteurization is important in destroying naturally occurring enzymes that are associated with deterioration of the juice. Pectinesterase is infamous for its deteriorative activity in orange juice. In the pasteurization process, the juice is generally rapidly heated to 197 °F for about 40 seconds. Several industry leaders use flash pasteurization, which is carried out by tubular or plate-type heat exchangers. In order to prevent overheating, turbulent flow is vital to heat the juice rapidly. Cans are filled with the pasteurized juice and inverted immediately to allow the juice to sterilize the inside parts of the lid. The orange juice filled can is sealed and cooled to 90 to 100 °F by spinning on the conveyor belt under cool water sprays. Quality of storage is determined by time and temperature. Juice must be stored at cool temperatures to prevent deterioration.\n\nFor Canadian markets, orange juice must be the fruit juice obtained from clean, sound, and mature oranges. The juice must also contain a minimum of 1.20 milliequivalents of free amino acids per 100 millilitres, contain a minimum of 115 milligrams of potassium per 10 milliliters, and possess a minimum absorbance value for total polyphenolics of 0.380. Sweeteners such as sugar, invert sugar, dextrose or glucose solids may be added. The orange juice must have a Brix reading of at least 9.7, excluding the sweetening ingredients, and contain between 0.5 and 1.8 percent of acid by weight calculated as anhydrous citric acid. Added orange essences, orange oils and orange pulp adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice is permitted. Orange juice is also permitted to contain sugar, invert sugar, dextrose in dry form, glucose solids, a Class II preservative, amylase, cellulase and pectinase.\n\nIn the United States, orange juice is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. According to the FDA, orange juice from concentrate is a mixture of water with frozen concentrated orange juice or concentrated orange juice for manufacturing. Additional ingredients into the mixture may include fresh/frozen/pasteurized orange juice from mature oranges, orange oil, and orange pulp. Furthermore, one or more of the following optional sweetening ingredients may be added: sugar, sugar syrup, invert sugar, invert sugar syrup, dextrose, corn syrup, dried corn syrup, glucose syrup, and dried glucose syrup. The orange juice must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.8, which indicates the percentage of orange juice soluble solids, excluding any added sweetening ingredients.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, orange juice from concentrate is a product of concentrated fruit juice with the addition of water. Any lost flavour or pulp of the orange juice during the initial concentration process may be restored in the final product to be equivalent to an average type of orange juice of the same kind. Any restored flavour or pulp must come from the same species of orange. Sugar may be added to the orange juice for regulating the acidic taste or sweetening, but must not exceed 150g per litre of orange juice. Across the UK, the final orange juice from concentrate product must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.2, excluding the additional sweetening ingredients. Vitamins and minerals may be added to the orange juice in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1925/2006.\n\nOn a molecular level, orange juice is composed of organic acids, sugars, and phenolic compounds. The main organic acids found in orange juice are citric, malic, and ascorbic acid. The major sugars found in orange juice are sucrose, glucose, and fructose. There are approximately 13 phenolic compounds in orange juice including hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanones, hydroxybenzoic acids, hesperidin, narirutin, and ferulic acid.\n\nThe cloud is the portion of suspended particles that range in size from 0.05 micrometers to a few hundred micrometers in orange juice. The cloud is responsible for several sensory attributes in orange juice including color, aroma, texture, and taste. The continuous medium of the cloud consists of a solution of sugars, pectin, and organic acids while the dispersed matter is formed through cellular tissue comminuted in fruit processing. Specifically, the cloudiness of the juice is caused by pectin, protein, lipid, hemicellulose, cellulose, hesperidin, chromoplastids, amorphous particles, and oil globules. In particular the chemical composition of the cloud consists of 4.5-32% pectin, 34-52% protein, 25% lipids, 5.7% nitrogen, 2% hemicellulose, 2% ash, and less than 2% cellulose.\n\nOrange juice is a suspension that consists of heterogeneous particles in a clear serum. A serum is the clear supernatant after the precipitation of the cloud through centrifugation. The previously mentioned cloud makes up a large part of the suspension.\n\nIf the suspension in orange juice is not stable, the cloud particles can flocculate which causes the suspension to physically decompose. The cloud can break apart and the citrus juice will clarify if the suspension becomes unstable. The activity of pectin methyl esterase increased the interaction between pectin and cloud proteins, which led to protein-pectin flocculation. The insoluble material of the cloud clumps in conditions above 70 °C and at a pH of 3-4 at which proteins coagulate and flocculate. Cloud flocculation is enhanced at pH 3.5 and can result in clarification, which is undesirable in orange juice.\n\nThe suspension is unstable when the zeta potential is less than 25 mv in magnitude. Zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude of electrostatic forces between particles, which affect repulsion, and attraction between particles. A low zeta value signifies that the repulsive forces will not be able to overcome van der waals attractions between cloud particles and thus begin to agglomerate. Agglomeration of cloud particles will prevent free flow characteristics, which is essential in the juice. A high zeta potential will inhibit particle-particle agglomeration and maintain the free flowing nature as well as uniform dispersion in orange juice.\n\nThe oil globules adsorbed to the cloud particles stabilize the suspension by decreasing the average density of particles to bring it closer to that of the serum. However, large amounts of oil can be problematic as they cause complete breakdown of suspensions by causing cloud particles to float to the surface. The particles in the cloud have a negative charge that decreases with decreasing pH. In accordance with cloud stability, the hydration of particles is more significant than their electrical charge.\n\nHeat treatment\n\nWhen orange juice is heat treated there is an increase in the number of fine particles and decrease in that of coarse particles. The fine particles in particular are responsible for the appearance, color, and flavor of orange juice. Heat treatment plays a vital role on pulp volume, cloud stability, serum turbidity, and serum viscosity. Heat treatment stabilizes the cloud through enzyme inactivation and enhances the turbidity of a stable cloud formation. The increase in serum viscosity is due to the extraction of pectic substances into the serum. Based on Stoke's law, the increase in serum viscosity is the cause for the enhanced cloud stability. In relation to pulp volume, the pulp from heated juices was finer and more compact than unheated juice pulp, which was voluminous and fluffy.\n\nProperties of pulp\n\nIn orange juice, pulp is responsible for desirable flow properties, taste, flavor, and mouth feel. However, pulpy orange juice precipitates based on a rate dependent on the diameter, density, and viscosity of the suspended particles as well as the suspending juice. In order to remain suspended in orange juice, pulp particles must have appropriate particle size, charge, and specific gravity. Depending on type of processing method, the size of pulp particles ranges from 2-5 millimeters. Those that are smaller than 2mm are known to be more stable, so it is beneficial to reduce the size of particles by incorporating hydrocolloids to the juice product. Hydrocolloids would decrease the rate of sediment formation and decrease the falling rate of pulp particles.\n\nHydrocolloids\n\nHydrocolloids are long-chain polymers that form viscous dispersions and gels if dispersed in water. They have a number of functional properties in food products including emulsifying, thickening, coating, gelling, and stabilization. The main reason hydrocolloids are used in foods is their capability to modify the rheology of food systems. Hydrocolloids impact viscosity through flow behavior and mechanical solid properties like texture. Some common hydrocolloids that are used to stabilize juice products include Magellan, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan, guar gum, and gum Arabic. The aforementioned hydrocolloids are generally used in the production of imitation orange juices and are often referred to as synthetic hydrocolloids. Pectin is the hydrocolloid found in natural orange juices.\n\nProperties of pectin\n\nPectin is the soluble polymeric material in the pulp of oranges, which contains 75% of carboxyl of arabinose and galactose. Pectic compounds are complex heteropolysaccharides in that their chemical composition includes a chain structure of axial-axial α-1.4-linked d-galacturonic acid unit along with blocks of L-rhamnose regions that have side chains of arabinose, galactose, and xylose. Pectin methyl-esterase is the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing carboxymethyl esters and liberating free carboxyl groups and methyl alcohols. The free carboxyl groups interact with cations to form insoluble pectic acid divalent metal ion complexes. These metal ion complexes precipitate in the juice and carry all the colloids in orange juice with it. The enzyme would flocculate the cloud and clarify the orange juice. Thus, in order to keep the orange juice cloud intact, it is vital to inactivate pectinesterase. Pectinesterase is inactivated by heating the juice for 1 minute at 90 °C.\n\nInteractions of pectin\n\nThe solution behavior of pectin is strongly influenced by a number of factors including hydrogen bonding, ionic character, and hydrophobic character. Hydrogen bonding is favored when pH is less than pKa while the ionic character is favored when pH is greater than pKa. Ionic character relies on free carboxyl content, the presence of cations, and is favored at a high water activity. Charge-charge repulsions along with the presence of neutral side chains are essential in inhibiting intermolecular association among pectin molecules. The methyl ester content in orange juice determines hydrophobic character, which is favored at low water activity.\n\nThere is a specific interaction between pectin and hesperidin through the sugar moieties in the hesperidin molecule. Through acid hydrolysis, the rhamnose and glucose sugar moieties are removed from hesperidin, which breaks the interaction between hesperidin and pectin. Hydrogen bonding plays a role in the specific interaction of neutral sugars of pectin and the sugar moiety of hesperidin. A polymer that has a high structural content of neutral sugar branches interacts with hesperidin more tightly and strongly than that of a low content of neutral sugar branches. The interaction between pectin and hesperidin is one of the factors that enable the colloidal suspension in orange juice to be stable.\n\n\n\n"}

The wah-wah effect is a spectral glide, a \"modification of the vowel quality of a tone\" .\n\nThe word is derived from the sound of the effect itself; an imitative or onomatopoeia word. The effect's \"wa-wa\" sound was noted by jazz player Barney Bigard when he heard Tricky Sam Nanton use the effect on his trombone in the early 1920s .\n\nThe wah-wah effect is believed to have originated in the 1920s, with brass instrument players finding they could produce an expressive crying tone by moving a mute, or plunger, in and out of the instrument's bell . In 1921, trumpet player Johnny Dunn's use of this style inspired Tricky Sam Nanton to use the mute with the trombone .\n\nBy the early 1960s, the sound of the acoustic technique had been emulated with electronic circuitry (; ). For electric guitar the wah-wah pedal was invented.\n\nThe method of production varies from one type of instrument to another. On brass instruments, it is usually created by means of a mute, particularly with the harmon (also called a \"wa-wa\" mute) or plunger mute. Woodwind instruments may use \"false fingerings\" to produce the effect. \n\nAny electrified instrument may use an auxiliary signal-processing device, or pedal. Often it is controlled by movement of the player's foot on a rocking pedal connected to a potentiometer. An alternative to players directly controlling the amount of effect is an 'auto-wah'. These devices, usually make harder hit notes more trembly with a more prominent wah wah effect . Wah-wah effects are often used for soloing or for creating a \"wacka-wacka\" funk rhythm on guitar . Although these electronic means are most often on electric guitar, they are also often used on electric piano .\n\nThe wah-wah effect is produced by periodically bringing in and out of play treble frequencies while a note is sustained. Therefore, the effect is a type of spectral glide, a \"modification of the vowel quality of a tone\" . \n\nThe Electronic wah-wah effects are produced by controlling tone filters with a pedal . An envelope follower circuit is used in the 'auto-wah'.. Subtractive synthesis can produce a similar effect.\n\nTricky Sam Nanton's wah-wah on trombone in Duke Ellington's Orchestra became well known as part of the so-called \"jungle effects\" of the band in the late 1920s . This technique has been used in contemporary music. Karlheinz Stockhausen notates the use of the wah-wah mute in his \"Punkte\" (1952/1962) in terms of transitions between open to close using open and closed circles connected by a line . Although the most common method of producing wah-wah on brass instruments is with a mute, some players have used electronic filtering, notably Miles Davis on trumpet .\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52974", "title": "Emergency medicine", "text": "Emergency medicine\n\nEmergency medicine, also known as accident and emergency medicine, is the medical specialty concerned with the care of illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention. Emergency physicians care for unscheduled and undifferentiated patients of all ages. As first-line providers, their primary responsibility is to initiate resuscitation and stabilization and to start investigations and interventions to diagnose and treat illnesses in the acute phase. Emergency physicians generally practice in hospital emergency departments, pre-hospital settings via emergency medical services, and intensive care units, but may also work in primary care settings such as urgent care clinics. Sub-specializations of emergency medicine include disaster medicine, medical toxicology, ultrasonography, critical care medicine, hyperbaric medicine, sports medicine, palliative care, or aerospace medicine.\n\nDifferent models for emergency medicine exist internationally. In countries following the Anglo-American model, emergency medicine was originally the domain of surgeons, general practitioners, and other generalist physicians, but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality in its own right with its own training programmes and academic posts, and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners. By contrast, in countries following the Franco-German model, the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists (for critical resuscitation), surgeons, specialists in internal medicine, pediatricians, cardiologists or neurologists as appropriate. In developing countries, emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited.\n\nEmergency Medicine is a medical specialty—a field of practice based on the knowledge and skills required for the prevention, diagnosis and management of acute and urgent aspects of illness and injury affecting patients of all age groups with a full spectrum of undifferentiated physical and behavioral disorders. It further encompasses an understanding of the development of pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medical systems and the skills necessary for this development.\n\nThe field of emergency medicine encompasses care involving the acute care of internal medical and surgical conditions. In many modern emergency departments, emergency physicians are tasked with seeing a large number of patients, treating their illnesses and arranging for disposition—either admitting them to the hospital or releasing them after treatment as necessary. They also provide episodic primary care to patients during off hours and for those who do not have primary care providers. Most patients present to emergency departments with low-acuity conditions (such as minor injuries or exacerbations of chronic disease), but a small proportion will be critically ill or injured. Therefore, the emergency physician requires a broad field of knowledge and procedural skills often including surgical procedures, trauma resuscitation, advanced cardiac life support and advanced airway management. They must have some of the core skills from many medical specialities—the ability to resuscitate a patient (intensive care medicine), manage a difficult airway (anesthesiology), suture a complex laceration (plastic surgery), set a fractured bone or dislocated joint (orthopedic surgery), treat a heart attack (cardiology), manage strokes (neurology), work-up a pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding (obstetrics and gynecology), control a patient with mania (psychiatry), stop a severe nosebleed (otolaryngology), place a chest tube (cardiothoracic surgery), and conduct and interpret x-rays and ultrasounds (radiology). This generalist approach can obviate barrier-to-care issues seen in systems without specialists in emergency medicine, where patients requiring immediate attention are instead managed from the outset by speciality doctors such as surgeons or internal physicians. However, this may lead to barriers through acute and critical care specialties disconnecting from emergency care. \n\nEmergency medicine can be distinguished from urgent care, which refers to immediate healthcare for less emergent medical issues, but there is obvious overlap and many emergency physicians work in urgent care settings. Emergency medicine also includes many aspects of acute primary care, and shares with family medicine the uniqueness of seeing all patients regardless of age, gender or organ system . The emergency physician workforce also includes many competent physicians who trained in other specialties.\n\nPhysicians specializing in emergency medicine can enter fellowships to receive credentials in subspecialties such as palliative care, critical-care medicine, medical toxicology, wilderness medicine, pediatric emergency medicine, sports medicine, disaster medicine, tactical medicine, ultrasound, pain medicine, pre-hospital emergency medicine, or undersea and hyperbaric medicine.\n\nThe practice of emergency medicine is often quite different in rural areas where there are far fewer other specialties and healthcare resources. In these areas, family physicians with additional skills in emergency medicine often staff emergency departments. Rural emergency physicians may be the only health care providers in the community, and require skills that include primary care and obstetrics.\n\nPatterns vary by country and region. In the United States, the employment arrangement of emergency physician practices are either private (with a co-operative group of doctors staffing an emergency department under contract), institutional (physicians with an independent contractor relationship with the hospital), corporate (physicians with an independent contractor relationship with a third-party staffing company that services multiple emergency departments), or governmental (for example, when working within personal service military services, public health services, veterans' benefit systems or other government agencies).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all consultants in emergency medicine work in the National Health Service and there is little scope for private emergency practice. In other countries like Australia, New Zealand or Turkey, emergency medicine specialists are almost always salaried employees of government health departments and work in public hospitals, with pockets of employment in private or non-government aeromedical rescue or transport services, as well as some private hospitals with emergency departments; they may be supplemented or backed by non-specialist medical officers, and visiting general practitioners. Rural emergency departments may be headed by general practitioners alone, sometimes with non-specialist qualifications in emergency medicine.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, after seeing the speed with which the carriages of the French flying artillery maneuvered across the battlefields, French military surgeon Dominique Jean Larrey applied the idea of ambulances, or \"flying carriages\", for rapid transport of wounded soldiers to a central place where medical care was more accessible and effective. Larrey manned ambulances with trained crews of drivers, corpsmen and litter-bearers and had them bring the wounded to centralized field hospitals, effectively creating a forerunner of the modern MASH units. Dominique Jean Larrey is sometimes called the father of emergency medicine for his strategies during the French wars.\n\nEmergency medicine as an independent medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960s and 1970s, hospital emergency departments (EDs) were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them family physicians, general surgeons, internists, and a variety of other specialists. In many smaller emergency departments, nurses would triage patients and physicians would be called in based on the type of injury or illness. Family physicians were often on call for the emergency department, and recognized the need for dedicated emergency department coverage. Many of the pioneers of emergency medicine were family physicians and other specialists who saw a need for additional training in emergency care.\n\nDuring this period, groups of physicians began to emerge who had left their respective practices in order to devote their work completely to the ED. In the UK in 1952, Maurice Ellis was appointed as the first \"casualty consultant\" at Leeds General Infirmary. In 1967, the Casualty Surgeons Association was established with Maurice Ellis as its first President. In the US, the first of such groups was headed by Dr. James DeWitt Mills in 1961 who, along with four associate physicians; Dr. Chalmers A. Loughridge, Dr. William Weaver, Dr. John McDade, and Dr. Steven Bednar at Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia, established 24/7 year-round emergency care, which became known as the \"Alexandria Plan\". \n\nIt was not until the establishment of American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the recognition of emergency medicine training programs by the AMA and the AOA, and in 1979 a historical vote by the American Board of Medical Specialties that emergency medicine became a recognized medical specialty in the US. The first emergency medicine residency program in the world was begun in 1970 at the University of Cincinnati and the first Department of Emergency Medicine at a US medical school was founded in 1971 at the University of Southern California. The second residency program in the United States soon followed at what was then called Hennepin County General Hospital in Minneapolis, with two residents entering the program in 1971.\n\nIn 1990 the UK's Casualty Surgeons Association changed its name to the British Association for Accident and Emergency Medicine, and subsequently became the British Association for Emergency Medicine (BAEM) in 2004. In 1993, an intercollegiate Faculty of Accident and Emergency Medicine (FAEM) was formed as a \"daughter college\" of six medical royal colleges in England and Scotland to arrange professional examinations and training. In 2005, the BAEM and the FAEM were merged to form the College of Emergency Medicine, now the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which conducts membership and fellowship examinations and publishes guidelines and standards for the practise of emergency medicine.\n\nMany hospitals and care centers feature departments of emergency medicine, where patients can receive acute care without an appointment. While many patients are treated for life-threatening injuries, others utilize the emergency department (ED) for non-urgent reasons such as headaches or a cold. (defined as \"visits for conditions for which a delay of several hours would not increase the likelihood of an adverse outcome\"). As such, EDs can adjust staffing ratios and designate an area of the department for faster patient turnover to accommodate a variety of patient needs and volumes. Policies have been developed to better assist ED staff(such as Emergency Medical Technicians, paramedics, and mid level providers such as nurse practitioners and physicians assistants) direct patients towards more appropriate medical settings, such as their primary care physician, urgent care clinics or detoxification facilities. The emergency department, along with welfare programs and healthcare clinics, serves as a critical part of the healthcare safety net for patients who are uninsured, cannot afford medical treatment or do not understand how to properly utilize their coverage.\n\nEmergency physicians are compensated at a higher rate in comparison to some other specialities, ranking 10th out of 26 physician specialties in 2015, at an average salary of $306,000 annually. They are compensated in the mid-range (averaging $13,000 annually) for non-patient activities, such as speaking engagements or acting as an expert witness; they also saw a 12% increase in salary from 2014 – 2015 (which was not out of line with many other physician specialties that year). While emergency physicians work 8–12 hour shifts and do not tend to work on-call, the high level of stress and need for strong diagnostic and triage capabilities for the undifferentiated, acute patient contributes to arguments justifying higher salaries for these physicians. Emergency care must be available every hour of every day, and requires a doctor to be available on site 24/7, unlike an outpatient clinic or some other hospital departments that have more limited hours, and may only call a physician in when needed. The necessity to have a physician on staff along with all other diagnostic services available every hour of every day is thus a costly arrangement for hospitals.\n\nAmerican health payment systems are undergoing significant reform efforts, which include compensating emergency physicians through \"Pay for Performance\" incentives and penalty measures under commercial and public health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. This payment reform aims to improve quality of care and control costs, despite the differing opinions on the existing evidence to show that this payment approach is effective in emergency medicine. Initially, these incentives were only targeted toward primary care providers (PCPs), but some would argue emergency medicine is primary care, as no one refers patients to the ED. In one such program, two specific conditions listed were directly tied to patients frequently seen by emergency medical providers: acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia.(See: Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration.)\n\nThere are some challenges with implementing these quality-based incentives in emergency medicine in that patients are often not given a definitive diagnosis in the ED, making it difficult to allocate payments through coding. Additionally, adjustments based on patient risk-level and multiple co-morbidities for complex patients further complicate attribution of positive or negative health outcomes, and it is difficult to assess whether much of the costs are a direct result of the emergent condition being treated in acute care settings. It is also difficult to quantify the savings due to preventive care during emergency treatment (i.e. workup, stabilizing treatments, coordination of care and discharge, rather than a hospital admission). Thus, ED providers tend to support a modified fee-for-service model over other payment systems.\n\nSome patients without health insurance utilize EDs as their primary form of medical care. Because these patients do not utilize insurance or primary care, emergency medical providers often face problems of overutilization and financial loss, especially since many patients are unable to pay for their care (see below). ED overuse produces $38 billion in wasteful spending each year (i.e. care delivery and coordination failures, over-treatment, administrative complexity, pricing failures, and fraud), and unnecessarily drains departmental resources, reducing the quality of care across all patients. While overuse is not limited to the uninsured, the uninsured comprise a growing proportion of non-urgent ED visits – insurance coverage can help mitigate overutilization by improving access to alternative forms of care and lowering the need for emergency visits. A common misconception pegs frequent ED visitors as a major factor in wasteful spending. However, frequent ED users make up a small portion of those contributing to overutilization and are often insured.\n\nInjury and illness are often unforeseen, and patients of lower socioeconomic status are especially susceptible to being suddenly burdened with the cost of a necessary ED visit. If they are unable to pay for the care they received, then the hospital (which under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), as discussed below, is obligated to treat emergency conditions regardless of ability to pay) faces an economic loss for this uncompensated care. Fifty-five percent of emergency care is uncompensated, and inadequate reimbursement has led to the closure of many EDs. Policy changes (such as the Affordable Care Act) designed to decrease the number of uninsured people have been projected to drastically lower the amount of uncompensated care.\n\nIn addition to decreasing the uninsured rate, ED overutilization might be mitigated by improving patient access to primary care and increasing patient flow to alternative care centers for non-life-threatening injuries. Financial disincentives, patient education, as well as improved management for patients with chronic diseases can also reduce overutilization and help to manage costs of care. Moreover, physician knowledge of prices for treatment and analyses, discussions on costs with their patients, as well as a changing culture away from defensive medicine can improve cost-effective use. A transition towards more value-based care in the ED is an avenue by which providers can contain costs.\n\nDoctors that work in the EDs of hospitals receiving Medicare funding are subject to the provisions of EMTALA. EMTALA was enacted by the US Congress in 1986 to curtail \"patient dumping\", a practice whereby patients were refused medical care for economic or other non-medical reasons. Since its enactment, ED visits have substantially increased, with one study showing a rise in visits of 26% (which is more than double the increase in population over the same period of time). While more individuals are receiving care, a lack of funding and ED overcrowding may be impacting quality. To comply with the provisions of EMTALA, hospitals, through their ED physicians, must provide a medical screening and stabilize the emergency medical conditions of anyone that presents themselves at a hospital ED with patient capacity. If these services are not provided, EMTALA holds both the hospital and the responsible ED physician liable for civil penalties of up to $50,000 each. While both the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) and private citizens can bring an action under EMTALA, courts have uniformly held that ED physicians can only be held liable if the case is prosecuted by OIG (whereas hospitals are subject to penalties regardless of who brings the suit). Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) can discontinue provider status under Medicare for physicians that do not comply with EMTALA. Liability also extends to on-call physicians that fail to respond to an ED request to come to the hospital to provide service. While the goals of EMTALA are laudable, commentators have noted that it appears to have created a substantial unfunded burden on the resources of hospitals and emergency physicians. As a result of financial difficulty, between the period of 1991–2011, 12.6% of EDs in the US closed.\n\nDespite the practice emerging over the past few decades, the delivery of emergency medicine has significantly increased and evolved across diverse settings as it relates to cost, provider availability and overall usage. Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), emergency medicine was leveraged primarily by \"uninsured or underinsured patients, women, children, and minorities, all of whom frequently face barriers to accessing primary care\". While this still exists today to an extent as mentioned above, it is critical to consider the location in which care is delivered to understand the population and system challenges related to overutilization and high cost. In rural communities where provider and ambulatory facility shortages exist, a primary care physician (PCP) in the ED with general knowledge is likely to be the only source of health care for a population, as specialists and other health resources are generally unavailable due to lack of funding and desire to serve in these areas. As a result, the incidence of complex co-morbidities not managed by the appropriate provider results in worse health outcomes and eventually costlier care that extends beyond rural communities. Though typically quite separated, it is crucial that PCPs in rural areas partner with larger health systems to comprehensively address the complex needs of their community, improve population health, and implement strategies such as telemedicine to positively impact health outcomes and reduce ED utilization for preventative illnesses. (See: Rural health.)\n\nAlternatively, emergency medicine in urban areas consists of diverse provider groups including PCPs, nurse practitioners, physicians, and registered nurses who coordinate with specialists in both inpatient and outpatient facilities to address patients’ needs, more specifically in the ED. For all systems regardless of funding source, EMTALA mandates EDs to conduct a medical examination for anyone that presents at the department, irrespective of paying ability. Non-profit hospitals and health systems – as required by the ACA – must provide a certain threshold of charity care \"by actively ensuring that those who qualify for financial assistance get it, by charging reasonable rates to uninsured patients and by avoiding extraordinary collection practices\". While there are limitations, this mandate provides support to many in need. That said, despite policy efforts and increased funding and federal reimbursement in urban areas, the triple aim (of improving patient experience, enhancing population health, and reducing the per-capita cost of care) remains a challenge without providers' and payers' collaboration to increase access to preventive care and decrease in ED usage. As a result, many experts support the notion that emergency medical services should serve only immediate risks in both urban and rural areas.\n\nAs stated above, EMTALA includes provisions that protect patients from being turned away or transferred before adequate stabilization. Upon making contact with a patient, EMS providers have a responsibility to diagnose and stabilize a patient’s condition without regard for ability to pay. In the prehospital setting, providers must exercise appropriate judgement in choosing a suitable hospital for transport. Hospitals can only turn away incoming ambulances if they are on diversion and incapable of providing adequate care. However, once a patient has arrived on hospital property, care must be provided. At the hospital, contact with the patient is first made by a triage nurse who determines the appropriate level of care needed.\n\nAccording to the Mead v. Legacy Health System, a patient-physician relationship is established when \"the physician takes an affirmative action with regard to the care of the patient\". Initiating such a relationship forms a legal contract in which the physician must continue to provide treatment or properly terminate the relationship. This legal responsibility can extend to physician consultations and on-call physicians even without direct patient contact. In emergency medicine, termination of the patient-provider relationship prior to stabilization or without handoff to another qualified provider is considered abandonment. In order to initiate an outside transfer, a physician must verify that the next hospital can provide a similar or higher level of care. Hospitals and physicians must also ensure that the patient’s condition will not be further aggravated by the transfer process.\n\nThe unique setting of emergency medicine practice presents a challenge for delivering high quality, patient-centered care. Clear, effective communication can be particularly difficult due to noise, frequent interruptions, and high patient turnover. The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine has identified five tasks that are essential to patient-physician communication: establishing rapport, gathering information, giving information, providing comfort, and collaboration. The miscommunication of patient information is a key source of medical error; minimizing shortcoming in communication remains a topic of current and future research.\n\nMany circumstances, including the regular transfer of patients in the course of emergency treatment, and crowded, noisy and chaotic ED environments, make emergency medicine particularly susceptible to medical error and near misses. One study identified an error rate of 18 per 100 registered patients in one particular academic ED. Another study found that where a lack of teamwork (i.e. poor communication, lack of team structure, lack of cross-monitoring) was implicated in a particular incident of ED medical error, \"an average of 8.8 teamwork failures occurred per case [and] more than half of the deaths and permanent disabilities that occurred were judged avoidable.\" Unfortunately, certain cultural (i.e. \"a focus on the errors of others and a ‘blame-and-shame’ culture\") and structural (i.e. lack of standardization and equipment incompatibilities) aspects of emergency medicine often result in a lack of disclosure of medical error and near misses to patients and other caregivers. While concerns about malpractice liability is one reason why disclosure of medical errors is not made, some have noted that disclosing the error and providing an apology can mitigate malpractice risk. Ethicists uniformly agree that the disclosure of a medical error that causes harm is the duty of a care provider. The key components of disclosure include \"honesty, explanation, empathy, apology, and the chance to lessen the chance of future errors\" (represented by the mnemonic HEEAL). The nature of emergency medicine is such that error will likely always be a substantial risk of emergency care. Maintaining public trust through open communication regarding harmful error, however, can help patients and physicians constructively address problems when they occur.\n\nEmergency Medicine is a primary, or first-contact point of care for patients requiring the use of the health care system. Specialists in Emergency Medicine are required to possess specialist skills in acute illness diagnosis and resuscitation. Emergency physicians are responsible for providing immediate recognition, evaluation, care, stabilization, to adult and pediatric patients in response to acute illness and injury.\n\nThere are a variety of international models for emergency medicine training. Among those with well developed training programs there are two different models: a \"specialist\" model or \"a multidisciplinary model\". Additionally, in some countries the emergency medicine specialist rides in the ambulance. For example, in France and Germany the physician, often an anesthesiologist, rides in the ambulance and provides stabilizing care at the scene. The patient is then triaged to the appropriate department of a hospital, so emergency care is much more multidisciplinary than in the Anglo-American model.\n\nIn countries such as the US, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, ambulances crewed by paramedics and emergency medical technicians respond to out-of-hospital emergencies and transport patients to emergency departments, meaning there is more dependence on these health-care providers and there is more dependence on paramedics and EMTs for on-scene care. Emergency physicians are therefore more \"specialists\", since all patients are taken to the emergency department. Most developing countries follow the Anglo-American model: 3 or 4 year independent residency training programs in emergency medicine are the gold standard. Some countries develop training programs based on a primary care foundation with additional emergency medicine training. In developing countries, there is an awareness that Western models may not be applicable and may not be the best use of limited health care resources. For example, specialty training and pre-hospital care like that in developed countries is too expensive and impractical for use in many developing countries with limited health care resources. International emergency medicine provides an important global perspective and hope for improvement in these areas.\n\nA brief review of some of these programs follows:\n\nIn Argentina, the SAE (Sociedad Argentina de Emergencias) is the main organization of Emergency Medicine. There are a lot of residency programs. Also it is possible to reach the certification with a two-year postgraduate university course after a few years of ED background.\n\nThe specialist medical college responsible for Emergency Medicine in Australia and New Zealand is the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM). The training program is nominally seven years in duration, after which the trainee is awarded a Fellowship of ACEM, conditional upon passing all necessary assessments.\n\nDual fellowship programs also exist for Paediatric Medicine (in conjunction with the Royal Australasian College of Physicians) and Intensive Care Medicine (in conjunction with the College of Intensive Care Medicine). These programs nominally add one or more years to the ACEM training program.\n\nFor medical doctors not (and not wishing to be) specialists in Emergency Medicine but have a significant interest or workload in emergency departments, the ACEM provides non-specialist certificates and diplomas.\n\nIn Chile, Emergency and Emergency Medicine begins its journey with the first specialty program at the beginning of the 90s, at the University of Chile. Currently it is a primary specialty legally recognized by the Ministry of Health since 2013, and has multiple training programs for specialists, notably those of the University of Chile, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, San Sebastian University - MUE and University of Santiago of Chile (USACH).Currently, and with the aim of strengthening the specialty at the country level, FOAMed initiatives have emerged (free open access medical education in emergency medicine) and the #ChileEM initiative that brings together the programs of the Universidad San Sebastián / MUE, Universidad Católica de Chile and Universidad de Chile, with the objective of holding joint clinical meetings between the main training programs, on a regular basis and open to all the health team working in the field of urgency. The specialists already trained are grouped in the Chilean Society of Emergency Medicine (SOCHIMU).\n\nThe two routes to emergency medicine certification can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nCCFP(EM) emergency physicians outnumber FRCP(EM) physicians by a ratio of about 3 to 1, and they tend to work primarily as clinicians with a smaller focus on academic activities such as teaching and research. FRCP(EM) Emergency Medicine Board specialists tend to congregate in academic centers and tend to have more academically oriented careers, which emphasize administration, research, critical care, disaster medicine, and teaching. They also tend to sub-specialize in toxicology, critical care, pediatrics emergency medicine, and sports medicine. Furthermore, the length of the FRCP(EM) residency allows more time for formal training in these areas.\n\nThe current post-graduate Emergency Medicine training process is highly complex in China. The first EM post-graduate training took place in 1984 at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Because specialty certification in EM has not been established, formal training is not required to practice Emergency Medicine in China.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Emergency Medicine residency training was centralized at the municipal levels, following the guidelines issued by The Ministry of Public Health. Residency programs in all hospitals are called residency training bases, which have to be approved by local health governments. These bases are hospital-based, but the residents are selected and managed by the municipal associations of medical education. These associations are also the authoritative body of setting up their residents' training curriculum. All medical school graduates wanting to practice medicine have to go through 5 years of residency training at designated training bases, first 3 years of general rotation followed by 2 more years of specialty-centered training.\n\nIn Germany, emergency medicine is not handled as a specialisation (Facharztrichtung), but any licensed physician can acquire an additional qualification in emergency medicine through an 80-hour course monitored by the respective \"\"Ärztekammer\"\" (medical association, responsible for licensing of physicians). A service as emergency physician in an ambulance service is part of the specialisation training of anaesthesiology. Emergency physicians usually work on a volunteering basis and are often anaesthesiologists, but may be specialists of any kind. Especially there is a specialisation training in pediatric intensive care.\n\nIndia is an example of how family medicine can be a foundation for emergency medicine training. Many private hospitals and institutes have been providing Emergency Medicine training for doctors, nurses & paramedics since 1994, with certification programs varying from 6 months to 3 years. However, emergency medicine was only recognized as a separate specialty by the Medical Council of India in July 2009.\n\nThere are three universities (Universiti Sains Malaysia, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, & Universiti Malaya) that offer master's degrees in emergency medicine – postgraduate training programs of four years in duration with clinical rotations, examinations and a dissertation. The first cohort of locally trained emergency physicians graduated in 2002.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Certification of Emergency Medicine is done by taking the 4-year program Saudi Board of Emergency Medicine (SBEM), which is accredited by Saudi Council for Health Specialties (SCFHS). It requires passing the two-part exam: first part and final part (written and oral) to obtain the SBEM certificate, which is equivalent to Doctorate Degree.\n\nMost programs are three years in duration, but some programs are four years long. There are several combined residencies offered with other programs including family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics. The US is well known for its excellence in emergency medicine residency training programs. This has led to some controversy about specialty certification.\n\nThere are three ways to become board-certified in emergency medicine:\n\n\nA number of ABMS fellowships are available for Emergency Medicine graduates including pre-hospital medicine (emergency medical services), critical care, hospice and palliative care, research, undersea and hyperbaric medicine, sports medicine, pain medicine, ultrasound, pediatric Emergency Medicine, disaster medicine, wilderness medicine, toxicology, and critical care medicine.\n\nIn recent years, workforce data has led to a recognition of the need for additional training for primary care physicians who provide emergency care. This has led to a number of supplemental training programs in first-hour emergency care, and a few fellowships for family physicians in emergency medicine.\n\n\"In 2010, there were 157 allopathic and 37 osteopathic emergency medicine residency programs, which collectively accept about 2,000 new residents each year. Studies have shown that attending emergency physician supervision of residents directly correlates to a higher quality and more cost-effective practice, especially when an emergency medicine residency exists.\" Medical education is primarily funded through the Medicare program; payments are given to hospitals for each resident. \"Fifty-five percent of ED payments come from Medicare, fifteen percent from Medicaid, five percent from private payment and twenty-five percent from commercially insured patients.\" However, choices of physician specialties are not mandated by any agency or program, so even though emergency departments see many Medicare/Medicaid patients, and thus receive a lot of funding for training from these programs, there is still concern over a shortage of specialty-trained Emergency Medicine providers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has a role in setting the professional standards and the assessment of trainees. Emergency medical trainees enter specialty training after five or six years of Medical school followed by two years of foundation training. Specialty training takes six years to complete and success in the assessments and a set of five examinations results in the award of Fellowship of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (FRCEM).\n\nHistorically, emergency specialists were drawn from anaesthesia, medicine, and surgery. Many established EM consultants were surgically trained; some hold the Fellowship of Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in Accident and Emergency — FRCSEd(A&E). Trainees in Emergency Medicine may dual accredit in Intensive care medicine or seek sub-specialisation in Paediatric Emergency Medicine.\n\nEmergency Medicine residency lasts for 4 years in Turkey. These physicians have a 2-year Obligatory Service in Turkey to be qualified to have their diploma. After this period, EM specialist can choose to work in private or governmental ED's.\n\nThe college of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan accredited the training in Emergency Medicine in 2010. Emergency Medicine training in Pakistan lasts for 5 years. The initial 2 years involve trainees to be sent to three major areas which include Medicine and allied, Surgery and Allied and critical care. It is divided into six months each and the rest six months out of first two years are spent in emergency department. In last three years trainee residents spend most of their time in emergency room as senior residents. Certificate courses include ACLS, PALS, ATLS, and research and dissertations are required for successful completion of the training. At the end of 5 years, candidates become eligible for sitting for FCPS part II exam. After fulfilling the requirement they become fellow of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan in Emergency Medicine ().\n\nPresently there are seven institutions where you can acquire this training which includes Shifa International Hospitals Islamabad, Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, POF hospital Wah, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Indus Hospital Karachi and Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center Karachi. There are approximately 70 residents in different years of training. The list of Physicians cleared their exam from the College of Physicians and Surgeon Pakistan can be seen here ().\n\nThe first residency program in Iran started in 2002 at Iran University of Medical Sciences, and there are now three-year standard residency programs running in Tehran, Tabriz, Mashhad, Isfahan, and some other universities. All these programs work under supervision of Emergency Medicine specialty board committee. There are now more than 200 (and increasing) board-certified Emergency Physicians in Iran.\n\nEthical and medico-legal issues are embedded within the nature of Emergency Medicine. Issues surrounding competence, end of life care, and right to refuse care are encountered on a daily basis within the Emergency Department. Of growing significance are the ethical issues and legal obligations that surround the Mental Health Act, as increasing numbers of suicide attempts and self-harm are seen in the Emergency Department The Wooltorton case of 2007 in which a patient arrived at the Emergency Department post overdose with a note specifying her request for no interventions, highlights the dichotomy that often exists between a physicians ethical obligation to 'do no harm' and the legality of a patients right to refuse.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52977", "title": "Clinical neurophysiology", "text": "Clinical neurophysiology\n\nClinical neurophysiology is a medical specialty that studies the central and peripheral nervous systems through the recording of bioelectrical activity, whether spontaneous or stimulated. It encompasses both research regarding the pathophysiology along with clinical methods used to diagnose diseases involving both central and peripheral nervous systems. \nExaminations in the clinical neurophysiology field are not limited to tests conducted in a laboratory. It is thought of as an extension of a neurologic consultation. Tests that are conducted are concerned with measuring the electrical functions of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves in the limbs and muscles. It can give the precise definition of site, the type and degree of the lesion, along with revealing the abnormalities that are in question. Due to these abilities, clinical neurophysiology is used to mainly help diagnose diseases rather than treat them.\n\nIn some countries it is a part of neurology or psychiatry, for example the United States and Germany. In other countries it is an autonomous specialty, such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden and Norway.\n\nHospitals that have neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to house clinical neurophysiology departments. Usually these tend to be larger hospitals that are able to employ more specialized staff units. In hospitals that possess clinical neurophysiology facilities, the major diagnostic modalities employed include:\n\nThe pathway to becoming a clinical neurophysiologist in the U.S. includes completing an undergraduate degree, medical school, and postgraduate medical education, usually in neurology. Following the completion of an accredited residency program, clinicians may choose to enter a fellowship in Clinical Neurophysiology. Programs may expose their fellows to the broad spectrum of electrodiagnostic neurophysiologic studies, or may focus on a single area such as EEG or electrodiagnostic medicine. Clinical neurophysiology fellowships are generally 1–2 years in duration and may lead to board certification in one or more subspecialty areas.\n\nThere are two healthcare professionals who typically perform neurophysiological investigations in the UK. These are medical staff trained in clinical neurophysiology, and clinical physiologists who undertake four years of practical training whilst undertaking an honours degree. Physiologists perform the majority of EEGs, evoked potentials and a portion of the nerve conduction studies. They are then clinically reported either by the physiology staff or the medical staff. Their professional organisations are the British Society for Clinical Neurophysiology and the Association of Neurophysiological Scientists\n\nElectrodiagnostic medicine is a subset of clinical neurophysiology. Electrodiagnostic medicine focuses only on the peripheral nervous system and not the central nervous system. Whereas a clinical neurophysiologist is trained to perform all the following studies EEG, intraoperative monitoring, nerve conduction studies, EMG and evoked potentials, and electrodiagnostic physician focuses mainly on nerve conduction studies, needle EMG, and evoked potentials. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology provides certification examination in clinical neurophysiology. The American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine provides certification in EDX medicines. The American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology certifies in electroencephalography (EEG), Evoked Potentials (EP), Polysomnography (PSG), Epilepsy Monitoring, and Neurologic Intraoperative Monitoring (NIOM). In the US physicians typically specialize in EEG or EDX medicine but not both.\n\nHospitals that have neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to house clinical neurophysiology departments. Usually these tend to be larger hospitals that are able to employ more specialized staff units. \nClinical neurophysiologists are responsible for analyzing and writing reports on tests that take place within the department. They must also interpret the results that they receive and convey this information to the doctor that referred the patient to the particular neurophysiologist. Many tests involve carrying out an EMG to read the evoked potential recordings. Nerve conduction recordings are extremely common as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53903", "title": "Giant", "text": "Giant\n\nGiants (from Latin and Ancient Greek: \"gigas\", cognate giga-) are beings of human appearance, but of prodigious size and strength common in the mythology and legends of many different cultures. The word \"giant\", first attested in 1297, was derived from the \"Gigantes\" () of Greek mythology.\n\nIn various Indo-European mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild nature, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian, Celtic, Hindu or Norse. Giants also often play similar roles in the mythologies and folklore of other, non Indo-European peoples, such as in the Nartian traditions.\n\nThere are also accounts of giants in the Old Testament. Some of these are called Nephilim, a word often translated as giant although this translation is not universally accepted. They include Og King of Bashan, the Nephilim, the Anakim, and the giants of Egypt mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11:23. The first mention of the Nephilim is found in Genesis 6:4; attributed to them are extraordinary strength and physical proportions.\n\nFairy tales such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\" have formed the modern perception of giants as stupid and violent monsters, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat the livestock. The antagonist in \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is often described as a giant. In some more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly.\n\nGenesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah's Flood. According to Genesis 7:23, the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including:\n\nThe Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies which Moses sent into Canaan: “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.” However, the Book of Joshua, describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes no reference to such people living there.\n\nThe Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he is much smaller than other biblical giants. The 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, and the 1st-2nd-century BC Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span,\" approximately 2.00 m or about six feet seven inches. The King James translation of the Bible reports the giant Goliath as \"six cubits and a span\" in height—about nine feet nine inches tall, (over 2.75 m) ( KJV), but the Septuagint, a Greek Bible, gives Goliath's height as \"four cubits and a span\" (~2.00 m). For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers. See also Gibborim.\n\nJosephus also described the Amorites as giants in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\", circa 93 AD, indicating that fossil evidence still remained at that time: \"For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.\"\n\nIn Islam, giants known as \"jababirat\" or \"jabbirun\" ( \"tyrants\" or \"giants\"; singular, ) such as Jalut (Goliath) are mentioned, as well as ‘Uj ibn Anaq.\n\nThe Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in 7:2.\n\nHayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the tower of Babel. Ancient historian Movses Khorenatsi wrote, \"Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.\"\n\nMount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.\n\nAccording to Baltic mythology, the playing of a giantess named Neringa on the seashore formed the Curonian Spit (\"neria, nerge, neringia\" means land which is diving up and down like a swimmer). This character also appears in other myths (in some of which she is shown as a young strong woman, similar to a female version of the Greek Heracles). \"Neringa\" is the name of a modern town on the spot.\n\nGiants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living up the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old life style and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots.\n\nHowever, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun ('the lord of the forests'), Sanson (development of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops).\n\nIn Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of tripping and dying, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.\n\nIn Greek mythology the \"Gigantes\" (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the \"Gigantomachy\" (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lay buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nHerodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes which was seven cubits long—around 10 feet (3 meters). In his book \"The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus\" Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was \"of more than ordinary size\". The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about twelve centimeters in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around five centimeters, suggesting Ajax may have been around 14 feet (~4.3 meters) tall.\n\nThe Cyclopes, usually children of Gods (Olympians) and nature spirits (nereids, naiads and dryads), are also compared to giants due to their huge size (Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa, and nemesis of Odysseus, comes to mind). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus where they later made Zeus' Master Thunderbolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness during the Titanomachy.\n\nThe Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nOther known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians.\n\nIn Hinduism, the giants are called Daityas. The Daityas (दैत्य) were the children of Diti and the sage Kashyapa who fought against the gods or Devas because they were jealous of their Deva half-brothers. Since Daityas were a power-seeking race, they sometimes allied with other races having similar ideology namely Danavas and Asuras. Daityas along with Danavas and Asuras are sometimes called Rakshasas, the generic term for a demon in Hindu mythology. Some known Daityas include Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The main antagonist of the Hindu epic Ramayana, Ravana, was a Brahmin from his father's side and a Daitya from his mother's side. His younger brother Kumbhakarna was said to be as tall as a mountain and was quite good natured.\n\nAccording to Jains, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth. Jain cosmology divides worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, \"avasarpani\" (age of descending purity) and ascending (\"utsarpani\").\n\nAccording to Jain texts, the height of Rishabha, first \"tirthankara\" of present half cycle of time (\"avasarpani\") was 500 \"dhanusa\" (longbow).\nIn \"avasarpani\", as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six \"aras\" of \"avasarpini\"–\nAccording to Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave. Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.\n\nAdrienne Mayor writes about the Si-Te-Cah in her book, \"Legends of the First Americans\". She suggests that the 'giant' interpretation of the skeletons from Lovelock Cave and other dry caves in Nevada was started by entrepreneurs setting up tourist displays and that the skeletons themselves were of normal size. However, about a hundred miles north of Lovelock there are plentiful fossils of mammoths and cave bears, and their large limb bones could easily be thought to be those of giants by an untrained observer. She also discusses the reddish hair, pointing out that hair pigment is not stable after death and that various factors such as temperature, soil, etc. can turn ancient very dark hair rusty red or orange.\n\nAztec mythology features the Quinametzin, a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras. They are credited for the construction of Teotihuacan.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the Jotun (\"jötnar\" in Old Norse, a cognate with \"ettin\") are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as frost giants (\"hrímþursar\"), fire giants (\"eldjötnar\"), and mountain giants (\"bergrisar\").\n\nThe giants are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr), and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök the giants will storm Asgard and fight them, until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the giants by many marriages, and there are giants such as Ægir, Loki, Mímir, and Skaði, who bear little difference in status to them. The Chief God Odin was the great-grand son of the Giant Ymir.\n\nNorse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions, which name is considered by some to share a root with the name Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology.\n\nAn old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"Old Hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago.\n\nA \"bergrisi\" – the traditional Protector of Southwestern Iceland – appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland.\n\nSeveral Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a Giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura and Alsace.\n\nIn folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. Saxo Grammaticus, for example, argues that giants had to exist, because nothing else would explain the large walls, stone monuments, and statues that we now know were the remains of Roman construction. Similarly, the Old English poem \"Seafarer\" speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Even natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants. Giants provided the least complicated explanation for such artifacts.\n\nMedieval romances such as the Spanish \"Amadis de Gaula\" feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\", when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills.\n\nTales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances perhaps as a reflection of the Nordic and Slavic mythology that arrived on the boats, and from this source they spread into the heroic tales of Torquato Tasso, Ludovico Ariosto, and their follower Edmund Spenser. In the small Scottish village of Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth to this effect concerns a local hill that apparently resembles the head, shoulders, and torso of a man, and has therefore been termed 'the sleeping giant'. Apparently the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Other giants, perhaps descended from earlier Germanic mythology, feature as frequent opponents of Dietrich von Bern in medieval German tales – in later portrayals Dietrich himself and his fellow heroes also became giants.\n\nMany giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity. A giant who had quarreled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.\n\nOther English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other. This was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.\n\nGiants figure in a great many fairy tales and folklore stories, such as \"Jack the Giant Killer\", \"The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body\", \"Nix Nought Nothing\", \"Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon\", \"Young Ronald\", and Paul Bunyan. Ogres and trolls are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. An example of another, Slavic, folklore giant is Rübezahl, a kind giant from Wendish folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains (nowadays on the Czech–Polish border). Additionally, mythological beings which are not necessarily considered giants in the common sense can be characterized by a giant-like body size, e.g. the Bergmönch, a German mountain spirit.\n\nIn Kalevala, Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that possesses mighty spells dating to the creation. Epic hero Väinämöinen sets out to learn these spells from him, but Vipunen is buried underground, and when Väinämöinen digs him out, he is accidentally swallowed by Vipunen. Väinämöinen then forces Vipunen to submit and sing the spells out by hammering his insides. An analysis by Martti Haavio is that Vipunen is not physically large, but his familiar animal (astral form) is a whale. The depiction is not found in the majority of Finnish original stories, and most probably originates from the book's compiler Elias Lönnrot.\n\nThrough the centuries, certain archaeologists have searched for fossil evidence of a race of giants. Alleged evidence includes:\n\n"}
{"id": "54034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54034", "title": "Misznay–Schardin effect", "text": "Misznay–Schardin effect\n\nThe Misznay–Schardin effect (correct spelling Misnay–Schardin), or platter effect, is a characteristic of the detonation of a broad sheet of explosive. The explosive blast expands directly away from and perpendicular to the surface of an explosive. Unlike the blast from a rounded explosive charge, which expands in all directions, the blast produced by an explosive sheet expands primarily perpendicular to its plane, in both directions. However, if one side is backed by a heavy or fixed mass, most of the blast (that is, most of the rapidly expanding gas and its kinetic energy) will be sent in the direction away from the mass.\n\nThis effect was studied and experimented with by explosive experts József Misnay (alternative - and wrong - spelling Misznay), a Hungarian, and Hubert Schardin, a German, who initially sought to develop a more effective anti-tank (AT) mine for Nazi Germany. Some sources claim World War II ended before their design became usable, but they and others continued their work. Misnay designed two weapons: The 43M TAK was an AT mine, the 44M LŐTAK was a side-attack mine. The Hungarian army used these weapons in 1944–1945.\n\nThe AT2 and M18 Claymore mines rely on this effect.\n\n"}
{"id": "54566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54566", "title": "7 Up", "text": "7 Up\n\n7 Up (stylized as 7up outside the U.S.) is a brand of lemon-lime-flavored non-caffeinated soft drink. The rights to the brand are held by Keurig Dr Pepper in the United States and by PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world. The U.S. version of the \"7 Up\" logo includes a red circle between the \"7\" and \"Up\"; this red circle has been animated and used as a mascot for the brand as Cool Spot.\n\n7 Up was created by Charles Leiper Grigg, who launched his St. Louis–based company The Howdy Corporation in 1920. Grigg came up with the formula for a lemon-lime soft drink in 1929. The product, originally named \"Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda\", was launched two weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948. It was one of a number of patent medicine products popular in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Its name was later shortened to \"7 Up Lithiated Lemon Soda\" before being further shortened to just \"7 Up\" by 1936.\n\nA myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, similar to other drinks of the type. The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7. Britvic also claims that the name be a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles (Coca-Cola and most other soft drinks were bottled in 6-ounce bottles).\n\nWestinghouse bought 7 Up in 1969 and sold it in 1978 to Philip Morris, who then in 1986 sold it in two parts: the international division to Pepsico and the U.S. business to a group led by the investment firm Hicks & Haas. In the U.S., 7 Up merged with Dr Pepper in 1988; Cadbury Schweppes bought the combined company in 1995. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008; it merged with Keurig Green Mountain in 2018 to form Keurig Dr Pepper.\n\n7 Up has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929. In 2006, the version of the product sold in the U.S. was reformulated so it could be marketed as being \"100% natural\". This was achieved by eliminating the chelating agent calcium disodium EDTA, and replacing sodium citrate with potassium citrate to reduce the beverage's sodium content. This reformulation contains no fruit juice and, in the U.S., is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The manufacturing process used in the production of HFCS has led some public health and advocacy groups to challenge the ad campaign's \"natural\" claims. In 2007, after the Center for Science in the Public Interest threatened to sue 7 Up, it was announced that 7 Up would stop being marketed as \"100% natural\". Instead, it is now promoted as having \"100% Natural Flavors\". The controversy does not extend to other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where HFCS is not generally used in foods, including 7 Up. In 2011, 7 Up began test marketing a formula, called 7 Up Retro, using sugar rather than HFCS. Container labels sport the caption, \"Made With Real Sugar\".\n\n7 Up Ten: Introduced in 2013, along with \"Ten\" variations for most of the major Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up brands, this contains 10 calories. It is a blend using high fructose corn syrup along with aspartame and acesulfame potassium to sweeten it.\n\nTropical 7 Up: Introduced in 2014 for a limited time, as well as a return in 2015 with newer branding, this is a pineapple/mango-flavored 7 Up.\n\n7 Up Retro: This 2011 formulation uses sugar rather than HFCS as its sweetener. Introduced on the 2011 season finale of \"The Apprentice\", packaging in 12-oz. cans features either the 1970s disco mirrorball-themed logo or the 1980s logo. It is also available in 12-oz. glass bottles with a label inspired by 7 Up's original logo.\n\nDiet 7 Up: This diet soda was originally introduced in 1963 as Like (not to be confused with 7 Up's Like Cola from the 1980s), it was discontinued in 1969 due to the U.S. government ban of cyclamate sweetener. After reformulation, it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970. It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979. Diet 7 Up was reformulated and advertised as being sweetened with Splenda (sucralose); the formula has been retooled and listed these ingredients: filtered carbonated water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium citrate, potassium benzoate, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, calcium disodium EDTA. The ingredients for Diet 7 Up with Splenda are: filtered carbonated water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium citrate, potassium benzoate, calcium disodium EDTA, acesulfame potassium, sucralose. The 7 Up Company claims they switched back to aspartame because they conducted a nationwide study showing that people preferred the taste with aspartame instead of with Splenda.\nCherry 7 Up: A cherry-flavored variant, it was introduced in 1987. Cherry 7 Up flavor, with these ingredients listed for the United States version: Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, potassium benzoate, red 40. One known ingredient among the \"natural and artificial flavors\" is apple juice. The version sold in the United States is colored pink and comes in a clear bottle, while the international version is colorless and currently comes in a pink bottle. It was renamed and reformulated as Cherry 7 Up Antioxidant in January 2009. It contains 10% of U.S. daily recommended vitamin E dosage per 8 fl oz serving . On November 8, 2012, Keurig Dr Pepper said they will pull 7 Up with antioxidants off the shelves to reformulate them by 2013. They also said that its decision was not related to the lawsuit, but because of consistency across the board.\n\nDiet Cherry 7 Up: Diet Cherry 7 Up has recently been reintroduced due to popular demand after having been missing due to the existence of 7 Up Plus Cherry flavor. Ingredients are: filtered carbonated water and contains 2% or less of each of the following: citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, potassium benzoate (protects flavor), aspartame, potassium citrate, acesulfame potassium, red 40. Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.\n\nOrange 7 Up: This flavor was available for a short time in Norway during the mid-1990s. It was released at the same time as Raspberry 7 Up. It was a clear-colored lemon-, lime-, and orange-flavored soft drink. It was pulled off the market after 2–3 years. Today, Orange 7 Up can still be bought in Austria. , it is available in the Netherlands.\n\nRaspberry 7 Up: This flavor was available for a short time in Norway and Denmark (and possibly other European countries) during the late '80s. It was released at the same time as Orange 7 Up. It was a clear lemon-, lime-, and raspberry-flavoured soft drink. It was pulled off the European market after 2–3 years, but can still be found in several Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore.\n\n7 Up Free: 7 Up Free is sold in Iceland, UK, Ireland, Spain, Norway, Argentina, Finland, UAE, Uruguay, Pakistan, and the Netherlands. It contains no caffeine, sugar, colorings, or preservatives, and is marketed as \"Natural Lemon and Lime Flavour\" similar to the \"100% natural\" American version. It contains a combination of artificial sugars, and for eight years was the only variety on the Norwegian market. The lack of the usual light or zero-label is confusing to Norwegian consumers, who often buy it not knowing they are buying a product with artificial sugars. In the UK, 7 Up Free has been sold in a 600-ml, rather than 500-ml bottle since early 2010. This is part of 7 Up's UK manufacturer Britvic's healthy-living push whereby sugar-free product versions are sold in a larger bottle.\n\n7 Up Light: In international markets, Pepsico sells 7 Up Light as the diet version of 7 Up.\n\n7 Up Lime: 7 Up Lime is sold in the U.S. and Argentina. In the U.S., it is not as strong and is less carbonated. In Argentina, it is much more carbonated and has 5% lime juice.\n\n7 Up Cherry: 7 Up Cherry is a variant currently available in the UK and France. It is a different drink from Cherry 7 Up and uses a different recipe.\n7 UP Revive: 7UP Revive is a variant of the 7 UP brand which is available in India (launched in 2015) and Laos and is marketed as a hydrotonic.\n\nSalted Lemon 7 Up: Salted Lemon 7 Up is a drink originating in Hong Kong, which is made of salted lemon and 7 Up. It is a common drink that can be found in dai pai dong and cha chaan teng. It is also named one of the Hong Kong summer drinks by Cathay Pacific Discovery.\n\n7 Up Mojito Flavour: This flavour was launched in France in 2014 and has also been available in the UK and Ireland since early 2016. The version sold in the UK is based on 7 Up Free and contains no sugar, colour, or caffeine.\n\nIn 2007, Cadbury Schweppes entered into a licensing partnership with Vita Food Products to produce a line of barbecue sauces and marinades flavored with Dr Pepper, 7 Up, and A&W Root Beer.\n\n7 Up Gold: 7 Up Gold was marketed for a short time in 1988 as a spice-flavored beverage, similar to Vernor's Ginger Ale. Though 7 Up's marketing slogan at that time was \"Never Had It, Never Will\" (referring to caffeine), 7 Up Gold included caffeine as an ingredient. It was introduced by 7 Up in the hopes of capturing 1% of the cola market, which at the time was $26.6 billion. However, it only captured 0.1% of the market because people were confused by 7 Up marketing a dark-colored soft drink with caffeine, so it was discontinued. The 7 Up Gold recipe was actually an unused Dr Pepper invention.\n\n7 Up Ice Cola: Introduced in 1995 by Pepsi for the international market, it was a clear cola, in essence a repackaging of Crystal Pepsi. It was not as popular as hoped and was discontinued.\n\ndnL / 7 Upside Down: dnL was the name of a soft drink produced by Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages in the United States. It was part of the 7 Up family of soft drinks, and was introduced in September 2002. It was launched in the same year as other attempts to extend soft drink brand names with new variations, including Pepsi Blue, Dr Pepper Red Fusion, and Vanilla Coke. It was arguably poorly marketed, and while it remained listed as an official product of the company in late 2005, it was scheduled to be discontinued for 2006 in favor of the \"7 Up Plus\" brand.\nThe product's name came from the fact that the \"dnL\" logo is the \"7 Up\" logo turned upside down. The product itself was also, in many ways, the opposite of 7 Up: while 7 Up is caffeine-free, colorless, and comes in a green bottle, dnL contained caffeine and was an unusual shade of green (vaguely similar to the green of 7 Up's bottle) in a clear bottle. And while 7 Up has a fairly standard lemon-lime flavor, the \"citrus\" flavor of dnL is that of lime-lemon, (primarily lime flavored with a hint of lemon).\n\n7 Up Citrus Splash: Available in Canada from Pepsico, citrus and lemon-lime.\n\n7 Up Lemon Squeeze: Available in Canada from Pepsico, similar to Sierra Mist Lemon Squeeze\n\n7 Up Tropical: Available in France from Pepsico\n\n7 Up Tropical Splash: Available in Canada from Pepsico in the early 2000s.\n\n7 Up Plus: 7 Up Plus was a family of fruit-flavored soft drinks, produced by Cadbury-Schweppes. Touted as a healthy alternative, it contained no caffeine and has 2 grams of carbohydrates per serving, as well as 5% apple juice, which is uncommon among American market carbonated beverages. It is sweetened with Splenda, and the original flavor, Mixed Berry, was released in summer 2004. Two additional flavors have been added to the line: Cherry and Island Fruit. In Ireland in 2007, 7 Up launched a range of flavored water.\n\n7 Up Pomegranate: Available in the U.S. once a year during the holidays\n\n7 Up Frootaz: Tropical flavor variant available in the Philippines marketed by Pepsico for a short time in the 2000s, and then discontinued\n\n7 Up Yerbabuena: Available for a limited time only in Colombia in 2013\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Geoffrey Holder appeared in television ads as part of 7 Up's \"Uncola\" ad campaign, designed to highlight differences between 7 Up and other soft drinks on the market with cola flavoring. In the ads, Geoffrey holds a pair of cola nuts in one hand and a lemon & lime (used to flavor 7 Up) in the other hand and describes them as \"Uncola nuts.\" \n\nThe television cartoon character Fido Dido was used as a mascot from the late 1980s through the early 1990s, and was reintroduced in international markets in the early 2000s.\n\nFresh-Up Freddie was the rooster mascot for 7 Up in the 1950s. He gave viewers lessons about how to plan successful parties and picnics by having a plenty of 7 Up on hand. The commercials were produced by Disney, giving the character the specific Disney look of the time. Freddie has been described as a hybrid of the rooster Panchito Pistoles from \"The Three Caballeros\" and the zany Aracuan Bird from the same film. He often was dressed in human clothes. Freddie also appeared in the 1957 \"Zorro\" TV series' commercial intermissions. Here, he was put against Pete the Cat. Freddie, who was featured in a small amount of merchandising, was voiced by Paul Frees.\n\n"}
{"id": "54578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54578", "title": "RC Cola", "text": "RC Cola\n\nRC Cola, short for Royal Crown Cola, is a cola-flavored soft drink developed in 1905 by Claud A. Hatcher, a pharmacist in Columbus, Georgia, United States of America.\n\nIn 1901, the Cole-Hampton-Hatcher Grocery Store was established in Columbus, Georgia. In 1903, the Hatcher family took sole ownership and the name was changed to the Hatcher Grocery Store. The grocery store was located at what was 22 West 10th Street. Today's address (after house number changes) is 15 West 10th Street. At that same time, the popularity of bottled soft drinks rose rapidly, and grocery store owners wished to maximize their profit. As a grocery wholesaler, Claud A. Hatcher purchased a large volume of Coca-Cola syrup from the local company salesman, Columbus Roberts. Hatcher felt that the company deserved a special reduced price for the syrup since it purchased such large volumes. Roberts would not budge on the cost, and a bitter conflict between the two erupted. Hatcher told Roberts he would win the battle by never purchasing any more Coca-Cola, and Hatcher determined to develop his own soft drink formula. He started developing products in the basement of the store with a recipe for ginger ale.\n\nHatcher launched the Union Bottling Works in his family's grocery store. The first product in the Royal Crown line was Royal Crown Ginger Ale in 1905, followed by Royal Crown Strawberry, and Royal Crown Root Beer. The company was renamed Chero-Cola in 1910, and in 1925 renamed Nehi Corporation after its colored and flavored drinks. In 1934, Chero-Cola was reformulated by Rufus Kamm, a chemist, and re-released as Royal Crown Cola.\n\nIn the 1950s, Royal Crown Cola and moon pies were a popular \"working man's lunch\" in the American South. In 1954, Royal Crown was the first company to sell soft drinks in a can, and later the first company to sell a soft drink in an aluminum can.\n\nIn 1958, the company introduced the first diet cola, Diet Rite, and in 1980, a caffeine-free cola, RC 100. In the mid-1990s, RC released Royal Crown Draft Cola, billed as a \"premium\" cola using pure cane sugar as a sweetener, rather than high fructose corn syrup. Offered only in 12-ounce bottles, sales were disappointing, due largely to the inability of the RC bottling network to get distribution for the product in single-drink channels, and it was discontinued with the exceptions of Australia, New Zealand and France. It was later available only in New Zealand, parts of Australia, Thailand, and Tajikistan. The company also released Cherry RC, a cherry-flavored version of the RC soft drink, to compete with Cherry Coke and Pepsi Wild Cherry.\n\nIn 1984, RC Cola accounted for approximately 4-5% of soft drink sales in the United States, behind only Coke, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, and Seven Up.\n\nIn October 2000, Royal Crown was acquired by Cadbury (then Cadbury Schweppes) through its acquisition of Snapple. Royal Crown operations were subsequently folded into Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPSG), which was spun off from Cadbury in 2008. DPSG merged with Keurig Green Mountain in 2018 as Keurig Dr Pepper, the current owners of the RC Cola brand.\n\nIn 2001, all non-US RC-branded businesses were sold to Cott Beverages of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, and are operated as Royal Crown Cola International, which handles RC Cola products outside the United States.\n\nThe RC Cola brand has been marketed through many campaigns. In the 1930s, Alex Osborn, with BBDO, made an ad campaign, including the following slogan: \"The season's best.\"\n\nThe 1940s saw a magazine advertising campaign with actress Lizabeth Scott as the face, next to the slogan \"RC tastes best, says Lizabeth Scott\".\n\nIn 1966, Royal Crown Cola collaborated with Jim Henson on an ad campaign for Royal Crown Cola which featured two birds called Sour Bird (performed by Jim Henson) and Nutty Bird (performed by Henson and assisted by Frank Oz) to promote the drinks. Nutty Bird would promote Royal Crown Cola by touting the benefits. The puppet for Nutty Bird was designed by Jim Henson and built by Don Sahlin. Sour Bird appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" with the Rock and Roll Monster.\n\nNancy Sinatra was featured in two Royal Crown Cola commercials in her one-hour TV special, \"Movin' With Nancy\", which featured various singers and David Winters choreography in December 1967. She sang, \"It's a mad, mad, mad Cola... RC the one with the mad, mad taste!...RC!\" The company was the official sponsor of New York Mets on and off at times from the team's inception in 1962 until the early 1990s. A television commercial in the New York area featured Tom Seaver, New York Mets pitcher, and his wife, Nancy, dancing on top of a dugout at Shea Stadium and singing the tune from the Sinatra campaign. RC sponsored two Porsche 917/10 Can-Am race cars during the 1972-73 season. In the mid 1970s, Royal Crown ran the \"Me & My RC\" advertisements. Others featured people in scenic outdoor locations. The jingle, sung by Louise Mandrell, went, \"Me and my RC / Me and my RC /'Cause what's good enough / For other folks / Ain't good enough for me.\" RC was introduced to Israel in 1995 with the slogan \"RC: Just like in America!\" During the Cola Wars of the 1980s, RC used the 'Decide for yourself' campaign and would remind people 'There's more to your life than Coke and Pepsi.\" The Philippines released advertisements using rising stars.They also painted their \"suki\" stores with slogans like \"RC ng (insert municipality/city)\".\n\nAndretti Autosport driver Marco Andretti had RC Cola as primary sponsor during the 2012 and 2013 IndyCar Series.\n\n"}

{"id": "57068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57068", "title": "Copra", "text": "Copra\n\nCopra(or khobara) is the dried meat or kernel of the coconut, which is the fruit of the coconut palm (\"Cocos nucifera\"). Coconut oil is extracted from copra, making it an important agricultural commodity for many coconut-producing countries. It also yields de-fatted coconut cake after oil extraction, which is mainly used as feed for livestock.\n\nCopra has traditionally been grated and ground then boiled in water to extract coconut oil. It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the South Seas and South Asia in the 1860s. This 19th-century copra trading inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's 1893 novella \"The Beach of Falesá\", based on his experiences in Samoa. Nowadays, the process of coconut oil extraction is performed by crushing copra to produce coconut oil (70%); the by-product is known as copra cake or copra meal (30%).\n\nOnce the oil is extracted, the remaining coconut cake is 18–25% protein but contains so much dietary fiber it cannot be eaten in large quantities by humans. Instead, it is normally fed to ruminants.\n\nThe production of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun.\n\nIn India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.\n\nWhile there are some large plantations with integrated operations, copra remains primarily a smallholder crop. The major producing country is the Philippines. It is also a major exporter. In former years copra was collected by traders going from island to island and port to port in the Pacific Ocean but South Pacific production is now much diminished, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nCopra production begins on coconut plantations. Coconut trees are generally spaced apart, allowing a density of 100–160 coconut trees per hectare. A standard tree bears around 50–80 nuts a year, and average earnings in Vanuatu (1999) were US$0.20 per kg (one kg equals 8 nuts)—so a farmer could earn approximately US$120 to US$320 yearly for each planted hectare. Copra has since more than doubled in price, and was last quoted at US$540 per ton in the Philippines on a CIF Rotterdam basis (US$0.54 per kg) by the \"Financial Times\" on 9 November 2012.\n\nThe largest source of copra is from the Philippines, where the value of annual production exceeds US$80 million. A very large number of small farmers and tree owners produce copra, which is a vital part of their income. Unfortunately, copra is highly susceptible to the growth of aflatoxins if not dried properly. Aflatoxins can be highly toxic, and are among the most potent known natural carcinogens, particularly affecting the liver. Aflatoxins in copra cake, fed to animals, can be passed on in milk or meat, leading to human illnesses.\n\nIn the Philippines, copra is collected as dried \"cups\" (the meat from one-half of a coconut), which are shipped in large burlap (hessian) bags. At the shipping point (typically, a dock) the copra is sampled by driving a small metal tube into the bag at several points, thus perforating the cups and collecting small amounts of copra within the tubes. Those samples are measured for aflatoxin contamination. If within standards the bag is shipped. This method leaves the risk that many cups are missed by the random sampling—and seriously contaminated copra might be missed. Because so many small producers are involved, it is impractical to monitor all the farms and drying sites (which is where aflatoxin contamination occurs). The Philippines government continues to work on developing methods for the testing, safety, and minimisation of aflatoxins.\n\nCopra meal is used as fodder for horses and cattle. Its high oil and protein levels are fattening for stock. The protein in copra meal has been heat treated and provides a source of high-quality protein for cattle, sheep and deer, because it does not break down in the rumen.\n\nCoconut oil can be extracted using either mechanical expellers or solvents (hexane). Mechanically expelled copra meal is of higher feeding value, because it contains typically 8–12% oil, whereas the solvent-extracted copra meal contains only 2–4% oil. Premium quality copra meal can also contain 20–22% crude protein, and <20ppb aflatoxin.\n\nHigh-quality copra meal contains <12% non structural carbohydrate (NSC), which makes it well suited for feeding to horses that are prone to ulcers, insulin resistance, colic, tying up, and acidosis.\n\nCopra has been classed with dangerous goods due to its spontaneously combustive nature. It is identified as a Division 4.2 substance. It has been forbidden by ICAO from flight without the express written permission of a state authorised agency.\n\n"}
{"id": "57260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57260", "title": "Envelope", "text": "Envelope\n\nAn envelope is a common packaging item, usually made of thin, flat material. It is designed to contain a flat object, such as a letter or card.\n\nTraditional envelopes are made from sheets of paper cut to one of three shapes: a rhombus, a short-arm cross or a kite. These shapes allow for the creation of the envelope structure by folding the sheet sides around a central rectangular area. In this manner, a rectangle-faced enclosure is formed with an arrangement of four flaps on the reverse side.\n\nWhen the folding sequence is such that the last flap to be closed is on a short side it is referred to in commercial envelope manufacture as a pocket - a format frequently employed in the packaging of small quantities of seeds. Although in principle the flaps can be held in place by securing the topmost flap at a single point (for example with a wax seal), generally they are pasted or gummed together at the overlaps. They are most commonly used for enclosing and sending mail (letters) through a prepaid-postage postal system.\n\nWindow envelopes have a hole cut in the front side that allows the paper within to be seen. They are generally arranged so that the receiving address printed on the letter is visible, saving the sender from having to duplicate the address on the envelope itself. The window is normally covered with a transparent or translucent film to protect the letter inside, as was first designed by Americus F. Callahan in 1901 and patented the following year. In some cases, shortages of materials or the need to economize resulted in envelopes that had no film covering the window. One innovative process, invented in Europe about 1905, involved using hot oil to saturate the area of the envelope where the address would appear. The treated area became sufficiently translucent for the address to be readable. there is no international standard for window envelopes, but some countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have national standards.\n\nAn aerogram is related to a lettersheet, both being designed to have writing on the inside to minimize the weight. Any handmade envelope is effectively a lettersheet because prior to the folding stage it offers the opportunity for writing a message on that area of the sheet that after folding becomes the inside of the face of the envelope.\n\nThe \"envelope\" used to launch the Penny Post component of the British postal reforms of 1840 by Sir Rowland Hill and the invention of the postage stamp, was a lozenge-shaped lettersheet known as a Mulready. If desired, a separate letter could be enclosed with postage remaining at one penny provided the combined weight did not exceed half an ounce (14 grams). This was a legacy of the previous system of calculating postage, which partly depended on the number of sheets of paper used.\n\nDuring the U.S. Civil War those in the Confederate States Army occasionally used envelopes made from wallpaper, due to financial hardship.\n\nA \"return envelope\" is a pre-addressed, smaller envelope included as the contents of a larger envelope and can be used for courtesy reply mail, metered reply mail, or freepost (business reply mail). Some envelopes are designed to be reused as the return envelope, saving the expense of including a return envelope in the contents of the original envelope. The direct mail industry makes extensive use of return envelopes as a response mechanism.\n\nUp until 1840, all envelopes were handmade, each being individually cut to the appropriate shape out of an individual rectangular sheet. In that year George Wilson in the United Kingdom patented the method of tessellating (tiling) a number of envelope patterns across and down a large sheet, thereby reducing the overall amount of waste produced per envelope when they were cut out. In 1845 Edwin Hill and Warren de la Rue obtained a patent for a steam-driven machine that not only cut out the envelope shapes but creased and folded them as well. (Mechanised gumming had yet to be devised.) The convenience of the sheets ready cut to shape popularized the use of machine-made envelopes, and the economic significance of the factories that had produced handmade envelopes gradually diminished.\n\nAs envelopes are made of paper, they are intrinsically amenable to embellishment with additional graphics and text over and above the necessary postal markings. This is a feature that the direct mail industry has long taken advantage of—and more recently the Mail Art movement. Custom printed envelopes has also become an increasingly popular marketing method for small business.\n\nMost of the over 400 billion envelopes of all sizes made worldwide are machine-made.\n\nInternational standard ISO 269 defined (It has since become a withdrawn standard.) several standard envelope sizes, which are designed for use with ISO 216 standard paper sizes:\nThe German standard DIN 678 defines a similar list of envelope formats.\n\nThere are dozens of sizes of envelopes available.\n\nThe designations such as \"A2\" do not correspond to ISO paper sizes. (Often, North American paper jobbers and printers will insert a hyphen to distinguish from ISO sizes, thus: A-2.)\n\nThe No. 10 envelope is the standard business envelope size in the United States.\n\nEnvelopes accepted by the U.S. Postal Service for mailing at the price of a letter must be:\n\n\nCheck out Central Mailing Services infographic here for the general sizes of envelopes in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first known envelope was nothing like the paper envelope of today. It can be dated back to around 3500 to 3200 BC in the ancient Middle East. Hollow, clay spheres were molded around financial tokens and used in private transactions. The two people who discovered these first envelopes were Jacques de Morgan, in 1901, and Roland de Mecquenem, in 1907.\n\nPaper envelopes were developed in China, where paper was invented by 2nd century BC. Paper envelopes, known as \"chih poh\", were used to store gifts of money. In the Southern Song dynasty, the Chinese imperial court used paper envelopes to distribute monetary gifts to government officials.\n\nPrior to 1845, hand-made envelopes were all that were available for use, both commercial and domestic. In 1845, Edwin Hill and Warren De La Rue were granted a British patent for the first envelope-making machine.\n\nThe \"envelopes\" produced by the Hill/De La Rue machine were not like those used today. They were flat diamond, lozenge (or rhombus)-shaped sheets or \"blanks\" that had been precut to shape before being fed to the machine for creasing and made ready for folding to form a rectangular enclosure. The edges of the overlapping flaps treated with a paste or adhesive and the method of securing the envelope or wrapper was a user choice. The symmetrical flap arrangement meant that it could be held together with a single wax seal at the apex of the topmost flap. (That the flaps of an envelope can be held together by applying a seal at a single point is a classic design feature of an envelope.)\n\nNearly 50 years passed before a commercially successful machine for producing pre-gummed envelopes, like those in use today, appeared.\n\nThe origin of the use of the diamond shape for envelopes is debated. However, as an alternative to simply wrapping a sheet of paper around a folded letter or an invitation and sealing the edges, it is a tidy and ostensibly paper-efficient way of producing a rectangular-faced envelope. Where the claim to be paper-efficient fails is a consequence of paper manufacturers normally making paper available in rectangular sheets, because the largest size of envelope that can be realised by cutting out a diamond or any other shape which yields an envelope with symmetrical flaps is smaller than the largest that can be made from that sheet simply by folding.\nThe folded diamond-shaped sheet (or \"blank\") was in use at the beginning of the 19th century as a novelty wrapper for invitations and letters among the proportion of the population that had the time to sit and cut them out and were affluent enough not to bother about the waste offcuts. Their use first became widespread in the UK when the British government took monopoly control of postal services and tasked Rowland Hill with its introduction. The new service was launched in May 1840 with a postage-paid machine-printed illustrated (or pictorial) version of the wrapper and the much-celebrated first adhesive postage stamp, the Penny Black, for the production of which the Jacob Perkins printing process was used to deter counterfeiting and forgery. The wrappers were printed and sold as a sheet of 12, with cutting the purchaser's task. Known as Mulready stationery, because the illustration was created by the respected artist William Mulready, the envelopes were withdrawn when the illustration was ridiculed and lampooned. Nevertheless, the public apparently saw the convenience of the wrappers being available ready-shaped, and it must have been obvious that with the stamp available totally plain versions of the wrapper could be produced and postage prepaid by purchasing a stamp and affixing it to the wrapper once folded and secured. In this way although the postage-prepaid printed pictorial version died ignominiously, the diamond-shaped wrapper acquired de facto official status and became readily available to the public notwithstanding the time taken to cut them out and the waste generated. With the issuing of the stamps and the operation and control of the service (which is a communications medium) in government hands the British model spread around the world and the diamond-shaped wrapper went with it.\n\nHill also installed his brother Edwin as The Controller of Stamps, and it was he with his partner Warren De La Rue who patented the machine for mass-producing the diamond-shaped sheets for conversion to envelopes in 1845. Today, envelope-making machine manufacture is a long- and well-established international industry, and blanks are produced with a short-arm-cross shape and a kite shape as well as diamond shape. (The short-arm-cross style is mostly encountered in \"pocket\" envelopes i.e. envelopes with the closing flap on a short side. The more common style, with the closing flap on a long side, are sometimes referred to as \"standard\" or \"wallet\" style for purposes of differentiation.)\n\nThe most famous paper-making machine was the Fourdrinier machine. The process involves taking processed pulp stock and converting it to a continuous web which is gathered as a reel. Subsequently, the reel is guillotined edge to edge to create a large number of properly rectangular sheets because ever since the invention of Gutenberg's press paper has been closely associated with printing.\n\nTo this day, all other mechanical printing and duplicating equipments devised in the meantime, including the typewriter (which was used up to the 1990s for addressing envelopes), have been primarily designed to process rectangular sheets. Hence the large sheets are in turn are guillotined down to the sizes of rectangular sheet commonly used in the commercial printing industry, and nowadays to the sizes commonly used as feed-stock in office-grade computer printers, copiers and duplicators (mainly ISO, A4 and US Letter).\n\nUsing any mechanical printing equipment to print on envelopes, which although rectangular, are in fact folded sheets with differing thicknesses across their surfaces, calls for skill and attention on the part of the operator. In commercial printing the task of printing on machine-made envelopes is referred to as \"overprinting\" and is usually confined to the front of the envelope. If printing is required on all four flaps as well as the front, the process is referred to as \"printing on the flat\". Eye-catching illustrated envelopes or pictorial envelopes, the origins of which as an artistic genre can be attributed to the Mulready stationery – and which was printed in this way - are used extensively for direct mail. In this respect, direct mail envelopes have a shared history with propaganda envelopes (or \"covers\") as they are called by philatelists.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, in 1998, the digital printing revolution delivered another benefit for small businesses when the U.S. Postal Service became the first postal authority to approve the introduction of a system of applying to an envelope in the printer bin of a PC sheet printer a digital frank or stamp delivered via the Internet. With this innovative alternative to an adhesive-backed postage stamp as the basis for an Electronic Stamp Distribution (ESD) service, a business envelope could be produced in-house, addressed and customized with advertising information on the face, and ready to be mailed.\n\nThe fortunes of the commercial envelope manufacturing industry and the postal service go hand in hand, and both link to the printing industry and the mechanized envelope processing industry producing equipment such as franking and addressing machines. They are all four symbiotic: technological developments affecting one obviously ricochet through the others: addressing machines print addresses, postage stamps are a print product, franking machines imprint a frank on an envelope. If fewer envelopes are required; fewer stamps are required; fewer franking machines are required and fewer addressing machines are required. For example, the advent and adoption of information-based indicia (IBI) (commonly referred to as digitally-encoded electronic stamps or digital indicia) by the US Postal Service in 1998 caused widespread consternation in the franking machine industry, as their equipments were effectively rendered obsolescent and resulted in a flurry of lawsuits involving Pitney Bowes among others. The advent of e-mail in the late 1990s appeared to offer a substantial threat to the postal service. By 2008 letter-post service operators were reporting significantly smaller volumes of letter-post, specifically stamped envelopes, which they attributed mainly to replacement by e-mail. Although a corresponding reduction in the volume of envelopes required would have been expected, no such decrease was reported as widely as the reduction in letter-post volumes.\n\nAlthough, with regards to e-mail developments, there is a substantial threat of \"technology replacing tradition\". This is offset by the equal reasoning that the Universal Postal Union is an international specialised agency of the United Nations, and a source of revenue for the government. Consequently, any deterioration of domestic and international postal services attended by loss of revenue is a matter of governmental concern.\n\nA windowed envelope is an envelope with a plastic or glassine window in it. The plastic in these envelopes creates problems in paper recycling. Consumers who do not want to go through the trouble of ripping out the plastic window should put the envelope in a trash bag after use.\n\nSecurity envelopes have special tamper-resistant and tamper-evident features. They are used for high value products and documents as well as for evidence for legal proceedings.\n\nSome security envelopes have a patterned tint printed on the inside, which makes it difficult to read the contents. Various patterns exist.\n\nSome envelopes are available for full size documents. Some carriers have large mailing envelopes for their express services. Other similar envelopes are available at stationery supply locations.\n\nThese mailers usually have an opening on an end with a flap that can be attached by gummed adhesive, integral pressure-sensitive adhesive, adhesive tape, or security tape.\nConstruction is usually:\n\nShipping envelopes can have padding to provide stiffness and some degree of cushioning. The padding can be ground newsprint, plastic foam sheets, or bubble packing.\n\nVarious U.S. Federal Government offices use Standard Form (SF) 65 Government Messenger Envelopes for inter-office mail delivery. These envelopes are typically light brown in color and un-sealed with string-tied closure method and an array of holes throughout both sides such that it is somewhat visible what the envelope contains. Other colloquial names for this envelope include \"Holey Joe\" and \"Shotgun\" envelope due to the holey nature of the envelope. Address method is unique in that these envelopes are re-usable and the previous address is crossed out thoroughly and the new addressee (name, building, room, and mailstop) is written in the next available box. Although still in use, SF-65 is no longer listed on the United States Office of Personnel Management website list of standard forms, which may indicate new envelopes are no longer being printed. \n\n"}
{"id": "57572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57572", "title": "Cake", "text": "Cake\n\nCake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.\n\nTypical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.\n\nCake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.\n\nThe term \"cake\" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word \"kaka\".\n\nThe ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (\"plakous\"), which was derived from the word for \"flat\", πλακόεις (\"plakoeis\"). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts and honey. They also had a cake called \"satura\", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became \"placenta\" which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.\n\nThe Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk. In ancient Rome, basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good. Latin poet Ovid refers his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first book of exile, \"Tristia\".\n\nEarly cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a \"cake\" and \"bread\" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.\n\nSponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States. One company patented a cake-bread mix in order to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake as it is known today became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.\n\nLater, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor force, were confined to the domestic sphere, while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US. This inspired psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem in frosting. Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.\n\nEver since, cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets, and is complemented with frosting in a can.\n\nCakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. \n\nAlthough clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive. For example, banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake.\n\nSome varieties of cake are widely available in the form of cake mixes, wherein some of the ingredients (usually flour, sugar, flavoring, baking powder, and sometimes some form of fat) are premixed, and the cook needs add only a few extra ingredients, usually eggs, water, and sometimes vegetable oil or butter. While the diversity of represented styles is limited, cake mixes do provide an easy and readily available homemade option for cooks who are not accomplished bakers.\n\nCakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of \"confarreatio\" originated in the sharing of a cake.\n\nParticular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.\n\nA Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. The cake has been described as \"somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be's baking skills\". Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped cream.\n\nCakes are frequently described according to their physical form. Cakes may be small and intended for individual consumption. Larger cakes may be made with the intention of being sliced and served as part of a meal or social function. Common shapes include:\n\nSpecial cake flour with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is strongly bleached, and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour. Some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour, notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.\n\nA cake can fall, whereby parts of it sink or flatten, when baked at a temperature that is too low or too hot, when it has been underbaked and when placed in an oven that is too hot at the beginning of the baking process. The use of excessive amounts of sugar, flour, fat or leavening can also cause a cake to fall. A cake can also fall when subjected to cool air that enters an oven when the oven door is opened during the cooking process.\n\nA finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, which are also known as \"jimmies\" in certain parts of the United States and \"hundreds and thousands\" in the United Kingdom. Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder. Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing. Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, butter, margarine, or some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.\n\nSpecial tools are needed for more complex cake decorating, such as piping bags and various piping tips, syringes and embossing mats. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips. An embossing mat is used to create embossed effects. A cake turntable that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration.\n\nRoyal icing, marzipan (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing\n(also known as sugarpaste), and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations. Floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally Madeira cakes, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets.\n\n"}
{"id": "57986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57986", "title": "Gladius", "text": "Gladius\n\nGladius (; ) was one Latin word for \"sword\", and is used to represent the primary sword of Ancient Roman foot soldiers. Early ancient Roman swords were similar to those of the Greeks, called xiphos. From the 3rd century BC, however, the Romans adopted swords similar to those used by the Celtiberians and others during the early part of the conquest of Hispania. This sword was known as the \"gladius hispaniensis\", or \"Hispanic sword\".\n\nA fully equipped Roman legionary after the reforms of Gaius Marius was armed with a shield (\"scutum\"), one or two javelins (\"pila\"), a sword (\"gladius\"), often a dagger (\"pugio\"), and, perhaps in the later empire period, darts (\"plumbatae\"). Conventionally, soldiers threw \"pilae\" to disable the enemy's shields and disrupt enemy formations before engaging in close combat, for which they drew the \"gladius\". A soldier generally led with the shield and thrust with the sword.\n\n\"Gladius\" is a Latin masculine second declension noun. Its (nominative and vocative) plural is \"gladiī\". However, \"gladius\" in Latin refers to any sword, not specifically the modern definition of a \"gladius\". The word appears in literature as early as the plays of Plautus (\"Casina\", \"Rudens\").\n\n\"Gladius\" is generally believed to be a Celtic loan in Latin (perhaps via an Etruscan intermediary), derived from ancient Celtic \"*kladi(b)os\" or \"*kladimos\" \"sword\" (whence modern Welsh \"cleddyf\" \"sword\", modern Breton \"klezeff\", Old Irish \"claideb\"/Modern Irish \"claidheamh\" [itself perhaps a loan from Welsh]; the root of the word may survive in the Old Irish verb \"claidid\" \"digs, excavates\" and anciently attested in the Gallo-Brittonic place name element \"cladia\"/\"clado\" \"ditch, trench, valley hollow\").\n\nModern English words derived from \"gladius\" include gladiator (\"swordsman\") and \"gladiolus\" (\"little sword\", from the diminutive form of \"gladius\"), a flowering plant with sword-shaped leaves.\n\nAccording to Livy and Polybius, Celtiberian mercenaries for Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae wielded short swords that excelled at both slashing and thrusting. Roman military would have adopted this design even before the end of the war, calling it \"gladius hispaniensis\" in Latin and \"iberiké machaira\" in Greek. This weapon replaced the previous Roman sword, which would have been based on the Greek \"xiphos\".\n\nLater, Livy relates the story of Titus Manlius Torquatus accepting a challenge to a single combat by a large Gallic soldier at a bridge over the Anio river, where the Gauls and the Romans were encamped on opposite sides. Manlius strapped on the \"Hispanic sword\" (\"gladius Hispanus\"). During the combat he thrust twice with it under the shield of the Gaul, dealing fatal blows to the abdomen. He then removed the Gaul's torc and placed it around his own neck, hence the name, \"torquatus\".\n\nThe combat occurred during the consulships of C. Sulpicius Peticus and C. Licinius Stolo—i.e., about 361 BC, long before the Punic Wars, but during the frontier wars with the Gauls (366-341 BC). One theory proposes the borrowing of the word \"gladius\" from *\"kladi\"- during this period, relying on the principle that \"K\" often became \"G\" in Latin. Ennius attests the word. \"gladius\" may have replaced \"ensis\", which in the literary periods was used mainly by poets.\n\nThe exact origin of the \"gladius Hispanus\" is disputed. While it is likely that it descended ultimately from Celtic swords of the La Tene and Hallstat periods, no one knows if it came to the Romans through Celtiberian troops of the Punic Wars, or through Gallic troops of the Gallic Wars.\n\nArguments for the Celtiberian source of the weapon have been reinforced in recent decades by discovery of early Roman \"gladii\" that seem to highlight that they were copies of Celtiberian models. The weapon developed in Iberia after La Tène I models, which were adapted to traditional Celtiberian techniques during the late 4th and early 3rd centuries BC. These weapons are quite original in their design, so that they cannot be confused with Gallic types.\n\nBy the time of the Roman Republic, which flourished during the Iron Age, the classical world was well-acquainted with steel and the steel-making process. Pure iron is relatively soft, but pure iron is never found in nature. Natural iron ore contains various impurities in solid solution, which harden the reduced metal by producing irregular-shaped metallic crystals. The \"gladius\" was generally made out of steel.\n\nIn Roman times, workers reduced ore in a bloomery furnace. The resulting pieces were called \"blooms\", which they further worked to remove slag inclusions from the porous surface.\n\nA recent metallurgical study of two Etrurian swords, one in the form of a Greek \"kopis\" from 7th century BC Vetulonia, the other in the form of a \"gladius Hispaniensis\" from 4th century BC Chiusa, gives insight concerning the manufacture of Roman swords. The Chiusa sword comes from Romanized \"etruria\"; thus, regardless of the names of the forms (which the authors do not identify), the authors believe the process was continuous from the Etruscans to the Romans.\n\nThe Vetulonian sword was crafted by the pattern welding process from five blooms reduced at a temperature of 1163 °C. Five strips of varying carbon content were created. A central core of the sword contained the highest: 0.15–0.25% carbon. On its edges were placed four strips of low-carbon steel, 0.05–0.07%, and the whole thing was welded together by forging on the pattern of hammer blows. A blow increased the temperature sufficiently to produce a friction weld at that spot. Forging continued until the steel was cold, producing some central annealing. The sword was long.\n\nThe Chiusian sword was created from a single bloom by forging from a temperature of 1237 °C. The carbon content increased from 0.05–0.08% at the back side of the sword to 0.35–0.4% on the blade, from which the authors deduce that some form of carburization may have been used. The sword was long and was characterized by a wasp-waist close to the hilt.\n\nRomans continued to forge swords, both as composites and from single pieces. Inclusions of sand and rust weakened the two swords in the study, and no doubt limited the strength of swords during the Roman period.\n\nThe word \"gladius\" acquired a general meaning as any type of sword. This use appears as early as the 1st century AD in the \"Biography of Alexander the Great\" by Quintus Curtius Rufus. The republican authors, however, appear to mean a specific type of sword, which is now known from archaeology to have had variants.\n\n\"Gladii\" were two-edged for cutting and had a tapered point for stabbing during thrusting. A solid grip was provided by a knobbed hilt added on, possibly with ridges for the fingers. Blade strength was achieved by welding together strips, in which case the sword had a channel down the center, or by fashioning a single piece of high-carbon steel, rhomboidal in cross-section. The owner's name was often engraved or punched on the blade.\n\nThe hilt of a Roman sword was the \"capulus\". It was often ornate, especially the sword-hilts of officers and dignitaries.\n\nStabbing was a very efficient technique, as stabbing wounds, especially in the abdominal area, were almost always deadly. However, the \"gladius\" in some circumstances was used for cutting or slashing, as is indicated by Livy's account of the Macedonian Wars, wherein the Macedonian soldiers were horrified to see dismembered bodies.\n\nThough the primary infantry attack was thrusting at stomach height, they were trained to take any advantage, such as slashing at kneecaps beneath the shield wall.\n\nThe \"gladius\" was sheathed in a scabbard mounted on a belt or shoulder strap, some say on the right, some say on the left. Some say the soldier reached across his body to draw it, and others claim that the position of the shield made this method of drawing impossible. A centurion wore it on the opposite side as a mark of distinction.\n\nTowards the end of the 2nd century AD and during the 3rd century the \"spatha\" gradually took the place of the \"gladius\" in the Roman legions.\n\nSeveral different designs were used; among collectors and historical reenactors, the three primary kinds are known as the \"Mainz gladius\", the \"Fulham gladius\", and the \"Pompeii gladius\" (these names refer to where or how the canonical example was found). More recent archaeological finds have uncovered an earlier version, the \"gladius Hispaniensis\".\n\nThe differences between these varieties are subtle. The original Hispanic sword, which was used during the republic, had a slight \"wasp-waist\" or \"leaf-blade\" curvature. The Mainz variety came into use on the frontier in the early empire. It kept the curvature, but shortened and widened the blade and made the point triangular. At home, the less battle-effective Pompeii version came into use. It eliminated the curvature, lengthened the blade, and diminished the point. The Fulham was a compromise, with straight edges and a long point.\n\nDescriptions of the main types follow:\n\nThe Mainz and the Pompeii are the two main classification types and served side by side for many years and it was not uncommon to find 4th century legionaries carrying the earlier model.\n\n\nPlease note that this is only true for the nominative case; For more information, see the Latin declension page.\n\n\nThe articles in the links below often differ both in theory and in detail. They should not necessarily be understood as fully professional articles but should be appreciated for their presentational value.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58593", "title": "El (deity)", "text": "El (deity)\n\nSpecific deities known as \"ʾEl\" or \"ʾIl\" include the supreme god of the ancient Canaanite religion and the supreme god of East Semitic speakers in Mesopotamia’s Early Dynastic Period.\n\nCognate forms are found throughout the Semitic languages. They include Ugaritic , pl. ; Phoenician pl. ; Hebrew , pl. ; Aramaic ; Akkadian , pl. .\n\nIn northwest Semitic use, \"El\" was both a generic word for any god and the special name or title of a particular god who was distinguished from other gods as being \"the god\". El is listed at the head of many pantheons. In some Canaanite and Ugaritic sources, El played a role as father of the gods or of creation.\n\nHowever, because the word sometimes refers to a god other than the great god Ēl, it is frequently ambiguous as to whether Ēl followed by another name means the great god Ēl with a particular epithet applied or refers to another god entirely. For example, in the Ugaritic texts, \"ʾil mlk\" is understood to mean \"Ēl the King\" but \"ʾil hd\" as \"the god Hadad\".\n\nThe Semitic root \"ʾlh\" (Arabic \"\", Aramaic \"ʾAlāh\", \"ʾElāh\", Hebrew \"ʾelōah\") may be \"ʾl\" with a parasitic h, and \"ʾl\" may be an abbreviated form of \"ʾlh\". In Ugaritic the plural form meaning \"gods\" is , equivalent to Hebrew \"powers\". In the Hebrew texts this word is interpreted as being semantically singular for \"god\" by biblical commentators. However the documentary hypothesis developed originally in the 1870s, identifies these that different authors - Jahwist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, and the Priestly source - were responsible for editing stories from a polytheistic religion into those of a monotheistic religion. Inconsistencies that arise between monotheism and polytheism in the texts are reflective of this hypothesis.\n\nThe stem \"ʾl\" is found prominently in the earliest strata of east Semitic, northwest Semitic, and south Semitic groups. Personal names including the stem \"ʾl\" are found with similar patterns in both Amorite and Sabaic—which indicates that probably already in Proto-Semitic \"ʾl\" was both a generic term for \"god\" and the common name or title of a single particular god.\n\nThe Egyptian god Ptah is given the title \"ḏū gitti\" 'Lord of Gath' in a prism from Tel Lachish which has on its opposite face the name of Amenhotep II (c. 1435–1420 BCE). The title \"ḏū gitti\" is also found in Serābitṭ text 353. Cross (1973, p. 19) points out that Ptah is often called \"the Lord (or one) of eternity\" and thinks it may be this identification of ʼĒl with Ptah that lead to the epithet \"’olam\" 'eternal' being applied to ʼĒl so early and so consistently. (However, in the Ugaritic texts, Ptah is seemingly identified rather with the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis.)\n\nA Phoenician inscribed amulet of the seventh century BCE from Arslan Tash may refer to ʼĒl. The text was translated by Rosenthal (1969, p. 658) as follows:\n\nHowever, Cross (1973, p. 17) translated the text as follows:\n\nIn some inscriptions, the name \"’Ēl qōne ’arṣ\" meaning \"ʼĒl creator of Earth\" appears, even including a late inscription at Leptis Magna in Tripolitania dating to the second century. In Hittite texts, the expression becomes the single name \"Ilkunirsa\", this Ilkunirsa appearing as the husband of Asherdu (Asherah) and father of 77 or 88 sons.\n\nIn a Hurrian hymn to ʼĒl (published in \"Ugaritica V\", text RS 24.278), he is called \"’il brt\" and \"’il dn\", which Cross (p. 39) takes as 'ʼĒl of the covenant' and 'ʼĒl the judge' respectively.\n\nAmorite inscriptions from Sam'al refer to numerous gods, sometimes by name, sometimes by title, especially by such titles as \"Ilabrat\" 'God of the people'(?), \"ʾil abīka\" \"God of your father\", \"ʾil abīni\" \"God of our father\" and so forth. Various family gods are recorded, divine names listed as belonging to a particular family or clan, sometimes by title and sometimes by name, including the name \"ʾil\" \"God\". In Amorite personal names, the most common divine elements are \"ʾil\" \"God\", \"Hadad\"/\"Adad\", and \"Dagan\". It is likely that \"ʾil\" is also very often the god called in Akkadian texts \"Amurru\" or \"ʾil ʾamurru\".\n\nFor the Canaanites and the ancient Levantine region as a whole, Ēl or Il was the supreme god, the father of mankind and all creatures. He also fathered many gods, most importantly Hadad, Yam, and Mot, each sharing similar attributes to the Greco-Roman gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades respectively.\n\nAs recorded on the clay tablets of Ugarit, El is the husband of the goddess Asherah.\n\nThree pantheon lists found at Ugarit (modern —, Syria) begin with the four gods \"’il-’ib\" (which according to Cross; is the name of a generic kind of deity, perhaps the divine ancestor of the people), Ēl, Dagnu (that is Dagon), and Ba’l Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or Hadad). Though Ugarit had a large temple dedicated to Dagon and another to Hadad, there was no temple dedicated to Ēl.\n\nĒl is called again and again \"Tôru ‘Ēl\" (\"Bull Ēl\" or \"the bull god\"). He is \"bātnyu binwāti\" (\"Creator of creatures\"), \"’abū banī ’ili\" (\"father of the gods\"), and \"‘abū ‘adami\" (\"father of man\"). He is \"qāniyunu ‘ôlam\" (\"creator eternal\"), the epithet \"‘ôlam\" appearing in Hebrew form in the Hebrew name of God \"’ēl ‘ôlam\" \"God Eternal\" in Genesis 21.33. He is \"ḥātikuka\" (\"your patriarch\"). Ēl is the grey-bearded ancient one, full of wisdom, \"malku\" (\"King\"), \"’abū šamīma\" (\"Father of years\"), \"’El gibbōr\" (\"Ēl the warrior\"). He is also named \"lṭpn\" of unknown meaning, variously rendered as Latpan, Latipan, or Lutpani (\"shroud-face\" by \"Strong's Hebrew Concordance\").\n\n\"El\" (Father of Heaven / Saturn) and his major son: \"Hadad\" (Father of Earth / Jupiter), are symbolized both by the bull, and both wear bull horns on their headdresses.\n\nIn Canaanite mythology, El builds a desert sanctuary with his children and his two wives, leading to speculation that at one point El was a desert god.\n\nThe mysterious Ugaritic text \"Shachar and Shalim\" tells how (perhaps near the beginning of all things) Ēl came to shores of the sea and saw two women who bobbed up and down. Ēl was sexually aroused and took the two with him, killed a bird by throwing a staff at it, and roasted it over a fire. He asked the women to tell him when the bird was fully cooked, and to then address him either as husband or as father, for he would thenceforward behave to them as they called him. They saluted him as husband. He then lay with them, and they gave birth to \"Shachar\" (\"Dawn\") and \"Shalim\" (\"Dusk\"). Again Ēl lay with his wives and the wives gave birth to \"the gracious gods\", \"cleavers of the sea\", \"children of the sea\". The names of these wives are not explicitly provided, but some confusing rubrics at the beginning of the account mention the goddess Athirat, who is otherwise Ēl's chief wife, and the goddess Raḥmayyu (\"the one of the womb\"), otherwise unknown.\n\nIn the Ugaritic Ba‘al cycle, Ēl is introduced dwelling on (or in) Mount Lel (\"Lel\" possibly meaning \"Night\") at the fountains of the two rivers at the spring of the two deeps. He dwells in a tent according to some interpretations of the text which may explain why he had no temple in Ugarit. As to the rivers and the spring of the two deeps, these might refer to real streams, or to the mythological sources of the salt water ocean and the fresh water sources under the earth, or to the waters above the heavens and the waters beneath the earth.\n\nIn the episode of the \"Palace of Ba‘al\", the god Ba‘al Hadad invites the \"seventy sons of Athirat\" to a feast in his new palace. Presumably these sons have been fathered on Athirat by Ēl; in following passages they seem be the gods (\"’ilm\") in general or at least a large portion of them. The only sons of Ēl named individually in the Ugaritic texts are Yamm (\"Sea\"), Mot (\"Death\"), and Ashtar, who may be the chief and leader of most of the sons of Ēl. Ba‘al Hadad is a few times called Ēl's son rather than the son of Dagan as he is normally called, possibly because Ēl is in the position of a clan-father to all the gods.\n\nThe fragmentary text R.S. 24.258 describes a banquet to which Ēl invites the other gods and then disgraces himself by becoming outrageously drunk and passing out after confronting an otherwise unknown Hubbay, \"he with the horns and tail\". The text ends with an incantation for the cure of some disease, possibly hang-over.\n\nThe Hebrew form (אל) appears in Latin letters in Standard Hebrew transcription as El and in Tiberian Hebrew transcription as ʾĒl. \"El\" is a generic word for \"god\" that could be used for any god, including Hadad, Moloch, or Yahweh. \n\nIn the Tanakh, \"’lōhîm\" is the normal word for a god or the great god (or gods, given that the 'im' suffix makes a word plural in Hebrew). But the form \"’El\" also appears, mostly in poetic passages and in the patriarchal narratives attributed to the Priestly source of the documentary hypothesis. It occurs 217 times in the Masoretic Text: seventy-three times in the Psalms and fifty-five times in the Book of Job, and otherwise mostly in poetic passages or passages written in elevated prose. It occasionally appears with the definite article as \"hā’Ēl\" 'the god' (for example in ).\n\nThe theological position of the Tanakh is that the names \"Ēl\" and \"’Ĕlōhîm\", when used in the singular to mean the supreme god, refer to Yahweh, beside whom other gods are supposed to be either nonexistent or insignificant. Whether this was a long-standing belief or a relatively new one has long been the subject of inconclusive scholarly debate about the prehistory of the sources of the Tanakh and about the prehistory of Israelite religion. In the P strand, YHWH says in :\nI revealed myself to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Ēl Shaddāi, but was not known to them by my name, YHVH.\n\nBefore El's revelation with the name of Yahweh, it is said in that Abraham accepted the blessing of El, when Melchizedek, the king of Salem and high priest of its deity El Elyon blessed him. One scholarly position is that the identification of Yahweh with Ēl is late, that Yahweh was earlier thought of as only one of many gods, and not normally identified with Ēl. Another is that in much of the Hebrew Bible the name El is an alternate name for Yahweh, but in the Elohist and Priestly traditions it is conceived as an earlier name than Yahweh. Mark Smith has argued that Yahweh and El were originally separate, but were considered synonymous from very early on. The name Yahweh is used in the Bible Tanakh in the first book of ; and says that at that time, people began to \"call upon the name of the LORD\".\n\nIn some places, especially in , Yahweh is clearly envisioned as a storm god, something not true of Ēl so far as we know (although true of his son, Ba'al Hadad). It is Yahweh who is prophesied to one day battle Leviathan the serpent, and slay the dragon in the sea in . The slaying of the serpent in myth is a deed attributed to both Ba’al Hadad and ‘Anat in the Ugaritic texts, but not to Ēl.\n\nSuch mythological motifs are variously seen as late survivals from a period when Yahweh held a place in theology comparable to that of Hadad at Ugarit; or as late henotheistic/monotheistic applications to Yahweh of deeds more commonly attributed to Hadad; or simply as examples of eclectic application of the same motifs and imagery to various different gods. Similarly, it is argued inconclusively whether Ēl Shaddāi, Ēl ‘Ôlām, Ēl ‘Elyôn, and so forth, were originally understood as separate divinities. Albrecht Alt presented his theories on the original differences of such gods in \"Der Gott der Väter\" in 1929. But others have argued that from patriarchal times, these different names were in fact generally understood to refer to the same single great god, Ēl. This is the position of Frank Moore Cross (1973). What is certain is that the form ’El does appear in Israelite names from every period including the name \"Yiśrā’ēl\" (\"Israel\"), meaning \"El strives\" or \"struggled with El\".\n\nAccording to \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\",\n\nIt seems almost certain that the God of the Jews evolved gradually from the Canaanite El, who was in all likelihood the \"God of Abraham\"... If El was the high God of Abraham—Elohim, the prototype of Yahveh—Asherah was his wife, and there are archaeological indications that she was perceived as such before she was in effect \"divorced\" in the context of emerging Judaism of the 7th century BCE. (See .)\n\nThe apparent plural form \"’Ēlîm\" or \"’Ēlim\" \"gods\" occurs only four times in the Tanakh. , understood as an enthronement psalm, begins:\n\nTraditionally \"bnê ’ēlîm\" has been interpreted as 'sons of the mighty', 'mighty ones', for \"’El\" can mean 'mighty', though such use may be metaphorical (compare the English expression \"[by] God awful\"). It is possible also that the expression \"’ēlîm\" in both places descends from an archaic stock phrase in which \"’lm\" was a singular form with the \"m\"-enclitic and therefore to be translated as 'sons of Ēl'. The \"m\"-enclitic appears elsewhere in the Tanakh and in other Semitic languages. Its meaning is unknown, possibly simply emphasis. It appears in similar contexts in Ugaritic texts where the expression \"bn ’il\" alternates with \"bn ’ilm\", but both must mean 'sons of Ēl'. That phrase with \"m\"-enclitic also appears in Phoenician inscriptions as late as the fifth century BCE.\n\nOne of the other two occurrences in the Tanakh is in the \"Song of Moses\", :\n\nWho is like you among the Gods (\"’ēlim\"), Yahweh?\n\nThe final occurrence is in :\n\nAnd the king will do according to his pleasure; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself over every god (\"’ēl\"), and against the God of Gods (\"’El ’Elîm\") he will speak outrageous things, and will prosper until the indignation is accomplished: for that which is decided will be done.\n\nThere are a few cases in the Tanakh where some think \"’El\" referring to the great god Ēl is not equated with Yahweh. One is in , in the taunt against a man who claims to be divine, in this instance, the leader of Tyre:\n\nSon of man, say to the prince of Tyre: \"Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because your heart is proud and you have said: \"I am \"’ēl\" (god), in the seat of \"’lōhîm\" (\"gods\"), I am enthroned in the middle of the seas.\" Yet you are man and not \"’El\" even though you have made your heart like the heart of \"’lōhîm\" ('gods').\n\nHere \"’ēl\" might refer to a generic god, or to a highest god, Ēl. When viewed as applying to the King of Tyre specifically, the king was probably not thinking of Yahweh. When viewed as a general taunt against anyone making divine claims, it may or may not refer to Yahweh depending on the context.\n\nIn we find \"’Ēl Brît\" 'God of the Covenant', seemingly the same as the \"Ba‘al Brît\" 'Lord of the Covenant' whose worship has been condemned a few verses earlier. See Baal for a discussion of this passage.\n\nThis could mean that Yahweh judges along with many other gods as one of the council of the high god Ēl. However it can also mean that Yahweh stands in the Divine Council (generally known as the Council of Ēl), as Ēl judging among the other members of the Council. The following verses in which the god condemns those whom he says were previously named \"gods\" (\"Elohim\") and \"sons of the Most High\" suggest the god here is in fact Ēl judging the lesser gods.\n\nAn archaic phrase appears in , \"kôkkbê ’ēl\" 'stars of God', referring to the circumpolar stars that never set, possibly especially to the seven stars of Ursa Major. The phrase also occurs in the Pyrgi Inscription as \"hkkbm ’l\" (preceded by the definite article \"h\" and followed by the \"m\"-enclitic). Two other apparent fossilized expressions are \"arzê-’ēl\" 'cedars of God' (generally translated something like 'mighty cedars', 'goodly cedars') in (in Hebrew verse 11) and \"kharrê-’ēl\" 'mountains of God' (generally translated something like 'great mountains', 'mighty mountains') in (in Hebrew verse 6).\n\nFor the reference in some texts of to seventy sons of God corresponding to the seventy sons of Ēl in the Ugaritic texts, see `Elyôn.\n\nPhilo of Byblos (c. 64–141 AD) was a Greek writer whose account \"Sanchuniathon\" survives in quotation by Eusebius and may contain the major surviving traces of Phoenician mythology. Ēl (rendered \"Elus\" or called by his standard Greek counterpart Cronus) is not the creator God or first God. Ēl is rather the son of Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Ge). Sky and Earth are themselves children of ‘Elyôn 'Most High'. Ēl is brother to the God Bethel, to Dagon and to an unknown god, equated with the Greek Atlas and to the goddesses Aphrodite/’Ashtart, Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (equated with Ba‘alat Gebal). Ēl is the father of Persephone and of Athena (presumably the goddess ‘Anat).\n\nSky and Earth have separated from one another in hostility, but Sky insists on continuing to force himself on Earth and attempts to destroy the children born of such unions. At last, Ēl, with the advice of his daughter Athena and the god Hermes Trismegistus (perhaps Thoth), Ēl successfully attacks his father Sky with a sickle and spear of iron. He and his military allies the \"Eloim\" gain Sky's kingdom.\n\nIn a later passage it is explained that Ēl castrated Sky. One of Sky's concubines (who was given to Ēl's brother Dagon) was already pregnant by Sky. The son who is born of the union, called Demarûs or Zeus, but once called Adodus, is obviously Hadad, the Ba‘al of the Ugaritic texts who now becomes an ally of his grandfather Sky and begins to make war on Ēl.\n\nĒl has three wives, his sisters or half-sisters Aphrodite/Astarte (‘Ashtart), Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (identified by Sanchuniathon with Ba‘alat Gebal the tutelary goddess of Byblos, a city which Sanchuniathon says that Ēl founded).\n\nEl is depicted primarily as a warrior; in Ugaritic sources Baal has the warrior role and El is peaceful, and it may be that the \"Sanchuniathon\" depicts an earlier tradition that was more preserved in the southern regions of Canaan.\n\nEusebius, through whom the \"Sanchuniathon\" is preserved, is not interested in setting the work forth completely or in order. But we are told that Ēl slew his own son Sadidus (a name that some commentators think might be a corruption of \"Shaddai\", one of the epithets of the Biblical Ēl) and that Ēl also beheaded one of his daughters. Later, perhaps referring to this same death of Sadidus we are told:\n\nA fuller account of the sacrifice appears later:\nThe account also relates that Thoth:\nThis is the form under which Ēl/Cronus appears on coins from Byblos from the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 BCE) four spread wings and two folded wings, leaning on a staff. Such images continued to appear on coins until after the time of Augustus.\n\nA bilingual inscription from Palmyra dated to the 1st century equates \"Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth\" with the Greek god Poseidon. Going back to the 8th century BCE, the bilingual inscription at Karatepe in the Taurus Mountains equates \"Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth\" to Luwian hieroglyphs read as \"a-a-ś\", this being the Luwian form of the name of the Babylonian water god Ea, lord of the abyss of water under the earth. (This inscription lists Ēl in second place in the local pantheon, following Ba‘al Shamîm and preceding the \"Eternal Sun\".)\n\nPoseidon is known to have been worshipped in Beirut, his image appearing on coins from that city. Poseidon of Beirut was also worshipped at Delos where there was an association of merchants, shipmasters, and warehousemen called the Poseidoniastae of Berytus founded in 110 or 109 BCE. Three of the four chapels at its headquarters on the hill northwest of the Sacred Lake were dedicated to Poseidon, the Tyche of the city equated with Astarte (that is ‘Ashtart), and to Eshmun.\n\nAlso at Delos, that association of Tyrians, though mostly devoted to Heracles-Melqart, elected a member to bear a crown every year when sacrifices to Poseidon took place. A banker named Philostratus donated two altars, one to Palaistine Aphrodite Urania (‘Ashtart) and one to Poseidon \"of Ascalon\".\n\nThough Sanchuniathon distinguishes Poseidon from his Elus/Cronus, this might be a splitting off of a particular aspect of Ēl in a euhemeristic account. Identification of an aspect of Ēl with Poseidon rather than with Cronus might have been felt to better fit with Hellenistic religious practice, if indeed this Phoenician Poseidon really is Ēl who dwells at the source of the two deeps in Ugaritic texts. More information is needed to be certain.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59787", "title": "Loanword", "text": "Loanword\n\nA loanword (also loan word or loan-word) is a word adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without translation. This is in contrast to cognates, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an etymological origin, and calques, which involve translation.\n\nA loanword is distinguished from a calque (or loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose meaning or idiom is adopted from another language by word-for-word translation into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language.\n\nExamples of loanwords in the English language include \"café\" (from French \"café\", which literally means \"coffee\"), bazaar (from Persian \"bāzār\", which means \"market\"), and kindergarten (from German \"Kindergarten\", which literally means \"children's garden\").\n\nIn a bit of heterological irony, the word \"calque\" is an importation from the French noun, derived from the verb \"calquer\" (to trace, to copy); the word \"loanword\" is a calque of the German word \"Lehnwort\"; and the phrase \"loan translation\" is a calque of the German \"Lehnübersetzung\".\n\nLoans of multi-word phrases, such as the English use of the French term \"déjà vu\", are known as adoptions, adaptations, or lexical borrowings.\n\nStrictly speaking, the term \"loanword\" conflicts with the ordinary meaning of \"loan\" in that something is taken from the donor language without it being something that is possible to return.\n\nThe terms substrate and superstrate are often used when two languages interact. (However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).\n\nMost of the technical vocabulary of classical music (such as concerto, allegro, tempo, aria, opera, and soprano) is borrowed from Italian, and that of ballet from French.\n\nThe studies by Werner Betz (1949, 1939), Einar Haugen (1950, also 1956), and Uriel Weinreich (1953) are regarded as the classical theoretical works on loan influence. The basic theoretical statements all take Betz's nomenclature as their starting point. Duckworth (1977) enlarges Betz's scheme by the type “partial substitution” and supplements the system with English terms. A schematic illustration of these classifications is given below.\n\nThe expression \"foreign word\" used in the illustration below is, however, an incorrect translation of the German term \"Fremdwort\", which refers to loanwords whose pronunciation, spelling, and possible inflection or gender have not yet been so much adapted to the new language that they cease to feel foreign. Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. In addition, basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is (or, in fact, was) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time.\n\nAccording to the linguist Suzanne Kemmer, the expression \"foreign word\" can be defined as follows in English: \"[W]hen most speakers do not know the word and if they hear it think it is from another language, the word can be called a foreign word. There are many foreign words and phrases used in English such as bon vivant (French), mutatis mutandis (Latin), and Schadenfreude (German).\" This is however not how the term is (incorrectly) used in this illustration:\n\nOn the basis of an importation-substitution distinction, Haugen (1950: 214f.) distinguishes three basic groups of borrowings: “(1) \"Loanwords\" show morphemic importation without substitution... (2) \"Loanblends\" show morphemic substitution as well as importation... (3) \"Loanshifts\" show morphemic substitution without importation”. Haugen later refined (1956) his model in a review of Gneuss's (1955) book on Old English loan coinages, whose classification, in turn, is the one by Betz (1949) again.\n\nWeinreich (1953: 47ff.) differentiates between two mechanisms of lexical interference, namely those initiated by simple words and those initiated by compound words and phrases. Weinreich (1953: 47) defines \"simple words\" “from the point of view of the bilinguals who perform the transfer, rather than that of the descriptive linguist. Accordingly, the category ‘simple’ words also includes compounds that are transferred in unanalysed form”. After this general classification, Weinreich then resorts to Betz's (1949) terminology.\n\nPopular loanwords are transmitted orally. \nLearned loanwords are first used in written language, often for scholarly, scientific, or literary purposes.\n\nThe English language has often borrowed words from other cultures or languages:\n\nSome English loanwords remain relatively faithful to the donor language's phonology even though a particular phoneme might not exist or have contrastive status in English. For example, the Hawaiian word \"aā\" is used by geologists to specify lava that is relatively thick, chunky, and rough. The Hawaiian spelling indicates the two glottal stops in the word, but the English pronunciation, , contains at most one. In addition, the English spelling usually removes the ʻokina and macron diacritics.\n\nThe majority of English affixes, such as \"un-\", \"-ing\", and \"-ly\", were present in older forms in Old English. However, a few English affixes are borrowed. For example, the English verbal suffix \"-ize\" (American English) or \"ise\" (British English) comes from Greek -ιζειν (\"-izein\") via Latin \"-izare\".\n\nDuring more than 600 years of the Ottoman Empire, the literary and administrative language of the empire was Turkish, with many Persian, and Arabic loanwords, called Ottoman Turkish, considerably differing from the everyday spoken Turkish of the time. Many such words were exported to other languages of the empire, such as Albanian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Hungarian, Ladino, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian. After the empire fell after World War I and the Republic of Turkey was founded, the Turkish language underwent an extensive language reform led by the newly founded Turkish Language Association, during which many adopted words were replaced with new formations derived from Turkic roots. That was part of the ongoing cultural reform of the time, in turn a part in the broader framework of Atatürk's Reforms, which also included the introduction of the new Turkish alphabet.\n\nTurkish also has taken many words from French, such as \"pantolon\" for \"trousers\" (from French \"pantalon\") and \"komik\" for \"funny\" (from French \"comique\"), most of them pronounced very similarly. Word usage in modern Turkey has acquired a political tinge: right-wing publications tend to use more Arabic or Persian originated words, left-wing ones use more adopted from European languages, while centrist ones use more native Turkish root words.\n\nAlmost 350 years of Dutch presence in what is now Indonesia have left significant linguistic traces. Though very few Indonesians have a fluent knowledge of Dutch, the Indonesian language inherited many words from Dutch, both in words for everyday life (e.g., \"buncis\" from Dutch \"boontjes\" for (green) beans) and as well in administrative, scientific or technological terminology (e.g., \"kantor\" from Dutch \"kantoor\" for office). One scholar argues that roughly 20% of Indonesian words can be traced back to Dutch words.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the Dutch Republic had a leading position in shipbuilding. Czar Peter the Great, eager to improve his navy, studied shipbuilding in Zaandam and Amsterdam. Many Dutch naval terms have been incorporated in the Russian vocabulary, such as бра́мсель (\"brámselʹ\") from Dutch \"bramzeil\" for the topgallant sail, домкра́т (\"domkrát\") from Dutch \"dommekracht\" for jack, and матро́с (\"matrós\") from Dutch \"matroos\" for sailor.\n\nA large percentage of the lexicon of Romance languages, themselves descended from Vulgar Latin, consists of loanwords (later learned or scholarly borrowings) from Latin. These words can be distinguished by lack of typical sound changes and other transformations found in descended words, or by meanings taken directly from Classical or Ecclesiastical Latin that did not evolve or change over time as expected; in addition, there are also semi-learned terms which were adapted partially to the Romance language's character. Latin borrowings can be known by several names in Romance languages: in Spanish, for example, they are usually referred to as \"cultismos\", and in Italian as \"latinismi\".\n\nLatin is usually the most common source of loanwords in these languages, such as in Italian, Spanish, French, etc., and in some cases the total number of loans may even outnumber inherited terms (although the learned borrowings are less often used in common speech, with the most common vocabulary being of inherited, orally transmitted origin from Vulgar Latin). This has led to many cases of etymological doublets in these languages.\n\nFor most Romance languages, these loans were initiated by scholars, clergy, or other learned people and occurred in Medieval times, peaking in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance era- in Italian, the 14th century had the highest number of loans. In the case of Romanian, the language underwent a \"re-Latinization\" process later than the others (see Romanian lexis, ), in the 18th and 19th centuries, partially using French and Italian words (many of these themselves being earlier borrowings from Latin) as intermediaries, in an effort to modernize the language, often adding concepts that did not exist until then, or replacing words of other origins. These common borrowings and features also essentially serve to raise mutual intelligibility of the Romance languages, particularly in academic/scholarly, literary, technical, and scientific domains. Many of these same words are also found in English (through its numerous borrowings from Latin and French) and other European languages.\n\nIn addition to Latin loanwords, many words of Ancient Greek origin were also borrowed into Romance languages, often in part through scholarly Latin intermediates, and these also often pertained to academic, scientific, literary, and technical topics. Furthermore, to a lesser extent, Romance languages borrowed from a variety of other languages; in particular English has become an important source in more recent times. Study of the origin of these words and their function and context within the language can illuminate some important aspects and characteristics of the language, and can reveal insights on the general phenomenon of lexical borrowing in linguistics as a method of enriching a language.\n\nAccording to Hans Henrich Hock and Brian Joseph, \"languages and dialects ... do not exist in a vacuum\": there is always linguistic contact between groups. The contact influences what loanwords are integrated into the lexicon and which certain words are chosen over others.\n\nIn some cases, the original meaning shifts considerably through unexpected logical leaps. The English word \"Viking\" became Japanese バイキング (\"baikingu\"), meaning \"buffet\", because the first restaurant in Japan to offer buffet-style meals, inspired by the Nordic smörgåsbord, was opened in 1958 by the Imperial Hotel under the name \"Viking\". The German word \"Kachel\", meaning \"tile\", became the Dutch word \"kachel\" meaning \"stove\", as a shortening of \"kacheloven\", from German \"Kachelofen\", a tiled stove.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "60379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60379", "title": "Aioli", "text": "Aioli\n\nAioli or aïoli ( or ; Provençal or \"aiòli\" ; ) is a Mediterranean sauce made of garlic and olive oil; some regions use other emulsifiers such as egg. The names mean \"garlic and oil\" in Catalan and Provençal. It is found in the cuisines of the Mediterranean coasts of Spain (Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, Murcia and eastern Andalusia), France (Provence) and Italy (Sicily and Calabria). Current versions of the French-Provençal sauce are closer to a garlic mayonnaise, incorporating egg yolks and lemon juice, whereas the original French-Provençal and Catalan versions are without egg yolk and have more garlic. This gives the sauce a pastier texture, while making it more laborious to make as the emulsion is harder to stabilize. There are many variations, such as adding lemon juice or other seasonings. In France it may include mustard. It is served at room temperature.\n\nLike mayonnaise, aioli is an emulsion or suspension of small globules of oil and oil-soluble compounds in water and water-soluble compounds. In Spain, purists believe that the absence of egg distinguishes aioli from mayonnaise, but that is not the case in France and other countries, where cooks may use egg or egg yolk as an emulsifier. Using only garlic as an emulsifier requires that the cook thoroughly crush it and add oil drop by drop so excess oil does not \"cut\" the aioli.\n\nSince the late 1980s, many people have called all flavored mayonnaises \"aioli\". Flavorings include saffron and chili. Purists insist that flavored mayonnaise can contain garlic, but true aioli contains no seasoning other than garlic.\n\nThe word is a compound of the words meaning \"garlic\" and \"oil\". \n\nThe English spelling comes from the French \"aïoli\", which itself comes from Occitan. The spelling in Occitan may be \"alhòli\", following the classical norm, or \"aiòli\", following the Mistralian norm. In Catalan, it is spelled \"allioli\" (). In southeastern Spain, it is called \"ajoaceite\" or \"ajiaceite\", whereas in the rest of Spain, the Catalan term is more common. In Galician and Spanish, it is spelled \"alioli\".\n\nGarlic is crushed in a mortar and pestle and emulsified with salt, and olive oil. Today, aioli is often made in a food processor or blender, but traditionalists object that this does not give the same result.\n\nIn Malta, arjoli or ajjoli is commonly made with the addition of either crushed galletti or tomato.\n\nIn Occitan cuisine, \"aioli\" is typically served with seafood, fish soup, and croutons. An example is a dish called \"merluça amb alhòli\".\n\nIn the Occitan Valleys of Italy it is served with potatoes boiled with salt and bay laurel.\n\nIn Provence, \"aioli\" or, more formally, \"le grand aïoli\", \"aioli garni\", or \"aïoli monstre\" is a dish consisting of various boiled vegetables (usually carrots, potatoes, artichokes, and green beans), poached fish (normally soaked salt cod), snails, canned tuna, other seafood, and boiled eggs, all served with \"aioli\". This dish is often served during the festivities on the feast days of the patron saint of Provençal villages and towns. It is traditional to serve it with snails for Christmas Eve and with cod on Ash Wednesday. Aïoli is so strongly associated with Provence that when the poet Frédéric Mistral started a regionalist Provençal-language newspaper in 1891, he called it \"L'Aiòli\".\n\nIn Spain, \"allioli\" is often served with arròs a banda from Alicante, with grilled lamb, grilled vegetables and arròs negre, and comes in other varieties such as allioli de codony (allioli with boiled quince, not the preserve) or allioli with boiled pear. Other commonly used vegetables are beets, fennel, celery, zucchini, cauliflower, chick peas, and raw tomato.\n\n"}
{"id": "60455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60455", "title": "Line-of-sight propagation", "text": "Line-of-sight propagation\n\nLine-of-sight propagation is a characteristic of electromagnetic radiation or acoustic wave propagation which means waves travel in a direct path from the source to the receiver. Electromagnetic transmission includes light emissions traveling in a straight line. The rays or waves may be diffracted, refracted, reflected, or absorbed by the atmosphere and obstructions with material and generally cannot travel over the horizon or behind obstacles.\n\nIn contrast to line-of-sight propagation, at low frequency (below approximately 3 MHz) due to diffraction, radio waves can travel as ground waves, which follow the contour of the Earth. This enables AM radio stations to transmit beyond the horizon. Additionally, frequencies in the shortwave bands between approximately 1 and 30 MHz, can be reflected back to Earth by the ionosphere, called skywave or \"skip\" propagation, thus giving radio transmissions in this range a potentially global reach. \n\nHowever, at frequencies above 30 MHz (VHF and higher) and in lower levels of the atmosphere, neither of these effects are significant. Thus, any obstruction between the transmitting antenna (transmitter) and the receiving antenna (receiver) will block the signal, just like the light that the eye may sense. Therefore, since the ability to visually see a transmitting antenna (disregarding the limitations of the eye's resolution) roughly corresponds to the ability to receive a radio signal from it, the propagation characteristic at these frequencies is called \"line-of-sight\". The farthest possible point of propagation is referred to as the \"radio horizon\".\n\nIn practice, the propagation characteristics of these radio waves vary substantially depending on the exact frequency and the strength of the transmitted signal (a function of both the transmitter and the antenna characteristics). Broadcast FM radio, at comparatively low frequencies of around 100 MHz, are less affected by the presence of buildings and forests.\n\nLow-powered microwave transmitters can be foiled by tree branches, or even heavy rain or snow. The presence of objects not in the direct line-of-sight can cause diffraction effects that disrupt radio transmissions. For the best propagation, a volume known as the first Fresnel zone should be free of obstructions. \n\nReflected radiation from the surface of the surrounding ground or salt water can also either cancel out or enhance the direct signal. This effect can be reduced by raising either or both antennas further from the ground: The reduction in loss achieved is known as \"height gain\".\n\nSee also Non-line-of-sight propagation for more on impairments in propagation.\n\nIt is important to take into account the curvature of the Earth for calculation of line-of-sight paths from maps, when a direct visual fix cannot be made. Designs for microwave formerly used  earth radius to compute clearances along the path.\n\nAlthough the frequencies used by mobile phones (cell phones) are in the line-of-sight range, they still function in cities. This is made possible by a combination of the following effects:\n\nThe combination of all these effects makes the mobile phone propagation environment highly complex, with multipath effects and extensive Rayleigh fading. For mobile phone services, these problems are tackled using:\n\nA Faraday cage is composed of a conductor that completely surrounds an area on all sides, top, and bottom. Electromagnetic radiation is blocked where the wavelength is longer than any gaps. For example, mobile telephone signals are blocked in windowless metal enclosures that approximate a Faraday cage, such as elevator cabins, and parts of trains, cars, and ships. The same problem can affect signals in buildings with extensive steel reinforcement.\n\nThe \"radio horizon\" is the locus of points at which direct rays from an antenna are tangential to the surface of the Earth. If the Earth were a perfect sphere without an atmosphere, the radio horizon would be a circle. \n\nThe radio horizon of the transmitting and receiving antennas can be added together to increase the effective communication range. \n\nRadio wave propagation is affected by atmospheric conditions, ionospheric absorption, and the presence of obstructions, for example mountains or trees. \nSimple formulas that include the effect of the atmosphere give the range as:\n\nThe simple formulas give a best-case approximation of the maximum propagation distance, but are not sufficient to estimate the quality of service at any location.\n\n\"Earth bulge\" is a term used in telecommunications. It refers to the circular segment of earth profile that blocks off long distance communications. Since the geometric line of sight passes at varying heights over the Earth, the propagating radio wave encounters slightly different propagation conditions over the path. The usual effect of the declining pressure of the atmosphere with height is to bend radio waves down towards the surface of the Earth, effectively increasing the Earth's radius, and the distance to the radio horizon, by a factor around . This \"k\"-factor can change from its average value depending on weather.\n\nAssuming a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity, the distance to the horizon from a high altitude transmitter (i.e., line of sight) can readily be calculated.\n\nLet \"R\" be the radius of the Earth and \"h\" be the altitude of a telecommunication station. The line of sight distance \"d\" of this station is given by the Pythagorean theorem;\n\nSince the altitude of the station is much less than the radius of the Earth,\n\nIf the height is given in metres, and distance in kilometres,\n\nIf the height is given in feet, and the distance in miles,\n\nThe above analysis does not consider the effect of atmosphere on the propagation path of RF signals. In fact, RF signals don’t propagate in straight lines: Because of the refractive effects of atmospheric layers, the propagation paths are somewhat curved. Thus, the maximum service range of the station is not equal to the line of sight (geometric) distance. Usually, a factor \"k\" is used in the equation above, modified to be\n\n\"k\" > 1 means geometrically reduced bulge and a longer service range. On the other hand, \"k\" < 1 means a shorter service range.\n\nUnder normal weather conditions, \"k\" is usually chosen to be . That means that the maximum service range increases by 15%.\n\nfor \"h\" in metres and \"d\" in kilometres; or\n\nfor \"h\" in feet and \"d\" in miles.\n\nBut in stormy weather, \"k\" may decrease to cause fading in transmission. (In extreme cases \"k\" can be less than 1.) That is equivalent to a hypothetical decrease in Earth radius and an increase of Earth bulge.\n\nIn normal weather conditions, the service range of a station at an altitude of 1500 m with respect to receivers at sea level can be found as,\n\n"}
{"id": "61123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61123", "title": "Red Bull", "text": "Red Bull\n\nRed Bull is an energy drink sold by Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian company created in 1987. Red Bull has the highest market share of any energy drink in the world, with 6.790 billion cans sold in a year ().\n\nAustrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz was inspired by an existing energy drink named Krating Daeng, which was first introduced and sold in Thailand by Chaleo Yoovidhya. He took this idea, modified the ingredients to suit the tastes of Westerners, and, in partnership with Chaleo, founded Red Bull GmbH in 1987 in Chakkapong, Thailand. In Thai, \"daeng\" means red, and a \"krating\" (known in English as a gaur or Indian bison) is a large species of wild bovine native to South Asia. Yoovidhya's heirs own majority stakes in both brands, and they both use the same red bull on yellow sun logo while continuing to market the separate drinks to the respective Thai and Western markets.\n\nRed Bull is sold in a tall and slim blue-silver can. Originally only available in a single nondescript flavor and regular or sugar-free formulas, a line of \"color editions\" with artificial fruit flavors were added to the line beginning in 2013. The Red Bull company slogan is \"Red Bull gives you wings\". Rather than following a traditional approach to mass marketing, Red Bull has generated awareness and created a 'brand myth' through proprietary extreme sport event series such as Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Red Bull Air Race, Red Bull Crashed Ice and stand-out stunts such as the Stratos space diving project.\n\nRed Bull's marketing arsenal also includes multiple sports team ownerships (Formula One teams Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso, football clubs RB Leipzig, FC Red Bull Salzburg, FC Liefering, Red Bull Brasil and New York Red Bulls), celebrity endorsements, and music, through its record label Red Bull Records.\n\nEnergy drinks have been associated with health risks, such as masking the effects of intoxication when consumed with alcohol, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that an adequate consumption of Red Bull and other popular energy drinks is safe and that the amount of caffeine in standard Red Bull cans is unlikely to interact adversely with other typical constituents of energy drinks or with alcohol. Energy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar give, but there is no distinct evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients has any effect.\n\nIn 1976, Chaleo Yoovidhya introduced a drink called Krating Daeng in Thailand, which means \"red gaur\" in English. It was popular among Thai truck drivers and labourers. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter & Gamble) in 1982, Dietrich Mateschitz travelled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of T.C. Pharmaceutical. During his visit, Mateschitz discovered that Krating Daeng helped cure his jet lag. In 1984, Mateschitz co-founded Red Bull GmbH with Yoovidhya and turned it into an international brand. Each partner invested US$500,000 of savings to found the company. Yoovidhya and Mateschitz each held a 49 percent share of the new company. They gave the remaining two percent to Yoovidhya's son, Chalerm, but it was agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. The product was launched in Austria in 1987.\n\nIn Thailand, energy drinks are most popular with blue-collar workers. Red Bull re-positioned the drink as a trendy, upscale drink, first introducing it at Austrian ski resorts. Pricing was a key differentiator, with Red Bull positioned as a premium drink and Krating Daeng as a lower cost item. In many countries, both drinks are available, dominating both ends of the price spectrum.\n\nIn 1992, the product expanded to Hungary and Slovenia. It entered the United States via California in 1997 and the Middle East in 2000. In 2008, \"Forbes\" magazine listed both Chaleo and Mateschitz as the 250th richest people in the world with an estimated net worth of US$4 billion.\n\nRed Bull GmbH is headquartered in Fuschl am See, an Austrian village of about 1,500 inhabitants near Salzburg. The company is 51 percent controlled by the Yoovidhya family who, for technical reasons, own the trademark in Europe and the US.\n\nIn 1995, Krating Daeng authorized its drink. labelled as Red Bull, to be sold in China. Since 2014, the Austrian Red Bull (carbonated) has also been exported to China. This has created confusion since both drinks use the same brand name, in both English and Chinese.\n\nSimilarly, in Southeast Asia, Red Bull and Krating Daeng are often confused as both use the Red Bull name in their packaging, although they are two separate products aimed at different markets. The main difference is that Red Bull comes in a tall blue and silver can while the Thailand Red Bull, or Krating Daeng, is in a smaller gold can. The two drinks also differ in terms of taste—Red Bull has less sugar and is carbonated. The flavouring used for Red Bull is still produced in Bangkok and exported worldwide.\n\nDepending on the country Red Bull contains caffeine, taurine, B vitamins (B3, B5, B6, B12) and simple sugars (sucrose and glucose) in a buffer solution of carbonated water, baking soda and magnesium carbonate. To produce Red Bull Sugarfree, sugars sucrose and glucose have been replaced by the sweeteners acesulfame K and aspartame/sucralose.\n\nRed Bull identifies its flavors as \"editions.\"\n\n\n\nSeveral of these flavors have been rebranded for special events (the special grapefruit flavor, for example, has been branded as the \"Bull\" Edition, the \"Red Italian\" Edition, and the \"F1 Edition\").\n\nClaims about the drink's effects and performance have been challenged on various occasions, with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority imposing advertising restrictions in 2001 in response to complaints recorded as early as 1997.\n\nEnergy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar provide, but experts still argue about the possible effects of the other ingredients. Most of the effects of energy drinks on cognitive performance, such as increased attention and reaction speed, are primarily due to the presence of caffeine. There is evidence that energy drinks can increase mental and athletic performance. Performance during prolonged driving is increased after consumption of Red Bull. Other tests for physical performance showed results such as increased endurance and power. Red Bull energy drink increased upper body muscle endurance during repeated Wingate tests in young healthy adults. Excessive or repeated consumption of energy drinks can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions.\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that exposure to taurine and glucuronolactone at the levels presently used in energy drinks is not a safety concern. In a separate analysis, they also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a number of commercial health claims about taurine. A review published in 2008 found no documented reports of negative or positive health effects associated with the amount of taurine used in energy drinks, including Red Bull. The review also states that though the caffeine and sugar levels in the energy drink are comparable to those present in coffee and fruit juice respectively, these levels have been shown to cause adverse health effects.\nIn its scientific opinion on the safety of caffeine of 2015, the EFSA concluded that \"consumption of other constituents of energy drinks at concentrations commonly present in such beverages would not affect the safety of single doses of caffeine up to 200 mg.\" Also, the consumption of alcohol, leading to a blood alcohol content of about 0.08%, would, according to the EFSA, not affect the safety of single doses of caffeine up to 200 mg. Up to these levels of intake, caffeine is unlikely to mask the subjective perception of alcohol intoxication. Habitual use of caffeine up to 400 mg per day does not.\n\nAccording to SAMHSA, \"the number of emergency department (ED) visits\" among people over age 12 related to energy drinks doubled between 2007 and 2011 in the US (from 10,068 to 20,783).\n\nThe caffeine content of a single can of Red Bull is 80 mg/250 ml (32 mg/100 ml). This is about the same as one cup of coffee, or slightly less depending on the brewing method. The actual caffeine level in Red Bull can vary depending on country, as some countries have legal restrictions on how much caffeine is allowed in drinks. As is the case with other caffeinated beverages, Red Bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse. Excessive consumption may induce mild to moderate euphoria primarily caused by stimulant properties of caffeine and may also induce agitation, anxiety, irritability and insomnia.\n\nThe general population of healthy adults is not at risk for potential adverse effects from caffeine if they limit their consumption to 400 mg per day, which is the equivalent of 5 standard cans, with one can being 250ml in volume. Consumption of a single energy drink will not lead to excessive caffeine intake. Adverse effects associated with caffeine consumption in amounts greater than 400 mg include nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, increased urination, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia), and dyspepsia. Consumption also has been known to cause pupil dilation when taken with certain antidepressants or SSRIs. Caffeine dosage is not required to be on the product label for food in the United States, unlike drugs, but some advocates are urging the FDA to change this practice. (Red Bull voluntarily lists the caffeine content in each can along with the ingredient list.)\n\nAuthorities in France, Denmark, and Norway initially kept Red Bull from being sold domestically. However, , it is on sale in all 28 member states of the European Union and in more than 167 countries around the world.\n\nThe French food safety agency was concerned about taurine. A Red Bull drink that did not contain taurine was introduced. The French refusal of market approval was challenged by the European Commission, and partially upheld by the European Court of Justice in 2004. The French food safety agency relented in 2008, because it was unable to prove a definite health risk, taurine-related or not.\n\nIn 2012, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Commerce banned Red Bull for people under 16 after it had allegedly caused heart attacks for a 16-year-old and a 21-year-old national squash team player.\n\nIn 2013, Red Bull told the Redwell Brewery, a Norfolk micro brewery, to change its name or face legal action, because it sounded too similar to Red Bull. The eight-man brewery in Norwich was told its name could \"confuse\" customers and \"tarnish\" its trademark. The two companies reached a settlement permitting Redwell to continue using its name.\n\nIn 2014, Red Bull faced a US$13 million settlement addressing two consumer class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The listed plaintiffs were Benjamin Careathers, David Wolf, and Miguel Almarez who sued the company for Red Bull's marketing and labeling, claiming that the company violated \"express warranty and unjust enrichment\" since their products were first launched by claiming performance-enhancing benefits from the drink's ingredients which were not substantiated by scientific studies. The court hearing took place the morning of 1 May 2015 in an attempt to determine approval for the settlement. Customers that submitted claims then have the opportunity to receive a US$10 cash reimbursement or product option of US$15 in Red Bull products within 150 days of the approved appeals. Contrary to false reports from some news outlets, the lawsuit was not about the drink failing to give the consumer actual wings.\n\nSince 1997, Red Bull has been making commercials bearing its slogan \"Red Bull gives you wings,\" but also occasionally bearing \"No Red Bull, no wings.\" \n\nRed Bull's international marketing campaign targets young men mostly with extreme sports. These range from mountain biking, BMX, motocross, windsurfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, kayaking, rowing, wakeboarding, cliff-diving, parkour, surfing, skating, freestyle motocross, rallycross, Formula 1 racing, NASCAR racing, to breakdancing. Red Bull uses music and videogames, and has enlisted celebrities, such as Eminem (sponsoring the Red Bull \"EmSee Battle Rap championships\"). It hosts events like art shows and the \"Red Bull Flugtag\" (German for \"flight day\" or \"flying day\").\n\nRed Bull owns football teams, with clubs in Austria, Germany, the United States, and Brazil featuring the Red Bull trademark in their names. By associating the drink's image with these activities, the company seeks to promote a \"cool\" public image and raise brand power. The energy drink has created a market for over 150 related types of products.\n\nIn the PlayStation 3's social gaming platform, PlayStation Home, Red Bull developed its own in-game island, specifically advertising its energy drink and the Red Bull Air Race event (for which the space is named) released in January 2009. In late November 2009, Red Bull produced two new spaces, the Red Bull Illume space, and the Red Bull Beach space featuring the Red Bull Flugtag, both released on the same day. In January 2012, Red Bull released its first personal space called the \"Red Bull House of Skate\" featuring an indoor skate park.\n\nOn the Apple App store Red Bull also has a few apps which include: RedBull.com, Red Bull TV, The Red Bulletin, RBMA Radio, Red Bull iFunk, Wings For Life- Selfie Run. As well as some games on the app store which are: Bike Unchained, Red Bull Kart Fighter 3, Red Bull Air Race The Game, Red Bull Racers.\n\nIn 2010, the company enlisted Adrian Newey to design a prototype racing car, the Red Bull X2010, for the videogame \"Gran Turismo 5\".\n\nThe Red Bull House of Art is an art fellowship program that was launched by Red Bull. The program is held in multiple cities, most notably the Red Bull House of Art programs in Detroit, Michigan and São Paulo, Brazil, and the program typically consists of a three-month period during which time six to eight participants will create new artwork with the intent to display it in a final exhibition. During the fellowship the artists receive unlimited access to the galleries and a stipend for art supplies.\n\nThe program has received criticism as being an \"elaborate advertising scheme\", as some of the artwork has been used in Red Bull advertising campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Red Bull added mainstream sport athletes to its roster of endorsements, which also includes persons involved in non-sporting activities.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61146", "title": "Chastity belt", "text": "Chastity belt\n\nA chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse or masturbation. Such belts were historically designed for women, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity, to protect women from rape or to dissuade women and their potential sexual partners from sexual temptation. Modern versions of the chastity belt are predominantly, but not exclusively, used in the BDSM community, and chastity belts are now designed for male wearers in addition to female wearers.\n\nAccording to modern myths, the chastity belt was used as an anti-temptation device during the Crusades. When the knight left for the Holy Lands on the Crusades, his Lady would wear a chastity belt to preserve her faithfulness to him. However, there is no credible evidence that chastity belts existed before the 15th century (over a century after the last Middle Eastern Crusade), and their main period of apparent use falls within the Renaissance rather than the Middle Ages. Research into the history of the chastity belt suggests that they were not used until the 16th century, and then only rather rarely; they first became widely available in the form of 19th-century anti-masturbation medical devices.\n\nRenaissance chastity belts were said to have had padded linings (to prevent large areas of metal from coming into direct prolonged contact with the skin), and these had to be changed fairly frequently, so that such belts were not practical for uninterrupted long-term wear. Uninterrupted long-term wear could have caused genitourinary infection, abrasive wounds, sepsis and eventual death.\n\nGregory the Great, Alcuin of York, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Nicholas Gorranus all made passing references to \"chastity belts\" within their exhortatory and public discourses, but meant this in a figurative or metaphorical sense within their historical context.\n\nThe first detailed actual mention of what could be interpreted as \"chastity belts\" in the West is in Konrad Kyeser von Eichstätt's \"Bellifortis\" (1405), which describes the military technology of the era. The book includes a drawing that is accompanied by the Latin text: \"Est florentinarum hoc bracile dominarum ferreum et durum ab antea sic reseratum.\" (\"These are hard iron breeches of Florentine women which are closed at the front.\") The belt in this drawing is described by Dingwall as \"both clumsy and heavy\", having \"little in common with the later models which served the same use\". The \"Bellifortis\" account is not supported by any additional concrete evidence or corroborating documents. Polidoro argues that Kyeser's references are meant to be humorous or ironic, and that Dingwall's accounts of the use of chastity belts by a few rich men in the 16th and 17th centuries to ensure the faithfulness of their often much younger wives should be treated critically, because of the absence of actual artefacts of this nature from the historical period in question, and his lack of access to more detailed contemporary historical records.\n\nIn 1889, a leather-and-iron belt was found by Anton Pachinger—a German collector of antiquities—in Linz, Austria, in a grave on a skeleton of a young woman. The woman was reportedly buried in the 16th century. Pachinger, however, could not find any record of the woman's burial in the town archives. The belt itself, along with most of the rest of Pachinger's collection, has been lost.\n\nTwo belts have been exhibited at the Musée de Cluny in Paris. The first, a simple velvet-covered hoop and plate of iron, was supposedly worn by Catherine de' Medici. The other—said to have been worn by Anne of Austria—is a hinged pair of plates held about the waist by metal straps, featuring intricately etched figures of Adam and Eve. There are other such belts at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg and the British Museum in London. Most have been removed from display to avoid any further embarrassment because the authenticity of these belts as medieval devices has since been called into question. Many contemporary historians accept that these alleged \"artifacts\" date from the 19th century, and are thus inauthentic.\n\nFrom the 18th century and until the 1930s, masturbation was widely regarded as harmful in Western medicine. Numerous mentions can be found in medical journals of the time of the use of chastity belt-like devices to prevent masturbation in female children and adolescents, as well as women. Many designs for anti-masturbation devices were filed in the US Patent Office until the early 1930s, when masturbation was deemed not to be the cause of mental health problems.\n\nFurthermore, some 19th-century working women may have used chastity belts for protective reasons, as a \"rape shield\" to obstruct sexual assault from predatory bosses or male colleagues; the belts were not worn for a long time uninterruptedly, however, since sanitary and hygiene reasons prevented this before the modern invention of stainless-steel belts.\n\nToday, chastity belts are sometimes used in BDSM play in consensual relationships. They are a means for the wearer to surrender control over their sexual behavior either for sexual play, or as a long-term method of preventing infidelity or masturbation. They range from simple leather or plastic toys commonly sold by adult stores to expensive high-security stainless steel devices made by a handful of specialist firms, including My-Steel, Neosteel, and Latowski in Germany, and Carrara Designs in Belgium. The internet has significantly increased the number of people using chastity devices, by making the purchase of a chastity device much easier while providing a private avenue for subcultures dedicated to their usage to thrive and connect with one another.\n\nDespite a historical association of chastity belts with women, worldwide purchasing demand for male chastity belts is reportedly far higher than purchasing demand for female chastity devices. As a consequence, the male chastity devices market offers more options and diversity compared to what is available for female chastity devices. Among male chastity devices, \"cock-and-ball\" trap devices are the most popular, followed by typically more secure full belt (around-the-waist) style devices.\n\nIn 1981, while California State Senator John G. Schmitz was leading hearings on outlawing abortion, Gloria Allred presented him with a chastity belt. Schmitz retaliated in a press release, calling her a \"slick butch lawyeress.\" She sued him for libel, and eventually secured a settlement of $20,000 and an apology.\n\nIn 1998, racial riots against the ethnic Chinese in West Java prompted the production and sale of \"anti-rape corsets\". These were Florentine-type belts of imitation leather-covered plastic, fastened with a combination lock. The belts had a solid crotch strap without holes, and were intended only for brief outings.\n\nIn April 2002, the Uwe Koetter Jewellers company of Cape Town, South Africa, completed and delivered a diamond and pearl-encrusted chastity belt made of gold to a British customer. The belt reportedly cost R160,000 and was a wedding gift from a husband-to-be for his bride to wear at their wedding.\n\nOn February 6, 2004, \"USA Today\" reported that at Athens airport in Greece, a woman's steel chastity belt had triggered a security alarm at the metal detector. The woman explained that her husband had forced her to wear the device to prevent an extramarital affair while she was on vacation in Greece. She was allowed to continue her flight to London on the pilot's authority. The incident was said to have happened just before Christmas in 2003.\n\nIn November 2006, photographs of Lucio Valentini's hand-wrought iron chastity belts were published in newspapers including the Seoul Times, and CRI Online. Although Valentini's company, MedioEvo, claims that their chastity belts' designs are from the Middle Ages on their website, a company spokesperson acknowledged that there is no proof that devices such as these were actually used.\n\nIn 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission reported that women were being forced to wear chastity belts in the Indian state of Rajasthan.\n\nIn 2008, masseuses in Batu, Indonesia were required to wear belts with a lock and key during working hours, to prevent prostitution.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, AOL News reported that Dexter Blanch, a dog breeder from Louisiana, introduced a chastity belt for dogs, called PABS (Pet Anti-Breeding System). It is made of polypropylene and uses an eight-buckle locking system and a washable mesh pad to prevent intercourse in female dogs. Dr. Kathleen Makolinski, director of veterinary outreach at the ASPCA, commented that \"For the majority of animals, spaying and neutering remains the most beneficial option\". While this may be true for dogs being helped by rescues and humane societies, the American Kennel Club subsequently changed its policy regarding pediatric spaying or neutering. Following the research published by UC Davis, the American Kennel Club (AKC) now says that the owner of large breed dogs will have a healthier, longer lived dog if the pet owner would wait until the dog is of appropriate age before spaying or neutering.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, \"China People's Daily\" reported that a man in his 50s, naked except for a homemade chastity belt, appeared with a pair of banners in Changchun World Sculpture Park in Jilin province in China, seeking a wife. He stated that he wore the chastity belt to symbolize fidelity to his future wife.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61230", "title": "Candy", "text": "Candy\n\nCandy, also called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called \"sugar confectionery\", encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be \"candied\".\n\nPhysically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.\n\nBetween the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, the Persians, followed by the Greeks, discovered the people in India and their \"reeds that produce honey without bees\". They adopted and then spread sugar and sugarcane agriculture. Sugarcane is indigenous to tropical South and Southeast Asia, while the word sugar is derived from the Sanskrit word \"Sharkara\". Pieces of sugar were produced by boiling sugarcane juice in ancient India and consumed as \"Khanda\", dubbed as the original candy and the etymology of the word.\n\nBefore sugar was readily available, candy was based on honey. Honey was used in Ancient China, Middle East, Egypt, Greece and the Roman Empire to coat fruits and flowers to preserve them or to create forms of candy. Candy is still served in this form today, though now it is more typically seen as a type of garnish.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, candy was often considered a form of medicine, either used to calm the digestive system or cool a sore throat. In the Middle Ages candy appeared on the tables of only the most wealthy at first. At that time, it began as a combination of spices and sugar that was used as an aid to digestive problems. Digestive problems were very common during this time due to the constant consumption of food that was neither fresh nor well balanced. Banquet hosts would typically serve these types of 'candies' at banquets for their guests. One of these candies, sometimes called \"chamber spice\", was made with cloves, ginger, aniseed, juniper berries, almonds and pine kernels dipped in melted sugar.\n\nThe Middle English word \"candy\" began to be used in the late 13th century.\n\nThe first candy came to America in the early 18th century from Britain and France. Only a few of the early colonists were proficient in sugar work and were able to provide the sugary treats for the very wealthy. Rock candy, made from crystallized sugar, was the simplest form of candy, but even this basic form of sugar was considered a luxury and was only attainable by the rich.\n\nThe candy business underwent a drastic change in the 1830s when technological advances and the availability of sugar opened up the market. The new market was not only for the enjoyment of the rich but also for the pleasure of the working class. There was also an increasing market for children. While some fine confectioners remained, the candy store became a staple of the child of the American working class. Penny candies epitomized this transformation of candy. Penny candy became the first material good that children spent their own money on. For this reason, candy store-owners relied almost entirely on the business of children to keep them running. Even penny candies were directly descended from medicated lozenges that held bitter medicine in a hard sugar coating.\n\nIn 1847, the invention of the candy press (also known as a toy machine) made it possible to produce multiple shapes and sizes of candy at once. In 1851, confectioners began to use a revolving steam pan to assist in boiling sugar. This transformation meant that the candy maker was no longer required to continuously stir the boiling sugar. The heat from the surface of the pan was also much more evenly distributed and made it less likely the sugar would burn. These innovations made it possible for only one or two people to successfully run a candy business.\nAs the path from producer to market became increasingly complicated, many foods were affected by adulteration and the addition of additives which ranged from relatively harmless ingredients, such as cheap cornstarch and corn syrup, to poisonous ones. Some manufacturers produced bright colors in candy by the addition of hazardous substances for which there was no legal regulation: green (chromium oxide and copper acetate), red (lead oxide and mercury sulfide), yellow (lead chromate) and white (chalk, arsenic trioxide).\n\nIn an 1885 cover cartoon for \"Puck\", Joseph Keppler satirized the dangers of additives in candy by depicting the \"mutual friendship\" between striped candy, doctors, and gravediggers. By 1906, research into the dangers of additives, exposés of the food industry, and public pressure led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, the first federal United States law to regulate food and drugs, including candy.\n\nSugar candies include hard candies, soft candies, caramels, marshmallows, taffy, and other candies whose principal ingredient is sugar. Commercially, sugar candies are often divided into groups according to the amount of sugar they contain and their chemical structure.\n\nChocolate is sometimes treated as a separate branch of confectionery. In this model, chocolate candies like chocolate candy bars and chocolate truffles are included. Hot chocolate or other cocoa-based drinks are excluded, as is candy made from white chocolate. However, when chocolate is treated as a separate branch, it also includes confections whose classification is otherwise difficult, being neither exactly candies nor exactly baked goods, like chocolate-dipped foods, tarts with chocolate shells, and chocolate-coated cookies.\n\nSugar candies can be classified into noncrystalline and crystalline types. Noncrystalline candies are homogeneous and may be chewy or hard; they include hard candies, caramels, toffees, and nougats. Crystalline candies incorporate small crystals in their structure, are creamy that melt in the mouth or are easily chewed; they include fondant and fudge.\n\nSugar candy is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a syrup, which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to caramelize. Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle. The texture of candy depends on the ingredients and the temperatures that the candy is processed at.\n\nThe final texture of sugar candy depends primarily on the sugar concentration. As the syrup is heated, it boils, water evaporates, the sugar concentration increases and the boiling point rises. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration. These are called sugar stages. In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies. Once the syrup reaches or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an amber-colored substance known as caramel. This should not be confused with caramel candy, although it is the candy's main flavoring.\n\nMost candies are made commercially. The industry relies significantly on trade secret protection, because candy recipes cannot be copyrighted or patented effectively, but are very difficult to duplicate exactly. Seemingly minor differences in the machinery, temperature, or timing of the candy-making process can cause noticeable differences in the final product.\n\n\"Candy wrapper\" or \"sweets wrapper\" is a common term for this packaging.\n\nPackaging preserves aroma and flavor and eases shipping and dispensation. Wax paper seals against air, moisture, dust, and germs, while cellophane is valued by packagers for its transparency and resistance to grease, odors and moisture. In addition, it is often resealable. Polyethylene is another form of film sealed with heat, and this material is often used to make bags in bulk packaging. Plastic wraps are also common. Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. Cardboard cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.\n\nPackages are often sealed with a starch-based adhesive derived from tapioca, potato, wheat, sago, or sweet potato. Occasionally, glues are made from the bones and skin of cattle and hogs for a stronger and more flexible product, but this is not as common because of the expense.\n\nPrior to the 1900s, candy was commonly sold unwrapped from carts in the street, where it was exposed to dirt and insects. By 1914, there were some machines to wrap gum and stick candies, but this was not the common practice. After the polio outbreak in 1916, unwrapped candies garnered widespread censure because of the dirt and germs. At the time, only upscale candy stores used glass jars. With advancements in technology, wax paper was adopted, and foil and cellophane were imported to the U.S. from France by DuPont in 1925. Necco packagers were one of the first companies to package without human touch.\n\nCandy packaging played a role in its adoption as the most popular treat given away during trick-or-treating for Halloween in the US. In the 1940s, most treats were homemade. During the 1950s, small, individually wrapped candies were recognized as convenient and inexpensive. By the 1970s, after widely publicized but largely false stories of poisoned candy myths circulating in the popular press, factory-sealed packaging with a recognizable name brand on it became a sign of safety.\n\nPackaging helps market the product as well. Manufacturers know that candy must be hygienic and attractive to customers. In the children's market quantity, novelty, large size and bright colors are the top sellers. Many companies redesign the packaging to maintain consumer appeal.\n\nBecause of its high sugar concentration, bacteria are not usually able to grow in candy. As a result, the shelf life is longer for candy than for many other foods. Most candies can be safely stored in their original packaging at room temperature in a dry, dark cupboard for months or years. As a rule, the softer the candy or the damper the storage area, the sooner it goes stale.\n\nShelf life considerations with most candies are focused on appearance, taste, and texture, rather than about the potential for food poisoning; that is, old candy may not look appealing or taste very good, even though it is very unlikely to make the eater sick. Candy can be made unsafe by storing it badly, such as in a wet, moldy area. Typical recommendations are these:\n\nMost sugar candies are defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.\n\nEven in a culture that eats sweets frequently, candy is not a significant source of nutrition or food energy for most people. The average American eats about 1.1 kg (2.5 pounds) of sugar or similar sweeteners each week, but almost 95% of that sugar—all but about 70 grams (2.5 ounces)—comes from non-candy sources, especially soft drinks and processed foods.\n\nCandy is considered a source of empty calories, because it provides little or no nutritional value beyond food energy. At the start of the 20th century, when undernutrition was a serious problem, especially among poor and working-class people, and when nutrition science was a new field, the high calorie content was promoted as a virtue. Researchers suggested that candy, especially candy made with milk and nuts, was a low-cost alternative to normal meals. To get the food energy necessary for a day of labor, candy might cost half as much as eggs. During the 1920s and 1930s, candy bars selling for five cents were often marketed as replacements for lunch.\n\nAt the 1904 World Fair, the Quaker Oats Company made a candy-coated puffed cereal, a wheat-based product similar to Cracker Jack's candy-coated popcorn. The product concept was re-introduced unsuccessfully in 1939 by another business as Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened, candy-coated breakfast cereal. Post Foods introduced their own version in 1948, originally called Happy Jax and later Sugar Crisp. They marketed it as both a replacement for unsweetened breakfast cereals and also for eating as a snack or as candy, using three animated cartoon bears as the mascots: Candy, Handy, and Dandy. The early slogans said, \"As a cereal it's dandy—for snacks it's so handy—or eat it like candy!\"\n\nIn more recent times, a variety of snack bars have been marketed. These include bars that are intended as meal replacements as well as snack bars that are marketed as having nutritional advantages when compared to candy bars, such as granola bars. However, the actual nutritional value is often not very different from candy bars, except for usually a higher sodium content, and the flavors (most popularly, chocolate, fudge, and caramel) and the presentation mimic candy bars.\n\nAmong the Bengali people, candy may be eaten for an entire meal, especially during festivals. Candy may also be offered to vegetarian guests in lieu of fish or meat dishes in India.\n\nMost candy contains no meat or other animal parts, and many contain no milk or other animal products. Some candy, including marshmallows and gummi bears, contains gelatin derived from animal collagen, a protein found in skin and bones, and is thus avoided by vegans and some vegetarians. \"Kosher gelatin\" is also unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans, as it is derived from fish bones. Other substances, such as agar, pectin, starch and gum arabic may also be used as setting and gelling agents, and can be used in place of gelatin.\n\nOther ingredients commonly found in candy that are not suitable for vegetarian or vegan diets include carmine, a red dye made from cochineal beetles, and confectioner's glaze, which contains shellac, a resin excreted by female lac bugs.\n\nCandy generally contains sugar, which is a key environmental factor in the formation of dental caries (cavities). Several types of bacteria commonly found in the mouth consume sugar, particularly \"Streptococcus mutans\". When these bacteria metabolize the sugar found in most candies, juice, or other sugary foods, they produce acids in the mouth that demineralize the tooth enamel and can lead to dental caries. Heavy or frequent consumption of high-sugar foods, especially lollipops, sugary cough drops, and other sugar-based candies that stay in the mouth for a long time, increases the risk of tooth decay. Candies that also contain enamel-dissolving acids, such as acid drops, increase the risk. Cleaning the teeth and mouth shortly after eating any type of sugary food, and allowing several hours to pass between eating such foods, reduces the risk and improves oral health.\n\nHowever, frequent consumption of fruits and fruit juice, which contain both acid and sugars, may be a more significant factor in dental decay than candies.\n\nMost candy, particularly low-fat and fat-free candy, has a high glycemic index (GI), which means that it causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels after ingestion. This is chiefly a concern for people with diabetes, but could also be dangerous to the health of non-diabetics.\n\nSome kinds of candy have been contaminated with an excessive amount of lead in it. Claims of contamination have been made since shortly after industrial-scale candy factories began producing candy in the mid-19th century, although these early claims were rarely true.\n\nHard, round candies are a leading cause of choking deaths in children. Some types of candy, such as Lychee Mini Fruity Gels, have been associated with so many choking deaths that their import or manufacture is banned by some countries.\n\nNon-nutritive toy products such as chocolate eggs containing packaging with a toy inside are banned from sale in the US. If the material attached to confectionery has a function and will not cause any injury to the consumer, it is allowed to be marketed. In the EU, however, the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC specifies that toys contained in food only need separate packaging that cannot be swallowed.\n\nGlobal sales of candies were estimated to have been approximately US $118 billion in 2012.\n\nBecause each culture varies in how it treats some foods, a food may be a candy in one place and a dessert in another. For example, in Western countries, baklava is served on a plate and eaten with a fork as a dessert, but in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Eastern Europe, it is treated as a candy.\n\nCandy is the source of several cultural themes:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61398", "title": "Superpower", "text": "Superpower\n\nA superpower is a state with a dominant position characterised by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale. This is done through the combined-means of economic, military, technological, and cultural strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence. Traditionally, superpowers are preeminent among the great powers.\n\nThe term was first applied post World War II to the United States and the Soviet Union. For the duration of the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union came to be generally regarded as the two remaining superpowers, dominating world affairs. At the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, only the United States appeared to be the world's superpower.\n\nRecently in 2018, there has been growing consensus among academics that China has reached superpower status, with some arguing that China's growing influence in Africa, Southeast Asia, Central Asia and Latin America along with China-led multilateral organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Belt and Road Initiative, BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, is now being seen as a direct counter against US influence. The competition of global influence has led some to believe that the world is reverting back to the bipolarity seen during the Cold War. Although such bipolar divisions is less overt and confrontational than the division seen during the original Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States; it is important to realize that the competition between the two superpowers along with Russia's growing involvement in international affairs is changing the geopolitical landscape in the 21st century to what some may call as the Second Cold War.\n\nAlice Lyman Miller defines a superpower as \"a country that has the capacity to project dominating power and influence anywhere in the world, and sometimes, in more than one region of the globe at a time, and so may plausibly attain the status of global hegemony.\"\n\nNo agreed definition of what is a 'superpower' exists, and may differ between sources. However, a fundamental characteristic that is consistent with all definitions of a superpower is a nation or state that has mastered the seven dimensions of state power: geography, population, economy, resources, military, diplomacy and national identity.\n\nThe term was first used to describe nations with greater than great power status as early as 1944, but only gained its specific meaning with regard to the United States and the Soviet Union after World War II. This was because the United States and the Soviet Union had proved themselves to be capable of casting great influence in global politics and military dominance. The term in its current political meaning was coined by Dutch-American geostrategist Nicholas Spykman in a series of lectures in 1943 about the potential shape of a new post-war world order. This formed the foundation for the book \"The Geography of the Peace\", which referred primarily to the unmatched maritime global supremacy of the British Empire and United States as essential for peace and prosperity in the world.\n\nA year later, in 1944, William T. R. Fox, an American foreign policy professor, elaborated on the concept in the book \"The Superpowers: The United States, Britain and the Soviet Union — Their Responsibility for Peace\", which spoke of the global reach of a super-empowered nation. Fox used the word Superpower to identify a new category of power able to occupy the highest status in a world in which, as the war then raging demonstrated, states could challenge and fight each other on a global scale. According to him, there were (at that moment) three states that were superpowers: the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Empire was the most extensive empire in world history and considered the foremost great power, holding sway over 25% of the world's population and controlling about 25% of the Earth's total land area, while the United States and the Soviet Union grew in power before and during World War II.\n\nAccording to Lyman Miller, \"The basic components of superpower stature may be measured along four axes of power: military, economic, political, and cultural (or what political scientist Joseph Nye has termed “soft power”)\".\n\nIn the opinion of Kim Richard Nossal of Queen's University in Canada, \"generally this term was used to signify a political community that occupied a continental-sized landmass, had a sizable population (relative at least to other major powers); a superordinate economic capacity, including ample indigenous supplies of food and natural resources; enjoyed a high degree of non-dependence on international intercourse; and, most importantly, had a well-developed nuclear capacity (eventually normally defined as second strike capability).\"\n\nIn the opinion of Professor Paul Dukes, \"a superpower must be able to conduct a global strategy including the possibility of destroying the world; to command vast economic potential and influence; and to present a universal ideology\". Although, \"many modifications may be made to this basic definition\". According to Professor June Teufel Dreyer, \"A superpower must be able to project its power, soft and hard, globally.\" In his book, \"\", Dr. Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, argues that a superpower is \"a country that can exert enough military, political, and economic power to persuade nations in every region of the world to take important actions they would not otherwise take.\"\n\nThere have been many attempts by historians to apply the term superpower retrospectively, and sometimes very loosely, to a variety of entities in the past. Recognition by historians of these older states as superpowers may focus on various superlative traits exhibited by them. Examples of these ancient or historical superpowers include the British Empire, Ancient Egypt, the Hittite Empire, the Median Empire, the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire, the Sassanian Empire, the Safavid Empire, the Afsharid Empire, the Hellenistic Empire of Alexander the Great, the Roman Empire, the Maurya Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Russian Empire, the Han Empire, the Tang Empire, the Rashidun Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Mongol Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Timurid Empire of Timur the Great, the First French Empire of Napoleon, Song dynasty, Ming dynasty, Qing dynasty, Gupta Empire, Chola dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate, Rashtrakuta dynasty, the Mughal Empire, Carthaginian Empire, Aksumite Empire, Almoravid Empire, Mali Empire, Inca Empire, Carolingian Empire and the Portuguese Empire. \n\nAccording to historical statistics and research from the OECD, until the early modern period, Western Europe, China, and India accounted for roughly of the world's GDP.\n\nThe 1956 Suez Crisis suggested that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue its foreign policy objectives on an equal footing with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world ought to look like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.\n\nThe two countries opposed each other ideologically, politically, militarily, and economically. The Soviet Union promoted the ideology of communism: planned economy and a one-party state, whilst the United States promoted the ideologies of liberal democracy and the free market. This was reflected in the Warsaw Pact and NATO military alliances, respectively, as most of Europe became aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. These alliances implied that these two nations were part of an emerging bipolar world, in contrast with a previously multipolar world. \n\nThe idea that the Cold War period revolved around only two blocs, or even only two nations, has been challenged by some scholars in the post–Cold War era, who have noted that the bipolar world only exists if one ignores all of the various movements and conflicts that occurred without influence from either of the two superpowers. Additionally, much of the conflict between the superpowers was fought in \"proxy wars\", which more often than not involved issues more complex than the standard Cold War oppositions.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s, the term hyperpower began to be applied to the United States, as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era. This term, popularized by French foreign minister Hubert Védrine in the late 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory, Samuel P. Huntington, rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar balance of power. Other international relations theorists, such as Henry Kissinger, theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Western Europe and Japan, American influence is only declining since the end of the Cold War, because such regions no longer need protection or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.\n\nThe Soviet Union and the United States fulfilled the superpower criteria in the following ways:\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 which ended the Cold War, the post–Cold War world has in the past been considered by some to be a unipolar world, with the United States as the world's sole remaining superpower. In 1999, Samuel P. Huntington wrote, \"The United States, of course, is the sole state with preeminence in every domain of power – economic, military, diplomatic, ideological, technological, and cultural – with the reach and capabilities to promote its interests in virtually every part of the world.\" However, he rejected the claim that the world was unipolar: \"There is now only one superpower. But that does not mean that the world is unipolar,\" describing it instead as \"a strange hybrid, a uni-multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers.\" He further wrote that \"Washington is blind to the fact that it no longer enjoys the dominance it had at the end of the Cold War. It must relearn the game of international politics as a major power, not a superpower, and make compromises.\"\n\nExperts argue that this older assessment of global politics is too simplified, in part because of the difficulty in classifying the European Union at its current stage of development. Others argue that the notion of a superpower is outdated, considering complex global economic interdependencies, and propose that the world is multipolar.\n\nA 2012 report by the National Intelligence Council said that America's superpower status will have eroded to merely being first among equals by 2030, but that the US would remain highest among the world's most powerful countries because of its influence in many different fields and global connections that the great regional powers of the time would not match. Additionally, some experts have suggested the possibility of the United States losing its superpower status completely in the future. Citing speculation of the United States relative decline in power to the rest of the world, economic hardships, a declining dollar, Cold War allies becoming less dependent on the United States and the emergence of future powers around the world.\n\nSome people doubt the existence of superpowers in the post–Cold War era altogether, stating that today's complex global marketplace and the rising interdependency between the world's nations has made the concept of a superpower an idea of the past and that the world is now multipolar. However, while the military dominance of the United States remains unquestioned for now and its international influence has made it an eminent world power, countries such as China, India, Brazil and Russia are inventing new ways to counter US military supremacy (namely space) and are making great strides in science, literature, soft power, and diplomacy.\n\nThe term 'potential superpowers' has been applied by scholars and other qualified commentators to the possibility of several states achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Due to their large markets, growing military strength, economic potential, and influence in international affairs, China, the European Union, India, and Russia are among the political entities most cited as having the potential of achieving superpower status in the 21st century. Many historians, writers, and critics have expressed doubts, however, whether any of these countries would ever emerge as a new superpower. Some political scientists and other commentators have even suggested that such countries might simply be emerging powers, as opposed to potential superpowers.\n\nBesides those mentioned above, a limited number of observers have also discussed, though ultimately dismissed, Brazil having the potential to emerge as a superpower.\n\nThe record of such predictions has admittedly not been perfect. For example, in the 1980s, some commentators thought Japan would become a superpower, due to its large GDP and high economic growth at the time. However, Japan's economy crashed in 1991, creating a long period of economic slump in the country which has become known as \"The Lost Years\". As of August 2012, Japan had yet to fully recover from the 1991 crash.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61933", "title": "Mayonnaise", "text": "Mayonnaise\n\nMayonnaise (, , also ), informally mayo (), is a thick cold sauce or dressing usually used in sandwiches and composed salads. It is a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and acid, either vinegar or lemon juice. There are many variants using additional flavorings. The proteins and lecithin in the egg yolk serve as emulsifiers in mayonnaise (and hollandaise sauce). The color of mayonnaise varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel.\n\nCommercial egg-free varieties are made for vegans and others who avoid chicken eggs or dietary cholesterol.\n\nA \"mayonnaise de poulet\" is mentioned by a traveler to Paris in 1804, but not described. Viard's 1806 recipe for \"poulets en mayonnaise\" describes a sauce involving a velouté, gelatin, vinegar, and an optional egg to thicken it, which gels like an aspic. Grimod de La Reynière's 1808 \"bayonnaise\" sauce is also a sort of aspic: \"But if one wants to make from this cold chicken, a dish of distinction, one composes a bayonnaise, whose green jelly, of a good consistency, forms the most worthy ornament of poultry and fish salads.\" The word is attested in English in 1815.\n\nMayonnaise may have existed long before: \"It is highly probable that wherever olive oil existed, a simple preparation of oil and egg came about — particularly in the Mediterranean region, where \"aioli\" (oil and garlic) is made.\"\n\nThe origin of the name is unclear.\n\nA common theory is that it is named for Port Mahon in Menorca, in honor of the 3rd Duke of Richelieu's victory over the British in 1756, and in fact the name \"mahonnaise\" is used by some authors. But the name is only attested long after that event. One version of this theory says that it was originally known as \"salsa mahonesa\" in Spanish, but that spelling is only attested later.\n\nGrimod de La Reynière rejected the name \"mayonnaise\" because the word \"is not French\"; he rejected \"mahonnaise\" because Port Mahon \"is not known for good food\", and thus he preferred \"bayonnaise\", after the city of Bayonne, which \"has many innovative gourmands and ... produces the best hams in Europe.\n\nCarême preferred the spelling \"magnonnaise\", which he derived from the French verb \"manier\" 'to handle'.\n\nAnother suggestion is it derives from Charles de Lorraine, duke of Mayenne, because he took the time to finish his meal of chicken with cold sauce before being defeated in the Battle of Arques.\n\nRecipes for mayonnaise date back to the early nineteenth century. In 1815, Louis Eustache Ude wrote:\n\nNo 58.—Mayonnaise. Take three spoonfuls of Allemande, six ditto of aspic, and two of oil. Add a little tarragon vinegar, that has not boiled, some pepper and salt, and minced ravigotte, or merely some parsley. Then put in the members of fowl, or fillets of soles, &c. Your mayonnaise must be put to ice; neither are you to put the members into your sauce till it begins to freeze. Next dish your meat or fish, mask with the sauce before it be quite frozen, and garnish your dish with whatever you think proper, as beet root, jelly, nasturtiums, &c.\n\nIn an 1820 work, Viard describes something like the more familiar emulsified version:\nThis sauce is made to \"take\" in many ways: with raw egg yolks, with gelatine, with veal or veal brain glaze. The most common method is to take a raw egg yolk in a small terrine, with a little salt and lemon juice: take a wooden spoon, turn it while letting a trickle of oil fall and stirring constantly; as your sauce thickens, add a little vinegar; put in too a pound of good oil: serve your sauce with good salt: serve it white or green, adding green of ravigote or green of spinach. This sauce is used for cold fish entrees, or salad of vegetables cooked in salt water.\n\nModern mayonnaise can be made by hand with a whisk, a fork, or with the aid of an electric mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.\n\nFor large-scale preparation of mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically begins with the dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once emulsified, the remaining ingredients are then added and vigorously mixed until completely hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly as it can be absorbed. Though only a small part of the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small liquid volume, which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. Though, as technology in the food industry advances, processing has been shortened drastically, allowing roughly 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.\n\nEgg-free varieties of mayonnaise are available for vegans and others who want to avoid eggs, animal fat, and cholesterol, or who have egg allergies. In the U.S., these alternatives cannot be labelled as \"mayonnaise\" because of the FDA's definition of mayonnaise making egg a requirement. Egg-free varieties generally contain soya or pea protein as the emulsifying agent to stabilize oil droplets in water. Well-known brands include Nasoya's Nayonaise, Vegenaise and Just Mayo in North America, and Plamil Egg Free in the UK.\n\nMayonnaise is used commonly around the world, and is also a base for many other chilled sauces and salad dressings. For example, \"sauce rémoulade\", in classic French cuisine, is mayonnaise to which has been added mustard, gherkins, capers, parsley, chervil, tarragon, and possibly anchovy essence.\n\nChile is the world's third major per capita consumer of mayonnaise and first in Latin America. Commercial mayonnaise became widely accessible in the 1980s.\n\nGuidelines issued in September 1991 by Europe's Federation of the Condiment Sauce Industries recommend that oil and liquid egg yolk levels in mayonnaise should be at least 70% and 5%, respectively. The Netherlands incorporated this guideline in 1998 into the law \"Warenwetbesluit Gereserveerde aanduidingen\" in article 4. Most available brands easily exceed this target. In countries influenced by French culture, mustard is also a common ingredient, but the addition of mustard turns the sauce into a remoulade with a different flavor and the mustard acts as an additional emulsifier.\n\nJapanese mayonnaise is typically made with apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar and a small amount of MSG, which gives it a different flavor from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as \"okonomiyaki, takoyaki\" and \"yakisoba\" and may also accompany \"katsu\" and \"karaage\". It is most often sold in soft plastic squeeze bottles. Its texture is thicker than most Western commercial mayonnaise in part because only egg yolks and not the entire egg is used when making it. Kewpie (Q.P.) is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, advertised with a Kewpie doll logo. The vinegar is a proprietary blend containing apple and malt vinegars. The Kewpie company was started in 1925 by Tochiro Nakashima, whose goal was to create a condiment that made eating vegetables more enjoyable.\n\nMayonnaise is very popular in Russia, where it is made with sunflower oil and soybean oil. A 2004 study showed that Russia is the only market in Europe where mayonnaise is sold more than ketchup by volume. It is used as a sauce in the most popular salads in Russia, such as Olivier salad (also known as Russian salad), dressed herring, and many others. Leading brands are Calvé (marketed by Unilever) and Sloboda (marketed by Efko).\n\nCommercial mayonnaise sold in jars originated in Philadelphia in 1907 when Amelia Schlorer decided to start selling her own mayonnaise recipe originally used in salads sold in the family grocery store. Mrs. Schlorer's mayonnaise was an instant success with local customers and eventually grew into the Schlorer Delicatessen Company. Around the same time in New York City, a family from Vetschau, Germany, at Richard Hellmann's delicatessen on Columbus Avenue, featured his wife's homemade recipe in salads sold in their delicatessen. The condiment quickly became so popular that Hellmann began selling it in \"wooden boats\" that were used for weighing butter. In 1912, Mrs. Hellmann's mayonnaise was mass-marketed and later was trademarked in 1926 as Hellmann's Blue Ribbon Mayonnaise. In the United States, mayonnaise sales are about $1.3 billion per year.\n\nA typical formulation for commercially made mayonnaise (not low fat) can contain as much as 80% vegetable oil, usually soybean but sometimes olive oil. Water makes up about 7% to 8% and egg yolks about 6%. Some formulas use whole eggs instead of just yolks. The remaining ingredients include vinegar (4%), salt (1%), and sugar (1%). Low-fat formulas will typically decrease oil content to just 50% and increase water content to about 35%. Egg content is reduced to 4% and vinegar to 3%. Sugar is increased to 1.5% and salt lowered to 0.7%. Gums or thickeners (4%) are added to increase viscosity, improve texture, and ensure a stable emulsion. Mayonnaise is prepared using several methods, but on average it contains around per 100 grams, or 94 kilocalories (Cal) per tablespoon. This makes mayonnaise a calorically dense food.\n\nThe nutrient content of mayonnaise (> 50% edible oil, 9–11% salt, 7–10% sugar in the aqueous phase) makes it suitable as a food source for many spoilage organisms. A set of conditions such as pH between 3.6 and 4.0, and low water activity \"a\" of 0.925, restricts the growth of yeasts, a few bacteria and molds. Yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces, \"Lactobacillus fructivorans,\" and \"Zygosaccharomyces bailii\" are the species responsible for the spoilage of mayonnaise. The characteristics of spoilage caused by \"Z. bailli\" are product separation and a \"yeasty\" odor. A study suggests that adding encapsulated cells of \"Bifidobacterium bifidum\" and \"B. infantis\" prolongs the life of mayonnaise up to 12 weeks without microorganism spoilage.\n\nMayonnaise, both commercially processed and home-made, has been associated with illnesses from \"Salmonella\" globally. The source of the \"Salmonella\" has been confirmed to be raw eggs. Several outbreaks with fatal cases have been recorded, with a few major incidents. In a 1955 outbreak in Denmark, 10,000 people were affected by \"Salmonella\" from contaminated mayonnaise made by a large kitchen. The pH of the mayonnaise was found to be 5.1, with \"Salmonella\" counts of 180,000 CFU/g. The second outbreak, also in Denmark, caused 41 infections with two fatalities. The pH of the contaminated mayonnaise was 6.0, with \"Salmonella\" counts of 6 million CFU/g. In 1976 there were serious salmonellosis outbreaks on four flights to and from Spain which caused 500 cases and 6 fatalities. In the US, 404 people became ill and nine died in a New York City hospital due to hospital-prepared mayonnaise. In all salmonellosis cases, the major reason was improper acidification of the mayonnaise, with a pH higher than the recommended upper limit of 4.1, with acetic acid as the main acidifying agent.\n\n"}

Most sauces are not normally consumed by themselves; they add flavor, moisture, and visual appeal to a dish. \"Sauce\" is a French word taken from the Latin \"salsa\", meaning \"salted\". Possibly the oldest recorded European sauce is garum, the fish sauce used by the Ancient Greeks; while doubanjiang, the Chinese soy bean paste is mentioned in \"Rites of Zhou\" in the 3rd century BC.\n\nSauces need a liquid component. Sauces are an essential element in cuisines all over the world.\n\nSauces may be used for sweet or savory dishes. They may be prepared and served cold, like mayonnaise, prepared cold but served lukewarm like pesto, cooked and served warm like bechamel or cooked and served cold like apple sauce. They may be freshly prepared by the cook, especially in restaurants, but today many sauces are sold premade and packaged like Worcestershire sauce, HP Sauce, soy sauce or ketchup. Sauces for salad are called salad dressing. Sauces made by deglazing a pan are called pan sauces.\n\nA chef who specializes in making sauces is called a saucier.\n\n\nIn traditional British cuisine, gravy is a sauce used on roast dinner. The sole survivor of the medieval bread-thickened sauces, bread sauce is one of the oldest sauces in British cooking. Apple sauce, mint sauce and horseradish sauce are used on meat (usually on pork, lamb and beef respectively). Redcurrant jelly, mint jelly, and white sauce may also be used. Salad cream is sometimes used on salads. Ketchup and brown sauce are used on fast-food type dishes. Strong English mustard is also used on various foods, as is Worcestershire sauce. Custard is a popular dessert sauce. Other popular sauces include mushroom sauce, marie rose sauce (as used in a prawn cocktail), whisky sauce (for serving with haggis), Albert sauce (horseradish sauce to enhance flavour of braised beef) and cheddar sauce (as used in cauliflower or macaroni and cheese). In contemporary British cuisine, owing to the wide diversity of British society today, there are also many sauces that are of British origin but based upon the cuisine of other countries, particularly former colonies such as India.\n\nSauces in French cuisine date back to the Middle Ages. There were many hundreds of sauces in the culinary repertoire. In \"cuisine classique\" (roughly from the end of the 19th century until the advent of \"nouvelle cuisine\" in the 1980s), sauces were a major defining characteristic of French cuisine.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the chef Marie-Antoine Carême created an extensive list of sauces, many of which were original recipes. It is unknown how many sauces Carême is responsible for, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds. The cream sauce, in its most popular form around the world, was concurrently created by another chef, Dennis Leblanc, working in the same kitchen as Carême. Carême considered the four \"grandes sauces\" to be espagnole, velouté, allemande, and béchamel, from which a large variety of petites sauces could be composed.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the chef Auguste Escoffier refined Carême's list of basic sauces in the four editions of his classic \"Le Guide Culinaire\" and its abridged English translation \"A Guide to Modern Cookery\". He dropped allemande as he considered it a variation of velouté, and added hollandaise and \"sauce tomate\", defining the five fundamental \"mother sauces\" still used today:\nA sauce which is derived from one of the mother sauces by augmenting with additional ingredients is sometimes called a \"daughter sauce\" or \"secondary sauce\". Most sauces commonly used in classical cuisine are daughter sauces. For example, béchamel can be made into Mornay by the addition of grated cheese, and espagnole becomes bordelaise with the addition of reduction of red wine, shallots, and poached beef marrow.\n\nA specialized implement, the French sauce spoon, was introduced in the mid-20th century to aid in eating sauce in French cuisine, enjoying increasing popularity at high-end restaurants.\n\nItalian sauces reflect the rich variety of the Italian cuisine and can be divided in several categories including:\n\nExamples are:\n\nThere are thousands of such sauces, and many towns have traditional sauces. Among the internationally well-known are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61945", "title": "Beefsteak", "text": "Beefsteak\n\nA beef steak is a flat cut of beef, with parallel faces spaced to a thickness of 0.5–2 in (1–5 cm), usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers, with a raw mass in common restaurant service ranging from 4–20 oz (120–600 g). Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan fried, or broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (\"cf.\" cube steak).\n\nIn Australia, beef steak is referred to as just 'steak' and can be purchased uncooked in supermarkets, butchers, and some smallgood shops. It is sold cooked as a meal in almost every pub, bistro, or restaurant specialising in modern Australian food, and is ranked based on the quality and the cut. Most venues usually have five to seven different cuts of steak on their menu and serve it medium rare by default. A steak is normally accompanied by a choice of sauces and a choice of either chips (thick french fries) or jacket potato. A complementary choice of side salad or steamed vegetables is also commonly offered.\n\nIn the Balkan region, steak is often rubbed with mustard and pepper, and marinated in vinegar and vegetable oil for up to a week. It is then fried in butter, and a slice of toast is then used to soak up the pan drippings. The steak is served on the toast and topped with optional fried egg and a sprig of parsley.\n\nIn France, steak is usually served with French fries or \"pommes frites\" in French. The combination is known as \"steak-frites.\" Vegetables are not normally served with steak in this manner, but a green salad may follow or (more commonly) be served at the same time. This is also the case in Argentina.\n\nIn Italy, steak was not widely eaten until after World War II because the relatively rugged countryside does not readily accommodate the space and resource demands of large herds of cattle. Some areas of Piedmont and Tuscany, however, were renowned for the quality of their beef. \"Bistecca alla Fiorentina\" is a well-known specialty of Florence; it is typically served with just a salad. From the 1960s onward, economic gains allowed more Italians to afford a red meat diet.\n\nIn Mexico, as well as in Spain and other former Spanish colonies, \"bistec\" (a Spanish loanword from English \"beefsteak\") refers to dishes of salted and peppered beef sirloin strips. One form of Mexican bistec is usually flattened with a meat tenderizing tool, covered in bread crumbs and fried. The dish is usually served in tortillas as a taco.\n\nSpain and its former colonies have variations of \"bistec encebollado\" (beefsteak with onions). It can be found across Latin America and the Philippines in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"bistek Tagalog\", a specialty of the Tagalog provinces, is typically made with strips of sirloin beef and onions slowly cooked in soy sauce and calamansi juice. Unlike usual beefsteak that has different degrees of doneness, Filipino bistek is always served well done.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, steak is often served with chips (or french fries), fried onions, mushrooms, and tomatoes; however, in more expensive restaurants, it is more likely to be served with potatoes and other vegetables and offered with a selection of cooked sauces such as red wine, Diane, Bordelaise, mushroom, Hollandaise, \"au poivre\" (peppercorn), or Béarnaise. Other vegetables such as peas or a green salad can also be served. Various types of mustard are sometimes offered as a condiment.\n\nIn the United States, a restaurant that specializes in beef steaks is known as a steakhouse, and typical steak dinner consists of a steak, optionally topped with sautéed onions and mushrooms, with a starchy side dish; usually baked or mashed potatoes, or thick cut french fries known as steak fries. Chili, rice, pasta, or beans are also common sides. A side salad or a small serving of cooked vegetables often accompanies the meat and side, with corn on the cob, green beans, creamed spinach, asparagus, tomatoes, mushrooms, peas, and onion rings being popular. A well-known accompaniment to steak is shrimp or a cooked lobster tail, a combination often called \"surf and turf\" or \"reef and beef\", and \"pier and steer\". Rounding out an American steak dinner is some sort of bread, usually a dinner roll.\n\nSpecial steak knives are provided, which are usually serrated, though straight blades also work; they also often have wooden handles. Prepared condiments known as steak sauces are generally on the table in steakhouses. Tenderized round or sirloin steaks, breaded, and pan-fried or deep-fried, are called chicken fried or country fried steaks, respectively. Thinly sliced ribeye or other tender cuts, cooked on a hot griddle and shredded slightly, and served on Italian style rolls are called Philly steaks, named after Philadelphia, the city in which they became famous.\n\nThe amount of time a steak is cooked is based upon personal preference; shorter cooking times retain more juice, whereas longer steak cooking times result in drier, tougher meat but reduce concerns about disease. A vocabulary has evolved to describe the degree to which a steak is cooked. The following terms are in order from least cooked to most cooked:\n\nA style exists in some parts of North America called \"Chicago\". A Chicago-style steak is cooked to the desired level and then quickly charred. The diner orders it by asking for the style followed by the doneness (e.g. \"Chicago-style rare\"). A steak ordered \"Pittsburgh rare\" is rare or very rare on the inside and charred on the outside. In Pittsburgh, this style is referred to as \"black and blue\" (black or \"sooty\" on the outside, and blue rare on the inside).\n\n\nSeveral other foods are called \"steak\" without actually being steaks:\n\n"}
{"id": "61950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61950", "title": "Salad", "text": "Salad\n\nA salad is a dish consisting of a mixture of small pieces of food, usually vegetables. However, different varieties of salad may contain virtually any type of ready-to-eat food. Salads are typically served at room temperature or chilled, with notable exceptions such as south German potato salad which is served warm. \n\nGarden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach; they are common enough that the word \"salad\" alone often refers specifically to garden salads. Other types include bean salad, tuna salad, fattoush, Greek salad (vegetable based, but without leafy greens), and sōmen salad (a noodle-based salad). The sauce used to flavor a salad is commonly called a salad dressing; most salad dressings are based on either a mixture of oil and vinegar or a fermented milk product like kefir.\n\nSalads may be served at any point during a meal:\n\nThe word \"salad\" comes from the French \"salade\" of the same meaning, from the Latin \"salata\" (salty), from \"sal\" (salt). In English, the word first appears as \"salad\" or \"sallet\" in the 14th century. Salt is associated with salad because vegetables were seasoned with brine or salty oil-and-vinegar dressings during Roman times.\nThe phrase \"salad days\", meaning a \"time of youthful inexperience\" (based on the notion of \"green\"), is first recorded by Shakespeare in 1606, while the use of salad bar, referring to a buffet-style serving of salad ingredients, first appeared in American English in 1976.\n\nThe Romans and ancient Greeks ate mixed greens with dressing, a type of mixed salad. Salads, including layered and dressed salads, have been popular in Europe since the Greek and Roman imperial expansions. In his 1699 book, \"Acetaria: A Discourse on Sallets\", John Evelyn attempted with little success to encourage his fellow Britons to eat fresh salad greens. Mary, Queen of Scots, ate boiled celery root over greens covered with creamy mustard dressing, truffles, chervil, and slices of hard-boiled eggs.\n\nOil used on salads can be found in the 17th century colony of New Netherland (later called New York, New Jersey and Delaware). A list of common items arriving on ships and their designated prices when appraising cargo included \"a can of salad oil at 1.10 florins\" and \"an anker of wine vinegar at 16 florins\". In a 1665 letter to the Director of New Netherland from the Island of Curaçao there is a request to send greens: \"I request most amicably that your honors be pleased to send me seed of every sort, such as cabbage, carrots, lettuce, parsley, etc. for none can be acquired here and I know that your honor has plenty...\".\n\nSalads may be sold in supermarkets, at restaurants and at fast food chains. In the United States, restaurants will often have a \"salad bar\" with salad-making ingredients, which the customers will use to put together their salad. Salad restaurants were earning more than $300 million in 2014. At-home salad consumption in the 2010s was rising but moving away from fresh-chopped lettuce and toward bagged greens and salad kits, with bag sales expected to reach $7 billion per year.\n\nA salad can be composed (with the ingredients specifically arranged) or tossed (with the ingredients placed in a bowl and mixed).\n\nA green salad or garden salad is most often composed of leafy vegetables such as lettuce varieties, spinach, or rocket (arugula). If non-greens make up a large portion of the salad it may be called a vegetable salad instead of a green salad. Common raw vegetables (in the culinary sense) used in a salad include cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, onions, carrots, celery, radishes, mushrooms, avocado, olives, artichoke hearts, heart of palm, watercress, parsley, garden beets, and green beans. Nuts, berries, seeds, and flowers are less common components. Hard-boiled eggs, bacon, shrimp, and cheeses may be used as garnishes, but large amounts of animal based foods would be more likely in a dinner salad.\n\nA wedge salad is made from a head of lettuce (such as iceberg) halved or quartered, with other ingredients on top.\n\nBound salads are assembled with thick sauces such as mayonnaise. One portion of a true bound salad will hold its shape when placed on a plate with an ice-cream scoop. Examples of bound salad include tuna salad, chicken salad, egg salad, and potato salad. Bound salads are often used as sandwich fillings. They are popular at picnics and barbecues.\n\nMain course salads (also known as \"dinner salads\" or as \"entrée salads\" in North America) may contain poultry, seafood, or sliced steak. Caesar salad, Chef salad, Cobb salad, Chinese chicken salad and Michigan salad are dinner salads.\n\nFruit salads are made of fruit, which may be fresh or canned. Examples include fruit cocktail. Note that \"fruit\" here refers to culinary fruits, many common components of vegetable salads (such as tomatoes and cucumbers) are botanical fruits but culinary vegetables.\n\nDessert salads rarely include leafy greens and are often sweet. Common variants are made with gelatin or whipped cream; e.g. jello salad, pistachio salad, and ambrosia. Other forms of dessert salads include snickers salad, glorified rice, and cookie salad.\nSauces for salads are often called \"dressings\". The concept of salad dressing varies across cultures.\n\nIn Western culture, there are two basic types of salad dressing:\n\nIn North America, mayonnaise-based ranch dressing is most popular, with vinaigrettes and Caesar-style dressing following close behind. Traditional dressings in France are vinaigrettes, typically mustard-based, while sour cream (smetana) and mayonnaise are predominant in eastern European countries and Russia. Thicker sauces are sometimes referred to as \"baked potato\", as a form of metonymy, although they rarely contain any starch products. In Denmark, dressings are often based on crème fraîche. In southern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, salad is generally dressed by the diner with olive oil and vinegar. In Asia, it is common to add sesame oil, fish sauce, citrus juice, or soy sauce to salad dressings.\n\nOther salad dressings include:\n\nOn 4 September 2016, the largest recorded salad, weighing , was created in Red Square, Moscow, Russia, by Mouzenidis Travel. It was a Greek salad consisting of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, feta cheese, olive oil, oregano and salt.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61972", "title": "Tartar sauce", "text": "Tartar sauce\n\nTartar sauce (French: \"sauce tartare\"; also spelled Tartare sauce in the UK, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and other parts of the Commonwealth) is a condiment composed of mayonnaise and finely chopped capers. Tartar sauce can also be enhanced with the addition of gherkins, other varieties of pickles, lemon juice as well as herbs such as dill and parsley.\n\nIt is most often used as a condiment with seafood dishes such as clam strips, fried oysters, fish and chips, fish sandwiches, and fish fingers, among many other dishes.\n\nTartar sauce is based on either mayonnaise (egg yolk, mustard or vinegar, oil) or aioli (egg yolk, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice), with certain other ingredients added. In the UK, recipes typically add to the base capers, gherkins, lemon juice, and dill. US recipes may include chopped pickles or prepared green sweet relish, capers, onions (or chives), and fresh parsley. Chopped hard-boiled eggs or olives are sometimes added, as may be Dijon mustard and cocktail onions. Paul Bocuse describes sauce tartare explicitly as a sauce remoulade, in which the characterising anchovy purée is to be replaced by some hot Dijon mustard.\n\nUltimately, tartar sauce gets its name from the Golden Horde, Mongols who invaded Europe in the 13th century, who were known to the locals as Tartars. This name comes from confusion over their allies the Tatars, because of whom the Europeans called Mongolia Tartary. This misnomer came from associating the name Tatar with the Greek mythological hell known as Tartarus. \n\nThe Mongols brought a tradition of finely minced meat, often eaten raw. That style of raw, minced meat made its way to Russia, then Hamburg, then the US with German immigrants. There it became known as Hamburg steak, a raw minced beef patty with onions and bread crumbs. This travelled back to Europe as \"steacke à l'Americane\", but as the novelty wore off gradually came to be known as steak tartare, and the sauce used on it as tartar sauce.\n\n"}
{"id": "62149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62149", "title": "Custard", "text": "Custard\n\nCustard is a variety of culinary preparations based on milk or cream cooked with egg yolk to thicken it, and sometimes also flour, corn starch, or gelatin. Depending on the recipe, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring sauce (\"crème anglaise\") to the thick pastry cream (\"crème pâtissière\") used to fill éclairs. The most common custards are used in desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla, however savory custards are also found, \"e.g.\" in quiche.\n\nCustard is usually cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie), or heated very gently in a saucepan on a stove, though custard can also be steamed, baked in the oven with or without a water bath, or even cooked in a pressure cooker. Custard preparation is a delicate operation, because a temperature increase of 3–6 °C (5–10 °F) leads to overcooking and curdling. Generally, a fully cooked custard should not exceed 80 °C (~175 °F); it begins setting at 70 °C (~160 °F). A water bath slows heat transfer and makes it easier to remove the custard from the oven before it curdles. A sous-vide water bath may be used to precisely control temperature.\n\nMixtures of milk and eggs thickened by heat have long been part of European cuisine, since at least Ancient Rome. Custards baked in pastry (custard tarts) were very popular in the Middle Ages, and are the origin of the English word 'custard': the French term 'croustade' originally referred to the \"crust\" of a tart, and is derived from the Italian word crostata, and ultimately the Latin \"crustāre\".\n\nExamples include \"Crustardes of flessh\" and \"Crustade\", in the 14th century English collection \"The Forme of Cury\". These recipes include solid ingredients such as meat, fish, and fruit bound by the custard. Stirred custards cooked in pots are also found under the names \"Creme Boylede\" and \"Creme boiled\".\n\nIn modern times, the name 'custard' is sometimes applied to starch-thickened preparations like blancmange and Bird's Custard powder.\n\nWhile \"custard\" may refer to a wide variety of thickened dishes, technically (and in French cookery) the word \"custard\" (\"crème\" or more precisely \"crème moulée\", ) refers only to an egg-thickened custard.\n\nWhen starch is added, the result is called \"pastry cream\" (, ) or confectioners' custard, made with a combination of milk or cream, egg yolks, fine sugar, flour or some other starch, and usually a flavoring such as vanilla, chocolate, or lemon. \"Crème pâtissière\" is a key ingredient in many French desserts including mille-feuille (or Napoleons) and filled tarts. It is also used in Italian pastry and sometimes in Boston cream pie. The thickening of the custard is caused by the combination of egg and cornstarch. Corn flour or flour thicken at 100 °C (212˚F) and as such many recipes instruct the pastry cream to be boiled. In a traditional custard such as a \"crème anglaise\", where egg is used alone as a thickener, boiling results in the over cooking and subsequent 'curdling' of the custard; however, in a pastry cream, starch prevents this. Once cooled, the amount of starch in pastry cream 'sets' the cream and requires it to be beaten or whipped before use.\nWhen gelatin is added, it is known as \"crème anglaise collée\" (). When gelatin is added and whipped cream is folded in, and it sets in a mold, it is \"bavarois\". When starch is used alone as a thickener (without eggs), the result is a \"blancmange\". In the United Kingdom, \"custard\" has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see custard powder.\n\nAfter the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites and gelatin, it is chiboust cream; mixed with whipped cream, it is \"crème légère\", . Beating in softened butter produces German buttercream or crème mousseline.\n\nA quiche is a savoury custard tart. Some kinds of timbale or vegetable loaf are made of a custard base mixed with chopped savoury ingredients. \"Custard royale\" is a thick custard cut into decorative shapes and used to garnish soup, stew or broth. In German it is known as Eierstich and is used as a garnish in German Wedding Soup (Hochzeitssuppe). Chawanmushi is a Japanese savoury custard, steamed and served in a small bowl or on a saucer. Chinese steamed egg is a similar but larger savoury egg dish.\n\nCustard may also be used as a top layer in gratins, such as the South African bobotie and many Balkan versions of moussaka.\n\nRecipes involving sweet custard are listed in the , and include:\n\nCooked (set) custard is a weak gel, viscous and thixotropic; while it does become easier to stir the more it is manipulated, it does not, unlike many other thixotropic liquids, recover its lost viscosity over time. On the other hand, a suspension of uncooked imitation custard powder (starch) in water, with the proper proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, allowing the demonstration of \"walking on custard\".\n\nEggs contain the proteins necessary for the gel structure to form, and emulsifiers to maintain the structure. Egg yolk also contains enzymes like amylase, which can break down added starch. This enzyme activity contributes to the overall thinning of custard in the mouth. Egg yolk lecithin also helps to maintain the milk-egg interface. The proteins in egg whites set at 60-80˚C (140-180˚F).\n\nStarch is sometimes added to custard to prevent premature curdling. The starch acts as a heat buffer in the mixture: as they hydrate, they absorb heat and help maintain a constant rate of heat transfer. Starches also make for a smoother texture and thicker mouthfeel.\n\nIf the mixture pH is 9 or higher, the gel is too hard; if it is below 5, the gel structure has difficulty forming because of protonation prevents the formation of covalent bonds.\n\n"}
{"id": "62153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62153", "title": "Soy sauce", "text": "Soy sauce\n\nSoy sauce (also called soya sauce in British English) is a liquid condiment of Chinese origin, made from a fermented paste of soybeans, roasted grain, brine, and \"Aspergillus oryzae\" or \"Aspergillus sojae\" molds. Soy sauce in its current form was created about 2,200 years ago during the Western Han dynasty of ancient China, and spread throughout East and Southeast Asia where it is used in cooking and as a condiment.\n\nSoy sauce (醬油) is considered almost as old as soy paste—a type of fermented paste (Jiang, ) obtained from soybeans—which had appeared during the Western Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) and was listed in the bamboo slips found in the archaeological site Mawangdui (馬王堆). There are several precursors of soy sauce that are associated products with soy paste. Among them the earliest one is \"Qingjiang\" (清醬) that had appeared in AD 40 and was listed in \"Simin Yueling\" (). Others are \"Jiangqing\" (醬清), \"Chizhi\" (豉汁) and \"Chiqing\" (豉清) which are recorded in \"Qimin Yaoshu\" () in AD 540. By the time of the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), the term \"soy sauce\" (醬油) had become the accepted name for the liquid condiment, which are documented in two books: \"Shanjia Qinggong\" (山家清供) and \"Pujiang Wushi Zhongkuilu\" (浦江吳氏中饋錄) during the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD).\n\nLike many salty condiments, soy sauce was originally a way to stretch salt, historically an expensive commodity. During the Zhou dynasty of ancient China, fermented fish with salt was used as a condiment in which soybeans were included during the fermentation process. By the time of the Han dynasty, this had been replaced with the recipe for soy paste and its by-product soy sauce, by using soybeans as the principal ingredient, with fermented fish-based sauces developing separately into fish sauce.\n\nThe 19th century Sinologist Samuel Wells Williams wrote that in China, the best soy sauce is \"made by boiling beans soft, adding an equal quantity of wheat or barley, and leaving the mass to ferment; a portion of salt and three times as much water are afterwards put in, and the whole compound left for two or three months when the liquid is pressed and strained\".\n\nThe earliest soy sauce brewing in Korea seems to have begun prior to the era of the Three Kingdoms c. 57 BC. The \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\", a Chinese historical text written and published in the 3rd century, mentions that \"Goguryeo people are good at brewing fermented soy beans.\" in the section named \"Dongyi\" (Eastern foreigners), in the \"Book of Wei\". Jangdoks used for soy sauce brewing are found in the mural paintings of Anak Tomb No.3 from the 4th century Goguryeo.\n\nIn \"Samguk Sagi\", a historical record of the Three Kingdoms era, it is written that \"ganjang\" (soy sauce) and \"doenjang\" (soybean paste) along with \"meju\" (soybean block) and \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood) were prepared for the wedding ceremony of the King Sinmun in February 683. \"Sikhwaji\", a section from \"Goryeosa\" (History of Goryeo), recorded that \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang\" were included in the relief supplies in 1018, after a Khitan invasion, and in 1052, when a famine occurred. Joseon texts such as \"Guhwangchwaryo\" and \"Jeungbo sallim gyeongje\" contain the detailed procedures on how to brew good quality \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang.\" \"Gyuhap chongseo\" explains how to pick a date for brewing, what to forbear, and how to keep and preserve \"ganjang\" and \"doenjang\".\n\nChinese Buddhist monks introduced soy sauce into Japan in the 7th century, where it is known as .\n\nRecords of the Dutch East India Company list soy sauce as a commodity in 1737, when seventy-five large barrels were shipped from Dejima, Japan, to Batavia (present-day Jakarta) on the island of Java. Thirty-five barrels from that shipment were then shipped to the Netherlands. In the 18th century, diplomat and scholar Isaac Titsingh published accounts of brewing soy sauce. Although earlier descriptions of soy sauce had been disseminated in the West, his was among the earliest to focus specifically on the brewing of the Japanese version. By the mid-19th century, Japanese soy sauce gradually disappeared from the European market, and the condiment became synonymous with the Chinese product. Europeans were unable to make soy sauce because they did not understand the function of \"Aspergillus oryzae\", the fungus used in its brewing. Soy sauce made from ingredients such as Portobello mushrooms were disseminated in European cookbooks during the late 18th century. A Swedish recipe for \"\"Soija\"\" was published in the 1770 edition of Cajsa Warg's \"Hjelpreda i Hushållningen för Unga Fruentimber\" and was flavored with allspice and mace.\n\nSoy sauce is made either by fermentation or by hydrolysis. Some commercial sauces have both fermented and chemical sauces.\n\nFlavor, color, and aroma developments during production are attributed to non-enzymatic Maillard browning.\n\nVariation is usually achieved as the result of different methods and durations of fermentation, different ratios of water, salt, and fermented soy, or through the addition of other ingredients.\n\nTraditional soy sauces are made by mixing soybeans and grain with mold cultures such as \"Aspergillus oryzae\" and other related microorganisms and yeasts (the resulting mixture is called \"koji\" in Japan; the term \"koji\" is used both for the mixture of soybeans, wheat, and mold as well as for the mold itself). Historically, the mixture was fermented naturally in large urns and under the sun, which was believed to contribute extra flavors. Today, the mixture is placed in a temperature and humidity controlled incubation chamber.\n\nTraditional soy sauces take months to make:\n\nSome brands of soy sauce are made from acid-hydrolyzed soy protein instead of brewed with a traditional culture. This takes about three days. Although they have a different flavor, aroma, and texture when compared to brewed soy sauces, they can be produced more quickly and cheaply, and also have a longer shelf life and are usually made for these reasons. The clear plastic packets of dark sauce common with Chinese-style take-out food typically use a hydrolyzed vegetable protein formula. Some higher-priced hydrolyzed vegetable protein products with no added sugar or colorings are sold as low-sodium soy sauce alternatives called \"liquid aminos\" in health food stores, similar to the way salt substitutes are used. These products are, however, not necessarily low in sodium.\n\nHigh-salt liquid-state fermentation (HLF) of soybeans depends heavily on microbial activity, metabolism and enzymatic hydrolysis of macro-nutrients. \n\nLSF, also referred as rapid fermenting, is a modern fermentation method invented in response to high market demand. \n\nThe chemical composition of soy sauce can be affected easily by raw materials, fermentation methodologies, fermenting molds and strains, and post-fermentation treatments. \nThe primary fermentation of lactic-acid-fermenting halophiles has lower the pH of the moromi, and this has directly resulted in an acidic pH range (4.4–5.4) of soy sauce products. The secondary fermentation conducted by heterofermentative microbes provides soy sauce with a wide range of flavor and odorant compounds by breaking down macro-nutrients. Soy proteins and grain proteins are hydrolyzed into short peptide chain and free amino acids, which adds umami taste to the product. Based on the result of free amino acid analysis, the most abundant amino acids in Chinese soy sauce product are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and leucine.\n\n\nThe taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweet taste, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids. Besides, the interaction between glutamine and sodium cation may have given rise to sodium glutamate (MSG), which can further contribute to the umami flavor. Basic tastes can also be attributed to amino acids groups arranged in specific sequence. In soy sauce, it was found that \"amino acids were grouped as MSG-like (monosodium glutamate-like) (Asp+Glu), sweet (Ala+Gly+Ser+Thr), bitter (Arg+His+Ile+Leu+Met+Phe+Trp+Try+Val), and tasteless (Cys+Lys+Pro)\".\n\nDespite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product \"per se\" does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes are identified in Chinese soy sauces. An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a \"critical balance\" achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low.\n\nSoy sauce is widely used as an important flavoring and has been integrated into the traditional cuisines of many East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. Despite their rather similar appearance, soy sauces made in different cultures and regions are different in taste, consistency, fragrance and saltiness. Soy sauce retains its quality longer when kept away from direct sunlight.\n\nBurmese soy sauce production is dated back to the Bagan era in the 9th and 10th century. Scripts written in praise of \"pe ngan byar yay\" (, literally \"bean fish sauce\") were found. Thick soy sauce is called \"kya nyo\" (, from Chinese \"jiàngyóu\").\n\nChinese soy sauces (; or alternatively, ; ) are primarily made from soybeans, with relatively low amounts of other grains. Chinese soy sauce can be roughly split into two classes: brewed or blended. Chinese soy sauces can also be classified into Low-Salt Solid-State fermented soy sauce (LSF), and High-Salt Liquid-State fermented soy sauce (HLF).\n\nSoy sauce that has been brewed directly from a fermentation process using wheat, soybeans, salt, and water without additional additives.\n\n\nAdditives with sweet or umami (savory) tastes are sometimes added to a finished brewed soy sauce to modify its taste and texture.\n\n\nIn the Philippines, soy sauce is called \"toyò\" in the native languages, derived from \"Tau-yu\" in Hokkien and is a broad term used for both the Japanese \"shōyu\" and Chinese \"jiàngyóu\". Philippine soy sauce is usually a combination of soybeans, wheat, salt, and caramel color. It is thinner in texture and has a saltier taste than its Southeast Asian counterparts, similar to Japanese variety.\n\n\"Toyò\" is used as a marinade, an ingredient in cooked dishes, and most often as a table condiment, usually alongside other sauces such as fish sauce (\"patís\") and sugar cane vinegar (\"sukà\"). It is often mixed and served with the juice of the calamansi (× \"Citrofortunella microcarpa\"; also called calamondin, \"limonsito\"). The combination is known as \"toyomansî\", which can be comparable to the Japanese \"ponzu\" sauce (soy sauce with yuzu). Toyò is also a main ingredient in \"Philippine adobo\", one of the more famous dishes of Filipino cuisine.\n\nSoy sauce is a very popular condiment and marinade for many dishes in the Hawaiian cuisine. \"Aloha shoyu\" is soy sauce made in the Islands. Aloha is of the acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein variety.\n\nIn Indonesia, soy sauce is known as \"kecap\" (old spelling: \"ketjap\"), which is a catch-all term for fermented sauces, and cognate to the English word \"ketchup\". The most popular type of soy sauce in Indonesian cuisine is \"kecap manis\" or sweet soy sauce. The term \"kecap\" is also used to describe other non soy-based sauces, such as \"kecap ikan\" (fish sauce) and \"kecap Inggris\" (worcestershire sauce; lit. \"English sauce\", due to worchestershire sauce originating in England). Three common varieties of soy-based \"kecap\" exist in Indonesian cuisine, used either as ingredients or condiments:\n\n\n\"Shōyu\" is traditionally divided into five main categories depending on differences in their ingredients and method of production. Most, but not all Japanese soy sauces include wheat as a primary ingredient, which tends to give them a slightly sweeter taste than their Chinese counterparts. They also tend towards an alcoholic sherry-like flavor, sometimes enhanced by the addition of small amounts of alcohol as a natural preservative. The widely varying flavors of these soy sauces are not always interchangeable, some recipes only call for one type or the other, much as a white wine cannot replace a red's flavor or beef stock does not make the same results as fish stock.\n\nSome soy sauces made in the Japanese way or styled after them contain about 50% wheat.\n\n\nNewer varieties of Japanese soy sauce include:\n\n\nAll of these varieties are sold in the marketplace in three different grades according to how they were made:\n\n\nAll the varieties and grades may be sold according to three official levels of quality:\n\n\nSoy sauce is also commonly known as \"shoyu\", and less commonly \"shōyu\", in Hawaii and Brazil.\n\nIn South Korea, soy sauces or \"ganjang\" (, \"seasoning sauce\") can be roughly split into two categories: \"hansik ganjang\" (Korean-style soy sauce) and \"gaeryang ganjang\" (modernized soy sauce). The term \"ganjang\" can also refer to non soy-based salty condiments, such as \"eo-ganjang (fish sauce)\".\n\"Hansik ganjang\" (, \"Korean-style soy sauce\") is made entirely of fermented soybean (meju) and brine. It is a byproduct of \"doenjang\" (fermented soybean paste) production, and has a unique fermented soybean flavour. Both lighter in colour and saltier than other Korean ganjang varieties, \"hansik ganjang\" is used mainly in guk (soup) and namul (seasoned vegetable dish) in modern Korean cuisine. Common names for \"hansik ganjang\" include \"jaeraesik ganjang\" (, \"traditional soy sauce\"), \"Joseon-ganjang\" (, \"Joseon soy sauce\"), and \"guk-ganjang\" (, \"soup soy sauce\"). The homebrewed variety is also called \"jip-ganjang\" (, \"home soy sauce\").\n\nDepending on the length of aging, \"hansik ganjang\" can be divided into three main varieties: clear, middle, and dark.\nKorean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies \"hansik-ganjang\" into two categories by their ingredients.\n\n\"Gaeryang-ganjang\" (, \"modernized soy sauce\"), referring to varieties of soy sauces not made of meju, is now the most widely used type of soy sauce in modern Korean cuisine. The word \"ganjang\" without modifiers in bokkeum (stir-fry), jorim (braised or simmered dishes), and jjim (steamed dishes) recipes usually mean \"gaeryang-ganjang\". Another common name of \"gaeryang-ganjang\" is \"jin-ganjang\" (, \"dark soy sauce\"), because \"gaeryang-ganjang\" varieties are usually darker in appearance compared to traditional \"hansik ganjang\". Having been introduced to Korea during the era of Japanese forced occupation, \"garyang ganjang\" is also called \"Wae-ganjang\" (, \"Wae soy sauce\").\n\nKorean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies \"gaeryang-ganjang\" into four categories by their method of production.\n\n\nMalays from Malaysia, using the Malay dialect similar to Indonesian, use the word \"kicap\" for soy sauce. \"Kicap\" is traditionally of two types: \"kicap lemak\" (lit \"fat/rich soy sauce\") and \"kicap cair\". \"Kicap lemak\" is similar to Indonesian \"kecap manis\" but with very much less sugar while \"kicap cair\" is the Malaysian equivalent of \"kecap asin\".\n\nSoy sauce or soya sauce () is a popular food product used in Sri Lanka and is a major ingredient used in the nationally popular street food dish, Kottu. Soy sauce has largely been produced by the Sri Lankan Chinese community but its production has also spread to other communities in Sri Lanka. Soy sauce production in Sri Lanka is the same as the production of soy sauce in Indonesia. Fermentation occurs over a period of three months. The soya beans which are steeped in brine are then pressed to obtain a liquid sauce.\n\nThe history of soy sauce making in Taiwan can be traced back to southeastern China, in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Taiwanese soy sauce is known for its black bean variant, known as black bean soy sauce (黑豆蔭油), which takes longer to make (about 6 months). Most major soy sauce makers in Taiwan make soy sauce from soybeans and wheat, and are widely popular, and are available in many Oriental Foods and Grocery Stores. Some make black bean soy sauce, which is very widely used in Chinese and Oriental cooking as an excellent flavor enhancer.\n\nIn Thailand, soy sauce is called \"sii-íu\" ().\n\"Sii-íu kǎao\" (, \"white soy sauce\") is used as regular soy sauce in Thai cuisine, while \"sii-íu dam\" (, \"black soy sauce\") is used primarily for colour. Another darker-coloured variety, \"sii-íu wǎan\" (, \"sweet soy sauce\") is used for dipping sauces.\n\"Sɔ́ɔt prung rót\" (, \"seasoning sauce\") is also commonly used in modern Thai cuisine.\n\nIn Vietnam, Chinese-style soy sauce is called \"xì dầu\" (derived from the Cantonese name 豉油) or \"nước tương\". The term \"soy sauce\" could also imply other condiments and soy bean paste with thick consistency known as \"tương\". Both are used mostly as a seasoning or dipping sauce for a number of dishes. Vietnamese cuisine itself favors fish sauce in cooking but \"nước tương\" has a clear presence in vegetarian cuisine.\n\nA study by the National University of Singapore showed that Chinese dark soy sauce contains 10 times the antioxidants of red wine, and can help prevent cardiovascular diseases. Soy sauce is rich in lactic acid bacteria and of excellent anti-allergic potential.\n\nSoy sauce does not contain the level of isoflavones associated with other soy products such as tofu or edamame. It can also be very salty, having a salt content between 14–18%. Low-sodium soy sauces are made, but it is difficult to make soy sauce without using some quantity of salt as an antimicrobial agent.\n\nA serving of of soy sauce contains, according to the USDA:\n\nSoy sauce may contain ethyl carbamate, a Group 2A carcinogen.\n\nIn 2001, the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency found in testing various soy sauces manufactured in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Thailand (made from hydrolyzed soy protein, rather than being naturally fermented) that 22% of tested samples, contained a chemical carcinogen named 3-MCPD (3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol) at levels considerably higher than those deemed safe by the EU. About two-thirds of these samples also contained a second carcinogenic chemical named 1,3-DCP (1,3-dichloropropane-2-ol) which experts advise should not be present at any levels in food. Both chemicals have the potential to cause cancer, and the Agency recommended that the affected products be withdrawn from shelves and avoided. The same carcinogens were found in soy sauces manufactured in Vietnam, causing a food scare in 2007.\n\nIn Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society writes,\nMost varieties of soy sauce contain wheat, to which some people have a medical intolerance. However, some naturally brewed soy sauces made with wheat may be tolerated by people with a specific intolerance to gluten because gluten is not detectable in the finished product. Japanese tamari soy sauce is traditionally wheat-free, and some tamari available commercially today is wheat- and gluten-free.\n"}
{"id": "62168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62168", "title": "Trifle", "text": "Trifle\n\nTrifle in English cuisine is a dessert made with fruit, a thin layer of sponge fingers soaked in sherry or another fortified wine, and custard. It can be topped with whipped cream. The fruit and sponge layers may be suspended in fruit-flavoured jelly, and these ingredients are usually arranged to produce three or four layers. The contents of a trifle are highly variable; many varieties exist, some forgoing fruit entirely and instead using other ingredients such as chocolate, coffee or vanilla. \n\nThe name trifle was used for a dessert like a fruit fool in the sixteenth century; by the eighteenth century, Hannah Glasse records a recognisably modern trifle, with the inclusion of a gelatin jelly. Many of the ingredients used in ancient trifles can be found in meats and other products found today. According to some scholars, trifle cakes might be the origin of modern sandwich cakes.\n\nThe earliest use of the name \"trifle\" was in a recipe for a thick cream flavoured with sugar, ginger and rosewater, in Thomas Dawson's 1585 book of English cookery \"The Good Huswifes Jewell\". Trifle evolved from a similar dessert known as a fool, and originally the two names were used interchangeably.\n\nJelly is first recorded as part of the recipe in later editions of Hannah Glasse's eighteenth century book \"The Art of Cookery\". In her recipe she instructed using hartshorn or bones of calves feet as the base ingredient (to supply gelatin) for the jelly. The poet Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote of trifles containing jelly in 1861.\n\nTrifles may contain a small amount of alcohol such as port or punsch, or, most commonly, sweet sherry or madeira wine. Non-alcoholic versions use sweet juices or soft drinks such as ginger ale instead, as the liquid is necessary to moisten the cake and are simply known as \"fruit trifle\" without any mention of a spirit before the name of the trifle.\n\nOne popular trifle variant has the sponge soaked in jelly when the trifle is made, which sets when refrigerated. The cake and jelly bind together and produce a pleasant texture if made in the correct proportions. Originally, a jelly, often containing fresh or preserved fruit, would have been presented separately next to the trifle 'proper'; which could be made with stiff custard and cream and delivered on the presentation plate directly from a large mould and then often elaborately decorated with sweetened and flavoured piped cream, and carefully arranged pieces of glacé fruit and angelica in a neat and regimented fashion in the Georgian and Victorian styles.\n\nThe Scots have a similar dish to trifle, tipsy laird, made with Drambuie or whisky. In the Southern US, a variant of trifle is known as tipsy cake.\n\nA trifle is often used for decoration as well as taste, incorporating the bright, layered colours of the fruit, jelly, jam, and the contrast of the creamy yellow custard and white cream.\nTrifles are often served at Christmas, sometimes as a lighter alternative to the much denser Christmas pudding.\n\nA Creole trifle (also sometimes known as a Russian cake or a Russian Slab) is a different but related dessert item consisting of pieces of a variety of cakes mixed and packed firmly, moistened with alcohol (commonly red wine or rum) and a sweet syrup or fruit juice, and chilled. The resulting cake contains a variety of colour and flavour. A similar dessert in Germany and Austria goes by the name of Punschtorte.\n\nIn Italy, a dessert similar to and probably based on trifle is known as \"zuppa inglese\", literally \"English Soup\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62785", "title": "Edamame", "text": "Edamame\n\nEdamame is a preparation of immature soybeans in the pod, found in cuisines with origins in East Asia. The pods are boiled or steamed and may be served with salt. In Japan, they are usually blanched in 4% salt water and not served with salt. When the beans are outside the pod, the term mukimame and edamame in Japanese are also sometimes used.\n\nIn Japan and Hong Kong, the name \"edamame\" is commonly used to refer to the dish. It literally means \"stem peas\" (枝 \"eda\" = \"branch\" or \"stem\" + 豆 \"mame\" = \"pea\"), because the beans were often sold while still attached to the stem.\n\nIn China, \"maodou\" is used commonly to refer to the dish, which literally means \"fur peas\" (毛 \"mao\" = \"fur\" + 豆 \"dou\" = \"pea\").\n\nThe earliest documented reference to the term \"edamame\" dates from the year 1275, when the Japanese monk Nichiren wrote a note thanking a parishioner for the gift of \"edamame\" he had left at the temple.\nIn 1406 during the Ming dynasty in China, the leaves of the soybeans were eaten, and during outbreaks of famine, it was recommended for citizens to eat the beans whole or use them ground up and added to flour. Years later in China in 1620 they are referred to again, but as \"maodou\", which translates to the term \"hairy bean\". They are found in the records of the Runan vegetable gardens and stated as having a medicinal purpose, as well as being a snack food. Edamame appeared in haikai verse in Japanese in the Edo period (1603–1868), with one example as early as 1638.\n\nThey were first recognized in the United States in 1855, when a farmer commented on the difficulties he had shelling them after harvest. In March 1923, the immature soy bean is first referred to in text in the United States. In this book they are first pictured and shown as being eaten out of open shell pods. The first nutritional facts about them are published and some recipes are included, as they were a new type of vegetable to the public. The earliest recorded usage in English of the word \"edamame\" is in 1951 in the journal \"Folklore Studies\". \"Edamame\" appeared as a new term in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003 and in the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, the first soybeans grown in Europe were sold in grocery stores as edamame and eaten as an alternative source of protein.\n\nEdamame is typically harvested by hand to avoid damaging the crop's stems and leaves. Green soybean pods are picked before they fully ripen, typically 35 to 40 days after the crop first flowers. Soybeans harvested at this stage are sweeter because they contain more sucrose than soybeans picked later in the growing season. Other factors contributing to edamame's flavor include free amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and alanine. Often these unbound amino acids decrease as the pods fully expand and ripen.\n\nPods may be boiled in water, steamed, or microwaved. The ends of the pod are sometimes cut before boiling or steaming. The most common preparations use salt for taste, either dissolved in the boiling water before introducing the soybean pods or added after cooking. \n\nEdamame is a popular side dish at Japanese izakaya restaurants with local varieties being in demand, depending on the season. Salt and garlic are typical condiments for edamame. In Japan, a coarse salt wet with brine is preferred on beans eaten directly from the pod.\n\nEdamame purchased fresh is preferably eaten the same day, with flavor degradation being noticeable in as few as 10 hours after harvest. However, fresh edamame will stay edible for three days when stored in the refrigerator. Damaged pods brown more rapidly however, mainly due to the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. If stored fresh, the pods should be kept humid to prevent discoloration and wilting. This can be accomplished by wrapping the pods in plastic or another material which traps moisture.\n\nFreezing fresh edamame is another option for maintaining good quality over a few months. Fresh edamame should be blanched first before being frozen.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture states that edamame beans are a \"soybean that can be eaten fresh and are best known as a snack with a nutritional punch\".\n\nEdamame and other preparations of soybeans are rich in protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients, particularly folate, manganese, phosphorus and vitamin K (table).\n\nThe balance of fatty acids in 100 grams of edamame is 361 mg of omega-3 fatty acids to 1794 mg of omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nAs a significant source of plant protein, edamame beans are under research to establish whether a relationship exists between soy consumption and reduction of disease risk.\n"}
{"id": "63532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63532", "title": "Lutefisk", "text": "Lutefisk\n\nLutefisk (Norwegian, ) or lutfisk (Swedish, ; ) is a traditional dish of some Nordic countries. It is traditionally part of the Norwegian julebord and Swedish julbord, as well as the similar Finnish joulupöytä.\n\nIt is made from aged stockfish (air-dried whitefish) or dried/salted whitefish (\"klippfisk\") and lye (\"lut\"). It is gelatinous in texture. Its name literally means \"lye fish\".\n\nLutefisk is dried whitefish (normally cod, but ling and burbot are also used) treated with lye. The first step is soaking the stockfish in cold water for five to six days (with the water changed daily). The saturated stockfish is then soaked in an unchanged solution of cold water and lye for an additional two days. The fish swells during this soaking, and its protein content decreases by more than 50 percent, producing a jelly-like consistency.\n\nWhen this treatment is finished, the fish (saturated with lye) is caustic, with a pH of 11–12. To make the fish edible, a final treatment of yet another four to six days of soaking in cold water (also changed daily) is needed. Eventually, the lutefisk is ready to be cooked.\n\nIn Finland, the traditional reagent used is birch ash. It contains high amounts of potassium carbonate and bicarbonate, giving the fish a more mellow treatment than wood lye. It is important not to marinate the fish too long in the lye because saponification of the fish fats may occur.\n\nAfter the preparation, the lutefisk is saturated with water and must therefore be cooked extremely carefully so that it does not fall to pieces.\nTo create a firm consistency in lutefisk, it is common to spread a layer of salt over the fish about half an hour before it is cooked. This will \"release\" some of the water in the fish meat. The salt must be rinsed off carefully before cooking.\n\nLutefisk does not need additional water for the cooking; it is sufficient to place it in a pan, salt it, seal the lid tightly, and let it steam cook under a very low heat for 20–25 minutes. An alternative is to wrap in aluminium foil and bake at 225 °C (435 °F) for 40–50 minutes.\n\nAnother option is to parboil lutefisk; wrapped in cheesecloth and gently boiled until tender. Lutefisk can also be boiled directly in a pan of water.\n\nLutefisk sold in North America may also be cooked in a microwave oven. The average cooking time is 8–10 minutes per whole fish (a package of two fish sides) at high power in a covered glass cooking dish, preferably made of heat resistant glass. The cooking time will vary, depending upon the power of the microwave oven.\n\nWhen cooking and eating lutefisk, it is important to clean the lutefisk and its residue off pans, plates, and utensils immediately. Lutefisk left overnight becomes nearly impossible to remove. Sterling silver should never be used in the cooking, serving or eating of lutefisk, which will permanently ruin silver. Stainless steel utensils are recommended instead.\n\nIn Norway, Lutefisk is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, mashed green peas, melted butter and small pieces of fried bacon.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, lutefisk is a part of the Christmas tradition and is mostly eaten with boiled potatoes, green peas and white sauce. Regional variations include a sprinkle of freshly ground allspice or black pepper and the addition of coarsely ground mustard in the white sauce (in Scania). In parts of Jämtland it is served on flat bread along with whey cheese.\n\nIn the United States, lutefisk is often served with a variety of side dishes—including bacon, peas, pea stew, potatoes, lefse, gravy, mashed rutabaga, white sauce, melted or clarified butter, syrup, and geitost, or \"old\" cheese (gammelost). It is sometimes eaten with meatballs, which is not traditional in Scandinavia. Side dishes vary greatly from family to family and region to region, and can be a source of jovial contention when eaters of different \"traditions\" of lutefisk dine together.\n\nToday, akvavit and beer often accompany the meal due to its use at festive and ceremonial occasions.\n\nLutefisk prepared from cod is somewhat notorious – even in Scandinavia – for its intensely offensive odor. Conversely, lutefisk prepared from pollock or haddock emits almost no odor.\n\nThe taste of well-prepared lutefisk is very mild, and the white sauce is often spiced with pepper or other strong-tasting spices. In Minnesota, this method (seasoned with allspice) is common among Swedish-Americans, while Norwegian-Americans often prefer to eat it unseasoned with melted butter or cream sauce.\n\nAn article in \"Smithsonian\" magazine quotes some oft-rendered tall tales regarding the origins of the dish:\n\nThe actual reason is probably that the lack of major salt deposits in the area favored the drying process for the preservation of whitefish - a process known for millennia. Stockfish is very nutrient-rich, and one can assume that it was also consumed domestically, although it was during the boom in the stockfish trade in the late Middle Ages, the product became accessible throughout Scandinavia, as well as the rest of Europe. The higher quality stockfish would be soaked in water, then boiled and eaten with melted butter. Lower grade qualities would be harder and more fuel consuming to boil and it has been suggested that adding ash from beech or birch in the boiling water, would break down the protein chains and speed up the process. The introduction of lye in the preparation process might therefore have been incidental.\n\nLutefisk as a Christmas season meal has gained attention in Norway over the past 20 years. The Norwegian Seafood Export Council indicated sales of lutefisk to restaurants and catering companies in Norway increased by 72% between 2005 and 2008. A 2005 survey found 20% of Norwegians ate lutefisk during the Christmas holiday season, although only 3% would consider it for their Christmas dinner.\n\nFar more lutefisk is consumed in the United States than in Scandinavia, much of it by Scandinavian Americans in Lutheran churches and fraternal lodges.\n\nMadison, Minnesota has dubbed itself the \"lutefisk capital of the world\" as well as claiming the largest per capita consumption of lutefisk in Minnesota. St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota serves lutefisk during their Christmas Festival concerts. They also host an annual music festival called \"Lutefest\". Lutefisk, though, is not served at this festival.\n\nLutefisk is also consumed in Canada because of its relatively large Scandinavian population, particularly in Western Canada. There are about 450,000 Norwegian Canadians, 340,000 Swedish Canadians, 200,000 Danish Canadians and 136,000 Finnish Canadians. Organizations such as the Sons of Norway hold annual lutefisk dinners. Lutefisk is sometimes available in specialty stores and supermarkets where there are large Scandinavian populations. Kingman, Alberta proclaims itself on its greeting sign to be the \"Lutefisk capital of Alberta\".\n\nThe Wisconsin \"Employees' Right to Know Law\" specifically exempts lutefisk in defining \"toxic substances\".\n\n\n"}

Over the last century, surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology. Its modern founder was the Italian scientist Giovan Battista Morgagni from Forlì.\n\nAnatomical pathology is one of two branches of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids and/or tissues. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology.\n\nAnatomic pathology relates to the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures. Its subsections include chemistry, hematology, microbiology, immunology, urinalysis and blood bank.\n\nAnatomical pathology is itself divided in subspecialties, the main ones being surgical pathology (breast, gynecological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, soft tissue, head and neck, dermatopathology), neuropathology, hematopathology cytopathology, and forensic pathology. To be licensed to practice pathology, one has to complete medical school and secure a license to practice medicine. An approved residency program and certification (in the U.S., the American Board of Pathology or the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology) is usually required to obtain employment or hospital privileges.\n\nThe procedures used in anatomic pathology include:\n\nSurgical pathology is the most significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with clinical pathology such as molecular diagnostics.\n\nIn the United States, subspecialty-trained doctors of dentistry, rather than medical doctors, can be certified by a professional board to practice Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.\n\nCytopathology is a sub-discipline of anatomical pathology concerned with the microscopic examination of whole, individual cells obtained from exfoliation or fine-needle aspirates. Cytopathologists are trained to perform fine-needle aspirates of superficially located organs, masses, or cysts and are often able to render an immediate diagnosis in the presence of the patient and consulting physician. In the case of screening tests such as the Papanicolaou smear, non-physician cytotechnologists are often employed to perform initial reviews, with only positive or uncertain cases examined by the pathologist. Cytopathology is a board-certifiable subspecialty in the U.S.\n\nMolecular pathology is an emerging discipline within anatomical and clinical pathology that is focused on the use of nucleic acid-based techniques such as in-situ hybridization, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and nucleic acid microarrays for specialized studies of disease in tissues and cells. Molecular pathology shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic and clinical pathology, and is sometimes considered a \"crossover\" discipline.\n\nForensic pathologists receive specialized training in determining the cause of death and other legally relevant information from the bodies of persons who died suddenly with no known medical condition, those who die from non-natural causes, as well as those dying as a result of homicide, or other criminally suspicious deaths. A majority of the forensic pathologists cases are due to natural causes. Often, additional tests such as toxicology, histology, and genetic testing will be used to help the pathologist determine the cause of death. Forensic pathologists will often testify in courts regarding their findings in cases of homicide and suspicious death. They also play a large role in public health, such as investigating deaths in the workplace, deaths in custody, as well as sudden and unexpected deaths in children.\nForensic pathologists often have special areas of interest within their practice, such as sudden death due to cardiac pathology, deaths due to drugs, or Sudden Infant Death (SIDS), and various others.\n\nAnatomical Pathology one of the specialty training programs offered by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA). The RCPA. To qualify as a Fellow of the RCPA in Anatomical Pathology, the candidate must complete a recognised undergraduate or postgraduate medical qualification, then complete a minimum of 1 year of clinical medical experience (internship) as a prerequisite to selection as a training registrar. The training program is a minimum of 5 years, served in at least two laboratories, and candidates must pass a Basic Pathological Sciences examination (usually in first year), the Part 1 examination (not before 3rd year) and the Part 2 examination (not before 5th year). Fellows may then continue into subspecialty training.\n\nAnatomical Pathology (AP) is one of the specialist certificates granted by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Other certificates related to pathology include general pathology (GP), hematopathology, and neuropathology. Candidates for any of these must have completed four years of medical school and five years of residency training.\n\nAnatomic Pathology (AP) is one of the two primary certifications offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is Clinical Pathology (CP)) and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology. To be certified in anatomic pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP or CP. Pathologists' Assistants are highly trained medical professionals with specialized training in Anatomic and Forensic pathology. To become a Pathologists' Assistant one must enter and successfully complete a NAACLS accredited program and pass the ASCP Board of Certification Exam.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "63811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63811", "title": "Kitniyot", "text": "Kitniyot\n\nKitniyot (, \"qitniyyot\") is a Hebrew word meaning legumes. During the Passover holiday, however, the word kitniyot takes on a broader meaning to include grains and seeds such as rice, corn, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans, peas, and lentils, in addition to legumes.\n\nAccording to Orthodox Ashkenazi and some Sephardic customs, Kitniyot may not be eaten during Passover. Although Reform and Conservative Ashkenazi Judaism currently allow for the consumption of Kitniyot during Passover, long-standing tradition in these and other communities is to abstain from their consumption. According to Torat Eretz Yisrael and Minhagei Eretz Yisrael, any Jew worldwide, regardless of origin, and despite the practice of their forefathers, may eat kitniyot on Passover, for it is a practice rejected as an unnecessary precaution by Halachic authorities as early as the time of its emergence.\n\nThe Torah only prohibits Jews from eating chametz during Passover. Chametz is leaven made from the \"five grains\": wheat, spelt, barley, \"shibbolet shu'al\" (two-rowed barley, according to Maimonides; oats according to Rashi) or rye. There are additional rabbinic prohibitions against eating these grains in any form other than matzo.\n\nAmong Orthodox Ashkenazi and some Sephardic Jews, the custom (\"minhag\") during Passover is to refrain from not only products of the five grains but also other grains and legumes. Traditions of what is considered kitniyot vary from community to community but generally include maize (American corn), as well as rice, peas, lentils, and beans. Many also include other legumes, such as peanuts and soy, in this prohibition. The Chayei Adam considers potatoes not to be kitniyot because they were unknown in the time when the prohibition was created, an opinion followed today by nearly all Ashkenazi authorities.\n\nSome Sephardic and Yemenite Jews have not traditionally observed a prohibition on eating kitniyot on Passover, although some groups do abstain from the use of dried pulses during Passover.\n\nSince wheat flour only becomes chametz after it is ground and then mixed with water, one might assume that the kitniyot custom does not forbid kitniyot that were never ground or never came in contact with water. By this logic, it might be permitted to eat fresh kitniyot (like whole beans), or processed kitniyot which never came in contact with water (like certain squeezed oils or toasted solids). In fact, Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu states that Ashkenazim in Israel would eat fresh kitniyot on Pesach until the 1700s, when new Ashkenazi immigrants (the students of the Vilna Gaon and Baal Shem Tov) brought with them the custom not to eat fresh kitniyot. Conservative rabbis have ruled to permit fresh kitniyot.\n\nThe Halakhic argument (the argument according to Jewish law and tradition) against eating kitniyot during Passover originated in early medieval France and Provence and later flourished in high medieval Ashkenazi (Rhineland) Germany.\n\nThe original reasons behind the custom of not eating kitniyot during Passover are not clear, though two common theories are that these items are often made into products resembling chametz (e.g. cornbread), or that these items were normally stored in the same sacks as the five grains and people worried that they might become contaminated with chametz. It is also possible that crop rotation would result in the forbidden chametz grains growing in the same fields, and being mixed in with the kitniyot. Those authorities concerned with these three issues suggested that by avoiding eating kitniyot, people would be better able to avoid chametz. Since Jewish law is quite stringent about the prohibition against chametz in the house during Passover, even in small amounts, a tradition developed to avoid these products altogether.\n\nVilna Gaon (Hagaos HaGra, ibid.) proposes a different source for this custom. The Gemara in Pesachim (40b) notes that Rava objected to the workers of the Exilarch cooking a food called \"chasisi\" on Pesach, since it could to be confused with chametz. Tosafot understand that \"chasisi\" are lentils, and thus, argues Vilna Gaon, establishes the basis for the concern for kitniyot. Rabbi David Golinkin in the Responsa of the Masorati (Conservative) Movement cites Rabbenu Manoah (Provence, ca. 1265) who wrote an opinion in his commentary on Maimonides (Laws of Festivals and Holidays 5:1) that \"It is not proper to eat kitniyot on holidays because it is written that ‘you shall rejoice in your festivals’ and there is no joy in eating dishes made from kitniyot\". Lentils were a food of mourners.\n\nEven where the prohibition against kitniyot was practiced, some poskim opposed it, among them Rabbi Yeruham of 14th century Provence. Others, including Rav Moshe Feinstein did not advocate abandoning the custom, but he opposed expanding the list of forbidden kitniyot \n\nReform Jewish authorities, such as the Responsa Committee of the Reform Jewish Movement for the principal organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada, have also ruled in favor of permitting kitniyot. Reform Judaism first formally permitted eating \"kitniyot\" during Passover in the 19th century.\n\nWhile most Conservative Jews observe the tradition of avoiding \"kitniyot\" during Passover, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, an authoritative body in Conservative Judaism, issued two responsa in December 2015 that said it was now permissible to eat these previously prohibited foods throughout the world. These responsa were based on a 1989 responsa by the Responsa Committee of the Israeli Conservative Movement that permitted Conservative Jews in Israel to eat \"kitniyot\". While eating kitniyot has become more common in Israel, due in large part to the influence of Sephardic Jewish food customs, it is not yet clear whether Conservative Jews in other parts of the world will embrace the new rulings or continue to refrain from kitniyot.\n\nSome Orthodox rabbis, such as David Bar-Hayim at 'Beth HaWaad' beth din of Machon Shilo and Conservative Rabbi David Golinkin of the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies, have argued that the prohibition of \"kitniyot\", while appropriate in Eastern Europe where the Askenazi tradition began, should not apply to the United States or Israel. According to \"The Forward\", some Israelis are choosing a more permissive rabbinical interpretation of kitniyot, which allows for the consumption of a wider range of formerly banned items, and some Ashkenazi Jews in Israel who are married to Sephardic Jews have adopted the Sephardic custom. However, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and other Orthodox organizations still maintain that the prohibition is binding on all Ashenazic Jews worldwide. The Orthodox Union maintains a kitniyot hechsher intended for non-Ashkenazic Jews who consume \"kitniyot\" on Passover.\n\nIn the 1930s, Maxwell House coffee hired the Joseph Jacobs advertising firm in the 1930s to market to a Jewish demographic. The agency hired a rabbi to research coffee, resulting in a determination that the coffee bean is more like a berry than a bean, thus making it kosher for Passover.\n\n"}

It can be used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons, or as a topping for ice cream and custard.\n\nThe process of caramelization consists of heating sugar slowly to around . As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and re-form into compounds with a characteristic color and flavor.\n\nA variety of candies, desserts, and confections are made with caramel: brittles, nougats, pralines, flan, crème brûlée, crème caramel, and caramel apples. Ice creams sometimes are flavored with or contain swirls of caramel.\n\nThe English word comes from French \"caramel\", borrowed from Spanish \"caramelo\" (18th century), itself possibly from Portuguese \"caramel\". Most likely that comes from Late Latin \"calamellus\" 'sugar cane', a diminutive of \"calamus\" 'reed, cane', itself from Greek κάλαμος. Less likely, it comes from a Medieval Latin \"cannamella\", from \"canna\" 'cane' + \"mella\" 'honey'. Finally, some dictionaries connect it to an Arabic \"kora-moħalláh\" 'ball of sweet'.\n\nCaramel sauce is made by mixing caramelized sugar with cream. Depending on the intended application, additional ingredients such as butter, fruit purees, liquors, or vanilla can be used. Caramel sauce is used in a variety of desserts, though most notably as a topping for ice cream. When it is used for crème caramel or flan, it is known as clear caramel and only contains caramelized sugar and water. Butterscotch sauce is made with dark brown sugar, butter, and often a splash of whiskey. Traditionally, butterscotch is a hard candy more in line with a toffee, with the suffix \"scotch\" meaning \"to score\".\n\nToffee, sometimes called \"caramel candy\", is a soft, dense, chewy candy made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), glucose, butter, and vanilla (or vanilla flavoring). The sugar and glucose are heated separately to reach ; the cream and butter are then added which cools the mixture. The mixture is then stirred and reheated until it reaches . Upon completion of cooking, vanilla or any additional flavorings and salt are added. Adding the vanilla or flavorings earlier would result in them burning off at the high temperatures. Adding salt earlier in the process would result in inverting the sugars as they cooked.\n\nAlternatively, all ingredients may be cooked together. In this procedure, the mixture is not heated above the firm ball stage (), so that caramelization of the milk occurs. This temperature is not high enough to caramelize sugar and this type of candy is often called milk caramel or cream caramel.\n\nSalted caramel is a variety of caramel produced in the same way as regular caramel, but with larger amounts of salt added during preparation. Originally utilised in desserts, the confection has seen wide use elsewhere, including in hot chocolate and spirits such as vodka. A study conducted in 2017 by the University of Florida suggested that the popularity of salted caramel is due to its chemical composition, as all of its main ingredients have effects on the reward systems of the human brain, resulting in a process described as \"hedonic escalation\".\n\nCaramel colouring, a dark, bitter liquid, is the highly concentrated product of near total caramelization, used commercially as food and beverage colouring, \"e.g.\", in cola.\n\nCaramelization is the removal of water from a sugar, proceeding to isomerization and polymerization of the sugars into various high-molecular-weight compounds. Compounds such as difructose anhydride may be created from the monosaccharides after water loss. Fragmentation reactions result in low-molecular-weight compounds that may be volatile and may contribute to flavor. Polymerization reactions lead to larger-molecular-weight compounds that contribute to the dark-brown color.\n\nIn modern recipes and in commercial production, glucose (from corn syrup or wheat) or invert sugar is added to prevent crystallization, making up 10%–50% of the sugars by mass. \"Wet caramels\" made by heating sucrose and water instead of sucrose alone produce their own invert sugar due to thermal reaction, but not necessarily enough to prevent crystallization in traditional recipes.\n\nFour and Six Tenths tablespoons (i.e., 69 grams) of commercially prepared butterscotch or caramel topping contain:\n\n"}
{"id": "64088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64088", "title": "Corn syrup", "text": "Corn syrup\n\nCorn syrup is a food syrup which is made from the starch of corn (called maize in some countries) and contains varying amounts of maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup, also known as glucose syrup to confectioners, is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Corn syrup is distinct from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is manufactured from corn syrup by converting a large proportion of its glucose into fructose using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, thus producing a sweeter compound due to higher levels of fructose.\n\nThe more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup in the United States is most commonly made from corn starch. Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch; wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources. \n\nHistorically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then heating the mixture under pressure. The process was invented by the German chemist Gottlieb Kirchhoff in 1812. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step bioprocess. First, the enzyme α-amylase is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. α-amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium genus \"Bacillus\" and the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria were grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into oligosaccharides, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme glucoamylase, known also as \"γ-amylase\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the fungus \"Aspergillus\"; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.\n\nCorn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn. When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1 kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25 kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1 kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524 kg) of corn to produce one short ton.\n\nThe viscosity and sweetness of the syrup depends on the extent to which the hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. To distinguish different grades of syrup, they are rated according to their dextrose equivalent (DE). Most commercially available corn syrups are approximately 1/3 glucose by weight.\n\nTwo common commercial corn syrup products are light and dark corn syrup.\n\nCorn syrup's major uses in commercially prepared foods are as a thickener, a sweetener, and as a humectant – an ingredient that retains moisture and thus maintains a food's freshness. Corn syrup (or HFCS) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \"pancake syrup\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup. \n\nIn the United States, cane sugar quotas raise the price of sugar; hence, domestically produced corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup are less costly alternatives that are often used in American-made processed and mass-produced foods, candies, soft drinks, and fruit drinks.\n\nGlucose syrup was the primary corn sweetener in the United States prior to the expanded use of high fructose corn syrup production. HFCS is a variant in which other enzymes are used to convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is sweeter and more soluble. Corn syrup is also available as a retail product.\n\nIf mixed with sugar, water, and cream of tartar, corn syrup can be used to make sugar glass.\n\n"}
{"id": "64495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64495", "title": "Tamale", "text": "Tamale\n\nA tamale (, ) is a traditional Mesoamerican dish made of masa or dough (starchy, and usually corn-based), which is steamed in a corn husk or banana leaf. The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating, or be used as a plate, the tamale eaten from within. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, chilies or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.\n\nTamales originated in Mesoamerica as early as 8000 to 5000 BC.\n\nThe preparation of tamales is likely to have spread from the indigenous culture in Mexico and Guatemala to the rest of Latin America. According to archaeologists Karl Taube, William Saturn and David Stuart, tamales may date from the year 100 AD. They found pictorial references in the Mural of San Bartolo, in Petén, Guatemala.\n\nThe Aztec and Maya civilizations, as well as the Olmec and Toltec before them, used tamales as easily portable food, for hunting trips, and for traveling large distances, as well as supporting their armies. Tamales were also considered sacred as it is the food of the gods. Aztec, Maya, Olmeca, and Tolteca all considered themselves to be people of corn and so tamales played a large part in their rituals and festivals.\n\n\"Tamale\" comes from the Nahuatl word \"tamalli\" (meaning \"wrapped\") via Spanish where the singular is \"tamal\" and the plural \"tamales\". The word \"tamale\" is a back-formation of \"tamales\", with English speakers assuming the singular was \"tamale\" and the plural \"tamales.\"\n\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the Aztecs ate tamales with these ingredients: turkey, flamingo, frog, \"axolotl\", pocket gopher, rabbit, fish, turkey eggs, honey, fruits, squash and beans, as well as with no filling. Aztec tamales differed from modern tamales by not having added fat.\n\nOne of the most significant rituals for the Aztecs was the feast of Atamalcualiztli (eating of water tamales). This ritual, held every eight years for a whole week, was done by eating tamales without any seasoning, spices, or filling which allowed the maize freedom from being overworked in the usual tamale cooking methods.\n\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the Mayas ate tamales and often served them at feasts and festivals. The Classic Maya hieroglyph for tamales has been identified on pots and other objects dating back to the Classic Era (200–1000 CE), although it is likely they were eaten much earlier. While tortillas are the basis for the contemporary Maya diet, there is remarkably little evidence for tortilla production among the Classic period Maya. A lack of griddles in the archaeological record suggest that the primary foodstuff of the Mesoamerican diet may have been the tamale, a cooked, vegetal-wrapped mass of maize dough. Tamales are cooked without the use of ceramic technologies and are therefore the form of the tamale is thought to predate the tortilla. Similarities between the two maize products can be found in both the ingredients and preparation techniques and the linguistic ambiguity exhibited by the pan-Mayan term \"wa\" referring to a basic, daily consumed maize product that can refer to either tortillas or tamales.\n\nIn Mexico, tamales begin with a dough made from nixtamalized corn (hominy), called \"masa\", or a \"masa\" mix, such as Maseca, and lard or vegetable shortening. Tamales are generally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves before being steamed, depending on the region from which they come. They usually have a sweet or savory filling and are usually steamed until firm.\n\nTamale-making is a ritual that has been part of Mexican life since pre-Hispanic times, when special fillings and forms were designated for each specific festival or life event. Today, tamales are typically filled with meats, cheese or vegetables, especially chilies. Preparation is complex, time-consuming and an excellent example of Mexican communal cooking, where this task usually falls to the women. Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot \"atole\" or \"champurrado\" and \"arroz con leche\" (rice porridge, lit. rice with milk) or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin. Street vendors can be seen serving them from huge, steaming, covered pots (\"tamaleras\") or \"ollas\".\n\nThe most common fillings are pork and chicken, in either red or green \"salsa\" or \"mole\". Another traditional variation is to add pink-colored sugar to the corn mix and fill it with raisins or other dried fruit and make a sweet \"tamal de dulce\". Commonly, a few \"deaf\", or fillingless, tamales (\"tamales sordos\"), might be served with refried beans and coffee. Most recently the roasted pepper and Monterey Jack cheese (chile con queso) tamales have become a favorite recipe.\n\nThe cooking of tamales is traditionally done in batches of tens or sometimes hundreds, and the ratio of filling to dough (and the coarseness of the filling) is a matter of preference. In the North, after boiling, tamales are sometimes fried before serving, to give them a crunchy crust. In Michoacán (a Pacific coast state), a corunda is a tamale served bathed in sauce, cream, and salty cheese.\n\nInstead of corn husks, banana or plantain leaves are used in tropical parts of the country, such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, and the Yucatán Peninsula. These tamales are rather square in shape, often very large—15 inches (40 cm)—and these larger tamales are commonly known as \"pibs\" in the Yucatán Peninsula. Another very large type of tamale is \"zacahuil\", made in the Huasteca region of Mexico. Depending on the size, \"zacahuil\" can feed anywhere between 50 and 200 people; they are made during festivals and holidays, for quinceañeras, and on Sundays to be sold at the markets. Another less-common variation is to use chard or avocado leaves, which can be eaten along with the filling.\n\nTamales became one of the representatives of Mexican culinary tradition in Europe, being one of the first samples of the culture the Spanish conquistadors took back to Spain as proof of civilization, according to Fray Juan de Zumárraga.\n\nTamales are usually eaten during festivities such as Christmas, the Day of the Dead, Las Posadas, La Candelaria Day (February 2) and Mexican Independence Day.\n\nIn Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, tamales are also wrapped in plantain leaves. The dough is usually made from dent corn, not sweet corn.\n\nIn Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras, tamales without filling are served as the bread or starch portion of a meal:\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays, tamales made with corn flour are a special treat for Guatemalans and Hondurans. The preparation time of this type of tamale is long, due to the amount of time required to cook down and thicken the flour base.\n\nGuatemalan cuisine is known in particular for its hundreds of varieties of tamales; some popular ones include \"tamales de gallina\" (chicken), \"tamales dulces\" (sweet), and \"tamales de elote\" (in Costa Rica, this name can also refer to a type of corn pastry). In Guatemala, a variety of tamales is called \"tamales colorados\", which have chicken or pork filling and a tomato-based sauce (\"recado\"), hence the \"colorado\", which means 'to blush'. \"Tamales colorados\" may also contain olives, red bell pepper, prunes or raisins, capers, and almonds.\n\nThe tamale is a staple in Belize, where it is also known by the Spanish name \"bollo\" or \"dukunu\", a green corn tamale.\n\nNicaragua has a large form known as \"nacatamales.\" Unlike other tamale recipes, the meat is added raw and cooked in the dough.\n\nIn Panama, where they are considered one of the main national dishes, tamales are fairly large. The most common fillings are chicken, raisins, onions, tomato sauce, and sometimes sweet peas. Pork is also used. Another variation is \"tamal en olla\", or tamal in pot, which simply is the tamale mixture, not wrapped in either plantain or banana leaves, and served directly from the pot onto plates. Tamales are usually served for all special occasions, including weddings and birthday parties, and are always found on the Christmas dinner table.\n\nTamales in Costa Rica vary according to region and season. One sort of tamales, \"tamales mudos\" (mute tamales) is a tamale with no filling. Sweet tamales are popular during Holy Week. Tamales can be bought year-round, but the best tamales are, of course, home-made and not store-bought. It is a Christmas tradition in many families to gather and make dozens of tamales. They are wrapped in banana or plantain leaves, and then two are tied together with twine or string to keep water from seeping into the leaves. This pair is called a \"piña\". Tamales are typically served on the inner leaf wrapping with Salsa Lizano, a locally prepared Worcestershire-type sauce.\n\nOne version of tamales, called \"humita\", is found in Argentine Northwest , Colombia, partes of Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru. It can be either savoury or sweet. Sweet ones have raisins, vanilla, oil, and sugar; salty ones can be filled with cheese (\"queso fresco\") or chicken.\n\nTamales are found in northwestern Argentina (the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Catamarca and Tucumán). \"Tamales salteños\" are made with shredded meat of a boiled lamb or pork head, and corn flour wrapped in \"chalas\". \"Tamales jujeños\" use minced meat, corn and red peppers.\n\nEcuadorian \"humitas\" can be filled with fresh cheese, pork, chicken or raisins, and they are usually wrapped in corn husk or \"achira\" (canna) leaves. \"Humitas\" are cooked in the oven or in the \"pachamanca\". They are not tamales by Peruvian standards. In Chile, the food known as \"humitas\" is almost identical to \"tamales\".\n\nIn Peru and Bolivia the tamales tend to be spicy, large and wrapped in banana leaves. In Lima, common fillings are chicken or pork, usually accompanied by boiled eggs, olives, peanuts or a piece of chili pepper. In other cities, tamales are smaller, wrapped in corn husks and use white instead of yellow corn.\n\nIn Brazil, a similar food is called \"pamonha\", but is more similar to the humita than the tamale, and has different origins.\n\nIn Venezuela, another variant similar to tamale is called \"hallaca\", which is also a popular dish in Ecuador. They are wrapped in plantain leaves and filled with a stew that may contain beef, chicken, pork, almonds, raisins and olives. They are traditionally eaten for Christmas. Also, the Venezuelan \"bollos\" are similar to tamales, wrapped in corn husks, filled with hot peppers or plain, and eaten as a side dish.\n\nIn Colombia, they are wrapped in plantain leaves. The several varieties include the most widely known \"tolimense\", as well as \"boyacense\" and \"santandereano\". Like other South American varieties, the most common are very large compared to Mexican tamales — about the size of a softball — and the dough is softer and wetter, with a bright yellow color. A \"tamal tolimense\" is served for breakfast with hot chocolate, and may contain large pieces of cooked carrot or other vegetables, whole corn kernels, rice, chicken on the bone and/or chunks of pork. Related foods are the \"envuelto\" and \"bollo limpio\" which are made of corn, cooked in a corn husk, and resemble a Mexican tamale more closely but have simpler fillings or no filling at all for they are often served to accompany various foods, and the \"bollo de yuca\" made of yuca flour, also cooked in a corn husk, eaten with butifarra and sour milk (known in the country as \"suero costeño\").\n\nIn Cuba, before the 1959 Revolution, street vendors sold Mexican-style tamales wrapped in corn husks, usually made without any kind of spicy seasoning. Cuban tamales being identical in form to those made in Mexico City suggests they were brought over to Cuba during the period of intense cultural and musical exchange between Cuba and Mexico, between the 1920s and 2000s.\n\nA well-known Cuban song from the 1950s, \"\"Los Tamalitos de Olga\"\", (a cha-cha-cha sung by Orquesta Aragón) celebrated the delicious tamales sold by a street vendor in Cienfuegos. A peculiarly Cuban invention is the dish known as \"tamal en cazuela\", basically consisting of tamale masa with the meat stuffing stirred into the masa, then cooked in a pot on the stove to form a kind of hearty cornmeal porridge.\n\nIn Dominican Republic, they are called \"pasteles en hoja\", and they are traditionally (but not exclusively) eaten for Christmas. The dough is usually made from plantains, although sometimes cassava is used as well; the meat filling is typically ground beef, but chicken and pork is also common. They are wrapped in plantain leaves, bound with twine, and steamed. In Santo Domingo, some eateries sell them, as well as street vendors. They are especially popular in the nearby city of San Cristobal.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, it is called a \"pastelle\" and is associated almost entirely with Christmas. Raisins and capers along with other seasonings are added to the meat filling. The entire thing is wrapped in a banana leaf, bound with twine and steamed. The sweet version is called \"paymee\".\n\nOn Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba, it is called \"Ayaka\" in Papiamento. The name is derived from the Venezuelan \"Hallaca\". It is usually eaten with Christmas. They are made with corn meal and there are different kinds of filling, usually consisting of a tomato based sauce with meat such as chicken, tuna or beef. Fruits, nuts, capers, olives, etc. can be added depending on family recipes and kind of meat used. The Ayakas are usually wrapped in banana leaves.\n\nTamales have been eaten in the United States since at least 1893, when they were featured at the World's Columbian Exposition. A tradition of roving tamale sellers was documented in early 20th-century blues music. They are the subject of the well-known 1937 blues/ragtime song \"They're Red Hot\" by Robert Johnson.\n\nWhile Mexican-style and other Latin American-style tamales are featured at ethnic restaurants throughout the United States, there are also some distinctly indigenous styles.\n\nChoctaw and Chickasaw make a dish called Banaha which can be stuffed or not (plain) usually the filling (range from none, fried bacon, turkey, deer, nuts, and vegetables like onions, potatoes, squash, and sweet potatoes) can either be filled or mixed with the masa and steamed in a corn shuck.\n\nCherokee tamales, also known as bean bread or \"broadswords\", were made with hominy (in the case of the Cherokee, the masa was made from corn boiled in water treated with wood ashes instead of lime) and beans, and wrapped in green corn leaves or large tree leaves and boiled, similar to the meatless pre-Columbian bean and masa tamales still prepared in Chiapas, central Mexico, and Guatemala.\n\nIn the Mississippi Delta, African Americans developed a spicy tamale made from cornmeal (rather than masa), which is boiled in corn husks. In northern Louisiana, tamales have been made for several centuries. The Spanish established presidio Los Adaes in 1721 in modern-day Robeline, Louisiana. The descendants of these Spanish settlers from central Mexico were the first tamale makers to arrive in the eastern US. Zwolle, Louisiana, has a Tamale Fiesta every year in October.\n\nIn Chicago, unique tamales made from machine-extruded cornmeal wrapped in paper are sold at Chicago-style hot dog stands.\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, the name \"tamale pie\" was given to meat pies and casseroles made with a cornmeal crust and typical tamale fillings arranged in layers. Although characterized as Mexican food, these forms are not popular in Mexican American culture in which the individually wrapped style is preferred.\n\nThe Indio International Tamale Festival held every December in Indio, California has earned two Guinness World Records: the largest tamale festival (120,000 in attendance, Dec. 2–3, 2000) and the world's largest tamale, over 1 foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 40 feet (12.2 m) in length, created by Chef John Sedlar. The 2006 Guinness book calls the festival \"the world's largest cooking and culinary festival.\"\n\nIn the Philippines and Guam, which were governed by Spain as a province of Mexico, different forms of \"tamales\" exist. Some are made with a dough derived from ground rice and are filled with seasoned chicken or pork with the addition of peanuts and other seasonings such as sugar. In some places, such as the Pampanga and Batangas provinces, the tamales are wrapped in banana leaves, but sweet corn varieties from the Visayas region are wrapped in corn husks similar to the sweet corn tamales of the American Southwest and Mexico. Because of the work involved in the preparation of tamales, they usually only appear during the special holidays or other big celebrations. Various \"tamal\" recipes have practically disappeared under the pressures of modern life and the ease of fast food. Several varieties of tamales are also found in the Philippines. Tamales, tamalis, tamalos, pasteles, are different varieties found throughout the region. Some are sweet, some are savory, and some are sweet and savory. Mostly wrapped in banana leaves and made of rice, either the whole grain or ground and cooked with coconut milk and other seasonings, they are sometimes filled with meat and seafood, or are plain and have no filling. There are certain varieties, such as tamalos, that are made of a sweet corn masa wrapped in a corn husk or leaf. There are also varieties made without masa, like tamalis, which are made with small fish fry wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, similar to the tamales de charal from Mexico, where the small fish are cooked whole with herbs and seasonings wrapped inside a corn husk without masa. The number of varieties have unfortunately dwindled through the years so certain types of tamales that were once popular in the Philippines have become lost or are simply memories. The variety found in Guam, known as \"tamales guiso\", is made with corn masa and wrapped in corn husks, and as with the Philippine tamales, are clear evidence of the influence of the galleon trade that occurred between the ports of Manila and Acapulco.\n"}
{"id": "65330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65330", "title": "Infant formula", "text": "Infant formula\n\nInfant formula, baby formula or just formula (American English) or baby milk, infant milk or first milk (British English), is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding to babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as \"a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants by reason of its simulation of human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk\".\n\nManufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins. An upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.\n\nA 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their \"Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding\", which restated that \"processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission\", and also warned that \"lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality\". \n\nIn particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. A formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with \"Cronobacter sakazakii\" and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. Although \"C. sakazakii\" can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of \"E. sakazakii\" infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported.\n\nThe use and marketing of infant formula has come under scrutiny. Breastfeeding, including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, is widely advocated as \"ideal\" for babies and infants, both by health authorities — and accordingly in ethical advertising of infant formula manufacturers.\n\nDespite the recommendation that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, less than 40% of infants below this age are exclusively breastfed worldwide. The overwhelming majority of American babies are not exclusively breastfed for this period – in 2005 under 12% of babies were breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, with over 60% of babies of 2 months of age being fed formula, and approximately one in four breastfed infants having infant formula feeding within two days of birth.\n\nSome studies have shown that use of formula can vary according to the parents' socio-economic status, ethnicity or other characteristics. For example, according to a research conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 82.9% of mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, but the number differed between Caucasians (91.6%) and non-Caucasians (56.8%), with the difference essentially attributed to marital status, education and family income. In the United States, mothers of lower socio-economic status have been found less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.\n\nThe use of hydrolysed cow milk baby formula versus standard milk baby formula does not appear to change the risk of allergies or autoimmune diseases.\n\nIn some cases, breastfeeding is medically contraindicated. These include:\n\nUse of infant formula has been cited for numerous increased health risks. Studies have found infants in developed countries who consume formula are at increased risk for acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), eczema and necrotizing enterocolitis when compared to infants who are breastfed. Some studies have found an association between infant formula and lower cognitive development, including iron supplementation in baby formula being linked to lowered I.Q. and other neurodevelopmental delays; however other studies have found no correlation.\n\nIn 2008, a case of melamine poisoning of infant formula was discovered in China, where milk was deliberately adulterated with the chemical, leading to the death of six babies, and illnesses in more than 300,000 infants, including cases of acute kidney failure. Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels. Some of those responsible for the poisoning were sentenced to death.\n\nIn November 2008, traces of melamine were reported to have been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firms — Abbott Laboratories, Nestlé and Mead Johnson — responsible for 90–99% of the infant formula market in that country. The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The safety data sheet for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161 mg/kg for a rat.\n\nHealth Canada conducted a separate test and also detected traces of melamine in infant formula available in Canada. The melamine levels were well below Health Canada's safety limits, although concerns remain about the safety of manufactured food for infants and monitoring of potentially dangerous substances.\n\n\nInfant formulas come in powder, liquid concentrate, and ready-to-feed forms. They are designed to be prepared by the parent or caregiver in small batches and fed to the infant, usually with either a cup or a baby bottle.\n\nInfant formulas come in a variety of types:\n\nManufacturers and health officials advise it is very important to measure powders or concentrates accurately to achieve the intended final product concentration; otherwise, the child will be malnourished. It is advisable that all equipment that comes into contact with the infant formula be cleaned and sterilized before each use. Proper refrigeration is essential for any infant formula which is prepared in advance.\n\nIn developing countries, formula is frequently prepared improperly, resulting in high infant mortality due to malnutrition and diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. This is due to lack of clean water, lack of sterile conditions, lack of refrigeration, illiteracy (so written instructions cannot be followed), poverty (diluting formula so that it lasts longer), and lack of education of mothers by formula distributors. These problems and resulting disease and death are a key factor in opposition to the marketing and distribution of infant formula in developing countries by numerous public health agencies and NGOs (discussed in more detail at Nestlé boycott and International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes).\n\nBesides breast milk, infant formula is the only other milk product which the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable for infants under the age of one year (as opposed to cow's milk, goat's milk, or follow-on formula). Supplementing with solid food in addition to breast milk or formula begins during weaning, and most babies begin supplementing about the time their first teeth appear, usually around the age of six months.\n\nAlthough cow's milk is the basis of almost all infant formula, plain cow's milk is unsuited for infants because of its high casein content and low whey content, and untreated cow's milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition. To reduce the negative effect on the infant's digestive system, cow's milk used for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes steps to make protein more easily digestible and alter the whey-to-casein protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called \"fortification\", see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.\n\nThe nutrient content of infant formula for sale in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. The following must be included in all formulas produced in the U.S.:\n\nOther commonly used ingredients:\n\nThe policy, regulatory and industry environments surrounding the infant formula market vary tremendously between countries.\n\nThe International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is an international health policy framework adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 1981 regarding infant formula marketing, including strict restrictions on advertising. Its implementation depends on the laws of different countries and the behavior of infant formula manufacturers – the code has no power itself. Legislation and corporate behavior vary significantly between countries: at least 84 countries have enacted national legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code and 14 countries have draft laws awaiting adoption; whereas elsewhere neither the Code nor its principles are followed by governments or formula manufacturers.\n\nPractices that are banned in the Code include most advertising, claiming health benefits for formula, and giving free samples to women able to breastfeed – this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula. In many countries free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice.\n\nInfant formula is one of the top three consumer commodities in the Philippines, and among the most imported products. Annual sales amount to some US$469 million annually. US$88 million is spent on advertising the product.\n\nInfant formula marketing has been regulated since the 1987 Executive Order 51 or \"Milk Code\", which regulated, but did not ban, practices such as advertising and providing free samples. Shortly after it was enacted, Wyeth introduced \"follow-on formula\", which was not in the purview of the Milk Code which predated its market entry.\n\nIn 2006, the Department of Health banned the advertising of infant formula and the practice of providing free samples, regardless of intended age group (in the \"Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations\" of Executive Order 51, or RIRR). The new regulation was challenged by the infant formula industry in the Supreme Court. Initially the challenge was dismissed, but this decision was reversed following industry pressure and a controversial letter by American business leader Thomas Donahue, then President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, resulting in the regulation being suspended and advertising continuing.\n\"The Guardian\" newspaper reports widespread illegal advertising and marketing of formula milk contrary to World Health Organization guidelines. Doctors and midwives are encouraged to promote feeding babies formula milk, advertising also targets mothers directly. Babies get sick and sometimes die because poor mothers cannot sterilize bottles.\n\nIn South Africa, there is a move towards plain packaging of infant formula under R 991 of the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act; as of 6 December 2013, Regulation 7 (Sale and Promotion) is force, whereas Regulations 2-6 (primarily with respect to labelling) are scheduled to come into force on 6 December 2014.\nOne of the key requirements as per Regulation 3.1.A.iii is a conspicuous message stating “[t]his product shall only be used on the advice of a health professional”.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, infant formula advertising has been restricted since 1995; advertising for \"follow-on formula\" is legal, which has been cited as a loophole allowing advertising of similarly-packaged formula.\n\nIn the United States, infant formula is both heavily marketed – the country has not adopted the Code, nor is it being systematically implemented by manufacturers for domestic marketing – and even heavily subsidized by the government: at least one third of the American market is supported by the government, with over half of infant formula sold in the country provided through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (known as WIC).\n\nAccording to surveys, over 70% of large U.S. hospitals dispense infant formula to all infants, a practice opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and in violation of the Code. The Gerber Products Company began marketing its brand of infant formula directly to the public in October 1989, while the Carnation Company began marketing \"Good Start\" infant formula directly to the public in January 1991.\n\nInfant formula costs are a significant fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate. Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states. Meanwhile, breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients; this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to mothers in the WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status. Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants. In recent years WIC has been expanding its breastfeeding promotion strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use milk banks.\n\nIn 1865, the first infant food was invented.\nThroughout history, mothers who could not breastfeed their babies either employed a wet nurse or, less frequently, prepared food for their babies, a process known as \"dry nursing\". Baby food composition varied according to region and economic status. In Europe and North America during the early 19th century, the prevalence of wet nursing began to decrease, while the practice of feeding babies mixtures based on animal milk rose in popularity. This trend was driven by cultural changes as well as increased sanitation measures, and it continued throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, with a notable increase after Elijah Pratt invented and patented the India-rubber nipple in 1845. As early as 1846, scientists and nutritionists noted an increase in medical problems and infant mortality was associated with dry nursing. In an attempt to improve the quality of manufactured baby foods, in 1867, Justus von Liebig developed the world's first commercial infant formula, \"Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies\". The success of this product quickly gave rise to competitors such as Mellin's Food, Ridge's Food for Infants and Nestlé's Milk.\n\nAs physicians became increasingly concerned about the quality of such foods, medical recommendations such as Thomas Morgan Rotch's \"percentage method\" (published in 1890) began to be distributed, and gained widespread popularity by 1907. These complex formulas recommended that parents mix cow's milk, water, cream, and sugar or honey in specific ratios to achieve the nutritional balance believed to approximate human milk reformulated in such a way as to accommodate the believed digestive capability of the infant.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century in the United States, most infants were breastfed, although many received some formula feeding as well. Home-made \"percentage method\" formulas were more commonly used than commercial formulas in both Europe and the United States. They were less expensive and were widely believed to be healthier. However, formula-fed babies exhibited more diet-associated medical problems, such as scurvy, rickets and bacterial infections than breastfed babies. By 1920, the incidence of scurvy and rickets in formula-fed babies had greatly decreased through the addition of orange juice and cod liver oil to home-made formulas. Bacterial infections associated with formula remained a problem more prevalent in the United States than in Europe, where milk was usually boiled prior to use in formulas.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, evaporated milk began to be widely commercially available at low prices, and several clinical studies suggested that babies fed evaporated milk formula thrive as well as breastfed babies\n\nThese findings are not supported by modern research. These studies, accompanied by the affordable price of evaporated milk and the availability of the home icebox initiated a tremendous rise in the use of evaporated milk formulas. By the late 1930s, the use of evaporated milk formulas in the United States surpassed all commercial formulas, and by 1950 over half of all babies in the United States were reared on such formulas.\n\nIn parallel with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition. Maltose and dextrins were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the Mead Johnson Company released a milk additive called \"Dextri-Maltose\". This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, milkfats were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats as part of the continued drive to closer simulate human milk. This formula was called SMA for \"simulated milk adapted.\"\n\nIn the late 1920s, Alfred Bosworth released \"Similac\" (for \"similar to lactation\"), and Mead Johnson released \"Sobee\". Several other formulas were released over the next few decades, but commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with evaporated milk formulas until the 1950s. The reformulation and concentration of Similac in 1951, and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for \"infant meal\") in 1959 were accompanied by marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians. By the early 1960s, commercial formulas were more commonly used than evaporated milk formulas in the United States, which all but vanished in the 1970s. By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.\n\nWhen birth rates in industrial nations tapered off during the 1960s, infant formula companies heightened marketing campaigns in non-industrialized countries. Unfortunately, poor sanitation led to steeply increased mortality rates among infants fed formula prepared with contaminated (drinking) water. Additionally, low-income families may over-dilute in an effort to \"stretch\" supplies resulting in malnourishment for the infant. Organized protests, the most famous of which was the Nestlé boycott of 1977, called for an end to unethical marketing. This boycott is ongoing, as the current coordinators maintain that Nestlé engages in marketing practices which violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.\n\nIn addition to commercially marketed brands, generic brands (or store brands) of infant formula were introduced in the United States in 1997, first by PBM Products. These private label formulas are sold by many leading food and drug retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, Loblaws, and Walgreens. All infant formula brands in the United States are required to adhere to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. As reported by the Mayo Clinic: “as with most consumer products, brand-name infant formulas cost more than generic brands. But that doesn't mean that brand-name [Similac, Nestle, Enfamil] formulas are better. Although manufacturers may vary somewhat in their formula recipes, the FDA requires that all formulas contain the same nutrient density.”\n\nSimilarly, in Canada all infant formulas regardless of brand are required to meet standards set by Health Canada.\n\nFollow-on or toddler formulas are sold for ages 6 months to 2 years, (when infants are typically breastfed) and are not nutritionally complete nor subject to the same regulations as infant formula. Critics have argued that follow-on and toddler formulas were introduced to circumvent the regulations regarding infant formula and have resulted in confusing advertising.\n\nAn early example of follow-on formula was introduced by Wyeth in the Philippines in 1987, following the introduction in this country of regulations on infant formula advertising, but which did not address follow-on formulas (products that did not exist at the time of their drafting). Similarly, while infant formula advertising is illegal in the United Kingdom, follow-on formula advertising is legal, and the similar packaging and market results in follow-on advertisements frequently being interpreted as advertisements for formula. (See also industry and marketing, below.)\n\nThese products have also recently fallen under criticism for contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic in some developed countries due to their marketing and flavoring practices.\n\nSince the early 1970s, industrial countries have witnessed a resurgence in breastfeeding among newborns and infants to 6 months of age. This upswing in breastfeeding has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of other foods (such as cow's milk), resulting in increased use of both breastfeeding and infant formula between the ages of 3–12 months.\n\nThe global infant formula market has been estimated at $7.9 billion, with North America and Western Europe accounting for 33% of the market and considered largely saturated, and Asia representing 53% of the market. South East Asia is a particularly large fraction of the world market relative to its population. Infant formula is the largest segment of the baby food market, with the fraction given as between 40% and 70%.\n\nLeading health organizations (e.g. WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Department of Health and Human Services) are attempting to reduce the use of infant formula and increase the prevalence of breastfeeding from birth through 12 to 24 months of age through public health awareness campaigns. The specific goals and approaches of these breastfeeding promotion programs, and the policy environment surrounding their implementation, vary by country. As a policy basic framework, the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, adopted by the WHO's World Health Assembly in 1981, requires infant formula companies to preface their product information with statements that breastfeeding is the best way of feeding babies and that a substitute should only be used after consultation with health professionals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative also restricts use by hospitals of free formula or other infant care aids provided by formula companies. (See also Policy section below.)\n\nThe manufacturing process may differ for different types of formula made; therefore the following is the general procedure for liquid-milk based formulas:\n\nPrimary ingredients are blended in large stainless steel tanks and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60 °C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to pasteurization equipment when mixing is complete.\n\nThis is a process that protects against spoilage by eliminating bacteria, yeasts and molds.\nIt involves quickly heating and then cooling of the product under controlled conditions which micro-organisms cannot survive. The batch is held at around 85–94 °C for approximately 30 seconds which is necessary to adequately reduce micro-organisms and prepare the formula for filling.\n\nThis is a process which increases emulsion uniformity and stability by reducing size of fat and oil particles in the formula. It is done with a variety of mixing equipment that applies shear to the product and this mixing breaks fat and oil particles into very small droplets.\n\nStandardization is used to ensure that the key parameters like pH, fat concentration and vitamins and mineral content are correct. If insufficient levels of these are found, the batch is reworked to achieve appropriate levels. After this step, the batch is ready to be packaged.\n\nPackaging depends on manufacturer and type of equipment used, but in general, liquid formula is filled into metal cans with lids crimped into place.\n\nFinally, infant formulas are heat treated to maintain the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118 °C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142 °C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.\n\nRecently, probiotics have become a new ingredient in many of our foods, and studies have been completed regarding the use of probiotics in infant formula Several randomized, controlled trials completed recently have shown limited and short term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants’ diet The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe. Therefore, the study suggested more scientific research is necessary before a conclusion can be made about probiotic supplementation in infant formula, since the research is still quite preliminary.\n\nPrebiotics are undigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed to be an important factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of variety, variability, complexity and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human milk in a strictly structural fashion.\n\nThe European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found evidence to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased in the number of bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no evidence to support major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.\n\nLysozyme is an enzyme that is responsible for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. Lactoferrin is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow’s milk has a signifactly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them into infant formulas.\n\n\n"}

Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in the Edo period (1600–1878) and following Confucian texts, while also being influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, allowing the violent existence of the \"samurai\" to be tempered by wisdom, patience and serenity. \"Bushidō\" developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century, although some scholars have noted that the term \"bushidō\" itself is \"rarely attested in pre-modern literature\".\n\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, some aspects of warrior values became formalized into Japanese feudal law.\n\nThe word \"bushidō\" was first used in Japan during the 17th century in Kōyō Gunkan, but did not come into common usage until after the 1899 publication of Nitobe Inazō's \"\". In \"Bushido\" (1899), Nitobe wrote:\n\nBushidō, then, is the code of moral principles which the samurai were required or instructed to observe ... More frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten ... It was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career. In order to become a samurai this code has to be mastered.\n\nNitobe was the first to document Japanese chivalry in this way. In \"Feudal and Modern Japan\" (1896), historian Arthur May Knapp wrote:\n\nThe samurai of thirty years ago had behind him a thousand years of training in the law of honor, obedience, duty, and self-sacrifice ... It was not needed to create or establish them. As a child he had but to be instructed, as indeed he was from his earliest years, in the etiquette of self-immolation.\n\nMany early literary works of Japan talk of warriors, but the term \"bushidō\" does not appear in text until the Edo period.\n\nFrom the literature of the 13th to 16th centuries, there exists an abundance of references to military ideals, although none of these should be viewed as early versions of \"bushidō\" per se. Carl Steenstrup noted that 13th- and 14th-century writings (\"gunki monogatari\") \"portrayed the \"bushi\" in their natural element, war, eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man\".\n\nCompiled over the course of three centuries, beginning in the 1180s, the \"Heike Monogatari\" depicts a highly fictionalized and idealized story of a struggle between two warrior clans, the Minamoto and the Taira, at the end of the 12th century—a conflict known as the Genpei War. Clearly depicted throughout the epic is the ideal of the cultivated warrior. The warriors in the \"Heike Monogatari\" served as role models for the educated warriors of later generations, although the ideals depicted by them were assumed to be beyond reach. Nevertheless, during the early modern era, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. The influence of Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism in the Bushido's early development instilled among those who live by the code a religious respect for it. Yamaga-Soko, the Japanese philosopher given credit for establishing Bushido, said that \"the first and surest means to enter into communion with the Divine is by sincerity.\" \n\nThe sayings of Sengoku-period retainers and warlords such as Katō Kiyomasa and Nabeshima Naoshige were generally recorded or passed down to posterity around the turn of the 16th century when Japan had entered a period of relative peace. In a handbook addressed to \"all \"samurai\", regardless of rank\", Katō states:\n\nKatō was a ferocious warrior who banned even recitation of poetry, stating:\n\nNaoshige says similarly, that it is shameful for any man to die without having risked his life in battle, regardless of rank, and that \"\"bushidō\" is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man\". However, Naoshige also suggests that \"everyone should personally know exertion as it is known in the lower classes\".\n\nJapan enjoyed a period of relative peace from 1600 to the mid-19th century. During this period, the \"samurai\" class played a central role in the policing and administration of the country. The \"bushidō\" literature of this time contains much thought relevant to a warrior class seeking more general application of martial principles and experience in peacetime, as well as reflection on the land's long history of war. The literature of this time includes:\n\n\nThe \"Hagakure\" contains many sayings attributed to Sengoku-period retainer Nabeshima Naoshige (1537–1619) regarding \"bushidō\" related philosophy early in the 18th century by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659–1719), a former retainer to Naoshige's grandson, Nabeshima Mitsushige. The Hagakure was compiled in the early 18th century, but was kept as a kind of \"secret teaching\" of the Nabeshima clan until the end of the Tokugawa \"bakufu\" (1867). His saying, \"I have found the way of the warrior is death\", was a summation of the focus on honour and reputation over all else that \"bushidō\" codified.\n\nTokugawa-era rōnin, scholar and strategist Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685) wrote extensively on matters relating to \"bushidō\", \"bukyō\" (a \"warrior's creed\"), and a more general \"shidō\", a \"way of gentlemen\" intended for application to all stations of society. Sokō attempts to codify a kind of \"universal \"bushidō\"\" with a special emphasis on \"pure\" Confucian values, (rejecting the mystical influences of Tao and Buddhism in Neo-Confucian orthodoxy), while at the same time calling for recognition of the singular and divine nature of Japan and Japanese culture. These radical concepts—including ultimate devotion to the Emperor, regardless of rank or clan—put him at odds with the reigning shogunate. He was exiled to the Akō domain, (the future setting of the 47 Rōnin incident), and his works were not widely read until the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century.\n\nThe aging Yamamoto Tsunetomo's interpretation of \"bushidō\" is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience, at once dutiful and defiant, ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society. Of the 47 \"rōnin\"—to this day, generally regarded as exemplars of \"bushidō\"—Tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily, delayed plot for revenge, and had been over-concerned with the success of their undertaking. Instead, Tsunetomo felt true \"samurai\" should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties, without regard for success or failure.\n\nThis romantic sentiment is of course expressed by warriors throughout history, though it may run counter to the art of war itself. This ambivalence is found in the heart of \"bushidō\", and perhaps all such \"warrior codes\". Some combination of traditional \"bushidō\"'s organic contradictions and more \"universal\" or \"progressive\" formulations (like those of Yamaga Sokō) would inform Japan's disastrous military ambitions in the 20th century.\n\nRecent scholarship in both Japan and abroad has focused on differences between the \"samurai\" caste and the \"bushidō\" theories that developed in modern Japan. \"Bushidō\" in the prewar period was often emperor-centered and placed much greater value on the virtues of loyalty and self-sacrifice than did many Tokugawa-era interpretations. \"Bushidō\" was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs. Scholars of Japanese history agree that the \"bushidō\" that spread throughout modern Japan was not simply a continuation of earlier traditions.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that modern \"bushidō\" discourse originated in the 1880s as a response to foreign stimuli, such as the English concept of \"gentlemanship\", by Japanese with considerable exposure to Western culture. Nitobe Inazo's \"bushidō\" interpretations followed a similar trajectory, although he was following earlier trends. This relatively pacifistic \"bushidō\" was then hijacked and adapted by militarists and the government from the early 1900s onward as nationalism increased around the time of the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nThe \"junshi\" suicide of General Nogi Maresuke and his wife on the death of Emperor Meiji occasioned both praise, as an example to the decaying morals of Japan, and criticism, explicitly declaring that the spirit of \"bushidō\" thus exemplified should not be revived.\n\nDuring pre-World War II and World War II Shōwa Japan, \"bushido\" was pressed into use for militarism, to present war as purifying, and death a duty. This was presented as revitalizing traditional values and \"transcending the modern\". \"Bushidō\" would provide a spiritual shield to let soldiers fight to the end. As the war turned, the spirit of \"bushidō\" was invoked to urge that all depended on the firm and united soul of the nation. When the Battle of Attu was lost, attempts were made to make the more than two thousand Japanese deaths an inspirational epic for the fighting spirit of the nation. Arguments that the plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to \"bloom as flowers of death\". The first proposals of organized suicide attacks met resistance because although \"bushidō\" called for a warrior to be always aware of death, they were not to view it as the sole end. Nonetheless, the desperate straits brought about acceptance and such attacks were acclaimed as the true spirit of \"bushidō\".\n\nJapanese propaganda during the World War II claimed that prisoners of war denied being mistreated and declared that they were being well-treated by virtue of \"bushidō\" generosity. Broadcast interviews with prisoners were also described as being not propaganda but out of sympathy with the enemy, such sympathy as only \"bushidō\" could inspire.\n\n\"Bushidō\" expanded and formalized the earlier code of the \"samurai\", and stressed sincerity, frugality, loyalty, mastery of martial arts, and honour to the death. Under the \"bushidō\" ideal, if a \"samurai\" failed to uphold his honor he could only regain it by performing \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide).\n\nIn an excerpt from his book \"Samurai: The World of the Warrior\", historian Stephen Turnbull describes the role of seppuku in feudal Japan:\n\nIn the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai’s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.\n\n\"Bushidō\" varied dramatically over time, and across the geographic and socio-economic backgrounds of the \"samurai\", who represented somewhere between 5% and 10% of the Japanese population. The first Meiji-era census at the end of the 19th century counted 1,282,000 members of the \"high \"samurai\"\", allowed to ride a horse, and 492,000 members of the \"low samurai\", allowed to wear two swords but not to ride a horse, in a country of about 25 million.\n\nSome versions of \"bushidō\" include compassion for those of lower station, and for the preservation of one's name. Early \"bushidō\" literature further enforces the requirement to conduct oneself with calmness, fairness, justice, and propriety. The relationship between learning and the way of the warrior is clearly articulated, one being a natural partner to the other.\n\nOther pundits pontificating on the warrior philosophy covered methods of raising children, appearance, and grooming, but all of this may be seen as part of one's constant preparation for death—to die a good death with one's honor intact, the ultimate aim in a life lived according to \"bushidō\". Indeed, a \"good death\" is its own reward, and by no means assurance of \"future rewards\" in the afterlife. Some \"samurai\", though certainly not all (e.g., Amakusa Shirō), have throughout history held such aims or beliefs in disdain, or expressed the awareness that their station—as it involves killing—precludes such reward, especially in Buddhism. Japanese beliefs surrounding the \"samurai\" and the afterlife are complex and often contradictory, while the soul of a noble warrior suffering in hell or as a lingering spirit occasionally appears in Japanese art and literature, so does the idea of a warrior being reborn upon a lotus throne in paradise\n\nThe \"bushidō\" code is typified by eight virtues:\nBe acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.\nHiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.\nThrough intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.\nTrue warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.\nWhen warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.\nWarriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of who they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.\nWarriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.\n\n\nModern Western translation of documents related to \"bushidō\" began in the 1970s with Carl Steenstrup, who performed research into the ethical codes of famous \"samurai\" including Hōjō Sōun and Imagawa Sadayo.\n\nPrimary research into \"bushidō\" was later conducted by William Scott Wilson in his 1982 text \"Ideals of the Samurai: Writings of Japanese Warriors\". The writings span hundreds of years, family lineage, geography, social class and writing style—yet share a common set of values. Wilson's work also examined older Japanese writings unrelated to the warrior class: the Kojiki, Shoku Nihongi, the Kokin Wakashū and the Konjaku Monogatari, as well as the Chinese Classics (the Analects, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Mencius).\n\nIn May 2008, Thomas Cleary translated a collection of 22 writings on \"bushidō\" by warriors, scholars, political advisers, and educators, spanning 500 years from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Titled \"Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook,\" it gave an insider's view of the samurai world: \"the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism had in influencing samurai ideals\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Greeks appear to have had several kinds of ard from the records. Hesiod advised the farmer to always have two ards handy, so that if one broke the other could replace it. These ards should be of two kinds. The first was the body- or crook-ard, called \"autoguos\" (αυτογυος, \"self-limbed\"), in which the stilt (Gk \"echetle\"; Lat \"stiva\") was of the same piece of timber as the ard-head (Gk \"elyma\"; Lat \"dentale\") and the draft-beam (Gk \"histoboeus\"; Lat \"buris\"). The second was the sole-ard, called \"pekton\" (πηκτον, \"fixed\"), because in it three parts (stilt + sole (Gk \"gyes\") + beam), which were of three kinds of timber, were adjusted to one another and fastened together by nails.\n\nThe \"autoguos\" crook-ard was made from a sapling with two branches growing from its trunk in opposite directions. In ploughing, the trunk served as the draft-beam, one of the two branches stood upwards and became the stilt, and the other scratched the ground and, sometimes shod with bronze or iron, acted as the share (Gk \"hynis\"; L \"vomer\").\n\nBased on an article from \"A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,\" John Murray, London, 1875.\nἄρατρον\n\n"}
{"id": "66981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66981", "title": "Epidemic", "text": "Epidemic\n\nAn epidemic (from Greek ἐπί \"epi\" \"upon or above\" and δῆμος \"demos\" \"people\") is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time, usually two weeks or less. For example, in meningococcal infections, an attack rate in excess of 15 cases per 100,000 people for two consecutive weeks is considered an epidemic.\n\nEpidemics of infectious disease are generally caused by several factors including a change in the ecology of the host population (e.g. increased stress or increase in the density of a vector species), a genetic change in the pathogen reservoir or the introduction of an emerging pathogen to a host population (by movement of pathogen or host). Generally, an epidemic occurs when host immunity to either an established pathogen or newly emerging novel pathogen is suddenly reduced below that found in the endemic equilibrium and the transmission threshold is exceeded.\n\nAn epidemic may be restricted to one location; however, if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a pandemic. The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a baseline rate of incidence; epidemics for certain diseases, such as influenza, are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline. A few cases of a very rare disease may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the common cold) would not.\n\nThere are several changes that may occur in an infectious agent that may trigger an epidemic. These include:\n\nAn epidemic disease is not required to be contagious, and the term has been applied to West Nile fever and the obesity epidemic (e.g. by the World Health Organisation), among others.\n\nThe conditions which govern the outbreak of epidemics include infected food supplies such as contaminated drinking water and the migration of populations of certain animals, such as rats or mosquitoes, which can act as disease vectors. Certain epidemics occur at certain seasons.\n\nFor example, whooping-cough occurs in spring, whereas measles produces two epidemics, one in winter and one in March. Influenza, the common cold, and other infections of the upper respiratory tract, such as sore throat, occur predominantly in the winter.\nThere is another variation, both as regards the number of people affected and the number who die in successive epidemics: the severity of successive epidemics rises and falls over periods of five or ten years.\n\nIn a common source outbreak epidemic, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.\n\nIn a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.\n\nMany epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks (sometimes referred as mixed outbreak).\n\nFor example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or an environmental vectors may spread a zoonotic diseases agent.\n\nExperts suggest that the best way to prepare for an epidemic is to have a disease surveillance system, be able to quickly dispatch emergency workers, especially local-based emergency workers, and have a legitimate way to guarantee the safety and health of health workers.\n\nEffective preparations for a response to a pandemic are multi-layered. The first layer is a disease surveillance system. Tanzania, for example, runs a national lab that runs testing for 200 health sites and tracks the spread of infectious diseases. The next layer is the actual response to an emergency. According to U.S.-based columnist Michael Gerson, only the U.S. military and NATO have the global capability to respond to such an emergency.\n\nGates proposed that the world responded slowly to the Ebola virus outbreak because of a lack of preparation. Two weeks after the 2013 typhoon hit the Philippines, over 150 foreign medical teams were on the ground helping with injured victims. After the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, a team of aid workers who had been helping Afghan refugees for several decades were able to get to the victims in less than 24 hours. Dr. Bruce Aylward, assistant director general for emergencies at the World Health Organization, says that in the case of the Ebola outbreak, \"there was no way anyone could guarantee the right of medical evacuation for people affected by Ebola.” \n\nThe CDC will scale back global disease prevention efforts by 80 percent by October 2019 due to a lack of funding (as funding had been temporarily increased in 2014 to address the Ebola epidemic).\n\nThe term epidemic derives from a word form attributed to Homer's \"Odyssey\", which later took its medical meaning from the \",\" a treatise by Hippocrates. Before Hippocrates, \"epidemios\", \"epidemeo\", \"epidamos\", and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of \"indigenous\" or \"endemic.\" Thucydides' description of the Plague of Athens is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic. By the early 17th century, the terms endemic and epidemic referred to contrasting conditions of population-level disease, with the endemic condition at low rates of occurrence and the epidemic condition widespread.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "67062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67062", "title": "Pastry", "text": "Pastry\n\nPastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter) that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as \"bakers' confectionery\". The word \"pastries\" suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches and pasties.\n\nThe French word pâtisserie is also used in English (with or without the accent) for the same foods. Originally, the French word \"pastisserie\" referred to anything, such as a meat pie, made in dough (\"paste\", later \"pâte\") and not typically a luxurious or sweet product.. This meaning still persisted in the nineteenth century, though by then the term more often referred to the sweet and often ornate confections implied today.\n\nPastry can also refer to the pastry dough, from which such baked products are made. Pastry dough is rolled out thinly and used as a base for baked products.\n\nPastry is differentiated from bread by having a higher fat content, which contributes to a flaky or crumbly texture. A good pastry is light and airy and fatty, but firm enough to support the weight of the filling. When making a shortcrust pastry, care must be taken to blend the fat and flour thoroughly before adding any liquid. This ensures that the flour granules are adequately coated with fat and less likely to develop gluten. On the other hand, overmixing results in long gluten strands that toughen the pastry. In other types of pastry such as Danish pastry and croissants, the characteristic flaky texture is achieved by repeatedly rolling out a dough similar to that for yeast bread, spreading it with butter, and folding it to produce many thin layers.\n\n\n\nDifferent kinds of pastries are made by utilizing the natural characteristics of wheat flour and certain fats. When wheat flour is mixed with water and kneaded into plain dough, it develops strands of gluten, which are what make bread tough and elastic. In a typical pastry, however, this toughness is unwanted, so fat or oil is added to slow down the development of gluten. Pastry flour can also be used, since it typically has a lower level of protein than all-purpose or bread flours.\n\nLard or suet work well because they have a coarse, crystalline structure that is very effective. Using unclarified butter does not work well because of its water content; clarified butter, which is virtually water-free, is better, but shortcrust pastry using only butter may develop an inferior texture. If the fat is melted with hot water or if liquid oil is used, the thin oily layer between the grains offers less of an obstacle to gluten formation and the resulting pastry is tougher.\n\nThe European tradition of pastry-making is often traced back to the shortcrust era of flaky doughs that were in use throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times. In the ancient Mediterranean, the Romans, Greeks and Phoenicians all had filo-style pastries in their culinary traditions. There is also strong evidence that Egyptians produced pastry-like confections which were made by dipping a baked flour cake in honey and serving with desert nuts as toppings. They had professional bakers that surely had the skills to do so, and they also had needed materials like flour, oil, and honey.\nIn the plays of Aristophanes, written in the 5th century BC, there is mention of sweetmeats, including small pastries filled with fruit. Roman cuisine used flour, oil and water to make pastries that were used to cover meats and fowls during baking in order to keep in the juices, but the pastry was not meant to be eaten. A pastry that was meant to be eaten was a richer pastry that was made into small pastries containing eggs or little birds and that were often served at banquets. Greeks and Romans both struggled in making a good pastry because they used oil in the cooking process, and oil causes the pastry to lose its stiffness.\n\nIn the medieval cuisine of Northern Europe, pastry chefs were able to produce nice, stiff pastries because they cooked with shortening and butter. Some incomplete lists of ingredients have been found in medieval cookbooks, but no full, detailed versions. There were stiff, empty pastries called coffins or 'huff paste', that were eaten by servants only and included an egg yolk glaze to help make them more enjoyable to consume. Medieval pastries also included small tarts to add richness.\n\nIt was not until about the mid-16th century that actual pastry recipes began appearing. These recipes were adopted and adapted over time in various European countries, resulting in the myriad pastry traditions known to the region, from Portuguese \"pastéis de nata\" in the west to Russian \"pirozhki\" in the east. The use of chocolate in pastry-making in the west, so commonplace today, arose only after Spanish and Portuguese traders brought chocolate to Europe from the New World starting in the 16th century. Many culinary historians consider French pastry chef Antonin Carême (1784–1833) to have been the first great master of pastry making in modern times.\n\nPastry-making has a strong tradition in many parts of Asia. Chinese pastry is made from rice, or different types of flour, with fruit, sweet bean paste or sesame-based fillings. The mooncakes are part of Chinese Mid Autumn Festival traditions, while cha siu bao, steamed or baked pork buns, are a regular savory dim sum menu item. In the 19th century, the British brought western-style pastry to the far east, though it would be the French-influenced Maxim in the 1950s that made western pastry popular in Chinese-speaking regions starting with Hong Kong. The term \"western cake\" (西餅) is used to refer to western pastry, otherwise Chinese pastry is assumed. Other Asian countries such as Korea prepare traditional pastry-confections such as tteok, hangwa, and yaksik with flour, rice, fruits, and regional specific ingredients to make unique desserts. Japan also has specialized pastry-confections better known as mochi and manjū. Pastry-confections that originate in Asia are clearly distinct from those that originate in the west, which are generally much sweeter.\n\nPastry chefs use a combination of culinary ability and creativity for baking, decoration, and flavoring with ingredients. Many baked goods require a lot of time and focus. Presentation is an important aspect of pastry and dessert preparation. The job is often physically demanding, requiring attention to detail and long hours. Pastry chefs are also responsible for creating new recipes to put on the menu, and they work in restaurants, bistros, large hotels, casinos and bakeries. Pastry baking is usually done in an area slightly separate from the main kitchen. This section of the kitchen is in charge of making pastries, desserts, and other baked goods.\n\n"}

Anzac biscuits have long been associated with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) established in World War I.\n\nThe biscuits were sent by wives and women's groups to soldiers abroad because the ingredients do not spoil easily and the biscuits kept well during naval transportation. Today, Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale.\n\nAnzac biscuits should not be confused with hardtack, which was nicknamed \"ANZAC wafers\" in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDuring a speech to the East Otago Federation of Women's Institutes, Professor Helen Leach, of the Archaeology Department of the University of Otago in New Zealand, stated that the first published use of the name Anzac in a recipe was in an advertisement in the 7th edition of \"St Andrew's Cookery Book\" (Dunedin, 1915). This was a cake, not a biscuit, and there were no mixing instructions. A recipe for \"Anzac Biscuits\" appeared in the \"War Chest Cookery Book\" (Sydney, 1917) but was for a different biscuit altogether. The same publication included a prototype of today's Anzac biscuit, called Rolled Oats Biscuits. The combination of the name Anzac and the recipe now associated with it first appeared in the 9th edition of \"St Andrew's Cookery Book\" (Dunedin, 1921) under the name \"Anzac Crispies\". Subsequent editions renamed this \"Anzac Biscuits\" and Australian cookery books followed suit. Professor Leach also said that further research might reveal earlier references to the name and recipe in Australia or New Zealand.\n\nRather than being sent to the front lines for the soldiers to eat as some people think, ANZAC biscuits were commonly eaten at galas, fetes and other public events such as parades, where they were sold to raise money to support the war effort. At the time they were often called \"soldier's biscuits\", and the fundraising that was organised by the Patriotic Funds accumulated 6.5 million pounds to support New Zealand troops in the war.\n\nToday, Anzac biscuits are manufactured commercially for retail sale. Because of their historical military connection with the ANZACs and ANZAC Day, these biscuits are still used as a fundraising item for the Royal New Zealand Returned Services' Association (RSA) and the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL). Special collectors old-style biscuit tins with World War military artwork are usually produced in the lead up to Anzac Day and sold in supermarkets, in addition to the standard plastic packets available all year. The official RSL biscuit is produced by \"Unibic\" under license.\n\nA British (though still Australian-produced) version of the Anzac biscuit, supporting the Royal British Legion, is available in several major supermarket chains in the UK.\n\nThe term Anzac is protected under Australian law and cannot be used in Australia without permission from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs; misuse can be legally enforced particularly for commercial purposes. Likewise similar restrictions on naming are enshrined in New Zealand law where the Governor General can elect to enforce naming legislation. There is a general exemption granted for Anzac biscuits, as long as these biscuits remain basically true to the original recipe and are both referred to and sold as Anzac biscuits and never as cookies.\n\nThis restriction resulted in the Subway chain of restaurants dropping the biscuit from their menu in September 2008. After being ordered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to bake the biscuits according to the original recipe, Subway decided not to continue to offer the biscuit, as they found that their supplier was unable to develop a cost-effective means of duplicating the recipe.\n\nNotably, Anzac biscuit recipes omit eggs because of the scarcity of eggs during the war (after most poultry farmers joined the war effort) and so that the biscuits would not spoil when shipped long distances.\n"}

It is a meringue dessert with a crisp crust and soft, light inside, usually topped with fruit and whipped cream. The name is pronounced , or like the name of the dancer, which was .\n\nThe dessert is believed to have been created in honour of the dancer either during or after one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. The nationality of its creator has been a source of argument between the two nations for many years. In 2008, food anthropologist Professor Helen Leach published \"The Pavlova Story: A Slice of New Zealand's Culinary History\", in which she posited that the earliest known recipe was published in New Zealand. Later research by Andrew Wood and Annabelle Utrecht suggested the dessert originated in the United States and was based on an earlier Austrian dish, Spanische Windtorte.\n\nThe dessert is a popular dish and an important part of the national cuisine of both Australia and New Zealand, and with its simple recipe, is frequently served during celebratory and holiday meals. It is a dessert most identified with the summer time and popularly eaten during that period including at Christmas time; however, it is also eaten all year round in many Australian and New Zealand homes.\n\nKeith Money, a biographer of Anna Pavlova, wrote that a hotel chef in Wellington, New Zealand, created the dish when Pavlova visited there in 1926 on her world tour.\n\nHelen Leach, in her role as a culinary anthropologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, has compiled a library of cookbooks containing 667 pavlova recipes from more than 300 sources. Her book, \"The Pavlova Story: A Slice of New Zealand's Culinary History\", states that the first Australian pavlova recipe was created in 1935 while an earlier version was penned in 1929 in a rural magazine.\n\nThe Australian website \"Australian Flavour\" gives the earlier date of 1926 for its creation, suggesting that \"Home Cookery for New Zealand\", by Australian writer Emily Futter, contained a recipe for \"Meringue with Fruit Filling\". This recipe was similar to today's version of the dessert.\nIt has been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the Esplanade Hotel in Perth, Western Australia in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor of the dish, a relative of Sachse's wrote to Leach suggesting that Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach replied they would not find evidence for that \"because it's just not showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia.\" However a recipe for \"pavlova cake\" was published in \"The Advocate\" in 1935, and a 1937 issue of \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" contains a \"pavlova sweet cake\" recipe. A 1935 advertisement for a chromium ring used to prevent the dessert collapsing also indicates that the term \"pavlova cake\" had some currency in Auckland at that time. Of such arguments, Matthew Evans, a restaurant critic for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", said that it was unlikely that a definitive answer about the pavlova's origins would ever be found. \"People have been doing meringue with cream for a long time, I don't think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think of doing that.\"\n\nThe first known recorded recipe named \"pavlova\" was published in the fifth Australian edition of \"Davis Dainty Dishes\" in 1926. However this \"pavlova\" recipe was not meringue based, but was instead a multi-coloured gelatine dish.\n\nAn article in Melbourne's \"The Argus\" from 17 November 1928 claims an \"American ice-cream\" was named after Pavlova: \"Dame Nellie Melba, of course, has found fame apart from her art in the famous sweet composed of peaches and cream, while Mme. Anna Pavlova lends her name to a popular variety of American ice-cream.\"\n\nResearch conducted by Dr Andrew Paul Wood, a New Zealander, and Australian Annabelle Utrecht found that the origins of the modern pavlova can be traced back to Germany, where it began life as a German torte. It was later brought to America where it evolved into its final form.\n\nFrom similar historical records as Helen Leach, Michael Symons, an Australian then researching in New Zealand, has declared that the pavlova has no singular birthplace. Rather, published recipes reveal the complex process of “social invention” with practical experience circulating, under a variety of names, across both countries. For example, Australians beat New Zealanders to create an accepted pavlova recipe as the “Meringue Cake”. The illusion of some singular invention can be explained by distinguishing a second, associated level of “social construction”, in which cooks, eaters and writers attach a name and myths to produce a widely-held concept that appears so deceptively distinct that it must have had a definite moment of creation.\n\nPavlova is made by beating egg whites (and sometimes salt) to a very stiff consistency, gradually adding caster sugar before folding in vinegar or another acid (e.g. cream of tartar or lemon juice), cornflour, and sometimes vanilla essence, and slow-baking the mixture, similar to meringue.\nPavlova has a crisp and crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in contrast to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour is responsible for the marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.\n\nPavlova is traditionally decorated with a topping of whipped cream and fresh soft fruit such as kiwifruit, passionfruit, and strawberries. Factory-made pavlovas can be purchased at supermarkets and decorated as desired. A commercial product is available that includes pre-mixed ingredients for baking the meringue shell, requiring only the addition of water and sugar.\n\nLeftover decorated pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but the dessert will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova can be left overnight in the oven, or for several days in an airtight container, to be decorated when ready.\n\n“The pav” (short for ‘pavlova’ used in New Zealand and Australia) is popular on Christmas Day as a dessert usually served after being refrigerated due to Christmas being celebrated during the summer in the southern hemisphere.\n\nTe Papa, New Zealand's national museum in Wellington, celebrated its first birthday in February 1999 with the creation of the world's largest pavlova, named \"Pavzilla\", which was cut by the then-Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley. This record was broken by students at the Eastern Institute of Technology in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, in March 2005. Their creation 'Pavkong' stretched 64 metres long in comparison to Te Papa's 45-metre-long pavlova.\nIn August 2010, chef Aaron Campbell displayed a 50-square-metre rugby-themed pavlova, with the Bledisloe Cup in the centre, in the ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, to raise money for the official charity of the All Blacks.\n\nIn 2007, insurance company NZI ran a humorous series of television advertisements in New Zealand highlighting what are locally considered to be historic New Zealand icons being adopted elsewhere, including the pavlova playing on its status as a common feature of the friendly Trans-Tasman rivalry. NZI's parent company is Australian-owned.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "67083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67083", "title": "Lamington", "text": "Lamington\n\nA lamington is an Australian cake, made from squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut. The thin mixture is absorbed into the outside of the sponge cake and left to set, giving the cake a distinctive texture. A common variation has a layer of cream or strawberry jam between two lamington halves.\n\nMaurice French, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Southern Queensland, who has examined the question in depth, believes that it is certain that lamingtons were named after either Lord Lamington, who served as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901, or his wife, Lady Lamington. Most sources incline to the former option. The earliest known reference to the naming of the lamington, from June 1927, links the cake to Lord Lamington.\n\nThe identity of the recipe's inventor has also been debated. Most stories attribute its creation to Lord Lamington's chef, the French-born Armand Galland, who was called upon at short notice to feed unexpected guests. Using only the limited ingredients available, Galland cut up some left-over French vanilla sponge cake baked the day before, dipped the slices in chocolate and set them in coconut. Impressed by Galland's creation, Lamington's guests were said to have later asked for the recipe. This version of events is supported by Lady Lamington's memoirs. Coconut was not widely used in European cooking at that time, but was known to Galland whose wife was from Tahiti where coconut was a common ingredient. Another possible inventor is Amy Schauer, cooking instructor at Brisbane's Central Technical College from 1897 to 1938.\nOne account suggests that the lamington was first served in Toowoomba, when Lord Lamington took his entourage to Harlaxton House to escape the steamy heat of Brisbane, whereas another claims that it was created by Galland at Queensland's Government House in Brisbane during the busy period leading up to Federation in 1901. A further alternative claim is that Lord Lamington's cook, presumably Galland, accidentally dropped a block of sponge cake into a dish of chocolate. It was later discovered that desiccated coconut, sprinkled over the top, made the cakes more appealing.\n\nThe first known mention of \"Lamington cake\" appears in an 1896 newspaper account of a \"Lamington Function\" at Laidley in Queensland. The event was in honour of Lord Lamington (although it appears he did not attend) and also featured \"Lamington Tea\", \"Lamington Soup\" etc, so, in the absence of any description of the cake, the name of the cake might signify nothing more than the name of the event. A 1900 recipe for Lamington Cakes has been found in the \"Queensland Country Life\" newspaper. While the recipe originated in Queensland, it spread quickly, appearing in a Sydney newspaper in 1901 and a New Zealand newspaper in 1902. However, none of these recipes indicate the creator of the recipe nor the reason for its name.\n\nDue to an April Fools' Day prank in a New Zealand newspaper on 1 April 2014 written by Olaf Priol (an anagram of April Fool), some people believe that the lamington was a New Zealand sweet known as a Wellington which existed before the Australian lamington.\n\nLamingtons remain a popular snack across Australia and New Zealand and Friday, 21 July 2006, was designated as National Lamington Day in Australia. Lamingtons are often sold at fundraisers for schools or charity groups, known as \"lamington drives\". Some Australians shorten the name to \"Lammo\" (singular) or \"Lammos\" (plural).\n\nA similar but smaller-sized confection is known in South Africa as (porcupines), while in the U.S. city of Cleveland, they are called coconut bars. Another similar dessert known as čupavci or coconut cubes is also eaten in Slovenia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary and Romania.\n\nIn New Zealand, a raspberry icing variant is popular.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the lamington was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \"innovation and invention\".\n\n"}
{"id": "67157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67157", "title": "Tzatziki", "text": "Tzatziki\n\nTzatziki, cacık or tarator is a dip, soup, or sauce found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East. It is made of salted strained yogurt or diluted yogurt mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, sometimes with vinegar or lemon juice, and herbs such as dill, mint, parsley and thyme. It is generally served as a cold appetizer (meze) or a side dish.\n\nThe Greek word \"tzatziki\" () comes from the Turkish word . According to Olga Razuvajeva, the word comes from the Armenian \"cacıg\" (). \n\nThe root \"cac\" is likely related to several words in Western Asian languages. Persian \"\" () refers to various herbs used for cooking. Evliya Çelebi's 17th-century \"Seyâhatnâme\" travelogue defined \"cacıχ\" (\"cacıg\") as a kind of herb that is added to food. Ahmet Vefik Pasha's 1876 Ottoman dictionary defined \"cacık\" as an herb salad with yogurt. This remains the most common definition today.\n\nThe form \"tarator\" is found in languages from the Balkans to the Levant, and appears to be of Slavic origin, coming from Bulgaria.\n\nGreek-style \"tzatziki\" sauce is typically served as a side with meat dishes; for example, it can be served with spiced chicken and vegetable couscous. It may also be served as part of an assorted meze small plate platter that is traditionally served with the anise-flavored liquor called ouzo.\n\nTzatziki is made of strained yogurt (usually from sheep or goat milk) mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil, and sometimes lemon juice, and dill or mint or parsley. Some variations are made with cattails or purslane, tofu, dill, and seasoned with Vege-sal and either whole allspice or spicebush berries.\n\nPurslane is called \"glistrida\" in Greek and this may be called \"glistrida me yiaourti\" meaning \"purslane and yogurt salad\" rather than \"tzatziki\". One simple recipe calls for purslane, olive oil, red wine vinegar and dill. Another is made with purslane, mint, cilantro, parsley and ground coriander, along with the standard yogurt-cucumber base.\n\nTurkish \"cacık\" is made by combining a bit of water and yogurt in a deep bowl together with garlic and different combinations of fresh vegetables and herbs. The amount of water used depends on how thick the cook wants the cacık to be—sometimes the dish is served as a cold soup, but it can also be made thicker according to taste. Labneh may be substituted for some of the yogurt. Garlic is crushed in a mortar and pestle together with salt and the cucumbers are either chopped or grated. The crushed garlic, yogurt and cucumber are combined thoroughly before the dish is garnished with some combination of aleppo pepper, paprika, sumac or mint. It is especially popular during summer months and may optionally be served with ice.\n\nWhen shredded carrots are added along with the cucumber it is called \"havuçlu cacık\". In Turkey \"tarator\" is also called \"balkan cacığı\" and is made with fresh scallions and mint. Other \"cacık\" varieties may include shredded radish or chopped red pepper and fresh parsley. Dill can optionally be added as well. Some recipes add fresh basil or a tablespoon of vinegar. One version with basil is made with made with ground walnuts, hazelnuts and chopped fresh basil.\n\nNot all \"cacıks\" are made with shredded cucumber—sometimes various types of leafy greens or herbs are used in combination with other ingredients. For example, one version calls for boiled wheat berry (the same kind used to make Noah's Pudding) and fresh dill. It can also be made into a type of salad with purslane. Sometimes it is made with unripe (green) almonds called \"çağla\" in Turkish. It may be also made from wild edible plants like \"çıtlık\" and eaten in a wrap called \"dürüm\".\n\nFor \"cacıklı arap köftesi\", kofta made from a mix of bulgur and ground meat is served over \"cacık\". In this case the \"cacık\" is made with chard rather than the usual cucumber. (Spinach or parsley may be substituted for the chard. Some recipes use purslane.) \"Bulgurlu madımak cacığı\" is made with cracked wheat, cucumber and a type of knotweed called \"madımak\".\n\nThere are dishes similar to tzatziki called tarator in many Balkan countries. Tarator is more often prepared as a cold soup, popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add bread. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with lettuce or carrots.\n\nThe thicker variation more similar to Tzatziki is sometimes known as \"dry tarator\" , or as \"Snezhanka\" salad (салата \"Снежанка\"), which means \"Snow white salad\", and is served as an appetizer or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water. The cucumbers, garlic, minced walnuts, salt and vegetable oil are then added. \n\nIn Bulgaria, Tarator is a popular meze (appetizer), but also served as a side dish along with Shopska salad with most meals. Sunflower oil and Olive oil more commonly used, and walnut is sometimes omitted. Tarator is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It's a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\n\nIn Albania, Tarator is a very popular dish in summer time. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yoghurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squids are often offered with Tarator.\n\nIn Cyprus, the dish is known as \"ταλαττούρι\" (talattouri) and is not a soup like Bulgarian tarator but more of a dipping sauce. \n\nIt is made from strained yogurt, sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves and sprinkled with oregano and sometimes olive oil.\n\nSimilar dishes in Iraq are known as \"jajeek\". They are normally served as meze to accompany alcoholic drinks, especially Arak, an Ouzo-like drink made from dates.\n\nA similar dish in Iran is called ash-e doogh, and instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as basil, leek, mint, black pepper and raisins. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.\n\nA variation in the Caucasus mountains, called ovdukh, uses kefir instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and ham to create a variation of okroshka, sometimes referred to as a 'Caucasus okroshka'. Mizeria is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.\n\nIn South Asia a similar dish is made with yoghurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called raita.\n"}
{"id": "67396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67396", "title": "Synonym", "text": "Synonym\n\nA synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another lexeme (word or phrase) in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. For example, the words \"begin\", \"start\", \"commence\", and \"initiate\" are all synonyms of one another. Words are typically synonymous in one particular sense: for example, \"long\" and \"extended\" in the context \"long time\" or \"extended time\" are synonymous, but \"long\" cannot be used in the phrase \"extended family\". Synonyms with the exact same meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. The former are sometimes called cognitive synonyms and the latter, near-synonyms, plesionyms or poecilonyms.\n\nSome lexicographers claim that no synonyms have exactly the same meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because etymology, orthography, phonic qualities, connotations, ambiguous meanings, usage, and so on make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: \"feline\" is more formal than \"cat\"; \"long\" and \"extended\" are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a \"long arm\" is not the same as an \"extended arm\"). Synonyms are also a source of euphemisms.\n\nMetonymy can sometimes be a form of synonymy: \"the White House\" is used as a synonym of \"the administration\" in referring to the U.S. executive branch under a specific president. Thus a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word \"metonym\" is a hyponym of the word \"synonym\".\n\nThe analysis of synonymy, polysemy, hyponymy, and hypernymy is inherent to taxonomy and ontology in the information-science senses of those terms. It has applications in pedagogy and machine learning, because they rely on word-sense disambiguation.\n\nThe word comes from Ancient Greek \"sýn\" (; \"with\") and \"ónoma\" (; \"name\").\n\nSynonyms can be any part of speech, as long as both words belong to the same part of speech. Examples:\n\n\nSynonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: \"pupil\" as the \"aperture in the iris of the eye\" is not synonymous with \"student\". Such like, \"he expired\" means the same as \"he died\", yet \"my passport has expired\" cannot be replaced by \"my passport has died\".\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the Middle Ages, after the Norman conquest of England. While England's new ruling class spoke Norman French, the lower classes continued to speak Old English (Anglo-Saxon). Thus, today we have synonyms like the Norman-derived \"people\", \"liberty\" and \"archer\", and the Saxon-derived \"folk\", \"freedom\" and \"bowman\".

{"id": "67742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67742", "title": "Percussion cap", "text": "Percussion cap\n\nThe percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, is a type of single-use ignition device used on muzzleloader firearms that enabled them to fire reliably in any weather conditions. This crucial invention gave rise to the caplock or percussion lock system.\n\nBefore this development, firearms used flintlock ignition systems that produced flint-on-steel sparks to ignite a pan of priming powder and thereby fire the gun's main powder charge (the flintlock mechanism replaced older ignition systems such as the matchlock and wheellock). Flintlocks were prone to misfire in wet weather, and many flintlock firearms were later converted to the more reliable percussion system.\n\nThe percussion cap is a small cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as fulminate of mercury. The percussion cap is placed over a hollow metal \"nipple\" at the rear end of the gun barrel. Pulling the trigger releases a hammer that strikes the percussion cap and ignites the explosive primer. The flame travels through the hollow nipple to ignite the main powder charge. Percussion caps were, and still are, made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.\n\nWhile the metal percussion cap was the most popular and widely used type of primer, their small size made them difficult to handle under the stress of combat or while riding a horse. Accordingly, several manufacturers developed alternative, \"auto-priming\" systems. The \"Maynard tape primer\", for example, used a roll of paper \"caps\" much like today's toy cap gun. The Maynard tape primer was fitted to some firearms used in the mid-nineteenth century and a few saw brief use in the American Civil War. Other disc or pellet-type primers held a supply of tiny fulminate detonator discs in a small magazine. Cocking the hammer automatically advanced a disc into position. However, these automatic feed systems were difficult to make with the manufacturing systems in the early and mid-nineteenth century and generated more problems than they solved. They were quickly shelved in favor of a single percussion cap that, while awkward to handle in some conditions, could be carried in sufficient quantities to make up for occasionally dropping one while a jammed tape primer system reduced the rifle to an awkward club.\n\nThe first practical solution for the problem of handling percussion caps in battle was the Prussian 1841 (Dreyse needle gun), which used a long needle to penetrate a paper cartridge filled with black powder and strike the percussion cap that was fastened to the base of the bullet. While it had a number of problems, it was widely used by the Prussians and other German states in the mid-nineteenth century and was a major factor in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War.\n\nIn the 1850s, the percussion cap was first integrated into a metallic cartridge, which contained the bullet, powder charge and primer. By the late 1860s, breech-loading metallic cartridges had made the percussion cap system obsolete. Today, reproduction percussion firearms are popular for recreational shooters and percussion caps are still available (though some modern muzzleloaders use shotshell primers instead of caps). Most percussion caps now use non-corrosive compounds such as lead styphnate.\n\nThe percussion cap replaced the flint, the steel \"frizzen\", and the powder pan of the flint-lock mechanism. It was only generally applied to the British military musket (the Brown Bess) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The first percussion firearm produced for the US military was the percussion carbine version (c.1833) of the M1819 Hall rifle.\n\nThe discovery of fulminates was made by Edward Charles Howard (1774–1816) in 1800. The invention that made the percussion cap possible using the recently discovered fulminates was patented by the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth of Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland in 1807.\n\nThis early system coined \"Percussion Lock\" operated in a near identical fashion to flintlock firearms and used fulminating primer made of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, sulphur and charcoal, ignited by concussion. It was an invention born of necessity; Rev. Forsyth had noticed that sitting birds would startle when smoke puffed from the powder pan of his flintlock shotgun, giving them sufficient warning to escape the shot. His invention of a fulminate-primed firing mechanism deprived the birds of their early warning, by avoiding the initial puff of smoke from the flintlock powder pan and shortening the interval between the trigger pull and the shot leaving the muzzle.\n\nFulminate-primed guns were also less likely to misfire than flintlocks; it was not until after Forsyth's patents expired that the conventional percussion cap system was developed. The percussion cap helped lead to the self-contained cartridge, where the bullet is held in by the casing, the casing is filled with gunpowder and a primer is at the end.\n\nJoshua Shaw, an English-born American, is sometimes credited with the development of the first metallic percussion cap in 1814 but his claim remains clouded with controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822. According to Lewis Winant, the US government's decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention was a mistake. Congress believed Shaw's patent was the earliest and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief but a claim for the percussion cap was filed in 1819 and granted in 1820 as an addition to an 1818 patent by Francois Prelat, two years before Shaw's patent. Prelat may not be the inventor as he made a habit of copying English patents and inventions and the mode of operation he describes is flawed. According to historian Sidney James Gooding, the most likely inventor of the percussion cap is Joseph Egg, around 1817. Shaw's percussion caps used a mixture of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash and ground glass contained in a small metallic cup. Other possible claimants include Joseph Manton and Col. Peter Hawker.\n\nThis invention was gradually improved, and came to be used, first in a steel cap and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later. The alteration of the military flintlock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan and steel \"frizzen\" with a nipple and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint by a smaller hammer formed with a hollow made to fit around the nipple when released by the trigger. On the nipple was placed the copper cap containing the detonating composition, now made of three parts of chlorate of potash, two of fulminate of mercury and one of powdered glass. The hollow in the hammer contained the fragments of the cap if it fragmented, reducing the risk of injury to the firer's eyes. The detonating cap brought about the invention of the modern cartridge case and made possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols. Caps are used in cartridges, grenades, rocket-propelled grenades and rescue flares. Percussion caps are also used in land mine fuzes, boobytrap firing devices and anti-handling devices.\n\nMost purpose-made military booby-trap firing devices contain some form of spring-loaded firing pin designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a detonator at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge—e.g., C4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g., by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked firing pin that flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing it and the attached detonator; the shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.\n\n"}
{"id": "67922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67922", "title": "Ketchup", "text": "Ketchup\n\nKetchup is a sauce used as a condiment. Originally, recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients, but now the unmodified term usually refers to \"tomato ketchup\". Various other terms for the sauce include catsup, \"catchup\" (archaic), ketsup, red sauce, tomato sauce, or, specifically, \"mushroom ketchup\" or \"tomato ketchup\".\n\nKetchup is a sweet and tangy sauce now typically made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with assorted seasonings and spices. The specific spices and flavors vary, but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard; and sometimes include celery, cinnamon or ginger.\n\nThe market leader in the United States (60% market share) and United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz. Hunt's has the second biggest share of the US market with less than 20%. In much of the UK, Australia and New Zealand ketchup is also known as \"tomato sauce\" (a term that means a fresher pasta sauce elsewhere in the world) or \"red sauce\" (especially in Wales).\n\nTomato ketchup is most often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually served hot and may be fried or greasy: french fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, tater tots, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks such as potato chips.\n\nIn the 17th century, the Chinese mixed a concoction of pickled fish and spices and called it (in the Amoy dialect) kôe-chiap or kê-chiap (鮭汁, Mandarin Chinese guī zhī, Cantonese gwai zap) meaning the brine of pickled fish (鮭, salmon; 汁, juice) or shellfish. By the early 18th century, the table sauce had arrived in the Malay states (present day Malaysia and Singapore), where English colonists first tasted it. The Malaysian-Malay word for the sauce was \"kicap or kecap\" (pronounced \"kay-chap\"). That word evolved into the English word \"ketchup\". English settlers took ketchup with them to the American colonies.\n\nThe term \"Catchup\" was used in 1690 in the \"Dictionary of the Canting Crew\" which was well acclaimed in North America. The spelling \"catchup\" may have also been used in the past.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, preparations of ketchup were historically and originally prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient, rather than tomatoes. Ketchup recipes began to appear in British and then American cookbooks in the 18th century. In a 1742 London cookbook, the fish sauce had already taken on a very British flavor, with the addition of shallots and mushrooms. The mushrooms soon became the main ingredient, and from 1750 to 1850 the word ketchup began to mean any number of thin dark sauces made of mushrooms or even walnuts. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770, and was prepared by British colonists in \"English speaking colonies in North America\". In contemporary times, mushroom ketchup is available in the UK, although it is not a commonly used condiment.\n\nMany variations of ketchup were created, but the tomato-based version did not appear until about a century later after other types. An early recipe for \"Tomata Catsup\" from 1817 still has the anchovies that betray its fish-sauce ancestry:\n\nBy the mid-1850s, the anchovies had been dropped.\n\nJames Mease published another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes appeared in \"The Virginia Housewife\" (an influential 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin). American cooks also began to sweeten ketchup in the 19th century.\n\nAs the century progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in popularity in the United States. Ketchup was popular long before fresh tomatoes were. People were less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.\n\nTomato ketchup was sold locally by farmers. Jonas Yerkes is credited as the first American to sell tomato ketchup in a bottle. By 1837, he had produced and distributed the condiment nationally. Shortly thereafter, other companies followed suit. F. & J. Heinz launched their tomato ketchup in 1876. Heinz tomato ketchup was advertised: \"Blessed relief for Mother and the other women in the household!\", a slogan which alluded to the lengthy and onerous process required to produce tomato ketchup in the home. With industrial ketchup production and a need for better preservation there was a great increase of sugar in ketchup, leading to our modern sweet and sour formula. In Australia, it wasn't until the late 19th century that sugar was added to \"tomato sauce\", initially in small quantities, but today contains just as much as American ketchup and only differed in the proportions of tomatoes, salt and vinegar in early recipes.\n\nThe \"Webster's Dictionary\" of 1913 defined \"catchup\" as: \"table sauce made from mushrooms, tomatoes, walnuts, etc. [Also written as ketchup].\"\n\nModern ketchup emerged in the early years of the 20th century, out of a debate over the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in condiments. Harvey W. Wiley, the \"father\" of the Food and Drug Administration in the US, challenged the safety of benzoate which was banned in the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. \nIn response, entrepreneurs including Henry J. Heinz, pursued an alternative recipe that eliminated the need for that preservative. Katherine Bitting, a microbotanist working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, carried out research that proved in 1909 that increasing the sugar and vinegar content of the product would prevent spoilage without use of artificial preservatives. She was assisted by her husband, Arvil Bitting, an official at that agency.\n\nPrior to Heinz (and his fellow innovators), commercial tomato ketchups of that time were watery and thin, in part due to the use of unripe tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.\n\nIn fast food outlets, ketchup is often dispensed in small sachets or tubs. Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup out of the ketchup packets, or peel the foil lid off the tub for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the \"Dip and Squeeze\" packet, which can be opened in either way, giving both options.\n\nSome fast food outlets previously dispensed ketchup from hand-operated pumps into paper cups. This method has made a comeback in the first decade of the 21st century, as cost and environmental concerns over the increasing use of individual plastic ketchup tubs were taken into account.\n\nIn October 2000, Heinz introduced colored ketchup products called EZ Squirt, which eventually included green (2000), purple (2001), mystery (pink, orange, or teal, 2002), and blue (2003). These products were made by adding food coloring to the traditional ketchup. these products were discontinued.\n\nThe term used for the sauce varies. \"Ketchup\" is the dominant term in American English, and Canadian English, although \"catsup\" is commonly used in some southern US states and Mexico.\n\n\"Tomato sauce\" is more common in English-speaking countries outside North America, including Australia and New Zealand. In Canada and the United States, however, \"tomato sauce\" refers to a sauce made from tomato paste, commonly used in pasta sauces, and is \"not\" a synonym for ketchup.\n\n\"Red sauce\" is the term used in Welsh English, Scottish English and some parts of England, such as the Black Country, and in South London, contrasting with brown sauce. In Canadian and American English, \"red sauce\" refers to various tomato-based sauces commonly paired with pasta dishes, and is not a synonym for ketchup.\n\nThe etymology of the word \"ketchup\" is unclear, with multiple competing theories.\n\nOne theory is that the word came to English from the Cantonese \"keh jap\" (茄汁 \"ke2 zap1\", the word literally means \"tomato sauce; tomato juice\" in Cantonese). However, this is likely a folk etymology, as it cannot account for historical terms like \"mushroom ketchup\" and \"walnut ketchup\".\n\nAn alternative theory is that the word derives from one of two words from the Fujian region of coastal southern China: \"kôe-chiap\" (in Xiamen (Amoy)) or \"kê-chiap\" (in Guangzhou (Canton)). Both of these words (鮭汁, kôe-chiap and kêchiap) come from the Amoy dialect of China, where it meant the brine of pickled fish (鮭, salmon; 汁, juice) or shellfish. There are citations of \"koe-chiap\" in the \"Dictionary of the Vernacular or Spoken Language of the Amoy\" (London; Trudner) from 1873, defined as \"brine of pickled fish or shell-fish\".\n\nKetchup may have entered the English language from the Malay word \"kicap\" (pron. \"kichap\", sometimes spelled \"kecap\" or \"ketjap\"). Originally meaning \"fish sauce\", the word itself derives from the Chinese terms above.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, which is similar to Malay, the term \"kecap\" refers to fermented savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: \"kecap asin\" which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and \"kecap manis\" or \"sweet kecap\" in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy. A third type, \"kecap ikan\", meaning \"fish kecap\" is fish sauce similar to the Thai \"nam pla\" or the Philippine \"patis\". It is not, however, soy-based.\n\nAmerican anthropologist E.N. Anderson relies on Elizabeth David to claim that \"ketchup\" is a cognate of the French \"escaveche\", meaning \"food in sauce\", but gives no further authority. The word also exists in Spanish and Portuguese forms as \"escabeche\", \"a sauce for pickling\", which culinary historian Karen Hess traced back to Arabic \"Kabees\", or \"pickling with vinegar\". The term was anglicized to \"caveach\", a word first attested in the late 17th century, at the same time as \"ketchup\".\n\nThe word entered the English language in Britain during the late 17th century, appearing in print as \"catchup\" (1690) and later as \"ketchup\" (1711). The following is a list of early quotations collected by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\n\nHeinz tomato ketchup’s ingredients are: tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes is the first ingredient on the list, which means it has the highest percentage of weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, the sugars of which are made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. The next ingredient is corn syrup, the sugar of which is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.\n\nSome ketchup in the U.S. is labeled \"Fancy\". This is a USDA grade, relating to specific gravity. Fancy ketchup has a higher tomato solid concentration than other USDA grades.\n\nFresh tomatoes received at a tomato processing plant can be turned into a variety of different products, one of which includes ketchup. The process begins by washing the tomatoes to remove any outer dirt and foreign matter from the skin before processing. Upon inspection, damaged, spoiled or unwanted tomatoes will be sorted out manually. Tomatoes will usually be conveyed by water throughout the preliminary stages to avoid bruising.\n\nAfter being sorted, washed and chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats for preservation/precooking and also to destroy any bacteria that could be harmful to the rest of the processing period as well as for the consumer after production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the liquid in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.\n\nKetchup processing includes adding additional ingredients, cooking, more screening and filtering, air-removal, packaging and cooling.\n\nAfter juice filtration, additional ingredients are added to the mixture to achieve the desired taste and consistency. Some of the main ingredients used to create ketchup include sweeteners, vinegar, salt and spices, and flavouring. These additions are usually integrated later on in the process except for some spices added in at the beginning. Throughout the entire process, the temperature must be consistently monitored to make sure all the ingredients are being added and appropriately absorbed. Air is then removed to prevent oxidation, maintain proper colouring and inhibit the growth of any unwanted bacteria. Before being packaged, the ketchup is heated to approx.190 °F (88 °C) to prevent contamination.\n\nAfter packaging, the bottles are immediately sealed to retain the freshness and preserve the shelf-life of the product. The final step is cooling the product via cold air or water to maintain its flavour.\n\nDifferent manufacturers will label their products accordingly with all the necessary nutritional and other legal information as required.\n\nThe following table compares the nutritional value of ketchup with raw ripe tomatoes and salsa, based on information from the USDA Food Nutrient Database.\n\nCommercial tomato ketchup has an additive, usually xanthan gum, which gives the condiment a pseudoplastic or \"shear thinning\" property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can make it difficult to pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom with the heel of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.\n\nKetchup is a non-Newtonian fluid meaning that its viscosity changes under stress and is not constant. It is a shear thinning fluid which means its viscosity decreases with increased shear stress. The equation used to designate a Non-Newtonian fluid is as follows: formula_1. This equation represents apparent viscosity where apparent viscosity is the shear stress divided by shear rate. Viscosity is dependent on stress. This is apparent when you shake a bottle of tomato sauce/ketchup so it becomes liquid enough to squirt out. Its viscosity decreased with stress.\n\nThe molecular composition of ketchup is what creates ketchup's pseudoplastic characteristics. Small polysaccharides, sugars, acids, and water make up the majority of the metastable ketchup product, and these small structures are able to move more easily throughout a matrix because of their low mass. While exposed to shear stress, the molecules within the suspension are able to respond quickly and create an alignment within the product. The bonds between the molecules are mostly hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and electrostatic interactions, all of which can be broken when subject to stress. Hydrogen bonds are constantly rearranging within a product due to their need to be in the lowest energy state, which further confirms that the bonds between the molecules will be easily disrupted. This alignment only lasts for as long as shear stress is applied. The molecules return to their original disorganized state once the shear stress dissipates.\n\nIn 2017, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported the development of a bottle coating that allowed all the product to slip out without leaving a residue.\n\nKetchup is one of the many products that is leachable; meaning that the water within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water on top of the ketchup due to the molecular instability within the product. This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the ketchup suspension.\n\nPectin is a polysaccharide within tomatoes that has the ability to bind to itself and to other molecules, especially water, around it. This enables it to create a gel-like matrix, dependent on the amount within the solution. Water is a large part of ketchup, due to it being 80% of the composition of distilled vinegar. In order for the water within the ketchup to be at the lowest possible energy state, all of the hydrogen bonds that are able to be made within the matrix must be made. The water bound to the polysaccharide moves more slowly within the matrix, which is unfavorable with respect to entropy. The increased order within the polysaccharide-water complex gives rise to a high-energy state, in which the water will want to be relieved. This concept implies that water will more favorably bind with itself because of the increased disorder between water molecules. This is partially the cause for water leaching out of solution when left undisturbed for a short period of time.\n\nOther interactions that induce leaching are electrostatic and ionic interactions. Electrostatic interactions occur between charged molecules, which have repulsive or attractive forces between each other. The pectin within ketchup will have negative and neutral charges along the molecule due to the hydroxyl groups and relative pH, which is 3.9 on average. Pectin is most stable at a pH of 3.5, so the more basic pH within ketchup will protonate the hydroxyl side chains and therefore create a less viscous gel. Acetic acid within vinegar also has hydroxyl groups that will have a dispersed amount of negative and neutral charges along each molecule. The acetic acid and pectin will display repulsive interactions between the negatively charged oxygens on each molecule. The hydroxyls on each molecule will be able to form hydrogen bonds with the water in the product. The addition of salt will reduce the repulsive interactions between the negatively charged side chains of acetic acid and pectin within solution because they will create bonds with the dissociated sodium and chloride ions. The hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions will encourage leaching because the formation of bonds associated with the need for molecules to be in the lowest energy state are not always bonds that happen between different molecules and instead are formed between like molecules, causing aggregation.\n\nA way for ketchup manufacturing companies to avoid leaching of their products would be to add a hydrocolloid. Xanthan gum is able to stabilize ketchup by covalently binding to water. This strong bond keeps water from separating out of the ketchup and creating a layer at the surface.\n\n"}

{"id": "68230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68230", "title": "Mayday", "text": "Mayday\n\nMayday is an emergency procedure word used internationally as a distress signal in voice-procedure radio communications.\n\nIt is used to signal a life-threatening emergency primarily by aviators and mariners, but in some countries local organizations such as firefighters, police forces, and transportation organizations also use the term. The call is always given three times in a row (\"Mayday mayday mayday\") to prevent its being mistaken for some similar-sounding phrase under noisy conditions, and to distinguish an \"actual\" mayday call from a message \"about\" a mayday call.\n\nThe \"mayday\" procedure word was originated in 1923, by a senior radio officer at Croydon Airport in London. The officer, Frederick Stanley Mockford, was asked to think of a word that would indicate distress and would easily be understood by all pilots and ground staff in an emergency. Since much of the traffic at the time was between Croydon and Le Bourget Airport in Paris, he proposed the expression \"mayday\" from the French \"\" ('help me'), a shortened form of \"venez m'aider\" ('come and help me'). It is unrelated to the holiday May Day.\n\nBefore the voice call \"mayday\", SOS was the Morse code equivalent of the mayday call. In 1927, the International Radiotelegraph Convention of Washington adopted the voice call mayday as the radiotelephone distress call in place of the SOS radiotelegraph (Morse code) call.\n\nIf a mayday call cannot be sent because a radio is not available, a variety of other distress signals and calls for help can be used. Additionally, a mayday call can be sent on behalf of one vessel by another; this is known as a mayday relay.\n\nCivilian aircraft making a mayday call in United States airspace are encouraged by the Federal Aviation Administration to use the following format, omitting any portions as necessary for expediency or where they are irrelevant (capitalization as in the original source):\n\nMaking a false distress call is a criminal offence in many countries, punishable by a fine, restitution, and possible imprisonment.\n\n\"Pan-pan\" (from the French: \"\", 'a breakdown') indicates an urgent situation, such as a mechanical failure or a medical problem, of a lower order than a \"grave and imminent threat requiring immediate assistance\". The suffix \"medico\" used to be added by vessels in British waters to indicate a medical problem (\"pan-pan medico\", repeated three times), or by aircraft declaring a non-life-threatening medical emergency of a passenger in flight, or those operating as protected medical transport in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. \"Pan-pan medico\" is no longer in official use.\n\nSometimes the phrase \"declaring emergency\" is used in aviation, as an alternative to calling \"mayday\". For example, Swissair Flight 111 radioed \"Swissair one-eleven heavy is declaring emergency\" after their situation had worsened, upgrading from \"pan-pan\".\n\nHowever, the International Civil Aviation Organization recommends the use of the standard \"pan-pan\" and \"mayday\" calls instead of \"declaring an emergency\". Cases of pilots using phrases other than \"pan-pan\" and \"mayday\" have caused confusion and errors in aircraft handling.\n\n\"Seelonce mayday\" (using an approximation of the French pronunciation of ') or \"seelonce distress\" (in actual French, ') is a demand that the channel only be used by the vessel in distress and the Coast Guard or other responding authority (and any other vessels they ask to assist in handling the emergency). The channel may not be used for normal working traffic until \"seelonce feenee\" or \"prudonce\" (see below) is broadcast. \"Seelonce mayday\" (followed by the name of the disturbing station) may only be sent from the vessel in distress. \"Seelonce distress\" (followed by the name of the disturbing station) may only be sent from a station which is not participating in the emergency traffic. The expressions \"stop transmitting – mayday\" and \"stop transmitting – distress\" are aeronautical equivalents of \"seelonce mayday\" and \"seelonce distress\".\n\n\"Seelonce feenee\" (from French ', 'silence finished') means that the emergency situation has been concluded and the channel may now be used normally. The call \"prudonce\" (from the French pronunciation of ', 'caution') can also be used to allow important working traffic to resume on that channel before resolution of the emergency. \"Distress traffic ended\" is the aeronautical equivalent of \"seelonce feenee\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68284", "title": "Chop suey", "text": "Chop suey\n\nChop suey () is a dish in American Chinese cuisine and other forms of overseas Chinese cuisine, consisting of meat (often chicken, fish, beef, shrimp, or pork) and eggs, cooked quickly with vegetables such as bean sprouts, cabbage, and celery and bound in a starch-thickened sauce. It is typically served with rice but can become the Chinese-American form of chow mein with the addition of stir-fried noodles.\n\nChop suey has become a prominent part of American Chinese cuisine, Filipino cuisine, Canadian Chinese cuisine, German Chinese cuisine, Indian Chinese cuisine, and Polynesian cuisine. In Chinese Indonesian cuisine it is known as \"cap cai\" (雜菜, \"mixed vegetables\") and mainly consists of vegetables.\n\nChop suey is widely believed to have been invented in the U.S. by Chinese Americans, but anthropologist E. N. Anderson, a scholar of Chinese food, traces the dish to \"tsap seui\" (杂碎, \"miscellaneous leftovers\"), common in Taishan (Toisan), a county in Guangdong province, the home of many early Chinese immigrants to the United States. Hong Kong doctor Li Shu-fan likewise reported that he knew it in Toisan in the 1890s.\n\nThe long list of conflicting stories about the origin of chop suey is, in the words of food historian Alan Davidson, \"a prime example of culinary mythology\" and typical of popular foods.\n\nOne account claims that it was invented by Chinese American cooks working on the transcontinental railroad in the 19th century. Another tale is that it was created during Qing Dynasty premier Li Hongzhang's visit to the United States in 1896 by his chef, who tried to create a meal suitable for both Chinese and American palates. Another story is that Li wandered to a local Chinese restaurant after the hotel kitchen had closed, where the chef, embarrassed that he had nothing ready to offer, came up with the new dish using scraps of leftovers. Yet recent research by the scholar Renqui Yu led him to conclude that \"no evidence can be found in available historical records to support the story that Li Hung Chang ate chop suey in the United States.\" Li brought three Chinese chefs with him, and would not have needed to eat in local restaurants or invent new dishes in any case. Yu speculates that shrewd Chinese American restaurant owners took advantage of the publicity surrounding his visit to promote chop suey as Li's favorite.\nAnother myth is that, in the 1860s, a Chinese restaurant cook in San Francisco was forced to serve something to drunken miners after hours, when he had no fresh food. To avoid a beating, the cook threw leftovers in a wok and served the miners who loved it and asked what dish is this—he replied \"chopped sui\". There is no good evidence for any of these stories.\n\nChop suey appears in an 1884 article in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\", by Wong Chin Foo, \"Chinese Cooking\", which he says \"may justly be so-called the 'national dish of China'.\" An 1888 description states it was a \"staple dish for the Chinese gourmand is chow chop svey , a mixture of chickens' livers and gizzards, fungi, bamboo buds, pigs' tripe, and bean sprouts stewed with spices.\" In 1898, it is described as \"A Hash of Pork, with Celery, Onions, Bean Sprouts, etc.\"\n\nDuring his travels in the United States, Liang Qichao, a Guangdong (Canton) native, wrote in 1903 that there existed in the United States a food item called \"chop suey\" which was popularly served by Chinese restaurateurs, but which local Chinese people do not eat, because the cooking technique is \"really awful\".\n\nIn earlier periods of Chinese history, \"chop suey\" or \"chap sui\" in Cantonese, and \"za sui\", in Mandarin, has the different meaning of cooked animal offal or entrails. For example, in the classic novel \"Journey to the West\" (circa 1590), Sun Wukong tells a lion-monster in chapter 75: \"When I passed through Guangzhou, I bought a pot for cooking \"za sui\" – so I'll savour your liver, entrails, and lungs.\" The term \"za sui\" (杂碎) is found in newer Chinese-English dictionaries with both meanings listed: cooked entrails, and \"chop suey\" in the Western sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recipe of a variant using Mexican-style beans and rice was published in an NPR article: \n\n"}
