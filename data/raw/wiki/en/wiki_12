Literally, \"pe'ah\" means \"corner, side, edge\". There are different styles of \"payot\" among Haredi / Hasidic, Yemenite, and Chardal Jews. Yemenite Jews call their sidelocks \"simonim\" (), literally, \"signs\", because their long-curled sidelocks served as a distinguishing feature in the Yemenite society (differentiating them from their non-Jewish neighbors).\n\nThe Torah says, \"You shall not round off the \"pe'at\" () of your head\" (). The word \"pe'at\" was taken to mean the hair in front of the ears extending to beneath the cheekbone, on a level with the nose (Talmud – Makkot 20a). The Mishnah interpreted the regulation as applying only to men. Thus it became the custom in certain circles to allow the hair over the ears to grow, and hang down in curls or ringlets. According to Maimonides, shaving the sidelocks was a heathen practice.\nThere is considerable discussion in the halachic literature as to the precise location of the payot and of the ways in which their removal is prohibited.\n\nAs kabbalistic teachings spread into Slavonic lands, the custom of \"payot\" became accepted there. In 1845, the practice was banned in the Russian Empire. Crimean Karaites did not wear \"payot\", and the Crimean Tatars consequently referred to them as \"zulufsız çufutlar\" (\"Jews without payot\"), to distinguish them from the Krymchaks, referred to as \"zuluflı çufutlar\" (\"Jews with payot\"). Many Hasidic and Yemenite Jews let their sidelocks grow particularly long. Some Haredi men grow sidelocks, but keep them short or tuck them behind the ears. Even among Jewish groups in which the men do not wear noticeable \"payot\", often, the young boys do wear them until around the age of bar mitzvah.\n\nThe lengths and maintenance of the \"payot\" vary noticeably among Jewish groups:\nMost other Hasidic groups wear their payot down and curled.\n\nThe Lithuanian Jews are less influenced by Kabbalistic practises, but still retain sidelocks to a degree, in a small number of variant styles:\n\n"}

A popular variety in the United States is peanut butter and jelly. Sealed crustless sandwiches are mass-produced by The J. M. Smucker Company under the brand name \"Uncrustables\".\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a number of patents for various versions of sealed crustless sandwiches. These include , , and . The '596 patent has been especially controversial since it appears to the general public as if an obvious and well known invention has been patented. On September 25, 2007, the Patent and Trademark Office concluded a reexamination of the '596 patent and issued a certificate cancelling all claims.\n\nThe sandwich has been loosely categorized as a dumpling because of its crimping, usually in a humorous fashion analogous to a Pop-Tart being classified similarly. The manufacturer of \"Uncrustables\", however, unequivocally describes their product as a sandwich.\n\nThe first claim of Menusaver's patent reads:\n\nThat is, the patent described a sandwich with a layer of filling in between two pieces of bread which are crimped shut and have their crust removed. The other nine claims of the patent elaborate the idea further, including the coating of two sides of the bread with peanut butter first before putting the jelly in the middle, so that the jelly would not seep into the bread—the layers of filling \"are engaged to one another to form a reservoir for retaining the second filling in between\".\n\nMany intellectual property experts and members of the general public view this patent as an example of the patent office's inability to properly examine patent applications. The patent examiner cited only seven previous patents issued between 1963 and 1998, and a 1994 book called \"50 Great Sandwiches\" that were deemed relevant to the novelty and nonobviousness of the invention. He concluded that the invention was indeed novel and not obvious and allowed the claims.\n\nSince then, many more earlier patents and publications have been found that teach some or all of the different aspects of the invention. These include a 1949 patent () that describes a device to create these types of sandwiches: \"An object of this invention is to provide... a means for locating said filling in the center of the sandwich and sealing the marginal edges of the pieces by heat and pressure to preclude the escape of filling from the finished product... [and] a means for trimming the baked dough pieces\". These new pieces of prior art have been brought to the attention of the patent office through a reexamination proceeding. (See below)\n\nThe J.M. Smucker Co. also attempted to patent the \"process\" of making the sandwich in 2004 (rather than just the sandwich itself) and on April 8, 2005 had its application rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC)..\n\nIn 2001, a small grocery and caterer in Gaylord, Michigan, Albie's Food, Inc., was sent a cease and desist letter from The J.M. Smucker Co., accusing Albie's of violating their intellectual property rights to the \"sealed crustless sandwich\". Instead of capitulating, Albie's took the case to federal court, noting in their filings a pocket sandwich with crimped edges and no crust was called a \"pasty\" and had been a popular dish in northern Michigan since the nineteenth century. Federal Court determined that Albie's Foods did not infringe on J.M. Smucker Co. intellectual property rights and was allowed to continue, overturning J.M. Smucker Co. cease and desist.\n\nIn March 2001, during the legal proceedings, Albie's filed a request for reexamination with the USPTO asking that the patent be reexamined in light of the new prior art. The reexamination serial number is 90/005,949.\n\nIn response to the new prior art cited, Smucker's narrowed the wording of their claims to only cover a very specific version of their sealed crustless sandwich. The more narrow claims, for example, only cover sealed crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches where the jelly is held between two layers of peanut butter. Nonetheless, in December 2003, the patent examiner rejected the narrowed claims in light of the new prior art.\n\nSmucker's appealed the rejection to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI). In September 2006, The BPAI reversed the examiner's reasons for rejecting the claims, but found new reasons for rejecting them. They found that the wording in the narrowed claims was too vague to clearly identify exactly what Smucker's is trying to patent. Because Smucker's failed to respond to the BPAI's rejections within the two-month deadline, the PTO mailed a Notice of Intent to Issue a Reexamination Certificate (NIIRC) in December 2006 cancelling all claims. The reexamination certificate was issued on September 25, 2007.\n\n, Smucker's is selling the unpatented sandwiches under the \"Uncrustables\" trademark. The company built a plant in 2004 in Scottsville, Kentucky, to produce the product. The food item was utilized extensively during the 2018 California wildfires by firefighters; it has been a staple in the brown bags which food is handed out to firefighters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1605470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1605470", "title": "Satya", "text": "Satya\n\nSatya is the Sanskrit word for truth. It also refers to a virtue in Indian religions, referring to being truthful in one's thought, speech and action. In Yoga, \"satya\" is one of five yamas, the virtuous restraint from falsehood and distortion of reality in one's expressions and actions.\n\nIn the Vedas and later sutras, the meaning of the word satya () evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue. It means being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech and action.\n\nA related concept, sattva, also derived from \"sat\", means true essence, nature, spiritual essence, character. Sattva is also a guṇa, a psychology concept particularly in the Samkhya school of philosophy, where it means goodness, purity, clean, positive, one that advances good true nature of self.\n\nSatya has cognates in a number of diverse Indo-European languages, including the word \"sooth\" in English, \"istina\" (\"истина\") in Russian, \"sannhet\" in Norwegian and \"haithya\" in Avestan, the liturgical language of Zoroastrianism.\n\n\"Satya\" is a central theme in the Vedas. It is equated with and considered necessary to the concept Ṛta (Sanskrit ऋतं ṛtaṃ) – that which is properly joined, order, rule, nature, balance, harmony. Ṛta results from Satya in the Vedas, states Holdrege, as it regulates and enables the operation of the universe and everything within it. Satya (truth) is considered essential, and without it, the universe and reality falls apart, cannot function.\n\nIn Rigveda, opposed to \"rita\" and \"satya\" are \"anrita\" and \"asatya\" (falsehood). Truth and truthfulness is considered as a form of reverence for the divine, while falsehood a form of sin. \"Satya\" includes action and speech that is factual, real, true and reverent to \"Ṛta\" in Book 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Rigveda. However, \"Satya\" isn't merely about one's past that is in context in the Vedas, it has one's current and one's future contexts as well. De Nicolás states, that in Rigveda, \"\"Satya\" is the modality of acting in the world of \"Sat\", as the truth to be built, formed or established\".\n\n\"Satya\" is a widely discussed concept in various Upanishads, including the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad where \"satya\" is called the means to Brahman, as well as Brahman (Being, true self). In hymn 1.4.14 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, \"Satya\" (truth) is equated to Dharma (morality, ethics, law of righteousness), as\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad's hymn 11.11 states, \"Speak the Satya (truth), conduct yourself according to the Dharma (morality, ethics, law)\".\n\nTruth is sought, praised in the hymns of Upanishads, held as one that ultimately, always prevails. The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, states in Book 3, Chapter 1,\n\nSandilya Upanishad of Atharvanaveda, in Chapter 1, includes ten forbearances as virtues, in its exposition of Yoga. It defines Satya as \"the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well being of creatures, through the actions of one's mind, speech or body.\"\n\nDeussen states that \"Satya\" is described in the major Upanishads with two layers of meanings - one as empirical truth about reality, another as abstract truth about universal principle, being and the unchanging. Both these ideas are explained in early Upanishads, composed before 500 BC, by variously breaking the word \"satya\" or \"satyam\" into two or three syllables. In later Upanishads, the ideas evolve and transcend into \"satya\" as truth (or truthfulness), and Brahman as the Being, Be-ness, real Self, the eternal.\n\nThe \"Shanti Parva\" of the Mahabharata states, \"The righteous hold that forgiveness, truth, sincerity and compassion are the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the essence of the Vedas.\"\n\nThe Epic repeatedly emphasizes that \"Satya\" is a basic virtue, because everything and everyone depends on and relies on \"Satya\".\n\nIn the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, it is written, “When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him.\" In Yoga sutra, \"Satya\" is one of the five yamas, or\nvirtuous restraints, along with ahimsa (restraint from violence or injury to any living being); asteya (restraint from stealing); brahmacharya (celibacy or restraint from sexually cheating on one's partner); and aparigraha (restraint from covetousness and craving). Patanjali considers \"satya\" as a restraint from falsehood in one's action (body), words (speech, writing), or feelings / thoughts (mind). In Patanjali's teachings, one may not always know the truth or the whole truth, but one knows if one is creating, sustaining or expressing falsehood, exaggeration, distortion, fabrication or deception. \"Satya\" is, in Patanjali's Yoga, the virtue of restraint from such falsehood, either through silence or through stating the truth without any form of distortion.\n\nSatya is one of the five vows prescribed in Jain Agamas. Satya was also preached by Mahavira. According to Jainism, not to lie or speak what is not commendable. The underlying cause of falsehood is passion and therefore, it is said to cause \"hiṃsā\" (injury).\n\nAccording to the Jain text \"Sarvārthasiddhi\": \"\"that which causes pain and suffering to the living is not commendable, whether it refers to actual facts or not\"\".\n\nAccording to Jain text, \"Puruşārthasiddhyupāya\":\n\nThe term \"satya\" (Sanskrit; in Pali: \"sacca\") is translated in English as \"reality\" or \"truth.\" In terms of the Four Noble Truths (\"ariyasacca\"), the Pali can be written as \"sacca\", \"tatha\", \"anannatatha\" and \"dhamma\".\n\n'The Four Noble Truths' (\"ariya-sacca\") are the briefest synthesis of the entire teaching of Buddhism, since all those manifold doctrines of the threefold Pali canon are, without any exception, included therein. They are the truth of suffering (mundane mental and physical phenomenon), of the origin of suffering (tanha 'pali' the craving), of the extinction of suffering (Nibbana or nirvana), and of the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the extinction of suffering (the eight supra-mundane mind factors ).\n\nThe motto of the republic of India's emblem is Satyameva Jayate which is literally translated as 'Truth alone triumphs'.\n\n\n"}

A dish can be considered a national dish for a variety of reasons:\n\nNational dishes are part of a nation's identity and self-image. During the age of European empire-building, nations would develop a national cuisine to distinguish themselves from their rivals.\n\nAccording to Zilkia Janer, a lecturer on Latin American culture at Hofstra University, it is impossible to choose a single national dish, even unofficially, for countries such as Mexico, China or India because of their diverse ethnic populations and cultures. The cuisine of such countries simply cannot be represented by any single national dish. Furthermore, because national dishes are so interwoven into a nation's sense of identity, strong emotions and conflicts can arise when trying to choose a country's national dish.\n\nIn Latin America, dishes may be claimed or designated as a \"\"plato nacional\"\", although in many cases, recipes transcend national borders with only minor variations. Both Peru and Ecuador claim \"ceviche\" as their national dish. Stews of meat, plantains, and root vegetables are the \"platos nacionales\" of several countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean: Colombian \"ajiaco\", as well as the \"sancocho\" of the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Panama, are examples of platos nacionales. Janer (2008) observes that this sharing of the same \"plato nacional\" by different countries calls into question the idea that every country has a unique national dish that is special to that country; she states that cuisine does not respect national and geopolitical borders.\n\nThe identification of Latin American national dishes is stronger among expatriate communities in North America. In Latin American countries, the \"plato nacional\" is usually part of the cuisine of rural and peasant communities, and not necessarily part of the everyday cuisine of city dwellers. In expatriate communities, the dish is strongly reclaimed in order to retain the sense of national identity and ties to one's homeland, and is proudly served in homes and restaurants. By this show of national identity, the community can resist social pressures that push for homogenization of many ethnically and culturally diverse communities into a single all-encompassing group identity, such as Latino or Hispanic American.\n\nThis is not a definitive list of national dishes, but rather a list of some foods that have been suggested to be national dishes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA national liquor is an alcoholic drink considered a standard and respected adult beverage in a given country.

{"id": "1607102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1607102", "title": "Bumba Meu Boi", "text": "Bumba Meu Boi\n\nBumba Meu Boi is an interactive play celebrated in Brazil. It originated in the 18th Century and evolved into a nationwide festival. It is a form of social criticism. Lower class Brazilians mock and criticize those of higher social status through a comedic Folklore story told in song and dance. Though not as well known internationally as Carnival and other Brazilian festivals, it is older and deeply rooted in the culture of Brazil. The tale can vary depending on the region and social setting at which it is practiced. However, its essential theme remains the same, with a focus on the death and resurrection of a ox.\n\nThe principal figures include a ox, a white master (Cavalo Marinho, in Pernambuco), a black pregnant woman (Catirina), a Vaqueiro or cowboy (Mateus, Chico ou Pai Francisco), others vaqueiros (cowboys), índios, índias and caboclos (indigenous people), a priest, and a doctor (or indigenous healers). The audience is also a key component of the performance, as passionate responses from spectators provide a hectic atmosphere. Additionally, performers are known to become playfully physical with the audience, though with large consumptions of Cachaça (a Brazilian national alcoholic drink), violence can occasionally occur.\n\nToday, Bumba Meu Boi is separated into traditional, and modern practices. However, only the traditional forms can be found throughout the country. Both versions can be seen in Brazil from the 13th to the 29th of June, as well as from December 25th (Christmas) to January 6.\n\nMany different origins of Bumba Meu Boi have been proposed. However, the most commonly believed one is from mid-18th Century Brazil lower class communities that were left very little from the wealthy and forced to live dreadful lives. It was through these rough conditions that Bumba Meu Boi was born to bring joy to these deprived communities, as well as to provide men with an internal form of rebellion. These communities consisted of slaves and rural workers. So from the start, Bumba Meu Boi was created from people of mixed origins. This is significant because it cuts the festival from any racial ties.\n\nAs it became more popular throughout northeastern communities in the 19th Century, people began performing it for the entertainment of others, rather than merely for self-enjoyment. It was at this point that it evolved from a family affair to a communal one. This also made it more important within lower class Brazilians' social lives, as it brought everyone together. By the 20th Century the play became an annual and biannual event, transitioning to its modern form as a festival. Throughout the 20th century and the turn of the 21st Century, the fes tival experienced large amounts of popularization, spreading to all corners of the nation. This created large variations of the festival to form, depending on the central values of each community it is celebrated in. Today, its variations and the Brazilians that celebrate them can be sorted into two main categories of people. There are those who continue to celebrate the festival in its traditional forms, who mainly live in northern, northeastern, and Amazonian cities and villages, especially in Maranhão, though it also exists in central regions as well. These forms of the festival still maintain a large focus on the rebellious features of the play towards the upper class, providing Brazil's lower class with a strong cultural connection to Brazil's past. Then there are those who embrace its modern form, which is more constantly altering to modern trends and is aroused by the media. These forms of the festival allow Brazilians to embrace the more current, festive cultures of Brazil. Rationally, this form exists in more populated, modernized cities such as Rio de Janeiro, and is perceived by traditionalist to have lost the meaning of the celebration.\n\nThe oxl was placed as a centerpiece because, at the time, they saw as an animal of high economic regard due to its use in farming. Though, ox’s were also highly involved in colonial’s social lives, as bullfighting and calf-dancing were very popular. These are thought to have been passed down from lower class Portuguese families, as similar social activities can be traced back much further in Portugal.\n\nA literal translation for \"bumba my ox\" could be \"dance my ox\".\n\nThere are almost one hundred bumba-meu-boi groups in the state of Maranhão, subdivided in . Each sotaque (literally \"accent\") has its own characteristics that are manifested in clothes, in the choice of instruments, in the type of cadence of music and in choreographies. The sotaques are: matraca, zabumba, orquestra, from the Baixada Maranhense, and costa de mão, that appear especially in the month of June, in the Festas Juninas, in places called Arraiais.\n\nIt involves several characters as the owner of the farm (amo or master), Pai Francisco (vaqueiro, a cowboy, or a slave), his wife Catirina, cowboys (vaqueiros), índios, índias and caboclos (indigenous people), the ox and cazumbás. The plot recalls a typical history of the region's social and economic relations during the colonial period, marked by monoculture, extensive cattle breeding and slavery, mixing European, African and indigenous cultures.\n\nThe most famous groups of Maranhão are: Boi de Maracanã, Boi da Maioba and Boi da Pindoba (sotaque of matraca); Boi de Nina Rodrigues, Boi de Axixá, Boi de Morros, Boi de Rosário, Boi Brilho da Ilha and Boi Novilho Branco (sotaque of orquestra); Boi de Leonardo, Boi de Vila Passos, Boi da Fé em Deus, Boi Unidos Venceremos and Boi de Guimarães (sotaque of zabumba). Boi União da Baixada, Boi de Pindaré, Boi Unidos de Santa Fé and Boi Penalva do Bairro de Fátima (sotaque of Baixada); Boi Rama Santa, Boi Brilho da Sociedade, Boi Soledade and Boi Brilho da Areia Branca (sotaque costa de mão).\n\nThe bumba-meu-boi involves the devotion to the saints of June São João, São Pedro and São Marçal, and is the most important manifestation popular culture in the state, attracting thousands of people. The Feast of Saint Peter and Saint Marçal marks the end of the Festas Juninas. On the Feast of St. Peter (29/06), various groups of ox go to St. Peter's Chapel to thank the June season for blessings. On the feast of São Marçal (St. Martial, 30/06), there is a large \"batalhões\" of bumba meu boi of matraca (two small pieces of wood, beaten against each other, to produce the rhythm) in the neighborhood of João Paulo, in São Luís, capital of Maranhão.\n\nOther typical dances of Maranhão are: Cacuriá and Tambor de Crioula. The present model of presentation of the bumba meu boi in Maranhão does not tell all the story of the 'auto', replaced by a simplified story, with greater emphasis on songs (\"toadas\") and dances.\n\nFinding a single true plot behind the story of Bumba Meu Boi is near impossible due to all its variances throughout different communities in Brazil. However, the most common performance will go as follows: The Musical begins with the singing of the overture form the Chorus, who may sing a multitude of songs specifically for Bumba Meu Boi. Usually the first to walk into the room is Cavalo Marinho (or Amo, the owner of farm), wearing a costume that makes it appear as though he is riding a horse. He entertains the audience with rhythmic dancing until the Chorus announces of the entrance of important characters, such as a cowboy named Mateus (or Pai Francisco), who may have another cowboy with him named Birico. A pregnant woman named Catirina usually enters with the Cowboys. She is played by a man, which is almost always the same for all female roles in the performance. After a dance of their own, Catirina proclaims her need to consume the tongue of an ox or bull, for she fears her baby will die, or sometimes have certain birth defects if she doesn’t. The story follows Mateus (or Pai Francisco) as he leaves to find a ox. He has many comedic encounters with secondary characters, such as a giant and a donkey. In other forms of the story, the ox belongs to the village and there is no journey to find it.\n\nNext, the ox enters the room and the audience cheers, as it is the most beloved role. The ox may perform a number of dances, and often one known as \"Lundu\", which involved tap dancing. The ox is then killed, and the audience remorse’s and even cries. Often the ox is killed because it attacks the cowboys, Catirina, and the audience, or it happens by accident. Songs are then sung, mourning the death of the ox, followed by Mateus cutting out the ox’s tongue and offering it to Catirina. Next Cavalo Marinho (or Amo,the owner of the farm) re-enters and demands the capture of the one who killed the ox, as it is a useful animal to the farm. He also requests a doctor (or indigenous healers, the pajés,in Maranhão)to try to bring the ox back to life. Before doctors arrive, a priest arrives, to bless the ox and to simultaneously marry Mateus and Catirina. The story alters largely here; one or sometimes two doctors may come, to try a variety of comical procedures to save the ox. Witches are also known to come in some. All who attempt to save the ox are mocked by the audience. In Maranhão, when the indigenous healers (pajés) are summoned to save the ox, and when the ox resurrects mooing, they all participate in a huge feast to commemorate the miracle. In other forms a doctor places a special green leaf in the ox mouth. As the ox is revived, the audience cheer, sing songs of praise and dance around the ox. At some point in this final scene the Capitão do Mato or police arrives which is a man dress in a military outfit. He is then mocked by the Audience and by other characters in the play as well. Lastly the Farwell begins as the Chorus sings, and the performers dance, which can be well-mannered or offensive depending on the entertainers' opinion of the reactions of the audience to the performance.\n\nThe Band: Is typically positioned visually on the side of the stage or room, and is responsible for creating a beat for the performers to dance to. The band consists of String, air, and percussion. In Maranhão, there are also matracas, maracás, pandeirão, pandeiros and tambor onça and zabumbas (types of drum).\n\nThe Chorus: Is off-scene for all of the play and is responsible for the introduction of each character as they appear on-scene. Within the Chorus, the Violeiro, and Cantador are guitar players whose energy and speed of play is important to the atmosphere of the play. Additionally, they are responsible for the improvisation of new songs that go along with what is occurring in the musical, and the surrounding community.\n\nAmo: in Maranhão, represents the role of the owner of the farm, commands the group with the aid of a whistle and a maracá (maracá of the master) sings the principal toadas (songs).\n\nCavalo Marinho: In Pernambuco, he is the main character with the highest authority in the play and the first to arrive on-scene. He is typically white, representing a Portuguese heritage, and wears a naval captain's costume, including a colored coat with golden ornaments hanging from it. Also, red striped pants, a red satin ribbon across his chest (sometimes), and a crown made of paper, covered with small mirrors and ribbons. Additionally, he is seen carrying a sword and has a protruding addition to his costume, making it appear as though he is riding a horse.\n\nVaqueiros (Cowboys): These characters consist of Mateus (or Pai Francisco, in Maranhão), and often Birico or Sebastião. There may also be other cowboys as well, however, they are insignificant. Their role in the play is as energetic jokesters, who obey the orders of Cavalo Marinho, and are meant to arouse the audience with laughter and remarkable dancing. The Vaqueiros tend to mainly mock the roles of authority in the play such as the Cavalo Marinho, Doctor, Priest, and Capitão do Mato (police). Lastly, Mateus tends to be decorated with many noisy bells hanging from his clothes, and Birico will typically wear a mask, while both carry whips in hand.\n\nIndios, Indias and caboclos (indigenous people): have a mission to locate and arrest Pai Francisco. In the presentation of the bumba meu boi of Maranhão, they provide a beautiful visual effect due to the beauty of their clothes and the choreography they perform. Some groups, especially the sotaque de matraca have the royal caboclo, or caboclo de pena (feather), which is the greatest outfit of bumba meu boi. Caboclos de fita are pessoas with hats with colorful ribbon and they blend into the cowboys during a party.\n\nCatirina: As almost all female roles in Bumba Meu Boi, she is played by a man, as a black, provocative woman. She is also pregnant and the mistress of Pai Francisco/Mateus. She is also a comedic character, who is known to dance a frantic Samba. She is very significant in the story, as she is the one who requests the arrival of the bull for its tongue. Sometimes, a secondary female character comes out with Catirina, named Dona Joana. She is also a black woman played by a man, who normally wears amusing ornaments.\n\nPai Francisco, Chico or Mateus: Catirina's husband, vaqueiro (cowboy), dress in simpler clothes. His role is to provoke laughter in the audience. \n\nThe ox: one or two men under a structure usually made of bamboo, covered with colored fabric, such as velvet. The head can be a ox skull or a mask adorned with flowers, stars, and ribbons. The ox has the largest effect on the crowd, and its death and resurrection is the basic framework of the play. In Maranhão, it is called Miolo to the person responsible for the evolutions and choreographies of the ox.\n\nCapitão do Mato: An aggressive man wearing a military costume, who represents the authorities or the police. He is heavily mocked by the audience.\n\nPriest: Is played by a man wearing an elegant robe of sorts, usually with some type of religious symbol on it, such as a cross or Mary, the mother of Jesus. He Arrives on-scene to bless the dead bull, and the marry Mateus and Catirina. Like all characters of high social status, the Priest is heavily mocked and disrespected by the audience, and other comedic characters.\n\nDoctor: Is typically played by a one or many men wearing a higher class gown. His procedures to save the ox life are usually foolish and are all ridiculed by the crowd. In Maranhão, indigenous healers, the pajés, try to bring the ox back to life\n\nIn longer versions, where Mateus (or Chico or Pai Francisco) and Birico embark on a journey to find the ox, the secondary characters they stumble upon are usually two or three of the following:\n\nBurrinha or Zabelinha: This is a role of an unattractive woman riding a donkey, who tends to please the audience with a fast tap dance. Though the dance is impressive the character is meant to look unorthodox.\n\nGigante: This is the role of a giant played by a man wearing a mask made from calabash, with a big mouth, nose, and eyes to represent a giant. He also wears a large cotton wig and rides on a horse (similar consume design as Cavalo Marinho). The role is known for it character’s acrobatic dancing, music sounds like death screams, and forest sounds.\n\nCaboclinha: A man plays an Amerindian girl wearing a costume made of feathers, and rides a goat. She will often skillfully dismount from the goat and kills it with an arrow.\n\nEma: An exotic bird, played by a boy weighed down by a straw basket full of trash, who moves like a bird, flapping his arms about frantically.

{"id": "1608006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1608006", "title": "Mansaf", "text": "Mansaf\n\nMansaf () is a traditional Jordanian dish made of lamb cooked in a sauce of fermented dried yogurt and served with rice or bulgur.\n\nIt is a popular dish eaten throughout the Levant. It is the national dish of Jordan, and can also be found in Palestine, Iraq, Southern Syria and Saudi Arabia. The name of the dish comes from the term \"large tray\" or \"large dish\".\n\nThe original pastoralist Bedouin mansaf underwent significant changes in the 20th century. The dish is said to originally have been made with simply meat (camel or lamb), meat broth or ghee (clarified butter) and bread. Following the popularization of rice in northern Jordan in the 1920s, rice gradually was introduced into the dish, at first mixed with bulgur, and later on its own, until the dish reached its modern incarnation of being based on white rice. Similarly, the jamid sauce is a recent development, as the Bedouins did not historically feature jamid in their cooked dishes until their modern sedentarization.\n\nJameed is a hard dry yogurt that is prepared by the boiling of sheep or goat's milk, which is then left to dry and ferment. The mixture is later kept in a fine woven cheesecloth to make a thick yogurt. Salt is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more for a few days, which then becomes very dense and is shaped into round balls. The city of Al-Karak in Jordan has a reputation for producing the highest quality of jameed.\n\nA jameed broth is prepared and the pieces of lamb are cooked in it. The dish is served on a large platter with a layer of flatbread (markook or shrak) topped with rice and then meat, garnished with almonds and pine nuts, and then the creamy jameed sauce is poured on top of the dish.\n\nMansaf is associated with a traditional Jordanian culture based on an agro-pastoral lifestyle in which meat and yogurt are readily available. Mansaf is served on special occasions such as weddings, births and graduations, or to honor a guest, and on major holidays such as Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, Christmas, Easter and Jordan's Independence Day. It is traditionally eaten collectively from a large platter in the Bedouin and rural style, standing around the platter with the left hand behind the back and using the right hand instead of utensils.\n\nSince mansaf was originally popular among Bedouins, much of the traditions that they used with the dish still exist today. The tray containing mansaf is placed on a table where people gather around it while standing. Mansaf should be eaten with the use of a person's right hand only while the left is behind the person's back. The hand is used to create balls of rice and then the ball is placed in the mouth through the use of three fingers. It is frowned upon to blow on the ball of rice, no matter how hot. Many of these traditions are still used; however, it can also be eaten with spoons and plates.\n\nThough mansaf is frequently referred to as Jordan's \"national dish\", Massad states that mansaf is not a truly \"traditional\" dish, but is rather a more recent dish which was developed during the Hashemite-Mandatory era of the early 20th century, and then promulgated as a \"national\" dish following independence. Professor Joseph Massad notes that the current form of mansaf differs from the independence-era and Mandate-era recipes, but is portrayed by the state as a dish that is both national and a Bedouin tradition, despite it also historically being a dish of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighboring regions of Palestine and Syria.\n\nThe inhabitants of Al-Salt and Al-Karak are reputed to make the best mansaf in Jordan. Other variants of the dish also exist and are adapted to the regional tastes and circumstances. These include fish mansaf, found in the south around the port city of Aqaba. An urban, less ceremonial adaptation of mansaf using non-dried yogurt is called \"shakreyyeh\". It is sometimes cooked with poultry instead of lamb and is common in the northern part of Jordan.\n\n\n"}

Milk is kept in a fine woven cheesecloth to make a thick yogurt. Salt is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more and the outside of the yogurt-filled cheesecloth is rinsed with water to allow any remaining whey to seep through. After a few days of salting the yogurt, it becomes very dense and it can be removed from the cheesecloth and shaped into round balls. It is then set to dry for a few days. If it is dried in the sun it becomes yellow; if it is dried in the shade it remains white. It is important that the jameed is dry to the core because any dampness can spoil the preservation process. Jameed is the primary ingredient used to make mansaf, the national dish of Jordan.\n\nTraditionally, Bedouins supplied Jordanian markets with jameed and other sheep and goat dairy products. Jameed is used in Jordanian dishes such as fatta, mahashi and mansaf, the latter also being the national dish of Jordan. Karak, Jordan is famous for its high-quality jameed. It is used in other Jordanian dishes such as Kousa Mahshi, Kubbeh blabaniyyeh, Mjalaleh, Rashouf, Madgoga and er-Rgage.\n\nTraditionally, jameed was made in late spring and early summer when sheep's milk is most plentiful. The first step was shaking the yogurt in a leather bag made from sheep or goat leather to separate the butter. The left over butter milk was then reduced by boiling until it reached a consistency similar to Labaneh (thick yogurt). It could then be salted, shaped ito balls, and sun-dried. The dried balls could be preserved for months in sealed boxes without refrigeration as they were very low in moisture. Nowadays, people consume jameed for its flavour rather than lack of refrigeration.\n\n"}

Garibaldi made a popular visit to South Shields in England in 1854. The biscuit was first manufactured by the Bermondsey biscuit company Peek Freans in 1861 following the recruitment of Jonathan Carr, one of the great biscuit makers of Carlisle.

It is named after the 17th-century Welsh privateer of the Caribbean, Sir Henry Morgan who died on 25 August 1688. Since 2017, the label has used the slogan \"Live like the Captain.\"\n\nIn 1944, the Seagram Company, based in Canada, started producing rum under the name Captain Morgan Rum Company.\n\nSeagram CEO Samuel Bronfman purchased a distillery named Long Pond from the Jamaican government. Among the buyers of raw rum from the Long Pond distillery was a Kingston pharmacy named Levy Brothers. The Levy family had been purchasing raw rum, adding medicinal herbs and spices, aging, and bottling it. Bronfman liked the rum product and bought the rights to it.\n\nIn the 1950s the governments of both the United States and its Puerto Rico commonwealth territory instituted a number of job creation programs in Puerto Rico. Taxes on rum entering the contiguous 48 states from Puerto Rico were made lower than those on rum coming from foreign countries. At this time both Seagram and the Bacardi family built large new plants near San Juan. In 1985, Seagram sold its rum distillery and manufacturing facilities in Camuy and Arecibo—and doing business as \"Puerto Rican Destillers\"—to Destilería Serrallés, a Puerto Rican concern that had been producing the Don Q brand in Puerto Rico since 1865. As part of the contract Seagram also licensed to Serralles the rights to produce and distribute the \"Captain Morgan\" brand in Puerto Rico and the rest of the Caribbean until 2012.\n\nIn 2001, Seagram sold the \"Captain Morgan\" brand to Diageo. Diageo made an announcement on 24 June 2008, that it intends to build and operate a new rum distillery on St. Croix, Virgin Islands beginning in 2010 and to source from it beginning at the end of their current supply contract in 2012.\n\nIn 1984, Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum was introduced to the United States. Captain Morgan was, by volume, the second largest brand of spirits in the United States, and the seventh largest worldwide in 2007. , 7.6 million 9-litre cases were sold. Most Captain Morgan rum is sold in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, South Africa, and Global Travel.\n\nIn November 2009, the NFL banned a covert ad campaign allegedly put on by Diageo. It was understood that for each NFL player striking the \"Captain Morgan\" pose on camera during a regular season game, Diageo would donate $10,000 to the Gridiron Greats (a non-profit which helps retired NFL players with various hardships after leaving the game). The league made this announcement following such a celebration by Brent Celek of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn 2010 two American territories, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands bickered over plans for the Captain Morgan to move operations to the Virgin Islands for tax reasons. The matter came to a head during a debate in the United States Congress over the USVI's attempt to use tax benefits to lure the company to that territory.\n\nIn 2011, to bring it into line with the international version, Morgan's Spiced in the UK was rebranded as Captain Morgan's Spiced. This was accompanied by a large media campaign and parties hosted around the UK in clubs and bars to advertise the new rum. The \"Captain Morgan\" mascot was introduced along with \"Morganettes\".\n\nThe likeness of the Captain Morgan character was created by award-winning artist Don Maitz.\n\nCaptain Morgan's Rum is distilled from sugar cane. The combination of the type of yeasts employed for fermentation, distillation method, aging conditions, and blending determines the characteristic flavour of rum. Made with molasses, water, mash and yeast, \"Captain Morgan Original Spiced rum\" is distilled in a continuous still. Once distilled, the clear spirit is aged in oak barrels for up to a year, adding a golden colour and character to the rum before the flavours and spices are added.

{"id": "1621361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1621361", "title": "Pro-verb", "text": "Pro-verb\n\nIn grammar, a pro-verb is a word or phrase that stands in place of a verb (for example, in order that the verb not need to be repeated). It does for a verb what the more widely known pronoun does for a noun. It, along with pronouns and some other word classes, form the general group of word classes pro-forms. It is a type of anaphora. This term is always hyphenated, to distinguish it from the unrelated term proverb.\n\nEnglish does not have dedicated pro-verbs; however, a bare infinitive can generally be implied rather than expressed, such that the verbs that take bare infinitives (including most of the auxiliary verbs) can be said to double as pro-verbs. Additionally, \"have\" and \"be\" can double as pro-verbs for perfect, progressive, and passive constructions (by eliding the participle). Finally, the dummy auxiliary verb \"do\" can be used when there is no other auxiliary verb, except if the main verb is \"be\". The following are some examples of these kinds of pro-verb:\n\nNote that, when there are multiple auxiliary verbs, some of these may be elided as well. For example, in reply to \"Who's been leaving the milk out of the refrigerator?\", any of \"You've been doing it\", \"You have been\", or \"You have\" would have the same meaning.\n\nSince a to-infinitive is just the particle \"to\" plus a bare infinitive, and a bare infinitive can be elided, the particle \"to\" doubles as a pro-verb for a to-infinitive:\n\n\nFinally, even in dialects where bare infinitives and participles can be elided, there does exist the pro-verb \"do so\": \"He asked me to leave, so I did so\". This pro-verb, unlike the above-described pro-verbs, can be used in any grammatical context; however, in contexts where another pro-verb could be used, it can be overly formal. For example, in \"I want to get an 'A', but to do so, I need to get a perfect score on the next test,\" there is no other pro-verb that could be used; whereas in \"I want to get an 'A', but I can't do so,\" the \"do so\" could simply be elided, and doing so would make the sentence sound less formal.\n\n"}

A common dish in the North East of England, it is consumed to a lesser extent in the rest of Britain, as well as in Newfoundland, Canada.\n\nPease pudding is typically thick, somewhat similar in texture to (but perhaps a little more solid than) hummus, and is light yellow in colour, with a mild taste. Pease pudding is traditionally produced in England, especially in the industrial North Eastern areas. It is often served with ham or bacon, beetroot and stottie cakes. It is also a key ingredient in the classic saveloy dip which consists of a bread roll spread with pease pudding on one half, sage and onion stuffing on the other with a slight smear of mustard, and a saveloy sausage cut in half, which is then dipped gently into either the stock that the saveloys are boiled in or gravy. Only the top half is usually dipped as not to make it difficult to hold or eat. These are still available today in what are known locally in the North East of England as \"pork shops\". In Southern England, it is usually served with faggots. Also in Southern England is the small village of Pease Pottage which, according to tradition, gets its name from serving pease pottage to convicts either on their way from London to the South Coast, or from East Grinstead to Horsham.\n\nPeasemeal brose, also known as brosemeal, is a traditional breakfast dish in the north of Scotland. In Scotland it is made in the traditional way and usually eaten with butter, and either salt or honey.\nIn parts of the Midlands, it replaces mushy peas as a traditional accompaniment to fish and chips and is thought to be the original side order, only to be later replaced with mushy peas due to a lack of knowledge or availability of the dish.\n\nThe dish is a traditional part of Jiggs dinner in Newfoundland, Canada.\n\nIn German-speaking countries, pease pudding is known under the name Erbspüree or Erbsenpüree. Alternative regional names are Erbsbrei or Erbsmus. It is especially widespread in the traditional cuisine of the German capital Berlin. The best-known German dish which is traditionally served with pease pudding is Eisbein.\n\nIn Beijing cuisine, Wandouhuang (豌豆黄) is a sweetened and chilled pease pudding made with yellow split peas or shelled mung beans, sometimes flavoured with sweet osmanthus blossoms and dates. A refined version of this snack is said to have been a favourite of Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\nIn Greek cuisine, a similar dish is called Fava (Φάβα). Despite the name, it is usually made from yellow split peas, not Fava beans. The mashed peas are usually drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped raw onions.\n\nGenerally recipes for pease pudding involve steeping soaked split yellow peas in stock (traditionally ham hock stock) and cooking them for around 40 minutes. The resulting mush is then blended with other ingredients, which depend on the variation. The oldest known written recipe for something similar to pease pudding involves saffron, nutmeg and a little cinnamon in the blending process; modern recipes sometimes beat in an egg at this point to act as an extra binding agent.\n\nPease pudding is featured in a nursery rhyme, \"Pease Porridge Hot\".\n\nIn \"The Princess and the Goblin\", Curdie takes bread and pease pudding with him for sustenance when he goes to spy on the King's house.\n"}

Unleavened breads are generally flat breads; however, not all flat breads are unleavened. Unleavened breads, such as the tortilla and roti, are staple foods in Central America and South Asia, respectively.\n\nUnleavened breads have symbolic importance in Judaism and Christianity. Jews consume unleavened breads such as matzo during Passover - various traditions explain this usage. Unleavened bread also features in some Western Christian liturgies during the Eucharist, a rite derived from the Last Supper when Jesus broke bread, naturally believed to have also been matzo, with his disciples during a Passover Seder.\n\nCanon Law of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church mandates the use of unleavened bread for the Host, and unleavened wafers for the communion of the faithful. The more liturgical Protestant churches tend to follow the Latin Catholic practice, whereas others use either unleavened bread or wafers or ordinary (leavened) bread, depending on the traditions of their particular denomination or local usage.\n\nOn the other hand, most Eastern Churches explicitly forbid the use of unleavened bread (Greek: \"azymos artos\") for the Eucharist. Eastern Christians associate unleavened bread with the Old Testament and allow only for bread with yeast, as a symbol of the New Covenant in Christ's blood. Indeed, this usage figures as one of the three points of contention that traditionally accounted as causes (along with the issues of Petrine supremacy and the \"filioque\" in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed) of the Great Schism of 1054 between Eastern and Western churches.\n\n"}

It is seldom used for pancake or waffle syrup, more often it is used as an ingredient paired with pork or salmon dishes in sauces, glazes, and dressings, and as a flavoring in ice cream, beer, wine, and soft drinks. It is condensed from the sap, which has about 0.5–2% percent sugar content, depending on the species of birch, location, weather, and season. The finished syrup is 66% sugar or more to be classified as a syrup. Birch sap sugar is about 42–54% fructose and 45% glucose, with a small amount of sucrose and trace amounts of galactose. The flavor of birch syrup has a distinctive and mineral-rich caramel-like taste that is not unlike molasses or balsamic condiment or some types of soy, with a hint of spiciness. Different types of birch will produce slightly different flavour profiles; some more copper, others with hints of wildflower honey. Many people remark that while Birch syrup has the same sugar content of maple it is far more savory than sweet. \n\nMaking birch syrup is more difficult than making maple syrup, requiring about 100–150 liters of sap to produce one liter of syrup (more than twice that needed for maple syrup). The tapping window for birch is generally shorter than for maple, primarily because birches live in more northerly climates. It also happens later in the year than maple tapping. The trees are tapped and their sap collected in the spring (generally mid- to late April, about two to three weeks before the leaves appear on the trees). The common belief is that while birches have a lower trunk and root pressure than maples, pipeline or tubing method of sap collection used in large maple sugaring operations is not as useful in birch sap collection. However Rocky Lake Birchworks in The Pas, Manitoba is successfully using the tubing method along with a vacuum system for collection of birch sap. \n\nThe sap is reduced in the same way as maple sap, using reverse osmosis machines and evaporators in commercial production. While maple sap may be boiled down without the use of reverse osmosis, birch syrup is difficult to produce this way: the sap is more temperature sensitive than is maple sap because fructose burns at a lower temperature than sucrose, the primary sugar in maple sap. This means that boiling birch sap to produce syrup can much more easily result in a scorched taste.\n\nMost birch syrup is produced in Russia, Alaska and Canada from Paper Birch or Alaska Birch sap (\"Betula papyrifera\" var. \"humilis\" and \"neoalaskana\"). These trees are found primarily in interior and south central Alaska. The Kenai birch (\"Betula papyrifera\" var. \"kenaica\"), which is also used, grows most abundantly on the Kenai Peninsula, but is also found in the south central part of the state and hybridizes with \"humilis\". The southeast Alaska variety is the Western paper birch, (\"Betula papyrifera\" var. \"commutata\") and has a lower sugar content. One litre of syrup from these trees requires evaporation of approximately 130–150 litres of sap.\n\nTotal production of birch syrup in Alaska is approximately 3,800 liters (1,000 U.S. gallons) per year, with smaller quantities made in other U.S. states and Canada (also from Paper Birch), Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Scandinavia (from other species of birch). Because of the higher sap-to-syrup ratio and difficulties in production, birch syrup is more expensive than maple syrup, up to five times the price.\n\n\n"}

The snack was designed to be easily eaten on the move without a plate or cutlery. Since 1995 they have been owned by Simplot Australia.\n\nA Chiko Roll's filling is primarily cabbage and barley, as well as carrot, green beans, beef, beef tallow, wheat cereal, celery and onion. This filling is partially pulped and enclosed in a thick egg and flour pastry tube designed to survive handling at football matches. The roll is typically deep-fried in vegetable oil.\n\nAt the peak of its popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, 40 million Chiko Rolls were sold annually in Australia. The product has been described as an Australian cultural icon.\n\nOther products currently available under the Chiko brand include Corn Jacks, Hawaiian and Supreme pizza subs, Spudsters, onion rings, fish cakes and vegetable nuggets.\n\nThe Chiko Roll was developed by Frank McEncroe, a boilermaker from Bendigo, Victoria, who turned to catering at football matches and other outdoor events. In 1950, McEncroe saw a competitor selling Chinese chop suey rolls outside the Richmond Cricket Ground and decided to add a similar product to his own line. McEncroe felt that the Chinese rolls were too flimsy to be easily handled in an informal outdoor setting and hit upon the idea of a much larger and more robust roll that would provide a quick meal that was both reasonably substantial and easily handled. The result was the Chiko Roll, which debuted at the Wagga Wagga Agriculture Show in 1951.\n\nIn the 1960s, McEncroe moved to Melbourne with his family where he began to manufacture the rolls with the use of an adapted sausage machine. As the product became more popular, McEncroe moved his production to a larger factory in the suburb of Essendon. He later merged his business with a local company called Floyd's Iceworks to form Frozen Food Industries Pty Ltd. The new company went public in 1963.\n\nBy 1965, most Australian takeaway restaurants, especially milk bars and fish and chip shops carried Chiko Rolls, with the marketing slogan \"Grab a Chiko\" signifying the ease with which shop owners could take a Chiko Roll from the freezer and put it into a fryer, usually add a sauce and slide it into its own trademarked bag. At the height of their popularity in the 1970s, 40 million Chiko Rolls were being sold Australia-wide each year and more than one million were exported to Japan.\n\nSince 1995, the Chiko brand has been owned by Simplot Australia. All Chiko Rolls are now manufactured in Bathurst, New South Wales, on a specifically designed machine that produces the pastry and filling at the same time in long rolls. They are then automatically sliced and then the distinctive ends are folded.\n\nIncreasing competition in the Australian takeaway food market in recent decades has seen a decline in the profile of the Chiko Roll, with consumption down to 17 million per annum in 2011. However, they remain a popular snack at sporting events and are still widely available at fish and chip shops and supermarkets across Australia.\n\nIn September 2016 a disagreement in the Parliament of New South Wales over the origins of the Chiko Roll occurred. The Nationals' Member for Calare Andrew Gee, Labor’s Member for Bendigo Lisa Chesters and Member for Riverina Michael McCormack all claimed the snack originated in their respective hometowns.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Chiko Roll the current manufacturer presented gold-plated replicas to Bendigo and Wagga Wagga cities.\n\nIn October 2016 Karratha resident Mark Habermehl cooked a meat pie and a Chiko Roll on a barbeque in an attempt to avoid washing dishes. The event made the local newspaper and prompted a nomination for Australian of the Year, recognising the 'Australian-ness' of his choice of cuisine, selection of cooking device and ingenuity.\n\nSince the 1950s, Chiko Rolls have been advertised featuring the \"Chiko Chick\" character, a seductive woman on a motorbike accompanied by the slogan \"Couldn't you go a Chiko Roll?\" During the early 1980s, the accompanying slogan \"You can't knock the roll\" was used.\n\nIn 2008, the company began a nationwide search for the new \"Chiko Chick\", hoping to downplay the traditionally raunchy look in favour of a more wholesome \"girl next door\" image. On 17 July 2008, the new advertising poster was unveiled at the Wagga Wagga Showgrounds featuring Annette Melton as the new face.\n\n"}
{"id": "1637923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1637923", "title": "Relative pronoun", "text": "Relative pronoun\n\nA relative pronoun marks a relative clause; it has the same referent in the main clause of a sentence that the relative modifies. \n\nAn example is the word \"that\" in the sentence \"This is the house that Jack built.\" Here the relative pronoun \"that\" marked the relative clause \"that Jack built,\" which modifies the noun \"house\" in the main sentence. \"That\" has an anaphoric relationship to its antecedent \"house\" in the main clause.\n\nIn English the following are the most common relative pronouns: which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who and whom.\n\nIn linking a subordinate clause and a main clause, a relative pronoun functions similarly to a subordinating conjunction. Unlike a conjunction, however, a relative pronoun does not simply mark the subordinate (relative) clause, but also plays the role of a noun within that clause. For example, in the relative clause \"that Jack built\" given above, the pronoun \"that\" functions as the object of the verb \"built.\" Compare this with \"Jack built the house after he married,\" where the conjunction \"after\" marks the subordinate clause \"after he married\", but does not play the role of any noun within that clause. \n\nFor more information on the formation and uses of relative clauses—with and without relative pronouns—see Relative clause. For detailed information about relative clauses and relative pronouns in English, see English relative clause.\n\nThe element in the main clause that the relative pronoun in the relative clause stands for (\"house\" in the above example) is the \"antecedent\" of that pronoun. In most cases the antecedent is a nominal (noun or noun phrase), though the pronoun can also refer to a whole proposition, as in \"The train was late, which annoyed me greatly\", where the antecedent of the relative pronoun \"which\" is the clause \"The train was late\" (the thing that annoyed me was the fact of the train's being late). \n\nIn a free relative clause, a relative pronoun has no antecedent: the relative clause itself plays the role of the co-referring element in the main clause. For example, in \"I like what you did\", \"what\" is a relative pronoun, but without an antecedent. The clause \"what you did\" itself plays the role of a nominal (the object of \"like\") in the main clause. A relative pronoun used this way is sometimes called a fused relative pronoun, since the antecedent appears fused into the pronoun (\"what\" in this example can be regarded as a fusion of \"that which\").\n\nNot all relative clauses contain relative pronouns. Some languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, do not have relative pronouns at all, and form relative clauses (or their equivalents) by different methods. English can also make relative clauses without relative pronouns in some cases. For example, in \"The man you saw yesterday was my uncle\", the relative clause \"you saw yesterday\" contains no relative pronoun. It can be said to have a gap, or zero, in the position of the object of the verb \"saw\".\n\nOther arguments can be relativised using relative pronouns:\n\nIn some languages with gender, number, and noun declensions—such as German, Serbo-Croatian, and Latin—the relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number, while its case indicates its relationship with the verb in the relative or main clause. In some other languages, the relative pronoun is an invariable word.\n\nWords used as relative pronouns often originally had other functions. For example, the English \"which\" is also an interrogative word. This suggests that relative pronouns might be a fairly late development in many languages. Some languages, such as Welsh, have no relative pronouns.\n\nIn English, different pronouns are sometimes used if the antecedent is a human being, as opposed to a non-human or an inanimate object (as in \"who\" vs. \"that\"). \n\nWith the relative pronouns, sentences (1) and (2) would read like this:\n\nIn sentences (3) and (4), the words \"that\" and \"who\" are the relative pronouns. The word \"that\" is used because the bank is a thing; the word \"who\" is used because the teller is a person. Alternatively, \"which\" is often used in \"defining\" (or \"restrictive\") relative clauses in either case. For details see English relative clauses.\n\n\n"}

A bindi is a small, ornamental, devotional dot applied to the forehead in Hinduism.\n\nIn metaphysics, Bindu is considered the point at which creation begins and may become unity. It is also described as \"the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state\". Bindu is the point around which the mandala is created, representing the universe.\n\nBindu is often merged with [seed] (or sperm) and ova. In the \"Yoga Chudamani Upanishad\" Bindu is a duality, with a white Bindu representing \"shukla\" (pure) and a red Bindu representing \"maharaj\" (mastery). The white Bindu resides in the \"bindu visarga\" and is related to Shiva and the Moon, while the red Bindu resides in the \"muladhara\" chakra and is related to Shakti and the Sun. In yoga, the union of these two parts results in the ascension of kundalini to the sahasrara.\n\nIn Tantra, Bindu (or \"Bindu visarga\"—\"falling of the drop\") is a point at the back of the head where Brahmins grow their tuft of hair. This point is below the sahasrara chakra and above the ajna chakra, and is represented by a crescent moon with a white drop. It represents the manifestation of creations such as consciousness.\n\nThe \"Bindu visarga\" is said to be the source of Bindu fluid, which contains a nectar (\"amrita\") and a poison. The fluid is released from the \"Bindu visarga\", and can be stored in the lalana chakra and purified in the Vishuddha chakra. When the Vishuddha is inactive the fluid flows to the manipura chakra, where it is consumed (leading to physical decline). According to the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\", a hatha yoga practitioner can prolong their life by controlling the flow of the fluid. Through practice of Khecari mudra, a practitioner can manipulate the flow of the fluid from the lalana to the Vishuddha (where it is purified to amrita).\n\nThe picture of the chakra is a lotus with 23 petals. Its symbol is the moon, which supports the growth of vegetation. Krishna said in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" XV/13, \"Becoming the nectarine moon I nourish all plants\". Its divinity is Shiva, who is portrayed with the crescent moon in his hair.\n\nThe Bindu chakra is a centre for health, giving us the power for physical and mental recuperation. It benefits eyesight, quietens the emotions and promotes inner harmony, clarity and balance. With the help of this chakra we are capable of controlling hunger and thirst, gaining the ability to overcome unhealthy eating habits. Concentration on Bindu relieves anxiety and depression, nervousness and feelings of oppression in the heart.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism Bindu refers to the subtle body, which is composed of drops (Tibetan: ཐིག་ལེ \"thig le\") and winds (Tibetan: རླུང \"rLung\").\n\nExercises for the Bindu Chakra are:\n\nThere are also special Meditations on the Bindu Chakra.\n\n\n\n"}

Wheatgrass is served freeze dried or fresh, and so it differs from wheat malt, which is convectively dried. Wheatgrass is allowed to grow longer and taller than wheat malt. \n\nLike most plants, wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, amino acids, minerals, vitamins and enzymes. Claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass range from providing supplemental nutrition to having unique curative properties, but these claims have not been scientifically proven.\n\nWheatgrass juice is often available at juice bars, and some people grow and juice their own in their homes. It is available fresh as produce, in tablets, frozen juice, and powder. Wheatgrass is also sold commercially as a spray, cream, gel, massage lotion, and liquid herbal supplement. Because it is extracted from wheatgrass sprouts, i.e. before the wheat seed or \"berry\" used in flour begins to form, wheatgrass juice is gluten-free, but some dietitians recommend that those with celiac disease avoid it due to a high risk of cross contamination.\n\nThe consumption of wheatgrass in the Western world began in the 1930s as a result of experiments conducted by Charles Schnabel in his attempts to popularize the plant. By 1940, cans of Schnabel's powdered grass were on sale in major drug stores throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nAnn Wigmore was also a strong advocate for the consumption of wheatgrass as a part of a raw food diet. Wigmore, founder of the Hippocrates Health Institute, believed that wheatgrass, as a part of a raw food diet, would cleanse the body of toxins while providing a proper balance of nutrients as a whole food. She also taught that wheatgrass could be used to treat those with serious ailments.\n\nWheatgrass can be grown indoors or outdoors. A common method for sprout production indoors is often on trays in a growth medium such as a potting mix. Leaves are harvested when they develop a \"split\" as another leaf emerges. These can then be cut off with scissors and allow a second crop of shoots to form. Sometimes a third cutting is possible, but may be tougher and have fewer sugars than the first.\n\nSchnabel's research was conducted with wheatgrass grown outdoors in Kansas. His wheatgrass required 200 days of slow growth, through the winter and early spring, when it was harvested at the jointing stage. He claimed that at this stage the plant reached its peak nutritional value; after jointing, concentrations of chlorophyll, protein, and vitamins decline sharply. Wheatgrass grown is harvested, dehydrated at a low temperature and sold in tablet and powdered concentrates for human and animal consumption. Indoor grown wheatgrass is used to make wheatgrass juice powder.\n\nProponents of wheatgrass make many claims for its health properties, ranging from promotion of general well-being to cancer prevention. However, according to the American Cancer Society, \"available scientific evidence does not support the idea that wheatgrass or the wheatgrass diet can cure or prevent disease\". Some research was done on drug-induced diabetic rates, suggesting it has an insulin raising effect in type two diabetic rats. \n\nWheatgrass is a source of potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E (alpha tocopherol), vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium. Wheatgrass is also a source of protein (less than one gram per 28 grams). \n\nThe nutrient content of wheatgrass juice is roughly equivalent to that of dark leafy vegetables (see table 1).\n\n\n"}

The origins of the stew are currently unknown. The states of Virginia and Georgia both make claims for originating the stew, in addition to claims of a German origin.\n\nRecipes for Brunswick stew vary greatly, but it is usually a tomato-based stew, containing various types of lima beans/butter beans, corn, okra, and other vegetables, and one or more types of meat. Claims of authenticity call for squirrel, rabbit or possum meat, but chicken is most commonly used in modern versions. Some versions have a distinctly smoky taste. Eastern North Carolina Brunswick Stew has potatoes, which thicken it considerably. Eastern Virginia Brunswick Stew tends to be thinner, with more tomato flavor and less smoky flavor.\n\nThe main differences between the Georgia and Virginia versions have been the types of meat used. Tradition favors squirrel in early versions of both. The Virginia version tends to favor chicken as the primary meat, along with rabbit. The Georgia version tends to favor pork and beef. As there is no \"official\" recipe for Brunswick stew, it is possible to find chicken, pork, beef, and other types of meat included in the same recipe. North Carolina natives have been known for their unique concoction, similarly thick and tomato based, using chicken chunks (meat and skin, dark meat preferred) and pulled Eastern North Carolina–style barbecue (pork) as the meat.\n\nSquirrel Brunswick stew instructions are found in \"James Beard's American Cookery\".\n\nBrunswick County, Virginia, and the city of Brunswick, Georgia, both claim to be the origin of the stew.\n\nA plaque on an old iron pot in Brunswick, Georgia, says the first Brunswick stew was made in it on July 2, 1898, on nearby St. Simons Island. A competing story claims a Virginia state legislator's chef invented the recipe in 1828 on a hunting expedition.\n\nMarjorie Kinnan Rawlings, in her \"Cross Creek Cookery\" (1942), wrote that the stew, said to have been one of Queen Victoria's favorites, may have come from the original Brunswick: Braunschweig, Germany.\n\nList of stews\n\n"}

{"id": "1641735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1641735", "title": "Dioecy", "text": "Dioecy\n\nDioecy (Greek: διοικία \"two households\"; adjective form: dioecious) is a characteristic of a species, meaning that it has distinct male and female individual organisms. Dioecious reproduction is biparental reproduction. Dioecy is one method that excludes self-fertilization and promotes allogamy (outcrossing), and thus tends to reduce the expression of recessive deleterious mutations present in a population. Flowering plants have several other methods of excluding self-fertilization, called self-incompatibility.\n\nIn zoology, dioecious species may be opposed to hermaphroditic species, meaning that an individual is of only one sex, in which case the synonym gonochory is more often used. Dioecy may also describe colonies, such as the colonies of Siphonophorae (Portuguese man-of-war), which may be either dioecious within a species or monoecious. Dioecious colonies contain members of only one sex, whereas monoecious colonies contain members of both sexes.\n\nMost animal species are dioecious (gonochoric).\n\nDioecious species have the male and female reproductive structures on separate plants.\nThe meaning of \"male\" and \"female\" in the context of plants is different from that used in animal groups and the usage is not strictly correct. This issue is discussed below in the Alternation of generations section. About 6 percent of angiosperm species are entirely dioecious and about 7% of angiosperm genera contain some dioecious species. Examples of dioecious plant species include ginkgos, willows, cannabis and African teak. More examples of dioecious plants can be found in the Wikipedia category, .\n\nDioecy occurs in a wide variety of plant families. However it is more common in woody plants and heterotrophic species.Certain algae are dioecious. \n\nThere are several alternatives to dioecy for sexual reproductive structure organization in plants including bisexual flowers, monoecy, gynomonoecy, andromonoecy. These are described at Plant reproductive morphology.\n\nLand plants have alternation of generations, for which the sporophyte generation produces spores rather than gametes. Strictly speaking, the sporophytes of land plants do not have either male or female reproductive organs. The gametophytes of flowering plants are of a single sex; the male gametophytes are contained within the pollen, and the female gametophytes are contained within ovules. The sporophyte generation is called dioecious when each sporophyte has only one kind of spore-producing organ whose spores ultimately give rise to either all male gametes (sperm) or all female gametes (eggs). Slightly different terms, \"dioicous\" and \"monoicous\", may be used for the gametophyte generation, although \"dioecious\" and \"monoecious\" are also used.\n\nMonoecy and dioecy in fungi refer to the donor and recipient roles in mating, where a nucleus is transferred from one haploid hypha to another, and the two nuclei then present in the same cell merge by karyogamy to form a zygote. The definition avoids reference to male and female reproductive structures, which are rare in fungi. An individual of a dioecious fungal species not only requires a partner for mating, but performs only one of the roles in nuclear transfer, as either the donor or the recipient. A monoecious fungal species can perform both roles, but may not be self-compatible.\n\nDioecy has a demographic disadvantage compared with hermaphroditism: only about half of reproductive adults produce seeds. It is commonly assumed that dioecious species must therefore have fitness advantages to compensate for this cost through increased survival, growth, or reproduction. In trees, compensation is realized mainly through increased seed production by females. This in turn is facilitated by a lower contribution of reproduction to population growth, which results in no demonstrable net costs of having males in the population compared to being hermaphroditic. Dioecy may also accelerate or retard lineage diversification in angiosperms. Dioecious lineages are more diversified in certain genera, but less in others. An analysis suggested that dioecy neither consistently places a strong brake on diversification, nor strongly drives it.\n\n"}

Originally it may have referred simply to the hooded portion of a cloak. In contemporary usage, however, it is distinguished from a cloak or cape (\"cappa\") by the fact that it refers to an entire closed garment. Today it is worn primarily by most Catholic and Anglican monks when participating in liturgical services.\n\nDeveloped during the early Middle Ages in Northern Europe, they became the formal garment for those in monastic life. Originally they were worn simply to give greater warmth than would an open cloak to people who regularly spent long hours in unheated and draughty churches.\n\nThe cowl is traditionally bestowed upon the monk at the time of making solemn, or lifetime, profession. Prior to their solemn vows, the monks still in training wear a hooded cloak. The cowl is generally worn in conformity with the color of the monk's tunic, with the Benedictines wearing black, and other groups which follow the Rule of St. Benedict, e.g., the Camaldolese and Cistercians, wearing differing shades of white. Though not Benedictines, the Carthusians make use of a cowl as well. The Camaldolese of Monte Corona, however, always wear a cloak instead of a cowl.\n\nWhile not cowls in the monastic sense, the mendicant Orders have retained the use of a \"cappa\" (cape) as part of their habit. In their case, however, it is a regular part of their religious habit and worn by all members of the Order, both as street dress and in church. The Carmelites wear a white cape, although their tunic and scapular are brown, from which they were known in medieval England as the \"Whitefriars\". Dominicans wear a black cape over a white habit—hence, their ancient nickname of \"Blackfriars\". Both the cowl and the cape, though without a hood, are also worn by the nuns associated to each Order, in the same manner.\nAmong the Eastern Christians (Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic) the monastic hood developed into the \"koukoulion\" worn by monks of the Great Schema, the highest degree of monasticism in the Eastern Church. Currently the \"koukoulion\" is of two types: one is similar to the hood still worn by some Western monastic orders, the other takes the form of a stiff rounded hat (like a bowler hat without a rim) to which is attached an epanokalimavkion (veil with lappets). The koukoulion is usually embroidered with crosses and the Instruments of the Passion. The \"koukoulion\" is also worn by the Patriarchs of some of the autocephalous Orthodox churches.\n\n\n"}

In some countries, the prepared topping is marketed as bruschetta.\n\nIn Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled. The dish was developed as a way of salvaging bread that was going stale.\nIn Tuscany it is called \"fettunta\" and it is usually served without toppings, especially in November, to taste the first oil of the season.\n\nBruschetta originated in Italy during 16th century.

Variations of the sandwich include the substitution of wheat bread and the addition of various sweet, salty, and savory ingredients. The term \"fluffernutter\" can also be used to describe other food items, primarily desserts, that incorporate peanut butter and marshmallow creme.\n\nThe sandwich was first created in the early twentieth century after marshmallow creme, a sweet marshmallow-like spread, was invented in Massachusetts. During World War I, a recipe for a peanut butter and marshmallow creme sandwich, the earliest known example of the sandwich, was published. The term “fluffernutter” was created by an advertising agency in 1960 as a more effective way to market the sandwich.\n\nThe sandwich is particularly popular in New England and has been proposed as the official state sandwich of Massachusetts.\n\nA fluffernutter is made by spreading peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading an equal amount of marshmallow creme on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow creme on top.\n\nThe term \"fluffernutter\" has also been used to describe other foods that feature peanut butter and marshmallow creme, including Fluffernutter cookies, bars, and cupcakes. Durkee-Mower, the company that produces Marshmallow Fluff, a brand of marshmallow creme, produces a cookbook that features recipes for Fluffernutter bars, frosting, pie, and a shake. In 2006, Brigham's Ice Cream and Durkee-Mower introduced a Fluffernutter flavor, which featured peanut butter and Marshmallow Fluff in vanilla ice cream. Fluffernutter was also the name of a candy briefly produced by the Boyer Brothers candy company beginning in 1969.\n\nMarshmallow creme, one of the two main ingredients of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the \"Liberty Sandwich\", which consisted of peanut butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.\n\nMeanwhile, sugar shortages during World War I hurt sales of Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues to sell the product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow creme continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. \"Fluffernutter\" is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the \"Fluffernutter\" name.\n\nIn June 2006, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios gained national attention when he proposed legislation restricting the serving of Fluffernutter sandwiches in public schools. After Barrios learned that his son was served Fluffernutters on a daily basis at his Cambridge, Massachusetts, public elementary school, he created an amendment to a junk food bill that aimed to limit the serving of Fluffernutters in Massachusetts public schools to once a week. The proposal was criticized as an example of trivial and overly intrusive legislation, while Barrios' supporters pointed to concerns over the problem of childhood obesity. Among the people who defended the Fluffernutter at the time was Massachusetts State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein, whose district in Revere was close to Lynn, where Marshmallow Fluff is made. She claimed she planned to \"fight to the death for Fluff\" and supported legislation that would make the Fluffernutter the official state sandwich. The measure failed, and Reinstein tried again unsuccessfully in 2009. Supporters of the bill cited the sandwich's close association with childhood and Massachusetts.\n\nThe term \"fluffernutter\" has sometimes been used disparagingly to describe something that lacks substance and has minimal to no cultural value. On the other hand, some writers look on Fluffernutters and marshmallow creme as a source of childhood nostalgia and regional pride.\n\nThe sandwich has close ties to New England, particularly to Somerville, where Archibald Query invented Marshmallow Fluff, and to Lynn, where Durkee-Mower has produced it for decades. Somerville holds an annual festival called What the Fluff? based around celebrating Marshmallow Fluff and Fluffernutter sandwiches. The festival incorporates music, visual art, games, and a cooking contest based around Fluff and Fluffernutters. In 2011, NASA astronaut Richard Michael Linnehan, who was born in Lowell, and ate a Fluffernutter while aboard the International Space Station, acted as one of the contest judges.\n\nOctober 8 is National Fluffernutter Day.\n\n\n"}

The brand is aimed at competing with The Coca-Cola Company's Sprite brand and Dr Pepper Snapple Group's 7 Up.\n\nPepsiCo began test-marketing potential lemon-lime sodas in 1998, introducing a formulation known as Storm that never made it past the test-marketing stage. Prior lemon-lime sodas from PepsiCo included Teem, which had been introduced in 1960 but discontinued in 1984, when they introduced the Slice line of fruit-flavored sodas, which launched with a lemon-lime flavor. The company introduced Sierra Mist in 1999. The selection of the name \"Sierra Mist\" was based on favorable market research involving 2,000 people from over 1,000 possible names. \"Sierra\" had previously been a proposed name for what became the original (10% juice-formula, lemon-lime) Slice in 1984. \"Diet Sierra Mist\" was also introduced in 2000, and sales of both diet and original Sierra Mist totaled $100 million in its first year of production. Many PepsiCo bottlers continued to bottle 7 Up until existing agreements with Cadbury Schweppes expired in January 2003, at which point its distribution was expanded nationwide in the U.S. In 2004 the beverage had surpassed 7 Up on the basis of annual retail sales, placing it as the 2nd most-purchased lemon-lime soft drink in the U.S. (Sprite being the 1st).\n\nIn 2005, Diet Sierra Mist was renamed \"Sierra Mist Free\", intended as a descriptor of the beverage being \"free of\" sugar, calories, carbohydrates and caffeine. This name change was reverted to the original name, \"Diet Sierra Mist\", in November 2008. In late 2006, PepsiCo introduced \"Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash\". It was available only during the Winter holiday season. Cranberry Splash returned in the fall and winter of 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 along with Diet Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash. In May 2007, \"Sierra Mist Lemon Squeeze\" was introduced. This limited edition featured a higher concentration of lemon flavor and was only available through September 2007.\n\nSierra Mist can and bottle labels were redesigned as a part of PepsiCo's broader redesign of its core carbonated soft drink brands in 2008, with Sierra Mist Free reverting to the \"Diet Sierra Mist\" name in the process. The Sierra Mist logo was later redesigned again in March 2010 with a typeface similar to that of the current Pepsi design.\nSierra Mist underwent a more significant rebranding in August 2010, in response to shifting consumer preferences towards products made with \"natural\" ingredients – according to beverage industry and general news media reporting at the time. On August 29, 2010, Sierra Mist was replaced with Sierra Mist Natural, although the original Sierra Mist still remained stocked in markets until late 2010. Updated logos, bottle labeling and can designs were also implemented at the same time. At this time, the Sierra Mist drink was reformulated, sweetened with sucrose instead of high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nIn Fall 2014, Stevia was added as an adjunctive sweetener.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Pepsi announced that the name of Sierra Mist would be changing to Mist Twst at an unknown point in spring 2016, in line with Pepsico's sponsorship agreement with the NBA, which replaced Coca-Cola's previous sponsorship and its broad campaign with the league for Sprite. The name change was officially made in late March 2016.\n\nIn Summer 2018, the Mist Twst brand reverted to Sierra Mist.\n\nFrom 2000 until 2010 Sierra Mist was sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, and its other ingredients were listed as carbonated water, citric acid, natural flavors, potassium benzoate, potassium citrate, ascorbic acid and calcium disodium EDTA. Diet Sierra Mist is sweetened with aspartame and acesulfame potassium.\n\nIn August 2010 PepsiCo replaced the original Sierra Mist formula with \"Sierra Mist Natural\", which is sweetened with sucrose (table sugar) instead of high fructose corn syrup. The new formulation contains four other ingredients: carbonated water, citric acid, natural flavor, potassium citrate, and a preservative.\n\nBy 2013, Sierra Mist Natural reverted in name to simply Sierra Mist, and in 2014 the formulation was changed to use a combination of sucrose and stevia as sweeteners, in an effort to cut calories in drinks. The change proved unpopular, with complaints of the stevia introducing an unpleasant aftertaste.\n\nIn December 2015, PepsiCo announced that they were changing the name of Sierra Mist to \"Mist Twst\" in Spring 2016. The change occurred in some areas in March 2016. The new Mist Twst has added high-fructose corn syrup back to the formula.\n\nIn July 2018, Sierra Mist returned to its natural formula from 2010, made with real sugar and no stevia.\n\nIn 2005, a series of improv-based Sierra Mist commercials titled \"Mist Takes\" began airing. The commercials featured comedians Nicole Sullivan, Debra Wilson, Aries Spears, Jim Gaffigan and Michael Ian Black. In 2006, Kathy Griffin, Tracy Morgan and Guillermo Diaz joined the cast. Diaz and other members of the cast of \"Otro Rollo\" starred in the Spanish-language versions of the commercials. In 2007, Nicole Randall Johnson and Eliza Coupe joined the cast, replacing Debra Wilson and Kathy Griffin.\n\nIn December 2007, PepsiCo trademarked the names \"Sierra Mist: Undercover Orange\" and \"Sierra Mist Free: Undercover Orange\". The two sodas launched under a limited-time release in the summer of 2008 (with the faces of Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway on their labels), serving as a marketing tie-in with the release of the Warner Bros. film \"Get Smart\" on June 20, 2008. Sierra Mist: Undercover Orange and Sierra Mist Free: Undercover Orange were both clear sodas, like regular and Diet Sierra Mist, but had a mandarin orange flavor.\n\nSierra Mist was an official partner and sponsor of Major League Soccer and two franchises within the league, the New England Revolution and D.C. United. The league deal ended in 2015 when Coca-Cola announced a partnership with MLS and the US Soccer Federation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1646504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1646504", "title": "Countersink", "text": "Countersink\n\nA Countersink (symbol: ⌵) is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object, or the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a countersunk bolt, screw or rivet, when placed in the hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material (by comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a socket-head capscrew). A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation thereby improving the finish of the product and removing any hazardous sharp edges.\n\nThe basic geometry of a countersink (cutter) inherently can be applied to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering endmills (endmills with angled tips). Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).\n\nA countersink may be used in many tools, such as drills, drill presses, milling machines, and lathes.\n\nA Dan Martin Style \"zero flute\" countersink is a cone-shaped tool with a cutting edge provided by a hole that goes through the side of the cone. The intersection of the hole and cone form the cutting edge on the tool. The cone is not truly symmetrical as it is essential that the cone retreats away from the cutting edge as the tool rotates providing clearance. If this does not occur the cutting edge will lack clearance and rub rather than \"bite\" into the material. This clearance is referred to as cutting relief.\n\nThese tools are best used as deburring tools, where the burr from a previous machining operation needs to be removed for cosmetic and safety reasons, however they may be used in softer materials (such as wood or plastic) to create a countersunk hole for a screw.\n\nThe fluted countersink cutter is used to provide a heavy chamfer in the entrance to a drilled hole. This may be required to allow the correct seating for a countersunk-head screw or to provide the lead in for a second machining operation such as tapping. Countersink cutters are manufactured with six common angles, which are 60°, 82°, 90°, 100°, 110°, or 120°, with the two most common of those being 82° and 90°. Countersunk-head screws that follow the Unified Thread Standard very often have an 82° angle, and screws that follow the ISO standard very often have a 90° angle. Throughout the aerospace industry, countersunk fasteners typically have an angle of 100°.\n\nA \"back countersink\", also known as an \"inserted countersink\", is a two piece countersink used on tough to reach areas. One component is a rod that is inserted into the existing hole in the workpieces; the other component is the cutter, which is attached to the rod, or extends out of it, after it is in position. This is comparable to other types of \"back-\" machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations on the far side of the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a \"second operation\" setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via painstaking indicating).\n\nIt can often be difficult to avoid chatter (also known as machining vibrations) when cutting with countersink cutters. As usual in machining, the shorter and more rigid the setup, the better. Better-quality fluted countersink cutters sometimes have the flutes (or at least one flute) at an irregular pitching. This variation in pitching reduces the chance of the cutting edges setting up a harmonic action and leaving an undulated surface. This surface ripple is also dependent on the surface speed of the cutting edges, material type, and applied pressure (or feed rate); once started it is hard to remove. Too light a feed tends to increase chatter risk. As in many other machining operations, an appropriate response to the chatter may be to decrease speed and increase feed. On a drill press, the slowest available spindle speed is usually best. With a variable-speed handheld power drill, the trigger is best squeezed lightly to yield a low spindle speed.\n\nGood chatter-free results can usually be had by countersinking by hand (as opposed to running the tool in a powered spindle). The slow speed and sensitive feed tend to prevent chatter. With a quarter-inch-hex shank, the countersink cutter can be held with a screwdriver handle of the indexable - bit type.\n\nForm countersinking, also known as \"dimpling\", is a countersink that is formed into sheet metal to increase the strength of a structure as the countersinks of multiple pieces nest together. There are two processes for producing formed countersinks: \"coin dimpling\" and \"modified radius dimpling\". Such dimples in fairly thick sheet can even be tapped to yield a threaded hardpoint on the sheet without the bother and expense of welding a nut to the sheet. This style of construction is often seen in modern household appliance design, because it allows the product to be lower-priced, and the quality can still be good as long as the sheet is thick enough.\n\n"}

{"id": "1650551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1650551", "title": "Dubuque Packing Company", "text": "Dubuque Packing Company\n\nThe Dubuque Packing Company was a former meat packing company that operated under a variety of names in Dubuque, Iowa from 1891 until 2001. It was recognized for the quality of its products, and in the 1950s it became one of the largest employers in the city. The company was widely known in the community as \"The Pack.\" The company had the fleur-de-lis as its logo and trademark.\n\nIn June 1891 the Dubuque Packing Company was founded by the merger of the Dubuque Packing & Provision Company and the Dubuque Butchers Association. For the next forty years, the company acted as a local meat supplier. In 1931 Harry Wahlert purchased the plant for $80,000. At the time of Wahlert's purchase, the company employed only sixty people. Even though America was in the middle of the Great Depression, the company flourished under Wahlert's leadership.\n\nFollowing World War II, the company became the first company to export food to Italy when it exported canned hams to Italy. In the 1950s the company was the largest employer in Dubuque in front of the John Deere Dubuque Works manufacturing plant because the Dubuque Packing House is located within the city while the Deere works is not. During the 1960s, under the leadership of Robert C. Wahlert, the plant employed about 3,500 people, with a payroll of about $20 million. In 1948, ten employees of the Dubuque Packing Company pooled $5 each, in combination with a loan for $123.20 from the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Local Number 150, to charter Dupaco Credit Union, which eventually became Dupaco Community Credit Union.\n\nLabor union negotiations with the company made workers at the plant amongst one of the highest paid employers in the city. Dun's Review listed the company as the 15th largest privately held company in the United States in 1978, with sales of about $390 million. At its peak, the company's sales approached $2 billion and it had 12 plants. It was the 3rd largest beef slaughter in the U.S.\n\nThe company was also recognized for the quality of the products they made. In 1960 and 1961 the company won gold medals at the California state fairs for their canned hams. They also became one of the largest suppliers of kosher meat in the United States.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Dubuque plant began to decline. In 1980 the Dubuque Packing Company announced that they lost $9.9 million at its Dubuque facility. They asked the union for concessions, based on claims of market changes, high wages, and equipment problems. The company also shut down parts of the plant. By 1981 nearly 1,400 were unemployed when the hog kill was shut down. Then in 1982 company management announced that the plant would close on October 16, 1982, which would put 1,200 people out of work and bring the unemployment rate up to 17.2 percent. This was despite a 15.8 percent cut in pay and benefits that union workers had taken, and a reduction in taxes by the city.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, the President and Chairman of Dubuque Packing Company Charles E. Stoltz sold the packing plant and its \"fleur-de-lis\" trademark to a group which included Robert H. Wahlert. The packing plant began operations as FDL Foods, Inc. The Dubuque Packing Company moved its headquarters to the Dubuque Building, where it continued to bargain with the union over pension and insurance benefits. In 1985 the headquarters was moved to Omaha, Nebraska to be more centrally located to its other plants, which were processing primarily beef at that time. The company again flourished and was later sold in a leverage buyout to BeefAmerica, a firm controlled by Eli Jacobs. Its gelatin operations were sold to the French company Sanofi. BeefAmerica went out of business in 1998 following a recall and a strike.\n\nThe packing plant in Dubuque operated under the FDL Foods Inc. name until September 1995 when the plant again closed, this time due to the loss of the sole contract with Hormel (as reported to workers by management in July 1995). The plant was eventually sold to Farmland Foods, who continued to operate the plant until 2001. Smithfield Foods purchased the plant with the stated intention of refurbishing and reopening the plant. However once Smithfield purchased the plant they decided not to proceed with either remodeling or reopening the plant. This led to the belief that Smithfield only purchased the plant to remove competition from the market.\n\nFor the next four years, the former Dubuque Packing Company plant sat empty. From time to time Dubuque police used the plant for training purposes, but otherwise no activity took place there. Many in the community felt that the abandoned plant was an eyesore - especially given its position near the Mississippi River and U.S. Highway 61 & U.S. Highway 151. In 2003, Wal-Mart expressed interest in the site for a second supercenter. But when the city decided against supplying tax incentives, Wal-Mart decided not to proceed with the project.\n\nThen in 2004 local developer Wayne Briggs announced his plans to tear down the plant and redevelop the site as a shopping center. This new shopping center would have national retailers, and would give the northeastern parts of the city more shopping options. Briggs purchased the plant site. The Dubuque County zoning board gave their approval to the plans. On March 21, 2005 the entire city council approved the rezoning of the site.\n\nDemolition of the old packing plant was slow going due to concerns over hazardous waste such as asbestos. The asbestos was gone by May 2006, when a fire began at the former packing plant. The Dubuque Fire Department handled the fire, taking it slowly because of the instability of the partially demolished building. Briggs said at the time that the fire wouldn't affect the demolition schedule, and by October 1, 2006, the buildings were totally demolished. Currently site preparation is being done to prepare the site for construction.\n"}

It is a flat and round loaf, usually about in diameter and deep, with an indent in the middle produced by the baker. Elsewhere in the world, bread considered similar to the stottie is known as 'oven bottom bread', though this term is a relative newcomer, given that, prior to the widespread use of cast iron ovens with shelves, ovens were built of brick and only had the bottom available to bake on. One chief characteristic is the heavy and dough-like texture of the bread. Though leavened, its taste and mouth-feel is heavy and very reminiscent of dough. It is heavy and dense because it was only been allowed to prove once rather than the usual twice. This indicates that its origins lie in the breads used to 'test' ovens, and that is may be related to similar breads baked elsewhere in Europe for the same reason. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that some stotties were made with the offcuts of dough when all of the required loaves had been baked. \n\nStotties tend to be eaten split and filled. Common fillings include ham and pease pudding, but also bacon, egg and sausage. The heavy texture of the bread gives it its name. To \"stott\" means \"to bounce\" in Northumbrian, because if dropped it would (in theory) bounce (this could also refer to the fact that it was merely thrown upon the oven floor). Stotting is also used by biologists to describe the jumping behaviour of antelopes in response to predators.\n\nThough originating in the North East, stotties can be found in most parts of Britain, although rarely in the south, and have been offered for sale in branches of Greggs, Morrisons and Waitrose. Stotties sold by supermarkets tend to resemble stotties only in shape; the bread is lighter and more crumbly, resembling a bread roll more faithfully than a baker's stottie.\n\n\n"}

It is served on a hot dog bun with various toppings. Also known as a bacon-wrapped hot dog, it was first sold by street vendors in Mexico. Its origin has been placed in either Tijuana or Hermosillo, where it was originally served in a bolillo instead of a hot dog bun.\n\nDanger dogs are now sold by street vendors and in restaurants in urban areas in the United States such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City.\n\nThe term \"danger dog\" originates from this form of hot dog's reputation as being of cheap quality, as it is often sold by unlicensed street vendors.\n\nIn Chicago there is a variation of the danger dog called the francheezie. This is an all-beef hot dog wrapped in bacon and deep fried, with melted Cheddar or American cheese (or Velveeta). Usually the hot dog is split and filled with cheese before being deep fried. Alternatively the cheese may be added as a topping after frying. The francheezie is served on a poppy seed bun, either \"plain\" or with the toppings of a Chicago-style hot dog. It is typically sold by restaurants rather than by street vendors.\nIn Los Angeles the danger dog is known as the bacon-wrapped hot dog. Vendors can be found cooking them on a stainless steel baking tray over Sterno heat sources outside of bars, concerts, sporting events, and other late night establishments. The bacon-wrapped usually consists of a bacon-wrapped hot dog, grilled onions and bell peppers, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and grilled jalapeño peppers. After a public campaign in 2010, the L.A. City Council proclaimed the bacon-wrapped to be the official hot dog of Los Angeles.\nIn New Jersey and elsewhere on the East Coast, there is a variation called the Jersey breakfast dog.

{"id": "1653379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1653379", "title": "Tropicana Products", "text": "Tropicana Products\n\nTropicana Products, Inc. is an American multinational company which primarily makes fruit-based beverages. It was founded in 1947 by Anthony T. Rossi in Bradenton, Florida. Since 1998, it has been owned by PepsiCo. Tropicana's headquarters are in Chicago. The company specializes in the production of orange juice.\n\nAnthony T. Rossi (1900–1993) was born in Italy on the island of Sicily. He had the equivalent of a high school education and immigrated to the United States when he was 21 years old. He drove a taxi, was a grocer in New York, farmed in Virginia, and then moved to Florida in 1940 where he farmed and was a restaurateur. His first involvement with the Florida citrus industry was fresh fruit gift boxes sold by Macy's and Gimbels department stores in New York City, New York.\n\nIn 1947, Rossi settled in Palmetto, Florida and began packing fruit gift boxes and jars of sectioned fruit for salads under the name Manatee River Packing Company. As the fruit segment business grew, the company moved to a larger location in east Bradenton, Florida and changed its name to Fruit Industries. The ingredients for the fresh fruit salads on the menu of New York’s famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel were supplied by Fruit Industries. At the east Bradenton location, Rossi began producing frozen concentrate orange juice as a natural extension of the fruit section business.\n\nIn 1952, with growth of the orange juice business in mind, Rossi purchased the Grapefruit Canning Company in Bradenton. The fresh fruit segments and orange juice business were so successful that he discontinued production of fruit boxes. He developed flash pasteurization in 1954, a process that rapidly raised the temperature of juice for a short time to preserve its fresh taste. For the first time, consumers could have the fresh taste of pure not-from-concentrate juice in a ready to serve chilled package. The juice, Tropicana Pure Premium, became the company’s flagship product.\n\nThe company developed a trademarked cartoon mascot for the brand called Tropic-Ana, a barefoot young girl carrying oranges on her head and wearing clothing that resembles a Hawaiian grass skirt and lei. She appeared prominently on the juice cartons and even the train cars used to transport the juice. Her image was diminished and finally phased out during the 1980s.\n\nEd Price was hired as executive vice president and director in 1955 and represented the company as chairman of the Florida Citrus Commission.\nIn 1957, the company’s name was changed to Tropicana Products, Inc. to reflect the growing appeal of the Tropicana brand.\n\nTropicana purchased one million dollars worth of refrigerated trucks to deliver Pure Premium. Soon, 2,000 dairies delivered Pure Premium orange juice to the doorsteps of consumers each morning. By 1958, a ship, S.S. Tropicana, was taking of juice to New York each week from the new base at Cape Canaveral, Florida. From 1960 to 1970, Tropicana utilized TOFC (trailers on flatbed cars) to move the juice more efficiently.\n\nIn 1970, Tropicana orange juice was shipped as finished goods via refrigerated boxcars in one weekly round-trip from Florida to Kearny, New Jersey. By the following year, the company was operating two 65-car unit trains a week, each carrying around of juice. The \"Great White Juice Train\" (the first unit train in the food industry, consisting of 150 100-ton insulated boxcars fabricated in the Alexandria, Virginia shops of Fruit Growers Express) commenced service on June 7, 1971 over the route. An additional 100 cars were soon incorporated into the fleet, and small mechanical refrigeration units were installed to keep temperatures constant on hot days. In 2004, Tropicana’s rail fleet of 514 cars traveled over – a method that is three times more fuel efficient than other shipping methods.\n\nTropicana Products, Inc. went public in 1969. The stock was first sold over the counter, but gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TOJ. In the same year, it became the first company in the citrus industry to operate its own plastic container manufacturing plant.\n\nExecutive vice president Ed Price, who served two terms in the Florida Senate (1958–1966), resigned his position in 1972, but remained on the board of directors until 1983.\n\nRossi sold Tropicana to Beatrice Foods in 1978. He then retired, and was inducted into the \"Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame\" in 1987. Under Beatrice, Tropicana had the financial resources to develop more products. In 1985, Tropicana debuted Tropicana Pure Premium HomeStyle orange juice, which featured added pulp.\n\nIn the 1980s, Tropicana made history by being the first company to be acquired by The Seagram Company, Ltd.. In the decade that followed, they introduced new juice beverage creations, including the orange line of bottled and frozen juice blends.\n\nIn the early nineties under Seagram, Tropicana also began to expand distribution to global markets. They formed a partnership to process and distribute Kirin-Tropicana juices in Japan. By that time, the company was also distributing Tropicana Pure Premium in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Argentina, Panama and Sweden. As the 1990s continued, Tropicana further expanded internationally, entering several more Latin American countries, Hong Kong and China.\n\nSeagram Beverage Group acquired Dole Food Company's global juice business in 1995, including the Dole brands in North America, and Dole, Fruvita, Looza and Juice Bowl juices and nectars in Europe. Dole was operated under Tropicana Dole Beverages North America and Tropicana Dole Beverages International.\n\nTropicana was acquired by PepsiCo in 1998, which combined it with the Dole brand for marketing purposes. It has become the world’s leading producer of branded fruit juices. Tropicana headquarters moved to Chicago in 2003.\n\nDue to the decreased productivity of Florida's orange crop in the wake of several damaging frosts, Tropicana began using a blend of Florida and Brazilian oranges in 2007. Citing an increased consumer interest in the origin of food products, the company announced in February 2012 that its Tropicana Pure Premium line would return to sourcing oranges only from Florida. Tropicana later reverted to sourcing its oranges from both Florida and Brazil.\n\nIn February 2009, Tropicana switched the design on all cartons sold in the United States to a new image created by the Arnell Group. The new image showed the actual orange juice and redesigned the cap to look like the outside of an orange. After less than two months and a 20 percent drop in sales, Tropicana switched back to its original design of an orange skewered by a drinking straw.\n\nIn early 2010, Tropicana reduced the size of its traditional 64 oz carton to 59 oz in the U.S. market, and maintained the original price. This change represented a 7.8 percent price-per-ounce increase for consumers.\n\nIn 2018, Tropicana reduced the size again of its container from 59 oz to 52 oz.\n\nTropicana works with more than 12 established Florida groves, which are selected for sandy soil conditions and advanced irrigation practices. The company is the largest single buyer of Florida fruit and processes about 60 million boxes of fruit.\n\nThe oranges are then washed and the orange oil is extracted from the peel to capture the from-the-orange taste, which is later blended into the juice for consistent quality and flavor. The oranges are squeezed and the fresh juice is flash pasteurized. Tropicana developed flash pasteurization to minimize the time the orange juice is exposed to heat while providing maximum nutrition and flavor.\n\nOranges have a limited growing season, and because there is demand for juice year round, an unspecified quantity of juice (some or potentially all) is deaerated and then stored for future packaging in chilled tanks to preserve quality. The aseptic tanks protect the juice from oxygen and light and hold the liquid at optimal temperatures just above freezing to maintain maximum nutrition. It has been reported that deaerated juice no longer tastes like oranges, and must be supplemented before consumption with orange oils in order to recreate the organe flavour. Pulp may be blended in at this point, too, depending on the product.\n\nTropicana's carton and plastic packaging are engineered to maintain quality and freshness. The company's packaging materials ensure the juice stays fresh inside the package by preventing outside moisture and light from affecting its quality.\n\nIn 2008, Tropicana joined forces with charity Cool Earth and started the 'Rescue Rainforest' campaign in the U.S. People could buy special promotional packs of Tropicana and enter the pack's code online. For each code entered, of rainforest could be saved. The project is based in the Ashaninka corridor in Peru, which lies in an arc of deforestation. As of June 2009, over (2,734 square miles) had been saved.\n\nAlong with launching the Rescue Rainforest initiative, Tropicana has been trying to reduce their carbon footprint by encouraging carton recycling and supporting the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.\n\nPepsi produces fruit flavored soft drinks called Tropicana Twister Soda.\n\nThis soft drink line has largely replaced Pepsi's Slice soft drinks. Tropicana also has Fruit Snacks, and in the United Kingdom makes smoothies.\n\nTrop50, introduced by Tropicana in 2009, is orange juice with 50 percent less sugar and calories, and no artificial sweeteners (Note: Has Reb A or PureVia which is a form of the plant Stevia – but \"is\" chemically altered and changed.) Trop50 is available in several varieties including Farmstand Apple, Pomegranate Blueberry, Pineapple Mango, Orange, Lemonade and Raspberry Lemonade. \n\nA number of their juice products, designed for 'extended shelf life', are colored with the extract of cochineal beetles. As this previously embarrassed the company, they use 'Carmine' on the label which is an alternate name for the dye.\n\nIn March 2011, the IRI named Trop50 as one of the “Top 10 Food and Beverage Brands in 2010”\n\nIn 2010, the company announced the impending limited release of Tropolis, a liquid fruit snack drink, for January 2011.\n\nTropicana holds sponsorship to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, the home to the baseball team Tampa Bay Rays. The name of the Bradenton Juice baseball team of the South Coast League is loosely related to Tropicana.\n\nTropicana Products has its headquarters in Chicago. PepsiCo, the parent company of Tropicana, planned to begin moving Tropicana employees into its existing Chicago facility in the first quarter of 2004. PepsiCo moved Tropicana into Chicago so all of its juice brands would be consolidated into one Chicago-based unit.\n\nUntil 2004, Tropicana Products was headquartered in the four-story Rossi Office Building in Bradenton, Florida. The Class A office space building, which was completed in 2002, went on the real estate market for $20 million in 2004. In 2007, it was sold to Bealls of Florida. The building was renamed the E. R. Beall Center. The Beall Center, which cost $33 million to build, had an appraised value of $38 million in 2005. The former Tropicana building has a cafeteria, a fitness center, and a meeting space.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1655085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1655085", "title": "Viniyoga", "text": "Viniyoga\n\nViniyoga is the individualised style of modern yoga developed by Tirumalai Krishnamacharya and taught by his son T. K. V. Desikachar.\n\nViniyoga in Sanskrit originally meant \"employment\", \"use\", or \"application\". The root ' means \"to join\", among other senses, with two prefixes ' and ' it means the opposite — separation. In the book \"The Viniyoga of Yoga\" Desikachar wrote that the term Viniyoga was not initially intended to mean \"a style of yoga, but an approach to utilizing its tools\". Desikachar explained that 'Viniyoga' had wider usage. As a technical term in Hindu religious literature it means a short introductory section that gives standard details about the work, such as the sage (') said to have originated the work, the meter in which it is to be chanted, the deity (') considered to preside over it, and other technical details of its use.\n\nThe word also appears in the \"Yoga Sūtra of Patañjali\", where sūtra 3.6 says that the application of the practice of \"\" takes place in stages.\n\nIndian yoga teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya developed this individualized yoga style, which came to be described by others as Viniyoga, although he himself did not identify his approach by this name.\n\nThe term viniyoga came to be used by Western students of T.K.V. Desikachar (son of Krishnamacharya) to collectively describe his approach to utilizing the tools of yoga, in particular his conviction that yoga practice should be adapted to fit the individuality and particular situation of each practitioner.\n\nViniyoga was just as effective as conventional stretching exercise, and more effective than a self-care book for improving function and pain in patients with chronic low back pain. A 2011 study published online by the Archives of Internal Medicine found that viniyoga was more effective in reducing back pain than using a self-care book. However, viniyoga was no more effective in reducing back pain than stretching classes.\n\nT. K. V. Desikachar described viniyoga in May 1983 as the \"systematic application of Yoga\":\n\n\"“Yoga is a mystery. It does not mean the same thing to each and everyone. In spite of the vast field it covers curing chronic ailments, extra-sensory perception, etc, hardly anyone is able to define it in simple terms. Where is then the hope of experiencing its true significance?\"\n\n\"What about the risks of inappropriate use of Yoga methods and practices?\"\n\n\"Why are so many people all over the world taking the word and the substance of Yoga so lightly, so ridiculously? Like everything, Yoga must be presented intelligently. It should be spoken of carefully and offered according to the aspiration, requirement and the culture of the individual.This should be done in stages.Systematic application of Yoga – be it concerned with physical exercises, deep breathing, relaxation, meditation, lifestyle, food, studies – is the need of the day.\"\n\n\"This I believe – is what the word viniyoga represents\".” \n\nHowever from 2002 Desikachar began to disassociate himself from being linked to the singular word viniyoga and its use to commonly identify his teacher’s teaching. This was because of the shift in popular perception from his description of the viniyoga of Yoga as referring to the appropriate application of Yoga, now not just shortened to viniyoga as a generic collective, but also to Viniyoga as a marketable branding handle. His original intention was that it would collectively describe an intelligent and systematic approach to teaching Yoga, collating the teachings of T Krishnamacharya, within individual situations for a Yoga teacher trained by TKV Desikachar, or one of his students.\n\nFollowing on from this on April 24, 2003 there was a general email sent to his senior students around the world which asked them to choose either not to use the singular word ‘Viniyoga’ to represent Desikachar’s and Krishnamacharya’s approach to teaching Yoga or to remove their names from their communications.\n\nDear Friends,\n\nWhen I introduced the concept of viniyoga in the late 70’s and early 80’s, I never imagined that it will replace the word “Yoga”.\n\nI am extremely disappointed with the situation today, where this has become the case and caused so much distortion and confusion. Hence I request you to either delete the word Viniyoga to represent my teacher’s teaching, or remove my father’s and my name from your communications. This is the least you can do for me, as a guru dakshina.\n\nPlease feel free to forward this to other students whose email addresses I don’t have.\n\nWith Best Wishes\n\nTKV Desikachar\n\nIn 2015, the Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation registered Viniyoga as a trademark in India under class 44 (medical services). In 2017, it registered Viniyoga as a trademark in the European Union.\n\n"}

{"id": "1656748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1656748", "title": "Family medicine", "text": "Family medicine\n\nFamily medicine (FM), formerly family practice (FP), is a medical specialty devoted to comprehensive health care for people of all ages; the specialist is named a family physician or family doctor. In Europe the discipline is often referred to as general practice and a practitioner as a general practice doctor or GP; this name emphasises the holistic nature of this speciality, as well as its roots in the family. Family practice is a division of primary care that provides continuing and comprehensive health care for the individual and family across all ages, genders, diseases, and parts of the body; family physicians are often primary care physicians. It is based on knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community, emphasizing disease prevention and health promotion. According to the World Organization of Family Doctors (WONCA), the aim of family medicine is to provide personal, comprehensive, and continuing care for the individual in the context of the family and the community. The issues of values underlying this practice are usually known as primary care ethics.\n\nFamily physicians in the United States may hold either a M.D. or a D.O. degree. Physicians who specialize in family medicine must successfully complete an accredited three- or four-year family medicine residency in the United States in addition to their medical degree. They are then eligible to sit for a board certification examination, which is now required by most hospitals and health plans. American Board of Family Medicine requires its Diplomates to maintain certification through an ongoing process of continuing medical education, medical knowledge review, patient care oversight through chart audits, practice-based learning through quality improvement projects and retaking the board certification examination every 7 to 10 years. The American Osteopathic Board of Family Physicians requires its Diplomates to maintain certification and undergo the process of recertification every 8 years.\n\nPhysicians certified in family medicine in Canada are certified through the College of Family Physicians of Canada, after two years of additional education. Continuing education is also a requirement for continued certification.\n\nThe term \"family medicine\" is used in many European and Asian countries, instead of \"general medicine\" or \"general practice\". In Sweden, certification in family medicine requires five years working with a tutor, after the medical degree. In India, those who want to specialize in family medicine must complete a three-year family medicine residency, after their medical degree (MBBS). They are awarded either a D.N.B. or an M.D. in family medicine. Similar systems exist in other countries.\n\nFamily physicians deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive medical care services. In addition to diagnosing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups, health-risk assessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized counseling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Family physicians also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by other subspecialists. Many American Family Physicians deliver babies and provide prenatal care. In the U.S., family physicians treat more patients with back pain than any other physician subspecialist, and about as many as orthopedists and neurosurgeons combined.\n\nFamily medicine and family physicians play a very important role in the healthcare system of a country. In the U.S., for example, nearly one in four of all office visits are made to family physicians. That is 208 million office visits each year — nearly 83 million more than the next largest medical specialty. Today, family physicians provide more care for America’s underserved and rural populations than any other medical specialty.\n\nIn Canada, aspiring family physicians are expected to complete a residency in family medicine from an accredited university after obtaining their M.D. degree. Although the residency usually has a duration of two years, graduates may apply to complete a third year, leading to a certification from the College of Family Physicians Canada in disciplines such as emergency medicine, palliative care, and women's health, amongst many others. In some institutions, such as McGill University in Montreal, graduates from family medicine residency programs are eligible to complete a master's degree and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Family Medicine, which predominantly consists of a research-oriented program.\n\nConcern for family health and medicine in the United States existed as far back as the early 1930s and 40s. The American public health advocate Bailey Barton Burritt was labeled \"the father of the family health movement\" by \"The New York Times\" in 1944.\n\nFollowing World War II, two main concerns shaped the advent of family medicine. First, medical specialties and subspecialties increased in popularity, having an adverse effect on the number of physicians in general practice. At the same time, many medical advances were being made and there was concern within the \"general practitioner\" or \"GP\" population that four years of medical school plus a one-year internship was no longer adequate preparation for the breadth of medical knowledge required of the profession. Many of these doctors wanted to see a residency program added to their training; this would not only give them additional training, knowledge, and prestige, but would allow for board certification, which was increasingly required to gain hospital privileges. In February 1969, family medicine (then known as family practice) was recognized as a distinct specialty in the U.S. It was the twentieth specialty to be recognized.\n\nFamily physicians complete an undergraduate degree, medical school, and three more years of specialized medical residency training in family medicine. Their residency training includes rotations in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, surgery, emergency medicine, and geriatrics. Residents also must provide care for a panel of continuity patients in an outpatient \"model practice\" for the entire period of residency. The specialty focuses on treating the whole person, acknowledging the effects of all outside influences, through all stages of life. Family physicians will see anyone with any problem, but are experts in common problems. Many family physicians deliver babies in addition to taking care of patients of all ages.\n\nIn order to become board certified, family physicians must complete a residency in family medicine, possess a full and unrestricted medical license, and take a written cognitive examination. Between 2003 and 2009, the process for maintenance of board certification in family medicine is being changed (as well as all other American Specialty Boards) to a series of yearly tests on differing areas. The American Board of Family Medicine, as well as other specialty boards, are requiring additional participation in continuous learning and self-assessment to enhance clinical knowledge, expertise and skills. The Board has created a program called the \"Maintenance of Certification Program for Family Physicians\" (MC-FP) which will require family physicians to continuously demonstrate proficiency in four areas of clinical practice: professionalism, self-assessment/lifelong learning, cognitive expertise, and performance in practice. Three hundred hours of continuing medical education within the prior six years is also required to be eligible to sit for the exam.\n\nFamily physicians may pursue fellowships in several fields, including adolescent medicine, geriatric medicine, sports medicine, sleep medicine, hospital medicine and hospice and palliative medicine. The American Board of Family Medicine and the American Osteopathic Board of Family Medicine both offer Certificates of Added Qualifications (CAQs) in each of these topics.\n\nWhile many sources cite a shortage of family physicians (and also other primary care providers, i.e. internists, pediatricians, and general practitioners), the per capita supply of primary care physicians has actually increased about 1 percent per year since 1998. Additionally, a recent decrease in the number of M.D. graduates pursuing a residency in primary care has been offset by the number of D.O. graduates and graduates of international medical schools (IMGs) who enter primary care residencies. Still, projections indicate that by 2020 the demand for family physicians will exceed their supply.\n\nThe number of students entering family medicine residency training has fallen from a high of 3,293 in 1998 to 1,172 in 2008, according to National Residency Matching Program data. Fifty-five family medicine residency programs have closed since 2000, while only 28 programs have opened.\n\nIn 2006, when the nation had 100,431 family physicians, a workforce report by the American Academy of Family Physicians indicated the United States would need 139,531 family physicians by 2020 to meet the need for primary medical care. To reach that figure 4,439 family physicians must complete their residencies each year, but currently the nation is attracting only half the number of future family physicians that will be needed.\n\nThe waning interest in family medicine in the U.S. is likely due to several factors, including the lesser prestige associated with the specialty, the lesser pay, and the increasingly frustrating practice environment. Salaries for family physicians in the United States are respectable, but lower than average for physicians, with the average being $225,000. However, when faced with debt from medical school, most medical students are opting for the higher paying specialties. Potential ways to increase the number of medical students entering family practice include providing relief from medical education debt through loan-repayment programs and restructuring fee-for-service reimbursement for health care services. Family physicians are trained to manage acute and chronic health issues for an individual simultaneously, yet their appointment slots may average only ten minutes.\n\nMost family physicians in the US practice in solo or small-group private practices or as hospital employees in practices of similar sizes owned by hospitals. However, the specialty is broad and allows for a variety of career options including education, emergency medicine or urgent care, inpatient medicine, international or wilderness medicine, public health, sports medicine, and research. Others choose to practice as consultants to various medical institutions, including insurance companies.\n\nFamily Medicine (FM) came to be recognized as a medical specialty in India only in the late 1990s. According to the National Health Policy - 2002, there is an acute shortage of specialists in family medicine. As family physicians play very important role in providing affordable and universal health care to people, the Government of India is now promoting the practice of family medicine by introducing post graduate training through DNB (Diplomate National Board) programs.\n\nThere is a severe shortage of post graduate training seats, causing lot of struggle, hardship and a career bottle neck for newly qualified doctors, just passing out of medical school. The Family Medicine Training seats should ideally fill this gap and allow more doctors to pursue Family Medicine careers. However, the uptake, awareness and development of this specialty is slow.\n\nAlthough family medicine is sometimes called general practice, they are not identical in India. A medical graduate who has successfully completed the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) course and has been registered with Indian Medical Council or any state medical council is considered a general practitioner. A family physician, however, is a primary care physician who has completed specialist training in the discipline of family medicine.\n\nThe Medical Council of India requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, leading to the award of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in Family Medicine or Diplomate of National Board (DNB) in Family Medicine.\n\nThe National Board of Examinations conducts family medicine residency programmes at the teaching hospitals that it accredits. On successful completion of a three-year residency, candidates are awarded Diplomate of National Board (Family Medicine). The curriculum of DNB (FM) comprises: (1) medicine and allied sciences; (2) surgery and allied sciences; (3) maternal and child health; (4) basic sciences and community health. During their three-year residency, candidates receive integrated inpatient and outpatient learning. They also receive field training at community health centres and clinics.\n\nThe Medical Council of India permits accredited medical colleges (medical schools) to conduct a similar residency programme in family medicine. On successful completion of three-year residency, candidates are awarded Doctor of Medicine (Family Medicine). Govt. medical college, Calicut had started this MD (FM) course in 2011. A few of the AIIMS institutes have also started a course called MD in community and family medicine in recent years. Even though there is an acute shortage of qualified family physicians in India, further progress has been slow.\n\nThe Indian Medical Association’s College of General Practitioners, offers a one-year Diploma in Family Medicine (DFM), a distance education programme of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka, for doctors with minimum five years of experience in general practice. Since the Medical Council of India requires three-year residency for family medicine specialty, these diplomas are not recognized qualifications in India.\n\nAs India’s need for primary and secondary levels of health care is enormous, medical educators have called for systemic changes to include family medicine in the undergraduate medical curriculum.\n\nRecently, the residency-trained family physicians have formed the Academy of Family Physicians of India (AFPI). AFPI is the academic association of family physicians with formal full-time residency training (DNB Family Medicine) in Family Medicine. Currently there are about two hundred family medicine residency training sites accredited by the National Board of Examination India, providing around 700 training posts annually. However, there are various issues like academic acceptance, accreditation, curriculum development, uniform training standards, faculty development, research in primary care, \"etc.\" in need of urgent attention for family medicine to flourish as an academic specialty in India. The government of India has declared Family Medicine as focus area of human resource development in health sector in the National Health Policy 2002 There is discussion ongoing to employ multi-skilled doctors with DNB family medicine qualification against specialist posts in NRHM (National Rural Health Mission).\n\nThree possible models of how family physicians will practise their specialty in India might evolve, namely (1) private practice, (2) practising at primary care clinics/hospitals, (3) practising as consultants at secondary/tertiary care hospitals.\n\nFamily medicine was first recognized as specialty in 2015 and currently has approximately 500 certified family doctors. The Japanese government has made a commitment to increase the number of family doctors in an effort to improve the cost-effectiveness and quality of primary care in light of increasing health care costs. The Japan Primary Care Association (JPCA) is currently the largest academic association of family doctors in Japan. The JPCA family medicine training scheme consists of a three-year programme following the two-year internship. The Japanese Medical Specialty Board define the standard of the specialty training programme for board-certified family doctors. Japan has a free access healthcare system meaning patients can bypass primary care services. In addition to family medicine specialists Japan also has ~100,000 organ-specialist primary care clinics. The doctors working in these clinics do not typically have formal training in family medicine. In 2012 the mean consultation length in a family medicine clinic was 10.2 minutes.\n"}

It is part of traditional culture in Québec, Eastern Ontario, New Brunswick and northern New England. In these regions, it is poured onto the snow, then lifted either with a small wooden stick, such as a popsicle stick, or a metal dinner fork.\n\nThe candy is made by boiling maple syrup to about 112 °C (234 °F). It is best to use a candy thermometer. The thick liquid may be kept hot over a very low flame or in a pan of hot water, but should not be stirred as it will form grainy crystals. This liquid is then poured in a molten state upon clean snow, whereupon the cold causes it to rapidly thicken. If the syrup runs, rather than hardens, when it is poured on the snow, then it has not yet been boiled long enough to make the soft maple candy. Once sufficiently hardened, the candy can be picked up and eaten. The higher a temperature one boils the initial syrup, the thicker the final result will be. As it is popularly eaten soft, it is usually served fresh. It is most often prepared and eaten alongside the making of maple syrup at a sugar house, or cabane à sucre.\n\nThe practice in Quebec is conducted in a \"cabane à sucre\" (literally, \"sugar cabin,\" the rustic, outdoor structure where maple sap is boiled down to syrup and sugar) and the taffy is served with traditional Québécois dishes, including many savory ones that feature maple sugar as a glaze or flavoring element. In New England, the practice is called a \"sugar on snow party,\" and the soft candy is traditionally served with donuts, sour dill pickles, and coffee. The pickles and coffee serve to counter the intense sweetness of the candy. \n\nMaple taffy is also made in the Canadian province of Manitoba using syrup from the Manitoba maple tree (also known as a box elder). The syrup and taffy produced from a Manitoba maple are generally darker and have a mustier flavour than that made from sugar maples.\n\n\n"}

In 1963, SweeTarts were introduced with the same flavors as the popular Pixy Stix: cherry, grape, lemon, lime, and orange.\n\nSunline, Inc., became the Sunmark Companies and was later bought by Rowntree Mackintosh, of the United Kingdom, which was, in turn, taken over by Nestlé. Nestlé rolled the SweeTarts family of candies into the already-existing Willy Wonka Candy Company family of brands.\n\nSweeTarts also come in a variety of other products including gum, little SweeTarts (often packaged to be handed out as Halloween trick-or-treat candy), SweeTart \"hearts\" for Valentine's Day, \"chicks and bunnies\" shaped SweeTarts and SweeTarts Jelly Beans (marketed for Easter in some regions of the US), \"skulls and bones\" for Halloween, and Giant Chewy SweeTarts, which are a larger, chewier variant of SweeTarts that come four to a package, and are the size of a silver dollar and ¼ inch thick.

{"id": "1660428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1660428", "title": "Pupusa", "text": "Pupusa\n\nPupusa is thick cornmeal flatbread from the Pipil culture of El Salvador. It is stuffed with one or more of the following ingredients: cheese (usually a viscous cheese called \"quesillo\" that is very common in certain countries), \"chicharrón\" (pork rinds), squash, refried beans, or cheese with \"loroco\". It can also be made with a mix of ingredients such as cheese, beans, and chicharrón. It is typically accompanied by \"curtido\" (a spicy cabbage slaw), and tomato salsa, and is traditionally eaten by hand, without the use of utensils.\n\nThe preparation process of this dish consists of many diverse steps, and the use of a variety of ingredients, those of which also constitute economic support for the productors. Pupusas also display a similitude to Venezuelan arepas.\n\nThe pupusa is the most common staple food of El Salvador, most likely because it is a traditional dish that has been passed down from generation to generation. Although the specific origin of pupusas is unknown, anthropological studies show that was started in Central American territories, most especially in the western part of El Salvador. Although there are existing controversies that have taken on an international character about the origin and right of the traditional dish, these controversies have not triggered any significant consequences.\n\n\"Pupusa\" may be a Spanish rendering of \"popotlax\", which is a combination of the Pipil or Nahuatl words \"popotl\" meaning large, stuffed, bulky, and \"tlaxkalli\" which means tortilla. It may also come from the Pipil language.\n\nPupusas were first created centuries ago by the Pipil tribes who inhabited the territory now known as El Salvador. Cooking implements for their preparation have been excavated in Joya de Cerén, \"El Salvador's Pompeii\", site of a native village that was buried by ashes from a volcano eruption, and where foodstuffs were preserved as they were being cooked almost 2000 years ago. The instruments for their preparation have also been found in other archaeological sites in El Salvador.\n\nThe pre-Columbian pupusa were vegetarian and half-moon shaped. They were filled with squash flowers and buds, herbs such as chipilin and mora, fungi and salt. By 1570 meat had been incorporated into the filling, as noted by Franciscan friar Bernardino De Sahagun.\n\nIn the late 1940s, pupusas were still not widespread across El Salvador, and were mostly localized in the central towns, such as Quezaltepeque, and cities of the country. As the population began migrating to other areas in the 1960s, pupusa stands proliferated across the country and in neighboring areas of Honduras and Guatemala, sometimes with variations in shape, size or filling. In Guatemala during the 1970s, pupusas had a half-moon shape. The half-moon shape would be considered a half-eaten pupusa in the Chalatenango area; fish pupusas were uncommon, and pupusas served east of the Lempa River usually had a much larger diameter.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Salvadoran civil war forced a Salvadoran migration to other countries, mainly the United States. Therefore, pupusas became available outside the country wherever a Salvadoran community was found. Immigrants have brought the dish to most areas of the United States. \"Pupuserías\" also may be found in many areas of Canada. In recent years, pupusas can even be found in some Latin American restaurants in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia.\n\nOn 1 April 2005, the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly declared pupusas as the national dish of El Salvador and every second Sunday of November would be National Pupusas Day. A fair is typically held on the day in the capital and a few big cities. On 10 November 2007, in celebration of National Pupusa Day, the Secretary of Culture organized a fair in the capital park in which they would make the world's biggest pupusa. The pupusa was 3.15 meters in diameter and was made with 200 lb. of masa, 40 lb. of cheese, and 40 lb. of chicharrón. It fed 5,000 people. Five years later, the record was broken again with a pupusa 4.25 meters in diameter. Guinness World Records lists the largest pupusa at 4.5 metres, created in Olocuilta, El Salvador on November 8, 2015.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Guardian\" named pupusas that year’s Best Street Food in New York.\n\nBoth at home and abroad, pupusas are traditionally served with \"curtido\" (a pickled cabbage relish, analogous to German \"Sauerkraut\" and Korean \"kimchi\" that comes in mild and spicy varieties) and tomato sauce, and are traditionally eaten by hand.\n\nEach pupusa is made up of two spoonfuls of masa, or dough, and one spoonful of filling. They can be formed in two ways:\n\n\nIn both methods, one should take special care that the pupusa is a circular shape, that the filling is well distributed, that the layer of masa isn't too thick, and that there aren't any holes through which the filling could spill out.\n\nEl Salvador and Honduras both claim to be the birthplace of the pupusa. Salvadoran archeologist Roberto Ordóñez attributed the creation of the pupusa to the Pipil people due to the name meaning ('swollen') in the Pipil language, and the artifacts found in the Joya de Ceren which show ingredients and tools that were used to make an early version of pupusas. Honduran etymologists say that since the Pipil language is so close to the Nahuatl language, the Honduran Nahua tribe could have created the dish. The topic of the pupusa’s origin also came up during the negotiation for the CAFTA-DR. Both nations wanted to make the pupusa an exclusive export. After two days the Honduran delegation ceded the right to El Salvador.\n\nA variant of the pupusa in El Salvador is the \"pupusa de arroz\". Rice flour is used to make the dough and they are usually stuffed with chopped pork, cheese, beans, zucchini, and other vegetables. They hail from the town of Olocuilta, located to the east of San Salvador, but are now readily available throughout the country. Another regional variation, found in Alegría, is the \"pupusa de banano\", which calls for the addition of plantain bananas to the pupusa.\nPupusas are also found in neighboring Central American countries. Honduran versions use the local \"quesillo\" type of cheese for the filling. In Costa Rica, both \"Salvadoran pupusas\" and \"pupusas\" are available, the latter being a local version. There, they are a staple of the food stalls at regional carnivals known as fiestas.\n\nA similar Mexican dish is called a \"gordita\" (literally, \"little fatty\"), but \"gorditas\" are usually open at one end. In Venezuela, they make \"arepas\" (where the dough is cooked first, and then sliced in half and stuffed somewhat like a hamburger). Colombia has its own recipe of \"arepas\", but, unlike Venezuelan, Colombian \"arepas\" are usually eaten without filling, or the filling is placed inside the dough before cooking.\n\nPupusas made in the United States are typically made with Maseca (brand) commercial corn flour-masa mix , instead of fresh \"masa harina\". Some high-end \"pupuserías\" in the United States use rice flour and wheat flour versions. In Santa Fe, New Mexico, variations include using spinach, pepperoni, cheese, and green chile.\n\nTaco Cabana, a Tex-Mex chain in Texas, created a dish called the pupusa that has no relation to the Salvadoran food.\n\nIn spite of their low market price, pupusas represent an important element in the economy of El Salvador. In addition to whole pupusas, the individual ingredients are also exported; in 2005 for example, US$604,408 worth of loroco, sometimes used as a pupusa filling, was sold to the United States alone.\nFrozen pupusas can be found in the refrigerated section of many Hispanic and international supermarkets in the United States, especially ones that are located in highly concentrated areas of Salvadorans such as Washington, D.C. and Long Island, New York.\n\nPupusa sales play a significant role in the Salvadoran economy. According to the Salvadoran Ministry of Economy between the years of 2001–2003, pupuserias generated 22 million dollars. The export of ingredients such as loroco has also helped boost the economy. As of 2005, 300,000 people made pupusas for a living, with a majority of them being women.\n\n"}

Over the centuries, tureens have appeared in many different forms, some round, rectangular, or made into fanciful shapes such as animals or wildfowl. Tureens may be ceramic—either the glazed earthenware called faience or porcelain—or silver, and customarily they stand on an undertray or platter made en suite. \n\nThe tureen as a piece of tableware called a \"pot à oille\"—a Catalan-Provençal soup— came into use in the later seventeenth-century France. Whether named to honour the French military hero Marshal Turenne or related to the earlier word \"terrine\", a borrowing from the French for 'a large, circular, earthenware dish'.\n\nThe tureen's prehistory may be traced to the use of the communal bowl, but during the reign of Louis XIV it was developed from a practical covered serving vessel into one of the most richly ornamented centerpieces of the formal apparatus of dining. This period also saw the old practice of dressing the dinner table with every dish at once (\"service à la française\") superseded by the new practice of separate courses at meal time (\"service à la Russe)\", each \"entrée\" entering from the kitchens with an air of ceremony. \nSoup remained the first course of most meals, from the king's table to the peasant's, and the soup tureen on its serving platter provided the opening ceremony. Tureens naturally tended towards the impressive; the world's record auction price fetched for a single piece of silver was achieved by a silver tureen made in 1733 by the Parisian silversmith Thomas Germain, sold at Sotheby's New York, 13 November 1996: at US$ 10,287,500, tripling the former record. \n\nMost seventeenth-century French silver tureens were melted down to finance the wars of Louis' late years and may be glimpsed only in paintings. The ornate silver tureens of that period figure in \"buffets\"—still life of silver and game—by artists such as Alexandre-François Desportes, or in more modest still life, such as the painting by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin (\"illustration\"), which is dated 1728 but depicts a silver tureen of Baroque form of the first decade of the century.\nDuring the mid-eighteenth century, tureens in appropriate naturalistic shapes, such as tureens in the form of a head of cabbage, were popular. The Chelsea porcelain manufactory produced tureens in the form of rabbits: a Chelsea sale catalogue of 1755 advertised a \"Fine tureen in the form of a rabbit as big as life.\"\n\nTureens are most practical for serving about six people. In eighteenth-century France, a small individual covered standing bowl on a small platter, essentially an individual tureen, was called an écuelle (also anglicised to ecuelle). It could be lifted by its twin handles and drunk from directly. The shape was used for other purposes; it is often found in toilet services, where its purpose is uncertain. Its modern descendant in tableware is the two-handled cream soup bowl on matching plate. A small covered dish for sauce, called a \"saucière\", could also take the form of a small tureen; it might be integral with its platter (\"illustration right\"), for ease in handling and to contain drips.\n\nJohn T. Dorrance, a member of the family owners of Campbell's Soup, assembled, starting in 1966, the largest representative collection of soup tureens, which has been donated to the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum.\n\n\"Beautiful soup, so rich, and green/Waiting in a hot tureen\" was apostrophized by the Mock Turtle in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865). \n\n"}
{"id": "1663823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1663823", "title": "Panela", "text": "Panela\n\nPanela () or rapadura (Portuguese pronunciation: ) is unrefined whole cane sugar, typical of Central, and of Latin America in general, which is a solid form of sucrose derived from the boiling and evaporation of sugarcane juice. Panela is known by other names in Latin America, such as chancaca in Peru, piloncillo in Mexico (where \"panela\" refers to a type of cheese, \"queso panela\"). The name \"piloncillo\" means \"little loaf\", because of the traditional shape in which this smoky, caramelly and earthy sugar is produced. It has far more flavor than brown sugar, which is generally just white sugar with a small amount of molasses added back to it. Just like brown sugar, there are two varieties of piloncillo; one is lighter (blanco) and one darker (oscuro). Unrefined, it is commonly used in Mexico, where it has been around for at least 500 years. Made from crushed sugar cane, the juice is collected, boiled and poured into molds, where it hardens into blocks. Panela is also known as rapadura in Portuguese. In Australia the locals have aptly named it \"Uluru Dust\" due to its brown colour, dusty texture and dirt-like taste. Elsewhere in the world, the word jaggery describes a similar foodstuff. Both of them are considered non-centrifugal cane sugars.\n\nPanela is sold in many forms, including liquid, granulated, and solid blocks, and is used in the canning of foods as well as in confectionery, soft drinks, baking, and vinegar, beer and wine-making.\n\n\nThe main producer of panela is Colombia (about 1.4 million tons/year), where panela production is one of the most important economic activities, with the highest index of panela consumption per capita worldwide. Panela is also produced in Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Bolivia (where it is called \"chankaka\" or \"empanizao\").\n\nIn Colombia, the panela industry is an important source of employment, with about 350,000 people working in nearly 20,000 \"trapiches\" (panela farms). In 2003, Colombian sugarcane contributed 4.2% of the value of agricultural production (not counting coffee) and 1.9% of national agricultural activity of that country. That year, it was ninth in contributions to production value.\n\nSimilarly, it represents 10.7% of the area for permanent crops and 6.2% of the total area cultivated in Colombia, sixth place among the country's crops, behind only coffee, corn, rice, bananas, and cotton. This product is produced predominantly in the rural economy, the basic economy of 236 municipalities in 12 national departments.\n\nAn estimated 70,000 farm units cultivate sugarcane for mills, which generate more than 25 million annually in wages, employing around 350,000 people, or 12% of the economically active rural population, making it the second-largest employer after agricultural coffee production.\n\nWorldwide, the Colombians are the largest consumers of sugarcane, at more than 34.2 kg per capita. To the extent it is a low-cost sweetener with important contributions of minerals and trace amounts of vitamins, high intake occurs mainly in strata. Panela consumption represents 2.18% of expenditures on food and in some areas accounts for up to 9% of food expenditures in low-income sectors.\n\nPanela was originally created as an easier way to transport sugar.\n\nIt is used to make \"chancaca\". In Peru, \"chancaca\" is used in typical food such as \"champús\", \"picarones\", \"calabaza al horno\", and \"mazamorra cochina\". In Costa Rica, it is used in preparations such as \"tapa de dulce\" and \"agua de sapo\". In Chile, it's used for sweet sopaipilla.\n\nThe main use of the panela in Colombia is for \"aguapanela\", one of the most widely consumed beverages in Colombia. It is also used in the preparation of \"guarapo\" and various desserts. Since it is a very solid block, some Colombian homes have a hard river stone (\"la piedra de la panela\") to break the panela into smaller, more manageable pieces. Panela can be purchased in markets, local grocers, and online stores. In parts of coastal Colombia, it is also used for \"chancacas\".\n\nKnown as \"piloncillo\" in México, it is most often seen in the shape of small, truncated cones. Many Mexican desserts are made with\" piloncillo\", such as \"atole, capirotada, champurrado\" and \"flan\". It is also blended with different spices, such as anise, cayenne, or chocolate.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"panocha\" or in Tagalog term \"panutsá\", is traditionally used as an ingredient for \"latík\" and \"kalamay\", as well as a comfort food eaten straight.\n\nIn Venezuela, it is an essential ingredient for many typical recipes, although production of panela in the country dropped precipitously across the 20th century.\n\nPanela manufacturers and advocates claim the substance to be healthier than refined sugar, suggesting it has immunological benefits, a lower glycemic index, and higher micronutrient content. As the authors of \"The Ultimate Guide to Sugars and Sweeteners\" point out, \"it's still sugar\", with only a trace amount more vitamins and minerals, and little research to support other claims.\n\nThe National Panela Pageant takes place in the town of Villeta, Cundinamarca, in Colombia. This town is famous for its production of sugarcane, but the festivities occur in almost all national departments of Colombia in January of each year. Villeta is located 91 km from Bogota and has 37,300 inhabitants. The festival has been celebrated since 1977 as a tribute to the hard work and craftsmanship with which the peasants of the region make panela. It creates a sense of regional and national unity and the sharing of a common bond. Each year, a National Queen is crowned, on the basis of beauty, popularity, and knowledge about the production and marketing of panela.\n\n\n"}

It became popular in the 18th century throughout the Habsburg Empire. Strudel is part of Austrian cuisine but also common in many other Central and Eastern European cuisines.\n\nThe oldest strudel recipes (a Millirahmstrudel and a turnip strudel) are from 1696, in a handwritten cookbook at the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus (formerly Wiener Stadtbibliothek). The pastry descends from similar Near Eastern pastries (see \"baklava\" and \"Turkish cuisine\").\n\nStrudel is an English loanword from German. The word derives from the German word \"Strudel\", which in Middle High German literally means \"whirlpool\" or \"eddy\".\n\nThe best-known strudels are Apfelstrudel (German for apple strudel) and Topfenstrudel (with sweet soft quark, in Austrian German Topfen), followed by the Millirahmstrudel (Milk-cream strudel, Milchrahmstrudel). Other strudel types include sour cherry (\"Weichselstrudel\"), sweet cherry, nut filled (\"Nussstrudel\"), Apricot Strudel, Plum Strudel, poppy seed strudel (\"Mohnstrudel\"), and raisin strudel. There are also savoury strudels incorporating spinach, cabbage, potato, pumpkin, and sauerkraut, and versions containing meat fillings like the \"Lungenstrudel\" or \"Fleischstrudel\".\n\nTraditional Hungarian, Austrian, Polish, and Czech strudel pastry is different from strudels elsewhere, which are often made from puff pastry. The traditional strudel pastry dough is very elastic. It is made from flour with a high gluten content, water, oil and salt, with no sugar added. The dough is worked vigorously, rested, and then rolled out and stretched by hand very thinly with the help of a clean linen tea towel or kitchen paper. Purists say that it should be so thin that you can read a newspaper through it. A legend has it that the Austrian Emperor's perfectionist cook decreed that it should be possible to read a love letter through it. The thin dough is laid out on a tea towel, and the filling is spread on it. The dough with the filling on top is rolled up carefully with the help of the tea towel and baked in the oven.\n\nRegional apple varieties prevail with choice based on firm to semi-firm texture once baked. Tasting notes are acidic with apple flavor. Varieties include Belle de Boskoop, Stayman Winesap, Gravenstein, Newtown Pippin, Bramley's Seedling, Karmijn de Sonnaville, Zabergau Reinette, Yellow Transparent, Calville Blanc, Granny Smith, Glockenapfel, Jonagold, Jonathan, Northern Spy, and Rhode Island Greening.\n\n"}

In May 2014, Kraft Foods announced it was dropping the word \"steak\" from the A.1. name reverting to A.1 Sauce, to \"reflect modern dining habits\". Although the sauce is widely available in the U.S. and Canada, in the UK it is currently sold only by Tesco, Costco and Ocado.\n\nIn 1824 Henderson William Brand, a chef to King George IV of the United Kingdom, created the original sauce on which A.1. is based. A popular myth has it that the king declared it \"A.1.\" and the name was born. It went into commercial production under the Brand & Co. label in 1831, marketed as a condiment for \"fish, meat and fowl\", and continued production under this label after bankruptcy forced ownership of Brand & Co. to be transferred to W.H. Withall in 1850. It was renamed A.1. in 1873, after a trademark dispute between creator Henderson William Brand and Dence & Mason, who had since purchased Brand & Co. from Withall. It continued to be produced by Brand & Co. until the late 1950s at the firm's factory in Vauxhall, London. A.1. was officially registered as a trademark in the U.S. in 1895, and imported and distributed in the United States by G.F. Heublein & Brothers in 1906.

Its general design is four upright posts with two adjustable horizontal bar catches (also called \"supports,\" \"rails\" or \"pins\") on each side. Many power racks also have accessory attachments, such as a chin-up bar, pulldown cable attachment, or pegs for storing weight plates.\n\nThere are 3 types of power racks. A four-post rack features four large posts, a chin-up bar, safety spot bars and sometimes weight storage. A four-post multi-rack has shorter front posts and an open top to allow for standing overhead presses without restriction. Finally, there is a two-post half-rack that has an open design and takes up less space in the weight room. A number of attachments or accessories could be added to a power rack to increase the range of training options.\n\nThe power rack was probably invented in the ‘40s by Bob Peoples, an American deadlift-record-holder. There is also evidence that weightlifter Paul Anderson used a homemade power rack.\n\nThe power rack became popular in the ‘60s, when Terry Todd and Dr. Craig Whitehead used them to test their \"theory of maximum fatigue.\" Peary Rader then devoted a long article to the subject in his \"Iron Man\" magazine. Dr. John Bosley Ziegler and Bob Hoffman, owner of York Barbell, popularized power rack training as part of their Hoffman-Ziegler Isometric System. \n\nA newer form of power rack that was developed in the middle of ’90s, is the half rack. It utilizes two or four vertical posts (with cantilevered bar catches) that the user stands in front of, in contrast to standing in the center of four posts in a conventional rack. The first half racks were developed at the University of Nebraska. \n\nThe power rack serves several purposes. Chief among them is safety: for instance, in the bench press, placing the bar catches right above the lifter's chest will prevent the barbell from crushing the athlete in the case of muscular fatigue or other loss of control of the bar. In the case of squats, catches placed just below the lowest position of the squat allow the lifter to \"dump\" the weight safely.\n\nThe power rack is also useful for performing limited-range exercises, often involving heavier weights than their full-range equivalents. These include rack pulls, a variation of the deadlift where the starting point of the bar is higher than a conventional deadlift, and rack lockouts, a bench press variation limited to just the upper portion of the lift (the \"lockout\"). As noted by a strength trainer C.S. Sloan, “it enables you to train in complete safety while using the heaviest weight possible and to perform bottom-position movements and lockout exercises you wouldn't be able to use otherwise.”\n"}

In Teruel, Aragon, migas includes chorizo and bacon, and is often served with grapes.\n\nIn La Mancha, \"migas manchegas\" is a more elaborate preparation using basically the same ingredients as Aragonese migas.\n\nIn Almería and Murcia, in southeastern Spain, migas is similar to North African couscous, using flour and water, but no bread. Preparations commonly include a variety of ingredients, including fish. In Almería it is traditional to cook them when it rains.\n\nMigas is also a traditional dish in Portuguese cuisine. It is usually made with leftover bread, either wheat bread traditionally associated with the Alentejo region in Southern Portugal, or corn bread as used in Beira. In Alentejo migas can also be made with potatoes (\"Migas de Batata\") and no bread is included.\n\nGarlic and olive oil are always an ingredient. Other ingredients such as pork meat drippings, wild asparagus, tomato, and seasonings such red pepper paste and fresh coriander are usually included in Alentejo, while in Beira the other ingredients typically are cooked kale cut in caldo verde style, cooked beans (pinto or kidney beans) and sometimes cooked rice.\n\nMigas usually accompanies meats or other main dishes.\n\nIn different areas of Mexico, migas is a traditional breakfast dish consisting of corn tortilla strips fried on a pan or griddle until almost crispy, to which eggs are then added to create a scrambled egg/fried tortilla mixture. This preparation makes use of hardened corn tortillas left over from previous meals. Chilaquiles is a similar meal that substitutes salsa for eggs during cooking. Both are hearty, inexpensive working-class breakfast meals.\n\nMexico City also has its own version of migas. It is a garlic soup which is thickened with sliced day-old bolillos. It is usually flavored with pork shanks, ham bones, epazote, oregano and different types of dried chillies. A raw egg is usually added to each plate when served and it is slowly cooked by the warm soup, similar to egg drop soup. It is a very popular dish in fondas around downtown Mexico city, especially in Tepito.\n\nThere is also a Tex-Mex variation of Mexican migas. This includes additional ingredients, such as diced onions, sliced chile peppers, diced fresh tomatoes, or cheese, as well as various spices and condiments (e.g., salsa or \"pico de gallo\").\n\nMigas is typically served with refried beans, and corn or flour tortillas may be used to enfold all of the ingredients into tacos.

Essentially, Cocoa Puffs are Kix cereal with chocolate flavoring; similarly, Trix has been, for most of its existence, fruit-flavored Kix.\n\nCocoa Puffs are sold in Canada, Latin America, and Europe under the Nesquik brand, via a partnership between Nestlé and General Mills.\n\nOn several occasions, Cocoa Puffs boxes stated that they are made with real Hershey's cocoa.\n\nIn December 2009, General Mills announced that it would cut the sugar in 10 cereals including Cocoa Puffs to less than 10 grams of sugar per serving. This could represent a 25% decline in the sugar content from the original level and 18% from the 2009 level of 11 grams per serving.\n\nA cereal bar of Cocoa Puffs has been made. A layer of dried, sweetened condensed milk is added to the bottom, and marketed as a substitute for a bowl of milk and cereal.\n\nA new addition was introduced in the summer of 2008, Cocoa Puffs Combos, which consists of the recognizable chocolate puffs with vanilla puffs. Unlike original Cocoa Puffs, the Combos cereal does not contain cocoa; instead, it contains artificial, imitation cocoa.\n\nBesides Cocoa Puffs Combos, there have been varieties of the popular cereal. One such example was Cocoa Puffs Brownie Crunch in 2011. That cereal was described on the front of the box as \"naturally and artificially flavored sweetened chocolate squares.\"\n\nThe mascot of Cocoa Puffs is Sonny the Cuckoo Bird, introduced in 1962. In television commercials, Sonny attempts to concentrate on a normal task but ends up coming across some reference to Cocoa Puffs themselves (usually described by the adjectives \"munchy, crunchy, chocolatey\") and bursts with enthusiasm, exclaiming his catchphrase \"I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!\" Sonny was voiced by Chuck McCann from 1962 to 1978, and has been voiced by Larry Kenney since 1978.\n\nSonny's name comes from the original format of the commercials, in which he was paired with his grandfather (also voiced by McCann). Rather than proper names, they always referred to each other as \"Gramps\" and \"Sonny.\" When the grandfather was dropped from the ads, \"Sonny\" remained as the character's name. In 2010, Gramps returned to the Cocoa Puffs ads, with McCann reprising his role as Gramps and Kenney continuing to voice Sonny.\n\nSonny was designed by Gene Cleaves; animation pioneer \"Grim\" Natwick, of Fleischers' Betty Boop history, also contributed to the early images of Sonny and Gramps, according to then-contemporaries who collaborated with Natwick during his 100-year career. Sonny was originally depicted as wearing a pink-and-white striped shirt, then in 1995 was redesigned, this time wearing 1990s \"extreme\" clothes and being given a more Disney-esque appearance.

It is a common cuisine eaten in most former Castilian territories in Latin America and the Philippines. The first written references to the Majorcan ensaïmada date back to the 17th century. At that time, although wheat flour was mainly used for making bread, there is evidence that this typical pastry product was made for festivals and celebrations.\n\nThe \"ensaïmada de Mallorca\" is made with strong flour, water, sugar, eggs, mother dough and a kind of reduced pork lard named \"saïm\". The handmade character of the product makes it difficult to give an exact formula, so scales have been established defining the proportion of each ingredient, giving rise to an excellent quality traditional product. The name comes from the Catalan word \"saïm\", which means 'pork lard' (from the Arabic \"shahim\", meaning 'fat').\n\nIn Mallorca and Ibiza there is a sweet called greixonera made with ensaïmada pieces left over from the day before.\n\nAmong the variants of ensaimada the most common are:\n\nThe Philippines also adopted the Majorcan ensaïmada (commonly spelled \"ensaymada\" in Philippine languages). As a Spanish colony for over 300 years, the Philippine variant has evolved over the centuries and is perhaps one of the most common delicacies in the country. The localized pastry is a brioche baked with butter instead of lard and topped with grated cheese and sugar. Upscale versions of ensaymada can be topped with butter cream and sugar. During Christmas season, it is a tradition to top the pastry with a specially aged type of Edam cheese called \"queso de bola\". It is also customary to eat ensaymada with hot chocolate and strawberries during Christmas. Due to its extreme popularity as a snack across the islands, popular bakeshop chains such as Goldilocks, Red Ribbon, Julie's and Kamuning Bakery also offer ensaymada with their own recipe.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, another Spanish colony until 1898, the ensaïmada is called \"Mallorca\" and is traditionally eaten for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.\n\n"}

Sobrassada, along with botifarró are traditional Balearic meat products prepared in the laborious but festive rites that still mark the autumn and winter pig slaughter known as a \"matança\" (in Spanish, \"matanza\") in Majorca and Ibiza. The chemical principle that makes sobrassada is the dehydration of meat under certain weather conditions (high humidity and mild cold) which are typical of the late Balearic autumn.\n\nAfter centuries of Muslim rule of Spain, pork consumption returned to the region in the Middle Ages. Paprika was added after the spice was brought back from the Americas in the 15th century. Sobrassada is thought to have originated and expanded, as a culinary concept, in the Crown of Aragon-controlled Western Mediterranean (Sicily, Balearic Islands, Sardinia) after the 14th century, as similar sausages are still made in this region.\n\nIn a traditional Mediterranean diet, containing little meat, as Majorca had until the 1950s, sobrassada and related pork sausages were the main and sometimes only sources of pork for Majorcans. Larger meat cuts such as pork or lamb roasts, pork steaks or beef cuts were largely festive dishes, or restricted to the well-off. Even today dishes such as \"porcella rostida\", a whole roasted suckling pig, are only served on special occasions.\n\nSobrassada is made with a choice of pork loin, pork bacon (locally called \"xuia\"), minced and mixed with paprika, salt and black pepper at the ends (to deter insects). Some makers also add cayenne pepper to the mixture and market it as \"coent\", hot. Then the mixture is put into a pork intestine, and hung from a pole for some weeks until it is cured. The string which is tied around the intestine can be used to differentiate between the hot and \"dolç\" (literally \"sweet\", though in this case meaning \"not spicy\") varieties, the red or red and white string being the hot one.\n\nSmall, thin sobrassadas are called \"llonganissa\", and are made from the small intestine. Bigger and thicker ones are called \"cular\" or \"pultrums\", and the largest type are huge pork bladders called \"bufetes\" or \"bisbe\" (bishop). Thicker varieties take longer to cure, staggering its consumption through the year (thinner during winter, thicker during summer-autumn).\n\nFour geographical areas in the Mediterranean, apart from the Balearic Islands, have close links to sobrassada for different reasons:\n\n\nBotifarró is a pork intestine filled with coarsely ground pork cuts, including liver, and spiced with salt, pepper and aniseed, which gives this sausage its characteristic flavor. The sausages are boiled and eaten immediately. Botifarró is specific to Majorca, but very similar sausages can be found in the Spanish provinces of Tarragona, Castellón, Valencia and Alicante. Other pork products typical from the cuisine of Majorca are \"camaïot\", \"veria negra\" and \"xuia\" (pancetta).\n\n\n"}

The Blaster was a liquefied petroleum gas flamethrower installed along the sides of the vehicle under the doors. Should a group of carjackers suddenly attack the vehicle while it is stopped in traffic (the typical scenario), the occupant could flip a switch and direct 5 metre plumes of flame upward into the facial area of anyone trying to enter the vehicle through the doors or windows. Fourie claims it is unlikely to kill but would \"definitely blind\" the assailant. In South Africa, it is legal to use lethal force in self-defence if in fear of one's life, and ownership of flamethrowers is unrestricted.\n\nThe device was controversial in South Africa, with some (including the Automobile Association of South Africa [AA]) speculating that the device might cause more carjackers to simply murder drivers with gunfire as a precautionary measure before approaching the vehicle, a tactic which was already fairly common.\n\nIn any case, the device was not banned (as is sometimes reported), but the high price tag limited its market and made it unprofitable. By 2001, only a few hundred had been sold, and the device was taken off the market by Fourie, who instead started marketing a less expensive pocket-sized \"personal flamethrower\". 2009 statistics report the murder rate in South Africa has decreased by nearly 50% since 1999, but the assault rate has stayed steady and the carjacking and rape rates have increased, remaining the highest per capita in the world, and there is still some use of Blaster-equipped vehicles in Johannesburg and elsewhere.\n\nThe Blaster received ample (and often satirical) media coverage from abroad. In particular, it earned its inventor the 1999 Ig Nobel Peace Prize (a parody of the real Nobel Prizes).\n\n\n"}

The beans in gallo pinto are quickly cooked until the juice is almost consumed, then combined with readied rice, and other ingredients such as cooked bell peppers, chopped onions, and garlic. \n\nThe history of gallo pinto is found in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, where the dish originated. One theory suggests that gallo pinto was brought into Latin America by African slaves.\n\nGallo pinto means \"spotted rooster\" in Spanish. The name is said to originate in the multi-colored or speckled appearance that results from cooking the rice and the use of pinto beans. It is called \"pinto\" by Costa Ricans.\n\nGallo pinto is one of many various Latin American plates which involve the preparation of the most integral ingredients for many cultures: rice and beans. Gallo pinto is considered to be a product of mestizos; a combination of beans, cultivated by Indigenous people of pre-Colombian time, and rice, a grain introduced by the Spanish. The cooking and preparation is heavily influenced by African cooking.\n\nRice, originally from Asia, was introduced by Arabs in Spain and became a main but versatile ingredients in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. With the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the Spanish introduced rice quickly to Mexico and South America. It is suggested that within the eighteenth century, the cultivation of rice became relevant to Central America. Asian rice was cultivated by Africans in the neolithic period, and with their arrival to the Americas as slaves by Europeans, they were already accustomed to eating rice. so this occurred as well with beans, which were cultivated centuries prior. On their travels to America, slaves were given bowls and a wooden spoon from which they ate twice a day. They ate primarily beans and European or African rice, along with maize, yams, cassava and sponge cake. \n\nAs Africans were forced to settle in the continent, various forms of rice and beans began to take form. Because the Americas had many types of beans cultivated by Indigenous people, combined with rice, gave rise to a range of dishes.\n\nIn the Americas, there are many dishes with a base of beans and rice, which vary in their cooking and additional ingredients. Variations exist regionally, as cultures shape the dishes to their own preferences. In countries near or in the Caribbean, these dishes are simply known as \"rice and beans\", in which the dish is cooked in coconut milk.

It consists of corn dough stuffed with a stew of beef, pork, or chicken and other ingredients such as raisins, capers, and olives Like some tamales, hallacas are folded in plantain leaves, tied with strings, and boiled; The dish is traditionally served during the Christmas season and has several regional variants in Venezuela. It has been described as a national dish of Venezuela. A characteristic of the hallaca is the delicate corn dough made with consommé or broth and lard colored with annatto. Hallacas are also commonly consumed in eastern Cuba parts of Colombia, and Ecuador.\n\nHallaca is a Mesoamerican tamal-like dish that goes by various names and spread throughout the Spanish kingdoms in the Americas as far south as Argentina in the decades following the conquest.\n\nAccording to Adolfo Ernst, the word \"hallaca\" evolved from the indigenous Guarani language, stemming from the verb \"ayua\" or \"ayuar\", meaning \"to mix or blend\". From there, the construction \"ayuaca\" (mixed things) devolved to \"ayaca\" and ultimately to \"hayaca\" or \"hallaca\" (using Spanish silent \"h\" when written). Another version presumes that the word comes from an aboriginal language of the West of the country, whose meaning is \"wrapping\" or \"bojote\".The earliest use of the word in the modern sense is in a 1781 document of Italian missionary linguist Filippo Salvatore Gilii.\n\nHallaca is a staple of Venezuelan Christmas celebrations and its preparation is practically limited to that time of the year. The dish is also an icon of Venezuelan multicultural heritage, as its preparation includes European ingredients (such as raisins, almonds and olives), indigenous ingredients (corn meal colored with annatto seeds and onions), and African ingredients (smoked plantain leaves used for wrapping).\n\nIn contrast to Venezuelan tradition, hallacas are popular year-round in Ecuador, and several variants exist across the country's different regions. Along with humitas, they are a staple of traditional Ecuadorian cuisine.\n\nIn Aruba and Curaçao, two islands just off the coast of Falcón state, Venezuela, it is called 'ayaca' or 'ayaka'. The ingredients are pork and chicken stew, or pork or chicken stew, capers, raisins, cashews, bellpepper, pickled baby onions, prunes, and olives. The dough is made from white cornmeal, and the ayaca leaves first spread with lard or oil. Cooked meat and other ingredients are then wrapped in ayaca leaves, tied with string and then boiled for about 2 hours. Flavors in the ayaca vary from family to family, and some add madam Jeanet peppers (very hot).\n\nProbably it came to the island by immigrants, or the recipe was borrowed. Like many things from other cultures, it has become a part of the Aruban and Curaçaoan Christmas food traditions adopted as in Trinidad.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, the hayaca or hallaca used to be a popular part of the local gastronomy. The hayaca from Puerto Rico is not made with corn nor fried, boiled or steamed. It is baked, traditionally, in open-wood-fire to a smokey and toasted outer layer. Different from other cultures, the unique mix of ingredients like the cassava, milk, annatto, banana leaf and interesting style of open-wood-fire cooking, suggests that this local version might have been introduced by a combination of the Taíno tribes and either African slaves or Spaniards during the Spanish colonization. Because of the long and elaborate process and skills that takes to prepare, the hayaca is now rarely available but still found, mostly in coastal, family-owned restaurants and other small establishments known as \"kioscos\" where there are still strong ties to native heritage and classic slow cooking skills.\n\nThe traditional \"hallaca\" is made by extending a plantain leaf, greasing it with a spoonful of annatto-colored cooking oil and spreading on it a round portion of corn dough (roughly 30 cm), which is then sprinkled with various fillings. While no two families make \"hallaca\"s in quite the same way, the most common fillings include a mix of stewed (or rare) meats (pork, poultry, beef, lard, crisp or pork rind), raisins and pitted green olives. Pepper-filled olives are becoming more popular nowadays. People in Los Llanos add boiled eggs and pieces of red pepper. Others might add chickpeas, nuts and almonds.\n\nThe filled dough is then skillfully wrapped in an oblong fashion and tied with string in a typical square mesh before its cooking in boiling water. Afterwards, it is picked from the pail with a fork, unwrapped and served on its own plantain leaves with chicken salad, \"pan de jamón\" (ham filled bread) or plain bread. In the Andean region, the filling is cooked with the rest of the \"hallaca\", while in the rest of the country it is usually cooked beforehand.\n\nThe ideal \"hallaca\" has a silky golden-reddish glow. In taste, it aims to balance the saltiness of the meats and olives with the sweetness of the raisins and of the dough itself.\n\nAfter making a number of \"hallaca\"s, the remaining portion of ingredients is occasionally mixed together in order to obtain a uniform dough. The dough undergoes the same \"hallaca\" wrap and cooking preparation, although typically smaller in size and much fewer in number. The result is the bollo, which may be offered as a lighter option to the \"hallaca\" at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\nAfter cooking, \"hallaca\"s can be frozen for several weeks with no change in flavor. It not unusual for some families to eat \"hallaca\"s as late as May or June of the next year.\n\nIngredients differ from region to region and from family to family. It is not uncommon to find \"hallaca\"s with chickpeas, tomato, bell pepper, pickled vegetables, and garlic. Potatoes are included in the Andean variation. Also, some of the traditional ingredients may be substituted by local variants such as fish and lobster (East Coast) and plantain dough (Maracaibo).\n\n\"Hallaca\"-making requires many hours of intense work, so \"hallaca\"s are typically made all in one go, in large enough quantities to last the entire holiday season (from a few dozen to several hundred). \"Hallaca\" making is a logistical feat and an economic stretch for many. The most important Venezuelan newspapers usually carry stories in their Economics sections at the beginning of December noting the rise in the cost of making \"hallaca\"s.\n\n\"Hallaca\"-making reunites family members at holiday time. It is a job joyfully done by whole families together, marking the start of the holiday festivities. However, the most important part of \"hallaca-preparation\" is that it represents one of the strongest holiday family traditions in Venezuela, comparable perhaps to Thanksgiving in United States.\n\nThe \"hallaca\" making party tends to be matriarchal, with grandmothers and/or mothers leading the preparation. Foreigners in Venezuela in December are often struck by how often they are offered \"hallaca\"s.\n\nFriendly rivalry over whose \"hallaca\"s are the best is part of the Venezuelan holiday culture, leading to the popular saying \"la mejor \"hallaca\" es la que hace mi mamá\"  – the best \"hallaca\" is the one my mother makes – an expression of familism. This expression was immortalized in a holiday song by Venezuelan pop singer Raquel Castaño.\n\n\n"}

These are combined with sugar and other flavorings, cooked in ghee and molded into a ball shape. Some laddu recipes are prepared using Ayurvedic medicinal ingredients, including methi laddu, multigrain and resin laddu. Nuts such as pistachios and almonds are commonly stuffed into laddus.\n\nBoondi laddu or Bundiar Laddu is made from bengal gram flour (Besan) based boondi. It is often served on festivals such as Raksha Bandhan and Diwali.\n\nMotichoor laddu is made from fine boondi where the balls are tiny and is cooked with ghee or oil. The recipe for this laddu originated in north India, however, it is now popular throughout the Indian subcontinent.\n\nBesan laddu is a popular Indian sweet dish made of besan (chickpea flour or gram flour), sugar and ghee. Besan is roasted in ghee till golden brown appearance with nutty fragrance. Then sugar is added to it. Pistachio pieces are also mixed in this mixture optionally. Sweet balls are then made from this mixture. It has a long shelf life. It is often served at festivals, family events and religious occasions in India.\n\nThere are multiple coconut laddu recipes. Its earliest form \"Narayl Nakru\" dates back to the time of the Chola Empire, when it was a sweet that was packed for travelers and warriors as a symbol of good luck for their expeditions.\n\nPedha (cream balls) is a popular dessert in the Indian subcontinent, prepared from Khoa (milk solids by evaporation). In India, among Hindus, it is often prepared as an offering to the gods.\n\nThis a laddu prepared from rava (semolina), sugar and ghee. A variant on the recipe includes Khoa as an additional ingredient.\n\nIn India, these are traditionally given to lactating mothers as they help in the production of milk. The laddus are called Dinkache ladoo in Marathi and Gond ka laddu in Hindi.\nThe main ingredient is gum arabic which is collected from the Babhul tree. Other ingredients include\ncoconut, almonds, cashews, dates, spices such as nutmeg and cardamom, poppy seeds, ghee, and sugar.\n\nAn alternative multigrain recipe will have a portion of gum replaced by grains and legume flours such as besan, urid, ragi (nachani in Marathi) and wheat.\n\nOatmeal laddu is the variation of the traditional sweet dish. This laddu prepared with roasted white sesame seeds, oats,mixed nuts, ghee, green cardamom powder and jaggery. Other additional ingredient use in recipe a khoya.\n\nLaddu can be prepared from a variety of grains, legumes or seeds. Some popular ones include laddu made with roasted wheat, amaranth, garden cress seeds, fenugreek seeds, and peanuts respectively.\n\nThe largest individual laddu weighs and was achieved by PVVS Mallikharjuna Rao (India), in Tapeswaram, Andhra Pradesh, India, on 6 September 2016.\nThe laddu was made to a traditional Boondi recipe. The ingredients included ghee, refined oil, cashew nuts, sugar, almonds, cardamom, and water.\n\nLaddu is often prepared for festivals or family events such as weddings and births, or given as a prasadam(religious offering of food) at Hindu temples, especially at Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh, it is famous with the name Tirupati Laddu. Laddu is considered a traditional Eid dessert in some Muslim communities.\n\nIn Maharashtrian cuisine, there are traditional recipes for laddu intended as travel provisions.\n\nIn the Sesame Street episode \"Rakhi Road\", laddus are featured prominently as a favoured Indian dessert. Elmo is shown making laddus and enjoying eating them as part of the celebrations around the Indian festival of Rakhi.\n\nA laddu weighing 6,300 kg was made for a Ganesh festival in Andhra Pradesh, India in September 2012. This was claimed to be the largest known laddu.\n\nIn the movie \"English Vinglish\", the protagonist Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a housewife who makes and sells laddoos for living.\n\n"}

In some countries it is sold as Coca-Cola No Sugar.\n\nThe drink was introduced in 2005 as Coca-Cola Zero as a new no-calorie cola. In 2017, the formula was modified and the name updated, a change which led to some backlash.\n\nCoca-Cola Zero was Coca-Cola's largest product launch in 22 years. The global campaign was done by creative agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky. It was marketed as having a taste that is indistinguishable from standard Coca-Cola, as opposed to Diet Coke, which has a different flavor profile.\n\nIn 2017, despite increasing sales in the United States, the Coca-Cola Company announced that Coca-Cola Zero would be reformulated and rebranded as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, intended to taste more like standard Coca-Cola while emphasizing the lack of sugar content. The new formula was first tested in the United Kingdom in June 2016, with plans to roll it out in other countries in the following months. \n\nThe move caused some vocal backlash. \"The Washington Post\" noted Coke Zero is very popular, and that fans compared the change to the launch of New Coke in 1985. However, \"Beverage Digest\" executive editor Duane Stanford noted that it was very similar in flavor, and that the formula likely was tweaked only slightly as the ingredients list is the same. He noted that the rebranding was the main emphasis.\n\nIn Australia, the soda was relaunched as \"Coca-Cola No Sugar\" in 2017 but had trouble gaining initial acceptance.\n\nThe original Coca-Cola Zero logo generally featured the Coca-Cola logo in red script with white trim, with the word \"zero\" underneath in lower case in the geometric typeface Avenir (or a customized version of it). These words appeared on a black background. Some details varied from country to country. Later packagings swapped the colors of the \"Coca-Cola\" script and \"Zero\", leaving the former in white and the latter in red.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Zero Sugar logo features the Coca-Cola logo in white script, with the words \"zero sugar\" in black underneath. The word \"zero\" is in lower case in the geometric typeface Avenir (or a customized version of it); the word \"sugar\" is in upper case. These words appear in a red disc on a black background.\n\nAll versions of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar sold in various countries are based on the same flavoring formula, and all are carbonated. One liter of Coca-Cola Zero contains 96 mg caffeine. Additionally, artificial sweeteners are used. In the U.S., this includes aspartame and acesulfame potassium. However, the exact combination of sweeteners and preservatives used varies from market to market.\n\nSodium cyclamate, a relatively inexpensive artificial sweetener banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1969 and once believed to be a carcinogen, has been used in the Coca-Cola Zero versions produced in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Venezuela, Chile, and some Central American countries. It was used for a time in Mexico, before a consumer campaign led to its removal from the drink in 2008. In June 2009, Venezuela ordered Coca-Cola to withdraw its Coca-Cola Zero product, as it contained more than the legal levels of sodium cyclamate.\n\nCoke Zero was originally specifically marketed to men, who are shown to associate \"diet\" drinks with women. It was primarily marketed towards young adult males and it has been nicknamed \"Bloke Coke\" in the UK. In the U.S., advertising has been tailored to its targeted market by describing the drink as \"calorie-free\" rather than \"diet\", since young adult males are said to associate diet drinks with women. U.S. marketing also emphasized its similarity in taste to sugared Coca-Cola; an advertising campaign for the beverage focused on Coca-Cola executives who were so angry over the drinks' similarities, they were considering suing their co-workers for \"taste infringement\". Continuing the theme, a Coca-Cola Zero ad aired during Super Bowl XLIII parodied Coke's iconic \"Hey Kid, Catch!\" commercial, which is interrupted by two Coca-Cola \"brand managers\" accusing Troy Polamalu of \"stealing\" their commercial.\n\nIn Australia, the product's launch was promoted by a fake front group; the campaign included outdoor graffiti and online spamming that mentioned a fake blog. Once exposed, consumer advocates assailed the campaign as misleading and established the Zero Coke Movement to comment on the ethics of Coke's activities.\n\nCoca-Cola Zero sponsors Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Coke Zero 400 at Daytona International Speedway in July, and also the Suzuka 8 Hours in Japan, a motorcycle endurance race.\n\nIn 2013, Coca-Cola swapped the logo on Coca-Cola, Diet Coke and Coke Zero bottles and cans in many European countries with 150 of the most popular local names for a summer-long \"Share a Coke\" campaign. The same campaign was used in North America the following summer.\n\nFor Christmas 2013, Coke Zero launched an interactive website that allowed people to customize the designs of their Christmas sweater, which have a significant role in United Kingdom Christmas traditions. On the website, people could detail the cut, pattern, and icons for their sweater, and join a popularity contest. Users could choose from Christmas trees and Santa’s head, to reindeer, sleighs, and turkeys. This initiative was tied to a social media campaign, where the top 100 sweater designs with the most votes were manufactured and shipped to the contest winners. According to the Coca-Cola Company, the website generated nearly 42,000 sweater designs in its first four days.\n\nCoke Zero and Coke Zero Sugar have been sold in:\n\n"}

The dish is often served with French fries.\n\nThe invention of currywurst is attributed to Herta Heuwer in Berlin in 1949, after she obtained ketchup (or possibly Worcestershire sauce) and curry powder from British soldiers in Germany. She mixed these ingredients with other spices and poured it over grilled pork sausage. Heuwer started selling the cheap but filling snack at a street stand in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin, where it became popular with construction workers rebuilding the devastated city. She patented her sauce under the name \"Chillup\" in 1951. At its height the stand was selling 10,000 servings per week. She later opened a small restaurant which operated until 1974. On 30 June 2013 Heuwer's 100th birthday was celebrated with a Google Doodle.\n\nToday, currywurst is often sold as a take-out/take-away food, Schnellimbisse (snack stands), at diners or \"greasy spoons,\" on children's menus in restaurants, or as a street food and usually served with french fries or bread rolls (Brötchen). It is popular all over Germany but especially in the metropolitan areas of Berlin, Hamburg and the Ruhr Area. Considerable variation, both in the type of sausage used and the ingredients of the sauce, occurs between these areas. Common variations include the addition of paprika or chopped onions; halal food stands often prepare currywurst with beef sausage. Often currywurst is sold in food booths, sometimes using a special machine to slice it into pieces, and served on a paper plate with a little wooden or plastic fork, mostly a Currywurst fork. It is also sold as a supermarket-shelf product to prepare at home, such as Meica CurryKing.\n\nThe Deutsches Currywurst Museum estimates that 800 million currywursts are eaten every year in Germany, with 70 million in Berlin alone. The Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg runs its own butchery producing about 7 million currywursts per year, serving many directly to Volkswagen employees.\n\nThe currywurst is an icon of German popular culture. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder is a noted fan of currywurst. By tradition, every candidate for the mayor of Berlin is photographed at a currywurst stand.\n\nThe song \"Currywurst\" on Herbert Grönemeyer's 1982 album \"Total Egal\" is a tribute to the snack.\n\nThe 1993 novel \"Die Entdeckung der Currywurst\" (English title: \"The Invention of Curried Sausage\", ) by Uwe Timm was made into a 1998 play and a 2008 film both of the same name. The plot is based on an alternative but unproven theory that currywurst was invented in Hamburg.\n\nThe Deutsches Currywurst Museum opened in Berlin on 15 August 2009, commemorating the 60th anniversary of its creation. Curator Martin Loewer said \"No other national German dish inspires so much history and has so many well-known fans\". The museum receives approximately 350,000 visitors annually.\n\nIn 2019 Berlin State Mint issued a commemorative currywurst coin celebrating the 70 years since the savoury snack was first sold in Berlin by Herta Heuwer. The silver alloy coin features two currywursts pierced with a wooden chip fork and poured with the sauce (coloured by print), and Herta Heuwer in the background (caption: 70 Jahre Currywurst). The other side of the coin shows the Brandenburg Gate (caption: Münze Berlin, 2019).\n\n\n"}

The meaning varies depending on the tone and context used. It can be an exclamation of pleasure, an expression of dark horror, a cry of anger, a declaration of affection, and other different things besides its literal equivalent, which in British English is \"wanker\". Common alternative meanings include \"asshole\" or \"jerk\", and the contrasting \"dude\", or \"mate\", depending on the context.\n\n\"Malakas\" derives from the Greek word \"malakos\" (), which means \"soft\" or \"spoilt, well-used to luxuries of life\". It is one of the most frequent words picked up by tourists (often in its vocative case form, i.e. \"malaka\" ) and travelers to Greece and is not unusual among the younger Greek diaspora, even when the level of Greek is low. A female form of the word exists, \"malako\" (), but is a recent coinage, whereas \"malakismeni\" () seems to be rather more vintage. In everyday speech, the word \"malakas\" is used metaphorically to mean a person who has no common sense. The term is considered inappropriate to be used with strangers, while it is acceptable among close friends, typically among males, resembling the meaning of \"dude\" or \"mate\". \n\n examines the usage of the word \"malakas\" in modern Greek through a constructivist and sociolinguistic lens, studying the effect of any and all aspects of society on the way language is used. He characterizes the term \"malakas\" as one of the most favorite, blithe and sexually malignant \"curses\" used among friends and asserts that \"malakas\", just like other Greek epithets (e.g. \"keratas\" 'cuckold', \"poustis\" 'faggot'), highlight failures of social or intellectual finesse:\n\nAccording to Faubion's sociolinguistic analysis, the \"malakas\", the \"malakismenos\", and the \"keratas\" are all figurative characters who carry the stigma of being unable to exercise sexual sovereignty or the sexual overpowering of another. However, the \"malakas\" is less pitiable compared to the feminized \"malakismenos\"\n\n\"Malakia\", literally meaning masturbation, is often also used in a similar sense as \"malakas\" to refer to nonsense, an item considered worthless, or a mistake. The use of \"malakia\" to mean \"masturbation\" traces back to medieval Greek. It is used in this sense in the \"Life of Saint Andrew the Fool\" and in the \"Life of Saint Niphon\", both of which date to the tenth century.\n\n"}

A traditional daubière is a terracotta pot that resembles a pitcher, with a concave lid. Water is poured on the lid, which condenses the moisture inside, allowing for the long cooking required to tenderize lesser cuts of meat. The meat used in daube is cut from the shoulder and back of the bull, though some suggest they should be made from three cuts of meat: the \"gelatinous shin for body, short ribs for flavor, and chuck for firmness.\" Although most modern recipes call for red wine, a minority call for white, as do the earliest recorded daube recipes.\n\nDaube is adapted in New Orleans cuisine to make daube glacé.\n\nVariations also call for olives, prunes, and flavoring with duck fat, vinegar, brandy, lavender, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, juniper berries, or orange peel. For best flavor, it is cooked in several stages, and cooled for a day after each stage to allow the flavors to meld together. In the Camargue and Béarn area of France, bulls killed in bullfighting festivals are often used for daube.\n\nTraditionally it should be cooked for a long time and prepared the night before it is served. \nDaube with lamb is traditionally made with white wine.\n\n\n"}

It is 34 proof (17% ABV) and is available in over 70 countries worldwide.\n\nHpnotiq was created in 2001 by Raphael Yakoby, a college dropout living with his parents on Long Island, New York, who, after seeing a blue perfume at Bloomingdale's, decided to create a blue liqueur. \n\nNick Storm, a Yonkers, N.Y., native who had spent six years in the music industry and met Yakoby through a common friend, partnered with him to promote it. Yakoby and Storm failed to sell the concept to major beverage manufacturers. They then promoted the drink in clubs and bars through a series of promotional events and parties which utilized Storm's music industry contacts. The big break came when hip-hop impresario Sean \"Diddy\" Combs agreed to sell the drink in his restaurant chain Justin's in New York. \n\nUrban and hip-hop groups began to promote the brand in music videos, on stage, and in rap lyrics like Kanye West, R. Kelly, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Lil’Kim, Fabulous, and Diddy. One person that was instrumental in the drink's growth is the hip-hopper Fabolous, who mentioned it in at least four songs on his album, \"Street Dreams.\" On his 2002 hit single \"This Is My Party\", Fabolous started his first verse with the following words: \"Ain't no tellin' what this Hpno' will do to me.\" A cocktail called \"Incredible Hulk\", the color being reminiscent of the famous comic book hero, was made at Combs' Justin's restaurants.\n\nThe brand was originally distributed by Wingard Inc. of Great Neck, New York; in January 2003, Yakoby's trademark and the distribution rights were acquired by Heaven Hill Distilleries. The brand earned Yakoby a reported $50 million. Hpnotiq is bottled in France's Cognac region and the vodka is premium, French, and distilled three times.

Nevertheless, they are sometimes available on the black market in cities with large expatriate West African Muslim populations. This prohibition is largely due to fear of the possibility of transmission of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease), deadly, degenerative prion diseases that are spread by ingestion of nerve and brain tissue from infected ungulates such as sheep, cows and goats. Furthermore, butchering an ungulate carcass with the skin intact and unsterilized considerably raises the risks for induction of fecal coliform bacteria such as \"E. coli\" or \"Salmonella\" into the meat and is thus banned in the UK by law. This risk is heightened because the smokies are generally produced in covert (and often grossly unsanitary) butchering facilities and handled without proper sanitary procedures. Furthermore, the goats and sheep used are traditionally old, worn-out or lame animals bought inexpensively from milk and wool farms and are not intended for human consumption.\n\nSince the process of producing a smokie requires that the skin and wool of the carcass be left in place and burned in one piece, the spinal cord is not removed from the carcass prior to consumption. Thus, consumers (however careful) may unwittingly ingest tissues from the nervous system, potentially exposing themselves to scrapie or BSE prions. For this reason, UK laws strictly forbid the sale of meat from cattle or sheep with the nervous system and skin still attached.\n\nOn 29 March 2005, and again on 6 April, the BBC television program \"Watchdog\" publicised the sale of smokies in London, two years after the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) told a conference about their production in Wales.\n\nOn 17 September 2012, BBC London TV news broadcast an exclusive report delivered by reporter Guy Lynn. They secretly recorded the illegal sale of smokies in the Ridley Road market in Dalston, Hackney. The report was reacted to with widespread condemnation and shock that little was being done to prevent the illicit trade.\n\nSome believe that meat with the skin and fur attached may contain more bacteria, and if butchered in a legal and well-maintained facility under expert supervision, the possibility of bacterial contamination would be minimized.\n\nThe Farmers' Union of Wales has called for smokies to be legalised in the United Kingdom, stating that there has not been any medical proof that the meat could be harmful.\n\n\n"}

Popularly known as CC, Canadian Club was created by Hiram Walker and Sons, an evolution of a brand around a product that took place over the second half of the nineteenth century. Hiram Walker merged with Gooderham & Worts, Ltd. in 1926, yielding Hiram Walker-Gooderham & Worts, Ltd.\n\nHiram Walker founded his distillery in 1858 in Detroit. He first learned how to distill cider vinegar in his grocery store in the 1830s before moving on to whisky and producing his first barrels in 1854. However, with the Prohibition movement gathering momentum and Michigan already becoming \"dry\", Walker decided to move his distillery across the Detroit River to Windsor, Ontario. From here, he was able to export his whisky and start to develop Walkerville, a model community that Walker financed to provide housing and services for his employees.\n\nWalker's whisky was particularly popular in the late 19th century gentlemen's clubs of the United States and Canada; hence it became known as \"Club Whisky\". Walker originally positioned the whisky as a premium liquor, pitching it not only on its smoothness and purity but also its five-year oak barrel aging.\n\nClub Whisky became very popular and American distillers petitioned for the inclusion of the word \"Canada\" on the bottle to distinguish it from their competing whiskies, thinking it would hamper the popularity of Walker's. This backfired, only making Club Whisky more exclusive. Walker saw this and changed the label again in 1889 adding the word \"Canadian\" to the top of the label, distinguishing Walker's recipe for his whisky from the other processes of the time. In 1890, the word \"Canadian\" was moved down from the top of the label and incorporated into the name of the whisky.\n\nWalker's distillery passed to his sons upon his death in 1899. At one point, the Walkers employed almost the entire population of Walkerville, where they built police and fire stations, brought in running water and installed street lights. In 1890, the Canadian government acknowledged Walkerville as a legal town. It was incorporated into Windsor in 1935.\n\nDuring the years of Prohibition, one of the distillery's most important clients was Chicago gangster Al Capone, who smuggled in thousands of cases of Canadian Club via a route from Windsor to Detroit.\n\nCanadian Club has received the royal warrants of Queen Victoria, Edward VII, George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II. Hiram Walker & Sons is the only North American distiller to have been granted a royal warrant.\n\nThe Walker distillery remains in production in Windsor. Canadian Club is now part of the Jim Beam portfolio. It is its number four–selling alcoholic product, behind Jim Beam bourbon whiskey, Sauza Tequila, and DeKuyper cordials.\n\nIn 1967, Hiram Walker & Sons launched their \"Hide A Case\" advertising campaign that involved enticing drinkers to seek out cases of Canadian Club that had been hidden at exotic locations throughout the world. These included Mount Kilimanjaro, Angel Falls, Mount St. Helens, and the Swiss Alps. The Mount Kilimanjaro case was not discovered until a Dutch journalist happened upon it in the mid-1970s. A small number of cases, such as one hidden above the Arctic Circle, were never found.\n\nThe first \"Hide A Case\" campaign officially ended in 1971, and a second was started in 1975. This campaign used cases hidden in locations intended to be easier to access, such as in Death Valley and on top of a skyscraper in New York City. This second advertising campaign ended in 1981; between it and the first effort, a total of 22 cases were hidden and at least 16 recovered.\n\nIn the 2007 IndyCar Series season, they were main the sponsor for Andretti Green Racing #27 driver, Dario Franchitti during their championship winning season, which also included winning the 2007 Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe \"Hide A Case\" campaign was revived in 2010. According to the contest website, there is a $100,000 grand prize, among other prizes, for the contest's latest incarnation.\n\nCanadian Club whisky comes in seven versions, and as a straight rye. All are 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume), unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Club is also produced in limited quantities in older agings (15 years and up) for special markets. For the whisky's 150th anniversary in 2008, a 30-year-old version was released in a very limited bottling.\n\nCanadian Club Premium is also blended into a ready-to-drink beverage:\n\n\nA recent line extension is the 6% ABV \"Premium Strength\", only available in 375mL cans and mixed with Dry Ginger Ale.\n\n\n"}

The name of the dish comes from the combination of the Norwegian words \"hove\" and \"smale\". \"Hove\" is a dialectal form of \"hovud\", meaning head (\"cf.\" Hǫfuð), and \"smale\" is a word for sheep, so Smalahove literally means sheep head. The skin and fleece of the head is torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled or steamed for about three hours, and is served with mashed rutabaga and potatoes. It is also traditionally served with Akvavit. In some preparations, the brain is cooked inside the skull and then eaten with a spoon or fried. Originally, \"smalahove\" was typically eaten by the poor.\n\nOne serving usually consists of one half of a head. The ear and eye are normally eaten first, as they are the fattiest areas and are best eaten warm. The head is often eaten from the front to the back, working around the bones of the skull.\n\nSince 1998 and the mad cow epidemics, an EU directive forbids the production of \"smalahove\" from adult sheep, due to fear of the possibility of transmission of scrapie, a deadly, degenerative prion disease of sheep and goats, though scrapie does not appear to be transmissible to humans. It is now only allowed to be produced from the heads of lambs.\n\n\"Smalahove\" is considered by most people to be unappealing or even repulsive. It is mostly enjoyed by enthusiasts, and is often served to tourists. Because of its status as an \"extreme\" food, tourists often seek it out as a thrill. Voss, Norway in particular has benefited from tourists wishing to try it, \"not only as a nostalgic and authentic rural dish, but also as a challenging culinary trophy appealing to thrill-seeking consumers.\"\n\n"}

Before the creation of quick bread, baked goods were leavened either with yeast or by mixing dough with eggs.\n\nThe discovery or rediscovery of chemical leavening agents and their widespread military, commercial, and home use in the United States dates back to 1846 with the introduction of commercial baking soda in New York, by Church and Dwight of \"Arm & Hammer\" fame. This development was extended in 1856 by the introduction of commercial baking powder in Massachusetts, although perhaps the best known form of baking powder is \"Calumet\", first introduced in Hammond, Indiana and West Hammond, Illinois (later Calumet City, Illinois) in 1889. Both forms of food-grade chemical leaveners are still being produced under their original names, although not within the same corporate structure.\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), the demand for portable and quickly-made food was high, while skilled labor for traditional breadmaking was scarce. This encouraged the adoption of bread which was rapidly made and leavened with baking soda, instead of yeast. The shortage of chemical leaveners in the American South during the Civil War contributed to a food crisis there.\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution accelerated, the marketing of mass-produced prepackaged foods was eased by the use of chemical leaveners, which could produce consistent products regardless of variations in source ingredients, time of year, geographical location, weather conditions, and many other factors that could cause problems with environmentally sensitive, temperamental yeast formulations. These factors were traded off against the loss of traditional yeast flavor, nutrition, and texture.\n\nPreparing a quick bread generally involves two mixing containers. One contains all dry ingredients (including chemical leavening agents or agent) and one contains all wet ingredients (possibly including liquid ingredients that are slightly acidic in order to initiate the leavening process). In some variations, the dry ingredients are in a bowl and the wet ingredients are heated sauces in a saucepan off-heat and cooled.\n\nDuring the chemical leavening process, agents (one or more food-grade chemicals—usually a weak acid and a weak base) are added into the dough during mixing. These agents undergo a chemical reaction to produce carbon dioxide, which increases the baked good's volume and produces a porous structure and lighter texture. Yeast breads often take hours to rise, and the resulting baked good's texture can vary greatly based on external factors such as temperature and humidity. By contrast, breads made with chemical leavening agents are relatively uniform, reliable, and quick. Usually, the resulting baked good is softer and lighter than a traditional yeast bread.\n\nChemical leavening agents include a weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, to create an acid–base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called \"soda bread\".) Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to form stiff peaks, as in the case of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid—base combinations include:\n\nAlmost all quick breads have the same basic ingredients: flour, leavening, eggs, fat (butter, margarine, shortening, or oil), and liquid such as milk. Ingredients beyond these basic constituents are added for variations in flavor and texture. The type of bread produced varies based predominantly on the method of mixing, the major flavoring, and the ratio of liquid in the batter. Some batters are thin enough to pour, and others thick enough to mold into lumps.\n\nThere are three basic methods for making quick breads, which may combine the \"rise\" of the chemical leavener with advantageous \"lift\" from other ingredients:\n\n\nQuick breads also vary widely in the consistency of their dough or batter. There are four main types of quick bread batter:\n\nThe above are volumetric ratios and are not based on baker's percentages or weights.\n\n\n"}

The name has remained today and Nasi Kandar's word appears in most Tamil Muslim or “Malaysian Mamak” restaurants and Indian-Muslim food stall.\n\nThe rice for a nasi kandar dish is often placed in a wooden container about three feet high, giving it a distinctive aroma. The rice is accompanied by side dishes such as fried chicken, curried beef spleen, cubed beef, lamb, fish roe, fried prawns or fried squid. The vegetable dish would usually be (brinjal or \"terong\") (aubergine), okra (lady fingers or \"bhindi\") or bitter gourd. A mixture of curry sauces is poured on the rice. This is called 'banjir' (flooding) and imparts a diverse taste to the rice.\n\nTraditionally, nasi kandar is always served with its side dishes on a single plate. Nowadays, small melamine bowls are used for the side dishes.

Other differences from football include a smaller pitch, smaller goals, a reduced game duration. Matches are played indoors, or outdoors on AstroTurf or artificial grass pitches that may be enclosed within a barrier or \"cage\" to prevent the ball from leaving the playing area and keep the game constantly flowing.\n\nThe penalty area is significantly different from football: it is semi-circular in shape, only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball within it, and he or she may or may not be allowed out.\nGoalkeepers are only allowed to give the ball out to another player through hands. The goalkeeper may only kick the ball if it is in the course of making a save.\nThere are no offside rules.\nHeaders are allowed. There is no protocol of deliberate handball versus accidental handball – the referee needs to make a decision based on the distance from where the ball was hit.\nYellow cards may result in the offending player being sent to the \"sin bin\" for a predetermined length of time. Red cards work in the same way as the 11-a-side game, the offending player being dismissed from the match.\nCharging/sliding tackles are awarded a yellow card.\n\nAdditionally, metal studded boots cannot be worn, as this would damage the playing surface. Players are also required to wear shin guards, but enforcement of this is usually at the discretion of the referee.\n\nFive-a-side is commonly played informally, and the rules are therefore flexible and are sometimes decided immediately before play begins; this is in contrast to futsal, for which official laws are published by FIFA.\n\nThe English FA have drawn up a full list of laws for the small-sided game which expands upon the rules outlined above and includes minimum/maximum pitch dimensions as well as technicalities on free-kicks and other parts of the game.\n\nFutsal is a version of indoor five-a-side football developed by the Asociación Mundial de Fútbol de Salón (AMF / English:World Futsal Association). It currently has two governing bodies: the AMF and the association football international body; the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA).\n\nIndoor soccer is an indoor variant played primarily in North America, typically with six-a-side teams on an ice hockey-sized pitch.\n\nBeach soccer is a variation on five-a-side football in that it is played on a sandy surface. Rules do not greatly differ from those found in regular five-a-side football.\nA variation with increased pitch size and number of players on a team. In this variation there are five outfield players and one goalkeeper on the pitch for each team at any one time. Rules do not greatly differ from those found in five-a-side football.\n\nThis is another variation with increased pitch and team size; in this case with six outfield players and a goalkeeper on each side. The rules generally do not differ from those from five-a-side.\n\nThis is a variation of seven-a-side football primarily played in Australia and New Zealand. The rules have been modified slightly to encourage new players to the game, with strict enforcement of non-contact and two ways to score points: by scoring a goal in the same manner as the other formats, or by scoring a board that is on either side of the goal. The boards are usually 2.5m long and one third of the height of the goal. A goal is 3 points and a board is 1 point. When the ball goes out of play, it may be kicked or thrown in. This applies to the sideline and corners.\n\nThere are many operators of five-a-side football in Europe (PowerLeague, Goals Soccer Center, ), and most of all in the UK.\n\nThe F5WC is the world's largest amateur five-a-side football tournament in the world with over 48 participating nations.\n\nIFA7 is an international association that promotes outdoor seven-a-side football. IFA7 held the first known Seven-a-side Football World Cup in 2017 in Guatemala, with Russia winning the title. \n\nThe popularity of five-a-side youth football has grown tremendously within the U.S. Many organisations have chosen this format and modified it slightly to promote an environment where children can excel early in youth sports. American Youth Soccer Organization, United States Youth Soccer Association, and Fun Fair Positive Soccer are among the largest organisations bringing this format to the regional US-based youth soccer arena.\n\nIn recent years a few five-a-side teams have found themselves with sponsorship deals amounting up to thousand of pounds contracts. Sponsors feel with the vast numbers of participation in five-a-side football rising in the UK that it is a good place to advertise and tend to sponsor competition winners or league winners at local facilities so that they know that their deals are with the best five-a-side teams around the area.\n"}

He and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think Nixon was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response.\n\nIn 1517, Niccolò Machiavelli had argued that sometimes it is \"a very wise thing to simulate madness\" (\"Discourses on Livy\", book 3, chapter 2). Although in \"Nixon's Vietnam War\", Kimball argues that Nixon arrived at the strategy independently, as a result of practical experience and observation of Dwight D. Eisenhower's handling of the Korean War.\n\nIn his 1962 book, \"Thinking About the Unthinkable\", futurist Herman Kahn argued that to \"look a little crazy\" might be an effective way to induce an adversary to stand down.\n\nNixon's Chief of Staff, H. R. Haldeman, wrote that Nixon had confided to him:\n\nI call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, \"for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button\" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\n\nIn October 1969, the Nixon administration indicated to the Soviet Union that \"the madman was loose\" when the United States military was ordered to full global war readiness alert (unbeknownst to the majority of the American population), and bombers armed with thermonuclear weapons flew patterns near the Soviet border for three consecutive days.\n\nThe administration employed the \"madman strategy\" to force the North Vietnamese government to negotiate an end to the Vietnam War. In July 1969, according to a recently-declassified CIA report, President Nixon may have suggested to South Vietnamese President Thieu that the two paths he was considering were either a nuclear weapons option or setting up a coalition government.\n\nAlong the same lines, American diplomats, especially Henry Kissinger, portrayed the 1970 incursion into Cambodia as a symptom of Nixon's supposed instability.\n\nThe theory is believed by some to be a strategy used by U.S. President Donald Trump in dealing with both allied and hostile nations. Jonathan Stevenson argues Trump's strategy may be even less effective than Nixon's because Nixon tried to give the impression that \"he'd been pushed too far, implying that he would return to his senses if the Soviets and North Vietnamese gave in.\" Whereas the North Korean government is unlikely to believe that \"Trump would do the same\" because his threats are \"standard operating procedure\", not a temporary emotional reaction.\n\nThe theory was criticized as \"ineffective and dangerous,\" by political scientist Scott Sagan and the historian Jeremi Suri, citing the belief that the Soviet leader Brezhnev did not understand what Nixon was trying to communicate and also the chance of an accident from the increased movements of U.S. forces.\nPresident Trump's use of the theory with North Korea has been similarly criticized, suggesting the chance of an accident arising from North Korea's string of missile testing was also increased.\n\n\n\n"}

Generally, they are called caramel apples when only caramel is applied and taffy apples for when there are further ingredients such as peanuts applied.\n\nFor high-volume production of caramel apples, a sheet of caramel can be wrapped around the apple, followed by heating the apple to melt the caramel evenly onto it. This creates a harder caramel that is easier to transport but more difficult to eat. Caramel apple production at home usually involves melting pre-purchased caramel candies for dipping or making a homemade caramel from ingredients like corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla. Homemade caramel generally results in a softer, creamier coating.\n\nIn recent years, it has become increasingly popular to decorate caramel apples for holidays like Halloween. Methods used to do this include applying sugar or salt to softened caramel, dipping cooled, hardened apples in white or milk chocolate, or painting designs onto finished caramel apples with white chocolate colored with food coloring.\n\nClassically, the preferred apples for use in caramel apples are tart, crisp apples such as Granny Smith or Fuji apples. Softer, grainy-textured apples can also be used, but are not preferred.\n\nIn addition to caramel apples, manufacturers and consumers have started to coat apples in chocolate syrup, peanut butter, etc. and adding toppings such as crushed peanuts, pretzels, mini M&Ms, Reese's Pieces, coconut flakes, and mini chocolate chips. Candy apple shops and candy apple bars have started to pop up in bigger cities, at weddings and parties to allow people to enjoy the apple with the dipping sauces and toppings they prefer.\n\n"}

It is spelt \"Maß\" or \"Mass\" (both spellings are allowed) in Germany and Austria, \"Mass\" in Switzerland. The plural is also \"\".\n\nA stoneware mug is a form of beer stein, another type of vessel which may only be referred to as a Maß if capable of holding a regulation quantity of beer.\n\nIn the Southern German areas (Austro-Bavarian), the \"Maß\" originally measured 1.069 litres, equivalent to 2.259 US or 1.881 UK pints. Other German speaking areas had different measures: in Switzerland between 1838 and 1877 and in Baden until 1871 the \"Maß\" was 1.5 litres.\n\nThe modern Maßkrug is slightly larger than 1 litre, with a \"\" (calibration mark) denoting the level to which the beer must be filled to allow room for its head to expand. Using mugs without a calibration mark, or with a mark that is below the true 1 litre position, is also prosecuted as fraud. A \"Coalition against fraudulent pouring [of beer]\" (\"\"Verein gegen betrügerisches Einschenken\"\") in Munich fights for the customer rights of beer drinkers, and is mostly active on the Oktoberfest.\n\nIn the more northerly parts of Germany, the Maß has mostly fallen out of use, except for Bavarian-themed events, since beer for immediate consumption there is usually sold in smaller amounts, between ,\n\nMugs are frequently decorated with a print of the sign of the brewery.\n\nSome beer gardens and restaurants rent space out to patrons to store their mugs, which often have personalized engravings on their lids.

The mass of 1.3 kilograms can produce a force of 8500 newtons in a violent blow, far surpassing the 4000 newtons required to break a human's skullcap. However, there were cases in which the Maßkrug yielded. Presumably, these mugs had reduced strength due to wear.\n\n"}

It comes in many forms, including vanilla, lemon, lime, peanut butter, banana, coconut, and chocolate. One feature of almost all cream pies is a whipped cream topping. The custard filling is related to crème patissière, a key component of French cakes and tarts. It is a one-crust pie, meaning the crust covers the bottoms and sides but not the top. The crust may be a standard pie crust made with flour and lard, butter, or shortening; or it may be made from crumbled cookies or graham crackers.\n\nCream pies are often associated with comedians who use them as a gimmick in their routines, with the pie being pushed against someone's face. When used for show business purposes, cream pies are generally mock-up pies made from only canned whipped cream or sometimes the less expensive shaving cream. Pieing is the act of throwing a pie at a person or people. This can be a political action when the target is an authority figure, politician, or celebrity and can be used as a means of protesting against the target's political beliefs, or against perceived arrogance or vanity. Perpetrators generally regard the act as a form of ridicule to embarrass and humiliate the victim.

Frequently, the cake is covered with icing, but sometimes, the sides are left undecorated, so that the filling and the number of layers are visible.\n\nPopular flavor combinations include the German chocolate cake, red velvet cake, Black Forest cake, and carrot cake with cream cheese icing. Many wedding cakes are decorated layer cakes.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, modern cakes were first described in English. Maria Parloa's \"Appledore Cook Book\", published in Boston in 1872, contained one of the first layer cake recipes. Another early recipe for layer cake was published in \"Cassell's New Universal Cookery Book\", published in London in 1894.\n\nAn older form of layer cake is common in southern and eastern Europe. In Ukraine and Russia, people still make these cakes in the old traditional way. The cake batter is baked in a frying pan in thin layers, about a centimeter thick in the finished stack. These layers are then covered with a thin layer of cream and/or jam and stacked 7 or 8 layers high. This stack, which is the same height as the typical Western layer cake, is then frosted so that the structure is not visible. At first glance, these cakes look much like a German konditorei style cake such as the Black Forest cake.\n\nLayer cakes typically serve multiple people, so they are larger than cupcakes, petit fours, or other individual pastries. A common layer cake size, which is baked in nine-inch round cake pans, typically serves about 16 people.\n\nUnlike the Vietnamese Bánh da lợn or Swiss rolls, layer cake is assembled from several separate pieces of cake.

It developed into a formal, dignitary title, derived from the \"Companions\" of Alexander the Great and rather equivalent to the Hellenistic title of \"\"philos basilikos\"\" or the paladin title of a knight of the Holy Roman Empire and a Papal Palatinus. Thus the title was retained when the titulary was appointed, often promoted, to an office away from court, frequently in the field or a provincial administration. Subsequently, it was thought logical to connect the title to specific offices that demanded an incumbent official of high dignity, and even to include it as part of the official title.\n\nAs the Imperial Roman \"Curia\" increased in number and assimilated all political power, the Roman Emperors instituted a casual practice of appointing faithful servants to offices. This had been done elsewhere, e. g. regarding the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard and the \"amici principis\". As Imperial administration expanded, however, new offices became necessary and decentralization demanded modifications. The result was the institution of the rank of \"\"comes\"\".\n\nThe \"\"comites\"\", often translated \"counts\", though they were neither feudal nor hereditary, became principal officials of the later Roman Empire. They held offices of all kinds from the army to the civil service, while retaining their direct accesses to the Emperor. Emperor Constantine I finalized them as the governmental echelon of \"\"comites provinciarum\"\" (\"Counts of the Provinces\"); the \"comites\" of the new echelon were assigned alongside the \"vicarii\" in the civil dioceses of the latter so that the \"comites\" became permanent fixtures of Imperial government. The \"comites\" were fully enumerated as early as the beginning of the AD 5th century in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\", but as offices were later added, it is not historically exhaustive.\n\nThe following sections describe examples of the kinds of \"comites\".\n\nSeveral of the major departments of the Imperial \"Curia\" (\"Court\") and household had a principal official who was styled \"\"comes\"\" and assisted by an \"\"officium\"\" (\"staff\") very similar to that of a Roman governor. They included:\n\nExceptionally, a gubernatorial position was styled \"\"comes\"\". For example, the \"comes Orientis\", actually one of the \"vicarii\", was an official who controlled the large and strategically important Imperial Diocese of the East by supervising the governors of this collection of provinces, but he was in turn supervised by the \"praefectus praetorio Orientis\".\n\nFurther, the principal officials of some less important governmental departments who were under the authority of otherwise styled, high ranking, territorial officials could be titled \"\"comes\"\", e. g. under the \"praefectus urbi\" of Rome, himself a \"vir illustris\", was a \"comes formarum\", \"comes riparum et alvei Tiberis et Cloacarum\" (\"Count of the Coast of the Tiber and the Canalisation\"), and \"comes Portus\" (\"Count of the Port\").\n\nThe title \"\"comes consistorianus\"\" or \"\"comes consistorialis\"\" indicated specially appointed members to the \"consistorium\", the council of the Roman emperor's closest advisors.\n\nThe \"comes rei militaris\" held martial appointments, ranking superior to a \"dux\" but inferior to the \"magister peditum\" and \"magister equitum\"; they were the superiors of a series of military stations, each commanded by a \"praepositus limitis\" (\"border commander\") and/or unit commanders, e. g., tribunes of cohorts, \"alae\" (auxiliary equivalents), \"numeri\", and in the Eastern Empire even legions.\nThe \"Notitia Dignitatum\" of the early AD 5th century enumerates 6 such offices, being of the dignity of \"vir spectabilis\", in the Western Empire: \"comes Italiae\", \"comes Africae\", \"comes Tingitaniae\", \"comes Tractus Argentoratensis\", and \"comes Britanniarum ad Litoris Saxonici per Britanniam\"; and 2 in the Eastern Empire: \"comes (limitis) Aegypti\" and \"comes Isauriae\".\n\nAs the number of \"comites\" increased, that dignity was devalued. This caused the introduction of classes of \"comites\", denominated and ranked the first, second, and third \"\"ordines\"\".\n\nThe \"comites dominorum nostrorum\" (plural of \"Comes D. N.\", literally \"Companions of Our Lords ([Emperors])\") were a mounted Imperial bodyguard during the tetrarchy of Emperor Diocletian in circa AD 300.\n\nThe Goths that ruled Spain and Italy followed the Roman tradition of granting the title of \"\"Comes\"\" to the various principals of the departments of their royal households, including but not limited to the: \n\nThe Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty retained much of Roman administration, including the office and title of \"\"comes\"\", the original meaning of which they preserved, i. e., a companion of the king and a royal servant of high dignity. Under the early Frankish kings some \"comites\" did not have definite functions: they were merely attached to the person of the King and executed his orders. Others filled the highest offices, e. g. the \"Comes Palatii\" and \"Comes Stabuli\" (from which the contemporary title of \"constable\" derives). \n\nYet other \"comites\" served as regional officials. For administrative purposes, the Kingdom of the Franks was divided into small districts denominated \"\"pagi\"\" (hence the French \"\"pays\"\" and the German \"\"Gaue\"\"), corresponding generally to the Roman \"civitas\" (\"city\" \"qua\" polity). The principal of a \"pagus\" was the \"Comes\", corresponding to the German \"Graf\" (in full, \"\"Gaugraf\"\"). The King appointed the \"Comites\" to serve at his pleasure, and they were originally chosen from all classes, sometimes even from enfranchised serfs.\n\nThe essential competences of the \"Comes\"' were comprehensive in his \"pagus\": martial, judicial, and executive; and in documents he is often described as the \"\"agens publicus\"\" (\"public agent\") of the King or \"\"judex publicus/fiscalis\"\" (\"royal judge\"). He was at once public prosecutor and judge, and was responsible for the execution of the sentences as well. As the delegate of the executive power, he had the right to exercise the \"\"bannis regis\"\" (\"royal ban\"), which gave him the right to command his military in the name of the King and to act as necessary to preserve the peace. As the King's representative, he exercised the royal right of protection (\"\"mundium regis\"\") of churches, widows, orphans, and the like. He enjoyed a triple \"\"wergeld\"\", but had no definite salary, being remunerated by receipt of specific revenues, which system contained the germs of discord, on account of the confusion of his public and private obligations.\n\nAccording to philologists, the Anglo-Saxon word \"\"gerefa\"\", denoting \"illustrious chief\", however, is not connected to the German \"\"Graf\"\", which originally meant \"servant\"; compare the etymologies of the words \"knight\" and \"valet\". It is the more curious that the \"\"gerefa\"\" should end as a subservient \"reeve\" while the \"\"graf\"\" became a noble count.\n\nIn the feudal tradition, Latin was, especially in law, the official language, and therefore the rendering in Latin was equal in importance to the vernacular title.

The three basic steps of parboiling are soaking, steaming and drying. These steps also make rice easier to process by hand, boost its nutritional profile and change its texture. About 50% of the world’s paddy production is parboiled. The treatment is practiced in many parts of the world such as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Guinea, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Nigeria, Thailand, Switzerland, USA and France.\n\nRice is easier to polish by hand (removal of the bran layer) after parboiling but mechanical processing is harder since the bran becomes somewhat oily and tends to clog machinery. Most parboiled rice is milled in the same way as white rice.\n\nParboiling drives nutrients, especially thiamin, from the bran to the endosperm, hence parboiled white rice is 80% nutritionally similar to brown rice. Because of this, parboiling was adopted by North American rice growers in the early 20th century.\n\nThe starches in parboiled rice become gelatinized, then retrograded after cooling. Through gelatinization, amylose molecules leach out of the starch granule network and diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium outside the granules which, when fully hydrated are at maximum viscosity. The parboiled rice kernels should be translucent when wholly gelatinized. Cooling brings retrogradation whereby amylose molecules re-associate with each other and form a tightly packed structure. This increases the formation of type 3-resistant starch which can act as a prebiotic and benefit good health in humans. However, this also makes the kernels harder and glassier. Parboiled rice takes less time to cook and is firmer and less sticky. In North America parboiled rice is either partially or fully precooked before sale. Minerals such as zinc or iron are added, increasing their potential bioavailability in the diet.\n\nIn older methods, clean paddy rice was soaked in cold water for 36–38 hours to give it a moisture content of 30–35%, after which the rice was put in parboiling equipment with fresh cold water and boiled until it began to split. The rice was then dried on woven mats, cooled and milled.\n\nIn the 1910s German-British scientist Erich Gustav Huzenlaub (1899–1964) and the British scientist and chemist Francis Heron Rogers invented a form of parboiling which held more of the nutrients in rice, now known as the Huzenlaub Process. The whole grain is vacuum dried, then steamed, followed by another vacuum drying and husking. This also makes the rice more resistant to weevils and lessens cooking time.\n\nIn even later methods the rice is soaked in hot water, then steamed for boiling which only takes 3 hours rather than the 20 hours of traditional methods. These methods also yield a yellowish color in the rice, which undergoes less breakage when milled.\n\n"}

They are often manufactured as teardrop-shaped volumes with flat circular bases; another variety of chocolate chips have the shape of rectangular or square blocks. They are available in various sizes, usually less than in diameter.\n\nChocolate chips were created with the invention of chocolate chip cookies in 1937 when Ruth Graves Wakefield of the Toll House Inn in the town of Whitman, Massachusetts added cut-up chunks of a semi-sweet Nestlé chocolate bar to a cookie recipe. (The Nestlé brand \"Toll House cookies\" is named for the inn.) The cookies were a huge success, and Wakefield reached an agreement in 1939 with Nestlé to add her recipe to the chocolate bar's packaging in exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate. Initially, Nestlé included a small chopping tool with the chocolate bars. In 1941, Nestlé and at least one of its competitors started selling the chocolate in \"chip\" (or \"morsel\") form.\n\nOriginally, chocolate chips were made of semi-sweet chocolate, but today there are many flavors. These include bittersweet, peanut butter, butterscotch, mint chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white and dark swirled chips.\n\nChocolate chips can be used in cookies, pancakes, waffles, cakes, pudding, muffins, crêpes, pies, hot chocolate, and various pastries. They are also found in many other retail food products such as granola bars, ice cream, and trail mix.\n\nChocolate chips can also be melted and used in sauces and other recipes. The chips melt best at temperatures between . The melting process starts at , when the cocoa butter starts melting in the chips. The cooking temperature must never exceed for milk chocolate and white chocolate, or for dark chocolate, or the chocolate will burn.\n\nAlthough convenient, melted chocolate chips are not always recommended as a substitute for baking chocolate. Because most chocolate chips are designed to retain their shape when baking, they contain less cocoa butter than baking chocolate, and so can be more difficult to work with melted.\nChocolate chips are popular as a baking ingredient in the United States. Originating in the US, the chocolate chip cookie is widely available many parts of the world. Nestlé and the Hershey Company are among the top producers of chocolate chips.\n"}

Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest. As the Super Bowl itself is typically the most-watched event on television in the United States annually, the halftime show has been equally-viewed in recent years: the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIX featuring Katy Perry was viewed by 118.5 million, as part of an overall telecast that peaked at 120.3 million at its conclusion—the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history. The NFL announced that the Super Bowl LI halftime show, with Lady Gaga was the \"most-watched musical event of all-time,\" citing a figure of 150 million viewers based on the television audience, as well as unique viewership of video postings of the halftime show on the league's platforms, and social media interactions (a metric that was never calculated prior to 2017). The show was seen by 117.5 million television viewers, making it the second-highest-rated halftime show on network broadcast.\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the Grambling State University Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), drill teams, and other performance ensembles such as Up with People. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature pop music acts such as New Kids on the Block and Gloria Estefan. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, Super Bowl XXVII featured a headlining performance by Michael Jackson. After Super Bowl XXXVIII, whose halftime show featured an incident where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts, the halftime show began to feature classic rock acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in 2011.\n\nDuring most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game, saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Michael Jackson, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme—begun with Super Bowl III—ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows. Since Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.\n\nThe NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends. Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the \"Wall Street Journal\" that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the \"Journal\", received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.\n\nThe following is a list of the performers, producers, themes, and sponsors for each Super Bowl game's show.\n\nU2 performed 3 songs: \"Beautiful Day,\" \"MLK,\" and \"Where the Streets Have No Name.\" During the beginning of \"MLK\" and continuing until the end of \"Where The Streets Have No Name,\" a large banner behind the band displayed the names of all the people who lost their lives on the September 11 attacks. Bono ended the song by opening up his jacket, the inside of which displayed the American flag.\n\nFor The Rolling Stones, the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo (John Pasche's \"Cunning Linguist\" first used in 1971 on their \"Sticky Fingers\" album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: \"Start Me Up,\" \"Rough Justice,\" and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.\" The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined. In the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off Mick Jagger's microphone—censoring to which the group had previously agreed.\nHowever, the choice of The Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the traditional Detroit \"Motown Sound,\" and no artists from the area were included.\n"}

After reciting the blessings, and eating a matzah \"Hillel sandwich\"(with two matzot) combining charoset and maror, the remainder is often eaten plain, spread on matzah.\n\nCharoset is mentioned in the Mishna in connection with the items placed on the Passover table: \"unleavened bread and lettuce and charoset.\" Some say it can be traced back to the custom of symposia in ancient Greece, where philosophical discussions were accompanied by drinking large quantities of wine and consuming foods dipped into mixtures of pounded nuts and spices.\n\nThere are many recipes for charoset.

They then put vinegar thereto, and add spices. Some there are who put ground sesame seeds into this admixture. On the night of the Passover, a person is required to put therein whole spices that have not been ground; either two or three seeds of valerian (Arabic: \"sunbul\"), or sprigs of marjoram [alternatively: wild thyme ] (Arabic: \"za'tar\"), or savory (Arabic: \"hasha\"), or things similar to them, so that it will resemble straw in mortar – in remembrance of that thing by which our fathers were enslaved in Egypt, seeing that it is like unto bricks and straw.\" In Yemenite Jewish tradition, the charoset is also called \"dukeh\" (), a name also referred to as such in the Jerusalem Talmud.\n\nNot all Jews use the term \"charoset\". Some of the Jews of the Middle East instead use the term \"\"halegh\"\". The origin of \"halegh\" is not clear. Rav Saadia Gaon uses the word and attributes it to a kind of walnut that was a mandatory ingredient in the preparation of the halegh.\n\nParts of the Jewish Diaspora in Iran have a tradition of including forty different ingredients in the halegh. The number forty signifies the forty years of wandering in the desert.\n\nIn 2015 Ben & Jerry's Charoset ice cream became widely available in Israel and was covered in several major news outlets.\n\n"}

It was introduced in 1994.\n\nSteel Reserve is sold in bottles. It also is distributed in cans, bottles, cans in packs of four or six, and cans in packs of six or twelve. In 2016 the company replaced its 40 oz. narrow-neck glass bottles with wide-neck, shatterproof plastic bottles.\n\nThe 40-ounce, 8.1% ABV variety is widely available throughout the US; however, some states require the beverage to be sold as a diluted 6.0% ABV and in Utah 3.2% ABW within accordance of state law. \n\nIn 2016 a new lineup of fruit flavored 8.0% ABV 16 fl. oz. cans was introduced in the United States. Flavors include: BLK Berry, Hard Pineapple, Spiked Punch, Spiked Razz, and Spiked Watermelon.\n\nIn 2012, Steel Reserve 8.1% ABV received the Gold medal in the category of 'American-Style Premium Lager or Specialty Lager' at the World Beer Cup. Additionally, the american malt liquor style ale has been rated within the 83 percentile earning the \"good\" rating by Beeradvocate. While users of the site have accumulated a rating of 60 - \"poor\" (2017). Alternatively, Ratebeer has given an accumulative rating of \"0\" overall and \"10\" for overall style.\n\nAnheuser-Busch also adopted the \"High Gravity\" nomenclature, referring to the term specific gravity, a measurement used to quantify the sugars available to produce alcohol in a fermented beverage, which may give an indication of alcohol content, and released Hurricane High Gravity Lager with the same alcohol content, container sizes, and similar price.\n\nReverend Horton Heat and the Ramones were commissioned to release several radio jingles for the beverage in the 1990s.\n\n"}

Before refrigeration, canning and other modern preservation techniques became available, fermenting was an important preservation method. Fish rapidly spoils, or goes rotten, unless some method is applied to stop the bacteria that produce the spoilage. Fermentation is a method which attacks the ability of microbials to spoil fish. It does this by making the fish muscle more acidic; bacteria usually cease multiplying when the pH drops below 4.5.\n\nA modern approach, biopreservation, adds lactic acid bacteria to the fish to be fermented. This produces active antimicrobials such as lactic and acetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and peptide bacteriocins. It can also produce the antimicrobial nisin, a particularly effective preservative.\n\nFermented fish preparations can be notable for their putrid smell. These days there are many other techniques of preserving fish, but fish is still fermented because some people enjoy the taste.\n\nAlaska has witnessed a steady increase of cases of botulism since 1985. It has more cases of botulism than any other state in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional Eskimo practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, walrus, sea lion, and whale flippers, beaver tails, seal oil, birds, etc., to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a plastic container is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the botulinum bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic.\n\nFermented fish are highly popular in Northeast states of India and Bangladesh. There are several products traditionally prepared in the region viz. Shidal or seedal (in Bengali) prepared from small carp (\"Puntius spp\".) is a product of Assam and Tripura (in kokborok \"Berma\"). After applying oil on the fishes, they are put into the earthen pots for about 6 months and the final product is solid with sticky surface and strong pungent smell. It is eaten after elaborate cooking and prepared dishes like vegetable mix curry or chutney, and eaten as condiment with rice or chapati. Other products are tungtap of Meghalaya, Ngari of Manipur and numsing of Assam. They are also similar products.\n\n"}

Many Italian versions include a pastry crust, some include béchamel. The word \"pasticcio\" comes from the vulgar Latin word \"pastīcium\" derived from \"pasta\", and means \"pie\", and has developed the figurative meanings of \"a mess\", \"a tough situation\", or a \"pastiche\".\n\nThe typical Greek version has a bottom layer that is bucatini or other tubular pasta, with cheese and/or egg as a binder; a middle layer of ground beef, or a mix of ground beef and ground pork (or just ground pork because it is cheaper) with tomato sauce, cinnamon and cloves. Other spices like nutmeg or allspice are used in the top layer that is a flour-based béchamel or a béchamel with cheese (known as mornay sauce in France). Grated goat cheese is often sprinkled on top. Pastitsio is a common dish, and is often served as a main course, with a salad.\n\nIn Cyprus a similar dish is called \"oven macaroni\" (Greek: μακαρόνια του φούρνου, \"makarónia tou foúrnou\", Turkish: fırında makarna). It is an essential dish during weddings and celebrations such as Easter, where it is served along with spit roasted meat. Recipes vary, but usually the meat sauce in the middle is made of pork, beef or lamb, tomatoes are only sometimes used, and it is flavoured with mint, parsley or cinnamon. The top is sprinkled with grated halloumi or anari cheese, though cheese is sometimes added only to the white sauce.\n\nThere is also a Turkish Cypriot version of this recipe (Turkish: bol peynirli makarna fırında) that substitutes the meat with 2 types of cheese (kaşar peyniri and beyaz peyniri).\n\nMacarona béchamel ( ) is the Egyptian version, which is an imitation of the French version. It is typically made with penne pasta, a layer of cooked spiced meat with onions, and béchamel or mornay sauce. A widely contested version is made by adding tomato sauce to one or more of the components of this dish.\n\nIn Malta, \"timpana\" (the name probably derived from \"timballo\") is made by tossing parboiled macaroni in a tomato sauce containing a small amount of minced beef or corned beef, bound with a mixture of raw egg and grated cheese. Hard-boiled eggs are sometimes added. The macaroni is then enclosed in a pastry case or lid before being baked.\n\n"}

Items like bricks could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. <nowiki>citation needed</nowiki> Highly durable goods such as refrigerators or cars usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use, so durable goods are typically characterized by long periods between successive purchases.\n\nExamples of consumer durable goods include automobiles, books, household goods (home appliances, consumer electronics, furniture, tools, etc.), sports equipment, jewelry, medical equipment, firearms, and toys.\n\nNondurable goods or soft goods (consumables) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.\n\nExamples of nondurable goods include fast-moving consumer goods such as cosmetics and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.\n\nWhile durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.\n\nAccording to Cooper (1994, p5) \"\"durability is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair\"\". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.\n\nThe life span of household goods is significant for sustainable consumption. The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption. Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.\n\nDurability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[5].\n\n"}

{"id": "1751119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1751119", "title": "Final good", "text": "Final good\n\nA consumer good or final good is any commodity that is produced or consumed by the consumer to satisfy current wants or needs. Consumer goods are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a microwave oven or a bicycle that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are intermediate goods. For example, textiles or transistors can be used to make some further goods.\n\nWhen used in measures of national income and output, the term \"final goods\" includes only new goods. For instance, the GDP excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent double counting of production that is based on resales of the same item. In that context, the economic definition of goods includes what are commonly known as \"services\".\n\"Manufactured goods\" are goods that have been processed in any way. As such, they are the opposite of raw materials, but they include intermediate goods as well as final goods.\n\nThere are legal definitions. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an extensive definition of consumer product, which begins:\nCONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—\n(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,\nIt then goes on to list eight additional specific exclusions and further details.\n\nFinal goods can be classified into the following categories:\n\nConsumer durable goods usually have a significant lifespan, which tends to be at least one year, based on the guarantee or warranty period. The maximum life depends upon the durability of the product or good. On the other hand, capital goods, which are tangible in nature, such as machinery or building or any other equipment that can be used in manufacturing of final product, are durable goods with limited lifespans that are determined by manufacturers before their sale. The longevity and the often-higher cost of durable goods usually cause consumers to postpone expenditures on them, which makes durables the most volatile (or cost-dependent) component of consumption.\n\nConsumer nondurable goods are purchased for immediate use or for use very soon. Generally, the lifespan of nondurable goods is from a few minutes to up to three years: food, beverages, clothing, shoes and gasoline are examples.\n\nConsumer services are the intangible in nature. They cannot be seen, felt or tasted by the consumer but still give satisfaction to the consumer. They are also inseparable and variable in nature: they are thus produced and consumed simultaneously. Examples are haircuts, auto repairs and landscaping.\n\nFinal goods can be classified into the following categories, which are determined by the consumer's buying habits:\n\nConvenience goods are regularly consumed and easily available. Generally, convenience goods come in the category of nondurable goods such as fast foods, cigarettes and tobacco with low value. Convenience goods are sold mostly by wholesalers or retailers to make them available to the consumers in good or large volume. Convenience goods can further be divided into staple convenience consumer goods and impulse convenience consumer goods.\n\nStaple convenience consumer goods are the basic necessities of the consumer. These goods are easily available and in large quantity: milk, bread, sugar, etc.\n\nImpulse convenience consumer goods do not belong to the priority list of the consumer. They are purchased without any prior planning, just on the basis of the impulse: potato wafers, candies, ice creams, cold drinks, etc.\n\nShopping consumer goods are the goods which take lot of time and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. Shopping goods are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.\n\nExamples include clothing items, televisions, radios, footwear, home furnishings, etc.\n\nSpecialty goods are unique in nature; these are unusual and luxurious items available in the market. Specialty goods are mostly purchased by the upper class of the society as they are expensive in nature and difficult to be afforded by middle or lower-class people. Companies advertise their goods targeting the upper class. These goods do not fall under the category of necessity; rather they are purchased on the basis personal preference or desire. Brand name, uniqueness, and special features of an item are major attributes which attract customers and make them buy such products.\n\nExamples include antiques, jewelry, wedding dresses, cars, etc.\n\nUnsought goods neither belong to the necessity group of consumer goods list nor to specialty goods. They are always available in the market but are purchased by very few consumers, either based on their interest or their need for some specific reasons. The general public does not purchase such goods often.\n\nExamples include snowshoes, fire extinguishers, flood insurance, etc.\n\nIn the consumer product sector, there have been 107,891 deals announced between 1985 and 2018, which cumulates to a total value of around US$5,835 billion. 2007 was the year with the largest value (US$4,888 billion) followed by a steep slump in 2009 (-70.9%). After the first wave in 2007, now is the second big M&A wave in the consumer products sector, and a decline is expected.\n\n"}

The pastry is called kifli in Hungarian, \"rohlík\" in Czech, \"Kipferl\" in Austrian German, \"kifla\" in Serbo-Croatian, \"rogliček\" in Slovene, \"corn\" in Romanian, рогалик/\"rogalik\" in Russian, рогалик/\"rohalyk\" in Ukrainian, \"кифла\" in Bulgarian, \"кифла\" in Macedonian, \"rožok\" in Slovak and \"rogal\" in Polish. In Danish and Swedish, it is called \"giffel\".\n\nKifli are made by cutting sheets of soft yeast dough into triangular wedges then rolling them into crescent shapes which are then baked. Kifli differs from the French croissant (again meaning \"crescent\") in that it is made from a plain, bread-like dough (thus being more akin to a roll than to pastry) and being both thinner and longer. They may also come in different sizes, some of them equalling in weight a small bread loaf.\n\nWhen they come out of the oven, the rolls can be left plain or given a water brushing to make them shiny, or can be given an egg wash and sprinkled with either poppy seeds or caraway fruits mixed with coarse salt. The latter variety is often made into a straight shape, instead of curved like a crescent. Kifli is eaten like bread or rolls, usually made into a sandwich, sometimes plain or with butter like a fresh baguette. Often, especially for breakfast, the topping is jam or honey, or they may be used for dunking.\n\nThis is the same as the regular style, but the dough may contain butter or other shortening and/or milk. It is sweeter than the regular variety and is therefore especially well suited to be eaten with jam or honey, as is often done for breakfast with coffee, hot chocolate or milk. This might also be an accompaniment for drinks like Doogh or Kumis.\n\nThere are a couple of sweet rolls that carry the name \"kifli\" to describe their shape but they are eaten at the end of a meal or with an afternoon tea or coffee and have nothing to do with kifli which, if the word is used on its own, always means the regular or fine varieties described above.\n\n\nThe Kipferl has been documented in Austria going back at least as far as the 13th century (first recorded as \"chipfen\").\n\nA common culinary myth claims that when Christian forces freed Buda from Ottoman occupation in 1683 the bakers of the town celebrated the victory the next day by selling freshly baked bread rolls made into a crescent shape. Another culinary legend claims that the Kipferl was invented in Vienna after or during the siege of the city by the Ottoman Turks.\n\nSome in the Arab world hold to an alternate Muslim origin story for the kipferl. In this account, the croissant is thought to originate from the feteer meshaltet, a flaky, layered pastry known to the Egyptians since the Eighteenth Dynasty (c.1292 BC or earlier). During the Mamluk period (1250–1517 AD), a crescent-shaped variant of feteer meshaltet called \"feteer halali\" (crescent feteer) emerged and spread to Europe and France, where it became known as the croissant.\n\nAn early 1990s Hungarian pop group, Kifli, was named after this bakery specialty.\n\n"}

It is usually consumed by the ethnic Malays in Maritime Southeast Asia, notably in Indonesia and Malaysia. Tempoyak is made by taking the flesh of durian and mixing it with some salt and kept in room temperature for three or five days for fermentation. Tempoyaks are usually made during the durian season, when the abundance of durian and excess production are made into fermented tempoyak.\n\nTempoyak is not normally consumed solely, it is usually eaten as condiment or as an ingredient for cooking; such as cooked with coconut milk curry as \"gulai tempoyak ikan patin\" (pangasius fish tempoyak curry), or mixed with spicy chili pepper as \"sambal tempoyak\".\n\nIn the Malay archipelago, fermented durian is known by many names. It is commonly known as \"tempoyak\" in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Southern Sumatra region (South Sumatra, Jambi, Bengkulu and Lampung provinces). It is known as \"pekasam\" in Aceh and \"asam durian\" in the Minangkabau region of West Sumatra. The word \"asam\" which translates to \"sour\" describes its fermentation process. \n\nTempoyak is made by taking the flesh of durian and mixing it with salt. It is kept at room temperature and left to ferment for three to five days. As a fermented food, the tempoyak-making process involves a number of different lactic acid bacteria. Isolated lactic acid bacteria which form colonies in fermented durian are \"Lactobacillus casei\" and \"Lactobacillus rhamnosus subsp. fersantum\". These lactic acid bacteria inhibit the growth of harmful decomposing bacteria, such as \"Escherichia coli\", which in turn preserves the durian flesh. Besides its functions as a food preservative, fermented tempoyak also serves as a natural food flavoring. The addition of tempoyak into chili paste and curry can add a distinct aroma and savoury flavour to the dish.\n\nJust like many fermented food products in the region (e.g. \"belacan\", \"tempeh\", \"oncom\", \"tapai\"), tempoyak was probably discovered unintentionally; from the excessive unconsumed durian and thus left fermented, during the abundance of durian season in the region.\n\nTempoyak is mentioned in Hikayat Abdullah as a staple food for the people of Terengganu. When Abdullah Abdul Kadir visit Terengganu around the year 1836, he said that one of the favorite food of the local resident is Tempoyak. Based on Hikayat Abdullah, tempoyak is a food special to the ethnic Malays, which is the Malay in Malaysia and Indonesia which is in Sumatera and Kalimantan.\n\nIn Indonesia, tempoyak is especially popular in Palembang, and also in other cities in Sumatera such as Jambi, Bengkulu, Lampung and also Pontianak in Kalimantan. \n\nIn Palembang the dish \"tempoyak ikan patin\" (\"Pangasius\" catfish in tempoyak sauce) and \"brengkes (pepes) tempoyak\" are well known, which is a steamed fermented durian paste in banana leaf container, usually mixed with \"patin\" (\"Pangasius\" fish) as \"brengkes ikan patin tempoyak\". A spicy condiment called \"sambal tempoyak\" is made from the mixture of fermented durian, ground \"belacan\" (shrimp paste) and chili pepper.\nIn Lampung, tempoyak is made as \"sambal seruit tempoyak\". \"Seruit\" is shredded fried freshwater fishes, such as \"patin\" (\"Pangasius\"), \"baung\" (\"Hemibagrus\"), \"lais\" (\"Kryptopterus\"), \"belida\" (featherback) or \"mas\" (carp), mixed with ground chili pepper, tomato, shallot, shrimp paste, lime juice, young unripe mango, salt and tempoyak. \n\nIn Pontianak, tempoyak is usually served as spicy condiment, mixed with red chili pepper, fresh shrimp or \"teri\" (anchovy) and \"petai\" (green stinky bean).\n\nIn Malaysia, tempoyak is specifically popular in the state of Pahang and Perak, yet it is also can be found elsewhere, from Kuala Lumpur to Sarawak. In Malaysia, tempoyak is an essential ingredient for \"gulai tempoyak ikan patin\" (pangasius fish tempoyak curry) and for cooking soup with \"tang hoon\" or glass noodles.. In Sarawak, tempoyak is available in the marketplace. The taste is said to be sour and salty with a lot of nutty, durian flavours.\n\n"}
{"id": "1754718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1754718", "title": "Barzakh", "text": "Barzakh\n\nBarzakh (Arabic: برزخ, from Persian \"barzakh\", \"barrier, partition\" is an Arabic word meaning \"obstacle\", \"hindrance\", \"separation\", or \"barrier\") designates a place between hell and heaven, where the soul resides after death, and experiences its own heaven or hell, until the resurrection on \"Qiyamah\" (Judgement Day).\n\nIn Islamic eschatology, although largely up to interpretation, \"al-Barzakh\" is generally viewed as the barrier between the physical and spiritual worlds. Barzakh may, according to Ghazali, also be the place for those, who go neither to hell or to heaven, resembling the Christian concept of limbo.\n\nThe Arabic word \"barzakh\" is derived from the Persian \"barzakh\", \"barrier, partition\", which is in its turn traced back to the combination \"bar+zax(v)\" (\"high existence\"), similar to the Persian word for hell, \"dūzakh\" < \"dūžax(v)\" (\"evil existence\").\n\nMentioned only three times in the Quran, and just once specifically as the barrier between the corporeal and ethereal, Barzakh is portrayed as a place in which, after death, the spirit is separated from the body – freed to contemplate the wrongdoing of its former life. Despite the gain of recognizance, it cannot utilize action. The other two occurrences refer to Barzakh as an impenetrable barrier between fresh and salt water. While fresh and salt water may intermingle, an ocean remains distinct from a river.\n\nIn hadith, Ibn al-Qayyim cites that, albeit not mentioned in the Quran, souls in Al-Barzakh would be grouped with others matching in purity or impurity.\n\nIn Islam, the soul and the body are independent of each other. This is significant in Barzakh, because only a person's soul goes to Barzakh and not their physical body. Since one's soul is divorced from their body in Barzakh, the belief is that no progress or improvements to one's past life can be made. If a person experienced a life of sin and worldly pleasures, one cannot try to perform good deeds in order to reach \"Jannah\". Whatever one does in his or her lifetime is final and cannot be changed or altered in Barzakh.\n\nThe idea of purgatory is that it is a place where people go after death that holds punishment and purification for those who are not fit to enter Paradise just yet. People who are in this place do not have enough sins to warrant their entrance into Hell, but they do not have enough good deeds to go to Paradise. This is a temporary place, similar to barzakh. Because they have this in common, some believe that they are the same idea or concept. Barzakh is actually closer to the idea of limbo, a place that is between life and the true afterlife. In this place, people await their final judgment, much like in barzakh. The Quranic idea of aʿrāf (“the heights”) is closer to that of Christian purgatory. Aʿrāf is also thought of as a place where souls go whose good and bad deeds are too evenly matched to go directly to Paradise or the Fire.\n\nSome Muslim scholars stress the importance of Barzakh, while others simply ignore it. \n\nIn Sufism the Barzakh or \"Alam-e-Araf\" is not only where the human soul resides after death but it is also a place that the soul can visit during sleep and meditation. Ibn 'Arabi, defines Barzakh as the intermediate realm or \"isthmus\". It is between the World of Corporeal Bodies and the World of Spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. It is described as simple and luminous, like the World of Spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the World of Corporeal Bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, “is anything that separates two things”. It has been described as the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.\n\nBarzakh can also refer to a person. Chronologically between Jesus and Mohammad is the contested Prophet Khalid. Ibn 'Arabi considers this man to be a “Barzakh” or the Perfect Human Being. Chittick explains that the Perfect Human acts as the \"Barzakh\" or \"isthmus\" between God and the world. Ibn 'Arabi's story of Prophet Khalid is a story of Perfect Human being.\n\nKhalid's story is of a Prophet whose message never emerged because before he died, he told his sons to open his tomb forty days after his death to receive the message of Barzakh. The sons, however, feared they would be looked down upon for opening their dead father's tomb, therefore they decided not to exhume their father. Thus, his message was never shared. An Ottoman Scholar explained that for Khalid to give the knowledge of Barzakh he would have to travel through the different worlds and then return, but because he was not exhumed, his message was never heard. Ibn 'Arabi explains that because this mission ended in failure, it does not conflict with The Prophet Mohammed’s statement: “ am nearest of men to Jesus son of Mary, for there is no prophet between him and me.\"\n\nThe idea of Barzakh in Shia is significant though in a perspective and manner different from Sufism. The Prophet and Shia Imams, particularly the 6th Imam - Imam Jafar As-Sadiq, have explained through various hadiths the treatment, condition, processes, and other intricate details regarding the passage of Barzakh. In Shia theology, there are 7 checkpoints in Barzakh. The first being kindness/trust/wilayah. Second is salaat. Third is zakaat/khums. Fourth is fasting. Fifth is hajj. Sixth is cleanliness. Seventh is rights. It is believed that the terms and conditions to understand Barzakh are limited in scope and full comprehension because it is Shia's belief that it is incomprehensible, to a certain degree, until one actually reaches the realm beyond our physical world. A common analogy used is that of a baby in the womb. Just as the baby cannot possibly begin to understand the vast outside world until they experience it for themselves, we cannot hope to understand what Barzakh entails until we transition there ourselves. Though despite this obstacle, the Shia Imams, as cited through various sayings, have explained Barzakh to a significant degree as compared to other sects within Islam.\n\nThe term has also found its way into more contemporary, non-religious sectors of life. At least three bands have adopted the name Barzakh, including an Indonesian Jakarta black metal band, a Tunisian Oriental metal band and Naqash Ali Shawkat band. Additionally, Barzakh was used as the title of a 2011 documentary following citizens of a war-torn Chechan community searching for a lost friend who they believe may have transitioned from our physical world to the realm of Barzakh.\n\n\n"}

A grit bin improves winter road safety on roads which are not gritted by other means, such as from a winter service vehicle.\n\nAnyone may use a grit bin to clear a public path or road, though they are generally not intended for personal use. Typically, a spade or shovel is used to spread a thin layer of grit onto the road surface, covering any snow or ice. The salt lowers the melting point of the snow causing it to melt (see sodium chloride). The grit component improves the friction between a vehicle's tires and the road.\n\nSome grit bins have a small compartment, which could be used for storing a spade or shovel. The one featured in the photograph at the top of the page is filled through the top hatch.\n\nGrit bins were originally made of concrete, wood or even stone, though these are now increasingly being replaced by models constructed from plastic partly from safety concerns: vehicles/people hitting a plastic grit bin will suffer less damage. However, the lower weight of plastic makes grit bins easier to steal or tip over.\n\nGrit bins can be subjected to vandalism, such as arson. The lid can also be left open, leaving rain to wash away the salt in the mixture, rendering it useless. In the United Kingdom, the local county council is usually responsible for maintaining and refilling grit bins.\n\nMembers of the public can inform their local council if a grit bin needs refilling, has been damaged or tipped over, or if there are no bins on a road that is not gritted by any other method.\n\nIn Norway, the problem with tipping grit bins over have been solved by making them large enough to hold about 500 kg of grit, and to continually keep it topped up. \n"}

In folklore, the Dutch Kabouters are akin to the Irish Leprechaun, Scandinavian Tomte or Nisse, the English Hob, the Scottish Brownie and the German Klabauter or kobold. \n\nIn the folklore of the Low Countries, kabouters are tiny people who live underground, in a hill for instance. (In modern children's stories they live in mushrooms.) They are also spirits who help in the home. The males have long, full beards and wear tall, pointed red hats. They are generally shy of humans and in stories often punish people for spying on them. Throughout Flanders and the Netherlands they exist under a number of different local names like alvermannekes or auwelkes.\n\nThere is a theory that their appearance, little red pointy hats running through the forest, can be attributed to hallucinations from eating mushrooms. Though not associated with narcotics by the general public, they appear in the iconography of smart shops. Another theory connects the gnomes with the sightings of red squirrels.\n\nIn the \"Legend of the Wooden Shoes,\" an old Dutch folktale, a kabouter teaches a Dutch man how to make piles and how to make wooden shoes.\n\nThe Dutch illustrator Rien Poortvliet played an important part in modern Kabouter lore with his publication of \"Leven en werken van de Kabouter\" (English title \"Life and works of the Gnome\"), later translated into English and published as \"Gnomes\". \n\nIn popular culture today, the business Travelocity uses a Rien Poortvliet-style statue of a Kabouter for commercials. They call him the Travelocity Roaming Gnome.\n\nThe term \"kabouter\" was also adopted by a 1970s hippie movement in Amsterdam that sprang from the Provo movement (see Kabouters).

{"id": "1761649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1761649", "title": "Submarine canyon", "text": "Submarine canyon\n\nA submarine canyon is a steep-sided valley cut into the seabed of the continental slope, sometimes extending well onto the continental shelf, having nearly vertical walls, and occasionally having canyon wall heights of up to 5 km, from canyon floor to canyon rim, as with the Great Bahama Canyon. Just as above-sea-level canyons serve as channels for the flow of water across land, submarine canyons serve as channels for the flow of turbidity currents across the seafloor. Turbidity currents are flows of dense, sediment laden waters that are supplied by rivers, or generated on the seabed by storms, submarine landslides, earthquakes, and other soil disturbances. Turbidity currents travel down slope at great speed (as much as 70 km/h), eroding the continental slope and finally depositing sediment onto the abyssal plain, where the particles settle out.\n\nAbout 3% of submarine canyons include shelf valleys that have cut transversely across continental shelves, and which begin with their upstream ends in alignment with and sometimes within the mouths of large rivers, such as the Congo River and the Hudson Canyon. About 28.5% of submarine canyons cut back into the edge of the continental shelf, whereas the majority (about 68.5%) of submarine canyons have not managed at all to cut significantly across their continental shelves, having their upstream beginnings or \"heads\" on the continental slope, below the edge of continental shelves.\n\nThe formation of submarine canyons is believed to occur as the result of at least two main process: 1) erosion by turbidity current erosion; and 2) slumping and mass wasting of the continental slope. While at first glance, the erosion patterns of submarine canyons may appear to mimic those of river-canyons on land, due to the markedly different erosion processes that have been found to take place underwater at the soil/ water interface, several notably different erosion patterns have been observed in the formation of typical submarine canyons.\n\nMany canyons have been found at depths greater than 2 km below sea level. Some may extend seawards across continental shelves for hundreds of kilometres before reaching the abyssal plain. Ancient examples have been found in rocks dating back to the Neoproterozoic. Turbidites are deposited at the downstream mouths or ends of canyons, building an abyssal fan.\n\nSubmarine canyons are more common on the steep slopes found on active margins compared to those on the gentler slopes found on passive margins. They show erosion through all substrates, from unlithified sediment to crystalline rock. Canyons are steeper, shorter, more dendritic and more closely spaced on active than on passive continental margins. The walls are generally very steep and can be near vertical. The walls are subject to erosion by bioerosion, or slumping. There are an estimated 9,477 submarine canyons on Earth, covering about 11% of the continental slope.\n\n\nDifferent mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of submarine canyons. Their primary causes have been subject to debate since the early 1930s.\n\nAn early and obvious theory was that the canyons present today were carved during glacial times, when sea level was about 125 meters below present sea level, and rivers flowed to the edge of the continental shelf. However, while many (but not all) canyons are found offshore from major rivers, subaerial river erosion cannot have been active to the water depths as great as 3000 meters where canyons have been mapped, as it is well established (by many lines of evidence) that sea levels did not fall to those depths.\n\nThe major mechanism of canyon erosion is thought to be turbidity currents and underwater landslides. Turbidity currents are dense, sediment-laden currents which flow downslope when an unstable mass of sediment that has been rapidly deposited on the upper slope fails, perhaps triggered by earthquakes. There is a spectrum of turbidity- or density-current types ranging from \"muddy water\" to massive mudflow, and evidence of both these end members can be observed in deposits associated with the deeper parts of submarine canyons and channels, such as lobate deposits (mudflow) and levees along channels.\n\nMass wasting, slumping, and submarine landslides are forms of slope failures (the effect of gravity on a hillslope) observed in submarine canyons. Mass wasting is the term used for the slower and smaller action of material moving downhill. Slumping is generally used for rotational movement of masses on a hillside. Landslides, or slides, generally comprise the detachment and displacement of sediment masses.\n\nIt is now understood that many mechanisms of submarine canyon creation have had effect to greater or lesser degree in different places, even within the same canyon, or at different times during a canyon's development. However, if a primary mechanism must be selected, the downslope lineal morphology of canyons and channels and the transportation of excavated or loose materials of the continental slope over extensive distances require that various kinds of turbidity or density currents act as major participants.\n\nIn addition to the processes described above, submarine canyons that are especially deep may form by another method. In certain cases, a sea with a bed significantly below sea level is cut off from the larger ocean to which it is usually connected. The sea which is normally repleted by contact and inflow from the ocean is now no longer replenished and hence dries up over a period of time, which can be very short if the local climate is arid. In this scenario, rivers that previously flowed into the sea at a sea level elevation now can cut far deeper into the bottom of the bed now exposed. The Messinian Salinity Crisis is an example of this phenomenon; between five and six million years ago, the Mediterranean Sea became isolated from the Atlantic Ocean and evaporated away in roughly a thousand years. During this time, the Nile River delta, among other rivers, extended far beyond its present location, both in depth and length. In a cataclysmic event, the Mediterranean sea basin was flooded. One relevant consequence is that the submarine canyons eroded are now far below the present sea level.\n\n"}

The emulsion is of a \"water in oil\" type unlike the \"oil in water\" type emulsion of vanishing cream, so-called because it seems to disappear when applied on skin. The name \"cold cream\" derives from the cooling feeling that the cream leaves on the skin. Variations of the product have been used for nearly 2000 years.\n\nCold cream is mainly used for skin treatment (such as a facial mask or lip balm), due to its moisturizing properties. It can also be used to remove makeup and as shaving cream.\n\nThe invention of cold cream is credited to Galen, a physician in second century Greece. This 1857 account relates:\n\nIn France, this substance is still known as ('Galen's Wax'). A copy of the \"London Dispensatory\", edited by Nicholas Culpeper and published in the year 1650 included the following formula for this substance:\n\nAn 1814 poem credited to \"Dr. Russell\" gives the following account of the benefits attributed to cold cream in that day:\n\nCold cream now replaces the olive oil with mineral oil or other oils, which are cheaper and slower to spoil, as well as alcohol, glycerin, and lanolin. Beginning in the 1970s, jojoba oil became a common ingredient, used as a substitute of sperm oil from whales. Another common ingredient in modern cold cream is borax, which is also responsible for the whiteness of cold cream. Widely sold brands of cold cream in the United States include Pond's and Noxzema. \n\nOver the centuries, new uses have been found for the product: \"As a toilet requisite cold cream is used for softening and cooling the skin after sunburn, as a cleansing cream, to relieve harshness of the skin, etc\".\n"}

The doughnut is deep-fried, filled with jam or custard, and then topped with powdered sugar.\n\nThe Hebrew word \"sufganiyah\" is a neologism for pastry, based on the Talmudic words \"sofgan\" and \"sfogga\", which refer to a \"spongy dough\". The word has also been compared to the Modern Hebrew word for sponge (\"sfog\", ; \"isfanj\", ). Sfenj, a Maghrebi doughnut, comes from the same root.\n\nA popular Israeli folktale holds that the word \"\"sufganiyah\"\" comes from the Hebrew expression \"\"Sof Gan Yud-Heh\"\" (\"סוף גן יה\"), meaning \"the end of the Garden of the Lord\" (referring to the Garden of Eden). According to the legend, when Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden by the Lord, He cheered them up by feeding them \"sufganiyot\". No known commentator on the Tanakh supports this interpretation.\n\nOn Hanukkah, Jews observe the custom of eating fried foods in commemoration of the miracle associated with the Temple oil. The tradition of eating deep-fried pastries on Hanukkah was considered ancient even in the time of the 12th-century rabbi Maimonides, whose father, Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef, wrote that \"one must not make light of the custom of eating \"sofganim\" [fried fritters] on Chanukah. It is a custom of the \"Kadmonim\" [the ancient ones]\". These \"sofganim\" were likely syrup-soaked fried cakes, akin to modern \"zalabiya\" in the Arab world. Pastries similar to \"sufganiyot\" were prepared in the Jewish diaspora before the advent of the state of Israel. These were called \"bimuelos\" by Sephardi Jews, and \"ponchiks\" (Russian: Пончик) by Ashkenazi Jews.\n\nUntil the 1920s, \"sufganiyot\" and latkes were of comparable popularity in Palestine during Hanukkah. The Histadrut, Israel's national labor union formed in 1920, pushed to replace the homemade latke with the \"sufganiyah\" as Israel's quintessential Hanukkah food in order to provide more work for its members. Commercial bakeries began selling \"sufganiyot\" days and weeks before Hanukkah began, lengthening the employment period. Their effort was successful, and \"sufganiyot\" became the most popular food for Hanukkah in Israel. Some sources report that something similar happened with \"sfenj\" and \"sufganiyot\", though this is less well-supported. By the 21st century, more Israeli Jews report eating \"sufganiyot\" on Hanukkah than fasting on Yom Kippur.\n\nThe \"ponchik\"-style \"sufganiyah\" was originally made from two circles of dough surrounding a jelly filling, stuck together and fried in one piece. Although this method is still practiced, an easier technique commonly used today is to deep-fry whole balls of dough, and then inject them with a filling through a baker's syringe (or a special industrial machine).\n\nModern-day \"sufganiyot\" in Israel are made from sweet yeast dough, filled with plain red jelly (usually strawberry, sometimes raspberry), and topped with powdered sugar. They cost about $0.30 each. More expensive versions (priced at up to $3 per \"sufganiyah\") are stuffed with dulce de leche, chocolate cream, vanilla cream, cappuccino, halva, creme espresso, chocolate truffle, or \"araq\", and topped with various extravagant toppings, from coconut shavings and tiny vials of liquor to meringue and fruit pastes. In 2014 one Jerusalem bakery produced \"sufganiyah\" dough saturated with flavored vodka.\n\nBakeries and grocery stores build excitement for the approaching holiday by selling \"sufganiyot\" individually and by the box; they have become a favorite for school and office parties. Angel Bakeries, the largest bakery in Israel, reportedly fries up more than 25,000 \"sufganiyot\" every day during the eight-day Hanukkah festival. Each batch uses 100 kilograms of dough and makes 1,600 \"sufganiyot\". Local newspapers add to the excitement by rating the \"best \"sufganiyah\" in town\".\n\nThe Ministry of Defense buys upwards of 400,000 \"sufganiyot\" for its soldiers each Hanukkah. As the troops overwhelmingly prefer jelly-filled doughnuts, the Defense Ministry purchases 80% with jelly filling and 20% with chocolate filling.\n\nIn 2016, Israeli bakeries began downsizing \"sufganiyot\" to appeal to health-conscious consumers, following an anti-junk food campaign by Health Minister Yaakov Litzman. The usual size, packing 400 to 600 calories (1,700 to 2,500 kJ), now appears in size with different fillings and toppings, earning the name \"mini.\"\n\nSavory \"sufganiyot\", though rare, do exist. Versions include:\n\n\n"}

In Jewish communities, lekvár is a common filling for hamentashen.\n\nTo prepare the fruit, seeds are removed. To remove the seeds, apples are cored and cherries, plums and apricots are pitted. Grape skins are separated from the pulp. The pulp is cooked until liquid, then strained to remove the seeds. The strained pulp and skins are then combined and cooked further.\nThe fruit butter is prepared by cooking the fruit, including the skins, in water until soft. Skins are retained to improve the flavor, texture, and color. Once the fruit is soft, sugar may be added, if desired. Prune and apricot butter generally require no added sugar. The fruit butter then is cooked slowly, adding water so that it does not burn, until both thickened and macerated to the desired extent. The lekvár is filled in jars and the jars are steamed and locked.\n\nHungarian lekvár, jam, from Slovak lekvár, meaning electuary, from Middle High German \"lactwarje\", \"latwarge\", from Old French \"leituaire\", from Late Latin \"electuarium\".\n\nThe first use of the term \"lekvár\" was noted from before 1350, used by medical practitioners as a medicinal paste or syrup to hide the medicine taste.\n\nIn Hungary, good housekeeping calls for homemade lekvár cooking in the autumn, when most fruits are ripened. In Poland, lekvár is a regional food cooked in the Lower Vistula Valley in Poland. Several villages organize folk feasts, during which lekvár is cooked in copper kettles (cauldrons).\n\n"}

It is produced and distributed by The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers in the United States and some international markets.\n\nLong before its official introduction in stores in 1985, many diners and drugstore soda fountains dispensed an unofficial version by adding cherry-flavored syrup to Coca-Cola. The Coca-Cola Company first began testing its official Cherry flavored version of Coke along with other flavors on audiences visiting the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. Cherry Coke then entered mainstream production during the summer of 1985. Cherry Coke, which by 2007 had been renamed Coca-Cola Cherry in the U.S. and some other countries, was the third variation of Coca-Cola at that time – the others being regular Coca-Cola and Diet Coke – and the first flavored Coke. It was released nationally around the same time as the controversial reformulation of Coca-Cola, (New Coke), and gained significant market share when that product was widely discontinued in the early 1990s.\nDiet Cherry Coke was introduced in 1986, and renamed \"Diet Coke Cherry\" in 2005 and again to \"Diet Coke Feisty Cherry\" in 2018. A second low-calorie version, Coca-Cola Cherry Zero (based on Coca-Cola Zero), was added in 2007.\nThe Coca-Cola Company would later introduce other flavored Coke variants, beginning with Vanilla Coke in May 2002, later followed by lime,\nraspberry, lemon, Black Cherry Vanilla and orange variants. Many of these are currently only sold in overseas markets and/or are microdispensed through Coca-Cola's Freestyle vending machines.\n\nCoca-Cola Cherry has been distributed in a number of different countries. Currently, in addition to the U.S., the drink is available in Albania, China, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Finland, Germany, Belgium (only in cans and 1-litre bottles), Denmark, France, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Croatia, Latvia, South Africa, South Korea, Bulgaria, Greece (only in cans), Romania and Peru. It is also available in Japan, where it is still known as Cherry Coke. Until recently it was available in Ireland only through British pharmaceutical chains such as Boots and Superdrug, however it returned officially to the country in 2014.\nIn New Zealand, Coca-Cola Cherry can be found in some supermarkets (usually imported from the UK or US).\nIn the past, the product has been distributed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Israel. \nThe Australian version was released between 2003 and 2004 and was a different formula to the US version. It is no longer bottled in these countries, although the U.S. product is imported by some Canadian convenience stores near the Canada–US border, as well as by IGA, Costco and specialty retailers in Australia. It was reintroduced in all Canadian grocery stores in 2016. In Sweden it is available at different grocery stores. The grocery stores source import from the United States and the self-produced Coca-Cola Cherry from Coca-Cola enterprises Sweden. In Norway, Coca-Cola Cherry is available at select stores.\n\nSince January 2011, Coca-Cola Cherry is also available in Switzerland, where it is distributed by Coop. Since July 2013 Coca-Cola Cherry is available in Croatia, Romania and Spain. It returned to Canada by the 2013, 2014, and 2015 holiday season in cases of 24 cans at Costco stores for the two former, and general retail in the latter. It featured the same flavour and formula as the United States flavour, with a slightly edited, bilingual version of that country's can design. In 2014, it was featured as one of the last major attempts by Target Canada in Ontario to gain market share before announcing its closing in January of the following year. It has been mentioned by Target Canada itself that Cherry Coke was the number one requested grocery request by shoppers.\n\nAs of July 2014 Coca-Cola Cherry is available in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (due to same label for the three countries). The label is same as regular coke but with different cherry color and cherry word below Coca-cola with an image of Cherry to the left of the word \"cherry\". Later in late 2014, it was introduced in Uruguay (only in cans).\nBy the end of 2014, it was gone from the Lithuanian market, and maybe the whole Baltic region.\n\nCoca-Cola Cherry returned to Canada once again in the summer of 2015 and 2016 as part of the \"Share a Coke\" campaign. Cherry Coke, in flats of 24 cans, have recently been available at Safeway, Sobeys, and Loblaws-owned stores across Canada with markings indicating production at the Brampton, Ontario bottling facility.\n\nCoca-Cola Cherry returned to Brazil during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Originally available in certain markets in the country, availability of soft drink has expanded to other regions, while Cherry Coke has been relaunched, Vanilla Coke has also been launched.\n\nPackaging for Coca-Cola Cherry differs greatly from country to country. Coca-Cola has altered the logos and label designs for Coca-Cola Cherry several times since it was introduced in 1985. In most areas, the current can and bottle label designs are based on the standard Coca-Cola label in a pink or purple hue, often with images of cherries.\n\nOn February 7, 2007, Coca-Cola launched a new campaign for the Coca-Cola Cherry brand in the U.S., resulting in a significant redesign of the product's label. Jay-Z was chosen to be the spokesman and played a part in designing the new can graphics. A new diet version, Coca-Cola Cherry Zero, was also introduced. The original Diet Coke Cherry had still remained available in 12-packs up until 2018 when it was replaced with Diet Coke Feisty Cherry. These designs remained in place until early 2011, when a cleaner design (closer to the label designs used overseas) was introduced.\n\nAs part of Coca-Cola's ongoing \"One Brand\" marketing campaign, a new U.S. packaging design for Coca-Cola Cherry was introduced in January 2019. The new packaging follows the design principles already employed in the United States for Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, and Coca-Cola Life. The word \"Coca-Cola\" is superimposed upon a red disc with a picture of a cherry below the text. The background color of the can or bottle remains the same shade of purple introduced in the 2007 design. The word \"Cherry\" is placed above the red disc, similar to the \"Original Taste\" text currently used on cans and bottles of original Coca-Cola.\n"}

It was introduced, under the brand name Pepsi Free, in 1982 by PepsiCo as the first major-brand caffeine-free cola sold in years. A sugar-free variant, originally known as Diet Pepsi Free, was also introduced. The \"Pepsi Free\" name itself was phased out in 1987, and today these colas are known simply as Caffeine-Free Pepsi and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi.\n\nWhen it was first introduced, Caffeine Free Pepsi's label background was originally red, but to avoid any confusion with Coca-Cola, the background color was changed to gold in 1987. As part of Pepsi's changing their background to blue in 1998, Pepsi Caffeine Free's background changed to blue with the letters outlined in gold. In 2008, the caffeine-free version has reverted to its gold background. (Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola labels also have a gold background. The logo letters are bordered in red for the regular variety, in the case of the diet variety, they are entirely red in color.)\n\nTwo cans of Pepsi Free are seen, at separate times, in the 1983 film \"Mr. Mom\".\n\nPepsi Free was the subject of a scene in the 1985 film \"Back to the Future.\" Upon entering a café in 1955, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) asks for a Tab (Coca-Cola's first version of a sugar-free soft drink, which was not available until 1963) and is told that he cannot have a \"tab,\" unless he orders something. He then asks for a Pepsi Free (also not available in the 1950s) and is told, \"If you want a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it!\" (\"Free\" is here being mistaken for \"gratis.\") Finally, he asks for \"\"something\" without any sugar in it,\" and is served black coffee.\n\nA can of Diet Pepsi Free can be seen beside Marty's alarm clock towards the beginning of the movie when Doc (Christopher Lloyd) calls him to remind him to meet him at the mall. The can is also seen toward the end of the movie when Marty wakes up in the morning at his house in 1985.\n\nWhen introduced, Pepsi Free was available in cans, 2 liter bottles, and 20 ounce glass bottles. Caffeine-Free Pepsi is currently available in cans, 16 oz. plastic bottles and 2 liters, though availability varies from store to store (for instance, 16 oz. bottles are typically only available in convenience stores, and some grocers may only have the product in 12 oz cans, if they carry it at all).\n\n"}

{"id": "1777552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1777552", "title": "Sadhya", "text": "Sadhya\n\nSadhya () is a feast of Hindu origin and of importance to Hindu Malayalis,consisting of a variety of traditional vegetarian dishes usually served on a banana leaf in Kerala, India. Sadhya means banquet in Malayalam. It is a vegetarian feast prepared by both men and women, especially when needed in large quantities, for weddings and other special events. Sadhya is typically served as a traditional dish for Onam, an annual Kerala festival.\n\nA typical Sadhya can have about 24–28 dishes served as a single course. In cases where it is a much larger one it can have over 64 or more items, such as the Sadhya for Aranmula Boatrace (Valla Sadhya). It is eaten in certain ritual style and environment preceded and succeeded by vanchippatu (traditional boat race songs). In this sadhya the guests can also ask for some surprise items that the host should be prepared for. It has to be prepared by approved chefs to be eligible as a valla sadhya, where physical and spiritual purity is important. During a traditional Sadhya celebration people are seated cross-legged on mats. Food is eaten with the right hand, without cutlery. The fingers are cupped to form a ladle.\n\nThe main dish is plain boiled rice, served along with other dishes collectively called \"Kootan\" (കൂട്ടാന്‍) which include curries like parippu, sambar, rasam, pulisseri and others like kaalan, avial, thoran, olan, pachadi, pichadi, koottukari, erissery, mango pickle, pulinji, naranga achaar (lime pickle), as well as papadam, plantain chips, sharkara upperi, banana, plain curd and buttermilk. The buttermilk is typically served near the end of the meal. The traditional dessert called payasam served at the end of the meal is of many kinds and usually three or more are served. Some of the varieties are Paal Ada, Ada Pradhaman, Paripu pradhaman, chakkapradhaman, etc. The 'Kootan' are made with different vegetables and have different flavours; some say the reason for including so many dishes in the Sadhya is to ensure that the diners will like at least a few dishes.\nThe dishes are served on specific places on the banana leaf in specific order. For example, the pickles are served on the top left corner and the banana on the bottom left corner, which helps the waiters to easily identify and decide on offering additional servings. The most common ingredients in all the dishes are rice, vegetables, coconut and coconut oil as they are abundant in Kerala. Coconut milk is used in some dishes and coconut oil is used for frying and also as an ingredient in others.\n\nThere are variations in the menu depending on the place and religion. Some communities, especially those in the northern part of Kerala, include non-vegetarian dishes in the sadhya. Although custom was to use traditional and seasonal vegetables indigenous to Kerala or South West Coast of India, it has become common practice to include vegetables such as carrots, pineapples, beans in the dishes. Tradition has it that Onion and garlic are not typically used in the sadhya. Conventionally, the meal may be followed by \"vettila murukkan\", chewing of betel leaf with lime and arecanut. This helps digestion of the meal and also cleanses the palate.\n\nThe sadhya is usually served for lunch, although a lighter version is served for dinner too. Preparations begin the night before, and the dishes are prepared before ten o' clock in the morning on the day of the celebration. On many occasions, sadhya is served on tables, as people no longer find it convenient to sit on the floor. Sourcing of items/ingredients for Sadhya is an elaborate and careful process to ensure quality. The lighting of the fire to prepare the sadhya is done after a prayer to Agni and the first serving is offered on a banana leaf in front of a lighted nilavilallku as an offering to god.\n\nTraditionally, the people of the neighborhood spent the night helping the cooks in cooking. They also volunteer to serve the food for the hosts to the guests. This involves a fair amount of social interaction which help build rapport with the neighbors.\n\nSadhya is served in Pankthi (Sanskrit) - panti in Malayalam - meaning in lines or rounds where sets of people are served in sitting lines, on the floor earlier, now on benches and desks. There can be many Pankti's depending upon total size of the crowd and the capacity of the place. The hosts normally sits only during the last pankti. The host will eat at the last and will go around every pankti/panti to greet the guests and to ensure that they are satisfied.\n\nIn a Sadhya, the meals are served on a banana leaf. The leaf is folded and closed once the meal is finished. In some instances, closing the leaf toward you communicates satisfaction with the meal, while folding it away from oneself signifies that the meal can be improved. However, the direction the leaf is folded in can have different meanings in various parts of India.\n\nThe Central Travancore-style sadhya is renowned to be the most disciplined and tradition-bound. There is usually an order followed in serving the dishes, starting from the chips and pickles first. However, different styles and approaches to making and serving the dishes are adopted in various parts of Kerala depending on local preferences.\n\nThe items include:\n\nThese side dishes are followed by desserts like Prathaman and Payasams. There is a strict order and placement of ingredients on the banana leaf. Aranmula Valla Sadhya is the most celebrated one with over 64 items served in the traditional way.\n\n\"Prathaman\" is a sweet dish in the form of a thick liquid; similar to payasam, but with more variety in terms of ingredients and more elaborately made. It is made with white sugar or jaggery to which coconut milk is added. The main difference between a prathaman and a payasam is that the former uses coconut milk, while the liquid versions of payasam use cow's milk.\n\n"}

It may be defined as mass of a certain volume of a substance divided by mass of same volume of hydrogen.\n\nvapour density = mass of \"n\" molecules of gas / mass of \"n\" molecules of hydrogen.\nThus:\n\nvapour density = molar mass of gas / molar mass of H\n\nvapour density = molar mass of gas / 2.016\n\nvapour density = ~½ × molar mass\n\nFor example, vapour density of mixture of NO and NO is 38. 3.Vapour density is a unitless quantity.\n\nIn many web sources, particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S., vapour density is defined with respect to air, not hydrogen. Air is given a vapour density of one. For this use, air has a molecular weight of 28.97 atomic mass units, and all other gas and vapour molecular weights are divided by this number to derive their vapour density. For example, acetone has a vapour density of 2 in relation to air. That means acetone vapour is twice as heavy as air. This can be seen by dividing the molecular weight of Acetone, 58.1 by that of air, 28.97, which equals 2.\n\nWith this definition, the vapour density would indicate whether a gas is denser (greater than one) or less dense (less than one) than air. The density has implications for container storage and personnel safety—if a container can release a dense gas, its vapour could sink and, if flammable, collect until it is at a concentration sufficient for ignition. Even if not flammable, it could collect in the lower floor or level of a confined space and displace air, possibly presenting an asphyxiation hazard to individuals entering the lower part of that space.\n\n"}

{"id": "1780928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1780928", "title": "Culottes", "text": "Culottes\n\nCulottes are an item of clothing worn on the lower half of the body. The term can refer to split skirts, historical men's breeches, or women's under-pants; this is an example of fashion-industry words taken from designs across history, languages and cultures, then being used to describe different garments, often creating confusion among historians and readers. The French word \"culotte\" is (a pair of) panties, pants, knickers, trousers, shorts, or (historically) breeches; derived from the French word \"culot\", meaning the lower half of a thing, the lower garment in this case.\n\nIn English-speaking history culottes were originally the knee-breeches commonly worn by gentlemen of the European upper-classes from the late Middle Ages or Renaissance through the early nineteenth century. The style of tight trousers ending just below the knee was popularized in France during the reign of Henry III (1574–1589). Culottes were normally closed and fastened about the leg, to the knee, by buttons, a strap and buckle, or a draw-string. During the French Revolution of 1789–1799, working-class revolutionaries were known as the \"\"sans-culottes\"\" – literally, \"without culottes\" – a name derived from their rejection of aristocratic apparel. In the United States, only the first five Presidents, from George Washington through James Monroe, wore culottes according to the style of the late 18th century.\n\nEuropean Military uniforms incorporated culottes as a standard uniform article, the lower leg being covered by either stockings, leggings, or knee-high boots. Culottes were a common part of military uniforms during the European wars of the eighteenth-century (the Great Northern War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, the Franco-British Colonial Wars, and the American Revolution).\n\nHistorical Japanese field workers and military Samurai wore hakama that were sometimes tight at the bottom as French military culottes. Wider bifurcated wrap-skirt hakama were for horse-back riding. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century European women introduced culottes cut with a pattern looking like long hakama, hiding their legs while riding horses. Today Aikido and Kendo masters wear long hakama, to hide their feet from opponents.\n\nModern English use of the word culottes describes a split or bifurcated skirt or any garment which \"hangs like a skirt, but is actually pants.\" During the Victorian Era (mid- to late-nineteenth century European culture) long split skirts were developed for horseback riding so that women could sit astride a horse with a man's saddle rather than riding side-saddle. Horse-riding culottes for women were controversial because they were used to break a sexual taboo against women riding horses when they were expected to hide their lower limbs at all times. Later, split skirts were developed to provide women more freedom to do other activities as well, such as gardening, cleaning, bike riding, etc. and still look like one is wearing a skirt.\n\nCulottes are used in school uniforms for girls. They can be used along with skirts, or they may be used as a replacement for skirts. Culottes are worn as part of a uniform mainly to primary and middle schools. Culottes were also part of the uniform of UK Brownie Guides up until recently, when the uniform was modernised and the traditional brown culottes (and the navy blue culottes worn by the Girl Guides) were replaced.\n\nIn place of the term culotte, the term skort (a portmanteau for skirt and shorts) is more widely used in some areas. While some garments sold as culottes resemble short trousers, to truly be a skort it needs to look like a skirt. Thus, they differ from trousers or shorts by being much fuller at the bottom (hem) than at the waist. A skort is shorts that have a front covering to resemble a skirt or short pant legs with a same length or longer skirt sewn over the top.\n\nSome culottes have a part sewn over only the front, while some are shorts with a skirt sewn over them. While these may not be completely the same as skorts, they are often called by either name, so either term can apply.\n\nA cut which became popular in 21 century - a combined silhouette of pants which appear to be made out of two separate garments. They look like slim fit jeans from behind, like a skirt or culottes worn on top of slim fit jeans - from the front.\n\nThe term \"culottes\" in French is now used to describe women's panties, an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic men's culotte breeches, except that in French, calling something \"culottes\" is like calling them \"bottoms\". The historical French term \"\"sans-culottes\"\" which was once the rejection of aristrocrats' breeches, is now used colloquially to mean the same as an English colloquialism \"\"going commando\"\" or not wearing under-pants.\n"}

Methods of meat processing include salting, curing, fermentation, and smoking. Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by-products such as blood. Processed meat products include bacon, ham, sausages, salami, corned beef, jerky, canned meat and meat-based sauces. Meat processing includes all the processes that change fresh meat with the exception of simple mechanical processes such as cutting, grinding or mixing.\n\nMeat processing began as soon as people realized that cooking and salting prolongs the life of fresh meat. It is not known when this took place; however, the process of salting and sun-drying was recorded in Ancient Egypt, while using ice and snow is credited to early Romans, and canning was developed by Nicolas Appert who received in 1810 a prize for his invention from the French government.\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer at the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans), because the IARC has found sufficient evidence that consumption of processed meat by humans causes colorectal cancer.\n\nA 2016 report by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund found that processed meat consumption increased the risk of stomach cancer. A 2012 paper by Bryan et. al. identified \"Helicobacter pylori\" as a potential causative agent that warranted further study.\n\nThe preservative sodium nitrite (E250) (mixed into curing-salt) is well known for its role in inhibiting the growth of clostridium botulinum bacteria spores in processed and refrigerated meats. A principal concern about sodium nitrite is the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines in meats containing sodium nitrite when meat is charred or overcooked. Such carcinogenic nitrosamines can also be formed from the reaction of nitrite with secondary amines under acidic conditions (such as occurs in the human stomach) as well as during the curing process used to preserve meats.\n\nNitrate and nitrite are consumed from plant foods as well as animal foods, with 80% of a typical person's nitrate consumption coming from vegetables, especially leafy and root vegetables such as spinach and beets. Some nitrate is converted to nitrite in the human body. Nitrite is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is not directly carcinogenic. Yet, when nitrate or nitrite interact with certain components in red meat, such as heme iron, amines, and amides, they can form nitroso compounds, which may contribute to the association between consumption of processed meats and higher incidence of colorectal cancer.\n\n"}

Its original meaning was someone's occupation (farming, trading, cattle-tending, etc.). It has several distinct but related usages, all having to do with Buddhist meditation.\n\nIts most basic meaning is as a word for meditation. In Burma senior meditation practitioners are known as \"kammatthanacariyas\" (meditation masters). Buddhaghosa uses \"kammatthana\" to refer to each of his forty meditation objects listed in the third chapter of the \"Visuddhimagga\", which are partially derived from the Pāli Canon.\n\nIn the Pali literature, prior to the post-canonical Pali commentaries, the term \"\" comes up in only a handful of discourses and then in the context of \"work\" or \"trade.\"\n\nThe Thai Forest Tradition names itself \"Kammaṭṭhāna Forest tradition\".\n\nOf the forty objects meditated upon as kammatthana, the first ten are 'things that one can behold directly', 'kasina', or 'a whole': \nThe next ten are objects of repulsion (\"asubha\"): \nTen are recollections (\"anussati\"): \nFour are stations of Brahma (\"Brahma-vihara\"): \nFour are formless states (four \"arūpajhānas\"):\n\nOne is of perception of disgust of food (\"aharepatikulasanna\").\n\nThe last is analysis of the four elements (\"catudhatuvavatthana\"): earth (\"pathavi\"), water (\"apo\"), fire (\"tejo\"), air (\"vayo\").\n\nEach kammatthana can be suggested, especially by a spiritual friend (\"\"), to a certain individual student at some specific point, by assessing what would be best for that student's temperament and the present state of his or her mind.\n\nAccording to Gunaratana, following Buddhaghosa, due to the simplicity of subject matter, all four \"jhanas\" can be induced through \"ānāpānasati\" (mindfulness of breathing) and the ten \"kasinas\".\n\nAccording to Gunaratana, the following meditation subjects only lead to \"access concentration\" (\"upacara samadhi\"), due to their complexity: the recollection of the Buddha, dharma, sangha, morality, liberality, wholesome attributes of Devas, death, and peace; the perception of disgust of food; and the analysis of the four elements.\n\nAbsorption in the first \"jhana\" can be realized by mindfulness on the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body. However, these meditations cannot go beyond the first jhana due to their involving applied thought (\"vitaka\"), which is absent from the higher jhanas.\n\nAbsorption in the first three \"jhanas\" can be realized by contemplating the first three \"brahma-viharas\". However, these meditations cannot aid in attaining the fourth jhana due to the pleasant feelings associated with them. Conversely, once the fourth jhana is induced, the fourth \"brahma-vihara\" (equanimity) arises.\n\nAll of the aforementioned meditation subjects can suppress the Five Hindrances, thus allowing one to fruitfully pursue wisdom. In addition, anyone can productively apply specific meditation subjects as antidotes, such as meditating on foulness to counteract lust or on the breath to abandon discursive thought.\n\nThe Pali commentaries further provide guidelines for suggesting meditation subjects based on one's general temperament:\n\nThe six non-color \"kasinas\" and the four formless states are suitable for all temperaments.\n\n\n"}

It is distinguished by two layers of almond paste or marzipan, one in the middle and one on top. The top layer is capped by a circle of \"eggs\" made of the same paste, and is lightly browned under a grill. It was originally made for the fourth Sunday in Lent, also known as Laetare Sunday, the Refreshment Sunday of Lent, Mothering Sunday, the Sunday of the Five Loaves, or Simnel Sunday – named after the cake.\n(when the forty-day fast would be relaxed), although in more recent times it is also eaten throughout the pre-Easter period, and even on Easter Sunday.\n\nConventionally eleven, or occasionally twelve, marzipan balls are used to decorate the cake, with a story that the balls represent the twelve apostles, minus Judas or Jesus and the twelve apostles, minus Judas. An early reference to decorating with marzipan balls appears in May Byron's Pot-Luck Cookery but with no mention of the modern story, and her version may well be derived from earlier styles, which were sometimes crenelated.\n\nSimnel cake is a light fruitcake, generally made from these ingredients: white flour, sugar, butter, eggs, fragrant spices, dried fruits, zest and candied peel. Sometimes orange flower water or brandy is used, either in the cake batter or to flavour the almond paste. In most modern versions marzipan or almond paste is used as a filling for the cake, with a layer laid in the middle of the mix before the cake is cooked, and it is also used as decoration on the top. Most recipes require at least 90 minutes of cooking, and advise using several layers of baking parchment to line the tin, and sometimes brown paper wrapped around the outside to stop the marzipan burning.\n\nSimnel cakes have been known since at least medieval times. Bread regulations of the time suggest they were boiled and then baked, a technique which led to an invention myth, in circulation from at least 1745 until the 1930s, whereby a mythical couple, Simon and Nelly, fall out over making a Simnel. One wishes to boil it, one to bake it and, after beating each other with various household implements, they compromise on one which uses both cooking techniques. \n\nSimnel cakes are often associated with Mothering Sunday, also known as Simnel-Sunday. According to historian Ronald Hutton, in 17th Century Gloucestershire and Worcestershire the custom of live-in apprentices and domestic servants going home to visit their mothers on Mothering Sunday started, checking that their families were well and taking food or money if needed. This was a time of year when food stocks were low, and the high-calorie simnel cake was useful nutrition. The cake later became simply an Easter cake.\nThe meaning of the word \"simnel\" is unclear: there is a 1226 reference to \"bread made into a simnel\", which is understood to mean the finest white bread, from the Latin \"simila\" – \"fine flour\" (from which 'semolina' also derives). John de Garlande felt that the word was equivalent to placenta cake, a cake that was intended to please.\n\nA popular legend attributes the invention of the Simnel cake to Lambert Simnel; however, references to the cake were recorded some 200 years before his birth.\n\nDifferent towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake. Bury, Devizes and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes, but it is the Shrewsbury version that became most popular and well known.\n\n"}

Tender chunks of chicken are combined with crispy roasted cashews, vegetables and are tossed in a light sauce made from garlic, soy sauce and hoisin sauce, thinned with water.\n\nThe deep-fried version of the dish is closely associated with the city of Springfield, Missouri. Deep-fried cashew chicken was apparently first served in 1963 at the Grove Supper Club in Springfield. David Leong, the chef, who moved to the United States from China in 1940, struggled to gain acceptance for the foods of his homeland so he began searching for a dish that would appeal to local residents' taste buds. His famous deep-fried cashew chicken recipe was so popular he soon opened Leong's Tea House in Springfield. The dish became exceedingly popular in the Springfield area and is often cited as the unofficial \"dish of the city\". Springfield even hosts an annual festival that is centered on this chicken dish: Springfield Sertoma's Cashew Craze.\nBorrowing from the local love of fried chicken, Leong came up with a variation of the preexisting dish. Instead of stir-frying the chicken, as is normally done, he deep-fried the chicken chunks. He then covered them with the typical sauce made from chicken stock, soy sauce and oyster sauce, and added the handful of cashews. He also included chopped green onions as a twist and it became an immediate hit with the local crowd. As word spread about the dish, so did the recipe. Leong's Tea House closed its doors in 1997, but Springfield-style cashew chicken is still being served at over 70 Chinese restaurants, as well as many non-Chinese restaurants, in and around the Springfield metropolitan area, and elsewhere in Missouri and other states. Springfield-style cashew chicken has been mentioned on The Food Channel, a nationwide syndicated radio program, and the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn 2010, Leong's son, with his father's assistance, opened a new restaurant in Springfield serving the same style of cashew chicken.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, there is a related stir-fry dish called \"kai pad med mamuang himmapan\" or \"gai pad med ma muang\".\n\nIn Haitian cuisine, there is an unrelated chicken stew with cashews called \"poul ak nwa\".\n\n"}

Shreddies were produced under the Nabisco name until the brand in Canada was purchased in 1993 by Post Cereals, whose parent company in 1995 became Kraft General Foods, which sold Post to Ralcorp in 2008 and is now Post Foods Canada Corp., a unit of Post Holdings, which was spun off from Ralcorp in 2012.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the cereal was first produced by Nabisco's former UK division, but is now made by Cereal Partners under the Nestlé brand at Welwyn Garden City. The factory opened in 1926 and began making Shreddies in 1953. The site was briefly owned by Rank Hovis McDougall in 1988, which sold it to Cereal Partners in 1990. Nestlé's site at Staverton started making Shreddies in 1998, and is where all production was moved in 2007.\n\nThe cereal is marketed with the whole grain symbol, as part of a marketing campaign emphasising the healthiness of the cereal. Wheat for Shreddies is sourced from over 500 different farms within the UK.\n\nSugared, chocolate and honey-flavoured versions of the cereal are available in the UK as Frosted Shreddies, Coco Shreddies, and Honey Shreddies, and an orange-flavoured version of the Coco Shreddies has also become available recently. The former advertising slogan in the UK was: \"Keeps hunger locked up until lunch\". The advertising slogan for the Frosted and Coco Shreddies was: \"Too tasty for geeks\".\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2012, boxes of Shreddies dating from the early 1970s were reported to be selling on eBay, after being discovered in a village shop. They were reported to have been selling for about £160 per box on eBay.\n\n\nShreddies featured as a plot device in the Canadian mockumentary television series created and directed by Mike Clattenburg, the\" Trailer Park Boys\".

It is a cocoa flavored version of Rice Krispies. Containing a substance imitating milk chocolate, the cereal can turn milk \"chocolatey.\"\n\nThe cereal was introduced in the United States in 1958. In 2003, the cereal was renamed Cocoa Rice Krispies, as Kellogg's endeavored to unite their Rice Krispies variations under a single marketing schema. In 2006, the name was changed back to Cocoa Krispies. Kellogg's has released variations of Cocoa Krispies such as Cocoa Krispies Cereal Straws, Cocoa Krispies Choconilla, and Chocos.\n\nThe cereal is known as Choco Krispis in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, and Choco Krispies in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. \n\nIt was introduced in the United Kingdom as Coco Pops in 1961, and is also known by that name in the Netherlands, Denmark, Nigeria, Bulgaria, Ghana, Malta, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Finland, Italy, Greece, Sweden, Belgium, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Ukraine, Botswana, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Australia, Turkey and Republic of Korea and as Choco Pops in France. Later in the 1960s, the name was changed to Coco Krispies, but subsequently reverted to Coco Pops.\n\nThe cereal was available in Canada for a time, but was discontinued at some point in the early 1990s. Instead, Kellogg's sells a variant called Rice Krispies Cocoa, which is simply Rice Krispies with a light chocolate flavor. Several spin off cereals using the \"Coco Pops\" name, such as Caramel Flavoured Coco Pops, Coco Pops Crunchers, Coco Chex, Coco Rocks, Coco Pops Straws, Coco Pops Moon & Stars, Coco Pops Choc-N-Roll and Coco Pops Croc Prints (shaped like Crafty Croc's feet) have also been released by Kellogg's in some countries. \n\nChocos were introduced in some countries as Coco Pops Mega Munchers. A chocolate flavor porridge variant had been available in the end of 2000s called Coco Pops Porridge, but didn't last long. Since 2014, they have been brought back.\n\nIn February 1998, the British arm of Kellogg's renamed the brand in the country Choco Krispies, so it would be similar to the way the product was branded in the rest of the world. However, sales quickly declined, and in the spring 1999, telephone and internet poll with over one million voters found that 92% of voters wanted the name changed back to Coco Pops. \n\nThus, Kellogg's reverted to the original name in May 1999. The advertising campaign for the poll featured newsreader Alastair Burnet and Screaming Lord Sutch as the returning officer in a town hall election setting.\n\nCocoa Krispies first appeared in the United States in 1958, represented by a monkey named Jose. He was reportedly replaced by Coco the Elephant in 1960 when Mexican-Americans complained about the ethnic stereotype. In 1963, the Hanna-Barbera character Snagglepuss took over as the mascot. Ogg the Caveman took over towards the end of 1967. \n\nBy the end of 1973, Tusk the Elephant became the mascot of the cereal, and he remained until the end of 1982, when Snap, Crackle and Pop (the mascots of Rice Krispies) replaced and retired Tusk the Elephant. In 1991, the mascot became Coco the Monkey. In 2001, Snap, Crackle, and Pop returned and they have remained the product's mascots to date.\n\nThe cereal was introduced in the United Kingdom under the \"Coco Pops\" name in 1961, with Mr. Jinks as the mascot. Later in the 1960s, Sweep (a dog hand puppet from the popular children's television programme \"The Sooty Show\") became the mascot for Coco Pops. \n\nIn 1963, Coco the Monkey was introduced, and he remains the mascot in those countries where the cereal is known as Coco Pops, Choco Krispies, and Choco Pops. In recent years, the design of Coco has been refined to give him a younger look. Coco's friends are Shortie Giraffe, Alan Anteater, Heftie Hippo, Ozmelda Ostrich, Kylie Kangaroo, and Rocky Raccoon, while Crafty Croc and the gorillas are his arch enemies.\n\nIn 1986, the cereal introduced the mascot Simmo. It became popular quickly, with a short stint on the face of the merchandise and packaging for Cocoa Krispies. The Simmo mascot featured on various materials for around about three months. Simmo also starred in an advert for the company in 1986, alongside a female companion who only appeared once named \"Heapo\", a cartoon hippopotamus.\n\nMore recent advertisements (2009) in the United Kingdom have opted away from using Coco and his friends opting for things such as dancing milkmen and astronauts. Coco is still present on the box of the cereal and at the end of the advertisement but is no longer the feature character. However, the cereal box of 2009 has Coco's head as the main feature, with the title 'Coco Pops' and the cereal bowl smaller and on the right of the box. Briefly Coco was seen as a real life chimp. As of 2011, Kellogg's decided to bring Coco and his friends as well as Croc back, under a new space age style campaign known as the \"Coco Pops Promise\".\n\nIn those countries where the cereal is known as \"Choco Krispis,\" an elephant is the mascot. In 1986, Kelloggs named the elephant \"Melvin\". Recently, he has been called \"Commando Melvin\" due to commercials featuring him a space faring fighter and adventurer, note that this is due to a misunderstanding, as Commando Melvin in the commercials refers exclusively to the organization featured in them whose purpose is to defend the \"forti calcio plus\" a supposed ingredient in the cereal from aliens or other such villains.\n\nIn July 2014, in Mexico, due to concerns about the sugary and caloric contents of the cereal and the relation kids made with the friendly mascot, Melvin the elephant had a physical transformation from a traditional elephant body to an athletic body resembling a strong teenager while keeping the head of the mascot, the cereal too had a recipe transformation to add more vitamins and minerals in order to focus the product into a health is fun type of communication. \n\nIn Australia, the mascot is Coco the Monkey.\n\nCoco Pops received two stars out of five on the Australian Government's health star ratings.\n\nKellogg's was criticized by health authorities in the United States and consumer experts in October 2009, when it unveiled a description on its boxes of Cocoa Krispies cereal that stated \"now helps support your child's immunity\". Kellogg's responded that it didn't create the new copy to capitalize on the H1N1 virus concerns, but added \"Kellogg developed this product in response to consumers expressing a need for more positive nutrition.\" \n\nThe FDA may yet rule on the Kellogg's claim and some observers deplored Kellogg's marketing tactic. Compared to all claims on cereal boxes, \"This one belongs in the hall of fame,\" said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. \"By their logic, you can spray vitamins on a pile of leaves, and it will boost immunity.\"\n\nThere is concern that advertisements featuring, for example, children in playgrounds target children. LCM bars of the type advertised contain 30% sugar which the advertisement failed to mention. Advertisements by bus stops feature, \"\"Ever thought of Coco Pops after school?\"\" and parents fear children will want Coco Pops instead of healthier foods. Official support by Kellogg's for an anti childhood obesity campaign is seen as hypocritical.\n\n\n"}

The nacatamal is perhaps the most produced within traditional Nicaraguan cuisine and it is an event often reserved for Sundays at mid-morning, it is usually eaten together with fresh bread and coffee with milk. It is common to enjoy nacatamales (plural) during special occasions and to invite extended family and neighbors to partake.\n\nA nacatamal is made up of mostly nixtamalized corn \"masa\" (a kind of dough traditionally made from a process called \"nizquezar\") and lard, but includes seasonings such as salt and \"achiote\" (annatto). This combination is traditionally cooked in a large batch over a wood fire. The result becomes the base for the nacatamal and it is also referred to as \"masa\". This base is ladled onto plantain leaves used for wrapping into large individual portions. The leaves undergo their own preparation separately. Before a nacatamal can be wrapped and brought to the last stage of the cooking process, it must be filled. The filling usually consists of annatto-seasoned pork meat, rice, slices of potatoes, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions; olives, spearmint sprigs, and chile , a very small, egg-shaped chile found in Nicaragua. On occasion, prunes, raisins or capers can be added. The masa and filling are then wrapped in the plantain leaves, tied with a string, and made into pillow-shaped bundles - \"nacatamales\". They are then steamed or pressure-cooked for several hours. The entire process is very labor-intensive and it often requires preparation over the course of two days; it may be necessary to involve the whole family to complete it.\n\nToday it is common to wrap Nacatamales in both banana leaf and aluminum foil before boiling. Boiling takes up to 5 hours and at the midway point the Nacatamales are rotated top to bottom - bottom to top to facilitate even cooking.\n\nNacatamales can also be made pindongo (with no pork) for religious reasons like the Nicaraguan-Jewish community or with no chile, for people with sensitive stomachs.\n"}

{"id": "1789184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1789184", "title": "Complement (linguistics)", "text": "Complement (linguistics)\n\nIn grammar, a complement is a word, phrase or clause that is necessary to complete the meaning of a given expression. Complements are often also arguments (expressions that help complete the meaning of a predicate).\n\nThere are indicative as well as non-indicative complements in languages. Non-indicative complements follow the appropriate complementizers. Indicative complements do not follow complementizers but instead are included with special markers and clauses.\n\nIn many non-theoretical grammars, the terms \"subject complement\" and \"object complement\" are employed to denote the predicative expressions (such as predicative adjectives and nominals) that serve to assign a property to a subject or an object:\n\nThis terminology is used in grammar books:\nHowever, this use of terminology is avoided by many modern theories of syntax, which typically view the expressions in bold as part of the clause predicate, which means they are not complements of the subject or object but rather are properties that are predicated of the subject or object.\n\nThe Cambridge Grammar of the English Language assigns the term \"predicative complement\" to both uses and shifts the terminological distinction to the verb:\n\nIn many modern grammars (for instance in those that build on the X-bar framework), the object argument of a verbal predicate is called a complement. In fact, this use of the term is the one that currently dominates in linguistics. A main aspect of this understanding of complements is that the subject is usually not a complement of the predicate:\n\nWhile it is less common to do so, one sometimes extends this reasoning to subject arguments:\n\nIn those examples, the subject and object arguments are taken to be complements. In this area, the terms \"complement\" and \"argument\" thus overlap in meaning and use. Note that this practice takes a subject complement to be something very different from the subject complements of traditional grammar, which are predicative expressions, as just mentioned above.\n\nConstrued in the broadest sense, any time a given expression is somehow necessary in order to render another expression \"complete\", it can be characterized as a complement of that expression:\n\nConstrued in the broad sense, many complements cannot be understood as arguments. The argument concept is tied to the predicate concept in a way that the complement concept is not.\n\nIn linguistics, an adjunct is an optional, or structurally-dispensable, part of a sentence, clause, or phrase that, when it is removed, will not affect the remainder of the sentence except to discard from it some auxiliary information. A more detailed definition of the adjunct emphasizes its attribute as a modifying form, word, or phrase that depends on another form, word, or phrase, being an element of clause structure with adverbial function. An adjunct is not an argument or a predicative expression, and an argument is not an adjunct. The argument-adjunct distinction is central in most theories of syntax and semantics. The terminology used to denote arguments and adjuncts can vary depending on the theory at hand. Some dependency grammars, for instance, employ the term circonstant (instead of adjunct) and follow Tesnière (1959).\n\n"}

In some traditions, they are conceived as an aspect of deity. Although the number of tattvas varies depending on the philosophical school, together they are thought to form the basis of all our experience. The Samkhya philosophy uses a system of 25 tattvas, while Shaivism recognises 36 tattvas. In Buddhism, the equivalent is the list of dhammas which constitute reality.\n\nJain philosophy can be described in various ways, but the most acceptable tradition is to describe it in terms of the Tattvas or fundamentals. Without knowing them one cannot progress towards liberation. According to major Jain text, Tattvarthsutra, these are:\n\n\nEach one of these fundamental principles are discussed and explained by Jain Scholars in depth. There are two examples that can be used to explain the above principle intuitively.\n\n\nThis simple scenario can be interpreted as follows:\n\n\nIn Buddhism the term \"dhamma/dharma\" is being used for the constitutional elements. Early Buddhist philosophy used several lists, such as namarupa and the five skandhas, to analyse reality. The Abhidhamma tradition elaborated on these lists, using over 100 terms to analyse reality.\n\nThe Samkhya philosophy regards the Universe as consisting of two eternal realities: \"Purusha\" and \"Prakrti\". It is therefore a strongly dualist philosophy. The \"Purusha\" is the centre of consciousness, whereas the \"Prakriti\" is the source of all material existence. The twenty-five tattva system of Samkhya concerns itself only with the tangible aspect of creation, theorizing that \"Prakriti\" is the source of the world of becoming. It is the first tattva and is seen as pure potentiality that evolves itself successively into twenty-four additional tattvas or principles.\n\nIn Kashmir Shaivite philosophy, the tattvas are inclusive of consciousness as well as material existence. The 36 tattvas of Shaivism are divided into three groups:\n\nWithin Puranic literatures and general Vaishnava philosophy \"tattva\" is often used to denote certain categories or types of being or energies such as:\n\n\nIn Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy there are a total of five primary tattvas described in terms of living beings, which are collectively known as the Pancha Tattva and described as follows:\n\nIn Hindu tantrism there are five tattvas creating global energy cycles of \"tattvic tides\" beginning at dawn with \"Akasha\" and ending with \"Prithvi\":\nEach complete cycle lasts two hours. \nThis system of five tattvas which each can be combined with another, was also adapted by the Golden Dawn (→Tattva vision).\n\nThe Siddha system of traditional medicine () of ancient India was derived by Tamil Siddhas or the spiritual scientists of Tamil Nadu. According to this tradition, the human body is composed of 96 constituent principles or tattvas. Siddhas fundamental principles never differentiated man from the universe. According to them, “Nature is man and man is nature and therefore both are essentially one. Man is said to be the microcosm and the Universe is Macrocosm, because what exists in the Universe exists in man.”\n\nTattvas are the 96 qualities or properties of human body according to Akilattirattu Ammanai, the religious book of Ayyavazhi.\n\n\n"}

The prime use is to evaluate progress and weaknesses within the team involved.\n\nAssault courses are used in military training to increase fitness, to demonstrate techniques that can be used for crossing very rough terrain, and to increase teamwork and self-confidence.\n\nOften military assault courses will be standardised, and will have, for example (in the UK), a six-foot and a ten-foot wall, a climbing net, some type of bar to climb over, and a high rope or net that must be crossed (these being or representing the most likely difficult terrain that a soldier will come across). The standardisation means that every course will be to the same quality, though it also means that there will be certain parts that may be familiar if practised.\n\nHowever, they have different purposes. For example, they can be short (less than a minute) with a range on the end (e.g. Junior Leaders, Folkestone), or long (five minutes) as at Thetford. This is partially because of space restraints and training objectives. The short one can be run as an individual course and a warmup for the range. The long Thetford course is more of an exercise in endurance and teamwork.\n\nThe term \"trim trail\" has also been applied to a series of wooden exercise stations, scattered in parkland or other locations beside a jogging or walking trail, which can be used to develop balance, strength and coordination.

It originated in Yorkshire at least as early as the 19th century.\n\nFat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream. An 1859 Charles Dickens story identifies the fat rascal with the singing hinny of Northumberland. A fat rascal could also be baked as a turf cake, a buttery, flat cake baked in a covered pan among the ashes of a peat fire, and the terms \"fat rascal\" and \"turf cake\" are sometimes used interchangeably. A Yorkshire cookery book of 1973 had plain flour, baking powder, butter and currants as the ingredients. A 1980 Yorkshire cookbook described fat rascals as a means of using leftover pastry, typically consisting of scraps of shortcrust pastry, sugared, sprinkled with currants and rolled into thick flat cakes before baking. Fat rascals, whatever their composition, do not appear to have been widely known outside the Yorkshire region until the 1980s, although there are occasional mentions in other regions, such as in Rye, Sussex in Ford Madox Ford's 1931 memoirs.\n\nThere is a recipe for fat rascals in a book called \"The Presidents' Cook Book\" by Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks published in 1968 by Funk and Wagnalls in the USA. \nThey say \"In Edith Roosevelt's most cherished cook book ... is this recipe for hot biscuits.\" This cook book now rests on a shelf in the parlour of Sagamore Hill.\n\nA widely recognised version of the fat rascal was introduced by Bettys Café Tea Rooms in North Yorkshire in 1983.

For instance, members of the Grand Council were called \"Coohai nashūn-i amban\" () in Manchu and Qing governor-generals were called \"Uheri kadalara amban\" ().\n\nThe word \"amban\" was transcribed into Chinese as ().\n\nBy far the most known ambans were the Qing imperial residents (Manchurian: \"Seremšeme tehe amban\"; ; and Tibetan: \"Ngang pai\") in Tibet, Qinghai, Mongolia and Xinjiang, which recognized Qing authority, but were not governed as regular provinces and retained many of their existing institutions.\nThe Qing imperial residents can be roughly compared to a European resident in a protectorate (e.g. a British Indian princely state), the real rapport depending on historical circumstances rather than a general job description for every amban, while his authority often was very extensive, rather like a provincial governor.\n\nThe Qing Emperor appointed an amban in Tibet (), who represented Qing authority over the Buddhist theocracy of Tibet, and commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa. The chief amban was aided by an assistant amban () and both of them reported to the Qing Lifan Yuan. Their duties included acting as intermediary between China and the Hindu kingdom of Nepal (Ghorkhas Country); a secretary () dealt with native affairs. Three Chinese commissioners (), of the class of sub-prefects, were stationed at Lhasa, Tashilumbo and Ngari. \nThe Qing imperial resident in Tibet was introduced in 1727 and most ambasa were appointed from the Manchu Eight Banners, a few were Han Chinese or Mongol. The Emperors used ambasa to supervise Tibetan politics, and the Qianlong, Jiaqing and Daoguang Emperors each decreed that the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama were bound to follow the leadership or guidance of the ambasa in carrying out the administration of Tibet.\n\nZhao Erfeng, a Han Chinese Bannerman, was appointed as Amban of Tibet by the Qing government. He was killed during the Xinhai Revolution by Chinese Republican Revolutionary forces intent on overthrowing the Qing dynasty. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu Amban Lien Yu and his Chinese soldiers were expelled from Lhasa.\n\nAltishahr, meaning six cities, consisted of Uyghur cities of Yarkand, Kashgar, Khotan, Kuche, Aksu, and Yangi Hisar (or Ush-Turfan). The Qing dynasty's wars with the Zunghar Khanate pushed them into the area and by 1759 they had obtained control of this region. After the rebellion of Yakub Beg, Altishahr was incorporated into the administration of Xinjiang, which became a formal province in the Qing empire in 1884. Between 1761 and 1865, the Qing Empire appointed an imperial resident (Manchu: \"hebei amban\"; Chinese: \"zǒnglǐ huíjiāng shìwù cānzàn dàchén\" 總理回疆事務參贊大臣) to Altishahr, which today forms part of southern Xinjiang.

The imperial resident was controlled with local imperial agents (Manchu: \"Baita icihiyara amban\"; Chinese: \"Bànshì dàchén\" 辦事大臣), who were sent to most important cities in the region, where they ruled in conjunction with the local officials (Uighur:ھاكىمبەگ \"hakim beg\", Chinese: 阿奇木伯克), who were given ranks in the Qing civil service and were ultimately accountable to the imperial agent.\n\nIn the holy city of Urga, an amban (Mongol: Хүрээний амбан ноён, Chinese: 庫倫辦事大臣 \"Kùlún bànshì dàchén\") was stationed in order to assert Qing control over the Mongol dependencies. He controlled all temporal matters, and was specially charged with the control of the frontier town of Kiakhta and the trade conducted there with the Russians. Urga was also the residence of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, who was the spiritual head of the Mongol Khalkha tribes. The Khutuktu ranked third in degree of veneration among the dignitaries in the Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama. He resided in a sacred quarter on the western side of the town and acted as a spiritual counterpart of the Qing amban.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Manchu amban was expelled by Mongol forces, fleeing to China proper via Russia.\n\nIn the early Qing, the word \"amban\" was also used in the title of the military governors (昂邦章京, \"angbang-zhangjing\", which is a transcription of the Manchu \"amban-jianggin\"; R.L. Edmonds translates the title in English as \"military deputy-lieutenant governor\") in the northeastern provinces of the Qing Empire, viz. Jilin and Heilongjiang. The first \"amban-jianggin\" appointed in the region was the Ninguta garrison commander Sarhuda, who became the \"amban-jianggin\" of Ninguta in June 1653.\n\n\n"}

Some Chinese people take the flakes with bitter Chinese herbal medicine.\n\nTraditionally some parents believed haw flakes to be capable of deworming children of digestive tract parasites.\n\nGourmet haw flakes are also available at specialty Chinese markets in the West. Gourmet haw flakes tend to be larger than the regular Shandong haw flakes (gourmet haw flakes are about 35–40 mm in diameter where as the Shandong haw flakes are about 25 mm in diameter.)\n\nLow sugar and additive free haw flakes aimed towards the health conscious are readily available in China but less so in the West.

The \"sujeo\" set includes a pair of oval-shaped or rounded-rectangular metal (often stainless steel) chopsticks, and a long handled shallow spoon of the same material. One may use both at the same time, but this is a recent way to speed eating. It is not considered good etiquette to hold the spoon and the chopstick together in one hand especially while eating with elders. More often food is eaten with chopsticks alone. Sometimes the spoon apart from chopsticks is referred to as \"sujeo\".\n\nChopsticks may be put down on a table, but never put into food standing up, particularly rice, as this is considered to bring bad luck since it resembles food offerings to at a grave to deceased ancestors. The spoon may be laid down on the rice bowl, or soup bowl, if it has not been used. As food is eaten quickly, and portions are small, little time is spent in putting eating utensils down.\n\nCases for \"sujeo\" in paper or Korean fabrics were often embroidered with symbols of longevity and given as gifts, particularly at weddings.

An authentic Cullen skink will use finnan haddie, but it may be prepared with any other undyed smoked haddock.\n\nThis soup is a local speciality, from the town of Cullen in Moray, on the northeast coast of Scotland. The soup is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners. Cullen skink is widely served as an everyday dish across the northeast of Scotland.\n\nLocal recipes for Cullen skink have several slight variations, such as the use of milk instead of water or the addition of single cream. Other variations include mashing the potatoes to make the soup thicker. Cullen skink was traditionally served with bread.\n\nIt has been described as \"smokier and more assertive than American chowder, heartier than classical French bisque.\"\n\nCullen skink appears in many traditional Scottish cookery books and appears in numerous restaurants and hotel menus throughout Scotland, the UK, and internationally. In 2012 a \"Guardian\" columnist described the dish as \"the milky fish soup which has surely replaced your haggises and porridges as Scotland's signature dish\".\n\n\"Skink\" is a Scots word for a shin, knuckle, or hough of beef, which has developed the secondary meaning of a soup, especially one made from these.

{"id": "1795705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795705", "title": "Street food", "text": "Street food\n\nStreet food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth, food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classed as both finger food and fast food, and are cheaper on average than restaurant meals. According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day.\nToday, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as convenience, to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, to try ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia.\n\nSmall fried fish were a street food in ancient Greece; however, Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low regard. Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was discovered during the excavation of Pompeii. Street food was widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes did not have ovens or hearths. Here, chickpea soup with bread and grain paste were common meals. In ancient China, street food generally catered to the poor, however, wealthy residents would send servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their homes.\n\nA traveling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and fritters that they had purchased from street vendors. In Renaissance Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling \"fragrant bites of hot meat\", including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted. In 1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and standardize street food.\n\nAztec marketplaces had vendors who sold beverages such as \"atolli\" (\"a gruel made from maize dough\"), almost 50 types of tamales (with ingredients that ranged from the meat of turkey, rabbit, gopher, frog and fish to fruits, eggs and maize flowers), as well as insects and stews. Spanish colonization brought European food stocks like wheat, sugarcane and livestock to Peru, however, most commoners continued to primarily eat their traditional diets. Imports were only accepted at the margins of their diet, for example, grilled beef hearts sold by street vendors. Some of Lima's 19th-century street vendors such as \"Erasmo, the 'negro' sango vendor\" and Na Aguedita are still remembered today.\n\nDuring the American Colonial period, \"street vendors sold oysters, roasted corn ears, fruit, and sweets at low prices to all classes.\" Oysters, in particular, were a cheap and popular street food until around 1910 when overfishing and pollution caused prices to rise. Street vendors in New York City faced a lot of opposition. After previous restrictions had limited their operating hours, street food vendors were completely banned in New York City by 1707. Many women of African descent made their living selling street foods in America in the 18th and 19th centuries, with products ranging from fruit, cakes, and nuts in Savannah, to coffee, biscuits, pralines, and other sweets in New Orleans. Cracker Jack started as one of many street food exhibits at the Columbian Exposition.\n\nIn the 19th century, street food vendors in Transylvania sold gingerbread-nuts, cream mixed with corn, as well as bacon and other meat fried on top of ceramic vessels with hot coals inside. French fries, consisting of fried strips of potato, probably originated as a street food in Paris in the 1840s. Street foods in Victorian London included tripe, pea soup, pea pods in butter, whelk, prawns, and jellied eels.\n\nStreet food culture in China was first developed in the Tang Dynasty and continued to evolve over millennia. Street food continues to play a major role in Chinese cuisine with regional street food generating a strong interest in culinary tourism. Because of the Chinese diaspora, Chinese street food has had a major influence on other cuisines across Asia and even introduced the concept of a street food culture to other countries. The street food culture of Southeast Asia was established by coolie workers imported from China during the late 19th century.\n\nRamen, originally brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants about 100 years ago, began as a street food for laborers and students. However, it soon became a \"national dish\" and even acquired regional variations.\n\nIn Thailand, street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand but it did not become popular among native Thai people until the early 1960s, because of rapid urban population growth, by the 1970s it had \"displaced home-cooking.\" The rise of the country's tourism industry is also contributed to the popularity of Thai street food.\n\nIn Indonesia — especially Java, travelling food and drink vendor has a long history, as they were described in temples bas reliefs dated from 9th century, as well as mentioned in 14th century inscription as a line of work. During colonial Dutch East Indies period circa 19th century, several street food were developed and documented, including satay and \"dawet\" (cendol) street vendors. The current proliferation of Indonesia's vigorous street food culture is contributed by the massive urbanization in recent decades that has opened opportunities in food service sectors. This took place in the country's rapidly expanding urban agglomerations, especially in Greater Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya.\n\nStreet food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly between regions and cultures. For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being \"fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area\" and \"draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime\", while street food of Thailand is \"fiery\" and \"pungent with shrimp paste ... and fish sauce.\" New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, however, New York street food also includes everything from \"spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles\"\n\nStreet food in Thailand offers various selection of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks sold by hawkers or vendors at food stalls or food carts on the street side. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best place for street food. Popular street offerings includes \"pad thai\" (stir fried rice noodle), \"som tam\" (green papaya salad), sour \"tom yum\" soup, various selection of Thai curries, to sticky rice mango\n\nIndonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese, and Dutch influences. Indonesian street food often tastes rather strong and spicy. A lot of street food in Indonesia are fried, such as local \"gorengan\" (fritters), also \"nasi goreng\" and \"ayam goreng\", while \"bakso\" meatball soup, skewered chicken satay and \"gado-gado\" vegetable salad served in peanut sauce are also popular.\n\nIndian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every region has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes are Vada Pav, Cholle Bhature, Parathas, Rolls, Bhel Puri, Sev Puri, Gol Gappa, Aloo tikki, Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, Samosa, Bread omelette, Pav bhaji and Pakora. In India, street food is popularly known as \"nukkadwala\" food. There are several restaurants and QSRs in India that have also taken their inspiration from the vibrant street food of India.\nIn Hawaii, the local street food tradition of \"plate lunch\" (rice, macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the \"bento\" of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers. In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passersby to purchase sausages and hot dogs.\n\nIn Egypt, a food sold commonly on the street is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish.\n\nMexican street food is known as \"antojitos\" (translated as \"little cravings\") which include several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al pastor, huaraches and other maize based foods\n\nBecause of differences in culture, social stratification and history, the ways in which family street vendor enterprises are traditionally created and run vary in different areas of the world. For example, few women are street vendors in Bangladesh, but women predominate in the trade in Nigeria and Thailand. Doreen Fernandez says that Filipino cultural attitudes towards meals is one \"cultural factor operating in the street food phenomenon\" in the Philippines because eating \"food out in the open, in the market or street or field\" is \"not at odds with the meal indoors or at home\" where \"there is no special room for dining\".\n\nWalking on the street while eating is considered rude in some cultures, such as Japan or Swahili cultures, although it is acceptable for children. In India, Henrike Donner wrote about a \"marked distinction between food that could be eaten outside, especially by women,\" and the food prepared and eaten at home, with some non-Indian food being too \"strange\" or tied too closely to non-vegetarian preparation methods to be made at home.\n\nIn Tanzania's Dar es Salaam region, street food vendors produce economic benefits beyond their families. Because street food vendors purchase local fresh foods, urban gardens and small-scale farms in the area have expanded. In the United States, street food vendors are credited with supporting New York City's rapid growth by supplying meals for the city's merchants and workers. Proprietors of street food in the United States have had a goal of upward mobility, moving from selling on the street to their own shops. However, in Mexico, an increase in street vendors has been seen as a sign of deteriorating economic conditions in which food vending is the only employment opportunity that unskilled labor who have migrated from rural areas to urban areas are able to find.\n\nIn 2002, Coca-Cola reported that China, India, and Nigeria were some of its fastest-growing markets: markets where the company's expansion efforts included training and equipping mobile street vendors to sell its products.\n\nAs early as the 14th century, government officials oversaw street food vendor activities. With the increasing pace of globalization and tourism, the safety of street food has become one of the major concerns of public health, and a focus for governments and scientists to raise public awareness. However, despite concerns about contamination at street food vendors, the incidence of such is low, with studies showing rates comparable to restaurants.\n\nIn 2002, a sampling of 511 street foods in Ghana by the World Health Organization showed that most had microbial counts within the accepted limits, and a different sampling of 15 street foods in Calcutta showed that they were \"nutritionally well balanced\", providing roughly 200 kcal (Cal) of energy per rupee of cost.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Food Standards Agency provides comprehensive guidance of food safety for the vendors, traders and retailers of the street food sector. Other effective ways of enhancing the safety of street foods include: mystery shopping programs, training, rewarding programs to vendors, regulatory governing and membership management programs, and technical testing programs.\n\nDespite knowledge of the risk factors, actual harm to consumers’ health is yet to be fully proven and understood. Due to difficulties in tracking cases and the lack of disease-reporting systems, follow-up studies proving actual connections between street food consumption and food-borne diseases are still very few. Little attention has been devoted to consumers and their eating habits, behaviors and awareness. The fact that social and geographical origins largely determine consumers’ physiological adaptation and reaction to foods—whether contaminated or not—is neglected in the literature.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the United Nations and other organizations began to recognize that street vendors had been an underused method of delivering fortified foods to populations, and in 2007, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization recommended considering methods of adding nutrients and supplements to street foods that are commonly consumed by the particular culture.\n\n"}

{"id": "1800287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800287", "title": "Shoe polish", "text": "Shoe polish\n\nShoe polish (or boot polish) is a waxy paste, cream, or liquid used to polish, shine, and waterproof leather shoes or boots to extend the footwear's life, and restore, maintain and improve their appearance.\n\nShoe polish can be classified into three types: wax, cream-emulsion, and liquid. Each differs in detailed composition but all consist of a mixture of waxes, solvent, and dyes. \n\nWaxes, organic solvents, and dyes compose this type of polish. Waxes are 20–40% of the material. Natural waxes include carnauba and montan as well as synthetic waxes. The composition is determined by a balance of hardness and polishing properties after solvent has evaporated. Solvents are selected to match the waxes. About 70% of shoe polish is solvent. A variety of solvents are used including naphtha. Turpentine, although more expensive, is favored for its \"shoe polish odor\". Dyes make up the final 2–3% of the polish. A traditional dye is nigrosine, but other dyes (including azo dyes) and pigments are used for oxblood, cordovan, and brown polishes. \n\nOwing to its high content of volatile solvents, wax-based shoe polish hardens after application, while retaining its gloss. Poorly blended polishes are known to suffer from blooming, evidenced by the appearance of a white coating of stearin on the polish surface.\n\nThese polishes may have a gelatinous consistency. They are composed of the usual three components waxes, liquid vehicle, and dyes. Unlike wax-based shoe polishes, cream-emulsions contain water and/or oil plus a solvent (either naphtha, turpentine or Stoddard Solution), so the liquid content is high. Emulsifiers and surfactants are required. These include ammonia, morpholine and various ethoxylated surfactants such as polysorbate 80. The waxes are often some mixture of carnauba wax, beeswax, montan wax and its oxidized derivatives, and paraffin waxes.\n\nLiquid shoe polish is sold in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content. Liquid shoe polish is a complex mixture. Polyethylene wax emulsion is a major component. Various polymers, typically acrylates, are the next major component, conferring gloss and holding the dyes in suspension. Resins and casein are selected to ensure adhesion to the leather. Fatty phosphate esters, emulsifiers, and glycols are also used. Pigments include titanium dioxide for whites and iron oxides for browns. Although liquid polish can put a fast shine on shoes, many experts warn against its long-term use because it can cause the leather to dry out and crack.\n\nThe process for producing shoe polish is straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).\n\nShoe polish is manufactured in large thermostated, stirred reactors. Steps are taken to ensure that volatile solvents do not evaporate. Typically, low-melting paraffin wax is melted, followed by the higher melting waxes, and finally the colorant-stearate mixture. The molten mass is added to warm solvent before being dispensed. Wax-based shoe polish is traditionally packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes. When dried due to solvent loss or other reasons, the hardened wax pulls away from the walls of the container giving what is known as a \"rattler\".\n\nFrom medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, was used to soften and waterproof leather; but it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century many forms of shoe polish became available, yet were rarely referred to as \"shoe polish\" or \"boot polish\". Instead, they were often called \"blacking\", especially when mixed with lampblack, or still were referred to as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.\n\nIn London the Warren brothers, Thomas and Jonathan, started making blacking around 1795–98, initially in partnership and then with competing companies. Jonathan Warren's Blacking company is noted as the first employer of the young Charles Dickens aged 12 in 1823. The competitor to the Warren companies in London is the Day & Martin company formed in 1801.\n\nDetails of the operation of Day & Martin in 1842 reveal that the blacking they produced was in two forms, bottled liquid, and a thick paste which was available in either small wide-mouthed stone tubs, slabs wrapped in oiled paper, or in \"circular tin-boxes, about three inches in diameter, and half or three-quarters of an inch thick\". Tinned blacking paste was at this time exclusively for army use. The text states, \"Yet, as the soldier’s boots or shoes must to some extent emulate the brightness and glitter of the boots of those who pay for battles instead of fighting them, a portable blacking apparatus is provided.\" This confirms the tins as polish rather than dubbin.\n\nIn 1832, James S. Mason of Philadelphia began the commercial production of shoe blacking and inks. In 1851, James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking were labeled as Mason Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 and the building was razed in 1973.\n\nOther early leather preserving products included the Irish brand \"Punch\", which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English man by the name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and dubbin under the brand name Wren's. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of Wren's quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, Erdal, went on sale in 1901.\n\nPrior to 1906, shoe polish was not well known as a purchasable product, nor was it particularly sophisticated. While sales were not especially high, a few brands, like \"Nugget\", were available in the UK during the 19th century. The practice of shining people’s shoes gradually caught on and soon many shoeshine boys in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth.\n\nThe first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, Kiwi, and Wren's. An advertisement published in March 1947 by Wren's claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was Kiwi; Scottish expatriates William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making \"boot polish\" in a small factory in 1904 in Melbourne, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Black and a range of colors became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the Sara Lee Corporation since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to SC Johnson.\n\nRamsay named the shoe polish after the kiwi, the national bird of New Zealand; Ramsay's wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, was a native of Oamaru, New Zealand. It has been suggested that, at a time when several symbols were weakly associated with New Zealand, the eventual spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the kiwi's popular appeal and promoted it at the expense of the others.\n\nA rival brand in the early years was \"Cobra Boot Polish\", based in Sydney. Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in \"The Sydney Bulletin\", starting in 1909, using a character called \"Chunder Loo of Akim Foo.\" \"Chunder\" is Australian slang for vomit, and possibly originated through the rhyming slang of \"Chunder Loo\" and spew (another slang word for vomit).\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, leather shoes and boots became affordable to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need in the market for a product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. The polish was also used to shine leather belts, handgun holsters, and horse tack. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including \"Shinola\" and \"Cavalier\" (United States), \"Cherry Blossom\" (United Kingdom), \"Parwa\" (India), \"Jean Bart\" (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. In the German documentary of 1927 \"\", a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a black person.\nShoe manufacturing improvements in the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to a surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.\n\nShoe polish was to be found just about everywhere Allied troops ventured. American war correspondent Walter Graeber wrote for \"TIME\" magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that \"old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay side by side with empty bottles of Chianti.\" A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out.\n\nWhen the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces arrived in Japan—all with boots polished to a degree not known in the U.S. forces—the G.I.s were more conscious than ever of their feet. The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish, but in the superior Australian boot polish, a commodity which was soon exchanged with the Americans on a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish.\n\nSoldiers returning from the war continued to use the product, leading to a further surge in its popularity. While Kiwi shoe polish was what business historian Alfred D. Chandler, Jr. would call a \"first mover\", Kiwi did not open a manufacturing plant in the US until after World War II. Prior to this, Cavalier Shoe Polish, founded by James Lobell, had operated in the US since 1913. The sales paradigm of Cavalier polish was to have footwear professionals sell Cavalier's high-end shoe polish to the shoe-buying public. A few years after World War II, Kiwi opened a manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, making only black, brown, and neutral shoe polish in tins. Kiwi purchased Cavalier in 1961, and continued to manufacture products under the name until the year 2000.\n\nShoe polish products are low-value items that are infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months for even the most frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.\n\nThere are numerous branded products available, as well as generic store brands. There are two chief areas of shoe polish sales: to the general public, and to specialists and trade, such as shoe repairers, and cobblers. The sales percentages between the two outlets are roughly comparable. The best selling, low-cost brands are produced by these companies: Kiwi, Tana, and Johnson, and Reckitt & Colman. Approximately 60 million units are sold annually. Other leading brands include Kelly's, Shinola, Lincoln Shoe Polish, Meltonian, Angelus, Woly, Salamander, Collonil and Cherry Blossom. \n\nKiwi was acquired by the American company Sara Lee following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand Esquire Shoe Polish in 1987. The Federal Trade Commission ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a monopoly. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior approval. The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. \n\nIn recent years, there has been a rise in popularity of high-end shoe polishes, such as Saphir made by Avel and Boot Black made by Columbus.\n\nShoe polish is applied to the shoe using a rag, cloth, brush, or with bare fingers. Shoe polish is not a cleaning product: it is suited for clean and dry shoes. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as \"spit-polishing\" or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This action achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a \"spit shine\" or \"bull\" which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. Polishes containing carnauba wax can be used as a protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.\n\nShoe polish may be purchased pre-soaked into a hard sponge, which can be used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an \"applicator\". \n\nMany products are closely related to shoe polish, but not strictly considered as such. Other chemical products may be used to clean and shine shoes—in particular whiteners for white shoes, and a variety of sprays and aerosols for cleaning and waterproofing suede shoes. A banana peel can also be used to effectively shine shoes, but it is not recommended.\n\nAlthough shoe polish is primarily intended for leather shoes, some brands specify that it may be used on non-porous materials, such as vinyl. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be \"neutral\", lacking any intrinsic colour.\n\nShoe polish is such a niche market that its environmental impact is negligible. Solvent evaporation is one issue. Dyes and pigments with \"severe carcinogenic profiles\" have been removed from most formulations.\n\n\n"}

Balls are formed and then rolled in nib sugar, shredded coconut, or sprinkles. The Oatmeal ball can be eaten immediately, but it is usually first chilled in a refrigerator. \n\nBecause of its simple recipe, it can be quickly made by anyone and is popular at children's parties and as homemade candy.\n\nA similar confectionary, made with Petit Beurre crumbs rather than oatmeal, is popular in Israel where it is called כדור שוקולד \"Kadur Shokolad\", meaning \"chocolate ball\".\n\nThe Oatmeal ball was most likely invented during World War II, in Denmark, where because of the rationing, there was a limited supply of wheat flour, which caused many to look for substitutes. In 1943, Nationaltidende published a small booklet for housewives called \"Ingenuity in a time of crisis\" (), wherein the recipe for \"havregrynskugle\" was found.\n\nOne traditional name for the pastry in Swedish is \"negerboll\" (negro ball). Due to possible racist connotations, this name has fallen out of favor in recent decades, with \"chokladboll\" (chocolate ball) now being the most commonly used name. When made with shredded coconut, it is also known as \"kokosboll\" (coconut ball). The term \"kokosboll\" has been in use longer than the term \"negerboll\".\n\nThe appropriateness of \"negerboll\" as the name of the pastry has been the subject of media debate, intensified by \"neger\" now generally being considered an ethnic slur, having undergone a similar change in tone to English \"negro\". \"Chokladboll\" was first added to the Swedish Academy's glossary Svenska Akademiens ordlista in 2006, with only \"negerboll\" being listed prior. In the 13th (2006) edition, the pastry can be found under both names, with a comment that \"chokladboll\" is the recommended term. In the 14th edition (2015) \"negerboll\" was removed.\n\nIn mid-2003, a bakery owner from Sjöbo was reported to the Swedish Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination for using the word \"negerboll\" on a sign in her bakery shop. However, the case was dismissed since the person reporting it did not consider herself personally insulted.\n\nNote that the Danish word \"negerbolle\" is a similarly-dated term for a different confection, namely the flødebolle.\n\n\n"}

The Texas toast loaf itself is often more squarish compared to most sliced breads which have a more curved side and top. While Texas toast bread can be used in the same manner as ordinary bread slices such as in sandwiches, it is especially useful for dishes involving liquids, such as barbecue sauce, or where extra thickness could improve the product, such as French toast. In addition, the often increased thickness of the slices of Texas toast lets it retain moisture and softness better than regular sliced bread. It is usually a white bread although there are whole wheat varieties. Producers of Texas toast in the United States include Franz Bakery, Mrs. Baird's, and Safeway/Lucerne Foods.\n\nPopular in Texas and its bordering states, Texas toast is often served as a side with southern-style dishes such as chicken fried steak, fried catfish, or BBQ. Texas toast can also be used when making toasted sandwiches.\n\nThe actual toast itself is made by putting butter or margarine on both sides of the bread and broiling or grilling it until it is a lightly golden brown. Depending on the recipe, the spread may contain seasonings including garlic, yielding a form of garlic bread. The toast may include cheese on one or both sides, similar to an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nThe best-selling varieties of Texas toast are frozen breads, sold with a garlic or garlic and cheese spread which is applied immediately after baking. The best selling brands are the New York Brand of the T. Marzetti Company, Pepperidge Farm, and Coles.\n\nSome recipes suggest regular or thick-sliced bread be cooked in a frying pan alongside fried steak, bacon, or other meat product in order to absorb the grease from the meat (cf. fried bread).\n\nAlthough not sold or labeled as Texas toast, sliced bread throughout Japan is normally the same thickness as Texas toast and is used for making pizza toast.\n\nOne claimant to the invention of Texas toast is the Kirbys Pig Stand restaurant chain, founded in Oak Cliff, a neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, in the early 1920s. The once-thriving chain, whose heyday in the 1940s saw over 100 locations across the United States, also claims to be the originator of the onion ring. Texas toast may have been first created in 1946 at the Pig Stand in Denton, Texas, after a bakery order for thicker slices of bread resulted in slices too thick for the toaster and a cook, Wiley W. W. Cross, suggested buttering and grilling them as a solution. Another Pig Stand cook in Beaumont, Texas claimed he created the idea of grilling the bread. W.W.W. Cross is also credited for combining the Texas toast with chicken fried steak to create Kirby's Pig Stand's famous Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich.\n\n"}

{"id": "1809954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809954", "title": "Majesty", "text": "Majesty\n\nMajesty (abbreviation \"HM\" for \"Her/ His Majesty\", oral address \"Your Majesty\") is an English word derived ultimately from the Latin \"maiestas\", meaning \"greatness\", and used as a style by many monarchs, usually kings or sultans. Where used, the style outranks the style of \"(Imperial/Royal) Highness\", but is inferior to the style of \"Imperial Majesty\". It has cognates in many other languages, especially Indo-European languages of Europe.\n\nOriginally, during the Roman republic, the word \"maiestas\" was the legal term for the supreme status and dignity of the state, to be respected above everything else. This was crucially defined by the existence of a specific case , called \"laesa maiestas\" (in later French and English law, \"lèse-majesté\"), consisting of the violation of this supreme status. Various acts such as celebrating a party on a day of public mourning, contempt of the various rites of the state and disloyalty in word or act were punished as crimes against the majesty of the republic. \nHowever, later, under the Empire, it came to mean an offence against the dignity of the Emperor.\n\nThe term was first assumed by Charles V, who believed that—following his election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519—he deserved a style greater than \"Highness\", which preceding emperors and kings had used. Soon, Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England followed his example.\n\nAfter the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, Majesty was used to describe a monarch of the very highest rank— it was generally applied to God. Variations, such as \"Catholic Majesty\" (Spain) or \"Britannic Majesty\" (United Kingdom) are often used in diplomatic settings where there otherwise may be ambiguity (see a list).\n\nA person with the title is usually addressed as \"Your Majesty\", and referred to as \"His/Her Majesty\", abbreviated \"HM\"; the plural \"Their Majesties\" is \"TM\". Emperors (and empresses) use \"[His/Her/Their/Your] Imperial Majesty\", \"HIM\" or \"TIM\".\n\nPrincely and ducal heads usually use \"His Highness\" or some variation thereof (e.g., \"His Serene Highness\"). In British practice, heads of princely states in the British Empire were referred to as Highness.\n\nIn monarchies that do not follow the European tradition, monarchs may be called \"Majesty\" whether or not they formally bear the title of \"King\" or \"Queen\", as is the case in certain countries and amongst certain peoples in Africa and Asia.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, several derivatives of Majesty have been or are used, either to distinguish the British sovereign from continental kings and queens or as further exalted forms of address for the monarch in official documents or the most formal situations. Richard II, according to Robert Lacey in his book Great Tales from English history, was the first English King to demand the title of 'Highness' or 'Majesty.' He also noted that, '...previous English Kings had been content to be addressed as \"My Lord\" '.\n\n\"Most Gracious Majesty\" is only used in the most formal of occasions. Around 1519 King Henry VIII decided Majesty should become the style of the sovereign of England. \"Majesty\", however, was not used exclusively; it arbitrarily alternated with both \"Highness\" and \"Grace\", even in official documents. For example, one legal judgement issued by Henry VIII uses all three indiscriminately; Article 15 begins with, \"The Kinges Highness hath ordered,\" Article 16 with, \"The Kinges Majestie\" and Article 17 with, \"The Kinges Grace.\" \n\nPre-Union Scotland Sovereigns were only addressed as \"Your Grace\". During the reign of James VI and I, Majesty became the official style, to the exclusion of others. In full, the Sovereign is still referred to as \"His (Her) Most Gracious Majesty\", actually a merger of both the Scottish Grace and the English Majesty.\n\n\"Britannic Majesty\" is the style used for the monarch and the crown in diplomacy, the law of nations, and international relations. For example, in the Mandate for Palestine of the League of Nations, it was \"His Britannic Majesty\" who was designated as the Mandatory for Palestine. Britannic Majesty is famously used in all British passports, where the following sentence is used:\n\"Most Excellent Majesty\" is mainly used in Acts of Parliament, where the phrase \"The King's (or Queen's) Most Excellent Majesty\" is used in the enacting clause. The standard is as follows:\n\nIn Empire of China, an honorific () of Emperor of China () only.\n\nIn Japan, an honorific () of Reigning Emperor () only.\n\nIn Brunei, a Malay title for the Sultan of Brunei is officially \"Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda\" (KDYMMPSB) or unofficial simply \"Kebawah Duli\". It literally means \"Under the dust of the Most Exalted [God], The Victorious Sovereign\". \n\nIt reflects the title of \"Zilullah-fil-Alam\" (\"Shadow of God on Earth\"), referring to the Sultan as having a small bit of God's immense power. The title \"paduka\" means \"victorious\" from Old Malay while \"seri\" is an honorific from Sanskrit. The title \"baginda\" is a third-person noun for royals and prophets.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Malay style for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Raja Permaisuri Agong is \"Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda\" or simply \"Seri Paduka Baginda\". The Sultan of Johor and the Permaisuri of Johor use the Malay style \"Duli Yang Maha Mulia\" (DYMM) which is equivalent to His/Her Majesty since 2017. Prior to that, they were addressed as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in English, similar with the other eight royal state Malay rulers in Malaysia.\n"}
{"id": "1810291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1810291", "title": "Assamese cuisine", "text": "Assamese cuisine\n\nAssamese cuisine () is the cuisine of Assam. It is a style of cooking that is a confluence of cooking habits of the hills that favor fermentation and drying as forms of preservation and those from the plains that provide fresh vegetables and an abundance of fish and meat. Both are centered on the main ingredient — rice. The confluence of varied cultural influences in the Assam Valley has led to the staggering variety and flavours in the Assamese food. It is characterised by the use of an extremely wide variety of plant as well as animal products, owing to their abundance in the region. It is a mixture of indigenous styles with considerable regional variations and some external influences. \n\nThe cuisine is characterized by very little use of spices, little cooking over fire and strong flavors due mainly to the use of endemic exotic fruits and vegetables that are either fresh, dried or fermented. Fish is widely used, and birds like duck, squab etc. are very popular, which are often paired with a main vegetable or ingredient. Preparations are rarely elaborate. (The practice of bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients so common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam.) The preferred oil for cooking is the pungent mustard oil.\nA traditional meal in Assam begins with a \"khar\", a class of dishes named after the main ingredient, and ends with a \"tenga\", a sour dish. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils made by an indigenous community called Mariya. The belief is that when food and water is served in such utensils its good for health and boost up immunity. \"Tamul\" (betel nut, generally raw) and \"paan\" generally concludes the meal.\n\nThough still obscure, this cuisine has seen wider notice in recent times. The discovery of this cuisine in the popular media continues, with the presenters yet to settle on the language and the specific distinctiveness to describe it.\n\nRice is the most important ingredient in this cuisine. The large varieties of rice found in the region has led to speculation that the grain was first domesticated in the Assam-Yunnan region. Both the indica as well as the japonica varieties are grown in Assam. The most popular class of rice is the \"joha\" or scented rice. As a staple, rice is eaten either steam boiled (\"ukhua\") or sundried (\"aaroi\"). Some very fine quality of rice namely, \"Karaballam\" or \"kauribadam\" etc., are available in Assam only.\n\nRice is eaten as snack in many forms: roasted and ground (\"xandoh\"), boiled in its husk and flattened (\"chira\"), puffed (\"akhoi\"). (\"kumol saul\"), a preparation of rice that is precooked, dried and then husked can be simply soaked in warm water and eaten as a light meal.\n\nRice is a part of all meals in Assam. A traditional breakfast consists of \"chira\" with yogurt and jaggery. Mostly farmers eat cooked rice soaked overnight (\"poita\") simply accompanied with salt, mustard oil, onions, etc. Snacks are \"xandoh\", \"kumol saul\" or \"bora saul\", sticky rice, which can be eaten with sweet or salty accompaniments. For other major meals, rice could be boiled, steamed or wrapped in leaves and roasted. 'Sunga Saul' is a special preparation in which (sticky) rice (\"bora saul\") is cooked in bamboo hollows called 'sunga'. 'Sewa diya Bhaat' is another preparation where sticky rice is steamed over boiling water. They are generally served with meat or fish. Sticky rice is also wrapped in leaves, usually plantain leaves or \"tora pat\", and dropped into boiling water to prepare 'tupula bhat'.\n\nA special class of rice preparations, called pithas are generally made only on special occasions like the Bihu. Made usually with soaked and ground glutinous rice (bora saul), they could be fried in oil with a sesame filling (\"xutuli pitha\"), roasted in young green bamboo over a slow fire (sunga pitha) or baked and rolled over a hot plate with a filling (\"kholasaporia pitha\").\n\nThe next most important ingredient is fish, harvested from the many rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. The extremely wet climate and the large numbers of water bodies has ensured that large varieties of fresh water fish are available in abundance in the valley. It is a staple item in the Assamese palate. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for pisciculture. Some of the most popular big fishes are the \"Borali\" (freshwater dhark), \"rou\", and \"cital\" (big), \"khoria\" (medium) (Chitala chitala), \"maagur\", Xingi, \"borali\", \"bhokua\" or \"bahu\", \"Xaal\", \"Xol\", etc. The small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam like \"puthi\", \"Ari\" (long-whiskered catfish), \"Goroi\" (green snake head/ spotted snake head ), \"Koi\" or \"Kawoi\" (climbing perch \"Anabas testudineus\"), \"Kholihona\" (Indian paradise fish \"Ctenops nobilis\") \"borolia\", \"mua\", \"ceniputhi\", \"tengera\", \"lachin\", \"bhangun\", \"pabho\", etc. The discerning gourmet can tell which region of Assam is known for which variety of fish. \n\nThe \"mas tenga\" (sour fish ), which is commonly eaten by most communities of Assam, has lately turned into a signature dish of Assamese cuisine. The most popular souring agent for the \"tenga\" is tomatoes, though ones made with \"kajinemu\" juice (thick skinned elongated lemon) and \"thekera\" (dried mangosteen,) are also popular.\n\nThe most common way of eating fish in traditional Assamese homes is by preparing a stew with herbs, vegetables, and greens as per preference and availability. Fish is also prepared by roasting or char-grilling. A favorite is a small fish roasted in banana leaves (\"paatotdia\"). \"Hukoti\" is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish like (\"puthi maas\") pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of northeast India in general and Assam in particular. Dried and fermented small fish \"puthy mas\" (Ticto barb), three to four in number, are roasted with lavish amounts of green chilis, tomatoes, ginger and garlic (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice. Fish eggs and innards are also cooked and consumed.\n\n\nThe Assamese meat and fish dishes are characterized by a low amount of spices and oil, higher quantity of ginger, noroxinghow paat (curry leaves), Khorisa (fermented bamboo shoot) and lemon juice, and differ completely in taste from the dishes of neighboring Bengal. Local Chicken, Venison, Squab, Mutton, Duck and Pork is very popular among the indigenous ethnic tribal Assamese communities like Sonowals, Bodo, Rabha, etc. Upper caste Assamese Hindus, such as Assamese Brahmins(including Ganaks) and Kayasthas of Assam, Kalitas of Lower Assam refrain from pork consumption. Beef is occasionally consumed by Assamese Muslims, although they traditionally refrain from consuming pork. The Christians, many ethnic communities, and the non religious sections consume all types of meat.\n\nThe basic cooking methods include cooking, shallow and deep frying. \"Onla\", of the Bodos, is made with ground rice and special herbs and constitutes a complete meal in itself. Other meats include squab, duck, chicken, goat meat, venison, and turtle although venison and turtle meat are legally prohibited. The combination of duck/white gourd and squab/papaya or\nbanana flower is very popular. Meat is generally stewed using limited spices as well as a choice of herbs and vegetables.\n\nMost communities of Assam are entomophagous. Ethnic tribes of certain areas partake of the silkworm, water bugs, grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried or cooked or roasted in leaves and then prepared according to the timing of the meal. The red ant egg is considered a delicacy during the Rongali Bihu festival.\n\nThe environs of Assam are rich in vegetation, and green leafy vegetables, called \"xaak\", are an important part of the cuisine. Some of them are grown while others like the \"dhekia\" (fern) grows wild. There is a bewildering variety that is eaten and according to custom, one has to have 101 different \"xaak\" (greens) during Rongali Bihu. Herbs, greens, and vegetables are commonly eaten by simply cooking in water and salt, lightly frying, as a thick soup or by adding to varieties of lentils. They are also prepared in combination with fish, meat and eggs.\n\nAmong spices there are ginger, garlic, onion, cumin seed, black cumin, black pepper, chilli, turmeric, coriander seed, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, fenugreek seed, white mustard seed, aniseed, Malabar leaf, Cumin, etc. Some herbs peculiar to Assam are \"maan dhaniya\", \"moran Ada\", \"madhuhulong\", \"bhedai lota\", \"manimuni\", \"masundari\" etc. An Assamese meal is incomplete without green chilis, many varieties of which are available in the region. Assam is famous for the bhut jolokia or \"ghost pepper\" which was recognized as the hottest chili in the world. \"Panch-furan (mixture of 5 spices)\" is used for adding flavour to Dal.\n\nAlthough modern cuisine of Assam has been influenced by east and north Indian cuisine, Assam is still rich in traditional dishes. \n\nThe khar is a signature class of preparations made with a key ingredient, also called khar. The traditional ingredient is made by filtering water through the ashes of the sun-dried skin of a few varieties of banana , which is then called \"kola khar\" (The name derived from the local term for banana, \"kol\" or \"kola.\") A traditional meal invariably begins with a \"khar\" dish, which can be prepared with raw papaya, mustard leaves, vegetables, pulses, fish or any other main ingredient.\n\nXôkôta is a severely bitter type of preparation. It is prepared with dry jute leaf, urad bean and \"khar\". However, the combination of \"khar\" (alkaline) and \"tenga\" (acidic) is not recommended. The liquid khar is also simply eaten as \"kharoli\" with rice which is prepared by adding a few drops of mustard oil. Assamese people have a peculiar tradition of eating a large variety of bitter dishes, many of which are considered delicacies. Some dishes in this category include, \"fresh bamboo shoot\", cooked or lightly fried, \"cane shoot\", Neem leaves fried, \"titabhekuri\", bitter gourd, \"Xukuta\", \"Titaphool\", \"Sewali Phool\" etc.\n\nThe \"masor tenga\" is a light and sour fish dish, another signature class of preparations. There are numerous ways of preparing the sour fish curry among Assamese people. The souring ingredient could be mangosteen, lemon, etc., but the most popular is made with tomatoes. Fish dishes made with fermented bamboo shoot (khorisa) are generally sour, but they are not called \"tenga\". Fish is fried in mustard oil or stewed with bottle gourd or spinach. Another \"tenga\" dish is prepared with \"matimah\" (urad bean) and \"outenga\" (elephant apple). Bottle gourd can be added to it. \"Tengamora\" or \"noltenga\" and lentil is a distinct \"tenga\" curry.\n\nThe \"narasingh masor jhol\" is another authentic dish from Assam.The fishes are cooked in a light gravy of curry leaves which is a common aromatic herb used in southern and some northern parts of India. The curry leaves are also known as noro-shingho paat in Assamese. The fish preparations in Assam emphasize on retaining the natural flavors of the fishes and hence few spices are used.\n\nPura refers to various forms of grilled and roasted food. Vegetables, meat and fish are often served in this form. Aalu bengena pura pitika, pura maas pitika (mashed grilled fish), pura mankho etc. are a few of the popular dishes.\n\n\"Poitabhat\" is a favourite dish in Assam during the summer season. Cooked rice is soaked overnight and left to ferment. It is and served with mustard oil, onion, chili, pickles, \"pitika\" (mashes), etc. The 'poitabhat' preparation is sometimes made alcoholic according to preference.\n\nSide dishes called \"pitika - পিটিকা\" (mashes) is a signature characteristic of this cuisine. The most popular is \"aloo pitika - আলু পিটিকা\" (mashed potatoes) garnished with raw onions, mustard oil, green chillies and sometimes boiled eggs. \"Khorisa tenga\" is mashed fermented bamboo shoot, sometimes pickled in mustard oil and spices. \"Kharoli\" is fermented mashed mustard (\"Brassica campestris\" var. toria) seed to which a \"khar\" has been added, and \"kahudi\" to which an acidic agent (lemon juice, dried mangosteen) has been added. \"Pitika\"s are also made from roasted or steamed vegetables (tomatoes and eggplants being very popular). Small fish, asiatic pennywort, \"matikaduri\", \"tengamora\" leaves, heartleaf, \"dôrôn\" (\"Leucus longifolia\"), etc. are roasted separately wrapped in banana leaves and mashed into 'pitika'.\n\nPickles are made of mango, indian gooseberry, hog plum, Indian olive, Tamarind, star fruit, mangosteen, radish, carrot, elephant apple, Indian jujube, chili, lime, garlic, etc. Panitenga and kharoli are signature Assamese pickles made from ground mustard seeds.\n\nChutney is made of coriander, spinach, tomato, heartleaf, curry leaf, chilli, lentil, chickpea etc. \"Xukan masor chutney\" (chutney made of dried fish) is popular among the tribal communities. Salad is made of carrot, radish, tomato, cucumber, beetroot, etc.\n\n'Bora' are fried balls of mashed lentil or gram — it is equivalent to vada in few other Indian languages. It may contain other green leafy vegetable locally called 'xaak' within it, and it is best while served with 'teteli' (tamarind) curry or dip. There is a huge variety of 'bora' preparations in Assamese cuisine. The base ingredients include greens, vegetables, fruits, flowers, skin, and shoots of various plants.

The Panache River is a tributary of the east bank of the Wetetnagami River flowing into Senneterre in the La Vallée-de-l'Or Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, in Quebec, in Canada.\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", the main character's ubiquitous perfume is called 'L'air de Panache'.\n\n"}

As of August 2014, the second generation is marketed in South Korea, Russia, China, United States, Canada, Central America, and South America — as well as in the Middle East under the Hyundai Centennial nameplate. \n\nThe name \"\"equus\"\" is the Latin word for \"horse\".\n\nOn November 4, 2015, Hyundai officially announced the Genesis brand will be spun off into Genesis Motor, the new luxury vehicle division for Hyundai. The 2016 successor to the Hyundai Equus will be rebranded as Genesis G90 (EQ900 in Korea, but until 2018) The Equus currently serves as the official state car of the Republic of Korea.\nIn 1999, Hyundai Motors and Mitsubishi Motors presented their full-size sedan. Hyundai said that it was making a full-size sedan to compete with Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series in the Korean market. In reality, it was competing against its domestic rival, the SsangYong Chairman. Hyundai had great success with the Equus in Korea, but very few were exported to other countries. One was exported for the 2001 New York International Auto Show to gauge the reaction of U.S. consumers. Hyundai identified the car to the U.S. consumers as the Hyundai LZ450 luxury sedan but it was not sold in the United States. \n\nThe first generation was designed by Mitsubishi Motors, who had their own version called the Proudia. It was jointly manufactured by both companies. The first-generation model was introduced in 1999 as a front-wheel-drive car measuring long and wide. A long-wheelbase limousine model was available exclusively for the Korean domestic market, and at ₩92,510,000 South Korean won for the 2008 model with a V8 and no options, was the most expensive model in the company's lineup. The first-generation Equus extended-length limousine was also mechanically related to the Mitsubishi Dignity limousine for the Japanese market. The first-generation Equus were sold in South Korea, China, and the Middle East. A very limited number, badged as the Centennial, were made available for some western European markets in the early and mid-2000s. At first, there were two engine types: a 3.5 Sigma V6 and 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine. After a few months, the 3.0 Sigma V6 engine type was added. Two versions were available: a sedan (3.0, 3.5 and 4.5) and a limousine (3.5 and 4.5). In Japan, under the name of Mitsubishi Dignity (limousine version) and Mitsubishi Proudia (sedan version), about 2,000 units were sold. Specifically, the 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine was a GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) type engine, which was designed and developed by Mitsubishi Motors. This engine was optimized for premium unleaded gasoline fuel, but there was little opportunity to get this type of fuel in Korea at that time. So, most of these engines used normal unleaded gasoline fuel and then had significant performance issues, resulting in complaints from drivers. Finally, Hyundai Motors modified this engine from a GDI Type to a MPI (Multi Point Injection) type to solve the issue. It added curtain airbags in 2001 and active head restraints in 2002. \n\nIn 2003, Hyundai presented their 'New Equus', changing the hood design and some of interior. A 7 inch screen for the rear seat, Xenon headlamps, front parking sensors, etc. were newly offered. It introduced seat ventilation cooling and heating, climate control with air purifier (2003), Alcantara leather seats (2007). From 2005, 3.0 and 3.5 Sigma V6 engine types were changed to 3.3 and 3.8 Lambda V6 engine types which were designed and developed by Hyundai Motors. But the automatic transmission was not changed. Hyundai officially ceased the production of 1st generation Equus in November 2009. A new bigger, rear-wheel drive Equus was launched in March 2009. Instead of continuing production like Hyundai, Mitsubishi Motors ended the production of the Proudia and the Dignity around the time of the introduction of this model.\n\nA limousine model was made for the Korean market. Equus Limousines have been used by famous company owners in Korea as well as foreign VIPs.\n\nThe second generation Equus, codename \"VI\", was unveiled in Grand Hyatt Seoul. Unlike the old Equus, the VI has a rear-wheel drive architecture, a longer wheelbase, and a different engine. The VI is based on an all-new platform, that has been entirely developed by Hyundai Motor Corporation. Although the car has nothing in common with the previous Equus, the VI takes only the name from old Equus, because the name 'Equus' has prestige in Korea.\n\nThe Korean domestic market Equus comes as a 3.8L \"Prime\" and a 4.6L \"Prestige\" in South Korea. It is the most expensive model in the company's lineup. It launched in the People's Republic of China in August 2009. The Hyundai Equus was listed in the '10 exciting cars for 2010' from \"Forbes\".\n\nUS model was announced in 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and was unveiled in 2010 New York Auto Show. Early US model includes the same 4.6L V8 engine as the Genesis except with more than the current version. This puts the total engine output at with . The North American Equus features a badge attached on the hood as opposed to the hood ornament, the grille features a horizontal grid pattern like its Genesis sibling as opposed to the vertical one on international models, and an included iPad device with an Equus user's guide application pre-installed as opposed to a traditional owner's manual.\n\nIt was the first Hyundai with an Electronically-controlled Air Suspension (EAS) and Continuous Damping Control (CDC). Also first Hyundai with Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) collision avoidance system that optimally manages Electronic stability control, the electronic parking brake, radar smart cruise control and the seatbelt tensioning system for optimal safety.\n\nThe long-wheelbase version Equus was unveiled in September 2009. It is longer than the sedan version. Engine choices include Lambda 3.8L and Tau 5.0L engines. The limousine model has an exclusive horizontal cross-bar radiator grille, as well as features such as a power-driven footrest, rear-seat leg support and a massage system.\n\nHyundai also developed an armoured vehicle based on the limousine, with an enlarged 5.5L version of the V8 engine. On September 2009, Hyundai delivered three bulletproof limousine versions of the luxury sedan Equus to the South Korea Presidential Security Service to be used as the official state car. Hyundai designed this vehicle with a special alloy, with an automatic cooling system in case of fire as well as bulletproof windows.\n\nThe first-built armoured limousine was donated to Blue House. A modified Hyundai Equus was donated to Costa Rica and is currently used as the presidential car.\n\nThe limousine was available only in South Korea and Russia. The Russian version had the same price tag as the South Korean version.\n\nIt is a concept vehicle customized by Rhys Millen Racing, based on Equus with 4.6 Tau engine. It included bolt-on RMR Signature Edition air intake and stainless exhaust, increased engine power by 30 hp, RMR Signature Edition embroidered headrests and floor mats, and ostrich hide leather seats with suede accents.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2010 SEMA show.\n\nIt is a version of 2011 Equus sedan built by Mummbles Marketing and DUB Magazine.

Some recipes also add flour, such as corn flour, oats flour or cassava flour. It is typical of the Brazilian Caipira cuisine and most present in the countryside of southeastern states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, being either manufactured or home-made. It is also very common during the Festa Junina, an annual festivity that celebrates the caipira lifestyle. It is known for its distinct dry texture and sweet taste, and is one of the most beloved Brazilian candies.\n\nPaçoca in its present form was invented during the Colonial Brazil Period, but Native Brazilian peoples had recipes that mixed cassava flour with other ingredients prior to colonization. Those recipes were modified by the settlers, creating the current combination that uses sugar.\n\nThe name \"paçoca\" comes from the Tupi word \"posok\" (pronounced /pɔsɔk/) which means \"to crumble\" or \"to shatter,\" and is shared with the salty Paçoca dish. Both are a mix of cassava flour with other ingredients: peanut and sugar in the case of the sweet, and carne-de-sol (\"sun-dried-beef\") for the salty dish. Both dishes seem to have originated from the same Native Brazilian customs, but have grown to be completely different products\n\nThe traditional artisanal process of making paçoca involves first roasting the peanuts, then grinding all the ingredients together using a traditional Mortar (\"pilão\"). In more modern manufacturing techniques, instead of a mortar, industrial blenders are used, and the Paçocas are later pressed into many shapes, most commonly square or cork shapes.\n\nSome companies have created variations from the traditional Paçoca recipe, which include a diet version, with no sugar added, and a higher peanut concentration.\n\n"}

Amuse-bouches are different from appetizers in that they are not ordered from a menu by patrons but are served for free and according to the chef's selection alone. These, often accompanied by a complementary wine, are served both to prepare the guest for the meal and to offer a glimpse of the chef's style.\n\nThe term is French and literally means \"mouth amuser\". The plural form may be \"amuse-bouche\" or \"amuse-bouches\".\nIn France, is traditionally used in conversation and literary writing while \"amuse-bouche\" is not even listed in most dictionaries, being a euphemistic hypercorrection that appeared in the 1980s on restaurant menus and used almost only there. (In French, \"bouche\" refers to the human mouth, while \"gueule\" may mean the mouth or snout of an animal, though commonly used for \"mouth\" and derogatory only in certain expressions.)\n\nThe amuse-bouche emerged as an identifiable course during the nouvelle cuisine movement, which emphasized smaller, more intensely flavoured courses. It differs from other \"hors d'œuvres\" in that it is small, usually just one or two bites, and preselected by the chef and offered free of charge to all present at the table.\n\nThe function of the amuse-bouche could be played by rather simple offerings, such as a plate of olives or a crock of tapenade. It often becomes a showcase, however, of the artistry and showmanship of the chef, intensified by the competition among restaurants. According to Jean-Georges Vongerichten, a popular New York celebrity chef with restaurants around the world, \"The amuse-bouche is the best way for a great chef to express his or her big ideas in small bites\".\n\nAt some point, the amuse-bouche transformed from an unexpected bonus to a \"de rigueur\" offering at Michelin Guide-starred restaurants and those aspiring to that category (as recently as 1999, \"The New York Times\" provided a parenthetical explanation of the course). This in turn created a set of logistical challenges for restaurants: amuse-bouche must be prepared in sufficient quantities to serve all guests, usually just after the order is taken or between main courses. This often requires a separate cooking station devoted solely to producing the course quickly as well as a large and varied collection of specialized china for serving the amuse. Interesting plates, demitasse cups, and large Asian-style soup spoons are popular choices. In addition, the kitchen must try to accommodate guests that have an aversion or allergy to ingredients in the \"amuse\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1813325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1813325", "title": "Sriracha sauce", "text": "Sriracha sauce\n\nSriracha (, ; ) is a type of hot sauce or chili sauce made from a paste of chili peppers, distilled vinegar, garlic, sugar, and salt. The Huy Fong Foods Sriracha was first produced in the early 1980s for dishes served at American Pho restaurants.\n\nIn Thailand, Sriracha is frequently used as a dipping sauce, particularly for seafood. In Vietnamese cuisine, Sriracha appears as a condiment for \"phở\", fried noodles, a topping for spring rolls (\"chả giò\"), and in sauces.\n\nSriracha is also eaten in soup, on eggs and burgers. Jams, lollipops, and cocktails have all been made using the sauce, and Sriracha-flavored potato chips have been marketed.\n\nThe origin and history of Sriracha is debated. One report has it that the sauce was first produced by a Thai woman named Thanom Chakkapak in the town of Si Racha (or Sri Racha). According to the Thai \"Chomrom Rak Si Racha\" (The Si Racha Lovers' Association) the sauce was first made in Si Racha by Burmese sawmill workers. The association interviewed 88-year-old Thawat Wiphisamakun, known locally as Ah Pae. Ah Pae's maternal grandmother had a small shop in Si Racha. The Burmese workers came to the shop to buy chilies, salt, vinegar, and sugar to pound in a mortar to make their sauce. Eventually she started making the sauce herself, both for family use and for sale to customers. Soon, another customer, Kimsua Thimkrachang, began to buy large quantities of chilies, salt, vinegar, and sugar. He was making the chili sauce for sale as Sauce Si Racha Traa Phukhao Thong (Golden Mountain Brand Si Racha Sauce) with a picture of the Golden Mountain Temple on the label. Its name was Si Racha Phanich.\n\nAnother report has it that the sauce originated in the town of Sri Racha (Sri Racha, Sriracha), Thailand in the early 1930s by Madam La Orr Suwanprasop. La Orr was born and raised in Sri Racha and eventually met her husband who was from Bangkok. Upon getting married she and her husband moved to Bangkok where she would continuously make batches of the famous chili sauce for her friends. Her friends would encourage her to make the sauce for sale which ultimately motivated her to start her sriracha sauce business.\n\nAfter discussing with a monk, La Orr was given the blessing to start the sriracha chili sauce business. The monk had given her the idea to name the sauce Sriracha Sauce, after her hometown. By 1932, Madam La Orr Suwanprasop began producing and selling her sauce in Bangkok. Over time, the rumor of her sauce began to spread and chefs all over Bangkok started using her sauce in their restaurants. La Orr and her family eventually entered their sauce into annual competitions where she was awarded several gold medals which is why their Sriracha sauce is named the Gold Medal Brand.\n\nAfter winning various medals and recognition for their sauce, La Orr and her family eventually brought their medals to the government food department in Bangkok to establish that they are the original creators of “Sriracha Sauce”. By this time, it was very difficult for the government to prove that they were the original creators of the famous sauce as there were several other “copycat” brands but there are no records showing that the sauce was made before 1932. The food department recommended that they change their logo’s design so that it incorporates wording in both Thai and Buddhist translating to “Produced in 1932” which became a strong indicator to tell that the Gold Medal brand was the first and oldest of the Sriracha sauce brands. Today, Lakut Suwanprasop, son of Madam La Orr Suwanprasop, still follows the traditions of his mother in creating and selling the Sriracha sauce from fresh, well-inspected chilis.\n\nDifferent brands use different ingredients.\n\nIn Thailand, the sauce is most often called \"sot Siracha\" () and only sometimes \"nam phrik Siracha\" (). Traditional Thai Sriracha sauce tends to be tangier in taste, and runnier in texture than non-Thai versions.\n\nIn a \"Bon Appétit\" magazine interview, US Asian-foods distributor Eastland Food Corporation asserted that the Thai brand of hot sauce \"Sriraja Panich\", which Eastland distributes, is the original \"Sriracha sauce\" and was created in Si Racha, Thailand, in the 1930s from the recipe of a housewife named Thanom Chakkapak.\n\nWithin the United States, Sriracha is associated with a sauce produced by Huy Fong Foods and is sometimes referred to as \"rooster sauce\" or \"cock sauce\"\n\nVarious restaurants in the US, including Wendy's, Applebee's, P.F. Chang's, Jack in the Box, McDonald's, Subway, Taco Bell, White Castle, Gordon Biersch, Chick-fil-a, Firehouse Subs, Noodles & Company, Starbucks and Burger King have incorporated Sriracha into their dishes, sometimes mixing it with mayonnaise or into dipping sauces. Blue Diamond, a leading producer of almond products, markets a Sriracha flavor alongside their other flavors. The word \"Sriracha\" is considered a generic term.\n\nIn 2013, American filmmaker Griffin Hammond released \"Sriracha\", a documentary about the origin and production of Sriracha sauce.\n\n"}

It is made with roast beef on a kummelweck roll, topped with kosher salt and caraway seed. The meat on the sandwich is traditionally served rare, thin cut, with the top bun getting a dip in au jus and spread with horseradish.\n\nThe origin and history of the beef on weck sandwich is not well established. It is believed that a German baker named William Wahr, who is thought to have immigrated from the Black Forest region of Germany, created the kummelweck roll while living in Buffalo, New York. Wahr may have based the kummelweck roll on a special loaf left as a ceremonial offering for the dead known in Swabia as \"Schwäbische Seele\", which is a thin roll resembling a baguette that is topped with salt and caraway seeds. The sandwich's creation is estimated to have taken place some time in the mid-19th century, according to Charlie Roesch, a local butcher of renown in Western New York.\n\nA local pub owner is said to have used the roll to create the beef on weck, with the thought that the salty top of the roll would encourage his patrons to purchase more drinks.\n\nThe kummelweck roll (sometimes spelled \"kümmelweck\"), topped with kosher salt and caraway seeds, gives the sandwich its name and a distinctive taste. \"Kümmel\" is the German word for caraway, and \"Weck\" means \"roll\" in the south-western German dialects of Palatinate, the Saarland, Baden and Swabia areas (northern Germans generally say \"Brötchen\"). However, the roll used for this American sandwich tends to be softer and fluffier than a standard German Kümmelbrötchen or Kümmelweck. In Austria, a similar type of small white-bread is known as \"Kümmelweckerl\" (diminutive from \"Wecken\", which refers to a whole big bread, i.e. \"Brotwecken\").\n\nA typical beef on weck is made from slow-roasted rare roast beef that is hand-carved in thin slices, served on a kummelweck roll. The cut face of the top half of the roll may be dipped in the jus from the roast. Prepared horseradish is usually provided for the diner to spread to taste on the top half of the roll.\n\nThe beef on weck has long been popular regionally, and has gained a following in other areas of the United States where it has been introduced. Expatriates from Western New York have taken the dish and brought it to other areas after relocating. For example, PJ's BAR-B-QSA in Saratoga Springs in Eastern New York is noted for its beef on weck. It has also been featured by chefs on cooking shows including the PBS special \"Sandwiches That You Will Like\". Bobby Flay, Anthony Bourdain and other chefs have featured the beef on weck, or a variant, on their television programs.\n\nThe American restaurant chain Buffalo Wild Wings was started by former residents of the Western New York area and the original name of the restaurant was \"Buffalo Wild Wings and Weck\", abbreviated as \"BW3\", the third W referring to weck. Some still refer to the company with the extra \"W\" in its abbreviation. The chain now serves an updated version of the beef on weck called the Thirty-Fifth Weck Sandwich.\n\n\"The Daily Meal\" reviewed the beef on weck as a \"roast beef sandwich that dreams are made of\" in their article \"12 Life-Changing Sandwiches You've Never Heard Of\".\n\n"}

A wide variety of liquorice sweets are produced around the world. In North America, black licorice is distinguished from similar confectionery varieties that are not flavoured and coloured black with liquorice extract but commonly manufactured in the form of chewy ropes or tubes. So called \"black licorice\" together with anise extract is also a widespread flavour in other forms of confectionery such as jellybeans. In addition to these, various other liquorice-based sweets are sold in the United Kingdom, such as liquorice allsorts. Dutch and Nordic liquorice characteristically contains ammonium chloride instead of sodium chloride, prominently so in salty liquorice.\n\nThe essential ingredients of liquorice confectionery are liquorice extract, sugar, and a binder. The base is typically starch/flour, gum arabic, gelatin or a combination thereof. Additional ingredients are extra flavouring, beeswax for a shiny surface, ammonium chloride and molasses. Ammonium chloride is mainly used in salty liquorice candy, with concentrations up to about 8%. However, even regular liquorice candy can contain up to 2% ammonium chloride, the taste of which is less prominent due to the higher sugar concentration. Some liquorice candy is flavoured with anise oil instead of or in combination with liquorice root extract.\n\nDuring manufacturing, the ingredients are dissolved in water and heated to . In order to obtain sweets of the desired shapes, the liquid is poured into molds that are created by impressing holes into a container filled with starch powder. The liquid is then dried and the resulting sweets are sprayed with beeswax to make their surface shiny.\n\nThe liquorice-root extract contains the natural sweetener glycyrrhizin, which is over 50 times sweeter than sucrose. This ingredient has various pharmaceutical properties. It acts as an expectorant (facilitating removal of mucus from the lungs by coughing) and it increases blood pressure. The latter effect can become significant with a daily consumption of 50 g or more of liquorice candy for as little as two weeks. Glycyrrhizin can cause potassium levels in the body to fall, triggering abnormal heart rhythms, as well as high blood pressure, edema (swelling), lethargy, and congestive heart failure in some people.\n\nLiquorice has several varied uses in herbal medicine, such as acting as a mild laxative by increasing prostaglandins.\n\nComparative studies of pregnant women suggest that excessive amounts of liquorice (100 g a week) may adversely affect both IQ and behaviour traits of offspring.\n\nSome people report that black liquorice confectionery causes their stools to become green, although this is probably due to the blue food colouring used by many manufacturers.\n\nAlexander the Great supplied his troops with rations of liquorice root whilst marching because of its thirst-quenching qualities.\n\nAn excessive amount of black liquorice consumption can cause a chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis.\n\nIn many countries there is also a product sometimes known as red liquorice which is extruded in a way to resemble liquorice strings but made with main flavourings other than liquorice, such as strawberry, cherry, raspberry, or cinnamon. More recently similar products have been introduced in a wider variety of colours and flavours including apple, mango, blackcurrant, and watermelon, among others. While the common name for this confectionery has now become \"red liquorice\" or often simply \"liquorice\", it does not have the taste of liquorice. \"Black\" in \"black liquorice\"/\"licorice\" would formerly have been redundant and has become a retronym in North America.\n\n\n"}

It is the local variety of the mille-feuille or Napoleon, introduced by an Amsterdam pastry baker and named after Admiraal Tom Pouce, the stage name of the Frisian dwarf Jan Hannema.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tompoes is iconic, and the market allows little variation in form, size and colour. It must be rectangular, with two layers of puff pastry. The icing is smooth and pink, or occasionally white. For many years however, the top layer has been orange on Koningsdag (King's Day), and a few days before. It may also be orange-coloured when the national football team plays in large international tournaments; this dates from about 1990. The filling is invariably sweet, yellow pastry cream. Tompouces are sometimes topped with whipped cream. Variations with different fillings or with jelly are comparatively rare and are not called tompoes. \n\nSeveral variations exist in Belgium. The \"boekske\" (\"lit.\" 'booklet') may have a sugar finish and may be square. Belgians also prefer the spelling \"tompouce\".\n\nThe cakes are usually served with tea or coffee, and in formal settings are eaten with pastry forks. But the hard biscuit-like layers, which squash the pastry cream when trying to cut a piece off, makes this difficult and messy, inspiring the humorous article \"Hoe eet je een tompoes?\" 'How do you eat a tompoes?'.\n\nAn easier, if slightly less dignified, way of eating a tompouce is to take the frosted top layer off the pastry and hold it one hand, with the bottom half in the other and then take sequential bites, one from the top and then one from the bottom. Even then, the whipped cream tends to squashed out onto the hand.\n\nThe name of Tom Poes, a cartoon character by Marten Toonder, is a play on Tompouce = Tom poes (tomcat).\n\n"}

They are called \"cellophane noodles\" or \"glass noodles\" because of their appearance when cooked, resembling cellophane, a clear material of a translucent light gray or brownish-gray color.\n\nCellophane noodles should not be confused with rice vermicelli, which are made from rice and are white in color rather than clear (after cooking in water).\n\nCellophane noodles are made from different starch. In China, cellophane noodles are usually made of mung bean starch. Chinese varieties made from mung bean starch are called Chinese vermicelli, bean threads, bean thread noodles. Thicker Korean varieties made with sweet potato starch are called sweet potato noodles or dangmyeon.\n\nCellophane noodles are available in various thicknesses. Wide, flat cellophane noodle sheets called mung bean sheets are also produced in China. In Korea, napjak-dangmyeon (literally \"flat \"dangmyeon\") refers to flat sweet potato noodles.\n\nIn China, the primary site of production of cellophane noodles is the town of Zhangxing, in Zhaoyuan, Shandong province. However, historically the noodles were shipped through the port of Longkou, and thus the noodles are known and marketed as Longkou \"fensi\" ().\n\nIn Chinese, the most commonly used names are \"fěnsī\" (, literally \"noodle thread\") and \"dōngfěn\" (, literally \"winter noodle\"). They are also marketed under the name \"saifun\", the Cantonese pronunciation of the Mandarin \"xìfěn\" (; literally \"slender noodle\"), though the name \"fánsī\" (粉絲) is the term most often used in Cantonese.\n\nIn China, cellophane noodles are a popular ingredient used in stir fries, soups, and particularly hot pots. They can also be used as an ingredient in fillings for a variety of Chinese \"jiaozi\" (dumplings) and \"bing\" (flatbreads), especially in vegetarian versions of these dishes. Thicker cellophane noodles are also commonly used to imitate the appearance and texture of shark's fin in vegetarian soups. Thicker varieties, most popular in China's northeast, are used in stir fries as well as cold salad-like dishes. A popular soup using the ingredient is fried tofu with thin noodles (; Pinyin: \"yóu dòu fu-xiàn fěn tāng\"). A popular Sichuan dish called \"ants climbing a tree\" consists of stewed cellophane noodles with a spicy ground pork meat sauce.\nIn Tibetan cuisine, glass noodles are called \"phing\" or \"fing\" and are used in soup, pork curry or with mushrooms.\n\nIn India and Pakistan, glass noodles are called \"falooda\" (see Falooda, the dessert dish), and are served on top of \"kulfi\" (a traditional ice cream). They are usually made from arrowroot starch using a traditional technique. The noodles are flavorless so they provide a nice contrast with the sweet \"kulfi\". \"Kulfi\" and \"falooda\" can be bought from numerous food stalls throughout Pakistan and northern parts of India.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, they are called \"soun\" or \"suun\".\n\nIn Japanese cuisine, they are called \"harusame\" (), literally \"spring rain\". Unlike Chinese glass noodles, they are usually made from potato starch. They are commonly used to make salads, or as an ingredient in hot pot dishes. They are also often used to make Japanese adaptations of Chinese and Korean dishes. \"Shirataki\" noodles are translucent, traditional Japanese noodles made from the konjac yam and sometimes tofu.\n\nIn Korean cuisine, glass noodles are usually made from sweet potato starch and are called \"dangmyeon\" (Hangul: ; Hanja: ; literally \"Tang noodles\"; also spelled \"dang myun\", \"dangmyun\", \"tang myun\", or \"tangmyun\"). They are commonly stir-fried in sesame oil with beef and vegetables, and flavoured with soy and sugar, in a popular dish called \"japchae\" (hangul: 잡채). They are usually thick, and are a brownish-gray color when in their uncooked form.\n\nIn Malaysia and Taiwan they are known as \"tanghoon\" (冬粉). People sometimes confuse them with \"bihun\" (米粉) which are rice vermicelli. Sometimes also known as suhun or suhoon.\n\nIn Filipino cuisine, the noodles are called a similar name: \"sotanghon\" because of the popular dish of the same name made from them using chicken and wood ears. They are also confused with rice vermicelli, which are called \"bihon\" in the Philippines.\n\nGlass noodles were introduced to Samoa by Cantonese agricultural workers in the early 1900s where they became known as \"\"lialia\"\", a Samoan word meaning \"to twirl\", after the method of twirling the noodles around chopsticks when eating. A popular dish called \"sapasui\" (transliteration of the Cantonese chop suey) is common fare at social gatherings. Sapasui, a soupy dish of boiled glass noodles mixed with braised pork, beef, or chicken and chopped vegetables, is akin to Hawaiian \"long rice\".\n\nIn Thai cuisine, glass noodles are called \"wun sen\" (). They are commonly mixed with pork and shrimp in a spicy salad called \"yam wun sen\" (), or stir-fried as \"phat wun sen\" ().\n\nIn Hawaii, where cuisine is heavily influenced by Asian cultures, cellophane noodles are known locally as long rice, supposedly because the process of making the noodles involves extruding the starch through a potato ricer. They are used most often in \"chicken long rice\", a dish of cellophane noodles in chicken broth that is often served at luaus.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, there are two varieties of cellophane noodles. The first, called \"bún tàu\" or \"bún tào\", are made from mung bean starch, and were introduced by Chinese immigrants. The second, called \"miến\" or \"miến dong\", are made from canna (), and were developed in Vietnam. These cellophane noodles are a main ingredient in the dishes: \"miến gà\", \"miến lươn\", \"miến măng vịt\", and \"miến cua\". These cellophane noodles are sometimes confused with rice vermicelli (Vietnamese: bún) and arrowroot starch noodles (Vietnamese: arrowroot: \"củ dong\", arrowroot starch: \"bột dong/bột hoàng tinh/bột mì tinh\").\n\nIn 2004, testing by Chinese authorities determined that some brands of cellophane noodles produced in Yantai, Shandong were contaminated with lead. It emerged that several unscrupulous companies were making their noodles from cornstarch instead of mung beans in order to reduce costs, and, to make the cornstarch transparent, were adding lead-based whiteners to their noodles. In December 2006, Beijing authorities again inspected cellophane noodles produced by the Yantai Deshengda Longkou Vermicelli Co. Ltd. in Siduitou village, Zhangxing town, Zhaoyuan city, Yantai, this time determining that sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, a toxic and possibly carcinogenic industrial bleach that is an illegal food additive in China, had been used in the production of the noodles. The company, which formerly sold its noodles both in China as well as overseas, was ordered to cease production and distribution.\n\nIn December 2010, Czech food inspection authorities (SZPI) again inspected Chinese cellophane noodles, this time determining that 142.00 mg/kg of aluminium had been used in the production of the noodles. Above 10 mg/kg is an illegal amount for noodles in Czech (and EU) markets, see Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 and its amendments (EU) No 187/2011, 618/2013 annex I.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1823150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1823150", "title": "Türbe", "text": "Türbe\n\nTürbe is the Turkish word for \"tomb\", and for the characteristic mausoleums, often relatively small, of Ottoman royalty and notables. It is related to the Arabic \"turbah\" تُرْبَة (meaning \"\"soil/ ground/ earth\"\"), which can also mean a mausoleum, but more often a funerary complex, or a plot in a cemetery.\n\nA typical türbe mausoleum is located in the grounds of a mosque or complex, often endowed by the deceased. However some are more closely integrated into surrounding buildings. They are usually relatively small buildings, often hexagonal or octagonal in shape, containing a single chamber, which may well be decorated with coloured tiles. A dome normally surmounts the building. They are normally kept closed, but the inside can be sometimes be glimpsed through metal grilles over the windows or door. The exterior is typically masonry, perhaps with tiled decoration over the doorway, but the interior often contains large areas of painted tilework, which may be of the highest quality.\n\nInside, the body or bodies repose in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a simple inscription, which are, or were originally, covered by rich cloth drapes. In general the sarcophagi are merely symbolic, and the actual body lies below the floor. At the head of the tomb in some examples a wooden pole was surmounted by a white cloth Ottoman turban (for men), or the turban could be in stone.\n\nEarlier examples often had two or more storeys, following the example of the Ilkhanate and Persian tombs on which the style was based; the Malek Tomb is a good example of these. The Ottoman style is also supposed to reflect the shape of the tents used by the earlier nomadic ottomans, and their successors when on military campaigns. Sultans often built their tombs during their lifetimes, although those of other family members, and some sultans, were built after their deaths. Sultan Murad I, assassinated just after his victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, has his türbe there, with his vital organs, while the rest was carried back to his capital at Bursa, where he has another türbe.\n\nThere are many famous \"türbes\" across Istanbul of the various sultans of the Ottoman Empire, as well as of other notables from Turkish history. \n\nThe Süleymaniye Mosque complex has some of the most famous, including that of Suleiman himself (1550s), perhaps the most splendid Ottoman \"türbe\", and that of his wife Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana), which has extremely fine tilework. Close by to the complex is the \"türbe\" of its famous architect Mimar Sinan, in what was his garden.\n\nKonya holds two earlier \"türbe\", with conical roofs, of the Seljuk Rum dynasty in the Alâeddin Mosque (12th century onwards), and the \"türbe\" of Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, which is a major shrine and pilgrimage point, just like the türbe of Gül Baba in Budapest, Hungary. Bursa, a capital of the earlier Ottomans before the conquest of Constantinople, holds the \"turbes\" of many of the earlier Ottoman Sultans including Osman I and his son, the Muradiye Complex containing Murad II and many princes, and the Yeşil Türbe of Mehmed I (died 1421). This is a large three-story tower, and the (false) sarcophagus itself is covered in tiles. Unusually, much of the exterior is covered with undecorated coloured tiles.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the heptagonal \"türbes\" of dervish saints such as Kıdlemi Baba, Ak Yazılı Baba, Demir Baba and Otman Baba served as the centers of Bektashi tekkes (gathering places) before 1826. The türbe of Haji Bektash Veli is located in the original Bektashi tekke (now a museum) in the town that now bears his name and remains a site for Alevi pilgrims from throughout Turkey.\n\nAt the peak of the Ottoman empire, under Gazi Husrev-beg Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, became the biggest and most important Ottoman city in the Balkans after Istanbul, with largest marketplace (modern days \"Baščaršija\"), and numerous mosques, which by the middle of the 16th century numbered more than 100. By 1660, the population of Sarajevo was estimated to be over 80,000. Husrev-beg greatly shaped the physical city, as most of what is now the Old Town was built during his reign. The Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque (Bosnian: Gazi Husrev-begova Džamija, Turkish: Gazi Hüsrev Bey Camii), is a mosque in Sarajevo historic marketplace Baščaršija, and it was built in 16th century. It is largest historical mosque in Bosnia and Herzegovina and one of the most representative Ottoman structures in the Balkans. Gazi Husrev-beg's turbe is located in the mosque courtyard.\n\nTravnik, in modern Bosnia and Herzegovina, became the capital of the Ottoman province of Bosnia and residence of the Bosnian viziers after 1699, when Sarajevo was set ablaze by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Grand Viziers were sometimes buried in Travnik, and türbe shrines were erected in their honour in the heart of Old town of Travnik, where they stand today.\n\n\n\n"}

The hot dog is topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices or wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt. The complete assembly of a Chicago hot dog is said to be \"dragged through the garden\" due to the many toppings. The method for cooking the hot dog itself varies depending on the vendor's preference. Most often they are steamed, water-simmered, or less often grilled over charcoal (in which case they are referred to as \"char-dogs\").\n\nThe canonical recipe does not include ketchup, and there is a widely shared, strong opinion among many Chicagoans and aficionados that ketchup is unacceptable. A number of Chicago hot dog vendors do not offer ketchup as a condiment. For National Hot Dog Day on July 19, 2017, Heinz created controversy by introducing ketchup, labeled as \"Chicago Dog Sauce\", to the disdain of many Chicagoans — but their effort also unearthed a minority of ketchup aficionados in the city.\n\nMany sources attribute the distinctive collection of toppings on a Chicago-style wiener to historic Maxwell Street and the \"Depression Sandwich\" reportedly originated by Fluky's in 1929. The founders of Vienna Beef frankfurters—the most common brand served today, first sold at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago—and the proprietors of Fluky's were both Jewish, which may account for the wieners' pork-free, kosher-style character.\n\nThe \"dragged through the garden\" style is heavily promoted by Vienna Beef and Red Hot Chicago, the two most prominent Chicago hot dog manufacturers, but exceptions are common, with vendors adding cucumber slices or lettuce, omitting poppyseeds or celery salt, or using plain relish or a skinless hot dog. Several popular hot dog stands serve a simpler version: a steamed natural-casing dog with only mustard, onions, plain relish and sport peppers, wrapped up with hand-cut french fries, while the historic Superdawg drive-ins notably substitute a pickled tomato for fresh. Many vendors offer a Chicago-style dog with cheese sauce, known as a cheese-dog. Boz Hot Dogs locations offer a unique nacho cheese sauce with pieces of jalapeño peppers.\n\nChicago-style hot dogs are cooked in hot water or steamed before adding the toppings. A less common style is cooked on a charcoal grill and referred to as a \"char-dog\". Char-dogs are easily identifiable because very often the ends of the dog are sliced in crisscross fashion before cooking, producing a distinctive cervelat-style \"curled-x\" shape as the dog cooks. Some hot dog stands, such as the Wieners Circle, only serve char-dogs.\n\nThe typical beef hot dog weighs 1/8 of a pound or and the most traditional type features a natural casing, providing a distinctive \"snap\" when bitten.\n\nThe buns are a high-gluten variety made to hold up to steam warming, typically the S. Rosen's Mary Ann brand from Alpha Baking Company.\n\nThe Chicago area has more hot dog restaurants than McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King restaurants combined. A \"hot dog stand\" in Chicago may serve many other items, including the Maxwell Street Polish, gyros, pork chop and Italian beef sandwiches, corn dogs, tamales, pizza puffs and Italian ice. The restaurants often have unique names, such as The Wieners Circle, Gene & Jude's, Gold Coast Dogs, Mustard's Last Stand or Morrie O'Malleys; or architectural features, like Superdawg's two giant rooftop hot dogs (Maurie and Flaurie, named for the husband-and-wife team that founded the drive-in).\n\n"}

They are manufactured by extruding heated corn dough through a die that forms the particular shape. They may be ball-shaped, curly (\"cheese curls\"), straight, or irregularly shaped. Puffcorn is a similar food, without cheese flavoring.\n\nCheese puffs were invented independently by two companies in the United States during the 1930s. \nAccording to one account, Edward Wilson noticed strings of puffed corn oozing from flaking machines in the mid 1930s at the Flakall Corporation of Beloit, Wisconsin, a producer of flaked, partially cooked animal feed. He experimented and developed it into a snack. Clarence J. Schwebke applied for an improved extruder patent in 1939 and the product, named \"Korn Kurls\", was commercialized in 1946 by the Adams Corporation, formed by one of the founders of Flakall and his sons. Adams was later bought by Beatrice Foods.\n\nAnother version was created by the Elmer Candy Corporation of New Orleans, Louisiana in 1936. The sales manager Morel M. Elmer, Sr., held a contest to name the new product \"CheeWees\". The trademark was lost when the candy company was sold in 1963, but the family's Elmer's Fine Foods continued to make the snack and repurchased the name in 1993.\n\nA fictitious brand of cheese puffs called \"Cheesy Poofs\" has appeared periodically in the animated television series \"South Park\". The Frito-Lay company produced a limited, promotional run of the snack in August 2011.\n\nA fictitious brand name, \"Cheezy Dibbles\", is a running joke in the 2014 film \"Penguins of Madagascar\".\n\n"}

It is used to prevent infections. As recently as 2018, there have been calls to remove neomycin from the product, and other competing products containing only polymyxin B and Bacitracin A are available.\nIn 2016 it was the 81st most prescribed medication in the United States with more than 9 million prescriptions.\n\nNeomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin ointment is reported to be a safe and effective topical agent for preventing infections in minor skin trauma.\n\nNeosporin is recommended for burns, scratches, cuts, and minor skin infections. It is most effective when the affected area is cleaned before the ointment is applied.\n\nThe use of triple-antibiotic ointments, such as neomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin, decreases infection rates in minor-contaminated wounds. However, if the wound is sterile, then there are no benefits compared to petrolatum.\n\nNeosporin is for external use only and should not be applied near mucous membranes such as the eyes or mouth. Neosporin is not recommended for children under the age of two. Neosporin has no known side effects; however, users should immediately seek medical attention if they experience hives, rashes, or itching. Any skin irritations such as pain, burning, or cracked skin that were not present prior to use of ointment must receive immediate care.\n\nConcern exists that the use of Neosporin contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In the US, the only large market for Neosporin, the ointment may promote the prevalence of MRSA bacteria, specifically the highly lethal strain. Neosporin has been shown to cause contact dermatitis in some cases, and may contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe original ointment contains three different antibiotics: bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B, in a relatively low-molecular-weight base of cocoa butter, cottonseed oil, sodium pyruvate, tocopheryl acetate, and petroleum jelly.\n\nThe generic name for these products, regardless of the base, is \"triple antibiotic ointment\".\nIn China, the product is named \"complex polymyxin B ointment\" and manufactured by Zhejiang Fondnow Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. The product was also marketed by the Upjohn Company under the name \"Mycitracin\", until 1997 when that name was acquired by Johnson & Johnson.\nSome people have allergic reactions to neomycin, so a \"double antibiotic ointment\" is sold that contains only\nbacitracin and polymyxin B, such as the cobrand Polysporin.\n\nA \"Plus\" variant of the ointment exists that adds the analgesic pramoxine, but uses the cheap, simple, long-lasting, but heavier petroleum jelly base common to many over-the-counter topicals. The latest version of this, a high-absorption cream, removes the bacitracin, which is unstable in such a base, but keeps the analgesic.\n\nThe three main active ingredients in Neosporin are neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and bacitracin zinc. \nOne of the main components of Neosporin is Neomycin Sulfate which is a type of antibiotic discovered in 1949 by microbiologist Selman Waksman at Rutgers University. Neomycin is a type of aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights against Gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Neomycin is often used in order to prevent risk of bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides such as Neomycin are known for their ability to bind to RNA and to change the proteins being produced by the bacteria with little to no effect on DNA. Neomycin kills bacteria as a result of irregular protein production in the bacterial cell. When the cell can no longer produce the correct proteins, its membrane will be damaged. Like Neomycin, Polymyxin B is an antibiotic. Polymyxin B alters the bacterial cell wall causing the cellular insides to leak out resulting in cell death. This antibiotic also interferes with the production of tetrahydrofolic acid by altering an enzyme. Without the tetrahydrofolic acid, the bacteria can no longer produce proteins necessary for survival. Pramoxine is used to temporarily reduce pain from burns, insect bites, and minor cuts. It works like an anesthetic by decreasing the permeability of neuron membranes. This blocks the ability of pain neurons in the area to send signals which results in numbness.\n\nIn some countries bacitracin is replaced with gramicidin.\n\nNeosporin is the brand name for a product produced by Johnson & Johnson that contains neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, and bacitracin. There is no exact date to when the antibacterial ointment was invented, but it was used as early as the 1950s. This antibiotic ointment was patented in the United States on August 27, 1951.\n\n"}

{"id": "1833378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1833378", "title": "Castizo", "text": "Castizo\n\nCastizo ( ) is a Spanish word with a general meaning of \"pure\", \"genuine\" or representative of its race (from the Spanish: \"casta\"). The feminine form is castiza. From this meaning it evolved into other meanings, such as \"typical of an area\" and it was also used for one of the colonial Spanish race categories, the \"castas\", that evolved in the 17th century. In Latin America \"Castizo\" is used to describe the individuals with an admixture of at least 75% European and 25% Native American.\n\nUnder the caste system of colonial Spanish America, the term originally applied to the offspring resulting from the union of a White person and a \"mestizo\"; that is, someone of three-quarters White and one-quarter Amerindian ancestry. During this era, various other terms (\"mestizo\", \"cuarterón de indio\", etc.) were also used. The word \"cuarterón\" usually denotes someone whose racial origin is three-quarters White and one-quarter Black, but sometimes it refers to a castizo, especially in Caribbean South America.\n\nUnder the colonial caste system, the offspring of a Spaniard and a Castiza was classified as a criollo (legally, a Spaniard born in the Americas), thus the offspring regained his or her \"purity of blood\". (\"See the related concept of Limpieza de sangre.\") For \"castizos\" whose residual quarter of Amerindian ancestry was not apparent at all, many simply consolidated themselves within the \"criollos\" and \"Peninsulares\" (Spaniards born in Spain).\n\nWith the fall of the Spanish Empire, the numerous caste terminologies fell out of use and lost all meaning, other than the categories of White, Black, Amerindian, and their three possible resulting combinations: mestizo, mulato and zambo (the latter three, now without blood quantum connotations), as these legal categories were seen as incompatible with the new concept of citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, by the second part of the 19th century, most Hispanic countries had abolished even these surviving categories of distinction among their citizens, and so the racial heritage of a person was no longer compiled by the state as part of the individual's civil record, whether to legally hinder or privilege him in matters of civil life. Some countries, however, have recently reintroduced voluntary and anonymous declarations of race (or race mixture) in recent population censuses for statistical purposes, with no legal consequence to the individual.\n\nA person who formerly would have been deemed a \"castizo\" would today simply identify as mestizo or White. The word \"castizo\" itself has lost all racial meaning.\n\nCastizos were located in the Spanish territories in America and some Portuguese parts (Brazil ), they were in regions where arrivals and European settlements with small indigenous communities, so that the mestizos of these areas would be mixed with Europeans resulting in a large population with mostly Caucasian traits.\n\nToday they are scattered in almost all Latin America but many focus on specific countries or regions of the same .\n\n\n\"Castizo\" is used in Madrid for costumes, music, speech typical of the Madrid populace about the end of the 19th century. A person dressed in \"Castizo\" fashion can be called \"manolo\"/\"manola\" and \"chulapo\"/\"chulapa\". Many zarzuelas are set in a \"Castizo\" environment, like \"La verbena de la Paloma.\"\n\nItems associated with \"Castizo\" culture are the street swivel piano, barquillos, Schottisch music (spelled as \"chotis\") and Manila shawls.\n\nCasticismo is a tendency among Spanish and Latin American intellectuals to reject foreign loanwords and stick to traditional Spanish roots. An example is \"deporte\", a word recovered from Medieval Castilian meaning \"pastime\", that successfully replaced the Anglicism \"sport\", which has the same Latin origin as the Spanish word. It's closely related to costumbrismo in literature.\n"}

It is produced and distributed by the British-based multinational alcoholic beverage maker Diageo. Since 2007, marketing and promotion for Cîroc has been handled by Sean \"Puffy\" Combs in an \"equal-share venture\" with profits from the brand being split between promotional partner Puffy and manufacturing partner Diageo.\n\nThe name \"Cî-roc\" is a portmanteau of the French word \"cime\", meaning peak or summit-top, and \"roche\", meaning rock, a reference to the high-altitude vineyards of the Gaillac region where the Mauzac grapes are grown (the î in the Cîroc logo is an i-circumflex letter used in the French language.)\n\nAccording to Diageo, Cîroc is distinguished from other vodkas as it is derived from grapes, rather than using grain, potatoes or corn and cognac. Since it is distilled at 96% and not aged, it fulfills the qualities of a vodka. The production method used for the vodka are \"snap frost\" grapes; Mauzac Blanc from the Gaillac region of France, and Ugni Blanc from the Cognac region. The juice extracted from these grapes is fermented.\n\nAll vodkas are distilled; the manufacturers of Cîroc emphasize its being distilled five times. The first four distillations of the Ugni Blanc take place in stainless steel column stills; the Mauzac Blanc grapes are distilled in copper continuous stills. These are distilled to 96.5% and 93.5%, then blended together; 95% is Ugni Blanc and 5% is Mauzac Blanc. The final distillation is performed in a traditional Armagnac style copper pot still.\n\nCîroc was founded in France by Jean-Sebastien Robicquet, whose family hails from the wine-growing region of Bordeaux. Robicquet, whose family has been in the wine business for 400 years dating back to the 17th century, had studied winemaking in university before moving into spirits instead. Having worked for French cognac-maker Hennessy for ten years, he was approached by the British-based Diageo – which owns a 34% stake in Hennessy – to produce a vodka made from grapes as opposed to grain or potato common among most vodka. Jean-Sebastien Robicquet is recognized as a \"Commander of Bordeaux\" by the Great Council of Bordeaux for his accomplishments in the field of wine/liquor.\n\nInitially launched for the North American market in 2003, NFL football player Earl Little was one of the first American brand ambassadors to promote the beverage. It was introduced to nightclubs and venues throughout the United States, marketed especially in regions such as Atlanta and Miami.\n\nIn 2007, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs agreed to become a brand ambassador for the product struggling to sell 40,000 cases a year. In December 2007, the commercial for Cîroc had Sean Combs calling the drink the \"Official Vodka of New Year's.\" Describing his ambassadorship of the brand, Combs sometimes jokingly refers to himself as \"Cîroc Obama.\" Combs has improved sales; \nThe beverage's parent company Diageo has reported 2.1 million cases sold as of December 2012. Brand Development agency Haines McGregor are responsible for Global research, positioning and identity development for Cîroc. The work included the development of brand guidelines and growth driver tool-kits for all markets.\n\nThe brand introduced two flavored varieties to the market in 2010, Red Berry and Coconut. In 2011, the company added a Peach flavor. In May 2013, CÎROC and Diddy announced that a new flavor would be released called CÎROC Amaretto. \n\nOn December 14, 2011 the company began airing a \"Luck Be a Lady\" advertising campaign for Ultra Premium Vodka, directed by Anthony Mandler. The ads feature a group of elegantly dressed friends (Diddy and Frank Vincent, Eva Pigford, Michael K. Williams, Aaron Paul, Dania Ramirez, Chrissy Teigen, and Jesse Williams) enjoying a festive night on the town.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, Sean Combs announced via his Instagram page that pineapple will be the new flavor of Cîroc. The latest flavor was announced in 2015 in Sean Diddy Combs's Instagram: green apple.\nOn August 10, 2017, Sean Combs announced via his YouTube page that a new flavor of French Vanilla would be produced in partnership with hip-hop artist French Montana.\n"}

It has deep roots in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, as it was created by a local doctor in the 1890s by mixing Jamaica ginger and sugar with local mineral waters and dispensed as a tonic for dyspepsia.\n\nAs the story goes, in 1781, Patriot James Spears was attempting to run from the British during the Revolutionary War, when his shoe became stuck in the mud of the natural spring; he left it and kept running. Upon his return, he recovered his shoe and noticed the amount of water in the depression his shoe left. He tasted the water and noticed its strong mineral content. Word of the natural spring spread quickly and before long, the area became popular among the wealthy plantation owners and by the late 1800s a small town was established. \n\nIn the late 1890s, Dr. C. R. May began prescribing the mineral springs' water to his patients complaining of stomach troubles. Because his patients frequently complained about the strong iron-like taste of the water, the doctor decided to make the water more palatable by adding Jamaican ginger and sugar. The new concoction's popularity took off and Dr. May partnered with A. J. Matheson to open the Blenheim Bottling Company in 1903. Conveniently located next to the mineral springs, the Blenheim Bottling Company plant was constructed in 1920. Producing as little as 18 to 20 cases a day, the company remained a small, humble operation for 90 years.\n\nIn 1993, Blenheim was bought by the Alan Schafer, who also owned the world-famous South of the Border roadside attraction. Since the original plant was older, Schafer decided that rather than refurbish the building, he would move the bottling operations to a new plant located next to South of the Border.\n\nDespite a marketing push that began in the late 1990s, Blenheim ginger ale is not widely distributed outside the Carolinas; however in more recent years, the company ships to 44 states and three international distributors. The spicy ale has, however, developed a cult following among food and wine aficionados. In February 1998, \"New York Times\" journalist Bill Grimes described the taste this way: \"The first swallow brings on a four-sneeze fit. The second one clears out the sinuses and leaves the tongue and throat throbbing with prickly heat.\"\n\nLuckily for its loyal followers, Blenheim's recipe has not changed in over 110 years and has three varieties to choose from: #3 \"Hot\" (pink cap), #5 \"Not As Hot\" (gold cap) and #9 \"Diet\" (white cap).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1839343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1839343", "title": "Pastiera", "text": "Pastiera\n\nPastiera napoletana (, ) is a type of Neapolitan tart made with cooked wheat, eggs, ricotta cheese, and flavoured with orange flower water. It is usually eaten at Easter.\n\nIt was used during the pagan celebrations of the return of the Spring time. During these celebrations Ceres’ priestess brought an egg, symbol of new life in procession. Because of the wheat or the einkorn, mixed with the soft ricotta cheese, it could come from the einkorn bread called \"confarreatio\", an essential ingredient in the ceremony of the type of ancient Roman weddings named after it \"confarreatio\". Another hypothesis we may consider is that it comes from ritual bread used, which spread during the period of Constantine the Great. They were made of honey and milk the people offered the catechumen during Easter Eve at the end of the ceremony of baptism.\n\nThe modern \"pastiera\" was probably invented in a Neapolitan convent. An unknown nun wanted that cake, symbol of the Resurrection, to have the perfume of the flowers of the orange trees which grew in the convent’s gardens. She mixed a handful of wheat to the white ricotta cheese, then she added some eggs, symbol of the new life, some water which had the fragrance of the flowers of the spring time, candied citron and aromatic Asian spices.\n\nWe know for certain that the nuns of the ancient convent of San Gregorio Armeno were considered to be geniuses in the complex preparation of the Pastiera. They used to prepare a great quantity for the rich families during Easter time.\n\nThere are two different ways of preparing pastiera: in the older, the ricotta is mixed with the eggs or with the grain; in the newer, thick pastry cream is added, making the \"pastiera\" softer. This innovation was introduced by Starace, a Neapolitan confectioner with a shop in a corner in Piazza Municipio (Town hall square).\n\nThe pastiera has to be cooked some days in advance, no later than Maundy Thursday or Good Friday, in order to allow the fragrances to mix properly and result in that unique flavor. The Pastiera is not only cooked but also sold and served in appropriate pans called \"ruoti\" because it is very fragile, so it would easily crumble up if removed from the \"ruoto\".\n\n"}

As Finnish is a mora-divided language, it is morae that are exchanged, not syllables (often a mora is also a syllable in a Finnish word, but not always). Also, Finnish inflectional and derivational morphology is extensive, thus applying a suffix from another word often produces a valid word. This leads to large number of possible spoonerisms. Much of practical \"sananmuunnos\" wordplay revolves around obscene double entendre expressed by spoonerism.\n\nSeveral books have been written. Some have whole stories with multiple puns in one sentence, for example. Most have a \"vocabulary\" in the back, usually a hundred or more word pairs long.\n\nInitial morae of two adjacent words are exchanged, which is spoonerism by definition.\n\nThe \"extra length\" of a long vowel is a full mora, and thus stays in its original position, making the new vowel long.\n\nIf necessary, stilted diphthongs are converted into allowed diphthongs as per phonotactics. The first vowel is the determinant for choosing the diphthong. The process preserves opening and closing diphthongs, e.g. the opening 'ie' is reflected as an opening 'uo'. \n\nIf necessary, vowel harmony is applied. As per vowel harmony, the initial syllable controls the kind of vowel selected.\nThat is, transformation is A, U, O into Ä, Y, Ö, if the former do not begin the word. Notice that information may be lost in this step, making it irreversible.\n\nIt is possible (although not accepted by some \"orthodox\") to exchange only the initial consonants, if that is the only way to get a sensible result. E.g. palasokeri [p-ala/s-okeri] 'sugar lump' → salapokeri [s-ala/p-okeri] 'playing poker in secret' (*solapakeri would not mean anything).\n\nTypically presented, spoonerisms are a kind of double entendre. Appropriately, the very term \"sananmuunnos\" is one; it becomes \"munansaannos\", which can be understood as \"small yield of penis\".\n\n\n"}

With its origins in Uttar Pradesh, India, chaat has become immensely popular in the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The word derives from Hindi \"cāṭ\" चाट (tasting, a delicacy), from \"cāṭnā\" चाटना (to lick), from Prakrit \"caṭṭei\" चट्टेइ (to devour with relish, eat noisily).\n\nThe chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread dahi vada or dahi bhalla, gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included aloo tikkis or samosa (garnished with onion, coriander, hot spices and a dash of curd), bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri.\n\nThere are common elements among these variants including dahi (yogurt); chopped onions and coriander; Sev (thin dried yellow salty noodles); and chaat masala, typically consisting of amchoor (dried mango powder), cumin, Kala Namak (rock salt), coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl.\n\nMost chaats originated in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in India, but they are now eaten all across the Indian Sub-continent. Some are results of cultural syncretism - for instance, pav bhaji (Bread/bun with cooked and mashed vegetables) originated in Mumbai but reflects a Portuguese influence, in the form of a bun, and bhel puri and Sevpuri, which originated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.\n\nIn cities where chaat is popular, there are popular chaathouses or \"dhabas\", such as Mumbai's Chowpatty Beach.

The dish consists of an outer pastry crust and is filled with egg custard and baked.\n\nThe egg tart is believed to have its origins in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The English custard tart and the Portuguese pastel de nata are European forerunners of the Chinese egg tart, which displays characteristics of both. From the pastel de nata, English styles of cooking came to influence the tart. Chefs from Guangzhou arrived in Hong Kong bringing in tart recipes since Guangzhou had heavy European influence as a major port. Taking reference from the recipes of the custard tart, the chefs in Guangzhou turned it into egg tarts by filling egg custards in the middle instead, a similar way to make simmered eggs with milk (燉蛋). However, as butter was very costly at that time, it was difficult for the chefs to make puff pastry for the tarts. Therefore, they may have used lard instead. During the 1920s, as there was tough competition between department stores in attracting customers, the chef of each department store would invent a new dim sum or dessert weekly (每週美點) as an attraction. In 1927, Zhenguang Restaurant was the first to introduce egg tarts, which was very popular and attracted other restaurants to follow suit. \n\nMany Guangzhou chefs migrated to Hong Kong and brought recipes with them. Hong Kong received the pastel de nata egg tart from Macau which was a colony of Portugal and combined aspects of the Portuguese tart with their own. The modern egg tarts were first introduced in Hong Kong in the 1940s through cha chaan tengs which served foreign-influenced dishes. Hence, the modern egg tarts emerged.\n\nToday, egg tarts are one of the more recognizable dim sum dishes offered in a dim sum house. In Guangzhou, there are 3 basic types of egg tarts: \"dan tat\" (egg tart), \"pastel de nata\" (Portuguese tart), coconut tart.\n\nIt is not only provided in \"yum cha\", but also provided in bakeries.\n\nToday, egg tarts come in many variations within Hong Kong cuisine, including egg white, milk, honey-egg, ginger-flavoured egg, which are variations of a traditional milk custard and egg custard, and also chocolate tarts, green-tea-flavoured tarts, and even bird's nest tarts.\n\nOverall, egg tarts have two main types of crusts: shortcrust pastry or puff pastry, traditionally made with lard rather than butter or shortening. They are both filled with a rich custard that is much eggier and less creamy than English custard tarts.\n\nUnlike English custard tarts, egg tarts are not sprinkled with ground nutmeg or cinnamon before serving. It may also be served piping hot rather than at room temperature like English custard tarts.\n\nThere is a slight difference between Hong Kong and Macau versions. Macau's version was brought by Portuguese colonizers. It is believed the Portuguese egg tart made its way to Hong Kong, where it was influenced by British custard tarts by chefs from Guangzhou. The Macanese version has a browned top which more strongly resembles the pastel de nata. The most famous maker of Macanese egg tarts is Lord Stow's Bakery.\n\n\n"}

It is typically served during a meal or as a dessert. It is also known in some regions as meetha bhaat, payasam, payasa, and phirni.\n\nBoth both \"kṣeer / kshira\" (क्षीर) and \"paayasam\" (पायसम्) are Sanskrit words which mean the \"milk\".\n\nIn Hindi and Marathi, खीर \"khīr\"; Punjabi, کھیر/ਖੀਰ; Odia, ଖିରି \"khiri\"; Sindhi, کھیر; Urdu, کھیر; Dhivehi, ކިރު \"kiru\"; and . It is also known as \"payasam\" (Tamil: பாயாசம், Telugu: పాయసం, Malayalam: പായസം), \"payasa\" (Kannada: ಪಾಯಸ), \"payesh\" (), \"faesh\" (), \"payox\" (Assamese: পায়স), or \"Paays\" (पायस) in Konkani.\nIn Gujarati, it is often called \"dūdpāk\", દઉદપઅક. It is also known as firni in some parts of Sylhet and Iran as Ferni (فرنی). It is called Kiru (ކިރު) in Maldivian language.\n\nA story about the origin of payasam says that Maharshi Parashuram invented the dish as an offering to the Ambalappuzha Shree Krishna temple in Kerala.\n\nKheer is prepared in festivals, temples, and all special occasions. The term \"kheer\" (used in North India) may derive from the Sanskrit word \"Ksheera\" (which means \"milk\"). Other terms like \"Payasam\" or \"payesh\" (used in the Bengal region) are derived from the Sanskrit word \"Payasa\" or \"Payasam\", which also means \"milk\". It is prepared using milk, rice, ghee, sugar/jaggery, and \"khoya\". Some also add a little bit of heavy cream for a richer taste. It is often garnished using almonds, cashews, raisins and pistachios. There is one more popular version of North Indian kheer, prepared during festivals and havan in Varanasi by using only milk, rice, ghee, sugar, cardamom, dried fruit, and \"kesar\" (saffron milk). It is an essential dish in many Hindu feasts and celebrations. While the dish is most often made with rice, it can also be made with other ingredients, such as vermicelli (\"semiya\" in South India, \"seviyan\", \"seviyaan\", \"sayviah\", or other spellings) or tapioca (locally known as sabudana).\n\nRice was known to the Romans, and possibly introduced to Europe as a food crop, dating as early as the 8th or 10th Century AD, and so the recipe for the popular English rice pudding is believed by some to be descended from kheer. Similar rice recipes (originally called \"potages\") go back to some of the earliest written recipes in English history.\nThe Odia version of rice kheer (known as Kheeri) and (Payas in Northern Odisha) likely originated in the city of Puri, in Odisha more than 2,000 years ago. It is cooked to this day within the temple precincts there. Every single day, hundreds of temple cooks work around 752 hearths in what is supposed to be the world's largest kitchen to cook over 100 different dishes, including kheer, enough to feed at least 10,000 people.\n\nPayas is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with annaprashana (weaning ritual of an infant), as well as other festivals and birthday celebrations in an Odia household.\n\nAlthough white sugar is commonly used, adding \"Gurh\" (jaggery) as a sweetener, is an interesting and extremely delicious variation prepared in Bengal and Odisha, especially during winter and spring when fresh gurh is available.\n\nIn Bengal, it is called \"payas\" or \"payesh\". A traditional Bengali meal can be traced 2000 years old and it is one of important sweet dish payas followed by other sweets.\n\nPayesh is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with annaprashana (weaning ritual of an infant) and Janmatithi (birthday) in a Bengali household. It is called \"kheer\" in Bengali if milk is used in a significantly greater amount than rice. The people of West Bengal and Bangladesh prepare \"payesh\" with \"gurh\", ketaki, glutinous rice, vermicelli, semolina and coconut milk, and the result is a stickier and creamier dessert.\n\nIn Assam, it is called \"payoxh\" and in addition to other dried fruits, cherries are added to give it a light delicate pink colour. Sometimes rice may be replaced with sago. It is one of the most significant desserts served in Assamese families and quite often a part of religious ceremonies.\n\nIn Bihar, it is called \"Chawal ki Kheer\". It is made with rice, full fat cream, milk, sugar, cardamom powder, an assortment of dried fruits, and saffron. Another version of this kheer, called Rasiya, is made with jaggery. Jaggery is used instead of sugar in the process. The jaggery version looks brown in color and has a mild, sweet taste.\n\nThe South Indian version, \"payasam\" (Tamil: பாயசம், Malayalam: പായസം, pronounced , Telugu: పాయసం) or \"payasa\" (a Kannada term; Kannada: ಪಾಯಸ), is an integral part of traditional South Indian meals. South Indian payasam also makes extensive use of jaggery (Tamil: வெல்லம் \"vellam\", Telugu: బెల్లం \"bellam\", Kannada: ಬೆಲ್ಲ \"bella\", Malayalam: ശർക്കര \"sharkkara\") and coconut milk in place of sugar and milk. Vermicelli (\"semiya\") is commonly used. The most common types of payasam in South India include milk payasam,sago/tapioca pearl payasam, Semiya (vermicelli) payasam, Paruppu payasam, Nei (clarified butter) payasam (also known as Aravana payasam), Carrot payasam, Wheat payasam, Wheat rava (wheat semolina) payasam, and Arisi Thengai (coconut and rice) payasam, which is a traditional Iyengar-style recipe.\n\nIn a South Indian meal, payasam or payasa, is served first at any formal or auspicious occasion. Payasam is also served after rasam rice, while rice with buttermilk forms the last item of the meal. Payasam also forms an integral part of the Kerala feast (sadya), where it is served and relished from the flat banana leaf instead of cups. In Malayalee or Kerala cuisine, there are several different kinds of payasam that can be prepared from a wide variety of fruits and starch bases, an example being \"chakkapradhaman\" made from jackfruit pulp and \"adapradhaman\" made from flat ground rice.\n\nThe Hyderabadi version is called \"gil-e-firdaus\". It is a thick kheer made with milk and bottle gourd. \"Gil-e-firdaus\", literally translated, means \"the clay of paradise\".\n\nPayasam is served as an offering to the Gods in South Indian Hindu temples during rituals and ceremonies. In Kerala, Ambalapuzha Pal Payasam (Milk Kheer) and Ada Pradhaman are well-known payasam dishes.\n\nAcross the Subcontinent, \"kheer\" is prepared and eaten at festivals. It is offered to Hindu deities as a \"bhog\" or \"prasadam\".\n\nThe dish is also consumed during Ramadan and prepared for the feasts of Muslim weddings and festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha.\n\nA similar dessert, known as \"firni\", is eaten in \nIran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and among the Muslim communities of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Today, restaurants offer \"firni\" in a wide range of flavours, similar to kheer. Firni used ground rice rather than whole rice.\n\n"}

{"id": "1848091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848091", "title": "Arrack", "text": "Arrack\n\nArrack is a distilled alcoholic drink typically produced in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, made from the fermented sap of coconut flowers or sugarcane, and also with grain (e.g. red rice) or fruit depending upon the country of origin. It is sometimes sometimes spelt arak, or simply referred to as 'rack or 'rak. There are two primary styles that are very different: \"Batavia Arrack\" is often clear in color but has a flavor profile more similar to dark rum, with a distinctive \"funk\" or \"hogo\" imparted to it from fermented red rice. \"Ceylon Arrack\", by contrast, is a more refined and subtle spirit. It has hints of Cognac and rum character and a wealth of delicate floral notes. Both styles are also made \"in house\" by local citizenry and can be more akin to moonshine in their presentation.\n\nArrack predates all \"New World\" spirits, as it is a parent to aguardiente (which was, in turn, the parent of rum, rhum agricole, and ron). Genoese merchants made the spirit as a byproduct of their sugar cane production in the Canary Islands. Besides making sugar, they produced arrack instead of importing it for their growing list of customers. Other early arrack was distilled from molasses and water, using dried cakes of red rice and botanicals that contain yeast and other fungi to trigger the fermentation process (this technique can be traced back thousands of years to China and even predates the birth of distillation). It is also claimed to have been distilled in India in 800 BC, but while palm wine and fermented sugar-cane drinks were being made around this time period not all believe that formal distillation was taking place.\n\nOutside Asia, the spirit was a common ingredient in the proliferation of Indian alcoholic punch, and was particularly popular in Holland and Sweden. It was first drank in the United States prior to prohibition, but is now mostly confused with the more common and similar spelled anise-flavored spirit arak.\n\nRegardless of the exact origin, arrack has come to symbolize a multitude of largely unrelated, distilled alcohols produced throughout Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. This is largely due to the proliferation of distillation knowledge throughout the Middle East during the 14th century. Each country named its own alcohol by using various Latin alphabet forms of the same word which was synonymous with distillation at the time (\"arak, araka, araki, ariki, arrack, arack, raki, raque, racque, rac, rak\"). The 1864 English and Australian Cookery Book described Arrack as \"a spirituous liquor from the East Indies. This term, or its corruption, rack, is applied to any spirituous liquor in the East. The true arrack is said to be distilled from toddy, the fermented juice of the cocoa-nut tree. It is, however, frequently distilled from rice and sugar,fermented with the cocoa-nut juice.\"\n\nArrack was banned in the states of Kerala in 1996, and Karnataka on 1 July 2007.\nWithin Indonesia itself, the term \"arak\" is still widely used to describe arrack. Arak (or rice wine) was a popular alcoholic beverage during the colonial era. It is considered the \"rum\" of Indonesia because, like rum, it is distilled from sugarcane. It is a pot still distillation. To start the fermentation, local fermented red rice is combined with local yeast to give a unique flavor and smell of the distillate. It is distilled to approx. 70% ABV. Like rum, Batavia-arrack is often a blend of different original parcels.\n\nOne of the longest established arack companies in Indonesia is the \"Batavia Arak Company\" (Dutch \"Batavia-Arak Maatschappij\"), which was already in business by 1872, became a limited liability company in 1901, and was still operating in the early 1950s. The Batavia Arak Company also exported arack to the Netherlands and had an office in Amsterdam. Some of the arrack brand produced by Batavia Arak Company were KWT (produced in the Bandengan (Kampung Baru) area of old Jakarta) and OGL. Still commonly available in Northern Europe and Southern Asia, Batavia Arrack can be difficult to find in the United States. \"Batavia-Arrack van Oosten\" is a more recently available brand.\n\nBatavia-Arrack is said to enhance flavor when used as a component in other products, such as pastries (like the Scandinavian Runeberg torte or the Dresdner Stollen), or in the confectionery and flavor industries. It is used in herbal and bitter liqueurs, and as a component in alcoholic punches (such as punsch, regent punch, royal punch, and black tea-port milk punch).\n\nIts use in punch was noted by early American bartender Jerry Thomas: \"Most of the arrack imported into this country is distilled from rice, and comes from Batavia. It is but little used in America, except to flavor punch; the taste of it is very agreeable in this mixture. Arrack improves very much with age. It is much used in some parts of India, where it is distilled from toddy, the juice of the cocoanut tree\".\n\nIn Indonesia, arrack is often created as a form of moonshine. Such illicit production may result in methanol-tainted arrack that can lead to death.\n\nThe Filipino term for wine (and by extension alcoholic beverages in general) is \"alak\", derived from the Arabic word \"arrak\". The term \"arak,\" though, is specifically used in Ilocano.\n\n\"Lambanóg\" is commonly described as coconut wine or coconut vodka. Distilled from the sap of the unopened coconut flower, it is particularly potent, having a typical alcohol content of 80 to 90 proof (40 to 45%) after a single distillation; this may go as high as 166 proof (83%) after the second distillation. As with coconut arrack, the process begins with the sap from the coconut flower. The sap is harvested into bamboo receptacles similar to rubber tapping, then cooked or fermented to produce a coconut toddy called \"tubà\". The \"tubà\", which by itself is also a popular beverage, is further distilled to produce lambanóg.\n\nUntil recently, lambanóg was considered a local analogue to moonshine and other home-brewed alcoholic drinks due to the process's long history as a cottage industry. Though usually served pure, it is traditionally flavoured with raisins, but lambanóg has recently been marketed in several flavours such as mango, blueberry, pineapple, bubblegum and cinnamon in an effort to appeal to all age groups.\n\nQuezon province is the major producer of lambanog wine in the Philippines because of the abundance of coconut plantations in the area. The Lambanog originated and first distilled in Tayabas in Quezon, a Spanish soldier named Alandy established the first distilling business, which has come down to the present generation as Mallari Distillery. The three main distilleries in the country are also located in Tayabas City - the Mallari Distillery, the Buncayo Distillery, and the Capistrano Distillery (Vito, 2004).\n\nThe Italian explorer, Antonio Pigafetta, stated that the arrack that he drank in Palawan and nearby islands in 1521 was made from distilled rice wine.\n\nOn November 29, a number of residents from Calamba, Laguna drank lambanog, and then began to experience symptoms such as stomach cramps, resulting in them being brought to the hospital; they subsequently died thereafter. Other persons who consumed lambanog experienced other symptoms such as nausea, chest pains, and blurry vision. It was shown that the lambanog residents drank was produced in plastic bottle, instead of glass.\n\nMeanwhile, another four people, who were tricycle drivers, were reported to have died after they consumed arrack and thirteen others were hospitalized in Quezon City. According to the authorities, the drivers were reportedly drinking at the house of one of the victims, sometime between November 30 to December 2, where they were served six liters of arrack which they bought. Shortly after, they started to experience stomach pains and vomiting. They were brought to the hospital but died shortly thereafter. It was reported that most people who consumed the beverage around this time had managed to maintain their strength.\n\nOn December 7, according to the Food and Drug Administration, they found \"high levels of methanol\" in the beverage. On December 9, the FDA recorded at least 21 people from Calamba, Novaliches, Quezon, and Bulacan died from consuming lambanog. On December 12, the FDA inspectors and the authorities raided the source of the lambanog manufacturer Bossing Tumador Lambanog. Since the deaths relating to lambanog had emerged, many of its sellers were worried about the declination of their income. The FDA said that the contents of methanol in commercially-produced lambanog should not exceed to 0.1%. However, on its FDA investigation, it was revealed that the respective lambanog bottles victims drunk contains 6.6%, 8.9% and 6.5%.\n\nSri Lanka is the largest producer of coconut arrack and up until 1992 the government played a significant role in its production.\n\nOther than water, the entire manufacturing process revolves around the fermentation and distillation of a single ingredient, the sap of unopened flowers from a coconut palm (\"Cocos nucifera\"). Each morning at dawn, men known as toddy tappers move among the tops of coconut trees using connecting ropes not unlike tightropes. A single tree may contribute up to two litres per day.\n\nDue to its concentrated sugar and yeast content, the captured liquid naturally and immediately ferments into a mildly alcoholic drink called \"toddy\", \"tuak\", or occasionally \"palm wine\". Within a few hours after collection, the toddy is poured into large wooden vats, called \"wash backs\", made from the wood of teak or Berrya cordifolia. The natural fermentation process is allowed to continue in the wash backs until the alcohol content reaches 5-7% and deemed ready for distillation.\n\nDistillation is generally a two-step process involving either pot stills, continuous stills, or a combination of both. The first step results in \"low wine\", a liquid with an alcohol content between 20 and 40%. The second step results in the final distillate with an alcohol content of 60 to 90%. It is generally distilled to between 33% and 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 66 to 100 proof. The entire distillation process is completed within 24 hours. Various blends of coconut arrack diverge in processing, yet the extracted spirit may also be sold raw, repeatedly distilled or filtered, or transferred back into halmilla vats for maturing up to 15 years, depending on flavor, color and fragrance requirements.\n\nPremium blends of arrack add no other ingredients, while the inexpensive and common blends are mixed with neutral spirits before bottling. Most people describe the taste as resembling \"…a blend between whiskey and rum\", similar, but distinctively different at the same time.\n\nCoconut arrack is traditionally consumed by itself or with ginger beer, a popular soda in Sri Lanka. It also may be mixed in cocktails as a substitute for the required portions of either rum or whiskey. Arrack is often combined with popular mixers such as cola, soda water, and lime juice.\n\nAccording to the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre's 2008 report on alcohol in Sri Lanka, the types of arrack are:\n\n\nSri Lanka's largest manufacturers, listed in order based on their 2007 annual production of arrack, are:\n\n\nCeylon Arrack, a brand of Sri Lankan coconut arrack, was recently launched in the UK in 2010. It is also available in France and Germany. White Lion VSOA entered the American market soon after.\nHistorically Arrack has been a common beverage on the island of St Helena, This is likely due to influences of the East India Company, which controlled St Helena and used it as a halfway point between India and England.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, batavia-arrack has historically been mixed with other ingredients in order to make Swedish punsch (now available in prepackaged bottles). The alcohol content is normally not over 25%, although it has a high sugar content of nearly 30%. The original recipe was a mixture of arrack with water, sugar, lemon, and tea and/or spices (chiefly nutmeg). Today punsch is mostly drunk warm as an accompaniment to yellow split pea soup, although it is also used as a flavouring in several types pastries and sweets as well. The name arrak is still retained for some pastries, for example \"arraksboll\", whereas punsch is used for things like \"punschrulle\".\n\nThe word derived from the Arabic word \"arak\" (عرق, \"arq\"), meaning 'distillate'. In the Middle East and Near East, the term \"arak\" is usually used for liquor distilled from grapes and flavored with anise.\n\nUnlike arak, the word arrack has been considered by some experts to be derived from \"areca nut\", a palm seed originating in India from the areca tree and used as the basis for many varieties of arrack. In 1838, Samuel Morewood's work on the histories of liquors was published. On the topic of arrack, he said:\n\n\n\n"}

Somewhat torpedo-shaped, they are fatter than fresh corn tortillas and stuffed with cooked ground beans, cheese, fava beans, chicharron or other ingredients and fried or toasted. Tlacoyos can be served as an accompaniment to soups and stews or as appetizers for celebrations. Most traditional tlacoyos do not have lard or salt in the masa, and if not eaten soon after they are cooked, they become very tough and dry, even if reheated. In Mexican markets, vendors keep their tlacoyos warm by putting them in a covered basket, with the additional effect that the steam keeps them moist for a longer time. This dish is similar to the Salvadoran pupusa.\n\nThe name \"tlacoyo\" is a variation of the Nahuatl word \"tlahtlaōyoh\" ), a name given to an antojito typical of central Mexico.\n\nSince it is similar in shape to a huarache (but smaller), and is made of the same corn as the sope and is even thicker (so it has more resistance to wet toppings), Mexican street vendors, especially in Mexico City, sometimes sell it with toppings on it, as an alternative to the sopes and huaraches. However, the traditional tlacoyo is supposed to be consumed without any toppings on it except for fresh salsa. This is the form in which they are typically found in the streets. \n\nTlacoyos come in three different colors, although no artificial colors are added to its preparation. The color comes from the cornmeal used to prepare the masa which the tlacoyo is made with. The most common is blue masa, made from blue corn kernels.\n\n"}

{"id": "1850147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1850147", "title": "Arche", "text": "Arche\n\nArche (; ) is a Greek word with primary senses \"beginning\", \"origin\" or \"source of action\" (: from the beginning, οr : the original argument), and later \"first principle\" or \"element\", first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23). By extension, it may mean \"first place, power\", \"method of government\", \"empire, realm\", \"authorities\" (in plural: ), \"command\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \"ultimate underlying substance\" and \"ultimate undemonstrable principle\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC), \"arche\" (or \"archai\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \"arche\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.\n\nIn the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is Chaos, considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation \"chaos\" is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the earth and the sky, after their separation. \"Chaos\" may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. The conception of the \"divine\" as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers.\nIn the Orphic cosmogony, the unaging Chronos produced Aether and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared.\n\nIn the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the Babylonian creation story, Enuma Elish the primordial world is described as a \"watery chaos\" from which everything else appeared. Something similar is described in Book of Genesis where the spirit of God is moving upon the dark face of the waters.\n\nIn the Hindu cosmology, which is similar to the Vedic cosmology, in the beginning there was nothing in the Universe but darkness. The self-manifested being created the primordial waters and established his seed into it. This turned into a golden egg (Hiranyagarbha) from which everything else appeared.\n\nThe heritage of Greek mythology already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of \"being\" was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought.\nIn the ancient Greek philosophy, \"arche\" is the element and the first principle of existing things. This is considered as a permanent substance or nature (physis) either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved. (Aristotle-Metaph.A, 983, b6ff). Anaximander was the first philosopher that used \"arche\" for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called \"the substratum\" (Simplicius Phys. 150, 22). The Greek philosophers ascribed to \"arche\" divine attributes. It is the divine horizon of substance that encompasses and values all things.\n\nThales of Miletus (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water, and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the Homeric statement that the surrounding Oceanus (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers.\n\nThales' theory was refuted by his successor and esteemed pupil, Anaximander. Anaximander noted that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the apeiron, an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return. \"Apeiron\" (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original \"chaos\" of Hesiod (yawning abyss). He probably intended it to mean primarily \"indefinite in kind\" but assumed it also to be \"of unlimited extent and duration\". The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"arche\" is called \"eternal and ageless\". (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2)\n\nAnaximenes, Anaximander's pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of rarefaction and condensation (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order. The \"arche\" is technically what underlies all of reality/appearances.\n\n"}

It was the eastern branch of the MCI Internet Exchange. Its name officially stood for \"Metropolitan Area Exchange, East\".\n\nMAE-East was founded in the 1990s as one of the first large Internet peering exchanges and by 1997 it was estimated half the world's traffic passed through it. At the time it was located in the underground parking garage of an office building in Vienna, VA.\n\nMAE-East was originally created in 1992, primarily by Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) and Rick Adams of UUNET. Steven Feldman, an Internet architect, recalls \"A group of network providers in the Virginia area got together over beer one night and decided to connect their networks.\" The founding networks were AlterNet (UUNET's backbone service), PSINet and Sprint-ICM. MFS was the service provider offering metropolitan fiber, co-location facilities, cross connects and switch ports for the ISPs to interconnect. MAE-East was modeled after FIX East and Fix West. It was established as a Distributed Layer 2 exchange (shared 10-Mb Ethernet over DS3). By February 1993, the 10-Mb metropolitan ethernet-over-DS3 connected the Sprint POP (ICMnet and AlterNet), College Park POP (AlterNet and NSFNet), MCI POP (SURAnet), and WillTel POP (PSINet). It did not have a multi-lateral policy or have multi-lateral agreements, meaning it was a neutral exchange from the perspective that any ISP could join, all members were treated the same, but there was no requirement for any other members to peer with that ISP.\n\nIn 1993, the National Science Foundation awarded MFS/MAE-East a grant establishing it as one of the four original NAPs (Network Access Point). MAE-East then migrated to a collocation-based exchange in order to support higher speeds with the original colo at 1919 Gallows Road in Vienna, in a cinder-block room carved out of the underground P1 parking garage. The MAE upgraded to switched Ethernet and shared FDDI in Fall 1994, growing to seven GigaSwitches] (a precursor to Gigabit Ethernet). The FDDI architecture consisted of collocations at 8100 Boone Blvd (location of MFS offices across the road from Gallows Road), 1919 Gallows Road, and a number of private customer POPs. The GigaSwitch access was limited to 100 Mbit/s, suffered from Head-of-Line Blocking, reached scaling limits, and was difficult to maintain (i.e., suffered outages). MAE-East FDDI was closed to new customers after 1998 and was shut down in June 2001.\n\nMAE-East ATM was created as successor to the FDDI due to the FDDI limitations. MAE-East ATM was trialed in 1997 and went into production in 1998. ATM allowed for high-speed access (e.g. DS3 -OC12); managed resources to eliminate congestion; Virtual Private Interconnect (PVCs), which mitigated effects of some behaviors where a single customer could impact the entire exchange. Frame Relay Access was added in 2002-2003 (OC3–OC48). In 2003, MAE-East ATM/Frame facilities were located at Boone Blvd, Sunrise Blvd, Tyco Road and Ashburn VA.\n\nBY 2009, many of the ISPs at MAE-East had moved to Equinix Ashburn, a competing Internet Exchange (IX). Today, several on-line resources (peeringdb.org, internetexchangemap.com) suggest MAE-East is gone. In any event, large providers tend to connect directly to allow higher speeds and reduce costs. Many of the smaller providers are now simply customers of the tier 1 network operators.\n\nThe following providers were members of this exchange:\n\n\n\n\"How Equinix beat MAE-East,\" a blog written in 2009.\n"}

In that context, the word Hosanna seems to be a \"special kind of respect\" given to the one who saves, saved, will save or is saving now. If so Hosanna means \"a special honor to the one who saves\". The old interpretation \"Save, now!\", based on Psalm 118:25, does not fully explain the occurrence of the word in the Gospels as a shout of jubilation, and this has given rise to complex discussions.\n\nIn a liturgical context, it refers to a cry expressing an appeal for divine help.\n\nThe grandson of Prophet Muhammed, and the son of Ali was named Hussein. In arabic, Hussein is also referred to as Hussaina or Hossein/a. Shia Muslims believe that Hussein sacrificed his soul for the sake of humanity and not only Islam, which places him in the highest levels of heaven.\n\nIn Jewish liturgy, the word is applied specifically to the Hoshana Service, a cycle of prayers from which a selection is sung each morning during Sukkot, the Feast of Booths or Tabernacles. The complete cycle is sung on the seventh day of the festival, which is called Hoshana Rabbah (הושענא רבא, \"Great Hosanna\").\n\n\"Hosanna\" was the shout of praise or adoration made in recognition of the Messiahship of Jesus on his triumphal entry into Jerusalem, \"Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\" It is used in the same way in Christian praise.\n\nThe \"Hosanna Anthem\", based on the phrase \"Hosanna\", is a traditional Moravian Church anthem written by Bishop Christian Gregor of Herrnhut sung on Palm Sunday and the first Sunday of Advent. It is antiphonal, i.e. a call-and-response song; traditionally, it is sung between the children and adult congregation, though it is not unheard of for it to be done in other ways, such as between choir and congregation, or played between trombone choirs.\n\nArchitect Frank Lloyd Wright famously used the word in his exclamation \"Hosanna! A client!\" after securing a commission, breaking a long, dry spell.\n\n\"Hosanna\" is also the name of one of the songs featured in the 1971 rock opera \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". The song covers the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, as in the above Biblical passages. Jesus is briefly harassed by the high priest Caiaphas but the people celebrate him as the Messiah. There is also a reprise of the chorus when Jesus is sent to King Herod.\n\nMany songs for church use bear the title \"Hosanna\", including songs written by New Zealand singer Brooke Fraser Ligertwood (released on the 2007 Hillsong United albums \"All of the Above\" and live on \"Saviour King\" and covered by the Canadian group Starfield on their album \"I Will Go\"); another song by Paul Baloche on his 2006 album \"A Greater Song\"; another by gospel artist Kirk Franklin, and another by Andrew Peterson on his 2008 album \"Resurrection Letters II\". \nSidney Mohede's \"Hosanna (Be Lifted High)\" was included on Israel Houghton's 2011 Grammy Award-winning album \"Love God, Love People\". In the 1969 Broadway musical 1776 the word is used repeatedly as part of the chorus of the song \"Cool, Cool, Considerate Men.\"\n\nA. R. Rahman composed the song \"Hosanna\" for the 2010 Tamil movie \"Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa\". Here the word is used as an exclamation of joy when a man sees his beloved. The Christian Catholic Secular Forum (CSF) objected to this song and asked film-makers Fox Star Studios to remove it from the final cut of the Hindi remake of the film, \"Ekk Deewana Tha\". Paul McCartney's album New, released in 2013, features a song titled Hosanna. Contextually, he uses the phrase as a cry for help in light of the world's current state of affairs.\n\nAmerican comedians Tim and Eric use the phrase \"blessed Hosanna\" freely in their piece \"Morning Prayer with Skott and Behr.\"\n\nIn The Philippines, particularly in tagalog-speaking provinces, the term Osanahan refers to the procession of the priest from a prayer station (termed kuból or Galilea in some provinces) after the blessing of palms; to the parish church for the liturgy of the Mass of the Sunday of the Lord's Passion. This procession is accompanied by the faithful, with little children dressed as angels singing Filipino or Latin antiphons set into lowland Filipino music, with either a rondalla or a brass band as musical accompaniment.\n\n\n"}

It can be considered a special type of chorizo. It is made of minced pork, or a mixture of minced pork and beef, is encased in either lamb tripe or plastic and has a fat content that varies between 70 and 80%. The sausage is flavoured with garlic, salt and paprika, which gives it a bright red colour. It is usually baked, fried, or grilled and often accompanies other dishes, sometimes as part of tapas. The final cured product tends to be thinner than traditional chorizo or sausage, with a diameter of approximately 25mm. The sausages average in length, though there are cases when they reach up to long.\n\nIn the Aragonese Pyrenees there are two different sorts of \"chistorra\": one of them made only of pork meat and another made of lungs, boned pig head and the pancreas, called \"berica\".\n\nThe local variety of chistorra available in the province of León is called \"Chistorra de León\" and is made with a larger percentage of beef.\n\nOne of the most popular dishes involving chistorra is \"huevos rotos con chistorra y patatas\", a dish with fried eggs and potatoes.\n\nChistorra is usually fried whole, but served chopped into smaller sections as a tapa. Fried chistorra is often accompanied by beer or wine, especially of the Txakoli variety. Fried chistorra is also a typical \"bocadillo\" (sandwich) filler (\"bocadillo de chistorra\").\n\nOther common dishes include \"croissant preñado\", a croissant with chistorra filler, and \"tortilla con chistorra\", a potato or egg omelet with chistorra.\n\nChistorra is traditionally served on the feast day of Thomas the Apostle (December 21) in San Sebastián. During the festivities, chistorra is often served alongside \"talo\" and is accompanied by cider.\n\n"}

The company is also known for supporting many extreme sports events such as Bellator MMA, Ultimate Fighting Championship, Moto GP, BMX, Motocross, Speedway, skateboarding and snowboarding, as well as electronic sports. In collaboration with Outbreak Presents, Monster Energy promotes a number of music bands around the world, like Fetty Wap, Iggy Azalea, 21 Savage, Asking Alexandria, Anthrax, Black Veil Brides, The Word Alive, Machine Gun Kelly , Suicidal Tendencies, Maximum the Hormone, Korn, and Five Finger Death Punch. Monster currently sponsors the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, the FIA World Rallycross Championship, and the PBR: Unleash the Beast Professional Bull Riders tour, in addition to sponsoring the bag of professional golfer Tiger Woods.\n\nEnergy drinks have been associated with health risks, such as masking the effects of intoxication when consumed with alcohol, and excessive or repeated consumption can lead to cardiac and psychiatric conditions. However, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that an adequate consumption of Monster and other popular energy drinks is safe and that the amount of caffeine in standard Monster cans is unlikely to interact adversely with other typical constituents of energy drinks or with alcohol. Energy drinks have the effects that caffeine and sugar give, but there is no distinct evidence that the wide variety of other ingredients has any effect.\n\nThere are 34 different drinks under the Monster brand in North America, including its core Monster Energy line, Java Monster, Extra Strength, Import, Rehab and Muscle Monster.\n\nMonster Energy is advertised mainly through sponsorship of sporting events, including motocross, BMX, mountain biking, snowboarding, skateboarding, car racing, speedway, and also through sponsorship of eSports events. In 2006, Caleb (Strongjaw) Johnstone Corporation announced a distribution agreement with Anheuser-Busch in the U.S. and Grupo Jumex in Mexico. Monster became the title sponsor of NASCAR's top series starting with the 2017 season, renaming it to the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nIn 2012, Colton Lile Corporation announced that they were switching distributors from Anheuser-Busch to Coca-Cola.\n\nThe Monster Energy Drink logo is widely recognized among major beverages and at sponsored events. The design was created by McLean Design, a California-based strategic branding firm. The logo is composed of a vibrant green ″M″ on a field of black the m is composed of 3 lines. The ″M″ is stylized in such a way as to imply that it is formed by the claws of a monster ripping through the can.\n\nThe caffeine content of most Monster Energy drinks is approximately 10 mg/oz (33.81 mg/100ml), or 160 mg for a 16 oz can. The packaging usually contains a warning label advising consumers against drinking more than 48 oz per day (16 oz per day in Australia). The drinks are not recommended for pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine.\n\nThe ingredients include carbonated water, sucrose, glucose, citric acid, natural flavors, taurine, sodium citrate, color added, panax ginseng root extract, -carnitine, -tartarate, caffeine, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, niacinamide, sodium chloride, Glycine max glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana seed extract, pyridoxine hydrochloride, sucralose, riboflavin, maltodextrin, and cyanocobalamin.\n\nIn August 2017, Monster renewed a sponsorship with mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor.

NASCAR's chief marketing officer cited Monster's \"youthful and edgy\" brand as a driving force behind the deal, as NASCAR seeks to build its younger audience and bolster the sport's long term health. Monster is endorsed by driver Kurt Busch and currently sponsors his No. 1 Chip Ganassi Racing car; prior to joining SHR and then CGR, Monster had sponsored the likes of Robby Gordon Ricky Carmichael, and the No. 54 Xfinity Series car of Joe Gibbs Racing/Kyle Busch Motorsports.\n\nMercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport has been sponsored by Monster since 2010 and are currently endorsed by Valtteri Bottas and five time world champion Lewis Hamilton.\n\nThe company was endorsed by Australian touring car driver Jamie Whincup from late 2009 to 2012.

The deal allows the product's logo to be used on the horse's horse sheets, on jockey Victor Espinoza's shirt and boots, as well as caps and other gear worn by people around the horse. \"The energy and excitement that American Pharoah has generated around the world syncs perfectly with the brand.\"\n\nMonster Energy also sponsors several individuals in the eSports community, as well as eSports associations. Monster Energy is affiliated with eSports in North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia. Some of the organizations and individuals they support or have supported include the Australian organization \"MindFreak\", Paris Saint-Germain eSports, and the streamer TimTheTatMan.\n\nMonster Beverage Corporation has been criticized for its policy to sue companies or groups which use the word \"Monster\" or the letter \"M\" in their marketing for trademark infringement. Examples include the aquarium hobbyist site MonsterFishKeepers.com, Bevreview.com, a beverage review site which published an unfavorable review of the Monster Energy drink and a Vermont microbrewery which marketed a beer named \"Vermonster\".\nMonster Beverage dropped the lawsuit against the microbrewery due to the negative publicity the lawsuit generated.\n\nIn August 2012, the Beastie Boys filed a lawsuit against the company for copyright infringement over Monster's use of their music in an online campaign. In 2014, a jury found Monster Beverage Corp. had infringed on Beastie Boys copyright by using songs without permission, and owed the group $1.7 million.\n\nIn March 2016, Monster filed a lawsuit to revoke the company trademark of Thunder Beast LLC (Washington, DC), a small root beer brewery, insisting the use of “beast” in the company name encroached on Monster’s trademark slogan “Unleash the Beast.” The owner of Thunder Beast, Stephen Norberg, is currently fighting Monster’s lawsuit.\n\nIn June 2017, Page Zeringue, a former employee of Monster Energy Company, filed a complaint in the U.S District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against Monster Energy Company alleging that the beverage company violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Zeringue began working for Monster Energy Company in Feb 2008. She alleges she was discriminated against because of her gender and was subjected to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment. The suit states she was terminated in October 2015. Zeringue holds Monster Energy Company responsible because the defendant allegedly retaliated against her when she reported the unwelcome sexual advances to the human resources department.\n\nIn June 2017 Sara Rabuse of Los Angeles County filed a personal injury claim against Monster Energy Company Executive, Brent Hamilton and his employer, Monster Energy Company. Rabuse is suing for damages while she was violently attacked during a Monster Energy work function Hamilton invited her to attend. Rabuse Claims Hamilton, Executive of the Monster Energy Music Department, flew her from L.A to meet him at the Country Music Awards in Nashville at Monster Energy’s Company expense. When she arrived in Nashville at the airport, he was drunk. Sara Rabuse claims the heavy drinking led to a fight in the hotel room, where Hamilton choked her. Rabuse claims the only way to free herself from Hamilton’s grasp was to poke him in the eye, but when she did, Hamilton, bit her thumb. Rabuse claimed the bite got infected, forcing her to spend 24 hours in the hospital. Rabuse holds Monster Energy Company responsible because the company allegedly knew of its employees drinking problem and ignored it\n\nIn August 2018 Monsta Pizza of Wendover in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, fought a claim brought by Monster Energy in the intellectual property office. The claim was that the pizza firm could be mistaken for Monster Energy, leaving customers confused. The pizza firm won a landmark ruling against Monster Drinks, when the court decided there would be no case of misrepresentation.\n\nIn December 2011, 14-year-old Anais Fournier died of \"cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity\" after drinking two 710 ml (24 US fl oz) cans of Monster Energy drink containing a combined amount of ~475 mg caffeine. Fournier had a pre-existing heart condition, as well as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In October 2012, her parents sued the company. Monster has insisted that its energy drink played no role in Fournier's death. A Freedom of Information Request revealed that from 2003 to 2012 the Food and Drug Administration had received reports of five deaths occurring after drinking Monster Energy. The reports did not prove a causal link between the drink and any health problems.\n\nIn May 2015, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) banned the sale of Monster and other energy drinks that contained both caffeine and ginseng.\n\nChristine Weick, a controversial and outspoken American Christian activist and author, created a video that argued that Monster Energy sports drinks is associated with Satan. The November 2014 video was published on YouTube, garnering over eleven million views as of 2018. The \"success\" of the video got her attention on Comedy Central's Tosh.0 Web Redemption.\n"}

Although originated in London, it is now produced in Scotland. It does not command a sizeable market share in its native market, but its largest market is in the United States, where it is the highest selling gin import, followed by southern Europe.\n\nTanqueray is a London dry gin; it is so called because of its distillation process, as well as originating in Bloomsbury, London. London dry gin is made by means of double distillation of grain. Botanicals are added during the second distillation. While the recipe is a closely guarded trade secret, it is known to contain four botanicals: juniper, coriander, angelica root, and liquorice.\n\nIt is one of Diageo's 16 \"strategic brands\" earmarked for prioritisation in promotion and distribution worldwide.\n\nTanqueray gin was initially distilled in 1830 by Charles Tanqueray in the Bloomsbury district of London. The retail outlet of Edward & Charles Tanqueray & Co was established on Vine Street, London, in 1838. When Charles died in 1868, his son Charles Waugh Tanqueray inherited the distillery, which continued to operate until it was severely damaged during World War II. The only facility to survive the Axis bombing, now known as \"Old Tom\", has since been moved to Cameron Bridge, Scotland.\n\nAccording to one report, Tanqueray became the highest selling gin in the world for the first time in 2016, with nearly three million nine-liter cases sold.\n\nTanqueray London Dry Gin is the original product that was launched in 1830; its key botanicals are juniper, coriander, angelica root and liquorice. It is variously sold as:\n\n\nTanqueray No. Ten (47.3%) was introduced in 2000 and is targeted at the martini market. It is distilled four times.\n\nTanqueray Sterling Vodka was introduced in 1989 and is available in both neutral and citrus flavours. Its main market is the United States.\n\nTanqueray Rangpur Gin was introduced in Maryland, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. in the summer of 2006. It has a strong citrus flavor, the result of rangpur limes, ginger, and bay leave being added during the final distillation process. It is produced at 82.6 proof (41.3% abv) and is now available throughout the United States.\n\nTanqueray Malacca Gin was introduced in 1997 as a \"wetter\" alternative to the London Dry, with more sweetness and a stronger fruit palate (most notably grapefruit). Discontinued in 2001, Diageo announced on 12 December 2012 (12/12/12) that a 16,000-case limited edition of Tanqueray Malacca would be relaunched in the US, Great Britain, and Western Europe for February 2013.\n\nPast offerings from Tanqueray also include both orange and lemon gins, produced from 1937 until 1957, when both were phased out.\n\nNotable spirit ratings for Tanqueray included a string of Double Golds (for its basic London Dry) for 2005–2007 from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Later years' competitions saw Tanqueray win a string of silver medals and then another double gold in 2012. Wine Enthusiast rated the London Dry in its \"96–100\" category in 2007 but gave it a \"90–95\" in 2011.\n\nTanqueray introduced \"Mr. Jenkins,\" a white-haired, well-dressed spokes-character, in print ads in 1994. He was retired a few years later. In 2004 Tanqueray introduced “Tony Sinclair,” a younger, foppish hipster socialite spokes-character in television ads. Sinclair's catchphrase at the end of every commercial was “Ready to Tanqueray?” followed by a manic laugh. He was portrayed by Rodney Mason as a madcap socialite of Black British descent.\n\n\n"}

The top markets for Gordon's are (in descending order) the United Kingdom, the United States and Greece. It is owned by the British spirits company Diageo and, in the UK, is made at Cameron Bridge Distillery in Fife, Scotland (although flavourings may be added elsewhere). It is the world's best-selling London dry gin. Gordon's has been the UK's number one gin since the late 19th century. A 40% ABV version for the North American market is distilled in Canada.\n\nGordon's London Dry Gin was developed by Alexander Gordon, a Londoner of Scots descent. He opened a distillery in the Southwark area in 1769, later moving in 1786 to Clerkenwell. The \"Special London Dry Gin\" he developed proved successful, and its recipe remains unchanged to this day. Its popularity with the Royal Navy saw bottles of the product distributed all over the world.\n\nIn 1898 Gordon & Co. amalgamated with Charles Tanqueray & Co. to form Tanqueray Gordon & Co. All production moved to the Gordon's Goswell Road site. In 1899, Charles Gordon died, ending the family association with the company.\n\nIn 1904 the distinctive square-faced, green bottle for the home market was introduced. In 1906 Gordon's Sloe Gin went into production. The earliest evidence in recipe books for the production of Gordon's Special Old Tom was in 1921.\n\nIn 1922 Tanqueray Gordon & Co. was acquired by the Distillers Company. In 1924 Gordon's began production of a 'Ready-to-Serve' Shaker Cocktail range, each in an individual shaker bottle.\n\nIn 1925 Gordon's was awarded its first Royal Warrant by King George V. In 1929 Gordon's released an orange gin followed by a lemon variety in 1931.\n\nIn 1934 Gordon's opened its first distillery in the US, at Linden, New Jersey.\n\nBy 1962 at least it was the world's highest selling gin.\n\nIn 1984 British production was moved to Laindon in Essex. In 1998 production was moved to Fife in Scotland, where it remains to this day.\n\nFrom 2007-2011 then in 2014, British chef Gordon Ramsay was the commercial spokesman for Gordon's Gin.\n\nEvery label and bottle top of Gordon's gin bears a depiction of a wild boar. According to legend a member of Clan Gordon saved the King of Scotland from the animal while hunting.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, Gordon's gin is triple-distilled and contains juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, liquorice, orris root, orange and lemon peel, though the exact recipe has remained a closely guarded secret since 1769. It differed from others at the time in that it didn't add sugar, which made it a \"dry\" gin. It takes ten days' distillation after receiving the wheat to create a finished product of a bottle of Gordon's Gin.\n\nIn the UK Gordon's is sold in a green glass bottle, but in export markets it is sold in a clear bottle. Some airport duty-free shops sell it in plastic bottles in the 75cl size.\n\nGordon's is sold in several different strengths depending on the market. In the US, the strength is 40% ABV. Until 1992, the ABV in the UK was 40%, but it was reduced to 37.5% to bring Gordon's gin into line with other white spirits such as white rum and vodka, and also reduce production costs (the other leading brands of gin in the UK, Beefeater gin and Bombay Sapphire, are both 40% ABV in the UK). In continental Europe and in some duty-free stores, a 47.3% ABV version is available in addition to the 37.5% one, while in New Zealand and Australia, as of 2011, it is sold at 37.2% ABV, and in South Africa it is 43% ABV.\n\nIn addition to the main product line, Gordon's also produces a sloe gin; a vodka (US & Venezuela only), two alcopop variants, Space and Spark; three vodka liqueur variants, Cranberry, Parchita and Limon (Venezuela only) and a canned, pre-mixed gin and tonic as well as a canned Gordon's and Grapefruit (500ml - Russia only).\nOn 11 February 2013, Gordon's announced the release of Gordon's Crisp Cucumber, a flavoured gin, which blends the original gin with cucumber flavour. In early 2014, Gordon's Elderflower was added to their \"flavoured\" gin collection, and is made in much the same way, with a natural elderflower flavouring being added to the original recipe.\n\nIn August 2017, Gordon's began selling Gordons Pink, a pink colored gin flavored with several types of red berries.\n\n\nA range of pre-mixed drinks:\n\n\nGordon's Gin is specified by name in the recipe for the Vesper Cocktail given by James Bond in Ian Fleming's 1953 novel \"Casino Royale\".\n\nGordon's was Ernest Hemingway's favourite gin, which he claimed could \"fortify, mollify and cauterize practically all internal and external injuries\".\n\nIn the movie \"The African Queen\" Katharine Hepburn's character pours Humphrey Bogart's entire crate of Gordon's bottles into the river and floats away the empties.\n\nIn the 14th episode of the anime series \"\", towards the end of the episode, a hospital patient reveals that he snuck in a bottle of Gordon's Gin and the label was in its export colours.\n\n"}

In parts of South America, including Peru and Ecuador, it is referred to as cancha.\n\nCorn nuts are prepared by soaking whole corn kernels in water for three days, then deep-frying them in oil until they are hard and brittle.\nThe kernels are soaked because they shrink during the harvesting and cleaning process, and rehydration returns them to their original size.\n\nAlbert Holloway of Oakland, California introduced corn nuts to the United States in 1936. He originally sold them to tavern owners to be given away free to their patrons as a snack that would be great with beer, calling them Olin's Brown Jug Toasted Corn.\n\nHolloway later renamed his product CornNuts. After Holloway and his sons Maurice and Rich learned of a breed of corn grown in Cusco, Peru (often referred to as Cuzco corn) that grew large kernels (some said to have been bigger than a U.S. quarter coin), the company researched developing a hybrid of the Cusco corn that could be grown effectively in California. After a decade of research, the company introduced CornNuts made with the hybrid variety in 1964. CornNuts sold on the market today are no longer of the large Cusco corn size.\n\nThe most popular brand, CornNuts was owned by Holloway's original family company until the company was purchased by Nabisco in 1998. Cornnuts is a registered trademark of Kraft Foods. It is available in five flavors: Original, BBQ (barbecue-flavored), Chile Picante con Limon, Ranch, and Jalapeño Cheddar.\n\nA Filipino variant of corn nuts is \"cornick\". Compared to the American variety, cornick pieces are typically smaller and crispier. Garlic is the most common flavor of cornick, with other common flavors including: chili cheese, adobo, barbecue, lechón manok (also known as roasted chicken), and sweet. Major brands include Boy Bawang (literally \"Garlic Boy\" in Tagalog, commonly sold in small packets), Corn Bits, and Safari.\n\nA popular variety of cornick is the lighter, chicharrón-like \"chichacorn\", a semi-popped style of cornick using glutinous corn from the Ilocos Region which is treated with lime before frying.\n\nDiana, a snack company in El Salvador, makes a variety of corn-nut-like snacks. These are called \"elotitos\" in Spanish, or \"cornbits\". These come in a variety of seasonings, such as Lemon, Cheese and Chili, and Barbecue. These are sold throughout Central America.\n\n\n"}

In Khmer, \"kuy teav\" is properly pronounced but is often elided to (romanized as \"k'tieu\", \"katieu\", \"kateav\", etc.) due to the sesquisyllabic nature of the Khmer language.\n\n\"Kuy teav\" is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised garlic oil. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of oyster sauce, soy sauce and a pinch of sugar, the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as pork loaf, minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in \"kuy teav\"; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some dried shrimp for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\nIn Cambodia, \"kuy teav\" is still primarily a breakfast dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday. As the pork broth is intended to be subtle rather than spicy, a plethora of optional herbs and other aromatics is always presented, allowing the diner to adjust the textures and flavours of the dish to his or her liking. In fact, in Cambodia it is precisely the use of garnishes and condiments that defines the main flavour profile of the dish (garlic, limes and pepper are a common flavour trio in Cambodian cuisine), rather than the broth. The dish is served with garnishes that can include lettuce leaves, bean sprouts, fresh herbs (such as spring onions (scallions), sawtooth coriander and holy basil), crushed black kampot pepper, lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Many types of chilli (fresh, dried, pickled) and chilli sauce are also normally present at the table, to either add into the broth or to be used as a dipping sauce for the meat toppings, as well as soy sauce, fish sauce and sugar. \"Kuy teav\" is also sometimes eaten with deep fried breadsticks, similar to how the Cambodians would eat congee (rice porridge).\n\nMoreover, \"kuy teav\" may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (“dry” as opposed to “wet”) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of \"kuy teav\" is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city’s historical wealth and importance. \"Kuy teav Phnom Penh\" may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced pork belly, ground pork, pig’s blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), roast duck, Mekong River prawns, sliced fish cake and squid. Modern-day versions of \"kuy teav\" featuring beef, chicken or seafood (rather than the original pork broth) have also evolved, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish \"kuy teav\" remains the same.\n\n or is eaten in Vietnam as a breakfast dish.

The dish originates from the Jiangxi province of southern China, and is a specialty of Ningdu. The dish has become especially popular in Taiwan, being introduced to the island by the Hakka people.\n\nThere are several versions for the origins of sanbeiji. These stories often involve a cook who placed three cups of sauces into an earthenware pot and simmered it for a long time. One version is that of Wen Tianxiang, a national hero and Jiangxi native during the Song Dynasty. Wen was captured by the invading Yuan armies of Kublai Khan and tortured for 4-years during his imprisonment. It was during this time that a sympathetic prison warden cooked the dish for him (using these limited resources) before Wen Tianxiang's execution.\n\nThe dish derives its name from the three cups of sauces required. For each chicken, a cup each of soy sauce, rice wine (usually \"mijiu\" although it may be mixed with \"Shaoxing jiu\"), and sesame oil are added. Lin Shangquan, a famous chef in Taiwan, believes that the traditional recipe called for a cup each of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar, with added ginger, garlic, and basil.\n\nThe chicken, together with the sauces, is cooked in an earthenware pot on high heat for ten minutes, then on low heat to allow the sauces to be absorbed by the meat. \"Sanbeiji\" is served with no sauce; the dish is cooked until all the sauce evaporates and is absorbed by the chicken. When it is served at the table, the chicken should be sizzling—even popping—on the cusp of burning. This gives the chicken a crisper texture (and richer flavor) unlike most other Chinese or Taiwanese stewed dishes. The dish is then eaten with either steamed rice or rice congee.\n\nOther meats, such as pork or frog, can be substituted for chicken in this dish without detracting from the taste.\n\n"}

The mix of small pieces of meat and fat give the interior a grainy structure.\n\nTraditionally, lukanka salami is made of pork, veal, and spices (black pepper, cumin, salt), minced together and stuffed into a length of dried cow's intestine as a casing. After stuffing, the cylindrical salami is hung to dry for about 40 to 50 days in a well-ventilated location. In the process of drying, the salami is pressed to acquire its typical flat form. Lukanka is usually finely sliced and served cold as an appetizer or starter.\n\nThe taste qualities of lukanka depend on natural characteristics of the region it is produced in, and are formed under the influence of the typical microflora of the local geographic environment. There are several regions in Bulgaria well known for lukanka production. Most of these are located in central Bulgaria, at the foot of the Balkan mountain range, notably the Smyadovo, Panagyurishte, and Karlovo regions. \"\"Karlovska lukanka\"\" is a name protected on a local level by the Patent office of the Republic of Bulgaria for lukanka from the Karlovo region.

{"id": "1863603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863603", "title": "Abrahadabra", "text": "Abrahadabra\n\nAbrahadabra is a word that first publicly appeared in \"The Book of the Law\" (1904), the central sacred text of Thelema. Its author, Aleister Crowley, described it as \"the Word of the Aeon, which signifieth The Great Work accomplished.\" This is in reference to his belief that the writing of \"Liber Legis\" (another name for \"The Book of the Law\") heralded a new Aeon for mankind that was ruled by the god Ra-Hoor-Khuit (a form of Horus). Abrahadabra is, therefore, the \"magical formula\" of this new age. It is not to be confused with the Word of the Law of the Aeon, which is \"Thelema\", meaning \"Will\".\n\nCrowley replaced the 'C' in \"Abracadabra\" with an 'H', which the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in their Neophyte ritual linked with Breath and Life as well as with the god Horus. Aleister Crowley had taken the place of Horus or the Hierus officer in the Golden Dawn's Neophyte ritual, which means that he personally gave the response explaining the meaning of the letter 'H'.\n\nCrowley explains in his essay \"Gematria\" that he changed the magick word to include 'H' because of qabalistic methods. He appears to say that this happened before his January 1901 meeting with Oscar Eckenstein, one of his teachers. At this meeting, Eckenstein ordered Crowley to put aside magick for the moment, and to practice meditation or concentration. In \"Gematria\", Crowley says he took great interest in Abrahadabra, and its qabalistic number 418, at the time someone ordered him to \"abandon the study of magic and the Qabalah\". In the Book of Thoth, Crowley refers to Abrahadabra as a 'cypher' of the Great Work.\n\nThe word \"Abrahadabra\" appears repeatedly in the 1904 invocation of Horus that preceded the writing of \"Liber Legis\" and led to the founding of Thelema. It also appears in a May 1901 diary that Crowley published in \"The Equinox\".\n\nThe essay \"Gematria\" gives Hindu, Christian, and \"Unsectarian\" versions of the problem that Crowley intended this magick word to answer. He also gives a qabalistic equivalent for each phrasing, and a brief symbolic answer for each. The unsectarian version reads, \"I am the finite square; I wish to be one with the infinite circle.\" Its equivalent refers to \"the Cross of Extension\" and \"the infinite Rose.\" Crowley's numerological explanation of \"ABRAHADABRA\" focuses mainly on this last formulation and the answer to it.\n\n\"Abrahadabra\" is also referred to as the \"Word of Double Power\". More specifically, it represents the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm—represented by the pentagram and the hexagram, the rose and the cross, the circle and the square, the 5 and the 6 (etc.), as also called the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of one's Holy Guardian Angel. In \"Commentaries\" (1996), Crowley says that the word is a symbol of the \"establishment of the pillar or phallus of the Macrocosm...in the void of the Microcosm.\"\n\nAs with most things found in the mystical works of Aleister Crowley, the word \"Abrahadabra\" can be examined using the qabalistic method of gematria, which is a form of numerology, whereby correspondences are made based on numerical values.\n\n\nIn Aramaic this word roughly translates into \"I will create as I speak.\" (see Abracadabra)\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1865924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1865924", "title": "Geist", "text": "Geist\n\nGeist () is a German noun with a degree of importance in German philosophy. Its semantic field corresponds to English ghost, spirit, mind, intellect. Some English translators resort to using \"spirit/mind\" or \"spirit (mind)\" to help convey the meaning of the term. \n\n\"Geist\" is also a central concept in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's 1807 \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). Notable compounds, all associated with Hegel's view of world history of the late 18th century, include Weltgeist \"world-spirit\", Volksgeist \"national spirit\" and Zeitgeist \"spirit of the age\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" (masculine gender) continues Old High German \"geist\", attested as the translation of Latin \"spiritus\". \nIt is the direct cognate of English \"ghost\", from a West Germanic \"gaistaz\". Its derivation from a PIE root \"g̑heis-\" \"to be agitated, frightened\" suggests that the Germanic word originally referred to frightening (c.f. English ghastly) apparitions or ghosts, and may also have carried the connotation of \"ecstatic agitation, \"furor\"\" related to the cult of Germanic Mercury. \nAs the translation of biblical Latin \"spiritus\" (Greek πνεῦμα) \"spirit, breath\" the Germanic word acquires a Christian meaning from an early time, notably in reference to the Holy Spirit (Old English \"sē hālga gāst\" \"the Holy Ghost\", OHG \" ther heilago geist\", Modern German \"der Heilige Geist\").\nThe English word is in competition with Latinate \"spirit\" from the Middle English period, but its broader meaning is preserved well into the early modern period.\n\nThe German noun much like English \"spirit\" could refer to spooks or ghostly apparitions of the dead, to the religious concept, as in the Holy Spirit, as well as to the \"spirit of wine\", i.e. ethanol. \nHowever, its special meaning of \"mind, intellect\" never shared by English \"ghost\" is acquired only in the 18th century, under the influence of French \"esprit\".\nIn this sense it became extremely productive in the German language of the 18th century in general as well as in 18th-century German philosophy.\n\"Geist\" could now refer to the quality of intellectual brilliance, to wit, innovation, erudition, etc.\nIt is also in this time that the adjectival distinction of \"geistlich\" \"spiritual, pertaining to religion\" vs. \"geistig\" \"intellectual, pertaining to the mind\" begins to be made. Reference to spooks or ghosts is made by the adjective \"geisterhaft\" \"ghostly, spectral\".\n\nNumerous compounds are formed in the 18th to 19th centuries, some of them loan translations of French expressions, such as \"Geistesgegenwart\" = \"présence d'esprit\" (\"mental presence, acuity\"), \"Geistesabwesenheit\" = \"absence d’esprit\" (\"mental absence, distraction\"), \"geisteskrank\" \"mentally ill\", \"geistreich\" \"witty, intellectually brilliant\", \"geistlos\" \"unintelligent, unimaginative, vacuous\" etc. \nIt is from these developments that certain German compounds containing \"-geist\" have been loaned into English, such as \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nGerman \"Geist\" in this particular sense of \"mind, wit, erudition; intangible essence, spirit\" has no precise English-language equivalent, for which reason translators sometimes retain \"Geist\" as a German loanword.\n\n\"Geist\" is a central concept in Hegel's \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (\"Phänomenologie des Geistes\"). According to Hegel, the \"Weltgeist\" (\"world spirit\") is not an actual object or a transcendental, Godlike thing, but a means of philosophizing about history. \"Weltgeist\" is effected in history through the mediation of various \"Volksgeister\" (\"national spirits\"), the great men of history, such as Napoleon, are the \"concrete universal\".\n\nThis has led some to claim that Hegel favored the great man theory, although his philosophy of history, in particular concerning the role of the \"universal state\" (\"Universalstaat\", which means a universal \"order\" or \"statute\" rather than \"state\"), and of an \"End of History\" is much more complex.\n\nFor Hegel, the great hero is unwittingly utilized by \"Geist\" or \"absolute spirit\", by a \"ruse of reason\" as he puts it, and is irrelevant to history once his historic mission is accomplished; he is thus subjected to the teleological principle of history, a principle which allows Hegel to reread the history of philosophy as culminating in his philosophy of history.\n\n\"Weltgeist\", the world spirit concept, designates an idealistic principle of world explanation, which can be found from the beginnings of philosophy up to more recent time. The concept of world spirit was already accepted by the idealistic schools of ancient Indian philosophy, whereby one explained objective reality as its product. (See metaphysical objectivism) In the early philosophy of Greek antiquity, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle all paid homage, amongst other things, to the concept of world spirit. Hegel later based his philosophy of history on it.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\" is older than the 18th century, at first (16th century) in the sense of \"secularism, impiety, irreligiosity\" (\"spiritus mundi\"), in the 17th century also personalised in the sense of \"man of the world\", \"mundane or secular person\".\nAlso from the 17th century, \"Weltgeist\" acquired a philosophical or spiritual sense of \"world-spirit\" or \"world-soul\" (\"anima mundi, spiritus universi\") in the sense of Panentheism, a spiritual essence permeating all of nature, or the active principle animating the universe, including the physical sense, such as the attraction between magnet and iron or between Moon and tide.\n\nThis idea of \"Weltgeist\" in the sense of \"anima mundi\" became very influential in 18th-century German philosophy. In philosophical contexts, \"der Geist\" on its own could refer to this concept, as in Christian Thomasius, \"Versuch vom Wesen des Geistes\" (1709).\nBelief in a \"Weltgeist\" as animating principle immanent to the universe became dominant in German thought due to the influence of Goethe, in the later part of the 18th century.\n\nAlready in the poetical language of Johann Ulrich von König (d. 1745), the \"Weltgeist\" \nappears as the active, masculine principle opposite the feminine principle of Nature.\n\n\"Weltgeist\" in the sense of Goethe comes close to being a synonym of God and can be attributed agency and will. \nHerder, who tended to prefer the form \"Weltengeist\" (as it were \"spirit of worlds\"), pushes this to the point of composing prayers addressed to this world-spirit:\nThe term was notably embraced by Hegel and his followers in the early 19th century.\nFor the 19th century, the term as used by Hegel (1807) became prevalent, less in the sense of an animating principle of nature or the universe but as the invisible force advancing world history:\n\nHegel's description of Napoleon as \"the world-soul on horseback\" (\"die Weltseele zu Pferde\") became proverbial.\nThe phrase is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in a letter written on 13 October 1806, the day before the Battle of Jena, to his friend Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer:\nI saw the Emperor – this world-soul – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.\n\nThe letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859.\nIt is used without attribution by Meyer Kayserling in his \"Sephardim\" (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in \"Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen\", who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's \"bad jokes\" (\"schlechte Witze\").\nThe phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century.\n\n\"Volksgeist\" or \"Nationalgeist\" refers to a \"spirit\" of an individual people (\"Volk\"), its \"national spirit\" or \"national character\".\nThe term \"Nationalgeist\" is used in the 1760s by Justus Möser and by Johann Gottfried Herder. The term \"Nation\" at this time is used in the sense of \"natio\" \"nation, ethnic group, race\", mostly replaced by the term \"Volk\" after 1800.\nIn the early 19th century, the term \"Volksgeist\" was used by Friedrich Carl von Savigny in order to express the \"popular\" sense of justice.\nSavigniy explicitly referred to the concept of an \"esprit des nations \" used by Voltaire. and of the \"esprit général\" invoked by Montesquieu.\n\nHegel uses the term in his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of History\".\nBased on the Hegelian use of the term, Wilhelm Wundt, Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal in the mid-19th-century established the field of \"Völkerpsychologie\" (\"psychology of nations\").\n\nIn Germany the concept of Volksgeist has developed and changed its meaning through eras and fields. The most important examples are: In the literary field, Schlegel and the Brothers Grimm. In the history of cultures, Herder. In the history of the State or political history, Hegel. In the field of law, Savigny and in the field of psychology Wundt. This means that the concept is ambiguous. Furthermore it is not limited to Romanticism as it is commonly known.\nThe concept of was also influential in American cultural anthropology. According to the historian of anthropology George W. Stocking, Jr., \"… one may trace the later American anthropological idea of culture back through Bastian's Volkergedanken and the folk psychologist's Volksgeister to Wilhelm von Humboldt's Nationalcharakter -- and behind that, although not without a paradoxical and portentous residue of conceptual and ideological ambiguity, to the Herderian ideal of Volksgeist.\"\n\nThe compound \"Zeitgeist\" (;, \"spirit of the age\" or \"spirit of the times\") similarly to \"Weltgeist\" describes \nan invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.\nThe term is now mostly associated with Hegel, contrasting with Hegel's use of \"Volksgeist\" \"national spirit\" and \"Weltgeist\" \"world-spirit\", \nbut its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to Herder and Goethe.\nThe term as used contemporarily may more pragmatically refer to a fashion or fad which prescribes what is acceptable or tasteful, e.g. in the field of architecture.\n\nHegel in \"Phenomenology of the Spirit\" (1807) uses both \"Weltgeist\" and \"Volksgeist\" but prefers the phrase \"Geist der Zeiten\" \"spirit of the times\" over the compound \"Zeitgeist\".\n\nHegel believed that culture and art reflected its time. Thus, he argued that it would be impossible to produce classical art in the modern world, as modernity is essentially a \"free and ethical culture\".\n\nThe term has also been used more widely in the sense of an intellectual or aesthetic fashion or fad.\nFor example, Charles Darwin's 1859 proposition that evolution occurs by natural selection has been cited as a case of the \"zeitgeist\" of the epoch, an idea \"whose time had come\", seeing that his contemporary, Alfred Russel Wallace, was outlining similar models during the same period. \nSimilarly, intellectual fashions such as the emergence of logical positivism in the 1920s, leading to a focus on behaviorism and blank-slatism over the following decades, and later, during the 1950s to 1960s, the shift from behaviorism to post-modernism and critical theory can be argued to be an expression of the intellectual or academic \"zeitgeist\".\n\"Zeitgeist\" in more recent usage has been used by Forsyth (2009) in reference to his \"theory of leadership\" and in other publications describing models of business or industry.\nMalcolm Gladwell argued in his book \"Outliers\" that entrepreneurs who succeeded in the early stages of a nascent industry often share similar characteristics.\n\n\n\n"}

Preparation of traditional cochinita involves marinating the meat in strongly acidic citrus juice, seasoning it with annatto seed which imparts a vivid burnt orange color, and roasting the meat while it is wrapped in banana leaf.\n\n\"Cochinita\" means baby pig, so true cochinita pibil involves roasting a whole suckling pig. Alternatively, pork shoulder (butt roast), or pork loin is used in many recipes. The high acid content of the marinade and the slow cooking time tenderizes the meat, allowing otherwise tough pieces of meat to be used. The Yucatecan recipes always employ the juice of Seville or bitter oranges for marinating. In areas where bitter oranges are not common, juice of sweet oranges combined with lemons, limes, or vinegar are employed to approximate the effect of the bitter orange on the meat. Another important ingredient in all pibil recipes is achiote (annatto), which gives the dish its characteristic color and adds to flavor.\nIt is usually eaten with side dishes such as: yellow corn tortillas, red pickled onion, refried black beans and habanero chilies. \nTraditionally, cochinita pibil is buried in a pit with a fire at the bottom to roast it.\n\nCochinita pibil is a recurring element of the movie \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" directed by Robert Rodriguez, where it is the favorite food of a CIA agent played by Johnny Depp, who orders this dish every time he enters a Mexican restaurant and urges every person he has lunch with to taste it. He will go as far as killing a cook because his puerco pibil is \"too good\". \n\nRodriguez also includes a recipe for puerco pibil and demonstrates how to prepare it in the special features section of the DVD.\n\n\n"}

Vitasoy (an unrelated company) also produces a cola beverage branded as Vita Cola.\n\nVita Cola started out in the German Democratic Republic. Introduced in 1957, it was advertised as \"Brauselimonade mit Frucht- und Kräutergeschmack\" (carbonated soft drink with fruit and herb flavoring), using a formula that is still kept secret (similar to Coca-Cola's \"Merchandise 7X\" formula). At its peak, Vita Cola was bottled in over 200 factories.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall and Iron Curtain in 1989, Vita Cola's business quickly collapsed as Western cola brands took its place.

They traditionally take place in May during graduation.\n\nCapping stunts have a long tradition in New Zealand, and are a prominent event at and around campuses throughout the country with many notable instances reaching national or local headlines.\n\nThe stunts commonly play on the accepted civil rules of the host city with the local city councils or media as the target. The capping stunts that generate the most media exposure generally involve passive techniques such as letter writing; however, material pranks such as the suspension of inflatable genitals from university property are common.\n\nA frequently referenced stunt is the Victoria University stunt where local workmen were told students dressed as police were planning a fake arrest, while local police were told students dressed as workmen were planning to dig up the road. This stunt encompasses all key elements.\n\nCapping stunts are also carried out in revenge. For example, in 1952 University of Otago students, tired of being misrepresented by the Otago Daily Times, perpetrated a nationwide UFO hoax in order to display the shortcomings of the local paper.\n\nOccasionally capping stunts will prey on other students, particularly those in their first year of study. In May 2004 a Massey University stunt involved staging auditions for extras in Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\". After advertising the auditions in the student newspaper, over 200 students auditioned for a part. Each signed a disclaimer which included \"I also understand that TheatreRecruitment does not guarantee part in any movie, but will endeavor to act in the best interests of entertainment\".\n\nThe most notable recent suspected capping stunt was the Waiheke Island foot and mouth disease threat of May 2005, which was suspected to be a stunt by Massey University in Palmerston North. A letter was sent to Prime Minister Helen Clark stating that the disease had been released onto the island. Police said that the letter came from the Manawatu Region, and coincided with graduation week.\n\n\n"}

It is made by putting cheese and sliced ham between two slices of bread. The bread is sometimes buttered and/or toasted. Vegetables like lettuce, tomato, onion or pickle slices can also be included. Various kinds of mustard and mayonnaise are also common.\n\nSliced bread, sliced cheese, and sliced cooked ham are very readily available in Western supermarkets and as a result ham and cheese sandwiches are quick and easy to prepare. They are a common component of a packed lunch.\n\nAs recalled by ballpark concessionaire Harry Stevens in a 1924 interview, in 1894 ham and cheese sandwiches were the only food sold in New York baseball parks; frankfurters were introduced in 1909.\n\nAn Englishwoman, writing in 1923 of her passage through Ellis Island on a trip to the U.S., noted:\n\nRichard E. Byrd took ham and cheese sandwiches on his 1926 polar flight as did 1927 transatlantic fliers Chamberlin and Levine.\n\nThe origin of the ham and cheese sandwich has been debated for a number of years by culinary intellectuals. The leading theory as to who first started to produce a ham, cheese and bread dish is mentioned in \"The Larousse Gastronomique 1961\". Here it notes that Patrick Connolly, an 18th-century Irish immigrant to England, sold a bread dish which:\n\n\"combined the remains of pig, cured and sliced with a topping of Leicester cheese and a kiss of egg yolk sauce (a form of mayonnaise) in a round bread roll. The dish was rather unimaginatively known as a Connolly and is still sometimes referred to as this in some parts of the Midlands in the UK.\"\n\nIn the UK, a common addition to a ham and cheese sandwich is pickle (a sweet, vinegary chutney originally by Branston); the snack is then known as a ham, cheese and pickle sandwich.\n\nIn French cuisine, a croque-monsieur is a type of ham and cheese sandwich. It is topped with cheese and baked or fried.\n\n"}

{"id": "1884352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1884352", "title": "Chesed", "text": "Chesed\n\nChesed (, also Romanized \"ḥesed\") is a Hebrew word.\n\nIn its positive sense, the word is used of kindness or love between people, of piety of people towards God as well as of love or mercy of God towards humanity. It is frequently used in Psalms in the latter sense, where it is traditionally translated \"lovingkindness\" in English translations.\n\nIn Jewish theology it is likewise used of God's love for the Children of Israel, and in Jewish ethics it is used for love or charity between people. Chesed in this latter sense of \"charity\" is considered a virtue on its own, and also for its contribution to \"tikkun olam\" (repairing the world). It is also considered the foundation of many religious commandments practiced by traditional Jews, especially interpersonal commandments. \n\n\"Chesed\" is also one of the ten Sephirot on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is given the association of kindness and love, and is the first of the emotive attributes of the \"sephirot\".\n\nThe root \"chasad\" has a primary meaning of \"eager and ardent desire\", used both in the sense \"good, kind\" and \"shame, contempt\". The noun \"chesed\" inherits both senses, on one hand \"zeal, love, kindness towards someone\" and on the other \"zeal, ardour against someone; envy, reproach\". In its positive is used of mutual benevolence, mercy or pity between people, of piety of people towards God, as well as grace, favour or mercy of God towards people.\n\nIt occurs 248 times in the Hebrew Bible. In the majority of cases (149 times), the King James Bible translation is \"mercy\", following LXX \"eleos\". Less frequent translations are: \"kindness\" (40 times), \"lovingkindness\" (30 times), \"goodness\" (12 times), \"kindly\" (5 times), \"merciful\" (4 times), \"favour\" (3 times) and \"good\", \"goodliness\", \"pity\" (once each).\nOnly two instances of the noun in its negative sense are in the text, translated \"reproach\" in Psalm 57:3, and \"wicked thing\" in Leviticus 20:17.\n\nThe translation of \"loving kindness\" in KJV is derived from the Coverdale Bible of 1535. This particular translation is used exclusively of \"chesed\" used of the benign attitude of YHWH (\"the \") or Elohim (\"God\") towards his chosen, primarily invoked in Psalms (23 times), but also in the prophets, four times in Jeremiah, twice in Isaiah 63:7 and once in Hosea 2:19. While \"lovingkindness\" is now considered somewhat archaic, it is part of the traditional rendition of Psalms in English Bible translations. Some more recent translations use \"steadfast love\" where KJV has \"lovingkindness\".\n\nThe Septuagint has \"mega eleos\" \"great mercy\", rendered as Latin \"misericordia\".\nAs an example of the use of \"chesed\" in Psalms, consider its notable occurrence at the beginning of Psalm 51 (, lit. \"be favourable to me, Elohim, as your chesed\"):\nIn Judaism, \"love\" is often used as a shorter English translation. Political theorist Daniel Elazar has suggested that \"chesed\" cannot easily be translated into English, but that it means something like \"loving covenant obligation\". Other suggestions include \"grace\" and \"compassion\".\n\nIn traditional musar literature (ethical literature), chesed is one of the primary virtues. The tannaic rabbi Simon the Just taught: \"The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and bestowing kindness\" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). Chesed is here the core ethical virtue.\n\nA statement by Rabbi Simlai in the Talmud claims that \"The Torah begins with chesed and ends with chesed.\" This may be understood to mean that \"the entire Torah is characterized by chesed, i.e. it sets forth a vision of the ideal life whose goals are behavior characterized by mercy and compassion.\" Alternatively, it may allude to the idea that the giving of the Torah itself is the quintessential act of chesed.\n\nIn Moses ben Jacob Cordovero's kabbalistic treatise \"Tomer Devorah\", the following are actions undertaken in imitation of the qualities of Chesed:\n\nA person who embodies \"chesed\" is known as a \"chasid\" (hasid, חסיד), one who is faithful to the covenant and who goes \"above and beyond that which is normally required\" and a number of groups throughout Jewish history which focus on going \"above and beyond\" have called themselves \"chasidim\". These groups include the Hasideans of the Second Temple period, the Maimonidean Hasidim of medieval Egypt and Palestine, the Chassidei Ashkenaz in medieval Europe, and the Hasidic movement which emerged in eighteenth century Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, חסד can take the generic meaning of \"charity\", and a \"chesed institution\" in modern Judaism \nmay refer to any charitable organization run by religious Jewish groups or individuals.\nCharitable organizations described as \"chesed institutions\" include:\n\nThe first three of the ten \"sephirot\" are the attributes of the intellect, while \"chesed\" is the first \"sephira\" of the attribute of action. In the kabbalistic Tree of life, its position is below Chokhmah, across from Gevurah and above Netzach. It is usually given four paths: to \"chokhmah\", \"gevurah\", \"tiphereth\", and \"netzach\" (some Kabbalists place a path from \"chesed\" to \"binah\" as well.)\n\nThe \"Bahir\" states, \"What is the fourth (utterance): The fourth is the righteousness of God, His mercies and kindness with the entire world. This is the right hand of God.\" Chesed manifests God's absolute, unlimited benevolence and kindness.\n\nThe angelic order of this sphere is the Hashmallim, ruled by the Archangel Zadkiel. The opposing Qliphah is represented by the demonic order Gamchicoth, ruled by the Archdemon Astaroth.\n\n"}

It was created by Zheng Chunfa, celebrated chef and proprietor of the Ju Chun Yuan Restaurant in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. Zheng was private chef of a senior local official in his early years. Since its creation during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the dish has been regarded as a Chinese delicacy known for its rich taste, and special manner of cooking. The dish's name is an allusion to the dish's ability to entice the vegetarian monks from their temples to partake in the meat-based dish. It is high in protein and calcium.\n\nConcerns over the sustainability and welfare of sharks have limited consumption and availability of the soup.\n\nThe soup or stew consists of many ingredients, especially animal products, and requires one to two full days to prepare. A typical recipe requires many ingredients including quail eggs, bamboo shoots, scallops, sea cucumber, abalone, shark fin, fish maw, chicken, Jinhua ham, pork tendon, ginseng, mushrooms, and taro. Some recipes require up to thirty main ingredients and twelve condiments. Use of shark fin, which is sometimes harvested by shark finning, and abalone, which is implicated in destructive fishing practices, are controversial for both environmental and ethical reasons.\n\nThere are many stories on the origin of the dish. A common one is about a scholar traveling by foot during the Qing dynasty. While he traveled with his friends, the scholar preserved all his food for the journey in a clay jar used for holding wine. Whenever he had a meal, he warmed up the jar with the ingredients over an open fire. Once they arrived in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, the scholar started cooking the dish. The smells spread over to a nearby Buddhist monastery where monks were meditating. Although monks are not allowed to eat meat, one of the monks, tempted, jumped over the wall. A poet among the travelers said that even Buddha would jump the wall to eat the delicious dish.\n\nIn South Korea, the dish is known as \"Buldojang\" (불도장, the Korean reading of the same Chinese characters). It was first introduced in 1987 by Hu Deok-juk (), an ethnic Chinese chef from Taiwan at the Chinese restaurant Palsun (팔선), located in the Shilla Hotel in Seoul. The dish played an important role in changing the mainstream of Chinese cuisine consumed in South Korea from Sichuan cuisine to Cantonese cuisine. However, in 1989, the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism, strongly opposed the selling of the dish because the name is considered a blasphemy to Buddhism. Although \"Buldojang\" temporarily disappeared, the dispute ignited the spreading of rumors among the public, and the dish consequently gained popularity. When President Moon Jae-in visited China, it was served at the state dinner.\n\nKai Mayfair in London was dubbed \"home of the world's most expensive soup\" when it unveiled its £108 version of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in 2005. The dish includes shark's fin, Japanese flower mushroom, sea cucumber, dried scallops, chicken, Hunan ham, pork, and ginseng.\n\n"}

The idea of Pakola came from its founder Haji Ali Mohammad, who dreamed of developing a drink that portrayed the true reflection and taste of Pakistan. In order to pursue his dream, Haji Ali Mohammad opened a small factory with only two machines at Lawrence Road in Karachi with Pakola Ice-cream Soda being the initial product. \n\nThe drink was launched at Pakistan Air Force Base on the day of Pakistan's Independence, 14 August 1950, in the presence of the 1st Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan. Since then, Pakola has made an enduring association between itself as a brand and the country. \n\nLater when Pakistan Beverages (PB) came into existence at SITE Karachi, the brand Pakola was produced there. In 1979 when Pakistan Beverages was announced as a production facility for PEPSI, Mehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited came into existence and continued to produce the drink along with other products like Apple Sidra and Bubble Up.\n\nMehran Bottlers (Pvt.) Limited was managed by his nephews late Zafar Habib and Arif Habib. In 2004, Mehran Bottlers and Pakistan Beverages started manufacturing cans in Pakistan. \n\nLater, in 2004, Zeeshan Z. Habib took charge as the chief executive officer of Mehran Bottlers. He joined the family business soon after he graduated from The Manchester Metropolitan University. Mehran Bottlers is now among the few companies that are certified HALAL, HACCP, ISO and by the FDA. Owning to his leadership, Pakola is one of the most successful brands in Pakistan. Pakola aimed to connect Pakistani hearts and minds with the national spirit, using the slogan \"Dil Bola Pakola\".\nIn 2007, with the exception of Karachi, the Teli family gave the franchise rights of Pakola to the Leghari family who previously owned Pepsi Sukkur. The Leghari family has the right to sell Pakola nationally with the exception of Karachi, while all exports are done from the Karachi plant. \n\nPakola is one of the benchmark brands directly associated with the image of Pakistan. As per its slogan \"Dil Bola Pakola,\" Pakola is associated with Pakistani nationalism. \n\nSince the company's founding, many beverages have been introduced in the local as well as the international market, but none have overtaken the original Pakola drink. For many who grew up in the 1980s and 90s, Pakola evokes intense nostalgia whenever they see the brand. \n\nSeveral of the variants that have been introduced by Pakola:\n\n\nPakola is made with carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, Cream Soda Artificial Flavor, Color: FD&C Bleu No 1 (E 133), FD&C Yellow No.5 (E 102), and Sodium Benzoate. A typical can of Pakola (8.5 fl ounces/250 ml) has 33 g of sugar, 15 mg of sodium, 0 g of cholesterol, 0 g fat, 0 g of protein, and 130 calories.\n\nPakola is currently produced by two companies, Mehran Bottlers Limited and Gul Bottlers. \n\nPakola is now available in America, Africa, Australia, Canada, Middle East, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It the only carbonated beverage manufactured in Pakistan that is exported globally. \n\nDue to the introduction of the capacity tax in 2013, Pakola discontinued the production and distribution of all glass-bottled products. The tax was levied on the overall production and distribution of the machinery instead of output, which was detrimental for companies with lower productions or smaller markets. After the collapse of this system, Mehran Bottlers quickly set up their PET lines to grasp the market once again.\n\n\nTo appeal the younger audience in terms of message and appearance, Pakola has revamped itself through different campaigns in recent years. \n\nBy launching its Limited Edition Azaadi cans in 2017, Pakola celebrated freedom and joy with Pakistan. The cans paid tribute to Quaid-e-Azam Mohd Ali Jinnah, also showcasing the flag of Pakistan and incorporating a truck art peacock motif on the cans, emphasizing the brand as being a drink of Pakistan. These cans had their own attraction and uniqueness defined amongst consumers, which created a buzz throughout social media including the hashtags #PakolaAurPakistan and #70thBirthday. \n\n\nIn 2018, Pakola launched Limited Edition cans to celebrate Pakistani Culture. These cans depicted passion, craze, patriotism and love for Pakistan. \nEach can depicted stories exhibiting the message of peace and harmony, beautifully portraying the Pakistani culture through truck art, sharing the love for folk music, displaying favourite sports, and honoring Pakistan's armed forces. \n\n\nA TVC was conceptualized on the theme from Retro to Contemporary. It aimed to take viewers through a nostalgic journey from their early days to the present, to invoke nostalgic feelings, while showing that the quality and fondness of Pakola has still remained the same. \n\n"}

Despite the chart success of the album and its singles, only \"Amnesty is Granted\" has appeared on an official live album, \"Casa De Carne (Live 2008)\" as a bonus CD with \"Hang Cool Teddy Bear\". \"I'd Lie for You (And That's the Truth)\" was recorded as a sound check with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, but only included as a bonus download track.\n\nOf the twelve songs on the album, two are written by Jim Steinman. Both are covers, the \"Original Sin\" from Pandora's Box's \"Original Sin\" album (it was also heard in the movie \"The Shadow\", where it was performed by Taylor Dayne) and \"Left in the Dark\" first appeared on Steinman's own album \"Bad for Good\". The first two singles are written by Diane Warren, who later also wrote songs for Meat Loaf's albums \"Couldn't Have Said It Better\" and \"\".\n\nThe theme on the cover art and inside booklet is that of detective novels of the 1950s. The booklet, aside from having the lyrics for every song, features a \"Detective Novel\" per song with modified titles to accommodate the titles of the songs. At least one image, the one associated with \"Where Angels Sing\" (the final track on the album), is easily recognizable: it is the same image, only with slightly altered colors, as in the movie poster for \"Lolita\", Stanley Kubrick's film adaption of the controversial same-titled novel by Vladimir Nabokov; the typeface used to write \"Where Angels Sing\" is also the same one as in the poster. This style was also used for the three singles released off the album, with the cover art for each of them being its correspondent novel from the booklet.\n\nIn 2011, a three disc collector's edition was released. The first disc included the songs on the original release with four additional tracks.\nThe second disk was recorded live at the Beacon Theatre 23-October-1995 except tracks 10 and 11 (recorded in 1989).\nThe third disk is a five track DVD.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As not many records exist from the ancient monarchies of Xinjiang the study of its coinage has determined when which rules reigned and the state of the economy based on metallurgical analyses.\n\nAmong the earliest coins made in the Tarim Basin were the so-called \"horse coins\" of the \"Yu Tian\" kingdom near modern Hotan, also known as the \"Sino-Kharosthi coins of Khotan\". These were struck around the second and third centuries with a horse image on one side and legends in Han (Chinese) and Kharosthi scripts. \n\nCoins with both Chinese and Karoshthi inscriptions have been found in the southern Tarim Basin.\n\nCast coins made in imitation of Chinese coins were also produced in the Tarim Basin. The kingdom of Qiuzi (near modern Kucha) produced coins similar to the Chinese \"Wu Zhu\" pieces. (See: Kucha coinage)\n\nIn the Chu valley in Central Asia Tang dynasty era Chinese coins continued to be copied and minted after the Chinese left the area.\n\nAn indelible impression was left on eastern Xinjiang's administration and culture in Turfan by the Chinese Tang rule which consisted of settlements, and military farms in addition to the spread of Chinese influence such as the sancai three colour glaze in Central Asia and Western Eurasia, in Xinjiang there was continued circulation of Chinese coins.\n\nThe title Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-Ṣīn was bestowed by the 'Abbāsid Caliph upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarqand Khaqan Yūsuf b. Ḥasan and after that coins and literature had the title Tamghaj Khan appear on them and were continued to be used by the Qarakhanids and the Transoxania-based Western Qarakhanids and some Eastern Qarakhanid monarchs, so therefore the Kara-Khitan (Western Liao)'s usage of Chinese things such as Chinese coins, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, Chinese art products like porcelein, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs were designed to appearl to the local Central Asian Muslim population since the Muslims in the area regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed links with China as prestigious and Western Liao's rule over Muslim Central Asia caused the view that Central Asia was a Chinese territory to reinforce upon the Muslims; \"Turkestan\" and Chīn (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dīn Mubārak Shāh with China being identified as the country where the cities of Balāsāghūn and Kashghar were located.\n\nMuslim writers wrote that \"Tamghājī silver coins\" (sawmhā-yi ṭamghājī) were present in Balkh while tafghājī was used by the writer Ḥabībī, the Qarakhānid leader Böri Tigin (Ibrāhīm Tamghāj Khān) was possibly the one who minted the coins.\n\nIn the Turfan Basin, the Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho also cast coins in Chinese style, but with Old Uyghur language legends. The preceding city-state of Gaochang made its own coins in Chinese style, with the legend \"Gao Chang Ji Li\" (高昌吉利, \"Gāochāng jí lì\").\n\nIn the Tarim Basin, (in present-day Xinjiang), Islamic, Arabic-language coins were struck under the Kara-Khanid Khanate, Chagatai Khanate, Sayyidiya (Yarkand or Moghul Khanate), and even by the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate. The Dzungars minted pūl (a red copper coin).\n\nChina's Qing (Manchu) dynasty began casting coins in the far-Western region of \"Xinjiang\" (Chinese for \"The New Frontier\", sometimes transliterated as \"Sinkiang\") in 1760, only one year after the Qianlong Emperor's generals conquered the region's capitols of Kashgar and Yarkand. Not only did this primarily Muslim and Turkic-speaking region represent a distinct cultural landscape for the empire, but also a special economic environment. The many differences between the coinages of Xinjiang and the rest of China reflected the special demands of governing this area. The coins cast in Xinjiang were made from copper, rather than the brass used for the rest of the empire's coinage, leading to the nickname \"red cash.\" These copper coins were valued at five of the standard cash, and provided some continuity with the monetary system used under the region's previous rulers, the Dzungar Oirat Mongol Dzungar Khanate. Most of the red cash also displayed mint names in the local Turki language. The coins had writing in Chinese, Manchu, and Turki. Lying far from the empire's center, Xinjiang was somewhat loosely governed by the court, and this is reflected in the great variety of coin types produced, some of them quite innovative. In spite of frequent rebellions and invasions, the coinage of red cash continued on and off through the nineteenth century and into the beginning of the twentieth. The final examples of red cash were cast in 1909 in the name of the Last Emperor, Puyi, using the same casting technology employed by Chinese mints for 2,000 years.\n\nThe red cash of Xinjiang are quite popular among Chinese collectors for their abundance of unusual types, and for their connection to the \"Silk Road\" and \"Western Regions\" history/mythology. Some of the coins of Qing Xinjiang represent surprising breaks from Chinese coinage traditions. Most types are trilingual, and errors were abundant. Among the numerous types of red cash there are both great rarities and common pieces with strong historical significance.\n\nMachine-struck coins were introduced in the late 19th century and at first were produced alongside the cast coins.\n\n\n"}

In the ancient Indian texts, dharma-yuddha refers to a war that is fought while following several rules that make the war fair.\n\nFor instance, in a righteous war, equals fight equals. Chariot warriors are not supposed to attack cavalry and infantry, those on elephants are not supposed to attack infantry, and so on. The rules also forbid the usage of celestial weapons (divine weapons bestowed by the gods) on ordinary soldiers (as opposed to soldiers of noble birth). The build-up of weapons and armies is done with the full knowledge of the opposing side and no surprise attacks are made. \n\nThe rules of engagement also set out how warriors were to deal with noncombatants. No one should attack an enemy who has temporarily lost or dropped their weapon. The lives of women, prisoners of war, and farmers were also sacred. Pillaging the land was forbidden. \n\nDharma-yuddha also signifies that the war is not fought for gain or selfish reasons. A dharma-yuddha is waged to uphold the principles of righteousness. \n\nIn the \"Mahabharata\" epic, which describes the Kurukshetra war, the two sides agree on the following rules: \n\n\nBeyond the \"Mahabharata\", the principles of dharma-yuddha are referred to in many other ancient Indian texts, including the \"Ramayana\" and the Dharmashastras or law texts.\n\n\n"}

Rahner; July 23, 1919 – January 21, 2004) was a staple of Chicago children's television in the 1960s and 1970s on WGN-TV.\n\nRayner (the name was initially spelled \"Rahner\" but pronounced \"Rayner\") grew up in Queens, New York. He attended College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts; his first media job was working for WGBB radio in Freeport on Long Island while he was attending night school at Fordham University.\n\nHe enlisted in the Army Air Corps, serving as the navigator of a B-17 during World War II, when he was shot down over France April 3, 1943. During years as a POW in Stalag Luft III, he helped prepare the escape depicted in the film \"The Great Escape\"—though he was transferred to another camp before the escape took place. It was during his time as a POW that he discovered his talent for entertaining, namely through his fellow prisoners and his German captors. He was interviewed in a documentary titled Stalag Luft III, produced by RDR Productions of Glenview, Illinois.\n\nAfter briefly working in radio in Grand Rapids, Michigan on WOOD Radio as well as New York and Dayton, Ohio radio following the war, Rayner joined what was then WBKB but later became WLS-TV in Chicago as a staff announcer; he also worked on a local morning program called \"Rayner Shine\" in 1953. This was Rayner's first work with puppets, who were provided for the show by the Mulqueens. He got a noontime program called \"The Ray Rayner Show\" in 1953, he and his co-host Mina Kolb hosted a somewhat free form show that featured music, comedy skits, dance and pantomime. The show, geared towards teens, ran for five years.\n\nWBBM asked Rayner to switch to a children's program in 1958, though reluctant at first, he did so with \"The Little Show\", which was very much like \"Ray Rayner and His Friends\"; on this version, the duck he worked with had the name of Havelock. It ran two years; he also hosted \"Popeye's Firehouse\" (as Chief Abernathy) for another two. He moved to WGN-TV in 1961.\n\nHis first role on WGN was as Sergeant Pettibone, the host of the \"Dick Tracy\" show. He joined the cast of \"Bozo's Circus\" as country bumpkin clown Oliver O. Oliver. By 1965, Rayner's clown character, along with \"Sandy\", played by Don Sandburg, were added to Larry Harmon's Bozo coloring books. Rayner left the show in 1971 because he wanted more time for other projects. After that, he occasionally appeared on the show as Oliver and filled in for Ned Locke as \"Mr. Ray\" when needed. Following the cancellation of \"Dick Tracy\", a new afternoon program called \"Rocket to Adventure\" ran until 1968; this featured early appearances by Gigantor and Tobor the Eighth Man. Rayner hosted the show appearing as an astronaut. In 1968, he also appeared in television commercials for McDonald's as Ronald McDonald. At one point, WGN-TV had enough hope in being able to syndicate Rayner's Dick Tracy show to produce a pilot for that purpose.\n\nStarting in 1962, Rayner began hosting his own long-running \"Ray Rayner and His Friends\", which had the title \"Breakfast With Bugs Bunny\" when he became its host; it was renamed in 1964. The show featured old cartoons such as various Warner Brothers character cartoons, arts-and-crafts, which often ended up as a gluey mess, and animals such as Chelveston the Duck who was named after RAF Chelveston where Rayner was stationed during World War II. Chelveston occasionally bit and Rayner was notably wary. During these segments, Chelveston walked around the set, eat, or bathe while a then-current top 40 song was played. Rayner later said he put duck feed in the cuffs of his coveralls so Chelveston nipped at them, then save himself from the duck by giving him a head of lettuce to pick apart. What was not known to the public until after the program was no longer on the air was that Chelveston was actually played by four different ducks over the years.\n\nRayner also had a talking dog puppet, Cuddly Dudley, created and voiced by Roy Brown, a.k.a. \"Cooky the Cook\" from \"Bozo's Circus\" and \"The Bozo Show\". The segment highlighted viewer mail which included many hand-drawn pictures submitted by children. The segment was often humorous as it was a chance for Rayner and Brown to interact and use comedic ad-libs. He always wore a jumpsuit, covered with small pieces of paper that held reminders of what to do next on the program (a cartoon, a commercial, a visit from Chelveston, etc.). He would also simulcast traffic reports from sister-station WGN Radio over stock footage of traffic moving along the Chicago-area Interstates. During baseball season, he showed and narrated highlights of the Cubs and White Sox games from the previous day, wearing a custom-sewn ball cap that had the front half of each team's cap, resulting in a two-billed cap which he spun around, depending on which team's highlights were being shown.\n\nThe arts-and-crafts was a regular segment that always began with a finished version prepared in advance by someone \"behind the scenes\" (who quite often was the wife of Producer Dick Flanders) that was displayed to the audience, followed by Rayner's attempts to demonstrate the process in an amusing, all-thumbs effort, also set to music, that resulted in a comically sub-par facsimile that more resembled a random collection of felt, construction paper and glue. Rayner's version would then be displayed alongside the original further emphasizing his comical ineptitude regarding crafts. Rayner contended that his failure at crafts made the show successful as the work of his young viewers was much better than the crafts he did on-air. He held an annual jellybean contest where viewers were to submit guesses of the quantity in a large jar displayed for a period of time on the show. Every Christmas he had an Advent calendar and reveal a date until the Christmas holiday. Another bit was a lip-synching sketch Rayner usually did to an older novelty song such as \"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\" by Allan Sherman. However he also performed serious songs while actually singing. Another feature on the show was \"Ark in the Park\", a taped segment of a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo featuring the then-director of the zoo, Dr. Lester Fisher. The introductory music for this segment was \"The Unicorn\" by The Irish Rovers. Rayner also featured a \"How and Why\" segment on his shows with J. Bruce Mitchell of Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, as did \"Garfield Goose and Friends\". Along with \"Bozo's Circus\", a video game was added to Rayner's show that viewers could play by phone called \"TV Powww\". Rayner hosted this show until his 1980 retirement from WGN.\n\nDuring his time at Channel 9, starting in 1974, Rayner also hosted a Thursday night broadcast of The Illinois State Lottery's then-weekly drawings, which featured a top prize of $300,000 (\"Weekly Bonanza\") and a second prize of $50,000 to a field of about a dozen contestants who had won a special lottery game over the preceding seven-day period. The show aired at 7:00 PM CT.\n\nDuring his years in Chicago, he also frequently appeared in live theater, including plays at the Forum Dinner Theater in suburban Summit; receiving a Jefferson award nomination for one of his roles. Rayner also did directing for student productions at Loyola University Chicago. He received an M. A. in Humanities from the University of Chicago in 1970, writing his thesis about children's television's first goal being to entertain. He was a member of the Silver Circle of the Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and received many local Emmys for his television work.\n\nRayner also wrote a book titled \"The Story of Television\" published in 1972. It is basically an industry guide to how a television show is made featuring many photos of Rayner from his \"Ray Rayner and Friends\" show. The book is quite rare and commands a high price, when available, from on-line auction sites. One copy was donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications about seven months after Rayner's passing.\n\nHe moved to KGGM-TV, the CBS affiliate in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1981, before retiring from television in 1989. He cited the harsh Chicago winters as the motivating factor. Rayner was the station's weatherman, complete with notes pinned to his jacket as they were to his coveralls in Chicago; he also hosted the local \"PM Magazine\" in Albuquerque. He returned to Chicago for the 25th and 30th anniversary shows for \"Bozo's Circus\". Rayner continued to accept some Chicago theater roles and took some time to patiently answer children's questions about his work even after moving to Albuquerque. He did a week-long stint filling in at weather and other duties at Chicago's \"Fox Thing in the Morning\" on WFLD in May 1995. Rayner took some courses at the University of New Mexico, did some teaching and wrote a column for a local newspaper there.\n\nRayner moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida after his wife, Jeanne, a former nurse, died of lung cancer in 1995. His activities there included reading to the blind, Grant A Wish (for terminally ill children), and delivering Meals on Wheels.\n\nHe died on 21 January 2004, of complications from pneumonia in Fort Myers, Florida at the age of 84.\nHe is survived by his second wife, Marie, daughter Christina Miller, his son Mark Rahner, and his grandchildren Patrick, Sean, Hilary Miller and Troy Rahner.\n\nClips from Rayner's shows are featured in the WGN Christmas special, \"\". In 2005, the Museum of Broadcast Communications awarded WGN-TV's Studio 1 a plaque to commemorate the forty years of children's television broadcast from the studio. \"Ray Rayner and Friends\" with a likeness of Rayner and Chelveston, is on the plaque along with Frazier Thomas and \"Garfield Goose and Friends\" and Bob Bell and \"Bozo's Circus\". Rayner's coveralls, complete with notes, is part of the museum's collection. Cuddly Dudley and his doghouse from \"The Bozo Show\" are also part of the museum's collection. A photo of Rayner on the set of his television show with two guests was chosen as the cover photo for \"Chicago Television\", published for the Museum of Broadcast Communications in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

Outside Mexico, Oaxaca cheese is often confused with \"asadero\" (\"queso asadero\"), a cheese produced in the northern state of Chihuahua. They are similar in texture and taste, but they are produced with different methods, making Oaxaca cheese slightly drier.\n\nIt is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made. The string cheese process (\"pasta filata\"), originally from Italy, which is used to produce mozzarella, was brought to Mexico by the Dominican friars that settled in Oaxaca. As water buffalo milk was unavailable, they used cow's milk, instead. The cheese is available in several different shapes.\n\nThe production process is complicated and involves stretching the cheese into long ribbons and rolling it up like a ball of yarn. Italian mozzarella is another cheese which is processed by stretching (the \"pasta filata\" process).\n\nQueso Oaxaca is used widely in Mexican cuisine, especially in \"quesadillas\" and \"empanadas\", where the \"queso Oaxaca\" is melted and other ingredients, such as \"huitlacoche\" and squash flowers, are added to the filling.\n\n"}

A waffle or bagel (with a large enough hole) can also be substituted for the slice of bread.\n\nVariant names for the dish include \"bullseye eggs\", \"eggs in a frame\", \"egg in a hole\", \"gashouse eggs\", \"gasthaus eggs\", \"hole in one\", \"one-eyed Jack\", \"one-eyed Pete\", \"pirate's eye\" and \"popeye\". The name \"Gashouse Special\" is used in the 1975 book \"The Kids' Kitchen Takeover\" by Sarah Stein. The name \"toad in the hole\" is sometimes used for this dish, though more commonly refers to sausages cooked in Yorkshire pudding batter.\n\nThe dish is typically bread with an egg in the center and then cooked with a little butter or oil.\n\nIt is commonly prepared by cutting a circular or square hole in the center of a piece of bread. The bread, sometimes buttered prior to cooking, is fried in a pan with butter, margarine, cooking oil, or other fat. When browned, the bread is flipped, and the egg is cracked into the \"basket\" cut into the toast. Alternatively, the egg may be dropped into the bread before the bread is browned. The time the egg is placed in the bread is dependent on desired consistency.\n\nThe dish is often either covered or flipped while cooking to obtain even cooking, and requires a degree of skill and temperature control to prevent burning either the egg or bread while the entire dish is cooked to the desired consistency.\n\nThe dish can be seen being prepared onscreen by actor Guy Kibbee in the 1935 Warner Bros film \"Mary Jane's Pa\", leading them to sometimes be known as \"Guy Kibbee eggs\". They are sometimes called \"Betty Grable eggs\", stemming from the preparation of the dish in the actress's 1941 film \"Moon Over Miami\", although the script refers to them as \"gashouse eggs\". The dish is prepared in the 1987 film \"Moonstruck\" (by Olympia Dukakis' character). It is also prepared in a 1996 episode of the sitcom \"Friends\", by the character Joey Tribbiani, who refers to it as \"eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, à la me!\" It is prepared by both Hugo Weaving and Stephen Fry's characters in the 2005 film \"V for Vendetta\", the latter referring to it as \"eggy in the basket\". It is prepared using fresh eggs by Susan Sarandon's character Marnie Minervini in the 2016 film \"The Meddler\". The dish is also portrayed in the seventh episode of season two of \"Lucifer\", where Lucifer enjoys one made with sweet bread and oyster leaves.\n"}

One of the earliest known of such Italian recipes, \"Olivarum conditurae\", appears in Columella's, \"De re Rustica\", written in the first century AD. Cato the Elder (234–149 B.C.) also includes a recipe for Epityrum, an olive spread very much like a tapenade, in chapter 119 of his, \"On Agriculture\". The use of capers is the hallmark of recipes for \"tapenade\".\n\nSometimes tapenade is confused with New Orleans olive salad, a critical component in the New Orleans sandwich the muffaletta. New Orleans olive salad is more properly called a giardiniera. It also does not contain capers, but does contain cauliflower, carrots, and celery.\n\nBase ingredients of tapenade are olives and capers. The olives (most commonly black olive) and capers are chopped finely, crushed, or blended. Then olive oil is added gradually until the mixture becomes a paste. In various regions tapenade often is flavoured differently, with other ingredients such as garlic, herbs, anchovies, lemon juice, or brandy.\n\nTapenade may be used as part of an appetizer served as a topping on crusty bread or crudités.

The other type, \"Xiǎobāo\" (小包, \"small bun\"), measure approximately 5 cm wide, and are most commonly eaten in restaurants, but may also be purchased for take-away.

It is related to other popular and similarly regional pasta dishes, like American goulash and even (more distantly) chili mac. Despite its name, it has only a very distant relation to Chinese and American Chinese cuisine.\n\nStandard American chop suey consists of elbow macaroni and bits of cooked ground beef with sautéed onions in a thick tomato-based sauce. The dish is typically cooked in a frying or sauté pan, as opposed to being baked in an oven like a casserole. Historically, salt and pepper are the only seasonings needed and no cheese is used or added. The simplicity of the dish precludes the addition of green peppers, which cannot be added without changing the flavor quite drastically from that which has been historically enjoyed in Maine. Though this comfort food is influenced by Italian-American cuisine as well as older New England quick and practical meals like the \"potato bargain\" and \"necessity mess,\" it is known as \"American chop suey\" both because it is a sometimes-haphazard hodgepodge of meat, vegetables and Italian seasonings, and because it once used rice, a base ingredient in Chinese cuisine, instead of pasta.\n\nThe recipe is quite adaptable to taste and available ingredients. Elbow macaroni is the standard but can be substituted with pasta of similar size, such as ziti, farfalle, or rotelle. If the onions are omitted, or green peppers, mushrooms added, etc. a delicious meal can be created, but will not be the \"classic\" New England dish.

Mainly, it is found in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Egypt (\"kubbeh\", \"kebbah\", or \"koubeiba\"), Iraq, as well as Armenia (\"Keufteh\", \"ltsonvats\" ), Iran, Israel, Cyprus (\"koupa\", plural \"koupes\") and in Turkey it is called \"içli köfte\".\n\nIt is also found throughout Latin American countries which received substantial numbers of Levantine immigrants during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the region, the dish is particularly popular in the Yucatan peninsula and the Caribbean coastline of Colombia and in Brazil.\n\nThe word is derived from the Classical Arabic \"kubbah\" (\"kibbeh\" in North Levantine Arabic), which means \"ball\". Various transliterations of the name are used in different countries: in English, \"kibbe\" and \"kibbeh\" and in Latin America, \"quibe\", quibbe, \"kibe\", or \"quipe\" (Argentina).\n\nIn Levantine cuisine, a variety of dishes made with bulghur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called \"kibbeh\". The northern Syrian city of Aleppo (Halab) is famous for having more than 17 different types. These include \"kibbeh\" prepared with sumac (\"kibbe sumāqiyye\"), yogurt (\"kibbe labaniyye\"), quince (\"kibbe safarjaliyye\"), lemon juice (\"kibbe ḥāmḍa\"), pomegranate sauce, cherry sauce, and other varieties, such as the \"disk\" \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbe arāṣ\"), the \"plate\" \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbe biṣfīḥa\" or \"kibbe bṣēniyye\") and the raw \"kibbeh\" (\"kibbeh nayyeh\").\n\n\"Kibbeh nayyeh\" is a raw dish made from a mixture of bulghur, very finely minced lamb or beef similar to steak tartare, and Middle Eastern spices, served on a platter, frequently as part of a \"meze\" in Lebanon and Syria, garnished with mint leaves and olive oil, and served with green onions or scallions, green hot peppers, and pita/pocket bread or \"markouk\" bread.\n\n\"Kubba Halab\" is an Iraqi version of kibbeh created with a rice crust and named after the largest city in Syria, Aleppo. \"Kubba Mosul\", also Iraqi, is flat and round like a disc. \"Kubbat Shorba\" is an Iraqi-Kurdish version prepared as a stew, commonly made with tomato sauce and spices. It is often served with \"arak\" and various salads. The Iraqi versions are part of the same versions eaten in Iran.\n\nA Syrian soup known as \"kubbi kishk\" consists of \"kubbi\" \"torpedoes\" or \"footballs\" in a yogurt (\"kishk\") and butter broth with stewed cabbage leaves. Another soup, known as \"kibbeh hamda\", consists of a chicken stock with vegetables (usually leeks, celery, turnips and courgettes), lemon juice and garlic, with small \"kibbeh\" made with ground rice as dumplings. In the Syrian Jewish diaspora this is popular both at Pesach and as the pre-fast meal on the day before Yom Kippur.\n\nOn Colombia's Caribbean coast, the most local variations of the dish use ground beef instead of lamb, but the original recipe, or one with mixture of beef and lamb, can be found served by the large Middle Eastern population of the zone. The dish has acquired almost vernacular presence and is frequently served in social occasions at both Arab and non-Arab households. When served as an adopted local dish, it is offered often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including Empanadas, Tequeños and Carimañolas.\n\n"}

It was invented as a vegetarian food, and it consists of fried onions, lentils, rice, macaroni and lemon sauce. It's somehow related to italian cuisine and to an indian dish made only from rice and lentils, \"khichdi\", but the egyptian dish has more ingredients and flavors, especially the local Egyptian sauce giving it its unique taste the dish is popular with.

Over time, the dish has evolved through Egyptian soldiers, then Egyptian citizens. \"Kushari \"used to be sold on food carts in its early years, and was introduced to restaurants later.\n\nThis dish is widely popular among workers and laborers. It may be prepared at home, and is also served at roadside stalls and restaurants all over Egypt; some restaurants specialize in \"kushari\" to the exclusion of other dishes, while others feature it as one item among many.

Additions can include salsa, refried beans, sour cream, onion, rice, or jalapeños. There are many variations and alternative names used by region. Frito pie can be prepared in a casserole dish, but an alternate preparation can be in a single-serve Fritos-type corn chip bag with various ingredients as toppings. In Mexico, a similar type of dish is chilaquiles.\n\nThe exact origin of the frito pie is not completely clear. It is believed that it was created somewhere in Mexico and was popular at fiestas before it took off in other countries like the United States.\n\nThe oldest known recipe using Fritos brand corn chips with chili was published in Texas in 1949. The recipe may have been invented by Daisy Doolin, the founder's mother and the first person to use Fritos as an ingredient in cooking, or Mary Livingston, his executive secretary. The Frito-Lay company attributes the recipe to Nell Morris, who joined Frito-Lay in the 1950s and helped develop an official cookbook which included the Frito pie.\n\nDoolin and his Frito Corporation were early investors in Disneyland, which opened Casa de Fritos restaurant in Disneyland in 1955. \"Frito Chili Pie\" appears on the 1950s menu. \nAnother story claims that true Frito pie originated only in the 1960s with Teresa Hernández, who worked at the F. W. Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her Frito pie used homemade red chili con carne with cheddar cheese and onions, and was served in the bag – which was thicker in the 1960s.\n\nFrito pie is a simple dish: At its most basic, it is just a pile of Fritos with beef chili poured on top. It is often served right inside the chip bag, which is split down the middle; toppings typically include shredded cheese and chopped raw onion, and may also include additional items like sour cream and jalapeños.\n\nFrito Pies are sometimes referred to by the name walking taco or Frito boat, and can be made in a small, single-serving bag of corn chips, with chili, taco meat, garbanzos, pork rinds, pepitas, and many other varied ingredients, poured over the top. The combination can be finished with grated cheese, onions, jalapeños, lettuce, and sour cream, known as a Frito boat or walking taco in the Midwestern United States. In the Ohio Valley region, this preparation is commonly called taco-in-a-bag. (\"Walking taco\" or \"Traveling taco\", however, is the more widespread term at least in the Midwest). In many parts of Southern California, they are known as \"pepper bellies\". Frito pies are popular at sports venues, fundraisers, bingos, open houses, state fairs and street vendors. The term Tostiloco comes from Tijuana, and is found in California. Another term is Doriloco, after Doritos.\n\nIn Mexico, a version of the dish is known as tostilocos. It includes some different ingredients.\n\n\n"}

Flours made from other sources such as lentils, chickpeas, rice, tapioca, or potato can be used.\n\n\"Papadum\" is typically served as an accompaniment to a meal in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka or as an appetizer or snack, sometimes with toppings such as chopped onions, chopped carrots, chutneys or other dips, and condiments. In Pakistan, these are made of rice and often used as a snack or meal accompaniment. In certain parts of India, \"poppadoms\" which have been dried, but not cooked, are used in curries and vegetable dishes. \"Papadums\" has been a part of the Indian subcontinent for generations and is an intrisic part of everyday meals.\n\n\"Papadums\" are called \"appalam\" in Tamil Nadu, \"pappadam\" in Kerala, \"appadam\" in Andhra/Telangana, \"happala\" in Karnataka, and \"papad\" in Gujarat. They are mainly made in Rajasthan, Maharastra, and Gujarat in the north. In the south, Kerala, Madurai district in Tamil Nadu, Kanchipuram, and Chennai are major manufacturers.\n\n\"Papadum\" is derived from the Sanskrit word \"parpaṭa\" (पर्पट).\n\n\"Papadum\" recipes vary from region to region and from family to family. They are typically made from flour or paste derived from either lentils, chickpeas, black gram, rice, or potato.\n\nSalt and peanut oil are added to make a dough, which can be flavored with seasonings such as chili, cumin, garlic, or black pepper. Sometimes, baking soda or slaked lime is also added. The dough is shaped into a thin, round flatbread and then dried (traditionally in the sun), and can be cooked by deep frying, roasting over an open flame, toasting, or microwaving, depending on the desired texture.\n\nBikaner is the hub of chickpea and green gram \"papadam\" manufacturing. Potato \"papadam\" is made in Varanasi. Most sweet- and snack-selling national companies are also involved in this business.\n\nIn most Indian restaurants around the world, they are served as an appetizer with dips, which often include mango chutney, lime pickle, onion chutney, and \"raita\".\n\n\"Papadum\" can be prepared from different ingredients and methods. Arguably, the most popular recipe uses flour ground from hulled split black gram mixed with black pepper, salt, and a small amount of vegetable oil and a food-grade alkali, and the mixture is kneaded. A well-kneaded dough is then flattened into very thin rounds and then dried and stored for later preparation and consumption. It may also contain rice, Jackfruit, Sabudana, etc., as main ingredients. Cracked black pepper, red chili powder, Asafoetida, or cumin or sesame seeds are often used as flavoring agents.\n\n\"Papadum\" is often associated with the empowerment of women in India. Many individual and organized businesses run by women produce papad, pickles, and other snacks. This provides them regular income from minimal financial investments. Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad is an organization (owned and run solely by women) which produces large quantities of \"papadums\" on the open market, which started as a small business in the late 1950s, with an annual income in 2005 of about . However, with the recent growth of modern trade in India and the growing consumer awareness, other brands have been gaining in popularity within this category.\n\n"}

Today, roman and italic type are mixed, and most typefaces are composed of an upright roman style with an associated italic or oblique style.\n\nEarly roman typefaces show a variety of designs, for instance characters resembling what would now be considered blackletter. Printers and typefounders such as Nicolas Jenson and Aldus Manutius in Venice and later Robert Estienne in France codified the modern characteristics of Roman type, for instance an 'h' with a nearly straight right leg, serifs on the outside of the capital 'M' and 'N', and 'e' with level cross stroke, by the 1530s.\n\nPopular roman typefaces include Bembo, Baskerville, Caslon, Jenson, Times New Roman and Garamond.\n\nThe name \"roman\" is customarily applied uncapitalized distinguishing early Italian typefaces of the Renaissance period and most subsequent upright types based on them, in contrast to \"Roman\" letters dating from classical antiquity.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1929217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929217", "title": "Fruitopia", "text": "Fruitopia\n\nFruitopia is a fruit-flavored drink introduced by The Coca-Cola Company in 1994 and targeted at teens and young adults. According to \"New York Times\" business reports, it was invented as part of a push by Coca-Cola to capitalize on the success of Snapple and other flavored tea drinks. The brand gained substantial hype in the mid-1990s before enduring lagging sales by decade's end. While still available in Canada and in Australia as a juice brand, in 2003, Fruitopia was phased out in most of the United States where it had struggled for several years. However, select flavors have since been revamped under Coca-Cola's successful Minute Maid brand. Use of the Fruitopia brand name continues through various beverages in numerous countries, including some McDonald's restaurant locations in the United States, which carry the drink to this day.\n\nFruitopia was a pet project of Coke's former marketing chief, Sergio Zyman. The company spent an initial marketing budget of $30 million, allowing Fruitopia to quickly gain hype in the mid-1990s. \"TIME magazine\" named Fruitopia one of the Top 10 New Products of 1994, and the beverage would even be mentioned on the popular animated series, \"The Simpsons\".\n\nThe brand's flagship flavor would be Strawberry Passion Awareness. This flavor was available at drink fountains as well at McDonald's as Coca-Cola pushed this drink to market in many places. Fruitopia vending machines have also appeared in schools and college campuses in addition to, or as a replacement of, soda.\n\nIn addition to the popular Strawberry Passion Awareness, other flavors included The Grape Beyond, Tangerine Wavelength, Citrus Consciousness, Fruit Integration, Pink Lemonade Euphoria, Lemonade Love & Hope, Raspberry Psychic Lemonade, Strawberry Kiwi Ruckus, and Beachside Blast. These flavors were available in the United States while a much wider array was available in the UK. On March 23, 1995, a Fruitopia fruit tea line featuring Born Raspberry, Peaceable Peach, Lemon Berry Intuition, and Curious Mango was introduced in 16-ounce glass bottles. In a drive to remake the brand and remarket it as more relevant to Generation X, however, Coca-Cola dropped several Fruitopia flavors in 1996, added others (such as Beachside Blast and Banana Vanilla Inclination), and renamed others (Citrus Consciousness becoming Citrus Excursion).\n\nFruitopia had rather unusual commercials despite the simplicity of the product behind them. They featured animation using imagery of fruit arrayed in colorful, spinning kaleidoscope patterns. This was accompanied by idealistic aphorisms reminiscent of hippie poetry of the 1960s, such as might be found in advertisements which ran in underground press newspapers of the period. Background music on several of the ads was provided by The Muffs, Kate Bush, and the Cocteau Twins. Ad copy ran as follows:\n\n\"There is a beautiful person<br>\n\"living inside you!<br>\n\"Please share a Raspberry Psychic Lemonade<br>\n\"with him or her.\"\n\nIts recurring slogan was \"Fruitopia: for the mind, body, and planet.\" \n\nIn 1997, Greek writer Eugene Trivizas won the first stage of a legal battle against Coca-Cola. This prevented the multinational company from registering \"Fruitopia\" as a trademark for soft drinks, as it was already trademarked for the title of his TV serial and comic-strip books. The court decided that Coca-Cola had unlawfully appropriated his intellectual property. Coca-Cola appealed against the decision and, in December 1999, the relevant court of appeal ruled once again in his favour prohibiting the use of his intellectual property as a trademark for soft drinks.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Fruitopia had struggled to maintain a profitable profile. In 2003, the Fruitopia line was all but discontinued in the United States, with some flavors being revamped under the Minute Maid moniker; Minute Maid, the world's largest juice brand, was largely responsible for the lagging sales of Fruitopia. A similar situation occurred with PepsiCo, who replaced their own Fruitopia clone, Fruit Works, with the enduring Tropicana moniker. Fruitopia Strawberry Passion Awareness is still available in the United States (branded as Minute Maid) in McDonald's fountain machines nationwide.\n\nDue to its success in the region, Fruitopia juice is still available in Canada in a wide variety of flavours and continues to be sold in Australia as a juice brand. The ingredients in Canadian and former American Fruitopia drinks are not the same and taste(d) different; notably, the United States version has preservatives added. In 2007, Coca-Cola GmbH Germany released a new fruit juice line under the name \"Fruitopia by Minute Maid\", essentially an alternately named Minute Maid.\n\nIn 2001, Fruitopia was relaunched in Australia as a juice brand but was unable to gain major success. Four years later, it held only 4% of the Australian juice market, prompting Coca-Cola Australia’s then general manager for Non Carbs, John McLoughlin, to invest several million dollars into revitalizing the brand in what was seen as a challenge to the reigning Berri brand. This was based on research suggesting that while consumers did not hold the product experience in high esteem, they chose Fruitopia as their favorite brand name. The plan involved the launch Fruitopia J, an ambient juice, and as Fruitopia Classic, a chilled juice as well as $100 million in dedicated Fruitopia coolers. Critics did not agree with the strategy, and within two years, Fruitopia maintained only a weak market share.\n\nA drink to dilute with the same name is being sold by the Coca-Cola Company in Argentina, under their Cepita branch.\n\n\n"}

The texture of this sweet is similar to fudge.\n\nMysore pak was first prepared in the kitchens of the Mysore Palace during the regime of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, by a palace cook named Kakasura Madappa. Madappa made a concoction of gram flour, ghee and sugar. When asked its name, Madappa had nothing in mind, simply called it the 'Mysuru paka'. Pak (or paka, more precisely) in Kannada means sweet.

In spite of the name \"Swiss roll\", the cake is believed to have originated elsewhere in Central Europe, likely Austria. It appears to have been invented in the nineteenth century, along with Battenberg, doughnuts, and Victoria sponge.\n\nThe spiral layered shape of the Swiss roll has inspired usage as a descriptive term in other fields, such as in optics and many forms of the term \"jelly roll\".\n\nThe earliest published reference for a rolled cake spread with jelly was in the \"Northern Farmer\", a journal published in Utica, New York, in December 1852. Called “To Make Jelly Cake”, the recipe describes a modern \"jelly roll\" and reads: “Bake quick and while hot spread with jelly. Roll carefully, and wrap it in a cloth. When cold cut in slices for the table.”\n\nThe terminology evolved in America for many years. From 1852 to 1877 such a dessert was called: Jelly Cake (1852), Roll Jelly Cake (1860), Swiss Roll (1872), Jelly Roll (1873), and Rolled Jelly Cake (1876). The name “Jelly Roll” was eventually adopted.\n\nThe origin of the term \"Swiss roll\" is unknown. The earliest British reference to a rolled cake by that name appeared on a bill of fare dated 18 June 1871, published in the 1872 book \"A Voyage from Southampton to Cape Town, in the Union Company’s Mail Steamer “Syria”\" (London). A recipe for \"Swiss roll\" also appeared in the US that same year in \"The American Home Cook Book\", published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1872.\n\nSeveral 1880s to 1890s cookbooks from London, England, used the name Swiss roll exclusively.\n\nThe \"American Pastry Cook\", published in Chicago in 1894, presented a basic \"Jelly Roll Mixture\" then listed variants made from it that included a Swiss roll, Venice roll, Paris roll, chocolate roll, jelly roll cotelettes, and decorated jelly rolls.\n\nIn the Czech Republic the Swiss roll is called \"piškotová roláda\".\n\nThe origin of this cake is likely the UK, since Hong Kong was an integral British territory from the 19th century to 1997. The cake is never pre-packaged, as it is sold fresh daily in the Chinese bakeries. Overall, this cake has been sold next to other Chinese pastries well before the popularising of Western-style bakeries such as Maxim. There are several popular variations.\n\nMost US Chinatown bakeries sell the basic Hong Kong Swiss roll version. It essentially looks and tastes identical to the one sold in Hong Kong. A popular flavour in Chinese bakeries in the US is the tiger roll, which has a coffee-flavoured golden-esque striped outer appearance, and is chocolate-coloured or light-coloured, with traditional white cream inside. It is similar to the look of a tiger bread.\n\nIn India, Swiss rolls are called \"jam rolls\".\n\nIn Indonesia, the Swiss roll cake is called \"bolu gulung\". Most bakeries sell Swiss rolls daily, and they are filled with butter cream, cheese or fruit jam. It is also very common for Swiss rolls to be sold by the slice, but some shops sell by both slice and roll.\n\nIn the area from Sicily to Caltanissetta (Italy), there is a food made with \"sponge ciccolato\", ricotta cheese, and marzipan called the \"rollò\".\n\nIn Japan, Swiss rolls are called \"roll cake\". They are filled with whipped cream and sometimes with fruits like strawberries.\n\nIn Colombia, a Swiss roll is called either \"pionono\" or \"brazo de reina\" (\"queen's arm\"), and it is filled with \"dulce de guayaba\" (guava jam) or arequipe. In Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru, it is also called \"pionono\", and it is filled with \"dulce de leche manjar blanco\" (\"sweet milk white delicacy\"). In Chile it is called \"brazo de reina\", filled with \"dulce de leche\" only, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. \n\nIn Puerto Rico and Venezuela it is known as \"brazo de gitano\", but there is a vast array of fillings that include cream, chocolate truffle, \"dulce de guayaba\", \"dulce de leche manjar blanco\", often combined with fruits. In Brazil, it is called \"rocambole\". In Mexico it is called \"nino envuelto\" (\"wrapped child\"). In Ecuador it is known as a \"brazo gitano\" (\"gypsy's arm\"). \n\nVarieties produced in Malaysia include kaya, pandan, blueberry, strawberry, sweet potato, taro, vanilla, orange, chocolate, raspberry, and even local fruits like durian, cempedak, and mango.\n\nIn the Philippines, it is called \"pianono\", and has been adapted into several variations which use native flavors, such as \"ube\" and \"macapuno\". \"Pianono\" has a different texture and is usually sold in prolific neighborhood bakeries such as a Sari-Sari Store. Due to American influence, it is called a \"cake roll\" in high-end bakeries and bakeshops. A similar roll is the \"Brazo de Mercedes\" (\"Mercy's arm\"), composed of a soft meringue body and a custard core. A variant of ube cake can also be baked into a Swiss roll.\n\nIn Portugal, desserts called \"tortas\" are commonly found on restaurant menus. Such desserts are not tarts, nor are they similar to German \"torte\". They are simply Swiss rolls with jam filling.\n\nIn Denmark, Norway, and Sweden the Swiss roll is called \"roulade\", \"rullade\", or \"rulltårta\". An alternative Norwegian name is \"rullekake\".\n\nIn Sweden and Finland, the Swiss roll is called \"rulltårta\", respectively \"kääretorttu\" (both meaning \"roll-cake\"), and it is commonly served with coffee. The filling often consists of butter cream and strawberry jam. The base of a chocolate version, called \"drömrulltårta\" (\"dream roll-cake\"), is made mostly of potato flour, instead of the typical wheat flour, and it is filled with butter cream. More elaborate versions of the Swiss roll can be found in bakeries, with, for example, whipped cream and a crushed banana rolled in the middle, or with a thin marzipan coating that resembles a birch log.\n\nIn Spain, the dessert is called \"brazo de gitano\" (literally translated as \"gypsy's arm\") and is commonly filled with cream or chocolate truffle.\n\nDespite its name, the Swiss roll did not originate in Switzerland. Swiss rolls are called \"Biskuitroulade\" or \"Roulade\" in Swiss Standard German, \"gâteau roulé\" or \"roulade\" in French, and \"biscotto arrotolato\" in Italian.\n\nIn the UK, Swiss rolls are popular at teatime or as a dessert. A variety of Swiss rolls are available on sale in supermarkets in the United Kingdom, such as chocolate Swiss rolls, lemon Swiss rolls or jam Swiss rolls; these all have different colours. Jam Swiss rolls will be filled with jam and also possibly cream, with a sugar outer coating. Chocolate Swiss rolls are made in Great Britain in a similar way to the United States version. Jam roly-poly is a similar dessert, but made as a suet pudding rather than a cake, filled with jam and served hot with custard.\n\nAmerican pastry chefs and menus in fine dining restaurants often use the French term \"roulade\". The chocolate Swiss roll, sometimes called a \"chocolate log\", is a popular snack. Produced by many commercial bakeries, common brands include Ho Hos and Yodels, which are smaller-sized rolls for individual consumption.

It is many cell layers thick and capable of absorbing atmospheric moisture and nutrients, but its main function may lie in protecting the underlying cells against damaging UV rays (Chomicki et al., 2015).\n\nOften, the roots of orchids are associated with symbiotic fungi or bacteria; the latter may fix nutrients from the air. This functionality allows the orchid to exist in locations that provide a reproductive or vegetative advantage such as improved exposure or reduced competition from other plant species.\n\nThe velamen also serves a mechanical function, protecting the vascular tissues in the root cortex, shielding the root from transpirational water loss, and, in many cases, adhering the plant to the substrate.\n\nThe typical orchid root has a stele of comparatively small diameter. It is surrounded by a cortex which is further enveloped by a highly specialized exodermis, most of which at maturity do not contain protoplasm. A few cells, however, are living and allow the passage of water through them. The exodermis is surrounded by velamen, consisting of one to several layers of cells, which can develop root hair under proper environmental conditions.\n\nThe velamen arises from the root tip by division of a special tissue. The dead cells of velamen diffuse light, thus giving it a grey appearance—except at the tips, where the chlorophyll become visible. Upon absorbing water, the dead cells become transparent, and the whole velamen tissue then appears green.\n\n"}

It is found as an attribute of evil spirits in the Qur'an (aṣ-Ṣāffāt, 37:7), which speaks of a \"safeguard against every rebellious devil\" (شَيْطَانٍ مَارِدٍ, \"shaitān mārid\").\n\nThe Wehr-Cowan dictionary of modern written Arabic also gives secondary meanings of \"demon\" and \"giant\". Lane's \"Arabic-English Lexicon\" cites a source where it \"\"is said to be applied to an evil jinnee of the most powerful class\"\", but this distinction is not universal. For example, in the standard MacNaghten edition of \"One Thousand and One Nights\" one finds the words \"marid\" and \"ifrit\" used interchangeably (e.g., in \"The Story of the Fisherman\").\n\nA mārid is explicitly mentioned in Sirat Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan. Accordingly, Sayf demands from the marid to lead him to Solomon's hoard. But following his nature, the demon does the exact opposite of that he was commanded. Later he learned from Khidr, he must command the opposite of that he desires him to do.\n\nIn Jonathan Stroud's \"Bartimaeus Sequence\" novel series, marids are the most powerful type of demons summoned by magicians.\n\nIn the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" tabletop game, marids are genies from the Elemental Plane of Water.\n\n"}

Traditionally, its preparation and consumption was an important economizing custom, especially for the rural poor. Particularly, it allowed farmers to use various less-desirable parts of pork, which were made more palatable by being added to a seasoned porridge of groats or flour. The closely related 'Panhas', 'Pannas' or 'Möppkenbrot' are widely known in the whole northwest of Germany; the last variety is a speciality of middle Westphalia.\n\nOriginally, balkenbrij was prepared upon farms at the end of the pig-slaughtering process, in the pot used to cook the swill. It was eaten soon because of its poor shelf life. \n\nIt is traditionally made of stock left over from the making of sausages like liverwurst, boiled with flour (and sometimes blood, which turns the color from white to black) and bacon, together with odd scraps and various organ meats of the animal such as liver, kidney and/or lungs. All of these are cooked, ground, then cooked again with flour (either wheat or buckwheat) or oatmeal, and a special spice mix (\"\") consisting of liquorice, sugar, anise, cinnamon, clove, white pepper, mace, ginger powder and sandalwood, and finally poured into a pan or mold and cooled off to achieve the form of a loaf. The loaf of balkenbrij is then sliced (about 1 cm thick), and the slices are dusted with flour and fried, traditionally in lard.\n\nToday, products for the broad consumer market are specially made of a planned portion of the slaughtered swine (blood, fat, minor muscle meat and sometimes organ meats such as liver or stomach). A staple ingredient in most German versions is pearl barley.\n\nThere are as many recipes as there are Dutch regions, and especially well known is the variety from Gelderland with raisins. Balkenbrij is technically a relative of scrapple and a distant relative of black pudding and Scottish Haggis.\n\nBalkenbrij was one of the classic foods brought by Dutch settlers to the New World. An example of a recipe is given in a 1936 cookbook from Holland, Michigan.\n"}
{"id": "1940276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940276", "title": "Heinz pickle pin", "text": "Heinz pickle pin\n\nThe Heinz pickle pin is an advertising item from the H. J. Heinz Company, being a small green pin made in the shape of a pickle. Being continuously offered for more than a century, and with more than 100 million pins produced over the years, it is both one of the longest-running and most successful promotions in history.\n\nThe Heinz pickle pin is very small, about inches long , dark green, and fully \"three-dimensional\". The word HEINZ appears across the pickle in raised lettering. Because its \"retro\" design and long tradition are part of the appeal of the pickle pin, the design has changed relatively little in over a century of production. The few changes made have been relatively minor. The original pins were made from gutta-percha, a resin material which was a predecessor to modern plastics, and widely used in the 1800s for dental fillings, jewelry, and insulation for wiring. More recent pins use modern plastic. The pinback has changed from a simple wire which clasps around itself to a modern safety-pin back. The earliest pins had a wire pendant-like hook, allowing them to be hung from a string. Finally, the color has varied somewhat, from a realistic light green matte to the darker and shinier cucumber green used today\n\nThe pickle pin was envisioned by Heinz company founder H. J. Heinz, and predates even the \"57 varieties\" slogan for which Heinz is famous. The first Heinz pickle pins were given away at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's Columbian Exposition, where a simple and inexpensive gift was thought to be necessary to draw visitors toward Heinz's relatively out-of-the-way booth in the upper gallery of the Agricultural Building. Heinz believed that the public could help advertise the Heinz brand by wearing a branded item: \"We keep our shingle out and then let the public blow our horn, and that counts.\" Today, when clothing bearing corporate logos is a common sight, this might seem obvious. At the time, however, it represented a new and different marketing concept. Heinz had some local boys scatter thousands of small white tokens around the fairground, with text offering the \"finder\" a free souvenir if they came to the Heinz booth. Their reward for stopping by was the opportunity to sample some food, and a complimentary promotional pickle pin. Heinz would distribute one million pickle pins by the fair's end, making the promotion an incredible success.\n\nThough undoubtedly a success, the actual impact of the pickle promotion on Heinz's business may have been slightly exaggerated. Literature at the time suggested that the pin saved Heinz from certain financial doom. A contemporary ad read spoke of Mr. Heinz: \"A man who found himself in a pickle... was saved by one.\" Whether this is literally true is speculative, but the Heinz company has stuck with this line, even including the preceding quote in a 1999 press release. The success of the pickle pin promotion has achieved almost legendary status, including a story that several of the first-floor fair exhibitors sued Heinz for unfair competition, while the second floor vendors, swamped with guests because of the traffic Heinz drew, threw a gala dinner in his honor.\n\nAfter the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, Heinz continued distributing its pickle pins at events and by other means. Atlantic City's Iron Pier, opened in 1896, would in 1898 be purchased by Heinz and renamed Heinz Pier. The pier was a popular tourist attraction, featuring a museum, food samples, and free pickle pins. Heinz gave out pickle pins on the pier for nearly half a century and still do to this day at the nearby Atlantic City Historical Museum. Another venue where the Heinz pickle pins famously appeared was the 1939 New York World's Fair, where Heinz had an enormous exhibit building called the Heinz Dome. In 1982, at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, Heinz once again gave out free pickle pins, but this time with a twist: the pins were distributed by a huge motorized ketchup bottle which moved freely around the fairgrounds. Visitors to Pittsburgh could acquire a pickle pin by taking the Heinz factory tour. Today, Heinz distributes the pins mostly one-by-one, by mail, for free to people who write in to their corporate address to request one. According to Heinz, they distribute just under a million pickle pins a year.\n\nFor the year 2000, the Heinz company decided to try something new for its pickle pin. For the first time, an entirely different pin was produced. Rather than a pickle, the new pin was shaped like a red Heinz ketchup bottle, complete with painted white cap and keystone-shaped label. The first batch of ketchup pins made also feature a printed \"2000\" to denote its commemorative status. A total of one million ketchup pins were produced, which is roughly the equivalent of a year's worth of pickle pins.\n\nBesides the year 2000 ketchup pin, several similar items to the Heinz pickle pin have appeared over the years. A golden lapel pin in the shape of a pickle is a recent example, and Heinz has also made a pickle whistle, presumably as a fun item for kids too young to wear a pin (similar to the Oscar Mayer hot dog whistles distributed from the Wienermobile). In recent years, the amount of Heinz merchandise available has become so large that Heinz actually operates its own retail store called the House of Heinz, located in Grove City, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}
{"id": "1940733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940733", "title": "Clerical collar", "text": "Clerical collar\n\nA clerical collar, clergy collar, or Roman collar, is an item of Christian clerical clothing. The collar closes at the back of the neck, presenting a seamless front. The shirt may have the collar built in. The clerical tab is almost always white and was originally made of cotton or linen but is now frequently made of plastic. Sometimes it is attached with a \"collaret\" or \"collarino\" that covers the white collar almost completely, except for a small white square at the base of the throat, and sometimes with the top edge of the collar exposed to mimic the collar of a cassock. It may simply be a detachable tab of white in the front of the clerical shirt. The clerical shirt is traditionally black (or another color appropriate to a person's ministry rank, such as purple for Anglican bishops), but today is available in a variety of colors depending on the wearer's preference. Once the clerical collar is removed the garment is indistinguishable from any other shirt. When clergy are delivering sermons, they sometimes attach preaching bands to their clerical collar.\n\nAccording to the Church of England's Enquiry Centre (citing the \"Glasgow Herald\" of December 6, 1894), the detachable clerical collar was invented in 1865 by the Rev. Donald Mcleod, a Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) minister in Glasgow.\n\nBy 1840, Anglican clergy developed a sense of separation between themselves and the secular world. One outward symbol of this was the adoption of distinctive clerical dress. This had started with the black coat and white necktie which had been worn for some decades. By the 1880s this had been transmuted into the clerical collar, which was worn almost constantly by the majority of clergy for the rest of the period.\n\nHenry McCloud stated that the collar \"was nothing else than the shirt collar turned down over the cleric's everyday common dress in compliance with a fashion that began toward the end of the sixteenth century. For when the laity began to turn down their collars, the clergy also took up the mode.\" Invented in the Presbyterian Church, the clerical collar was adopted by other Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Anglican Church, Methodist churches, Eastern Orthodox Church, Baptist churches and the Lutheran churches. Prior to the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) the practice of Catholic clergy wearing the clerical collar as street-dress tended to be found only in those countries where Catholicism was the minority religion. It was mandatory for U.S. Catholic priests starting in 1884. In the 1960s, many clergy who lived in countries where Catholicism was the dominant religion also began to wear the clerical collar rather than the soutane or cassock.\n\nIn the Reformed tradition, which stresses preaching as a central concern, pastors often don preaching tabs, which project from their clerical collar. Preaching bands (an alternative name for tabs) are also worn by Anglican clergy, particularly on occasions such as inductions when choir dress of cassock, surplice, preaching scarf and the academic hood pertaining to degree is worn, as well as at Mattins and Evensong. Methodist and Lutheran clergy also sometimes attach preaching bands to their clerical collars.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the clerical collar is worn by all ranks of clergy, thus: bishops, priests, and deacons, and often by seminarians who have been admitted to candidacy for the priesthood as well as with their cassock during liturgical celebrations.\n\nAmong the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church a band collarette with no \"notch\" in front may be worn by seminarians, although the norm is still a standard clerical collar. However, as the cassock is more commonly, if not mandatorily, worn to classes, often a plain white shirt will suffice, or a band collar with no collarette. Slavic cassocks button to the side, and thus a collar is often pointless, whereas a Greek cassock buttons to the front and has a higher collar, so the collar prevents chafing—as was its original function under a cassock. Eastern deacons and sometimes subdeacons, but rarely readers or other minor clerics, also wear a clerical collar, with subdeacons and readers often having a style with no notch, or a tab shirt with no tab. Most Orthodox clerics do not wear a clerical collar; those who do are usually to be found in Western Europe or North America.\n\nCollars are typically worn by clergy of other groups such as those of the Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian and Lutheran traditions, although many Scandinavian Lutheran clergy wear the ruff instead. Also many Pentecostal and non-denominational Protestants, and others wear collars. In the Roman Catholic tradition, major seminarians, after receiving admission to candidacy (and thus becoming \"candidates\" for ordination), often wear clericals in the seminary or their dioceses.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (and other British-influenced countries, such as Canada), clerical collars have been informally referred to as \"dog collars\" since the mid-nineteenth century. The term \"Roman collar\" is equivalent to \"clerical collar\" and does not necessarily mean that the wearer is Roman Catholic.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, non-Christian clergy, such as some Jewish rabbis in England (such as Rabbi Abraham Cohen, the editor of the Soncino Books of the Bible) would also wear clerical collars. \n\nDuring the 1950s the Reverend Alec Vidler began to advocate the abolition of the clerical collar in favour of a black shirt and white tie, but whilst some clergy adopted this mode of dress it did not become widespread. \n\nMembers of religious orders will often wear a \"Brother's Collar\" or \"Brothers Collarette\" which is very similar to a typical clerical collar, but revealing a noticeably smaller amount of the white band.\n\nSome Unitarian Universalist ministers choose to wear a clerical collar along with a stole.\n"}

Some of the meats may be roasted before being diced together with other cuts of meat and braised in lard or vegetable oil.\nThe sauerkraut is often rinsed and drained before being chopped and mixed with shredded fresh cabbage. The proportion depends on the sauerkraut's maturity – the longer it has cured, the more sour it tastes, calling for more fresh cabbage to balance the flavor. Traditionally, cabbage was pickled in fall, so \" made at that time could be made with only half-cured sauerkraut, but by early spring, the sauerkraut had to be combined in equal parts with fresh cabbage. The mixture is precooked in a small amount of water before being mixed with the braised meat and left to simmer for several hours. Ideally, the stew should thicken through evaporation alone, but flour, roux, crumbled rye bread or a grated raw potato may be added to it to take up excess moisture.\n\nOther ingredients often added to ' include onions, diced and browned in lard together with the meat, and dried forest mushrooms that are precooked separately in boiling water. The stew is usually seasoned with salt, black peppercorns, allspice, juniper berries and bay leaves. Some recipes also call for caraway, cloves, garlic, marjoram, mustard seeds, nutmeg, paprika and thyme. The tart flavor of sauerkraut may be enhanced by adding some dry red wine or beet sour (fermented beetroot juice that is also a traditional ingredient of borscht), which may impart a reddish hue to the stew.

It is usually seasoned with juniper berries, which help neutralize off-flavors that may be found in the meat of wild animals.\n\nAs a dish that does not spoil quickly and only gets tastier with each reheating, ' has been traditionally used as a provision for travellers and campers or consumed at outdoor events, such as a hunt or a carnival sleigh ride known in Polish as '.

Varieties of flavored vodka that match well with ' include ' (bison grass), ' (juniper), ' (wormwood), ' (various herbs) and \" (oak-aged). If served at home or in a restaurant, the stew may be washed down with beer, red wine or Riesling.\n\nAccording to Polish food historian Maria Dembińska, ' may derive from a medieval dish known in Latin as ', or \"mixture\". It was made from various vegetables, such as cabbage, chard and onions, that were chopped or shredded, layered inside an earthenware three-legged Dutch oven and braised or baked. A remnant of this old procedure may be found in a ' recipe, in which bacon and cabbage are arranged in layers, from the 19th-century Russian cookbook, \"A Gift to Young Housewives\" by Elena Molokhovets. Similar, layered dishes of medieval origin exist in other European cuisines; they include the Italian ' (known in 16th-century Poland under the Polonized name, ') and the Alsatian ' (also known as '), made from cabbage, leftover meats and fruits. They are reminiscent of a rustic Polish casserole, known in various regions as ', etc. It is traditionally made from sliced or diced potatoes, onions, carrots, sausages and bacon arranged in layers inside a cast-iron cauldron greased with lard and lined with cabbage leaves, which is placed in bonfire embers for baking.\nThe word \"'\" is not attested before the 17th century. At that time, it referred to any dish of finely chopped components, usually meat or fish – but no cabbage – doused generously with melted butter and heavily seasoned with sour, sweet and spicy ingredients. , head chef to Prince , who consistently used the diminutive form ', included several recipes for it in his ' (\"A Collection of Dishes\"), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include ' prepared with chopped capon, hazel grouse, carp, pike, and crawfish with beef marrow. Seasonings that appear in most of these recipes include onions, wine vinegar, lemon or lime juice, verjuice, sorrel, sugar, raisins, black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and cumin. A manuscript recipe collection from the family court, dating back to ca. 1686, contains instructions for cooking ' of roast beef, fried fish and even chopped ' (thin pancakes). ' (\"The Perfect Cook\"), a cookbook published by Wojciech Wielądko in 1783, contains recipes for beef, veal, wether mutton, oyster, as well as root vegetable ' (the latter was a mixture of carrots, parsnip, rutabaga and celeriac).\n\n' made entirely of meat and exotic spices was affordable only to the affluent Polish nobility. The 18th century saw the development of a poor man's version of the dish, known as ', or \"rascal's '\", in which vinegar and lemon juice were replaced with cheaper sauerkraut as the source of tartness. Sauerkraut and cabbage also acted as a filler allowing to reduce the amount of meat in the dish. Rascal's ' became common during the reign of King Augustus III of Poland (r. 1734–1763). Over the course of the 19th century, its rise in popularity continued as the proportion of meat decreased in favor of sauerkraut, eventually superseding all other kinds of \" and losing the disparaging epithet in the process.\n\n\" is considered a Polish national dish, which, according to American food historian William Woys Weaver, \"has been romanticized in poetry, discussed in its most minute details in all sorts of literary contexts, and never made in small quantities.\"\n\nThe most famous literary monument to ' can be found in ', a mock-heroic poem venerated as the Polish national epic, extolling the country life of Polish noblemen in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, written by Adam Mickiewicz in 1834. It describes a group of men out in the woods, enjoying the stew of \"wondrous taste, colour and marvellous smell\" after a successful bear hunt.\n\n\n"}

It is a dark, heavy bread which is often bought sliced, in varieties from light-coloured rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. It forms the basis of \"smørrebrød\", which is closely related to the Swedish \"smörgås\". Some toppings are served on \"franskbrød\" (lit. \"French bread\"), a very light, crusty wheat bread. The bread is usually buttered, though for some variants, a spread of lard is customary.\n\nTraditional toppings include pickled herrings (plain, spiced or curried), slightly sweeter than Dutch or German herrings; thinly sliced cheese in many varieties; sliced cucumber, tomato and boiled eggs; pork liver-paste; dozens of types of cured or processed meat in thin slices, or smoked fish such as salmon; mackerel in tomato sauce; pickled cucumber; boiled egg, and rings of red onion. Mayonnaise mixed with peas, sliced boiled asparagus and diced carrot, called \"italiensk salat\" (lit. \"Italian salad\", so named because the colours match the Italian flag), remoulade or other thick sauces often top the layered open sandwich, which is usually eaten with utensils. It is custom to pass the dish of sliced breads around the table, and then to pass around each dish of toppings, and people help themselves.\n\nMore festive meals can be loosely divided into courses: Fish toppings first (such as herring, shrimp, or smoked salmon) followed by cold cuts and salads, and finally cheese with bread or crackers and a little fruit. One or several warm dishes are often served with the meats on special occasions, for example: breaded plaice filet, fried \"medister\" sausage, \"frikadeller\" with pickled red cabbage, or \"mørbradbøf\" (pork tenderloin with sauteed onions or a creamy mushroom sauce). Toppings change with the seasons and some are mostly associated with Easter or Christmas lunches, like head cheese and \"æbleflæsk\" (lit. \"apple pork\", roast pork or bacon in apple sauce).

The dessert came to Medieval India with the many Muslim merchants and dynasties that settled in the Indian subcontinent in the 16th to 18th century. The present form of falooda was developed by the Mughal Empire and spread with its many conquests. Muslim rulers who succeeded from the Mughals patronized the dessert with their own adaptations, specifically in Hyderabad Deccan and the Carnatic areas of present-day India.

It is usually made by heating whole fresh milk to near-boiling, adding an acidifying agent such as vinegar, stirring until curds form, then draining the curds in cheesecloth for three to five hours. Such cheeses are also known as \"bag cheeses\", as the curds are normally hung in a bag of cheesecloth to drain. Many Mexican home cooks make their own instead of purchasing it; when made for the evening meal, it is often prepared in early afternoon and left to drain until evening. As it is highly perishable, it must be refrigerated or used immediately once the whey has drained out.\n\nIf it is pressed, and more water is removed, it becomes known as \"queso seco\". Sometimes it is made by pressing the whey from cottage cheese. \n\nQueso blanco is traditionally made from cow's milk, whereas queso fresco may be made from a combination of cow's and goat's milk.

Coasters protect the surface of a table or any other surface where the user might place a drink. Coasters placed on top of a beverage can also be used to show that a drink is not finished or to prevent contamination (usually from insects). Coasters can also stop hot drinks burning the table surface. \n\nPubs usually will have beermats spread out across their surfaces. They are used not just to protect the surface of the table, but, as they are usually made of paper, they can also be used to absorb condensation dripping along the glass or serve as an ad-hoc notepad. Beermats are often branded with trademarks or alcohol advertising. Beermats are not to be confused with bar mats, rectangular pieces of rubber or absorbent material used to protect the countertop and limit the spread of spilled drinks in a bar or pub.\n\nThe first coasters were designed for decanters or wine bottles, so that they could be slid (or \"coasted\") around the dinner table after the servants had retired. They were in common use after about 1760. Early coasters took the form of a shallow tray or dish made of wood, papier-mâché, silver or silver plate.\n\nIn 1880, the first beermats made of cardboard were introduced by the German printing company, Friedrich Horn. In 1892, of Dresden manufactured the first beermat made of wood pulp. Watney brewery introduced them to the United Kingdom in 1920 to advertise their pale ale. The packaging company Quarmby Promotions, established in 1872, began manufacturing beermats in Milnsbridge in 1931. After Quarmby Promotions was taken over by the Katz Group, it moved production to Brighouse and in 2006 to Morley, West Yorkshire, before closing its production in 2009.\n\nSaucers are also long used in western culture for much the same purpose. When drinking tea, it is customary to use a cup and saucer set. By the mid-twentieth century, drink coasters made in many materials and styles were being manufactured for domestic use. Today, they are common as an everyday houseware piece and are also used in restaurants.\n\nCoasters are often made from high grammage paperboard, but may also be made from several layers of tissue paper. Important parameters for beer mats are water absorbency, wet rub and printability.\n\nMore recently, glass coasters with empty frames have been produced. The consumer can then personalize each one with a different picture or design. More recently some beermat manufacturers have overhauled their manufacturing processes, allowing them to supply bespoke pulpboard beermats in quantities as low as 100 without significant price premiums associated with smaller print orders. This has expanded the reach of the beermat with individuals choosing to have bespoke beermats printed for their wedding and political parties utilising them to deliver campaign messages. \n\nCoaster Factory and Canada Coaster, based in North America, and The Katz Group, based in Weisenbach, Germany, produce approximately 75% of the estimated 5.5 billion beermats in the world, including about two-thirds of the European market and 97% of the US market. In addition to the factory in Weisenbach, Katz has another two conversion factories in the U.S.: one in Sanborn, New York, and the other in Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\nDrink coasters are also made from soapstone, metal, wood and silicone.\n\nBeermats are usually adorned with a customized image—usually mentioning or advertising a brand of beer, although they can also be used to promote a drinking establishment, sports franchise, businesses or special events.\n\nSome coasters are collectible items. \"Tegestology\" is a term coined from Latin (\"teges\", -\"etis\", \"covering, mat\") defined as the practice of collecting beermats or coasters, with practitioners known as \"tegestologists\".

Porchetta is usually heavily salted in addition to being stuffed with garlic, rosemary, fennel, or other herbs, often wild. Porchetta has been selected by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policy as a \"prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale\" (“traditional agricultural-food product”, one of a list of traditional Italian foods held to have cultural relevance).\n\nAlthough popular in the whole country, porchetta originated in central Italy, with Ariccia (in the Province of Rome) being the town most closely associated with it. Elsewhere, it is considered a celebratory dish. Across Italy, porchetta is usually sold by pitchmen with their typically white-painted vans, especially during public displays or holidays, and it can be served in a panino. It's a common street food in Rome and Lazio served as a filling for pizza bianca. It is also eaten as a meat dish in many households or as part of a picnic.\n\nPorchetta is one of two iconic culinary products of the Lazio region, the other being the sheep cheese pecorino romano. Porchetta is also common in Abruzzo. \"Porchetta abruzzese\" is generally slow roasted with rosemary, garlic, and pepper. Porchetta from Umbria is stuffed with the pig's chopped entrails mixed with lard, garlic, salt and plenty of pepper and wild fennel.\n\nPorchetta \"trevigiana\" (from Treviso) was developed in 1919. In it, a pig is slaughtered when one year old, then its meat is stuffed with salt, pepper, wild fennel, garlic and white wine. It is then roasted inside an oven for seven hours at . The porchetta is today a popular dish in Venetian cuisine.\n\nThe dish is also a staple of Sardinian cuisine. There it is known as \"porceddu\" and is roasted over juniper and myrtle wood fires.\n\nPorchetta was introduced to the United States by Italian immigrants of the early 20th century, especially immigrants from Abruzzo, and is sometimes referred to as \"Italian pulled pork,\" \"roast pork,\" or \"Italian roast pork.\" It is, in many places, served on a sandwich with greens (rapini or spinach) and provolone cheese.\n\nIn Philadelphia and the surrounding area, the dish is usually referred to as simply \"roast pork,\" \"roast pork sandwich,\" \"Italian roast pork,\" \"roast pork Italian,\" \"roasted pork,\" or \"porchetta.\" Philadelphia cuisine is noted for its sandwich form of porchetta, usually served on an Italian roll and often with broccoli rabe instead of spinach and most traditionally with sharp provolone. \"Roast pork\" is a staple of Philadelphia Italian-American and South Philadelphia cuisine, with restaurants such as DiNic's Roast Pork in the Reading Terminal Market and John's Roast Pork, Esposito's Porchetta, and Tony Luke's in South Philadelphia being well known for their porchetta or \"roast pork\" sandwiches.\n\nBridgeport, Connecticut, has a Saturday afternoon lunch tradition of porchetta sandwiches served at community restaurants and taverns that dates back to the first wave of Italian immigration in the early 20th century.

The burger sold for and equaled 1,000 Calories. Erika Celeste, for NPR's \"All Things Considered\" detailed a \"doughnut burger\" sold at the 2010 Indiana State Fair when discussing the imaginative and caloric \"arms race\" at state fairgrounds to devise new \"wackier\" menu items: \"[a] fresh patty of beef and melted cheese sandwiched between two glazed doughnuts\". The Indiana vendor explained his impetus to sell the burger after seeing Paula Deen \"[do] it on TV\". The burger was described as having a salty-sweet taste, and surprisingly ungreasy. The \"Krispy Kreme Doughnut Burger\" as served at the 2010 Mississippi State Fair was garnished with \"lettuce, tomato and a generous slice of raw onion\", and was estimated to provide . The Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tulsa State Fairs also served up Luther Burger variants in 2010.\n\nEpic Burgers and Waffles (EBW) introduced their doughnut cheeseburger to the 2011 Canadian National Exhibition; they were inspired after seeing it at fairs in the Southern United States and noting its popularity at the Calgary Stampede the month before.

A course in a medieval feast often began with one or two potages, which would be followed by roasted meats.\n\nEuropean cottage gardens often contained a variety of crops grown together. These were called \"potage gardens\" by the French, as the harvest from that garden was used to make potage.\n\nThe earliest known cookery manuscript in the English language, \"The Forme of Cury\", written by the court chefs of King Richard II in 1390, contains several potage recipes including one made from cabbage, ham, onions and leeks. A slightly later manuscript from the 1430s is called \" Potage Dyvers\" (\"Various Potages\"). The word \"pottage\" is used in the earliest English translations of the Bible, in relation to the lentil soup for which Esau trades his birthright in ; from this story, the phrase \"mess of pottage\" means something attractive but of little value being exchanged for something much more important. During the Tudor period, a good many English peasants' diets consisted almost solely of potage. Some Tudor-era people ate self-cultivated vegetables like cabbages and carrots and a few were able to supplement this from fruit gardens with fruit trees nearby.\n\nSome potages that were typical of medieval cuisine were frumenty, jelly (flesh or fish in aspic), mawmenny (a thickened stew of capon or similar fowl), and pears in syrup. There were also many kinds of potages made of thickened liquids (such as milk and almond milk) with mashed flowers or mashed or strained fruit.\n\n\n"}

Fujian cuisine is known to be light but flavourful, soft, and tender, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as \"xianwei\" (), as well as retaining the original flavour of the main ingredients instead of masking them.\n\nMany diverse seafood and woodland delicacies are used, including a myriad variety of local fish, shellfish and turtles, or indigenous edible mushrooms and bamboo shoots, provided by the coastal and mountainous regions of Fujian. The most commonly employed cooking techniques in the region's cuisine include braising, stewing, steaming and boiling.\n\nParticular attention is paid on the finesse of knife skills and cooking technique of the chefs, which is used to enhance the flavour, aroma and texture of seafood and other foods. Strong emphasis is put on the making and utilising of broth and soups. There are sayings in the region's cuisine: \"One broth can be changed into numerous (ten) forms\" () and \"It is unacceptable for a meal to not have soup\" ().\n\nFermented fish sauce, known locally as \"shrimp oil\" (), is also commonly used in the cuisine, along with oyster, crab and shrimp. Peanuts (utilised for both savoury dishes and desserts) are also prevalent, and can be boiled, fried, roasted, crushed, ground or even turned into a paste. Peanuts can be used as a garnish, feature in soups and even be added to braised or stir-fried dishes. \n\nFujian cuisine has had a profound impact on Taiwanese cuisine and on the overseas Chinese cuisines found in Southeast Asia as the majority of Taiwanese and Southeast Asian Chinese people have ancestral roots in Fujian province.\n\nFujian cuisine consists of three styles:\n\nUnique seasonings from Fujian include fish sauce, shrimp paste, sugar, shacha sauce and preserved apricot. Wine lees from the production of rice wine is also commonly used in all aspects of the region's cuisine. Red yeast rice () is also commonly used in Fujian cuisine, imparting a rosy-red hue to the foods, pleasant aroma, and slightly sweet taste.\n\nFujian is also well known for its \"drunken\" (wine marinated) dishes and is famous for the quality of the soup stocks and bases used to flavour their dishes, soups and stews.\n\nOne of the most famous dishes in Fujian cuisine is \"Buddha Jumps Over the Wall\", a complex dish making use of many ingredients, including shark's fin, sea cucumber, abalone and Shaoxing wine.\n\nFujian is also notable for yanpi (), literally \"swallow skin,\" a thin wrapper made with large proportions of lean minced pork. This wrapper has a unique texture due to the incorporation of meat and has a \"bite\" similar to things made with surimi. Yanpi is used to make \"rouyan\" (), a type of wonton.\n\nThere are many eating places around the province that sell these specialties for two yuan, and which are thus known as \"two-yuan eateries\". In Xiamen, a local specialty is worm jelly (), an aspic made from a species of marine peanut worm.\n\n"}

The name came about after dim sum was misspelled on a menu and the mistake went unnoticed and was picked up by other Australian sellers. The commercial snack food normally consists of minced meat (usually pork, lamb or chicken), cabbage, and seasoning, encased in a wrapper similar to that of a traditional \"shumai\" dumpling. They can be served deep-fried or steamed and are commonly dressed or dipped in soy sauce. They are either served in a common rectangular shape, or in a slightly larger circular shape. An alternative way of cooking dim sims is to barbecue them, by cutting the dim sim in half along the long side and placing on a hot BBQ. Vegetarian-style dim sim normally contains cabbage, carrot, vermicelli, Chinese shiitake mushroom or other vegetable fillings, along with seasoning, although these are not generally available in commercial outlets. Dim sims differ from typical Chinese dumplings in that they are often much larger, have a thicker, doughier skin and are shaped more robustly.\nThey are primarily sold in fish and chip shops, service stations, corner shops, and some Chinese restaurants and takeaway outlets in Australia. Chinese \"yum cha\" wholesale outlets and Asian frozen food companies also commonly sell this snack frozen for home cooking. They can also be found at Chinese food outlets in New Zealand. The round end of a dim sim is considered the top. \n\nThe term \"dim sim\" dates as far back as 1928, although the modern recipe of the dish most likely was developed in Melbourne's Chinatown in 1945 by entrepreneur William Wing Young (father of TV chef Elizabeth Chong) for his food processing company Wing Lee. The larger circular version of the dish is commonly known as a \"South Melbourne Dim Sim\" due to it originating at South Melbourne Market.\n\nWilliam Wing Young's \"original recipe\" for the dim sim was presented by Elizabeth Chong on the second episode of the ABC1 TV show \"Myf Warhurst's Nice\" (20 June 2012). It consisted of pork, prawns, water chestnuts, spring onions and soy sauce wrapped in a soft skin-like wrapper.\n\n"}

In this manner, two nucleobases, one on each strand, can be held together by hydrogen bonds in the major groove. A Hoogsteen base pair applies the N7 position of the purine base (as a hydrogen bond acceptor) and C6 amino group (as a donor), which bind the Watson-Crick (N3–C4) face of the pyrimidine base.\n\nTen years after James Watson and Francis Crick published their model of the DNA double helix, Karst Hoogsteen reported a crystal structure of a complex in which analogues of A and T formed a base pair that had a different geometry from that described by Watson and Crick. Similarly, an alternative base-pairing geometry can occur for G•C pairs. Hoogsteen pointed out that if the alternative hydrogen-bonding patterns were present in DNA, then the double helix would have to assume a quite different shape. Hoogsteen base pairs are, however, rarely observed.\n\nHoogsteen pairs have quite different properties from Watson-Crick base pairs. The angle between the two glycosidic bonds (ca. 80° in the A• T pair) is larger and the C1′–C1′ distance (ca. 860 pm or 8.6 Å) is smaller than in the regular geometry. In some cases, called \"reversed Hoogsteen base pair\"s, one base is rotated 180° with respect to the other.\n\nIn some DNA sequences, especially CA and TA dinucleotides, Hoogsteen base pairs exist as transient entities that are present in thermal equilibrium with standard Watson–Crick base pairs. The detection of the transient species required the use of NMR techniques that have only recently been applied to macromolecules.\n\nHoogsteen base pairs have been observed in protein–DNA complexes. Some proteins have evolved to recognize only one base-pair type, and use intermolecular interactions to shift the equilibrium between the two geometries.\n\nDNA has many features that allow its sequence-specific recognition by proteins. This recognition was originally thought to primarily involve specific hydrogen-bonding interactions between amino-acid side chains and bases. But it soon became clear that there was no identifiable one-to-one correspondence — that is, there was no simple code to be read. Part of the problem is that DNA can undergo conformational changes that distort the classical double helix. The resulting variations alter the presentation of DNA bases to proteins molecules and thus affect the recognition mechanism.\n\nAs distortions in the double helix are themselves are dependent on base sequence, proteins are able to recognize DNA in a manner similar to the way that they recognize other proteins and small ligand molecules, i.e. via geometric shape (instead of the specific sequence). For example, stretches of A and T bases can lead to narrowing the minor groove of DNA (the narrower of the two grooves in the double helix), resulting in enhanced local negative electrostatic potentials which in turn creates binding sites for positively charged arginine amino-acid residues on the protein.\n\nThis non-Watson-Crick base-pairing allows the third strands to wind around the duplexes, which are assembled in the Watson-Crick pattern, and form triple-stranded helices such as (poly(dA)•2poly(dT)) and (poly(rG)•2poly(rC)). It can be also seen in three-dimensional structures of transfer RNA, as T54•A58 and U8•A14.\n\nHoogsteen pairs also allows formation of secondary structures of single stranded DNA and RNA G-rich called G-quadruplexes (G4-DNA and G4-RNA) at least in vitro. It needs four triplets of G, separated by short spacers. This permits assembly of planar quartets which are composed of stacked associations of Hoogsteen bonded guanine molecules.\n\nWatson and Crick base pairs are indicated by a \"•\", \"-\", or a \".\" (example: A•T, or poly(rC)•2poly(rC)).\n\nHoogsteen triple-stranded DNA base pairs are indicated by a \"*\" or a \":\" (example: C•G*C+, T•A*T, C•G*G, or T•A*A).\n\n"}

The main ingredients are many; ragouts may be prepared with or without meat, a wide variety of vegetables may be incorporated, and they may be more or less heavily spiced and seasoned.\n\nTwo 18th-century English dishes from \"The Compleat Housewife\" show some of the varying meats, vegetables, seasonings, garnishes and procedures which can be applied to the ragoût.\n\n\"A Ragoo for made Dishes\" <br>\nTAKE claret, gravy, sweet-herbs, and savoury spice, toss up in it lamb-stones (i.e. lamb’s testicles), cock's-combs, boiled, blanched, and sliced, with sliced sweet-meats, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, and murrels; thicken these with brown butter; use it when called for.\n\n\"To make a Ragoo of Pigs-Ears\"<br>\nTAKE a quantity of pigs-ears, and boil them in one half wine and the other water; cut them in small pieces, then brown a little butter, and put them in, and a pretty deal of gravy, two anchovies, an eschalot or two, a little mustard, and some slices of lemon, some salt and nutmeg: stew all these together, and shake it up thick.

There are numerous different varieties of Syrian cheese found all throughout the Levant such as the Kenafa, Surke, Baladi, and Tresse cheeses.\n\nSome of the most common types of cheese from Syria are:\n\nAckawi (also Akawi and Akawieh) is a white cheese with a complex flavor. It originates from the town of Akko (Palestine). The cheese is commonly made using pasteurized cow's milk, but can be made with goat or sheep's milk as well. It is produced on a large scale in Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Cyprus.\n\nBaladi is a soft-white, smooth, creamy cheese has a mild flavour, usually spread on fresh bread or crackers. It is most often eaten for breakfast or snacks. Baladi is a fresh, traditionally unpasteurized, and uncultured cheese made with a mixture of goat, cow and sheep's milk. The diverse microflora, high moisture, uncultured, and unpasteurized nature tends limit the shelf life to 3 days.\n\nCharkassiyea is a soft, fresh cheese.\n\nJibneh Arabieh (Arabic for: Arab cheese) is a simple cheese found all over the Middle East. It is particularly popular in Egypt and Arab countries of the Arabic Gulf. The cheese has an open texture and a mild taste. The heritage of the product started with Bedouins, using goat or sheep milk, however current practice is to use cow's milk to make the cheese. Jibneh Arabieh is used for cooking, or simply as a table cheese.\n\nJibne Baida (Arabic for white cheese) is a white hard cheese with a pronounced salty taste, often boiled before eating.\n\nKenafa is an unsalted, very fresh, soft cheese that melts easily and freely. It is used to make the popular \"cheesecake\", like dessert that is sometimes called Kenafa by people in the Middle East, mainly the Levant and Egypt. It can also be used as a base for other sweet cheese desserts. It is sold frozen because there is no salt in it and is available in both retail and bulk packages.\n\nMajdoule is a salty white cheese made up of thick strands of cheese braided together (hence the name)\n\nShelal is a salty white cheese made up of strands of cheese woven together\n\nSurke, also called sorke or shanklish, is a mature cheese made with spices and generally presented as balls of cheese covered in za'tar orchile powder; most often eaten as a starter dish with tomato, oil and sometimes onion\n\nTresse cheese, also known by its Arabic name \"Jibneh Mshallaleh\" is a form of string cheese originating in Syria.\n\nTurkomani is a soft porous cheese with a delicate flavor.\n\nKastha (or Kishta) is a heavy cream that is very popular in the Middle East. Traditionally, it is made by skimming the thickest part of the cream from whey. The product is used both as an ingredient in cooking and is mixed with honey to be eaten as an incredibly rich dessert. . It has a sixty-day refrigerated shelf life.\n"}
{"id": "1967710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1967710", "title": "Semi-Slav Defense", "text": "Semi-Slav Defense\n\nThe Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit chess opening defined by the position reached after the moves:\nThe position may readily be reached by a number of different . With Black advancing pawns to both e6 and c6, the opening resembles a mixture of the Orthodox Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) and the Slav Defense.\n\nBlack is threatening to capture the white pawn on c4, and hold it with b7–b5. White can avoid this in a number of ways. About 80% of games continue 5.Bg5 or 5.e3: the former constitutes a sharp pawn sacrifice, while the latter restricts the dark-squared bishop from its natural development to g5. Other possible moves are 5.Qb3, 5.g3 and 5.cxd5, the last of which, after 5...exd5, leads to a line of the QGD Exchange Variation where White's early Nf3 enables Black's queen bishop to freely develop, which should give equality (\"ECO\" codes D43 and D45).\n\nFor the Semi-Slav the \"Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings\" designates codes D43 through D49.\nThe main line continues with 5...Nbd7. The bishop moves 5...Bd6 and 5...Be7 are seldom seen, as masters realized early on that at e7, the bishop was passively placed and does nothing to further one of Black's aims, the freeing move ...e5. The unusual move 5...a6 is considered solid for Black. Some sources call 5...a6 the \"accelerated Meran\".\n\nThe main variation of the Semi-Slav is the Meran Variation, 6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 (\"ECO\" codes D46 to D49), when play usually continues with 8.Bd3, with 8.Be2 and 8.Bb3 less common alternatives. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter–Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. During a 1924 tournament in Meran, it was used successfully in the game Gruenfeld–Rubinstein. Gruenfeld adopted the same variation two rounds later against Spielmann, winning as well. Black surrenders his outpost on d5, gaining a tempo for expansion by b7–b5. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. These opposing strategies, with the ensuing keen play, have long made the Meran a favorite for enterprising players of either color. An example is Gligoric v Ljubojevic, Belgrade, 1979.\n\nAfter the move 8.Bd3, Black usually plays 8...a6. Bent Larsen introduced the move 8...Bb7, which has been dubbed the \"improved Meran\". According to one source, the move was first played in 1923, but since it was developed by Larsen, it carries his name. Black can also play 8...Bd6, which is the move Anand played in his victory over Levon Aronian in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2013.\n\nThough appearing in contemporary master play with less frequency than the Meran, there are other possibilities: 6...Be7, 6...Bb4, introduced by the Italian master Max Romih, and 6...Bd6, which was much the most popular line before the debut of the Meran, and espoused by the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier throughout his career.\n\n6...Bd6 and now 7. 0-0 0-0 8. e4 dxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxe4 10. Bxe4 is the most common line. There are now several alternatives for Black, with one a clear error, as it loses a pawn: 10... e5 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nxe5 Bxe5 13. Bxh7+ Kxh7 14. Qh5+ Kg8 15. Qxe5. This line, however, has a strong drawish tendency in practice, due to the opposite-colored bishops, although all the heavy pieces remain on the board.\n\nBlack's other choices include 10...c5, although theory regards this as premature as it enables White to play for a kingside attack with 11.Bc2, followed by Qd3 and Bg5. 10...Nf6 has also been played, but this misplaces the knight and does nothing to further Black's play against the center by means of the pawn breaks c6–c5 or e6–e5. Bisguier preferred 10...h6 and it has come to be considered the strongest plan.\n\nThe other ideas, 6...Be7, which has the same drawback as after 5.e3 Be7, and 6...Bb4, have become sidelines in modern play.\n\nThe main alternative to 6.Bd3 has become 6.Qc2, once a sideline, this move exploded in popularity in the 1990s, in large part due to Anatoly Karpov's advocacy. The idea is to wait for Black to commit to ...dxc4 before playing Bd3. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6 and now White can choose between two very different continuations:\n\n7.Bd3, Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances.\n\nAnother increasingly common gambit line used in the Anti-Meran is the sharp 7.g4. Popularized by Alexander Shabalov and Alexey Shirov, the gambit destabilizes the center for Black and has been successful for several grandmasters, including Kasparov, who won the first game of his 2003 match against the computer chess program Deep Junior with it.\n\nThe Anti-Meran Gambit (\"ECO\" code D44) arises after 5.Bg5. Possible replies include 5...Nbd7, 5...dxc4, 5...h6, and 5...Be7. White refuses to shut in the dark-squared bishop, instead developing it to an active square where it pins the black knight. It is now possible for Black to transpose to either the Cambridge Springs Defence with 5... Nbd7 6. e3 Qa5, or enter the Orthodox Defense with 6...Be7.\n\nThis line is extremely complicated, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. Black a pawn by 5...dxc4. White takes control of the center with 6.e4 as Black defends with 6...b5. The main line of the Botvinnik now continues 7. e5 h6 8. Bh4 g5 9. Nxg5 hxg5 10. Bxg5 Nbd7. White will regain his piece with interest, emerging with an extra pawn, but Black will soon complete his development, gaining great dynamic compensation, whereas White's task is rather more difficult. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle , while Black will play c5, Qb6, castle queenside, and can carry out an attack in the center or on either flank, leading to complex play. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1945 USSR vs USA radio match vs Arnold Denker. Today, Alex Yermolinsky has an excellent record with the white pieces and Alexei Shirov has been Black's chief proponent in this variation. Although this variation bears Botvinnik's name, he was not the first person known to have played it—Klaus Junge is credited as the actual inventor.\n\nThe Moscow Variation 5... h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a different character from the Botvinnik variation. Black has the bishop pair, which gives him good long-term chances, but must avoid prematurely opening the position in the face of White's superior development and central control, as his position is initially solid but passive. Alexei Dreev has played this line successfully as Black. The gambit line 6.Bh4 (the Anti-Moscow Variation) was once considered dubious, but has seen a recent resurgence. In return for the pawn, White receives a lead in development and a strong initiative. This dynamic line, which is characteristic of the modern game, has been played by many strong grandmasters, with the theoretical verdict remaining inconclusive.\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The epi layer may be the same material as the substrate, typically monocrystaline silicon, or it may be a more exotic material with specific desirable qualities.\n\nSilicon epi wafers were first developed around 1966, and achieved commercial acceptance by the early 1980s. Methods for growing the epitaxial layer on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). \nTwo \"kerfless\" methods (without abrasive sawing) for separating the epitaxial layer from the substrate are called \"implant-cleave\" and \"stress liftoff\". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit a thin layer of crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following cleavage step. In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times.\n\nThe epitaxial layers may consist of compounds with particular desirable features such as gallium nitride (GaN), gallium arsenide (GaAs), or some combination of the elements gallium, indium, aluminum, nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic.\n\nSolar cells, or photovoltaic cells (PV) for producing electric power from sunlight can be grown as thick epi wafers on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250 µm) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at atmospheric pressure in a high-throughput inline process. In September 2015, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) announced the achievement of an efficiency above 20% for such cells. The work on optimizing the production chain was done in collaboration with NexWafe GmbH, a company spun off from Fraunhofer ISE to commercialize production. The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption. In April 2016, the company Crystal Solar of Santa Clara, California, in collaboration with the European research institute IMEC announced that they achieved a 22.5% cell efficiency of an epitaxial silicon cell with an nPERT (n-type passivated emitter, rear totally-diffused) structure grown on 6-inch (150 mm) wafers. In September 2015 presented an achieved conversion efficiency of 21.4% (independently confirmed) for screen-printed solar cells made with Crystal Solar epitaxial wafers.\n\nIn June 2015, it was reported that heterojunction solar cells grown epitaxially on n-type monocrystalline silicon wafers had reached an efficiency of 22.5% over a total cell area of 243.4 cmformula_1.\n\nIn 2016, a new approach was described for producing hybrid photovoltaic wafers combining the high efficiency of III-V multi-junction solar cells with the economies and wealth of experience associated with silicon. The technical complications involved in growing the III-V material on silicon at the required high temperatures, a subject of study for some 30 years, are avoided by epitaxial growth of silicon on GaAs at low temperature by Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)\n\n"}

A metropolitan wears a white epanokamelavkion with the same jewelled cross.

Ref: Wiktionary, the latin word Filatory)\nThe Latin word \"filatorium\" is being used to describe Filet lace then Jourdain (1904) quotes a reference to Exeter Cathedral possessing four pieces of Filet lace in 1327. Ingram (1922) states that there was a \"cushion of net-work in St. Paul's Cathedral so early as 1295.\" Such work, in the 14th century, was also described as \"opus araneum\".\n\nFilet-work is the result of knotting a fabric of diagonal or square meshes to create an open fabric called Lace. The tool to make a Knotted Net Lace is a Shuttle-Needle and a Gauge stick for measure of the meshes.\n\nThe book Renaissance Patterns for Lace, Embroidery and Needlepoint, an unabridged facsimile of the \"Singuliers et nouveaux pourtraicts\" of 1587 by Federico de Vinciolo contains approximately 50 beautiful and well designed patterns which are suitable for Filet lace-Embroidery on Knotted Net using the Linen Stitch.\n\nAs mentioned above, filet lace is created by doing embroidery stitches on a knotted net lace. The knotted ground lace can either be made by the lacemaker or as of 2003 purchased commercially in either handmade or machine-made varieties (available at Filet Lace by the Sea).\n\nMaking the net by hand with a shuttle needle and a gauge involves anchoring the piece, using either a heavy cushion (which Carità (1909) recommends be made of lead but should be replaced by sand or a C clip), a chair or a stirrup around the worker’s foot. Having a secure anchor against which to maintain tension, a square net is made starting from one corner and adding a new mesh on each row until the desired size is reached, then by decreasing. The individual meshes are formed on a gauge which helps ensure a uniform size and are created by knotting to a loop in the previous round: square mesh, diagonal mesh, circular, free form.\nBy using a very fine thread and different sizes of gauge you will create a beautiful and delicate lace work.\n\nThe Knotted Lace is then stretched on a frame and embroidery stitches are added using a long blunt needle and a thread. Patterns are designed on a grid with a mark for the meshes to be filled with the thread. A path (or direction) is traced on this pattern and then you follow this path with the needle on the ground lace. \nWhen a group of certain stitches are used, the technique takes a name: Filet Guipure, Filet Richelieu, Filet Soutache\", \"Linen Stitch (Point de Toile), Darning Stitch (Point de Reprise); And then, when a region recognize it, it becomes French Filet, Filet di Bosa, Filet Italien, Filet de Gruyère, Russian Filet Guipure, etc. \n\nMany designs involve weaving the main design in linen stitch, indeed some designs consist entirely of linen stitch. This creates solid and open areas on the piece. A geometrical design or a sampler can use several different stitches, when a figural design will use very few stitches or only the linen stitch. \n\nFilet lace is often seen in a single color of thread, usually white or ecru, but countries all over the world have used colored thread, precious metal threads, wool, feathers, etc.\n\n\n"}

The distinction between the sacred and the profane was considered by Émile Durkheim to be central to the social reality of human religion.\n\nThe profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the \"Lebenswelt\" or lifeworld.\n\nIn contrast, the sacred, or \"sacrum\" in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or numinous can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an amulet for example may be sacred yet little respected.\n\nRites of passage represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.\n\nReligion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.\n\nModernization and the Enlightenment project have led to a secularisation of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred. The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.\n\nCarl Jung expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.\n\nThe advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. Modernism set out to bring myth and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality — Wallace Stevens speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.\n\nFundamentalism – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.\n\nPsychology too has set out to protect the boundaries of the individual self from profane intrusion, establishing ritual places for inward work in opposition to the postmodern loss of privacy.\n\nSeamus Heaney considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.\n\n"}

It is often eaten with boiled ham or Irish bacon. At one time it was a cheap, year-round staple food, though nowadays it is usually eaten in autumn/winter, when kale comes into season.\n\nAn Irish Halloween tradition is to serve colcannon with a ring and a thimble hidden in the dish. Prizes of small coins such as threepenny or sixpenny bits were also concealed inside the dish.\n\nThe origin of the word is unclear. The first syllable 'col' is likely derived from the Irish 'cál' meaning cabbage. The second syllable may derive from 'ceann-fhionn' meaning a white head (i.e. 'a white head of cabbage') - this use is also found in the Irish name for a coot, a white headed bird known as 'cearc cheannan', or 'white-head hen'.

By contrast, \"ordinary\" hadrons contain just two or three quarks. Hadrons with explicit valence gluon content would also be considered exotic. In theory, there is no limit on the number of quarks in a hadron, as long as the hadron's color charge is white, or color-neutral.\n\nConsistent with ordinary hadrons, exotic hadrons are classified as being either fermions, like ordinary baryons, or bosons, like ordinary mesons. According to this classification scheme, pentaquarks, containing five valence quarks, are exotic baryons, while tetraquarks (four valence quarks) and hexaquarks (six quarks, consisting of either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs) would be considered exotic mesons. Tetraquark and pentaquark particles are believed to have been observed and are being investigated; Hexaquarks have not yet been confirmed as observed.\n\nExotic hadrons can be searched for by looking for S-matrix poles with quantum numbers forbidden to ordinary hadrons. Experimental signatures for such exotic hadrons have been seen by at least 2003 but remain a topic of controversy in particle physics.\n\nJaffe and Low suggested that the exotic hadrons manifest themselves as poles of the P matrix, and not of the S matrix. Experimental P-matrix poles are determined reliably in both the meson-meson channels and nucleon-nucleon channels.\n\nWhen the quark model was first postulated by Murray Gell-Mann and others in the 1960s, it was to organize the states known then to be in existence in a meaningful way. As quantum chromodynamics (QCD) developed over the next decade, it became apparent that there was no reason why only three-quark and quark-antiquark combinations could exist. Indeed, Gell-Mann's original 1964 paper alludes to the possibility of exotic hadrons and classifies hadrons into baryons and mesons depending upon whether they have an odd (baryon) or even (meson) number of valence quarks. In addition, it seemed that gluons, the mediator particles of the strong interaction, could also form bound states by themselves (glueballs) and with quarks (hybrid hadrons). Several decades have passed without conclusive evidence of an exotic hadron that could be associated with the S-matrix pole.\n\nIn April 2014, the LHCb collaboration confirmed the existence of the Z(4430), discovered by Belle, and demonstrated that it must have a minimal quark content of \"cd\".\n\nIn July 2015, LHCb announced the discovery of two particles, named and , which must have minimal quark content \"cuud\", making them pentaquarks.\n\nThere are several exotic hadron candidates:\n\n"}

It is related to the Greek verb \"kērússō\", literally meaning \"to cry or proclaim as a herald\" and being used in the sense of \"to proclaim, announce, preach\". Merriam-Webster defines it as \"the apostolic proclamation of salvation through Jesus Christ\". Amongst biblical scholars, the term has come to mean the core of the early church's oral tradition about Jesus.\n\n\"Kerygmatic\" is sometimes used to express the message of Jesus' whole ministry, as \"a proclamation addressed not to the theoretical reason, but to the hearer as a self\"; as opposed to the didactic use of Scripture that seeks understanding in the light of what is taught. The meaning of the crucifixion is central to this concept.\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, when the literary genre of the New Testament gospels was under debate, scholars like C. H. Dodd and Rudolf Bultmann suggested that the gospels were of a genre unique in the ancient world. They called the genre \"kerygma\" and described it as a later development of preaching that had taken a literary form. Scholarship since then has found problems with Bultmann's theory, but in Biblical and theological discussions, the term kerygma has come to denote the irreducible essence of Christian apostolic preaching.\n\nThe ancient Christian kerygma as summarized by Dodd from Peter's speeches in the New Testament Book of Acts was:\n\nThe New Testament is a collection of early Christian writings taken to be holy scripture.

The plural form is \"prosphora\" (). The term originally meant any offering made to a temple, but in Orthodox Christianity it has come to mean specifically the bread offered at the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist).\n\nProsphoro is made from only four ingredients, wheat flour (white), yeast, salt, and water. Salt was not used in early times and is still not used in the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem.\n\nAny member of the church who is in good standing and whose conscience is clean may bake prosphora. Often in a parish church the women will take turns baking the prosphora; in monasteries, the task is often assigned by the Hegumen (abbot or abbess) to one or several monastics of virtuous life.\n\nIt is common but not necessary to go to confession before baking prosphora, and it is often done in the morning while fasting. Sometimes, special kitchen implements are used for making the prosphora which are used for no other purpose. There may be special prayers said before commencing, and the baker tries to maintain a religious state of mind throughout, often saying the Jesus Prayer. Usually enough prosphora for a number of services are baked at the same time.\n\nA prosphoron is made up of two separate round pieces of leavened dough which are placed one on top of another and baked together to form a single loaf. This double-loaf represents the two natures of Christ: human and divine. Before baking, each prosphoron is stamped with a special seal called \"sphragis\" or \"Panagiari\", usually bearing, among other things, the image of a cross with the Greek letters IC XC NIKA (\"Jesus Christ conquers\") around the arms of the cross. This impression is baked into the bread and serves as a guide for the priest who will be cutting it.\n\nIn the Slavic practice (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, etc.) five smaller prosphora are used (in commemoration of the five loaves Jesus used to feed the multitudes). In the Greek practice one larger prosphoron is used (in commemoration that all share in one \"Bread\" ).\n\nIn the part of the Divine Liturgy (Eucharist) known as the Liturgy of Preparation (\"Proskomedia\"), a cube is cut from the center of the prosphoron, and is referred to as the Lamb (). It is this Lamb which is consecrated to become the Body of Christ and from it both the clergy and the faithful will receive Holy Communion, while the remainder of the prosphora is cut up for the \"antidoron\", the blessed bread which is distributed at the end of the Liturgy.\n\nThe motto \"the loaf of Nature's kitchen table,\" a common metaphor for returning thanks and agape (unconditional love) back to nature, is derived from prosphora.\n\nProsphora can vary in size and imprinted design in different liturgical traditions. Generally, the Slavic traditions use five small prosphora with a simpler stamp, while the Greek-Byzantine tradition uses one large prosphoron with a more complex stamp, indicating the place from which the Lamb is to be taken and the places from which particles are removed for each of the remaining commemorations.\n\nIn addition to the Lamb, particles are removed from the prosphoron to commemorate the following:\n\nThe Slavic tradition uses a separate prosphoron for each of these, sometimes with a different seal for each prosphoron—or at least a distinctive one for the \"Panagia\". The laity may also present smaller prosphora together with a list of the faithful living and departed whom they wish to have commemorated during the Liturgy. From each of these smaller prosphora the priest will remove a triangular piece as well as several smaller particles while he prays for each of the persons listed.\n\nThe Prosphoron from which a particle is removed in honor of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary) is called \"Panagia\" (ἄρτος τῆς Παναγίας) and is solemnly blessed in her honour during the Divine Liturgy. This prosphoron is often stamped with an icon of the Theotokos. Before cutting this prosphoron, the priest makes the Sign of the Cross over it three times with the litugical spear, saying:\n\nIn honour and commemoration of our most blessed Lady, the Theotokos and Ever-virgin Mary; through whose intercessions accept, O Lord, this sacrifice upon Thy most heavenly Altar.\n\nHe then removes a large, triangular particle and places it to the side of the Lamb, as he says: \"At Thy right hand stood the queen, arrayed in vesture wrought of gold and diverse colours.\"\n\nThe remainder of the prosphoron is blessed over the holy table, before the blessing of the antidoron, with the phrase \"Great is the name of the Holy Trinity.\" Today, this practice is usually performed only in some monasteries.\n\nAfter the Liturgy, a triangular portion is cut from the prosphoron by the refectorian (monk in charge of the refectory). The \"Panagia\" is then cut in half and laid crust downwards on a dish in a small table in the refectory. After the meal, the refectorian takes off his epanokamelavkion and kamilavkion, saying, \"Bless me, holy Fathers, and pardon me a sinner,\" to which the brotherhood replies, \"May God pardon and have mercy on you.\" Then, taking the \"Panagia\" in his fingertips, he lifts it up while saying, \"Great is the Name,\" and then the community continues with \"of the Holy Trinity.\" The rite then continues with \"All-holy Mother of God, help us\" with the reply \"At her prayers, O God, have mercy and save us.\" Two hymns are then sung while the refectorian, accompanied by a cleric with a hand censer, offers the \"Panagia\" to those assembled. Each takes a piece between his finger and thumb, passes it through the incense, and then eats it.\n\nThere are also loaves which are baked for blessing and distribution to the faithful outside of the Divine Liturgy. These are generally called \"artos\" (\"loaves\") and are usually made from a single round of dough rather than two. They may be stamped with the same seal used at the Liturgy, though usually they have only a simple cross or an icon such as the patron saint of the local church or monastery. Five loaves are usually made, and they are blessed at a service called the Artoklasia (\"breaking of bread\"). These loaves, together with wheat, wine, and oil, are blessed and distributed to the faithful during the All-Night Vigil.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1986238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1986238", "title": "Polarity item", "text": "Polarity item\n\nIn linguistics, a polarity item is a lexical item that can appear only in environments associated with a particular grammatical polarity – affirmative or negative. A polarity item that appears in affirmative (positive) contexts is called a positive polarity item (PPI), and one that appears in negative contexts is a negative polarity item (NPI).\n\nThe environment in which a polarity item is permitted to appear is called a \"licensing context\". In the simplest case, an affirmative statement provides a licensing context for a PPI, while negation provides a licensing context for an NPI. However, there are many complications, and not all polarity items of a given type need necessarily have exactly the same set of licensing contexts.\n\nAs examples of polarity items, consider the English lexical items \"somewhat\" and \"at all\", as used in the following sentences:\n\nAs can be seen, \"somewhat\" is licensed by the affirmative environment of sentence (1), but it is forbidden (anti-licensed) by the negative environment of sentence (4). It can therefore be considered to be a positive polarity item (PPI). On the other hand, \"at all\" is licensed by the negative environment of sentence (2), but anti-licensed by the positive environment of sentence (3), and is therefore considered a negative polarity item (NPI). \n\nBecause standard English does not have negative concord, that is, double negatives are not used to intensify each other, the language makes frequent use of certain NPIs that correspond in meaning to negative items, and can be used in the environment of another negative. For example, \"anywhere\" is an NPI corresponding to the negative \"nowhere\", as used in the following sentences:\nNote that the alternative form with the double negative, *\"I was not going nowhere\", is ungrammatical in the standard language, although such forms are used in some colloquial English, and parallel the constructions used in certain other languages which have negative concord. (Note also that \"anywhere\", like most of the other NPIs listed below, is also used in other senses where it is not an NPI, as in \"I would go anywhere with you\".) Similar pairs of negatives and corresponding NPI are listed below.\n\nSee also , and .\n\nThe actual set of contexts that license particular polarity items is not as easily defined as a simple distinction between affirmative and negative sentences. Baker noted that double negation may provide an acceptable context for positive polarity items:\n\nHowever, licensing contexts can take many forms besides simple negation/affirmation. To complicate matters, polarity items appear to be highly idiosyncratic, each with its own set of licensing contexts.\n\nEarly discussion of polarity items can be found in the work of Otto Jespersen and Edward Klima. Much of the research on polarity items has centered around the question of what creates a negative context. In the late 1970s, William Ladusaw (building on work by Gilles Fauconnier) discovered that most English NPIs are licensed in downward entailing environments. This is known as the Fauconnier–Ladusaw hypothesis. A downward entailing environment, however, is not a necessary condition for an NPI to be licensed—they may be licensed by some non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) contexts, like \"exactly N\", as well. \nNor is a downward entailing environment a sufficient condition for all negative polarity items, as first pointed out by Zwarts (1981) for Dutch \"ook maar\".\n\nLicensing contexts across languages include the scope of n-words (negative particles, negative quantifiers), the antecedent of conditionals, questions, the restrictor of universal quantifiers, non-affirmative verbs (doubt), adversative predicates (be surprised), negative conjunctions (without), comparatives and superlatives, \"too\"-phrases, negative predicates (unlikely), some subjunctive complements, some disjunctions, imperatives, and others (finally, only). Given this wide range of mostly non-downward entailing environments, the Fauconnier-Ladusaw Hypothesis has gradually been replaced in favor of theories based on the notion of nonveridicality (proposed by Zwarts and Giannakidou).\n\nDifferent NPIs may be licensed by different expressions. Thus, while the NPI \"anything\" is licensed by the downward entailing expression \"at most two of the visitors\", the idiomatic NPI \"lift a finger\" (known as a \"minimizer\") is not licensed by the same expression.\n\nWhile NPIs have been discovered in many languages, their distribution is subject to substantial cross-linguistic variation; this aspect of NPIs is currently the subject of ongoing research in cross-linguistic semantics.\n\n\n\n"}

It soon grew and diversified into fields such as fertilizer and retailing farm supplies. It soon entered the poultry business. In 1998 it exited the agronomy business to focus on protein products, primarily chicken but also pork. In 2004, with the approval of its membership, it converted from being a cooperative to a for-profit stock-ownership company, listed on NASDAQ. In 2006, Gold Kist was acquired by Pilgrim's Pride.\n\nGold Kist operated nine fully integrated poultry divisions in Alabama, Georgia, Florida and North and South Carolina. Each division operated its own hatchery, feed mill, and processing plant.\n\nGold Kist contracted with approximately 2,300 family farmers to raise the chickens. The farmers provide the houses, equipment, utilities and labor to grow the birds. Gold Kist provides the chicks, feed and technical assistance. When the chickens reach market weight, Gold Kist processes and markets them.

It is typically served with french fries.\n\nDaniel da Silva, a returned emigrant from France and Belgium, tried to adapt the croque-monsieur to the Portuguese taste when he moved to Porto.

A classic francesinha meal would include the sandwich, surrounded on a bed of chips doused in the famous , and complemented with a \"fino\", literally meaning thin or fine, which in this context refers to draught beer.\n\nLocals will have their favorite restaurant with the best Francesinha in town, typically arguing about the quality of the sauce (a secret recipe that varies by restaurant) and the quality of the meats.\n\nPorto and its surroundings is the traditional area of the francesinha, with many restaurants and cafés serving it.

In Lisbon, a number of bars and restaurants serve varied types of \"francesinha\", including variations served with green sauce.

It is commonly available in three sizes — bite sized (¾×1 in), miniature (nearly half the size of the bite-sized pieces), and original. Both smaller sizes are available in a frosted variety, which has one side coated with sugar and usually gelatin. Some manufacturers have produced \"filled\" versions of the bite-size cereal containing a raisin at the center, or apricot, blueberry, raspberry or cranberry filling.\n\nIn the United States, shredded wheat is most heavily advertised and marketed by Post Foods, which acquired the product in 1993 through its parent company, Kraft Foods, buying it from its long-time producer Nabisco. Kellogg's sells eight varieties of miniature, or bite-sized, shredded wheat cereal. Natural and organic manufacturer Barbara's Bakery makes an all-natural version of shredded wheat. In the United Kingdom, the Shredded Wheat brand is owned by Cereal Partners, a Nestlé/General Mills company, although there are many generic versions and variants by different names. It was first made in the United States in 1893, while UK production began in 1926.\n\nHenry Perky invented shredded wheat cereal in Denver, Colorado, in 1890. Inspired by his observation of a dyspeptic diner blending wheat with cream, he developed a method of processing wheat into strips that were formed into pillow-like biscuits. The wheat is first cooked in water until its moisture content reaches about 50%. It is then \"tempered\", allowing moisture to diffuse evenly into the grain. The grain then passes through a set of rollers with grooves in one side, yielding a web of shredded wheat strands. Many webs are stacked together, and this moist stack of strands is crimped at regular intervals to produce individual pieces of cereal with the strands attached at each end. These then go into an oven, where they are baked until their moisture content is reduced to 5%.\n\nPerky first sold his shredded wheat cereal to vegetarian restaurants in 1892, distributing it from a factory in Niagara Falls, New York. A health-oriented publication, \"The Chicago Vegetarian\", recommended the use of shredded wheat biscuits as soup croutons. At the same time, Perky leased cereal-manufacturing machines to bakers in Denver and Colorado Springs through his Cereal Machine Company and sold wheat processors. \n\nOne of his wheat-processor buyers, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, admired Perky's manufacturing process for his shredded wheat cereal. Kellogg declined to purchase Perky's patent on it, however, considering it too weak in taste, \"like eating a whisk broom.\" However, after co-founding the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company — later the Kellogg Company cereal manufacturer — with his brother Will Keith Kellogg in 1906, John Kellogg observed the success of Perky's product and offered to buy its patent from him, but at too low a price to pique Perky's interest.\n\nPremiering to the public at Chicago's World Columbian Exposition in 1893, shredded wheat cereal was then manufactured by The Natural Food Company in Niagara Falls, New York in 1901. It became the Shredded Wheat Company in 1904. It was bought by Nabisco (National Biscuit Company) in December 1928. \n\nUnited States production of Shredded Wheat moved to Naperville, Illinois in 1954, where it is still made. In 1993, Nabisco sold the brand to Kraft General Foods, but it was still under the Nabisco name until 1999, whereupon it was sold under the slogan \"Nabisco brought to you by Post.\"\n\nCanadian production has been at Niagara Falls, Ontario, since 1904 due to nearby hydro-electric power. United States production is also at Niagara Falls, Ontario. Until recently, United States production took place in Niagara Falls, New York, but that factory was closed when production was consolidated on the Canadian side of the border.\n\nIn 1920, Henry Perky's son, Scott Henry Perky, developed a round shredded wheat cereal, which he named Muffets. The Muffets Corporation was sold to the Quaker Oats Company in 1927. The cereal is still marketed in Canada as Muffets, but in the U.S. is now sold as Quaker Shredded Wheat.\n\nThe original company opened a factory in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire in 1926 at which time Welgar was its registered trade mark, which became part of Nabisco in 1928. The tall concrete cereal silos that form part of the factory are a local landmark and are listed structures. The first 18 storage units were completed in 1926 with a further 27 constructed in 1938, in both instances they were built by Peter Lind & Company of London who continue in business today. In 1988, Nabisco sold the UK site to Rank Hovis McDougall (who made own-label cereals for supermarkets), whose breakfast cereals division briefly became the \"Shredded Wheat Company\". In 1990, RHM sold the site to Cereal Partners. Now, all Shredded Wheat is made at Staverton, Wiltshire near Bath, Somerset, as the Welwyn Garden City site was shut down in 2008. Also, \"Bitesize\", \"Fruitful\" and \"Honey Nut\" Shredded Wheat are made in the UK.\n\nShredded Wheat has a particular place in UK popular culture due to a long-running television advertising campaign. The campaign in the 1970s featured Linda Hoyle, singing the lyrics:\n\nThe \"Three Shredded Wheat\" campaign, which came later, suggested that the cereal was so nourishing that it was impossible to eat three. Even a black hole was shown as exploding when the third biscuit was sucked into it. Phrases such as \"I bet you can't eat three\" and \"He must have eaten three\" were in common use as humorous remarks in the 1970s and 1980s, with celebrities such as Brian Clough, Peter Shilton, Richard Kiel and Ian Botham all 'unable' to eat three. A later UK poster advertisement for Carling Black Label showed a bowl with four Shredded Wheat and the caption \"I bet he drinks Carling Black Label.\"\n\nAfter Henry Perky died in 1908 and the patent on his Shredded Wheat biscuit expired in 1912, John Harvey Kellogg saw that as an opportunity for Kellogg's to sell its own version of the product. Kellogg obtained a patent on the biscuit in 1915, and Kellogg's Shredded Wheat was born. This provoked National Biscuit Company to sue Kellogg for trademark infringement, attempting to enjoin him from using \"Shredded Wheat\" as a trade name and from manufacturing the cereal in its pillow-shaped form. This series of litigations led to the United States Supreme Court case \"Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.\" in 1938. The Supreme Court ruled that \"shredded wheat\" was generic and not trademarkable; and that in any case, when the first patent for shredded wheat machinery expired in 1912, the right to apply the name \"shredded wheat\" to the product passed into the public domain along with that patent.\n\nShredded wheat consists entirely of whole wheat. Two biscuits (47 g.) contain 160 calories, 1 g. of fat and 6 g. of dietary fiber (12.8% by weight).\n\n\n"}

The dish is now a very important part of culture in Calgary and that part of Canada. A radio segment featuring ginger beef was aired on CBC Radio One programme \"The Main Ingredient\".\n\n"}

Perhaps the most obvious is an unusual cooking technique: the preparation of a wat begins with chopped onions slow cooked, without any fat or oil, in a dry skillet or pot until much of their moisture has been driven away. Fat (usually \"niter kibbeh\") is then added, often in quantities that might seem excessive by modern Western standards, and the onions and other aromatics are sautéed before the addition of other ingredients. This method causes the onions to break down and thicken the stew.\n\nWat is traditionally eaten with injera, a spongy flat bread made from the millet-like grain known as teff. There are many types of wats. The popular ones are doro wat and siga wat, (Ge'ez: ሥጋ \"śigā\") made with beef.\nDoro wat is one such stew, made from chicken and sometimes hard-boiled eggs; the ethnologist Donald Levine records that doro wat ( \"dōrō we̠t’\", \"derhō tsebhi\") is the most popular traditional food in Ethiopia, often eaten as part of a group who share a communal bowl and basket of injera. The chicken is cut into twelve pieces representing the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.\n\n"}

Its preparation is similar to that of ghee, but \"niter kibbeh\" is simmered with spices such as \"besobela\" (known as Ethiopian sacred basil), koseret, fenugreek, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cardamom, cinnamon, or nutmeg before straining, imparting a distinct, spicy aroma. The version using vegetable oil instead of butter is called \"yeqimem zeyet\".\n\n\n"}

There are many variations, but the traditional loco moco consists of white rice, topped with a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. Variations may include chili, bacon, ham, Spam, kalua pork, Portuguese sausage, teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, mahi-mahi, shrimp, oysters, and other meats. \"Loco Moco\" is also the name of a Hawaiian-based restaurant chain that serves Hawaiian rice bowl dishes.\n\nThe dish was reportedly created at the Lincoln Grill restaurants in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1949 by its proprietors, Richard Inouye and his wife Nancy, at the request of teenagers from the Lincoln Wreckers Sports club seeking something that differed from a sandwich, was inexpensive, and yet could be quickly prepared and served. They asked Nancy to put some rice in a bowl, a hamburger patty over the rice, and then top it with brown gravy. The egg came later. The teenagers named the dish Loco Moco after one of their members, George Okimoto, whose nickname was \"Crazy\". George Takahashi, who was studying Spanish at Hilo High School, suggested using Loco, which is Spanish for crazy. They tacked on \"moco\" which \"rhymed with loco and sounded good\". To Spanish-speakers, however, the name can sound very odd, given that they hear it as \"crazy snot\" (\"moco\" is Spanish for \"mucus\").\n\nThis dish was featured on the \"Taste of Hawai'i\" episode of \"Girl Meets Hawai'i\", a Travel Channel show hosted by Samantha Brown. The episode features the dish being served at the popular restaurant, Hawaiian Style Cafe, in Waimea together with the plate lunch, another Hawaiian specialty dish.\n\nThe loco moco was also featured on a Honolulu-based episode of the Travel Channel show \"Man v. Food\" (this episode aired in the show's second season). The host, Adam Richman, tried this dish at the Hukilau Café, located in nearby Laie. Richman also tried an off-the-menu loco moco at a San Francisco eatery called Namu Gaji on his 2014 show, \"Man Finds Food\". Then in 2018 on a different episode of the revived \"Man v. Food\", host Casey Webb tried a loaded version of the loco moco at Da Kitchen in Maui.\n\n\n"}
