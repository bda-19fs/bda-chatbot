{"id": "48233533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48233533", "title": "Dropbox Paper", "text": "Dropbox Paper\n\nDropbox Paper, or simply Paper, is a collaborative document-editing service developed by Dropbox. Originating from the company's acquisition of document collaboration company Hackpad in April 2014, Dropbox Paper was officially announced in October 2015, and launched in January 2017. It offers a web application, as well as mobile apps for Android and iOS.\n\nDropbox Paper was described in the official announcement post as \"a flexible workspace that brings people and ideas together. With Paper, teams can create, review, revise, manage, and organize—all in shared documents\".\n\nReception of Dropbox Paper has been mixed. Critics praised collaboration functionality, including content available immediately, the ability to mention specific collaborators, assign tasks, write comments, as well as editing attribution, and revision history. It received particular praise for its support for rich media from a variety of sources, with one reviewer noting that Paper's support for rich media exceeds the capabilities of most of its competitors. However, it was criticized for a lack of formatting options and editing features. While the user interface was liked for being minimal, reviewers cited the lack of a fixed formatting bar and missing features present in competitors' products as making Dropbox Paper seem like a \"light\" tool.\n\nDropbox acquired document collaboration company Hackpad in April 2014. A year later, Dropbox launched a Dropbox Notes note-taking product in beta testing phase. Dropbox Paper was officially announced on October 15, 2015, followed by an open beta and release of mobile Android and iOS apps in August 2016. Dropbox Paper was officially released on January 30, 2017.\n\nIn a comparison between Dropbox Paper and Evernote, \"PC World\"'s Michael Ansaldo wrote that \"With its emphasis on document creation, you might expect formatting to be front and center in Dropbox Paper. That's not the case.\" Ansaldo noted the lack of a \"fixed formatting toolbar as you'd find in Evernote or a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Instead, the text editor appears as a floating ribbon only when you highlight selected text.\" The only formatting options available for emphasis were bolding, strikethrough, bulleted and numbered lists, and H1 and H2 tags. Users can also add links, convert text to checklists, and add comments. Ansaldo wrote that \"Both Evernote and Dropbox Paper make it easy to add images to a document\", but also noted that \"Dropbox Paper doesn't support any image editing\". Paper supports rich media, and users can \"add rich content to your document just by pasting a link to the file. In addition to Dropbox, Paper supports media from a variety of popular services including YouTube, Spotify, Vimeo, SoundCloud, Facebook, and Google's productivity suite. Once the file appears, you can delete the link for a cleaner display.\" To start working with other people, Paper \"allows you to invite people via email from within a document\", with sharing options for who can view the link (anyone with the link or just the invited person), and action permissions (edit or only comment). Regarding collaboration, Ansaldo wrote that \"Creative collaboration is Paper’s marquee feature, and it provides a variety of ways to work effectively with others in real time\". Users can \"make any content immediately visible and accessible to a specific collaborator with \"@mentions\"\", and \"You can also use @mentions to create and assign task lists within a document.\" Paper also \"boasts essential collaboration tools including comments, editing attribution, and revision history.\"\n\nWriting for \"TechRadar\", John Brandon wrote that Dropbox Paper \"might be a 'light' tool for now without the extensive templates of Microsoft Office or the integration with other apps in the Zoho suite, but it does work well with the Dropbox storage service that's so popular with office workers these days.\"\n\nKyle Wiggers of \"Digital Trends\" wrote that Paper is \"all about minimizing distractions. Its interface is quite literally a big, blank canvas on which you tap out your agenda. You can organize notes by title and create to-do lists, but even basic formatting tools are obscured from view\", noting Paper's \"floating box above words and phrases highlighted by your cursor\". Wiggers stated that \"Paper is not a to-do organizer\", but that it's \"well suited to the purpose thanks to a bevy of labor-saving conveniences\", highlighting that Paper \"supports more media than most of its to-do and note-taking counterparts\". He praised the collaboration tools, writing that they \"are as extensive as you'd hope, and then some\", citing its invitation system with permission controls, lists of changes and revision history, comment and chat support, and \"perhaps best of all\", the ability to assign tasks with a \"@\" mention.\n\n\"Business Insider\"'s Alex Heath praised that \"Paper's interface is super clean and friendly to write in. You don't feel overwhelmed with formatting options\", but criticized the available features, writing that \"Google Docs is much more full-featured in the formatting department, so Paper has some catching up to do if it wants to be on par with the competition\". Writing for \"The Verge\", Casey Newton praised Paper's handling of rich media, complimenting it for being \"great\", and added that \"I imagine that creative types who work on teams will appreciate having rich media embedded in the documents they're working on rather than in a series of infinite tabs\".\n"}

Cake doughnuts originated in the United States circa 1829. Primary ingredients in the old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk and leavener. It is typically deep fried, may have a crunchier or crisper texture compared to other styles of cake doughnuts, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface. After being fried, it may be glazed, dusted with sugar, or served plain.\n\nCommercially prepared old-fashioned doughnuts may be prepared using a batter mix that is made with the addition of water. Such mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Some variations are prepared by various companies using unique ingredients, and some old-fashioned doughnuts are produced as doughnut holes.\n\nThe old-fashioned doughnut is a type of cake doughnut, and has been described as a \"subset\" of the cake doughnut. The cake doughnut itself originated in the United States circa 1829, when the increased availability of pearlash in the U.S., a type of leavener that preceded baking powder, lent to the increase of cake doughnut consumption. It is unclear when the old-fashioned doughnut itself was invented, but this very likely occurred \"after\" the cake doughnut was invented. Prior to circa 1829, doughnuts were typically the yeast-risen variety in the U.S. Circa the 1830s, the leaveners baking soda and baking powder began to be available to U.S. consumers, which is around the same time that cake doughnut recipes first appeared in U.S. cookbooks.\n\nPrimary ingredients in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, and may be deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.\n\nIt may be prepared with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The shape of the doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture to that of a buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.\n\nCommercially prepared old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, which may be prepared by simply adding cold water to the mix. Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.\n\nOne glazed old-fashioned doughnut contains approximately 420 calories, 21 grams of fat, 10 grams of saturated fat, 260 milligrams of sodium, 57 grams of carbohydrate, 34 grams of sugar, 4 grams of protein and less than one gram of dietary fiber.\n\nSeveral companies produce old-fashioned doughnuts that differ from standard preparations. Starbucks Corporation, based in Seattle, Washington, purveys an old-fashioned doughnut that is prepared using batter infused with chocolate. The U.S. company Trader Joe's purveys a mass-produced product named \"Old-Fashioned Doughnut O's\", which are miniature-sized old-fashioned doughnuts. In September 2015, Do-Rite Donuts in Chicago, Illinois created limited-edition custom doughnuts in collaboration with various celebrities, which included an old-fashioned doughnut with maple glaze garnished with candied Fresno chili peppers. The company Glazed and Infused in Chicago, Illinois serves customers the traditional glazed old-fashioned as well as a unique twist on the doughnut they call the lemon poppy seed old-fashioned doughnut. The doughnut at Glazed and Infused is covered with lemon-flavored glaze, and topped with poppy seeds and lemon zest.\n\nTop Pot Doughnuts in Seattle, Washington prepares both vanilla- and chocolate-based old-fashioned doughnuts. Each flavor can be dipped in glaze, raspberry glaze, chocolate icing, maple icing, or sugared pumpkin (in season). The restaurant Nopa in San Francisco, California has prepared a dessert using old-fashioned doughnut holes along with Asian pears, crème anglaise, pear butter and cardamaro liqueur. The doughnuts at Nopa are prepared using a sour cream base.\n\n\n"}

Similarly to a fougasse, an Occitan \"crespèu\" has many variations. This dish is also known as \"trouchia\" or \"omelette à la moissonneuse\". The latter name suggests that it originated as a dish traditionally prepared for field work and specifically for the harvest season.\n\nThe dish is usually baked and inverted. It comprises a minimum of three or four layers of different colored omelettes, often given by red tomatoes, orange carrots, green spinach or chard, and black olives. Peppers, with their variety of colors also allows for multicolored crespéou. Some preparations use sausage or sliced fish for a beige layer. In Nice, there is always an omelette made from chard ribs. Other vegetables can be used, such as zucchini, eggplant, onion, or basil.\n\nTraditionally a crespéou does not have to be accompanied by a wine. However, given the dish's extremely identified flavors, it can pair with a rosé wine certified to originate (AOC) from Côtes du Roussillon or Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n"}

In 2010 there was a fire at the distillery, which reportedly was only minutes from burning down stock reserves. Nobody was injured and production returned to normal soon after.\n\nWhen The English Whisky Company first started distilling in 2006, the Nelstrops brought in Ian Henderson (formally of Laphroaig), and a year later they hired David Fitt who has been distillery manager ever since.\n\nThe barley used in production is locally sourced and the water is supplied from an aquifer that runs directly beneath the distillery.

Around the youngest stars, they are the reservoirs of material out of which planets may form. Around mature stars, they indicate that planetesimal formation has taken place and around white dwarfs, they indicate that planetary material survived the whole of stellar evolution. Such a disc can manifest itself in various ways.\n\nAccording to the widely accepted model of star formation, sometimes referred to as the nebular hypothesis, a young star (protostar) is formed by the gravitational collapse of a pocket of matter within a giant molecular cloud. The infalling material possesses some amount of angular momentum, which results in the formation of a gaseous protoplanetary disc around the young, rotating star. The former is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust that continues to feed the central star. It may contain a few percent of the mass of the central star, mainly in the form of gas which is itself mainly hydrogen. The main accretion phase lasts a few million years, with accretion rates typically between 10 and 10 solar masses per year (rates for typical systems presented in Hartmann et al.).\n\nThe disc gradually cools in what is known as the T Tauri star stage. Within this disc, the formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ices can occur, and these can coagulate into planetesimals. If the disc is sufficiently massive, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the appearance of planetary embryos. The formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A sun-like star usually takes around 100 million years to form.\n\n\nThe infall of gas onto a binary system allows the formation of circumstellar and circumbinary discs. The formation of such a disc will occur for any binary system in which infalling gas contains some degree of angular momentum. A general progression of disc formation is observed with increasing levels of angular momentum:\nOnce a circumstellar disc has formed, spiral density waves are created within the circumstellar material via a differential torque due to the binary's gravity. The majority of these discs form axissymmetric to the binary plane, but it is possible for processes such as the Bardeen-Petterson effect, a misaligned dipole magnetic field and radiation pressure to produce a significant warp or tilt to an initially flat disc.\n\nStrong evidence of tilted discs is seen in the systems Her X-1, SMC X-1, and SS 433 (among others), where a periodic line-of-sight blockage of X-ray emissions is seen on the order of 50–200 days; much slower than the systems' binary orbit of ~1 day. The periodic blockage is believed to result from precession of a circumprimary or circumbinary disc, which normally occurs retrograde to the binary orbit as a result of the same differential torque which creates spiral density waves in an axissymmetric disc.\n\nEvidence of tilted circumbinary discs can be seen through warped geometry within circumstellar discs, precession of protostellar jets, and inclined orbits of circumplanetary objects (as seen in the eclipsing binary TY CrA). For discs orbiting a low secondary-to-primary mass ratio binary, a tilted circumbinary disc will undergo rigid precession with a period on the order of years. For discs around a binary with a mass ratio of one, differential torques will be strong enough to tear the interior of the disc apart into two or more separate, precessing discs.\n\n\nStages in circumstellar discs refer to the structure and the main composition of the disc at different times during its evolution. Stages include the phases when the disc is composed mainly of submicron-sized particles, the evolution of these particles into grains and larger objects, the agglomeration of larger objects into planetesimals, and the growth and orbital evolution of planetesimals into the planetary systems, like our Solar System or many other stars.\n\nMajor stages of evolution of circumstellar discs:\n\nMaterial dissipation is one of the processes responsible for circumstellar discs evolution. Together with information about the mass of the central star, observation of material dissipation at different stages of a circumstellar disc can be used to determine the timescales involved in its evolution. For example, observations of the dissipation process in transition discs (discs with large inner holes) estimate the average age of a circumstellar disc to be approximately 10 Myr.\n\nDissipation process and its duration in each stage is not well understood. Several mechanisms, with different predictions for discs' observed properties, have been proposed to explain dispersion in circumstellar discs. Mechanisms like decreasing dust opacity due to grain growth, photoevaporation of material by X-ray or UV photons from the central star (stellar wind), or the dynamical influence of a giant planet forming within the disc are some of the processes that have been proposed to explain dissipation.\n\nDissipation is a process that occurs continuously in circumstellar discs throughout the lifetime of the central star, and at the same time, for the same stage, is a process that is present in different parts of the disc. Dissipation can be divided in inner disc dissipation, mid-disc dissipation, and outer disc dissipation, depending on the part of the disc considered.\n\n\"Inner disc dissipation\" occurs at the inner part of the disc (< 0.05 – 0.1 AU). Since it is closest to the star, this region is also the hottest, thus material present there typically emits radiation in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Study of the radiation emitted by the very hot dust present in that part of the disc indicates that there is an empirical connection between accretion from a disc onto the star and ejections in an outflow.\n\n\"Mid-disc dissipatio\"n, occurs at the mid-disc region (1-5 AU) and is characterized for the presence of much more cooler material than in the inner part of the disc. Consequently, radiation emitted from this region has greater wavelength, indeed in the mid-infrared region, which makes it very difficult to detect and to predict the timescale of this region's dissipation. Studies made to determine the dissipation timescale in this region provide a wide range of values, predicting timescales from less than 10 up to 100 Myr.\n\n\"Outer disc dissipation\" occurs in regions between 50 – 100 AU, where temperatures are much lower and emitted radiation wavelength increases to the millimeter region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Mean dust masses for this region has been reported to be ~ 10 Solar masses. Studies of older debris discs (10 - 10 yr) suggest dust masses as low as 10 Solar masses, implying that diffusion in outer discs occurs on a very long timescale.\n\nAs mentioned, circumstellar discs are not equilibrium objects, but instead are constantly evolving. The evolution of the surface density formula_1 of the disc, which is the amount of mass per unit area so after the volume density at a particular location in the disc has been integrated over the vertical structure, is given by:\nformula_2\nwhere formula_3 is the radial location in the disc and formula_4 is the viscosity at location formula_3. This equation assumes axisymmetric symmetry in the disc, but is compatible with any vertical disc structure.\n\nViscosity in the disc, whether molecular, turbulent or other, transports angular momentum outwards in the disc and most of the mass inwards, eventually accreting onto the central object. The mass accretion onto the star formula_6 in terms of the disc viscosity formula_4 is expressed:\nformula_8\nwhere formula_9 is the inner radius.\n\n"}

The origin of the dish's name is unclear, and it has been suggested that its name may have been devised per the \"general branding of hot dogs as \"Texan\" on the East Coast.\"\n\nThe Texas Tommy is prepared by slicing a hot dog lengthwise to split it, cheese is placed within the slit, and the hot dog is then wrapped in bacon, secured with toothpicks, and cooked and served on a warmed or toasted bun. Cheddar cheese or American cheese may be used, and some versions are prepared using Cheez Whiz. In the 1950s, Velveeta was sometimes used in their preparation. Some versions are prepared by topping a hot dog with bacon and cheese. It may be cooked by barbecuing, grilling, broiling or deep frying.

Both systems are used to sort patients into categories at mass casualty incidents (MCIs). However, JumpSTART was designed specifically for triaging children in disaster settings. Though JumpSTART was developed for use in children from infancy to age 8, where age is not immediately obvious, it is used in any patient who appears to be a child (patients who appear to be young adults are triaged using START).\n\nJumpSTART was created in 1995 by Dr. Lou Romig, a pediatric emergency and disaster physician working at Miami Children's Hospital. After seeing the effects of Hurricane Andrew on the pediatric population, Dr. Romig became interested in pediatric disaster medicine and developed the JumpSTART tool. JumpSTART was modified in 2001.\n\nLike START, JumpSTART sorts patients into four categories:\n\nAs with START, the triage clinician begins by instructing everyone who can walk to move to a designated area for treatment. All patients who are able to do this are immediately tagged green (minor). These patients are then fully triaged by a clinician assigned to the green area (\"secondary triage\").\n\nIn the JumpStart system, infants are evaluated first in secondary triage, using the entire JumpStart algorithm. Other children who did not walk on their own, but were carried to the treatment area, are evaluated next.\n\nIf the patient is breathing, the clinician proceeds to step 3.\n\nAs with START, an airway maneuver is first attempted. If the child starts breathing on their own, they are triaged red (immediate).\nHowever, unlike START, patients who do not have a spontaneous return of respirations following an airway maneuver are not immediately triaged Black. First the clinician feels for a peripheral pulse. If the child is apneic with no peripheral pulse, they are triaged black (deceased/expectant).\n\nIf the child does have a palpable peripheral pulse, the clinician delivers five assisted ventilations. If the child remains apneic, they are triaged black. If the child has a return of spontaneous respirations, they are triaged red.\n\nThe child is triaged red if:\n\nTo be triaged yellow, the child must:\n\nAs of 2016, there have been no studies of JumpSTART's validity or reliability in actual mass-casualty settings, though JumpSTART's discriminant validity has been established. Within the medical literature, the existing studies of JumpSTART generally examine its use in training or simulated MCI settings.\n\nSeveral studies have found that medical providers easily learn the JumpSTART algorithm. For example, a study of prehospital and nursing personnel found that participants showed improvements in their ability to triage pediatric patients which were maintained over a 3-month period after training ceased. Similarly, a 2013 study found that medical residents in all postgraduate years easily learned the JumpSTART algorithm, with high inter-rater reliability in individual patient triage decisions. However, while reliability was high in patients with head injuries, it was low in ambulatory patients.\n\nIn a simulated pediatric mass casualty incident, JumpSTART was found to perform equally as well as SALT triage, which has been proposed as a new national standard for mass-casualty triage. However, JumpSTART was significantly faster than SALT, requiring eight seconds less per patient.\n\nHowever, a 2006 study by two physicians in a South African emergency department was critical of the JumpSTART system. The study examined how four different tools would have performed if used to triage pediatric patients that presented at the authors' emergency department. The authors compared the START and JumpSTART systems with two other pediatric triage tools: the Pediatric Triage Tape and Care Flight. The study reported:\nNone of the tools showed high sensitivity and specificity. ... [T]he JumpSTART and START scores had very low sensitivities, which meant that they failed to identify patients with serious injury, and would have missed the majority of seriously injured casualties in the models of major incidents.\n\nFurther study is needed to evaluate JumpSTART's validity and reliability, particularly in real-life patient settings.\n\n\n"}

However, it is quite hard to find in most parts of Europe (except for the Netherlands and UK) and also quite scarce in the Americas. Sweet soy sauce can be made from regular soy sauce. Regular soy sauce mixed with brown sugar, added with a trace of molasses, can serve as a substitute for sweet soy sauce.\n\n"}

Tenderness is a desirable quality, as tender meat is softer, easier to chew, and generally more palatable than harder meat. Consequently, tender cuts of meat typically command higher prices. The tenderness depends on a number of factors including the meat grain, the amount of connective tissue, and the amount of fat. Tenderness can be increased by a number of processing techniques, generally referred to as \"tenderizing\" or \"tenderization\".\n\nTenderness is perhaps the most important of all factors impacting meat eating quality, with others being flavor, juiciness, and succulence.\n\nTenderness is a quality complex to obtain and gauge, and it depends on a number of factors. On the basic level, these factors are meat grain, the amount and composition of connective tissue, and the amount of fat. In order to obtain a tender meat, there is a complex interplay between the animal's pasture, age, species, breed, protein intake, calcium status, stress before and at killing, and how the meat is treated after slaughter.\n\nMeat with the fat content deposited within the steak to create a \"marbled\" appearance has always been regarded as more tender than steaks where the fat is in a separate layer. Cooking causes melting of the fat, spreading it throughout the meat and increasing the tenderness of the final product.\n\nThe meat industry strives to produce meat with standardized and guaranteed tenderness, since these characteristics are sought for by the consumers. For that purpose a number of objective tests of tenderness have been developed, gauging meat resistance to shear force, most commonly used being \"Slice Shear Force\" test and \"Warner–Bratzler Shear Force\" test.\n\nTechniques for breaking down collagens in meat to make it more palatable and tender are referred to as \"tenderizing\" or \"tenderization\".\n\nThere are a number of ways to tenderize meat:\n\nEfforts have been made since at least 1970 to use explosives to tenderize meat and a company was founded to try to commercialize the process; as of 2011 it was not yet scalable.\n"}

The Polish noun ', or ', derives from the verb ', \"to parboil\", which refers to the distinctive technique of boiling the dough before baking. The adjective \" denotes anything coming from or related to the city of Kraków.\n\nAn ' is a ring-shaped baked product. It takes the form of an oval or, seldom, a circle with a hole in the middle.

The dough is divided into small portions, which are rolled out and cut into strips. The baker twists two or three strips into a spiral and then forms a ring by twisting them around his hand and presses it against the table.

On 22 January 1802, a decree was signed which stipulated that any baker had the right to bake ' when it was his turn to do so. The bakers authorised to bake ' were selected by the drawing of lots.

It also includes different kinds of sauces, usually chilli, garlic, and barbecue. Yoghurt, cheese, jalapeño peppers, tabbouleh, and hummus are common additions. The snack pack is traditionally served in a styrofoam container, and has been described as a staple takeaway dish of kebab shops in Australia. \n\nSome Australian restaurant menus refer to the dish as a \"snack pack\", \"snack box\", \"mixed plate\", \"kosher snack pack\" or \"HSP\", rather than as a \"halal snack pack\". The name of the dish was chosen by the Macquarie Dictionary as the \"People's Choice Word of the Year\" for 2016.\n\nThe halal snack pack originated in Australia as a culinary fusion of Middle-Eastern and European cuisines. According to some, snack packs date back at least to the 1980s. They have since become a quintessential Australian dish. However, variations or similar dishes exist in other countries; examples include \"doner meat and chips\" in the United Kingdom, \"\"kapsalon\"\" (\"barbershop\") in the Netherlands and Belgium, \"\"kebabtallrik\"\" (\"kebab plate\") in Sweden, \"gyro fries\" in the United States, and \"\"kebab ranskalaisilla\"\" ('kebab with French fries') in Finland. In Adelaide, South Australia, the dish is known as an \"AB\".\n\nIn late 2015, following the creation of the Facebook group, Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society, a subculture formed around the dish, it has been known to bring cultures together. This led to wide coverage of the dish in the media, as well as a notable reference by Senator Sam Dastyari in Australian Parliament during a debate about halal certification which is credited for much of the increase in attention paid to this dish.\n\nHealth concerns have been raised, even flippantly, about the refined carbohydrate content of halal snack packs. Excess refined carbohydrates can cause obesity and heart disease, as well as cerebrovascular, metabolic and renal conditions and complications.\n\nThe Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society is a Facebook group established in December 2015 that is dedicated to the halal snack pack. After its establishment, the group had 16,000 members sign on in its first month, and had almost 90,000 members in April 2016. The site encourages users to post reviews of halal snack packs they consume at various restaurants and kebab shops throughout Australia. The reviews sometimes include images of the dish, and are typically based upon the criteria of meat, chips and sauce quality, halal signage, packaging, price and the greeting diners receive, all of which are based upon a scale of 1–10. As of March 2016, the site refers to the \"standard\" price of a halal snack pack as AUD $10.\n\nOne of the goals of the group is to identify the potential for the world's best halal snack pack. The Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society also raises funds to support the Australian Relief Organisation, an organisation that assists underprivileged people to attain cataract surgery and assists orphanages with matters regarding water supplies.\n\nThe group has Muslim and non-Muslim members, who refer to one another as \"brothers and sisters\". Users on the site have been derided by other users at times for putting tomato sauce or salad on the dish, which the site discourages, referring to such users as \"haram dingos\". The site also states that such users who add tomato sauce or salad may be banned from the group.\n\nThe former Australian Labor Party Senator Sam Dastyari is a member of the Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society, and has publicly stated support for halal products and certification.\n\nSome kebab shops and restaurants have realised significantly increased sales after being reviewed on the group's Facebook page. For example, Metro One in the inner west area of Sydney had revenue increases of over 75% after being featured on the site as making one of the best halal snack packs in the city.\n\nIn July 2016, then Labor Senator Sam Dastyari invited the One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson out for a halal snack pack after she won a Senate seat in the 2016 Australian federal election. She rejected his proposal, saying, “It’s not happening, not interested in halal, thank you”. Hanson then elaborated, stating, “I’m not interested in it. I don’t believe in halal certification,” and went on to claim that “98 percent of Australians” opposed it. In response, several Australian restaurants created a Pauline Hanson-inspired halal snack pack. There has also been a GoFundMe campaign to turn Hanson's former fish and chip shop into a pop-up halal snack pack stand.\n\nThe \"AB\" dish in Adelaide is gyro meat topped with chips, tomato sauce, chilli sauce, barbecue sauce, and garlic sauce. The dish is sometimes served with alcoholic beverages. Two restaurants in Adelaide claim they invented the dish: the North Adelaide Burger Bar (also known as the Red & White) between 1969 and 1972, and the Blue & White in 1989. The \"AB\" may be placed at the centre of the table and shared. \n\n\n"}

A distinct feature of this cutlet is adding butter to minced meat which results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. The dish was created in the beginning of the 19th century in Russia and later adopted by French haute cuisine.\n\nThe general Russian term \"kotleta\" (cutlet) may denote both a thin slice of meat and a cutlet-shaped patty made of ground meat. The latter meaning is much more common today. Both meanings are also used in haute cuisine. Escoffier notes that minced chicken cutlets differ from chicken croquettes only in shape.\n\nA popular historical myth related the creation of this dish to prince Dmitry Pozharsky. In reality, the dish name is associated with another Pozharsky family, the owners of an inn and a restaurant in Torzhok. Located between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the small town of Torzhok was a common place for coach stops where the travellers took a break and changed horses. Alexander Pushkin recommended in 1826 in a letter to a friend to \"dine at Pozharsky in Torzhok, try fried cutlets and set out with a light mood\".\nAt that time the inn was owned by Yevdokim Pozharsky, a coachman. The preparation method is usually attributed to Darya Pozharskaya, the daughter of Yevdokim. Several legends appeared about the origin of this dish. According to one legend, the recipe was given to the Pozharskys by a poor French traveller as payment for the accommodation.\n\nInitially the patties were made of ground beef or veal. The chicken version appeared probably in 1830-1840s when Darya Pozharskaya inherited the inn after her father's death. There are numerous references by the contemporaries mentioning both veal cutlets Pozharsky and their versions made of minced chicken and coated with breadcrumbs. The cutlets are mentioned in particular by Leitch Ritchie (1836), Victor d’Arlincourt (1843) and Théophile Gautier (1875). The first complete recipes of Pozharsky cutlets were published in a Russian cookbook in 1853; the cookbook included a recipe for chicken cutlets and one for fish cutlets. Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva notes in \"The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art\" (1899–1916) that the same cutlets can also be made from game (grouse, partridge etc.).\nTsar Nicolas I was greatly impressed by the taste of Pozharsky cutlets, and Darya Pozharskaya was invited several times to the imperial court to cook this dish for the Tsar's family.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the dish was adopted by French chefs, and various cutlet-shaped patties made of minced meat (veal, chicken, grouse, hare) or fish (salmon) mixed with butter were named \"Pojarski\" in classical French cookbooks.\n\nThe chicken cutlet Pozharsky was later included in the Soviet \"Book of Tasty and Healthy Food\" and remained a common restaurant dish in the Soviet times.\n\nVarious authors describe somewhat different procedures of preparing these cutlets. Alexandrova-Ignatieva recommends the use of butter in its solid form for mixing with ground chicken meat. In the recipe included in \"The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food\", white bread soaked in milk and heated butter are added to ground chicken meat. In general, many authors suggest mixing white bread soaked in milk with the ground meat. In some recipes heavy cream is added. Some chefs replace butter completely by heavy cream.\n\nFor presentation, the meat can be formed on a veal chop bone (for veal cutlets) or a chicken wing bone (for chicken cutlets).\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, industrially produced, semi-processed ground meat cutlets were introduced in the USSR. Colloquially known as Mikoyan cutlets (named after Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled American burgers. Some varieties bore names of well known Russian restaurant dishes but they had little in common with the original dishes. In particular, a variety of a pork patty was called \"Pozharsky cutlet\".\n"}
