The Hopewell were located around the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers during the Middle Woodland Period, and the Hopewell Interaction Sphere spanned from the Gulf of Mexico to Ontario, Canada.\n\nThis pottery was used in a variety of ways: from storage and cooking to holding offerings during burial ceremonies. Ceremonial pottery was noticeably more delicate and elaborate than pottery for domestic use.\n\nAlthough there are many techniques and methods of pottery production, the method most likely used in the Hopewell culture was the coiled method. After making the initial form of the vessel a paddle and anvil would then be used to further shape and smooth the pot. The final two steps are decoration and firing.\n\nBefore firing, Hopewell pottery was often incised, stamped, or zone-stamped, in which different \"zones\" of the pot were delineating by incised, then stamped, leaving the surrounding areas smooth for contrast. \"Hopewell ware\" is characterized by crosshatching, bands with cambered rims, and highly stylized bird motifs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3022453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3022453", "title": "Nafs", "text": "Nafs\n\nNafs () is an Arabic word occurring in the Quran, literally meaning \"self\", and has been translated as \"psyche\", \"ego\" or \"soul\". In the Quran, the word is used in both the individualistic (verse 2:48) and collective sense (verse 4:1), indicating that although humanity is united in possessing the positive qualities of a \"nafs\", they are individually responsible for exercising the agencies of the \"free will\" that it provides them.\nMuch of the popular literature on \"nafs\", however, is focused on the Sufi conceptions of the term. According to the Sufi philosophies, the \"nafs\" in its unrefined state is \"the ego\", which they consider to be the lowest dimension of a person's inward existence — his animal and Satanic nature. \"Nafs\" is an important concept in the Islamic tradition, especially within Sufism and the discipline of gnosis (\"irfan\") in Shia Islam.\n\nThe triliteral root \"nūn fā sīn\" (ن ف س) occurs 298 times in the Quran, in four derived forms:\n\n\nThe noun \"nafs\" has important instances in the Quran such as the following: \"O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves...\" The major theme of the word \"nafs\" as used in the Quran is to instill a sense of individual responsibility through a strong emphasis on the choices made by the individual (as in 5:105), while at the same time reminding humanity of its common origins (verse 4:1).\n\nThe Quran affords much importance to the \"nafs\" of an individual, highlighting the agency of free will and intelligence, without which neither responsibility nor accountability can exist. The Quran does not attribute to the \"nafs\" any inherent properties of good or evil, but instead conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' through its thoughts and actions. The Quranic conception of the \"nafs\" therefore has an extremely modernistic undertone, much like Nietzsche's conception of \"Übermensch\" or 'Superman', as suggested by Muhammad Iqbal, a prominent Muslim scholar and philosopher, who went as far as to accuse Nietzsche of borrowing the term from Islamic thought. Iqbal stated: \"It is probable that Nietzsche borrowed it (Übermensch) from the literature of Islam or of the East and degraded it by his materialism.\"\n\nThere are three principal stages of \"nafs\" in Sufistic Wisdom, also mentioned in different verses of the Quran. The Sufis call them \"stages\" in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the \"nafs\".\nIn its primitive stage the \"nafs\" incites us to commit evil: this is the \"nafs\" as the lower self, the base instincts. In the eponymous Sura of the Quran, Yusuf says \"Yet I claim not that my \"nafs\" was innocent: Verily the \"nafs\" incites to evil.\"\nIslam emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting \"nafs\" in Quran as well as in hadith. One tradition holds that Muhammad said after returning from a war, \"We now return from the small struggle (Jihad Asghar) to the big struggle (Jihad Akbar)\". His companions asked, \"O prophet of God, what is the big struggle?\" He replied, \"The struggle against \"nafs\".\"\n\nThis stage is generally divided into the levels \"al nafs al-hayawaniyya\" und \"al nafs al-iblissiyya\". \"Al nafs al-hayawaniyya\" (\"the animal state\") describes the self, which runs after material possessesion, sensual desires and animalistic pleasures. \"Al nafs al-iblissiyya\" is even lower than the animal state, because the self seeks to replace God in the love for itself.\n\nThe Quran enjoins the faithful \"to hinder the \"nafs\" from lust\", and another traditional narration warns that \"the worst enemy you have is [the \"nafs\"] between your sides.\" Rumi warns of the \"nafs\" in its guise of religious hypocrisy, saying \"the \"nafs\" has a rosary and a Koran in its right hand, and a scimitar and dagger in the sleeve.\"\n\nAnimal imagery is often used to describe the \"nafs\". A popular image is a donkey or unruly horse that must be trained and broken so that eventually it will bear its rider to the goal. Rumi compares the \"nafs\" to a camel that the hero Majnun, representing the intellect ('Aql), strains to turn in the direction of the dwelling-place of his beloved.\n\nIn Sura al-Qiyama the Quran mentions \"the self-accusing \"nafs\"\". This is the stage where \"the conscience is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one’s ego. One repents and asks for forgiveness.\" Here the \"nafs\" is inspired by your heart, sees the results of your actions, agrees with your brain, sees your weaknesses, and aspires to perfection.\n\nIn Sura al-Fajr the Quran mentions \"the \"nafs\" at peace\". This is the ideal stage of ego for Muslims. On this level one is firm in one’s faith and leaves bad manners behind. The soul becomes tranquil, at peace. At this stage, followers of Sufism have relieved themselves of all materialism and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God.\n\nIn addition to the three principal stages, another four are sometimes cited:\n\nThis stage comes between the 2nd and 3rd principal stages. It is the stage of action. On this level \"one becomes more firm in listening to one’s conscience, but is not yet surrendered.\" Once you have seen your weaknesses and have set your targets, this ego inspires you to do good deeds and to be on the plus side. The Sufis say that it is important that whenever you think of good, you must immediately act upon it. Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib lays down three rules:\n\nAccording to the Quran, charity should be given both secretly and openly. In Muhammad Asad's translation of the Quran, 14:31 reads: \"[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending.\"\n\nThis stage comes after the thirdrd principal stage. On this level \"one is pleased with whatever comes from Allah and doesn’t live in the past or future, but in the moment.\" \"One thinks always: ‘Ilahi Anta Maqsudi wa ridhaka matlubi’. One always sees oneself as weak and in need of Allah.\"\n\nOn this level the two Ruhs in man \"have made peace\". \"One is soft and tolerant with people and has good Akhlaq (Arabic: أخلاق), good manners.\"\n\nOn this level \"one is dressed in the attributes of the Insan Kamil, the perfected man, who is completely surrendered and inspired by Allah.\" One is \"in full agreement with the Will of Allah\".\n\nTherefore, the full sequence of the seven stages of the development of the \"nafs\" is as follows:\n\n\nDervishes from the Jerrahi school of Sufism are encouraged to study a text describing these stages of \"nafs\" as a nested series of cities.\n\nIn its primitive state the \"nafs\" has seven characteristics that must be overcome:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3022477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3022477", "title": "Rūḥ", "text": "Rūḥ\n\nIn Islam, especially Sufism, rūḥ (; plural \"arwah\") is a person's immortal, essential self — pneuma, i.e. the \"spirit\" or \"soul\". The Quran itself does not describe \"rūḥ\" as the immortal self. Nevertheless, in some contexts, it animates inanimate matter. Further, it appears to be a metaphorical being, such as an angel. In one instance, \"rūḥ\" refers to Jesus.Further, the Quran refers to \"rūḥ\" as \"Ruh al-qudus\" (, \"the holy spirit\" or \"spirit of holiness\") and \"al-ruh al-amin\" (\"the faithful/trustworthy spirit\"). \n\nOutside the Quran, \"rūḥ\" may also refer to a spirit that roams the earth; a ghost.\n\nAmong the al-Laṭaʾif as-sitta () it is the third purity.\n\nRuh al-qudus (, \"the holy spirit\" or \"spirit of holiness\"), al-ruh al-amin (\"the faithful/trustworthy spirit\"), and \"ruh\" (spirit) are Quranic expressions that describe a source or means of prophetic revelations, commonly identified with the angel Gabriel. Quranic commentators disagreed in their identification of Gabriel with various uses of the word \"ruh\".\n\nThe Arabic phrase \"\"al-Qudus\"\" () translates into English as \"the Holy One\" or \"the Exalted One\". \"\"Al-Quddūs\"\" is one of the 99 Names of God in Islam.\nThe phrase \"ruh al-qudus\", commonly translated as the \"holy spirit\" or the \"spirit of holiness\", occurs four times in the Quran, in sura 2 (Al-Baqara) ayat 87, sura 2 (Al-Baqara) ayat 253, sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida) ayat 110, and sura 16 (An-Nahl) ayat 102. In three instances, it is described as the means by which God \"strengthened\" Jesus, and in the fourth it is identified as the one brought down God's truth to his prophet. Muslim commentators commonly connected this expression with the \"faithful/trustworthy sprit\" (\"al-ruh al-amin\") who is said to have brought down the Quran in verse , and identified with Gabriel. Other Muslim commentators viewed it as identical with the created spirit described in other Quranic verses as the means by which God brought Adam to life (e.g., ), made Mary conceive Jesus and inspired angels and prophets (e.g., ). The spirit who together with \"the angels\" descends and ascends to God (, , ) was also identified with Gabriel in Quranic commentaries. Thus, the figure of Gabriel became a focus of theological reflection on the content of revelation and the nature of cognition itself, with distinctions articulated between reason, prophetic revelation, and mystical knowledge.\n\nIn Shia Islam \"ruh\" is described as \"a creature (\"khalq\") of God larger than Gabriel or Michael\", who was sent to inform and guide Muhammad and is now with the Imams. In some Shia traditions, \"ruh al-qudus\" (spirit of holiness) is one of the five spirits possessed by the Imam. Unlike the other four spirits, it is always vigilant and available to inform the Imam on any issue. There is disagreement on whether \"ruh\" is an angel.\n\nThe term \"Ruh al-Qudus\" also applies to the Archangel Gabriel (referred to as \"Jibral\", \"Jibrīl\", \"Jibrael\", \"'Džibril\", \"Jabrilæ\", \"Cebrail\" or \"Jibrail\" (جبريل, جبرائيل, , , or ), who is related as the Angel of revelation and was assigned by God to reveal the Qur'an to the prophet Muhammad and who delivered the Annunciation to Mary.\n\nIn the two suras in which the Qur'an refers to the angel Gabriel, it does so by name. However, some hadith and parts of the Qur'an may arguably lend support to the alternative view.\n\nIt appears to be indicated by the Quran in sura \"Maryam\" ayat 16–21, that it was the angel Gabriel who gave to Mary the tidings that she was to have a son as a virgin:\n\nShe chose to seclude herself (from her people); then we sent to her Our Spirit, and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: \"Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (God) from you, if you do fear God.\" (The man) said: \"I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.\" She said: \"How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?\" He said: \"So (it will be), your Lord said: 'That is easy for me (God): And (we wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from us (God), and it is a matter (already) decreed (by God).' \" \nIt is narrated in hadith that the angel Gabriel accompanied Muhammad during the Mi'raj, an ascension to the heavens in which Muhammad is said to have met other messengers of God and was instructed about the manner of Islamic prayer (sujud). (Bukhari .) It is also held by Muslims that the angel Gabriel descends to Earth on the night of Laylat al-Qadr (\"The Night of Fate\"), a night in the last ten days of the holy month of Ramadan (Islamic calendar) which is said to be the night on which the Qur'an was first revealed.\n\nGod is believed to endow humans with \"rūḥ\" and \"nafs\" (, psyche, i.e. ego or \"(inner) soul\"). The rūḥ \"drives\" the nafs, which comprises temporal desires and sensory perceptions. The nafs can assume control of the body if the rūḥ surrenders to bodily urges. The nafs is subject to bodily desire, whereas the rūḥ is a person's immaterial essence, beyond the emotions and instincts shared by humans and other animals; rūḥ makes the body alive. Some arwah (pl. spirits) dwell in the seventh heaven. Unlike the angels, they are supposed to eat and drink. An angel called \"Ar-Rūḥ\" (the spirit) is responsible for them.\n\nTo attend Tajalli ar-rūḥ, the Salik needs to achieve the following 13.\n\n\n"}

Kashk is made from drained yogurt (in particular, drained qatiq) or drained sour milk by forming it and letting it dry. It can be made in a variety of forms, including rolled into balls, sliced into strips, and formed into chunks.\n\nThere are three main kinds of food products with this name: foods based on curdled milk products like yogurt or cheese; foods based on barley broth, bread, or flour; and foods based on cereals combined with curdled milk.\n\nKashk is a sort of gruel of fresh cheese. It is eaten plain, but can be used other ways. For example, it can be dissolved in water and eaten like yogurt. In western parts of Azerbaijan, it's customary to dissolve qurut in water by hand and use the sauce with \"xəngəl\", the traditional Azerbaijani lasagna-type dish. Qurut dissolved in water is a primary ingredient of \"qurutob,\" a traditional Persian dish in Tajik, Afghan and Iranian cuisine and thought of by some as the national dish of Tajikistan. One of the main dishes in Afghanistan is kichree qurut, made with mung beans, rice and qurut dissolved in water. It is sometimes salted, and in Inner Mongolia can be flavoured and distributed as candy.\n\nChortan is mentioned in the Armenian epic poem, \"Sasuntsi Davit\", as an oral tradition dating from 8th-century, which was first put into written form in 1873. \"Chor\" means dry in the Armenian language. Kashk is also mentioned in the 10th-century Persian book of poetry \"Shahnameh\". \"Khoshk\" (Persian : خشک meaning \"dry\") which indicates that the kashk or kishk is prepared through a drying [خشکیدن] process. Qurut or kurut means dried in Turkic languages.\n\nIn modern Iran, kashk is a thick whitish liquid similar to whey or sour cream, used in traditional Persian and Kurdish cuisine, like ash reshteh, kashk e badamjan, kale joush. It is available as a liquid or in a dried form, which needs to be soaked and softened before it can be used in cooking. Kashk was traditionally produced from the leftovers of cheese-making (more specifically, the milk used to make it). The procedure is, subtracting butter from milk, the remainder is doogh which can be used as the base for kashk. The water is subtracted from this whitish beverage and what remains is kashk which can be dried. Iranian kashk has made an appearance in US markets in the past half-century by several Iranian grocers starting with Kashk Hendessi.\n\nIn Turkey, kashk is a dried yoghurt product also known as \"keş peyniri\", \"kurut\", \"taş yoğurt\", \"kuru yoğurt\", or \"katık keşi\". Its contents and production vary by region. In western and northern Turkey, especially in Bolu, the product is categorized as a cheese owing to its shape and white color. In eastern Turkey, especially Erzincan, Erzurum, and Kars, kurut is produced from skimmed yoghurt made from the whey left over from production of butter by the \"yayık\" method, and then crushed or rolled. In parts of southeastern Turkey with a significant Kurdish population, it is called \"keşk\". All versions of this dairy product are salty. It is used as an ingredient in soups, keşkek, erişte, etc.\n\nThere is also a closely related dried food product called tarhana which is based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk. It is very similar to \"kishk\" of the Levantine cuisine described below.\n\nIn Lebanon, Palestine, Arabian Peninsula and Syria, \"kishk\" is a powdery cereal of burghul (cracked wheat) fermented with milk and laban (yogurt), usually from goat milk. It is easily stored and is valuable to the winter diet of isolated villagers or country people. Kishk is prepared in early autumn following the preparation of burghul. Milk, laban and burghul are mixed well together and allowed to ferment for nine days. Each morning the mixture is thoroughly kneaded with the hands. When fermentation is complete the kishk is spread on a clean cloth to dry. Finally it is rubbed well between the hands until it is reduced to a powder and then stored in a dry place. In Jordan a dried yogurt similar to kashk called jameed is commonly used. Elsewhere in the Levant, similar products are referred to as drained labneh (\"labneh malboudeh\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3025935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3025935", "title": "Antidoron", "text": "Antidoron\n\nThe antidoron (, \"\") is ordinary leavened bread which is blessed but not consecrated and distributed in Eastern Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches that use the Byzantine Rite. It comes from the remains of the loaves of bread (prosphora) from which portions are cut for consecration as the Eucharist during the Divine Liturgy. The word Ἀντίδωρον means \"instead of gifts\".\n\nIn the Orthodox Church, blessed antidoron is distributed after every Divine Liturgy. During the Prothesis (Liturgy of Preparation, at which the wine and bread are prepared on the Table of Oblation), the priest will bless each prosphoron as he takes it up to remove particles and place them on the diskos (paten). The remainder of the prosphora is cut into fragments and kept aside in a bowl or salver. In some jurisdictions it is the custom at the end of the Anaphora for the altar server to hand the bowl of antidoron to the priest who will make the Sign of the Cross with it over the chalice and diskos during the hymn, \"It is Truly Meet\".\n\nSince the Eucharist is essentially a meal, in the Russian Orthodox tradition some of the antidoron is placed on a tray together with ordinary wine and is consumed by the communicants immediately after they receive Holy Communion.\n\nAt the conclusion of the liturgy, the antidoron is distributed to the faithful as they come up to kiss the blessing cross. Antidoron is not considered a sacrament and is explicitly not consecrated during the Eucharist. Therefore, non-Orthodox present at the liturgy, who are not admitted to partake of the consecrated bread and wine, are often encouraged to receive the antidoron as an expression of Christian fellowship and love.\n\nBecause the antidoron is blessed, some jurisdictions and customs mandate that it be consumed only after fasting. The canonical regulations of the Eastern Orthodox Church state that the antidoron should be consumed before leaving the church, and that it should not be distributed to unbelievers or to persons undergoing penance before absolution, but variances are allowed. For instance, it is the custom in many Orthodox parishes to distribute the antidoron to visitors and catechumens as a sign of fellowship, or to bring a few pieces home to a relative who could not attend the liturgy.\n\nOn Bright Saturday, in place of (or in addition to) the normal antidoron, the Paschal Artos is cut up and distributed at the end of the liturgy.\n\nIn the Greek Catholic (Byzantine) churches of Austria and Hungary, the antidoron is presently given only on rare occasions during the year, chiefly on the Bright Saturday (Saturday in Easter week); while among the Greek (Roman) Catholics of Italy and Sicily it is usually given only on Holy Thursday, the Feast of the Assumption, that of Saint Nicolas of Myra, and at certain week-day services in Lent; although according to some local customs it is given on other days. In other Eastern Catholic churches of the Byzantine Rite it is distributed as in the Orthodox churches.\n\nThe earliest historical references to this custom are in fact found in the Western Church. It is mentioned in the 118th letter of St. Augustine to Januarius (now known as the 54th letter in the new order), and in the canons of a local council in Gaul in the seventh century. Originally it was a substitute, or solatium, for such of the faithful as were not properly prepared to receive Holy Communion or were unable to get to the eucharistic sacrifice. If they could not partake of the sacrament, for instance because of not having fulfilled the obligatory fast or for being in a state of mortal sin, they had the consolation of partaking of the non-consecrated liturgical bread which had been blessed and from which the portions for the consecration had been taken.\n\nIn the Eastern Church, mention of the antidoron began to appear in about the ninth and tenth centuries. Germanus of Constantinople mentions it in his treatise \"The Explanation of the Liturgy\". Subsequent to him, many writers of the Eastern Church (Balsamon, Colina, Pachemeros) have written on the custom of giving the antidoron.\n\nWhile the practice of blessing and distributing antidoron still continues in the East, the practice was largely abandoned by the Western Church, and now only survives in the Roman Rite in the \"\" given in French churches and cathedrals after High Mass, as well as in certain churches of Québec, and occasionally in Italy, on certain feasts (e.g. of Saint Hubert, Saint Anthony of Padua). A similar custom also survives among the Syrian Christians (Christians of Saint Thomas) of the Malabar coast in India.\n\n"}

{"id": "3031996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3031996", "title": "Wine fault", "text": "Wine fault\n\nA wine fault or defect is an unpleasant characteristic of a wine often resulting from poor winemaking practices or storage conditions, and leading to wine spoilage. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on perception, these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure the flavors and aromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable.\n\nThere are many causes for the perception in wine faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended maceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine, the use of dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging and the use of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage of the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.\n\nIn wine tasting, there is a big distinction made between what is considered a \"flaw\" and a \"fault\". Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity, \"Brettanomyces\" or \"Brett aromas\" and diacetyl or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and \"Brettanomyces\" can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.\n\nThe vast majority of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that are not meant to be sparkling can be a sign of refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with volatile acidity that can make a wine seem out of balance.\n\nThe oxidation of wine is perhaps the most common of wine faults, as the presence of oxygen and a catalyst are the only requirements for the process to occur. \nOxidation can occur throughout the winemaking process, and even after the wine has been bottled. Anthocyanins, catechins, epicatechins and other phenols present in wine are those most easily oxidised, which leads to a loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as \"flattening\". In most cases compounds such as sulfur dioxide or erythorbic acid are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect. Apart from phenolic oxidation, the ethanol present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.\n\nAcetaldehyde is an intermediate product of yeast fermentation; however, it is more commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde production is also associated with the presence of surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a \"sherry\" type character to the wine which can also be described as \"green apple\", \"sour\" and \"metallic\". Acetaldehyde intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.\n\nAcetic acid in wine, often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or \"vinegar taint\", can be contributed by many wine spoilage yeasts and bacteria. This can be from either a by-product of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera \"Acetobacter\" and \"Gluconobacter\" produce high levels of acetic acid. The sensory threshold for acetic acid in wine is >700 mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.\n\nThere are different opinions as to what level of volatile acidity is appropriate for higher quality wine. Although too high a concentration is sure to leave an undesirable, 'vinegar' tasting wine, some wine's acetic acid levels are developed to create a more 'complex', desirable taste. The renowned 1947 Cheval Blanc is widely recognized to contain high levels of volatile acidity.\n\nEthyl acetate is formed in wine by the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels are more likely to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by wine spoilage yeasts, particularly \"Pichia anomala\" or \"Kloeckera apiculata\". High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.\n\nSulfur is used as an additive throughout the winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as antimicrobial agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to flavour and aroma taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a common wine additive, used for its antioxidant and preservative properties. When its use is not managed well it can be overadded, with its perception in wine reminiscent of \"matchsticks\", \"burnt rubber\", or \"mothballs\". Wines such as these are often termed \"sulfitic\".\n\nHydrogen sulfide (HS) is generally thought to be a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in nitrogen limited environments. It is formed when yeast ferments via the sulfate reduction pathway. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with diammonium phosphate (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent HS formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 μg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct \"rotten egg\" aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and disulfides.\n\nMercaptans (thiols) are produced in wine by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the lees. This can be prevented by racking the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 µg/L, with levels above causing \"onion\", \"rubber\", and \"skunk\" type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl mercaptan.\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS) is naturally present in most wines, probably from the breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids. Like ethyl acetate, levels of DMS below the sensory threshold can have a positive effect on flavour, contributing to \"fruityness\", \"fullness\", and \"complexity\". Levels above the sensory threshold of >30 µg/L in white wines and >50 µg/L for red wines, give the wine characteristics of \"cooked cabbage\", \"canned corn\", \"asparagus\" or \"truffles\".\n\nCork taint is a wine fault mostly attributed to the compound 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), although other compounds such as guaiacol, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are also thought to be involved. TCA most likely originates as a metabolite of mould growth on chlorine-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes \"earthy\", \"mouldy\", and \"musty\" aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as \"\"corked\"\". As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly attributed to it.\n\nHeat damaged wines are often casually referred to as \"cooked\", which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13 °C (55 °F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible along the length of the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.\n\nEven if the temperatures do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage bottled wine through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the bottle and will act to \"pump\" air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.\n\nReputedly, heat damage is the most widespread and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.\n\nLightstruck wines are those that have had excessive exposure to ultraviolet light, particularly in the range 325 to 450 nm. Very delicate wines, such as Champagnes, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a \"wet cardboard\" or \"wet wool\" type flavour and aroma. Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike is thought to be caused by sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. In France lightstrike is known as \"\"goût de lumière\"\", which translates to \"a taste of light\". The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.\n\nSome insects present in the grapes at harvest inevitably end up in the press and for the most part are inoffensive. Others, notably the Asian lady beetle, release unpleasant smelling nitrogen heterocycles as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's odor and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compound is isopropyl methoxy pyrazine - this molecule is perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter and herbal, green bell pepper, or urine like. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so pyrazine taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.\n\nThe yeast \"Brettanomyces\" produces an array of metabolites when growing in wine, some of which are volatile phenolic compounds. Together these compounds are often referred to as \"phenolic taint\", \"\"Brettanomyces character\"\", or simply \"Brett\". The main constituents are listed below, with their sensory threshold and common sensory descriptors:\n\nGeosmin is a compound with a very distinct \"earthy\", \"musty\", \"beetroot\", even \"turnip\" flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous actinomycetes such as \"Streptomyces\", and moulds such as \"Botrytis cinerea\" and \"Penicillium expansum\", on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and has been found in recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.\n\nLactic acid bacteria have a useful role in winemaking converting malic acid to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria may still be present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming turbid, \"swampy\", and slightly effervescent or \"spritzy\". This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.\n\nBitterness taint or \"amertume\" is rather uncommon and is produced by certain strains of bacteria from the genera \"Pediococcus\", \"Lactobacillus\", and \"Oenococcus\". It begins by the degradation of glycerol, a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a dehydratase enzyme to \"3-hydroxypropionaldehyde\". During ageing this is further dehydrated to acrolein which reacts with the anthocyanins and other phenols present within the wine to form the taint. As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.\n\nDiacetyl in wine is produced by lactic acid bacteria, mainly \"Oenococcus oeni\". In low levels it can impart positive \"nutty\" or \"caramel\" characters, however at levels above 5 mg/L it creates an intense \"buttery\" or \"butterscotch\" flavour, where it is perceived as a flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the malic acid has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.\n\nGeranium taint, as the name suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine reminiscent of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is \"2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene\", which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1 ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of potassium sorbate by lactic acid bacteria. Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally kept to a minimum due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of sorbic acid to the alcohol \"sorbinol\". The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to \"3,5-hexadiene-2-ol\", which is then esterified with ethanol to form \"2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene\". As ethanol is necessary for the conversion, the geranium taint is not usually found in must.\n\nMannitol is a sugar alcohol, and in wine it is produced by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, such as \"Lactobacillus brevis\", by the reduction of fructose. Its perception is often complicated as it generally exists in wine alongside other faults, but it is usually described as viscous, ester-like combined with a sweet and irritating finish. Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation with a high level of residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.\n\nRopiness is manifested as an increase in viscosity and a \"slimey\" or \"fatty\" mouthfeel of a wine. In France the fault is known as \"\"graisse\"\", which translates to \"fat\". The problem stems from the production of dextrins and polysaccharides by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera \"Leuconostoc\" and \"Pediococcus\".\n\nMousiness is a wine fault most often attributed to \"Brettanomyces\" but can also originate from the lactic acid bacteria \"Lactobacillus brevis\", \"Lactobacillus fermentum\", and \"Lactobacillus hilgardii,\" and hence can occur in malolactic fermentation. The compounds responsible are lysine derivatives, mainly;\nThe taints are not volatile at the pH of wine, and therefore not obvious as an aroma. However, when mixed with the slightly basic pH of saliva they can become very apparent on the palate, especially at the back of the mouth, as \"mouse cage\" or \"mouse urine\".\n\nRefermentation, sometimes called secondary fermentation, is caused by yeasts refermenting the residual sugar present within bottled wine. It occurs when sweet wines are bottled in non-sterile conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", but has also been attributed to \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" and \"Zygosaccharomyces bailii\". The main issues associated with the fault include turbidity (from yeast biomass production), excess ethanol production (may violate labelling laws), slight carbonation, and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as dimethyl dicarbonate. The Portuguese wine style known as \"vinhos verdes\" used to rely on this secondary fermentation in bottle to impart a slight spritziness to the wine, but now usually uses artificial carbonation.\n\nOrganisms responsible for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, the most common of these being \"Botrytis cinerea\" (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi responsible for the rotting of grapes such as \"Aspergillus\" spp., \"Penicillium\" spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., \"Colletotrichum\" spp. (ripe rot) and \"Greeneria uvicola\" (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, \"Phomopsis viticola\"). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.\n\n\n"}

It was the most popular hors d'œuvre in Great Britain from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and also in the United States around this time. According to the English food writer Nigel Slater, the prawn cocktail \"has spent most of (its life) see-sawing from the height of fashion to the laughably passé\" and is now often served with a degree of irony.\n\nA dish of cooked seafood with a piquant sauce of some kind is of ancient origin and many varieties exist. Oyster or shrimp dishes of this kind were popular in the United States in the late nineteenth century and some sources link the serving of the dish in cocktail glasses to the ban on alcoholic drinks during the 1920s prohibition era in the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the invention of the Prawn Cocktail is often credited to British television chef Fanny Cradock in the 1960s; however, it is more likely that Cradock popularised her version of an established dish that was not well known until then in Britain. In their 1997 book \"The Prawn Cocktail Years\", Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham note that the prawn cocktail has a \"direct lineage to Escoffier\".\n\nThe sauce is usually referred to as cocktail sauce, and is essentially ketchup plus mayonnaise in commonwealth countries, or ketchup and horseradish in the United States.\n\nNigel Slater says \"It is all in the sauce\" and that \"The true sauce is principally mayonnaise, tomato ketchup and a couple of shakes of Tabasco.\"\n\nThe chef Heston Blumenthal states that prawn cocktail is his \"secret vice\", \"When I get home late after working in the Fat Duck there's nothing I like better than to raid the fridge for prawn cocktail\". Blumenthal notes that it is best to use homemade mayonnaise, and recommends adding chopped basil and tarragon.\n\nThe television chef and writer Delia Smith states that the best version is with prawns that you have cooked yourself, and that in the 1960s it was \"something simple but really luscious, yet over the years it has suffered from some very poor adaptations, not least watery prawns and inferior sauces\".\n\nAccording to the chef Jamie Oliver, the prawn cocktail is a \"wicked little starter ... guaranteed to please your guests\". His recipe includes garlic, cucumber, mint, salad cress and crabmeat, which demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of the basic concept.\n\nAs Hopkinson and Bareham note in \"The Prawn Cocktail Years\", what was once considered to be the \"Great British Meal\" consisted of Prawn Cocktail, followed by Steak Garni with Chips and Black Forest Gateau for dessert, commenting that \"cooked as it should be, this much-derided and often ridiculed dinner is still something very special indeed\".\n\nBefore the 1992 British general election, the Labour Party campaigned to win the support of business and financial leaders by persuading them that they would not interfere with the market economy. The campaign was lampooned as the \"Prawn Cocktail Offensive\".\n\nThe ubiquity of the prawn cocktail has led to such products as prawn cocktail flavour crisps, which are still one of the most popular varieties of this snack food. Prawn cocktail flavour crisps were the second most popular in the UK in 2004, with a 16% market share.\n\n"}
{"id": "3035627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3035627", "title": "Interrogatives in Esperanto", "text": "Interrogatives in Esperanto\n\nIn Esperanto there are two kinds of interrogatives: yes–no interrogatives, and correlative interrogatives.\n\nYes–no questions are formed with the interrogative \"ĉu\" \"whether\" at the beginning of the clause. For example, the interrogative equivalent of the statement \"La pomo estas sur la tablo\" \n\"The apple is on the table\" is \"Ĉu la pomo estas sur la tablo?\" \"Is the apple on the table?\" A yes–no question is also normally accompanied by a rising intonation. In some cases, especially when the context makes it clear that the sentence is an interrogative, a rising intonation alone can make a clause into a question, but this is uncommon and highly marked. The subject and the verb are \"not\" inverted to form questions as in English and many other European languages.\n\nEsperanto has a series of words that can be arranged in a table according to how they start and end. These are usually called \"correlatives\". The column of words that begin with \"ki-\" can be used to ask questions that cannot be answered by \"yes\" or \"no\". These correspond to wh-questions in English. These words are:\n\n\nThese words are inflected according to the role they play in the clause (for the words that take an inflection), and moved to the beginning of the clause. For example, \"Kion vi faras?\" - \"What are you doing?\" \"Kiu\" has the usual dual function of adjectives: standing alone as proform, or modifying a noun, as in \"\"Kiu tago?\"\" (which day?). \"Tio\" is exclusively used standing alone. As with yes–no questions, there is no inversion of subject and verb, and the sentence is generally ended with a rising intonation in the spoken language.\n\nAs explained above, any interrogative clause can be used as-is as an indirect question, e.g. as the object of a verb like \"scii\", \"to know\":\n\n\nBecause the correlatives that begin with \"ki-\" are also used to form relative clauses (similarly to many European languages) there is in theory a potential for ambiguity between indirect questions and relative clauses. In practice, however, confusion is very rare.\n"}

{"id": "3043804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3043804", "title": "Garri", "text": "Garri\n\nThe word \"Garri\" originates from the Hausa Language in West Africa. It is used to describe any powdery material, especially foodstuff, such as flour grains, e.g., \"Garin Dawa\" (guinea corn flour), \"Garin masara\" (maize flour), and \"Garin sukkhari\" (sugar), and particularly fried tapioca. It can also be used for ground substances, as in \"Garin Magani\" (powdery medicine).\n\nTypes of flour foodstuffs mixed with water used to be a major part of the diet in the Hausa lands and almost all parts of Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Liberia for many centuries. They were used by travellers in particular, who were often unable to carry cooked meals. Traveling on horseback or donkeys and trekking took a very long time and so required readily-available fast food. For example, while now it might take 75 minutes to go to Zaria from Kano, 120 years ago it was a 5-day journey, and so one needed to take a large amount of garri.\n\nThe age of this ancient word in Hausa language can be realized by its occurrence in old proverbs and in the naming of towns and villages.\n\nTo make garri, cassava tubers are peeled, washed and grated or crushed to produce a mash. The mash could be mixed with palm oil (oil garri) before being placed in a porous bag. It is then placed in an adjustable press machine for 1–3 hours to remove excess starchy water. When the cassava has become dry enough, it is ready for the next step. It is then sieved and fried in a large clay frying pot with or without palm oil. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.\n\nEba is a stiff dough made by soaking garri in hot water and kneading it with a wooden baton until it becomes a smooth doughy staple, that is served as part of a meal with various soups and sauces. Some of these include okra soup, egusi soup, vegetable soup, afang soup, banga soup and bitter leaf soup among others.\n\nKokoro is a common snack food in Nigeria, especially in southern and southeast Nigeria, especially Abia state, Rivers state, Anambra state, Enugu state and Imo state. It is made from a paste of maize flour, mixed with garri and sugar and deep-fried.\n\nGarri comes in various consistencies, which can roughly be categorized into rough, medium and smooth. Each type is used for a particular food.\n\nAs a snack, Cereal, or light meal, garri can be soaked in cold water (in which case it settles to the bottom), mixed with sugar or honey, and sometimes roasted. Peanuts or groundnut with/or evaporated milk are sometimes added. The amount of water needed for soaked garri is 3:1. Garri can also be eaten dry without water, but with sugar and roasted peanut added.\n\nIn its dry form, garri is used as an accompaniment for soft cooked beans and palm oil. This food mix is called \"yoo ke garri\" or \"Foto gari\" in the Ga language, in Ghana. Foto gari is the combination of moistened garri and stew, while yoo ke garri is garri with beans, a combination which is typically eaten as lunch. It is also eaten with beans cake in Nigeria.\n\nFor a full meal, garri is usually cooked by adding it to hot water, then kneading it into dough. This is eaten with different types of thick, leafy vegetable stews, melon seed stews, peanut stews, or beans.\n\nSmooth garri (known as lebu to the Yoruba) can be mixed with pepper and other spicy ingredients. A small amount of warm water and palm oil is added and mixed with the hand to soften up. This type of garri is served with fried fish. It is also served with frejon on Good Friday.\n\nIn West Africa, there are two types, white and yellow garri. Yellow garri is prepared by frying with the addition of palm oil to give it a yellow colour; white garri is fried without palm oil.\n\nMany variations of yellow and white garri are common across Nigeria. One variation of white garri is popularly known as garri-Ijebu. This is produced mainly by the Yoruba people of Ijebu origin.\n\nIn Ghana, garri is judged by its taste and grain size. The sweeter types with finer grains are more valued over sourer, large grain varieties. Commercial food vendors on the other hand prefer coarser grains with high starch content, as this yields more quantity when soaked in water.\n\nBuyers often look out for crispier grains when trying to determine freshness.\n\nGarri can be eaten without further cooking, as a snack, by placing it in a bowl adding cold water, sugar, groundnut and milk usually called garri soakings. For example, ijebu-garri is made with finer grains, and has a pleasantly sour taste, making it very suitable to be eaten in this way. In most parts of West African, sugar or honey is then added as well as chunks of coconut, groundnuts, tiger nuts milk, and cashew nuts.\n\nIn most garri recipes it is cooked by adding boiling water and stirring to make a stiff paste or porridge. Eba is normally eaten with different kinds of soups or stews. Most parts of Africa have an equivalent staple cassava dish. \n\nIn Liberia, Garri is used to make a dessert called Kanyan which is combined with peanuts and honey.\n\nCassava, the root from which garri is produced, is rich in fiber, copper and magnesium.\n\nGarri is made from cassava which contains hydrocyanic acid (cyanide), which, in sufficient quantity, can lead to serious eye defects, intestinal issues and worsening of ulcers. Proper and thorough processing of the garri should reduce the concentration of the acid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3045843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3045843", "title": "Dhammakaya Movement", "text": "Dhammakaya Movement\n\nThe Dhammakaya Movement, sometimes spelled as Thammakaai movement, is a Thai Buddhist tradition founded by Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro in the early 20th century. It is associated with several temples descended from Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen in Bangkok.\n\nThe tradition is distinguished from other Thai Buddhist traditions by its teachings on the Buddhist concept of \"Dhammakaya\" and the practice of Dhammakaya meditation (\"Vijja Dhammakaya\"), a method which scholars have connected to the Yogavacara tradition, which predates the 19th-century reform of Thai Buddhism. The Dhammakaya Movement is known for teaching that there is a \"true self\" connected with Nirvana, a belief that is rejected by the majority of the Thai Theravada community, who have criticized this as contradicting the Buddhist doctrine of \"anatta\" (not-self).\n\nThe Dhammakaya movement is seen by its followers as a form of Buddhist revivalism pioneered by Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro. Some Buddhist Studies scholars have called aspects of its practices as having some \"millenarian, fundamentalist\" characteristics. According to theologian Rory Mackenzie, the term \"fundamentalist\" may be misleading given the progressive nature of the movement. Features of the tradition include teaching meditation in a group, teaching meditation simultaneously to monastics and lay people, and an emphasis on lifelong ordination.\n\n\"Dhammakaya Movement\" refers to a modern Buddhist tradition that has emerged in Thailand, but is based on older \"Yogavacara\", c.q. Tantric Theravada teachings, which have survived the 19th and 20th century modernisation of Thai Buddhism. \"Dhammakaya\" means 'Dhamma body', referring to an \"inner Buddha nature,\" which its practitioners aim to realize through meditation.\n\nAccording to the anthropologist and Asian studies scholar Edwin Zehner, the term Dhammakaya (also spelled Thammakai) has four contextual meanings, though all four are \"written and pronounced exactly alike\":\n\nThe term Dhammakaya, states Zehner, has close affinities to the Mahayana Buddhism concept of \"Dharmakaya\" (spiritual essence of the Buddha), and the word appears in many early Pali and Sanskrit texts, where its early meaning was \"the collection of the dhamma\". However, the Dhammakaya movement's conception of the \"Dhammakaya\" doctrine is different from the definition found in the Pali-English dictionary of the Pali Text Society, states Zehner.\n\nNewell states the term \"Dhammakaya Movement\" has been confusingly used by various scholars. Some scholars use the term Dhammakaya movement interchangeably with Wat Phra Dhammakaya – the tradition's largest temple. She considers this problematic because this terminology has been used \"without distinguishing between the various temples practising dhammakaya meditation and Wat Dhammakaya itself... There are considerable differences in style, practice and structure of all the temples\". She prefers to use the term \"Dhammakaya temples\".\n\nShe is quoted on this by Religious Studies scholar Justin McDaniel, but he nevertheless uses \"Dhammakaya Movement\" without distinguishing between the various temples and Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Buddhist Studies scholar Crosby, on the other hand, uses \"Dhammakaya network\".\n\nScholars have theorized that the Dhammakaya movement has its roots in the Yogavacara tradition (also known as tantric Theravada; not to be confused with the Yogacara School in Mahayana Buddhism), which thrived in pre-modern, pre-colonial times. This ancestry would be related to , the former residence of (early 19th century), \"the heir to the teaching of Ayutthaya meditation masters,\" and the temple where Luang Pu Sodh used to practice before he went on to develop Dhammakaya meditation.\n\nAccording to Mackenzie, Yogavacara ideas are the most likely influence on Dhammakaya meditation system, though this is nor definitely proven. According to Buddhist Studies scholar Catherine Newell, \"there is no doubt that Dhammakaya meditation is based upon the broader yogavacara tradition.\" She presents evidence of the borrowing of Luang Pu Sodh's Dhammakaya system from Somdet Suk's system of meditation. She and Asian studies scholar Phibul Choompolpaisal believe a Yogavacara origin to be most likely. If this would be the case, the movement's meditation method would be an exoteric (openly taught) version of what initially was an esoteric tradition.\n\nAn alternative theory suggests an origin in Tibetan or other forms of Mahayana Buddhism. According to Mackenzie, it is possible but unlikely that someone who knew the Tibetan meditation methods met and shared that knowledge with Luang Pu Sodh in the early 1910s. There are similarities between the two systems, states Mackenzie, as well as with the concepts such as chakra (tantric psycho-physical centers), \"crystal sphere\" and \"Vajra\". Though these commonalities are widely accepted, no proof has emerged yet of the cross-fertilization of Tibetan Buddhist practices into Dhammakaya system. Yogavacara ideas are the most likely influence on Dhammakaya meditation system, but this too has yet to be proven, states Mackenzie. Newell acknowledges that Crosby doubts the link because of the two systems using different terminology.\n\nIt is alternatively possible that Luang Pu Sodh developed his approach based on his own psychic experiences.\n\nThe movement was started by Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro in the early twentieth century. In 1916, after three hours of meditating on the mantra \"sammā araham\", a Dhammakaya Foundation publication states \"his mind [suddenly] became still and firmly established at the very centre of his body,\" and he experienced \"a bright and shining sphere of \"Dhamma\" at the centre of his body, followed by new spheres, each \"brighter and clearer.\" According to Luang Pu Sodh, this was the true \"Dhamma\"-body, or \"Dhammakaya\", the \"spiritual essence of the Buddha and nibbana [which] exists as a literal reality within the human body,\" and the true Self (as opposed to the non-self). According to Mackenzie, \"Luang Phaw Sot sought to relate his breakthrough to the \"Satipatthana Sutta\". He interpreted a phrase which is normally understood as ‘contemplating the body as a body’ as contemplating the body in the body.\" According to Luang Pu Sodh, meditation could reveal \"a series of astral and spiritual bodies of progressive fineness\" within the physical body of a person.\n\nConvinced that he had attained the core of the Buddha's teaching, Phra Candasaro devoted the rest of his life to teaching, and furthering the depth of knowledge of Dhammakaya meditation, a meditation method which he also called \"Vijja Dhammakaya\", 'the direct knowledge of the Dhammakaya'. Temples in the tradition of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, together called the Dhammakaya Movement, believe that this method was the method the Buddha originally used to attain Enlightenment, but was lost five hundred years after the Buddha passed away. The rediscovery of Dhammakaya technique is usually described by the Dhammakaya movement in miraculous terms with cosmic elements. For example, it is mentioned that heavy rains purified the temple before the rediscovery.\n\nAfter discovering the Dhammakaya meditation approach, Luang Pu Sodh first taught it to others at Wat Bangpla, Bang Len District, Nakhon Pathom. Since Luang Pu Sodh was given his first position as abbot at Wat Paknam, Dhammakaya meditation has been associated with this temple. Other temples, such as Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram, also have their roots in Wat Paknam. It survived despite pressures in the nineteenth and early twentieth century to reform.\n\nDhammakaya meditation has been taught by Luang Pu Sodh's students at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, and at Wat Rajorasarama, as well as at the respective branches of these temples. Apart from these major temples, there are also several other centers that practice in the tradition of Luang Pu Sodh.\n\nMaechi Thongsuk (1900–1963) was a nun well-known for her meditation teaching. She was born on 1 August 1900 at Baan Saphan Lueang, Bangrak District, Bangkok. She was the third born to her father Rom and mother Wan. She was separated from her parents at an early age, being adopted by her uncle and aunt instead. She had no formal education and was illiterate. She married a surgeon at Chulalongkorn Hospital. They had two children together before the untimely death of her husband, after which she had to support herself and her children by working as a salesperson.\n\nIn 1930, Thongsuk Samdaengpan started to study meditation at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen under the instruction of Luang Pu Sodh. As a laywoman, and later as a \"maechi\", she taught high-profile supporters of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, such as Liap Sikanchananand. It was at Liap's house that Maechi Thongsuk met Chandra Khonnokyoong, who she taught Dhammakaya meditation. After the two stayed for a month at Wat Paknam, they both ordained as \"maechis.\" Maechi Thongsuk travelled around Thailand to spread the Dhamma and teach Dhammakaya Meditation according to the policy of Luang Pu Sodh. Maechi Thongsuk was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 1960, and died of it on 3 February 1963 at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen. She was aged sixty-three, having been a \"maechi\" for twenty-five years.\n\nMaechi Chandra (1909–2000) became strongly interested in meditation when she was still a child, after she was cursed by her drunken father. After he died, she wished to reconcile with him through contacting him in the afterlife. In 1935, she went to Bangkok to work and find a way to meet Luang Pu Sodh. After she met Maechi Thongsuk and learnt meditation from her, she ordained at Wat Paknam. She later became a prominent meditation student of Luang Pu Sodh. After Luang Pu Sodh's death, she became instrumental in introducing Dhammakaya meditation to Luang Por Dhammajayo and Luang Por Dattajivo, with whom she later founded Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Luang Por Dhammajayo and Luang Por Dattajivo, the current abbot and vice-abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, were students of \"maechi\" (nun) Chandra Khonnokyoong.\n\nMeditation is the most important practice of all major temples in the Dhammakaya Movement. The meditation system of the movement distinguishes it from mainstream Theravada Buddhism. According to Suwanna Satha-Anand, the movement believes that meditation and the attainment of the Dhammakaya is the only way to Nirvana. The meditation method is claimed by its teachers to accelerate the attainment of Nirvana. Additionally, this technique is claimed in its advanced stages to allow the meditator to visit past lives and alternate planes of existence, wherein one can affect the present life's circumstances.\n\nEssential in this process is the \"center of the body\", which Luang Pu Sodh precisely describes as being at a point two finger widths above the navel of each person: whatever technique someone might use to meditate, the mind can only attain a higher level of insight through this center. This center is also believed to play a fundamental role in the birth and death of an individual.\n\nThere are several techniques which can be used by practitioners in focusing the attention on the center of the body.\n\nPractitioners may visualize a mental image at the center of the body – characteristically, a crystal ball or a crystal clear Buddha image. This has been compared with meditation on a bright object in the Visuddhimagga. Practitioners then visualize this image in front of themselves, and then move the mental image inwards through seven bases of the mind. Once the mental hindrances are overcome, the visual image imagined is transformed.\n\nPractitioners may also use a \"mantra\" () \"Sammā-Arahaṃ\", which refers to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (\"sammā\") attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (\"arahaṃ\"), as can be found in the traditional \"Tiratanavanda\" chant. This is a form of \"Buddhanussati\", i.e. recollecting the Buddha qualities. This mantra has also been used by monks from Northern Thailand.\n\nAlternatively, according to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, practitioners can also place the attention at the center of the body directly, and can even do so without visualizing or using a mantra.\n\nThe first stage of this path Luang Pu Sodh simply called the 'beginning of the path' (). After that, Luang Pu Sodh would usually describe the level of attainment in terms of inner bodies (\"\") within every human being, which are successively more subtle, and come in pairs. In total, every human being consists of nine types of bodies, each of which has a normal and refined form.\n\nThe first four pairs of these bodies are equated with the orthodox \"jhāna\" meditation attainments. Next is the 'change-of-lineage' () intermediary Dhammakaya state: this is the intermediate state between not being enlightened yet, and the four stages of enlightenment. The final four of these inner pairs are called the \"Dhammakayas\", and are equated with the four stages of enlightenment, leading to the final stage of enlightenment (\"arahant\").\n\nAfter practitioners have attained the \"Dhammakaya\", they can gain insight into the reality of life through observation of their own physical and mental processes. It is believed they can understand birth, death and suffering at a deeper level, when they see the literal essence of these phenomena through meditative attainment.\n\nAccording to the Dhammakaya Movement, the Buddha made the discovery that nirvana is the true Self (). The movement calls this true self the \"Dhammakāya\", the spiritual essence. The Movement believes that this essence of the Buddha and Nirvana exist as a literal reality within each individual. The not-self teaching () is considered by the movement a means to let go of what is not the self, to attain the true self. According to Buddhist studies scholar Paul Williams,\nSome of the beliefs and practices of the Dhammakaya movement – such as about \"nirvana\", \"true self\" and meditation – have been criticized as allegedly opposing or rejecting the mainstream Theravada teachings and practices by traditional Thai Buddhist institutions, including Thailand's Religious Affairs Department and several Thai journalists and scholars. The bulk of Thai Theravada Buddhism rejects the true-self teaching of Dhammakaya, and insists upon absolute non-self as the Buddha's real teaching. Thai monastic and scholar Prayudh Payutto has written much about this topic. Payutto states, in his book \"The Dhammakaya Case\", that the \"Nibbāna [Nirvana] is Higher Self (\"atta\")\" teaching of Dhammakaya \"insults\" the Buddhist canonical and post-canonical teachings. He continues that the historic Theravāda teachings emphasize \"nirvana\" in the context of \"anattā\", and the \"\"nirvana\" as \"attā\"\" is not an acceptable interpretation.\n\nAccording to proponents of the movement such as Luang Por Sermchai, it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, whereas \"several distinguished forest hermit monks\" such as Luang Pu Sodh, Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Maha Bua hold Nirvana as true self, because they have \"confirmed the existence of a Higher or Real Self (\"attā\")\" by their own realizations. He further states that Nirvana cannot be not-self because it not a compounded and conditioned phenomenon. Williams summarizes the views of Luang Por Sermchai and states that these ways of reading Buddhism in terms of \"... a true Self certainly seem to have been congenial in the East Asian environment, and hence flourished in that context where for complex reasons Mahayana too found a ready home\". According to Williams, the Dhammakaya-related debate in Thailand leads to an appreciation that \n\nAccording to James Taylor, a scholar of Religious Studies and Anthropology, Dhammakaya's doctrinal views on \"nirvana\" and \"enduring notions of self\" are similar to the Personalist School of early Buddhism. The Dhammakaya doctrines may be better seen as an example of \"hybridized Buddhism\" similar to the Mahāyāna Buddhist association Fo Guang Shan in Taiwan, states Taylor. Paul Williams states that in some respects the teachings of the Dhammakaya Movement resemble the Buddha-nature and Trikaya doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism. He sees the Dhammakaya Movement as having developed independently of the Mahayana \"Tathagatagarbha\" tradition, but as achieving very similar results in their understanding of Buddhism. Potprecha Cholvijarn has compared and contrasted the Dhammakaya and \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrines, as well as the meditative practices taught by Dhammakaya's Luang Pu Sodh and those in the Tibetan Shentong (\"gzhan stong\") tradition.\n\nThe Dhammakaya Movement has responded in different ways to the debate of self and not-self. Apart from Luang Por Sermchai, Wat Phra Dhammakaya's assistant-abbot Luang phi Ṭhanavuddho wrote a book about the topic in response to critics. According to Rungrawee Chalermsripinyorat, the followers of the movement seem not much interested in the discussion, and are more concerned how Dhammakaya meditation improves their mind. Besides the unorthodox definition of Nirvana as true happiness, permanent and essential, Nirvana is also described by the movement from a more orthodox perspective, as the absence of greed, hatred and delusion. Religion scholar Rachelle Scott states that the positive description of Nirvana as a state of supreme happiness may have contributed to the popularity of Wat Phra Dhammakaya to new members.\n\nAround 1969, Luang Por Dhammajayo of Wat Phra Dhammakaya expressed his opposition to the traditional \"elaborate Buddhist ritual, protective magic, fortune telling, and the tools, images and money that went toward them\", states McDaniel. Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram, similarly, states its premises are \"free from superstitious objects and magic\". In practice, the Dhammakaya's publications extensively emphasize the miraculous and healing power of amulets, and markets and distributes them.\n\nLuang Pu Sodh, the founder of the Dhammakaya movement, is believed by the adherents to have been a man of unusual powers. His biographies have included claims of supernatural powers, but also as someone who \"showed respect for every method he learned\", even \"black magic\", states Newell. He has been portrayed as opposing amulet collection, yet amulets with magical powers were issued under his leadership. He is known as a meditation master and healer to the Thai people. According to McDaniel, his meditation practice is taught in the Wat Phra Dhammakaya to \"develop self-confidence\", help in \"family and business matters\". At Dhammakaya retreats, some of this temple's adherents state that amulets, magic and ordination are arbitrary to the path of spiritual and financial security, according to McDaniel.\n\nThe movement does claim miracles from its meditation practice. According to Seeger, such claims and widespread use of miracles by the movement has been one of the sources of controversy from the traditional Thai Buddhist establishment. Examples include stories of miraculous events such as Luang Pu Sodh performing \"miraculous healings\" at Wat Paknam, and meditation stopping the Allies from dropping an atom bomb on Bangkok due to the Japanese occupation of Thailand in World War II. Similarly, Wat Phra Dhammakaya has included claims of miracles in its advertisements along with images of \"Mahsiriratthat amulets\" with miraculous powers. These advertisements invite readers to visit the temple to witness these miraculous events.\n\nAccording to Mano Laohavanichformerly associated with Wat Phra Dhammakayasome in the Dhammakaya movement believe in a mythical ongoing cosmic struggle between the \"Black Dhammakāya\" (Mara) and the \"White Dhammakāya\" with the idea that Luang Por Dhammajayo is a messiah and reincarnation of the Buddha. According to the Buddhist Studies scholar Peter Harvey, the group meditation is seen in part as a means to \"help overcome the influence of evil Mara\" against this world.\n\nMackenzie states that meditating together to impact this struggle between the white party and black party is seen by these adherents to be both an individual and collective responsibility. This mythical struggle can be won by a critical mass of meditators, according to this belief, and this is considered to be a holy task. Mackenzie states it is unclear how many of the movement's followers believe this myth about White versus Black Dhammakaya, or that \"Dhammajayo was a Buddha reincarnation\". Mackenzie quotes Choompolpaisal stating that this is not an \"insider's understanding\", and Mackenzie continues that \"he has also met members who look to experience the miraculous at the temple\". He finds it unlikely \"they would not believe that their leader is an Avatara [reincarnation of the Buddha]\". Mackenzie concludes the adherents at the temple may have many \"insider understandings as people participate in the life of the temple in different ways\".\n\nThe Dhammakaya movement's practitioners state they find its teachings efficacious and transformative.\n\nAs part of a survey of fundamentalistic movements around the globe, Donald Swearer has termed the Dhammakaya movement as \"fundamentalistic\" in orientation. By \"fundamentalism\" he is referring to the emerging tendencies in Theravada communities of Thailand and Sri Lanka where a \"religiously grounded communal identity\" is asserted along with an activist role of the laity. This tendency includes an apologetic, modernistic reinterpretation and reassertion of doctrines and practices, one that is combined with a \"uniquely aggressive, critical, negative and absolutist\" character. According to Mackenzie, the movement's practices are akin to a \"prosperity movement\" with some \"millenarian, fundamentalist\" characteristics. Yet, the movement does not quite resonate with the \"fundamentalist\" classification, states Mackenzie. The term can be misleading because of movement's size, commitment to meditation and its progressive nature.\n\nOther scholars describe the Dhammakaya movement as a revivalist movement. Whether the movement is a new movement is a matter of debate; Wat Phra Dhammakaya, for one, has specifically said that they do not want to start a new monastic fraternity (\"nikaya\"). Central to the movement is the Dhammakaya meditation practice, which the movement considers the method through which the Buddha became enlightened, a method which was forgotten but has been revived by Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro. This method is called \"Vijja Dhammakaya\".\n\nSeveral scholars, states Martin Seeger, have described the disputes and relationship between the mainstream Thai Sangha and the Dhammakaya movement as reflecting \"intolerance and undermining freedom of religion\". According to Seeger, the teachings and practices of the Dhammakaya movement temples deviate from the Theravāda tradition, and the different interpretations of Buddhist canonical texts have triggered a heated debate in the Thai media and in the Sangha Council, a smear campaign and the purging of \"religious others\". Of these, Wat Phra Dhammakayathe most influential in this regardhas been accused by Payutto of \"distorting Buddhist ideas, insulting Buddha's teachings\", and showing \"disrespect to the Pali canon\". Besides Payutto, other critics have included a number of \"Thai scholars, academics, monks and social critics\". Payutto has been criticized in return by a number of Thai academics and news commentators for being \"narrow-minded\", \"attached to scriptures\", \"dogmatist\" and a \"purist\". Also, Thai columnist Sopon Pornchokchai has accused Payutto of performing sloppy research.\n\nLuang Pu Sodh introduced Dhammakaya meditation, which is the core of the Dhammakaya movement. Besides the technique of meditation itself, the methods through which Luang Pu Sodh taught have also been passed on to the main temples in the movement. The movement has an active style of propagation. Teaching meditation in a group, teaching meditation during ceremonies, teaching meditation simultaneously to monastics and lay people, and teaching one main meditation method to all are features which can be found throughout the movement.\n\nNewell relates that Luang Pu Sodh was the person who set up the \"maechi\" community at Wat Paknam, which is currently one of the largest \"maechi\" communities in Thailand. Although Luang Pu Sodh encouraged women to become \"maechis\", \"maechis\" did have to spend quite some time doing domestic activities, more so than monks. This orientation echoes in Wat Phra Dhammakaya's approach to female spirituality, praising Maechi Chandra as an example of a meditation master, but at the same time not supporting the \"Bhikkhuni\" ordination movement.\n\nBesides Wat Paknam's attitudes with regard to female spirituality, Wat Paknam's international orientation also became part of its heritage. The temple ordained several monks coming from the United Kingdom, and maintained relations with Japanese Buddhists. Currently, Wat Paknam has branch centers in the United States, Japan and New Zealand. This international orientation was also continued through the work of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, which, , had thirty to fifty international centers, and through the work of Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram, which has two branch centers in Malaysia. Of all Thai Buddhist temples and movements, the Dhammakaya movement has an international presence that is one of the strongest. A characteristic that is also found both in Wat Paknam and other temples in Luang Pu Sodh's tradition, is its emphasis on lifelong ordination.\n\nThe production and sale of protective amulets to finance the Dhammakaya movement's early initiatives began with the founder of the movement. Wat Paknam, in Luang Pu Sodh's leadership, produced amulets (Thai: \"phra khruang rang\") that gained a reputation for their alleged powers and were traded at high prices. According to Newell,\n\nLuang Pu Sodh's amulets were—and are still—widely venerated for their powers, and are traded as expensive items. The production and sale of amulets has been \"a common method of financing major temple building projects\", according to Newell. The Phutthamonthon park effort was started under Luang Pu Sodh's leadership in the 1950s and much of the construction work done in the 1970s. Wat Phra Dhammakaya, after its founding in early 1970s, has continued to aggressively market amulets with alleged magical powers for fundraising purposes. It leverages the Buddhist merit-making tradition in Thailand.\n\nWat Paknam Bhasicharoen () is a royal wat located in Phasi Charoen District, Bangkok, at the Chao Phraya River. Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen is the temple where Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro used to be the abbot, and still is known for its meditation lessons. The temple underwent a major change during the period that Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro became the temple's abbot, from a temple with only thirteen monks that was in disrepair, to a prosperous center of education and meditation practice. In 2008, it housed two hundred to four hundred monks, eighty to ninety \"samanera\" (young novices) and two hundred to three hundred \"maechis\" (nuns). the temple's abbot was Somdet Chuang Varapuñño, who was the acting Supreme Patriarch of Thailand (\"Sangharaja\") from 2013 to 2017. In 2015, he was proposed by the Sangha Supreme Council as the new Supreme Patriarch, but the appointment was stalled by the \"junta,\" which cited objections by several influential former leaders of the 2014 coup d'état. The appointment was eventually withdrawn and a monk from the Dhammayuttika Nikaya appointed instead after the \"junta\" changed the law to allow the King to appoint the Supreme Patriarch directly, with the Prime Minister countersigning.\n\nWat Phra Dhammakaya is located in Pathum Thani, north of Bangkok. It was founded by Maechi Chandra Khonnokyoong and Luang Por Dhammajayo. It is the temple that is most well-known in the Dhammakaya Movement because of its huge size and following, its numerous activities and also its controversies. The temple is popular among the Bangkok middle class, and organizes many training programs. The temple emphasizes merit-making through meditation, giving and volunteering. According to theologian Rory Mackenzie, it accepts donations from its adherents in large public meetings, promising \"specific results for particular donations\".\n\n, the temple's worldwide following was estimated at three million practitioners. The community living at Wat Phra Dhammakaya numbered more than a thousand monks and novices, and hundreds of full-time lay employees. The temple emphasizes the revival of traditional Buddhist values, but does so through modern methods and technology. The temple emphasizes personal transformation, expressed through its slogan \"World Peace through Inner Peace\". The temple offers English language retreats and ordinations.\n\nInitially, the temple was founded as a meditation center, after Maechi Chandra and the just ordained monk Luang Por Dhammajayo could no longer accommodate the rising number of participants in their activities at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen. The center became an official temple in 1977. The temple grew exponentially during the 1980s, when the temple's training programs became widely known among the urban middle class. Wat Phra Dhammakaya expanded its area and the building of a huge \"stupa\" (pagoda) was started. During the period of the Asian economical crisis, however, the temple became subject to criticism as Luang Por Dhammajayo was charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, he was cleared of these charges and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further and became known for its activities in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship projects. Under the 2014 military \"junta\", the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money through the donations of a supporter. The temple has been referred to as the only influential organization in Thailand that has yet to be subdued by the ruling junta, which has shut down most opposition since it took power. The judicial processes against the abbot and the temple since the 1990s have led to much debate regarding the procedures and role of the state towards religion, a debate that has intensified during the 2017 lockdown of the temple by the junta. As of 2017, authorities have not found Luang Por Dhammajayo, and in 2018, Phrakhru Sangharak Rangsarit was assigned as the official abbot instead.\n\nWat Phra Dhammakaya emphasizes a culture of making merit through doing good deeds and meditation, as well as an ethical outlook on life. The temple promotes a community of \"kalyanamittas\" ('good friends') to accomplish such a culture. Although the temple emphasizes traditional Buddhist values, modern methods of propagation are used, such as a satellite television station and a distance-learning university, as well as modern management methods. In its large temple complex, the temple houses several monuments and memorials, and in its construction designs traditional Buddhist concepts are given modern forms, as the temple envisions itself as a global spiritual center.\n\nAccording to Sandra Cate, an anthropologist with a focus on Southeast Asia, the historic merit-making Buddhist practice has been \"taken to new extremes\" by Wat Phra Dhammakaya in how it seeks monetary donations and deploys sophisticated marketing techniques and networking. The production and sale of amulets has been \"a common method of financing major temple building projects\", according to Newell. To raise donations in the 1990s, the Wat Phra Dhammakaya made claims of \"miracle in the sky\" where the sun disappeared and was replaced by a golden statue of Luang Pu Sodh or giant crystal in the sky. The accumulation of great merit (Thai: \"phu mi bun\") has been linked in this movement to \"mahapurusha\" (great person) status, radiant complexion and spiritual perfection. These merit-making practices as a \"solution to all personal and social problems\" and thereby \"luring faithful devotees to make ever-increasing donations\" have been criticized by Phra Mettanando. Dhammakaya fundraising efforts deploy mass marketing campaigns that relate \"levels of donations to their class status\", according to Scott. According to Rungrawee Chalermsripinyorat, the publications of Wat Phra Dhammakaya repeatedly reinforce the belief in the fruits of merit-making and amulets by \"reproducing stories of a miraculous survival after a severe car accident, an unexplainable recovery from malignant cancer and incredible success in business after making merit\".\n\nWat Phra Dhammakaya relies on donations and merit making to build temples and operate its organization. It runs consumer-savvy media placement and billboards to deploy \"consumerist competitive and advertising strategy with the traditional belief of merit accumulation which ends up in the merchandization of merit\", states sociologist Apinya Fuengfusakul. The donors are promised rewards in future rebirths, and their donations are recognized in public ceremonies. Although many of the temple's methods and teachings were not unique to Wat Phra Dhammakaya, it was noticeably criticized in the late 1990s during the Asian economic crisis due to its size and the major fundraising the temple was doing at the time. According to Asian Studies scholar Monica Falk, the commercialization of Buddhism has become a political issue in Thailand.\n\nWat Rajorasarama (or for short, Wat Rajaoros; literally 'the temple of the King's son'), Bang Khun Thian District, Bangkok, originates from the Ayutthaya Kingdom era. It became a royal temple, figuring in the history of the Chakri dynasty when Prince Rama III resided and held a ceremony there to prepare for an attack during the Burmese–Siamese wars. After having spent a while at the temple preparing, the attack did not happen. Nevertheless, Rama III repaid his gratitude to the temple by renovating it from 1817 to 1831. During the renovations, texts about traditional Thai medicine and massage were carved in the temple's walls. This was done in Wat Pho as well, making for a total of thousand inscriptions, meant as a storehouse of ancient knowledge which Rama III feared might be lost during the wars. When the renovations had started, he dedicated the temple to his father Rama II, who renamed the temple \"Wat Rajorasarama\". The temple is often described as \"the temple of King Rama III\", citing his stay there during the Burmese–Siamese Wars, and the subsequent construction he started there. However, in reality, Rama III grew up in the area of Wat Chomthong, not in the palace, and was therefore familiar with the temple from his childhood onward.\n\nIn the 1950s, the temple was nearly abandoned and derelict. After the appointment of Luang Por Thongdi Suratejo as abbot in 1982, and with financial help from the government, the temple was greatly renovated. Luang Por Thongdi spent many years at Wat Paknam, completing his Pali studies there to the highest level. He held several positions in the Thai Sangha before being appointed as a member of the Supreme Sangha Council in 1992. He is well-known in Thailand for his encyclopedias and books, of which he has published over twenty, under his honorary names.\n\nIn 2001, Luang Por Thongdi made headlines when he was suddenly removed from the Sangha Council, because the Supreme Patriarch felt he \"acted against the decisions of the council\". During that period, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra had announced several reforms of the Monastic Act, aiming for a Sangha that is more independent of the government. Luang Por Thongdi expressed his disagreement with the proposed reforms by publishing a book about them. He stated the Sangha Council was rash in its decisions, and doubted whether the monastic establishment was ready to be self-reliant. A network run by scholars and devotees stated the book was inappropriate and they pleaded with the Sangha Council to act. As soon as Luang Por Thongdi was removed from the office, practitioners of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and students of Wat Rajaoros' school protested against the decision, but Luang Por Thongdi asked them to stop in order not to express contempt of the Supreme Patriarch. Meanwhile, PM Thaksin admitted he was \"shocked\" by the Supreme Patriarch's decision. Whereas the network of critics stated Luang por Thongdi \"always had opposing views\" and caused division, the head of the Religious Affairs Department responded \"monks should have the right to air their views\". When Luang Por Thongdi himself was asked how he felt about the decision, he replied \"We are born in this world without anything [without position or possessions]. Having been a member of the Sangha Council, I have served Buddhism, which is the highest good in life. ... The right thing to do [now] is to accept the decision made [by the Supreme Patriarch]\". Luang Por Thongdi also clarified that he was not opposed to reform and more independence from the government, but the Sangha should still have an important role in moral education, which he felt was overlooked in the reforms.\n\nIn 1982, Wat Paknam-ordained Luang Por Sermchai Jayamangalo and Phra Khru Bart Yanathiro established the Buddhabhavana Vijja Dhammakaya Institute, distancing itself from Wat Phra Dhammakaya. In 1991, the institute was changed into a temple. It is located in Ratchaburi Province, west of Bangkok, and is currently led by Luang Por Sermchai. He was formerly a lay meditation teacher at Wat Paknam, and a researcher and employee of the US embassy. Many of the temple's activities are done in cooperation with Wat Saket. Luang Por Sermchai teaches regularly to government departments, companies, and other temples. In 2004, Luang Por Sermchai made headlines when he criticized the government's policy on legalizing gambling during a preaching on a radio program. After some members of the government responded with displeasure, a screening process for preaching on the radio was established. Luang Por Sermchai defended the radio broadcast, stating that his criticism referred to society in general, not just the government.\n\nIn 2006, there were seventy monks and thirty-three novices at the temple. Phra Khru Bart was a western monk who organized exchange student programs and gave meditation instruction and retreats in English language. English instruction is still available, though Phra Khru Bart has since died. In Thai language, the temple offers retreats, monastic ordination programs, and study retreats for families. The temple also runs its own school with Pali and Dhamma studies.\n\nApart from an \"ubosot\" hall (central hall for ordinations), the temple also has a memorial hall in honor of Luang Pu Sodh. In 2006, the temple started building a \"stupa\" (mound-like shaped monument). The \"stupa\" will be four storeys high and will measure 108 meters in length, width and depth. It will contain meditation rooms, Buddha images, and relics. the monument was still under construction.\n\nLuang Por Sermchai had been taught about Dhammakaya meditation by Phra Veera Gaṇuttamo, teacher at Wat Paknam. On 7 October 2018, Luang Por Sermchai died, aged 90 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3046421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3046421", "title": "Fish boil", "text": "Fish boil\n\nA fish boil is a culinary tradition in areas of Wisconsin and along the coastal Upper Great Lakes, with large Scandinavian populations. Fish boils enjoy a particularly strong presence in Door County, Port Wing and Port Washington, Wisconsin. The meal most often consists of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior whitefish (though lake trout or locally caught salmon can be used), with other ingredients.\n\nMany credit Scandinavian immigrants for bringing the fish boil to Door County. Fish boils were originally used to feed large crowds of lumberjacks and fishermen. It was a quick economic way to feed large groups of people. As the area grew as a tourist destination, it became a popular attraction at local restaurants.\nThe fish is typically caught by local fishermen, cut into small chunks and cooked in boiling water with red potatoes. Some boilers add onions as well. Salt is the only seasoning used, and used only to raise the specific gravity of the water. Up to one pound of salt per two gallons of water is used.\n\nThe cooking of the fish is an elaborate presentation. Restaurants typically ask that patrons arrive a half-hour early to witness the boiling. The fish and potatoes are prepared in a cast-iron kettle. When the water comes to a boil, the potatoes, kept in a wire basket, are lowered in.\n\nThe fish are then placed in another wire basket and lowered in. After 9–10 minutes, when the fish are cooked, the oils rise to the top of the pot. The boiler then tosses a small amount of kerosene on the fire and the increase in flames causes a boilover. The fish oils spill over the side of the pot and the fish is done. The fish chunks remain whole and firm. Chefs usually drip melted butter over the fish before serving. Although not part of the traditional recipe, tartar sauce and lemon slices are often served with the fish. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3046460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3046460", "title": "Kofta", "text": "Kofta\n\nKofta is a family of meatball or meatloaf dishes found in the Indian subcontinent, South Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Balkan, and Central Asian cuisines. In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls of minced or ground meat—usually beef, chicken, lamb, or pork—mixed with spices and/or onions. In the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East, koftas are usually made from lamb, beef, mutton or chicken, whereas Greek, Cypriot, and Balkan versions may use pork, beef, lamb, or mixture of the three. In India, vegetarian varieties include koftas made from potato, calabash, paneer, or banana. In Europe, kofta is often served in a fast-food sandwich in kebab shops.\n\nKoftas in India are usually served cooked in a spicy curry/gravy and are eaten with boiled rice or a variety of Indian breads. In Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan, koftas are served with a spiced gravy, as dry variations are considered to be kebabs. Shrimp and fish koftas are found in South India, West Bengal, and some parts of the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe word \"kofta\" comes from Classical Persian \"kōfta\" (), meaning \"rissole\", from the verb \"kōftan\" (), \"to pound\" or \"to grind\", reflecting the ground meat used for the meatballs. The languages of the region have adopted the word with minor phonetic variation.\n\nThe meat is often mixed with other ingredients, such as rice, bulgur, vegetables, or eggs to form a smooth paste. They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked, or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce. Koftas are sometimes made from fish or vegetables rather than red meat, especially in India; Variations occur in North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and India. They can be shaped into patties, meat balls or cigar like shapes.\n\nAccording to a 2005 study done by a private food company, 291 different kinds of kofta were found in Turkey. Turkish variations include a meatball stew called \"sulu köfte\", kadınbudu köfte. \"Batırık köftesi\" is a vegan variety that uses tahini as a binding ingredient instead of the usual egg. \"Çiğ köfte\" is a vegetarian variety made with lentils or bulgur. Kibbeh, a deep fried meatball made from a bulgur and potato shell stuffed with ground meat and other ingredients, are called \"içli köfte\" in Turkish.\n\nEarly recipes (included in some of the earliest known Arabic cookbooks) generally concern seasoned lamb rolled into orange-sized balls, and glazed with egg yolk and sometimes saffron. This method was taken to the West and is referred to as \"gilding\" or \"endoring\". Many regional variations exist, notable among them include the unusually large Azerbaijani (Iranian) \"Tabriz köftesi\", having an average diameter of 20 cm, (8 in).\n\nSushrutha Samhita mentions meatballs made of ground meat and was termed pishtha. Koftas in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent are normally cooked in a spiced gravy, or curry, and sometimes simmered with hard-boiled eggs. Vegetarian koftas are eaten by a large population in India. The British dish Scotch egg may have been inspired by the Indian dish Nargisi kofta (\"Narcissus kofta\"), where hard-boiled eggs are encased in a layer of spicy kofta meat. In Bengal, a region of eastern India, koftas are made from prawns, fish, green bananas, cabbage or meat, such as minced goat meat.\n\nThere are many variations of kofta dish. The new fruity flavour variation is Kathal Ke Kofte or Koftas of jackfruit. It is a vegetarian dish and very popular in India. This dish includes ingredients like boiled jackfruit, mashed potatoes, green chilli, coriander, red chilli powder, garam masala etc. This kofte served with roti and garnish with fresh cream and coriander leaves.\n\nIn Israel, meat kofta is part of the Mizrahi Jewish cuisine, and is made of minced meat, herbs, and spices, and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup, or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans. A fish variety is prepared with minced fish, coriander, dried peppers (bell peppers and chili peppers), onion, black pepper, and salt, and is usually cooked in a tomato stew with chickpeas or white beans. The word \"kufta\" in Modern Hebrew, however, is used to describe a broad variety of dough dumplings, and was coined after the mention in the Jerusalem Talmud, written \"circa\" 200 CE.\n\nIn Albania, specialized shops called \"qofteri\" offer \"qofte\". They are considered to be a specialty of Korçë, where they are called \"kernacka\". Qofte are usually served on a metal plate, salted, and topped with fresh raw onions with bread. Beer is the most popular beverage accompaniment.\n\nIn Central Asia, kofta is cooked with liberal amounts of tail fat.\n\nIn Bulgaria, kofta is usually made from pork, beef, or veal, or a mixture of the three. They are usually served as a \"meze\" with \"tarator\".\n\nIn the former Yugoslav republics, present day Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia, they are called \"ćufte\" or \"ćufteta\". They are made of any single meat including fish, or mixture of meats, mixed with finely chopped onions, breadcrumbs, eggs, and seasonings. They are most often made by first being browned and then simmered in a roux made with paprika called \"crvena zaprška\" \"red roux\", or in a tomato sauce similar to Italo-American meatballs.\n\nIn Greece and Cyprus, kofta is usually fried and eaten with tzatziki or yogurt.\n\nIn Lebanon, kafta is usually prepared by mixing the ground beef with onion, parsley, allspice, black pepper, and salt.\n\nIn Morocco, kufta may be prepared in a tagine.\n\nIn Pakistan, kofta is made from ground beef with onion, spices, and salt. Nargisi kofta with hard boiled egg encased in spicy kofta are also popular.\n\nIn Jordan, they are usually made of beef, chicken, lamb, or a mixture of chicken and beef with allspice, parsley, mint, onion, black pepper, and salt and are fried in olive oil or cooked in tomato or pomegranate stews. Kofta in the Palestinian Community is very similar to the Jordanian kofta, as they are considered by many to be the same ethnic group. It also pronounced as kafta, is made of minced meat, usually beef or veal, or a mixture of beef with lamb. It contains herbs, finely chopped onions and spices, and it is either flattened on a tray and called \"suneyet kofta\", or made into patties; the kofta is then either baked or cooked and simmered with tomato sauce, tahini sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup, or tamarind syrup, and typically accompanied by potatoes or other vegetables. Another common variety of Palestinian kofta is a \"kofta bi batata\", which consists of a bed of thinly sliced potatoes in layers under flattened kofta baked in a tray.\n\nIn Romania, a local variety of kofta is known as \"chiftele\" or \"chiftea\". They are usually made from minced pork, mixed with mashed potatoes and spices, then deep-fried. They are served with pilaf or mashed potatoes. The Romanian Jews prepare a version of lofts which has a large amount of garlic and parsley, along with a small amount of sugar. Their traditional kofta is often served with an eggplant salad, and is sometimes called “Garlic Torpedoes” in the West.\n"}

Like in ceviche, a pickling marinade of lemon juice, fresh coconut, green onions, salt and spicy hot peppers or \"donni' \" is used to marinate cooked chicken, raw shrimp, fish or beef meat/liver. With the exception of the cooked chicken, the acids in the marinade \"cook\" the raw shrimp, fish or beef instead of heat. It is served cold or at room temperature and eaten as is, over rice, or wrapped in a warm corn or flour tortilla (or the Chamorro version, \"titiyas\").\n\n\"Kelaguen\" is derived from the Filipino \"kilawin\". It was introduced by Filipino settlers when the Marianas and the Philippines were both part of the Spanish East Indies. \"Kelaguen\", however, has diverged in that it also incorporates influences from Latin American ceviche.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3049794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3049794", "title": "Thanksgiving dinner", "text": "Thanksgiving dinner\n\nThe centerpiece of contemporary Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada is a large meal, generally centered on a large roasted turkey. It is served with a variety of side dishes which vary from traditional dishes such as mashed potatoes, stuffing, and cranberry sauce, to ones that reflect regional or cultural heritage. The majority of the dishes in the traditional American version of Thanksgiving dinner are made from foods native to the New World, as according to tradition the Pilgrims received these foods, or learned how to grow them, from the Native Americans. Thanksgiving dinner is the largest eating event in the United States; people eat more on Thanksgiving than on any other day of the year.\n\nAccording to what traditionally is known as \"The First Thanksgiving,\" the 1621 feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag at Plymouth Colony contained waterfowl, venison, ham, lobster, clams, berries, fruit, pumpkin, and squash. William Bradford noted that, \"besides waterfowl, there was great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many.\" Many of the foods that were included in the first feast (except, notably, the seafood) have since gone on to become staples of the \"modern\" Thanksgiving dinner. Early feasts of the Order of Good Cheer, a French Canadian predecessor to the modern Thanksgiving, featured a potluck dinner with freshly-hunted fowl, game, and fish, hunted and shared by both French Canadians and local natives.\n\nThe use of the turkey in the US for Thanksgiving precedes Lincoln's nationalization of the holiday in 1863. Alexander Hamilton proclaimed that no \"Citizen of the United States should refrain from turkey on Thanksgiving Day,\" and Benjamin Franklin had high regard for the wild turkey as an American icon, but turkey was uncommon as Thanksgiving fare until after 1800. By 1857, turkey had become part of the traditional dinner in New England.\n\nThe \"White House Cook Book\", 1887, by Mrs. F.L. Gillette, et al., had the following menu: oysters on half shell, cream of chicken soup, fried smelts, sauce tartare, roast turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, baked squash, boiled onions, parsnip fritters, olives, chicken salad, venison pastry, pumpkin pie, mince pie, Charlotte russe, almond ice cream, lemon jelly, hickory nut cake, cheese, fruits and coffee.\n\nA Thanksgiving Day dinner served to the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935 included: pickles, green olives, celery, roast turkey, oyster stew, cranberry sauce, giblet gravy, dressing, creamed asparagus tips, snowflake potatoes, baked carrots, hot rolls, fruit salad, mince meat pie, fruit cake, candies, grapes, apples, clams, fish, and many other food harvests. French drip coffee, cigars and cigarettes.\n\nSugar, among other food commodities, was rationed from 1942 to 1946. In 1947, as part of a voluntary rationing campaign, the Harry Truman Administration attempted to promote \"Poultryless Thursdays,\" discouraging Americans from eating poultry or egg products on Thursdays. Because Thanksgiving is always on a Thursday, this meant that turkey and pumpkin pie, two Thanksgiving staples, were discouraged, not only for that holiday, but for Christmas and New Year's Day as well, since those holidays landed on Thursday in 1947. (Pumpkin pie was discouraged because it contained eggs.) The National Poultry and Egg Board furiously lobbied the President to cease promoting the plan; it culminated in a truce at the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation shortly before Thanksgiving. Turkey was no longer forbidden, but Eggless Thursdays remained for the rest of the year, meaning no pumpkin pie was served at the White House dinner that year.\n\nTurkey is the most common main dish of a Thanksgiving dinner, to the point where Thanksgiving is sometimes colloquially called “Turkey Day.” In 2006, American turkey growers were expected to raise 270 million turkeys, to be processed into five billion pounds of turkey meat valued at almost $8 billion, with one third of all turkey consumption occurring in the Thanksgiving-Christmas season, and a per capita consumption of almost . The Broad Breasted White turkey is particularly bred for Thanksgiving dinner and similar large feasts; its large size (specimens can grow to over 40 pounds) and meat content make it ideal for such situations, although the breed must be artificially bred and suffers from health problems due to its size.\n\nMost Thanksgiving turkeys are stuffed with a bread-based mixture and roasted. Sage is the traditional herb added to the stuffing, along with chopped celery, carrots, and onions. Other ingredients, such as chopped chestnuts or other tree nuts, crumbled sausage or bacon, cranberries, raisins, or apples, may be added to stuffing. If this mixture is prepared outside the bird, it may be known as dressing. Deep-fried turkey is rising in popularity due to its shorter preparation time, but carries safety risks.\n\nThe consumption of turkey on Thanksgiving is so ingrained in American culture that each year since 1947, the National Turkey Federation has presented a live turkey to the President of the United States prior to each Thanksgiving. These turkeys were initially slaughtered and eaten for the President's Thanksgiving dinner; since 1989, the presented turkeys have typically been given a mock pardon to great fanfare and sent to a park to live out the rest of their usually short natural lives.\n\nNon-traditional foods other than turkey are usually served as the main dish for a Thanksgiving dinner. Ham is often served alongside turkey in many non-traditional households. Goose and duck, foods which were traditional European centerpieces of Christmas dinners before being displaced, are now sometimes served in place of the Thanksgiving turkey. Sometimes, fowl native to the region where the meal is taking place is used; for example, an article in \"Texas Monthly\" magazine suggested quail as the main dish for a Texan Thanksgiving feast. John Madden, who appeared on television for the NFL Thanksgiving Day game from 1981 to 2001, frequently advocated his fondness for the turducken, deboned turkey, duck and chicken nested inside each other then cooked. In a few areas of the West Coast of the United States, Dungeness crab is common as an alternate main dish, as crab season starts in early November. Similarly, Thanksgiving falls within deer hunting season in the Northeastern United States, which encourages the use of venison as a centerpiece. Vegetarians or vegans may have a tofu, wheat gluten or lentil-based substitute; or stuffed squash. In Alaskan villages, whale meat is sometimes eaten.Irish immigrants have been known to have prime rib of beef as their centerpiece since beef in Ireland was once a rarity; families would save up money for this dish to signify newfound prosperity and hope. Many Italian-Americans will serve capon as the main course to the Thanksgiving meal. \n\nIn the United States, a globalist approach to Thanksgiving has become common with the impact of immigration. Basic \"Thanksgiving\" ingredients, or the intent of the holiday, can be transformed to a variety of dishes by using flavors, techniques, and traditions from their own cuisines. Others celebrate the holiday with a variety of dishes particularly when there is a crowd to be fed, guests' tastes vary and considering the financial means available.\n\nMany offerings are typically served alongside the main dish—so many that, because of the amount of food, the Thanksgiving meal is sometimes served midday or early afternoon to make time for all the eating, and preparation may begin at dawn or on days prior. Copious leftovers are also common following the meal proper.\n\nTraditional Thanksgiving foods are sometimes specific to the day, such as riced potatoes, and although some of the foods might be seen at any semi-formal meal in the United States, the meal often has something of a ritual or traditional quality. Many Americans would say it is \"incomplete\" without cranberry sauce, stuffing or dressing, mashed potatoes and gravy, and brussels sprouts. Other commonly served dishes include winter squash and sweet potatoes, the latter often prepared with sweeteners such as brown sugar, molasses, or marshmallows. Fresh, canned, or frozen corn is popular and green beans are frequently served; in particular, green bean casserole, a product invented in 1955 by the Campbell Soup Company to promote use of its cream of mushroom soup, has become a Thanksgiving standard. A fresh salad may be included, especially on the West Coast. Bread rolls or biscuits and cornbread, especially in the South and parts of New England, are served. For dessert, various pies are usually served, particularly pumpkin pie, though apple pie, mincemeat pie, sweet potato pie, cherry pie, chocolate pie, and pecan pie are often served as well.\n\nThere are also regional differences as to the stuffing or dressing traditionally served with the turkey. The traditional version has bread cubes, sage, onion and celery. Southerners generally make their dressing from cornbread, while those in other parts of the country make stuffing from white, wheat or rye bread as the base. One or several of the following may be added to the dressing/stuffing: oysters, apples, chestnuts, raisins, and sausages or the turkey's giblets.\n\nOther dishes reflect the region or cultural background of those who have come together for the meal. For example, Sauerkraut (among those in the Mid-Atlantic; especially Baltimore) is sometimes served. Many African Americans and Southerners serve baked macaroni and cheese and collard greens, along with chitterlings and sweet potato pie, while some Italian-Americans often have lasagne on the table and Ashkenazi Jews may serve noodle kugel, a sweet dessert pudding. Other Jewish families may consume foods commonly associated with Hanukkah, such as latkes or a sufganiyah; the two holidays are usually in close proximity and on extremely rare occasions overlap. It is not unheard of for Mexican Americans to serve their turkey with mole and roasted corn. In Puerto Rico, the Thanksgiving meal is completed with arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas) or arroz con maiz (rice with corn), pasteles (root tamales) stuffed with turkey, pumpkin-coconut crème caramel, corn bread with longaniza, potato salad, roasted white sweet potatoes and Spanish sparkling hard cider. Turkey in Puerto Rico is stuffed with mofongo. Cuban-Americans traditionally serve the turkey alongside a small roasted pork and include white rice and black beans or kidney beans. Vegetarians or vegans have been known to serve alternative entree centerpieces such as a large vegetable pie or a stuffed and baked pumpkin or tofu substitutes. Many Midwesterners (such as Minnesotans) of Norwegian or Scandinavian descent set the table with lefse. \n\nThe beverages at Thanksgiving can vary as much as the side dishes, often depending on who is present at the table and their tastes. Spirits or cocktails sometimes may be served before the main meal. On the dinner table, unfermented apple cider (still or sparkling) or wine are often served. Pitchers of sweet tea can often be found on Southern tables . Beaujolais nouveau is sometimes served; the beverage has been marketed as a Thanksgiving drink since the producers of the wine (which is made available only for a short window each year) set the annual release date to be one week before Thanksgiving beginning in 1985, and it is said to pair well with the wide variety of food served for Thanksgiving dinner. Thanksgiving marks the beginning of eggnog season.\n\n\nyy"}

Thousands of dedicated shops in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka sell nothing but sweets.\n\nSugarcane has been grown in the Indian subcontinent for thousands of years, and the art of refining sugar was invented there 8000 years ago (6000 BCE) by the Indus Valley Civilisation. The English word \"sugar\" comes from a Sanskrit word \"sharkara\" for the refined sugar, while the word \"candy\" comes from Sanskrit word \"khaanda\" for the unrefined sugar– one of the simplest raw forms of sweet. Over its long history, cuisines of the Indian subcontinent developed a diverse array of sweets. Some claim there is no other region in the world where sweets are so varied, so numerous, or so invested with meaning as the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn the diverse languages of the Indian subcontinent, sweets are called by numerous names, one common name being \"Mithai\" (मिठाई, মিঠাই, ). They include sugar, and a vast array of ingredients such as different flours, milk, milk solids, fermented foods, root vegetables, raw and roasted seeds, seasonal fruits, fruit pastes and dry fruits. Some sweets such as \"kheer\" are cooked, some like \"burfi\" are baked, varieties like \"Mysore pak\" are roasted, some like \"jalebi\" are fried, others like \"kulfi\" are frozen, while still others involve a creative combination of preparation techniques. The composition and recipes of the sweets and other ingredients vary by region. \"Mithai\" are sometimes served with a meal, and often included as a form of greeting, celebration, religious offering, gift giving, parties, and hospitality in the Indian subcontinent. On South Asian festivals – such as Holi, Diwali, Eid, or Raksha Bhandan – sweets are homemade or purchased, then shared. Many social gatherings, wedding ceremonies and religious festivals often include a social celebration of food, and the flavors of sweets are an essential element of such a celebration.\n\nAncient Sanskrit literature from India mention feasts and offerings of \"mithas\" (sweet). Rigveda mentions a sweet cake made of Barley called apūpa, where barley flour was either fried in ghee or boiled in water, and then dipped in honey. Malpua preserves both the name and the essentials of this preparation. One of the more complete surviving texts, with extensive descriptions of sweets and how to prepare them, is the (; meaning in Sanskrit, the delight of an idea, or delight of mind and senses). This ancient encyclopedia on food, music and other Indian arts is also known as the (the magical stone that fulfils desires). \"Mānasollāsa\" was composed about 1130 CE, by the Hindu King Somesvara III. The document describes meals that include a rice pudding which are called \"payasam\" (Sanskrit: पायसं) in languages of the Indian subcontinent is called \"kheer\". The document mentions seven kinds of rice.\n\"Mānasollāsa\" also describes recipes for \"golamu\", a donut from wheat flour that is scented with cardamom; \"gharikas\", a fried cake from black gram flour and sugar syrup; \"chhana\", a fresh cheese and rice flour fritter soaked in sugar syrup that the document suggests should be prepared from strained curdled milk mixed with buttermilk; and many others. \"Mānasollāsa\" mentions numerous milk-derived sweets, along with describing the 11th-century art of producing milk solids, condensed milk and methods for souring milk to produce sweets.\n\nThe origin of sweets in the Indian subcontinent has been traced to at least 500 BCE when, records suggest, both raw sugar (\"gur\", \"vellam\", jaggery) and refined sugar (sarkara) were being produced. By 300 BCE, kingdom officials in India were acknowledging five kinds of sugar in official documents. By the Gupta dynasty era (300–500 CE), sugar was being made not only from sugar cane, but from other plant sources such as palm. Sushruta Samhita records about sugar being produced from mahua flowers, barley (yavasa) and honey and Sugar-based foods were also used in temple offerings as \"bhoga\" for the deities which, after the prayers, became \"prasād\" for devotees, the poor, or visitors to the temple.\n\nAdhirasam is a sweet similar to a doughnut originating from Tamil Cuisine made from rice flour, jaggery, butter and pepper..\n\nBarfi is a sweet made from milk solids (khoya) or condensed milk and other ingredients like ground cashews or pistachios. Some barfi use various flours such as besan (gram flour). Barfi may be flavored with pastes or pieces of fruit such as mango, banana, berries, or coconut. They may also include aromatic spices such as cardamom and rose water to enhance the overall flavor.\n\nSometimes a thin layer of silver or gold edible foil is placed on top of \"burfi\" for an attractive presentation. Gold and silver are approved food foils in the European Union, as E175 and E174 additives respectively. The independent European food-safety certification agency, TÜV Rheinland, has deemed gold leaf safe for consumption. Gold and silver leaf are certified kosher. These inert metal foils are neither considered toxic to human beings nor the broader ecosystem.\n\nChomchom is a traditional Bengali sweet, prepared from flattened \"paneer\" (a form of curdled milk solids, cheese) sweetened in syrup.\n\nChhena murki, or chenna murki, is a sweet made from an Indian version of cottage cheese, milk and sugar in many states such as Odisha. Milk and sugar are boiled to a thick consistency and round, cube, cuboid or other shapes of cottage cheese are soaked in the milky condensate. The sweet originated in the coastal areas in the district of Bhadrak and nowadays is available in all parts of Odisha. Other flavors and aromatic spices are typically added. It is also known by Bengali and Guyanese people as pera.\n\nChhena Poda is a cheese dessert from the state of Odisha in eastern India. 'Chhena poda' literally means 'burnt cheese' in Odia. It is made of well-kneaded homemade cottage cheese or chhena, sugar, cashew nuts and raisins, and is baked for several hours until it browns. The best quality of Chhena Poda is found in the localities of Nayagarh District in Odisha.\n\nChikki is a ready-to-eat solid, brittle sweet generally made from casting a mix of dry nuts and hot jaggery syrup. Peanuts and jaggery mix are most common. Other than almonds, cashews, walnuts, sesame and other seeds, varieties of chikki are also prepared from puffed or roasted Bengal gram, puffed rice, beaten rice, puffed seasonal grains, and regional produce such as Khobara (desiccated coconut). Like many Indian sweets, Chikki is typically a high protein delicacy.\n\nGajrela, also called \"Gajar halwa\", is a seasonal pudding-like sweet made from carrots. It is popular in the Punjab regions of India, the agricultural belt of North India, and now common in many parts of the Indian subcontinent. It is made by slowly cooking shredded carrots with ghee, concentrated and caramelized milk, mawa (khoya) and sugar; it is often served with a garnish of aromatic spices, almonds, cashews or pistachios. The recipes vary by region. Gajrela may be cooked without ghee and can include cheese or other milk solids for a sophisticated mix of flavors. It is common in Indian and Pakistani restaurants and is a seasonal street and cafe food served during the post-monsoon season through to spring festive celebrations.\n\nGulab jamun is a common sweet found in the Indian subcontinent. It is made out of fried \"chenna\" (milk solids and cheese) balls soaked in sweet rose-water flavoured syrup.\n\nJalebi is made by deep-frying a fermented batter of wheat flour with yoghurt, in a circular (coil-like) shape and then soaking it in sugar syrup. Imarti is a variant of Jalebi, with a different flour mixture and has tighter coils. Typically Jalebi is brown or yellow, while Imarti is reddish in colour. The sweet is often enjoyed with milk, tea, yogurt or Lassi. In classical Sanskrit literature, \"jalebis\" have been referred to as \"kundalika\" or \"jalavallika\".\n\nKesari Bhath is a sweet dish made of semolina, sugar, ghee. Its origins are attributed to Kannada cuisine.\n\nKhaja is a sweet of India. Refined wheat flour, sugar, and oils are the chief ingredients of khaja.\n\nIt is believed that, even 2000 years ago, Khaja was prepared in the southern side of the Gangetic Plains of Bihar. These areas, which are home to the sweet, once comprised the central part of the Maurya and Gupta empires. Presently, Khajas are prepared and sold in the city of Patna, Gaya and several other places across the state of Bihar. Khajas of the Silao and Rajgir are known for their puffiness.\n\nKhajas have traveled to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, including Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The Khaja of Kakinada, a coastal town of Andhra Pradesh, is famous in South India and Orissa. This Khaja is dry on the outside and full of sugar syrup on the inside. The Khaja of Puri is also very famous. Khajas are made by first mixing a batter of wheat flour, mawa and oil. The batter is then deep fried until crisp. Next, a sugar syrup is made which is known as \"pak\". The crisp croissants are finally soaked in the sugar syrup until they absorb the liquid.\n\nKheer is a pudding, usually made from milk, sugar and one of these ingredients: vermicelli, rice, bulgur wheat, semolina, tapioca, dried dates, or shredded white gourd. It is also known as \"payas\". \"Phirni\" is a popular variant of kheer.\n\nA sweet rice pudding, payas has been a cultural dish throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent and is usually served during ceremonies, feasts and celebrations. In many parts of India, ancient traditions maintain that a wedding is not fully blessed if payas (or payasam as known in South India) is not served at the feast during traditional ceremonies like marriage, childbirth, annaprasan (first solid feed to child), and other occasions. Other than sweet yogurt, some families serve kheer during the last meal, as auspicious food, before a family member or guest departs on a long journey away from the home.\n\nKozhukatta is a traditional sweet dumpling originating from Indian Tamil cuisine. It is made up of thickened rice flour and variations of the filling may include using coconut, jaggery or sugar. It is closely associated with modak.\n\nKulfi is traditional South Asian ice-cream. It is made using flavored milk that is first condensed and caramelized by slow cooking along with a small quantity of rice or seasonal grain flour; once condensed, dry nut pastes and aromatic spices are added and the mix frozen in small earthen or metal cans. This creates a dense form of frozen dessert; it is typically served between −10 to −15 °C when it is easier to spoon and eat. Kulfi comes in a variety of flavors such as mango, kesar, pistachios, \"badam\" (almond), coconut and plain. It is also a street side summertime snack and festive sweet, which food hawkers carry around in a big earthen pot and play a particular horn music to attract customers. These vendors are known as \"kulfiwalla\" (those who sell kulfi).\n\nLaddu (sometimes transliterated as laddoo or laadu) is made of varieties of flour, grains, pulses, semolina, regional or seasonal fruits, dry fruits, and other ingredients cooked with sugar. These are then shaped into bite-size or larger spheres. Laddu is mentioned in ancient Sanskrit documents as temple offerings, and is referred to as \"ladduka\". It is popular all over India, is easy to prepare, and comes in dozens of varieties. Laddu is often served during festivals, religious ceremonies, or household events such as weddings.\n\nOne example of laddu is \"motichoor ka ladoo\". It is a sweet food popular in states like Bihar. It is made from roasted gram flour flakes which are sweetened, mixed with almonds, rolled into a batter and then cast into mini balls and fried in ghee. Every mini ball, called \"boondi\", melts like a fresh sweet. The mini balls are combined with aromatic spices and then formed into bite-size spheres, which are called \"motichoor ka ladoo\". With each bite, the mini balls distribute a burst of flavor throughout the mouth. Other examples include \"Tirupati laddu\", so popular that over a million \"laddu\" are distributed every week from a single temple of Lord Venkateswara.\n\nMalpoa is homemade sweet popular in India. It is a form of deep fried pancake (made of wheat or rice flour) that is soaked in sugar syrup.\n\nNarikel Naru is a ball-shaped sweet from Bengal. It is made from condensed milk and coconut and is served during Kojagori Lakshmi Puja, Poush Parbon (Makar Sankranti), and several other occasions.\n\nParwal Ki Mithai is a dry sweet made of parwal, a gourd-like vegetable. The shell of the parwal is filled with milk solids and then cooked. It is popular in Bihar, but is also found in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.\n\nPathishapta is a Bengali dessert. The final dish is a rolled pancake that is stuffed with a filling often made of coconut, milk, cream, and jaggery from the date palm. These desserts are consumed in Thailand as well.\n\nA sweet dish traditionally made on Pongal, the Tamil harvest festival.\n\nRasgulla is a popular sweet in the Indian subcontinent. It comes in many forms, such as \"Kamalabhog\" (orange rasgulla), \"Rajbhog\" (stuffed with dry fruits and khoya inside), \"Kadamba\" (often served with \"kheer\"), and \"Rasamundi\", \"Raskadamba\". Some are white in color while others are cream, brown, gold or orange. They are called \"Rasbari\" in Nepal. This dish is made by boiling small dumplings made of a mixture of \"chhenna\" and semolina in sugar syrup. Once cooked, these are stored in the syrup, making them spongy. Increasing the semolina content reduces the sponginess of the dessert and hardens them, creating a variety of textures. Some \"Rasgulla\" are stuffed inside with treats, such as dry fruits, raisins, candied peel, and other delicacies to create a variety of flavors. Some versions, called \"danedhar\", are removed from the syrup and sugar-coated into different fruit shapes and other creative designs. These are festive foods found year-round in many parts of India.\n\n\"Ras malai\" or \"rosh malai\" is a dessert eaten in the Indian subcontinent. The name \"ras malai\" comes from two words in Urdu/Hindi: \"ras\", meaning \"juice\", and \"malai\", meaning \"cream\". It has been described as a rich cheesecake without a crust. Ras malai consists of sugary white cream or yellow-coloured (or flattened) balls of paneer soaked in malai (clotted cream) flavoured with cardamom.\n\nSandesh is a sweet made of fine cow's milk cheese kneaded with fine ground sugar or molasses. This is a sweet from West Bengal and Odisha. Revered as a delicacy and appreciated by the connoisseur, sandesh represents sweet-making at its finest. Sandesh comes in two varieties, \"Norom Pak\" (the softer version) and \"Koda Pak\" (the harder version). The softer version, although more popular, is fragile. The harder version is robust and often easier to store. Molasses made from dates can be used to make a special variation of Sandesh called \"Noleen Gurher Sandesh\" (a Sandesh made from \"Noleen Gurh\" or molasses from dates) or simply \"Noleen Sandesh\".\n\nSel roti is a Nepali home-made circular-shaped bread or rice donut that is prepared during Tihar, a widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal and India (Sikkim and Darjeeling regions). It is made of rice flour and incorporates customized flavors. A semi liquid rice flour dough is usually prepared by adding together milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, cloves as well as other flavors based on personal choice.\n\nShrikhand is a creamy dessert made out of strained yogurt, from which water is drained off completely. Dry fruits, mango puree, saffron or cardamom, and sugar are added to the thick yoghurt to get the desired flavour and taste. It is served chilled. It is a traditional West Indian dish.\n\nOther traditional Indian sweets and desserts famous throughout the history of Indian food include:\n\n\n"}

As a title of sovereignty the term under the Roman Republic had all the associations of the Greek \"Tyrannos\"; refused during the early principate, it finally became an official title of the Roman Emperors under Diocletian (this is where the term \"dominate\", used to describe a political system of Roman Empire in 284-476, is derived from). Dominus, the French equivalent being \"sieur\", was the Latin title of the feudal, superior and mesne, lords, and also an ecclesiastical and academical title. The ecclesiastical title was rendered in English \"sir\", which was a common prefix before the Reformation for parsons, as in Sir Hugh Evans in Shakespeare's \"Merry Wives of Windsor\". In the past, the academical use was for a Bachelor of Arts. The shortened form \"Dom\" is used as a prefix of honor for ecclesiastics of the Catholic Church, and especially for members of the benedictine and other religious orders.\n\nFor women, a Domina, in old English Law, was a title formerly given to noble ladies who held a barony in their own right. At the University of Cambridge, the honorific 'Domina' (abbreviated as Dna) is given to women who hold a Bachelor of Arts degree, but not a master's degree. From \"mea domina\", \"my lady,\" through French \"madame,\" comes \"madam\", and the contracted form \"ma'am.\"\n\nThe honorific \"Dom\", and its feminine form \"Dona\" (both abbreviated as \"D.\") is also a title of honor in Portugal, as formerly in Brazil, used by members of the blood royal and others on whom it has been conferred by the sovereign.\n\nThe Spanish form \"Don\" is also a title, formerly applicable only to the nobility, and now one of courtesy and respect applied to any elderly man. The feminine form \"Doña\" is similarly applied to a lady.\n\nIn Italian, the title Don or Donna is also reserved for diocesan catholic clergymen, former nobles and persons of distinction in Southern Italy.\n\nIn Romanian, the word \"Domn\" (feminine \"Doamna\") is both a title of the medieval rulers, and a mark of honor. Also, the Latin phrase \"Domine Deus\" has evolved into \"Dumnezeu\", which means \"God\".\n\nIn French, the words \"Dame\" and \"Madame\" (respectively \"Lady\" and \"Mylady\"), derived from Latin \"Domina\", are still the normal way to address a woman.\n\n"}

The grain and legume combination provide several important nutrients and many calories, and both foods are widely available. Rice and beans are vegetarian and make up a complete protein. The beans are usually seasoned, while the rice may be plain or seasoned. The two components may be combined or served separately.\n\nThe dish usually consists of white or brown rice accompanied by cooked brown, red or black, dry beans (typically \"Phaseolus vulgaris\" or \"Vigna unguiculata\") and seasoned in various ways. This dish is also commonly served with sides of stewed chicken, pork, beef, potato salad, boiled potatoes, and many other sides from many different cultures. In many areas, rice and beans are often served side by side rather than combined together. Either way, they may be considered a meal, frequently with a topping of meat or chicken. Meat or other ingredients are sometimes placed atop rice and beans or, less frequently, mixed into it.\n\nDifferent regions have different preferences. In Brazil, for example, black beans are more popular in Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, while in most other parts of the country these are mostly only used in feijoadas. The New Orleans specialty known as \"red beans and rice\" is often accompanied by a side of smoked sausage or a fried pork chop.\n\nGenetic analyses of the common bean \"Phaseolus\" shows that it originated in Mesoamerica, and subsequently spread southward, along with maize and squash, traditional companion crops. Asian rice was introduced to Mexico and Brazil during the colonial era by the Spanish and the Portuguese. However, it has recently been discovered that the indigenous peoples of the Amazon had already cultivated a distant relative of Asian rice of the same genus Oryza some 4,000 years ago, and were growing it alongside maize and squash, traditional companion crops of beans, which were also by that time present in South America. Some recent scholarship suggests that enslaved Africans may also have played an active role in the establishment of rice in the New World. It is also one of the most common foods in some Spanish speaking countries.\n\nRice and beans is very nutritious. Rice is rich in starch, an excellent source of energy. Rice also has iron and some protein. Beans also contain a good amount of iron and a greater amount of protein than rice. Together they make up a complete protein, which provides each of the amino acids the body cannot make for itself.\n\nIn some Latin American states and countries, rice and beans are commonly eaten as everyday lunch, along with a different variety of meats and vegetables. It is also common to prepare dinner using the lunch leftovers. Rice and beans are especially popular in Brazil, which is the world's third largest producer of dry beans and the largest consumer of rice in the Americas.\n\nBandeja Paisa : A colombian traditional dish made with kidney beans and rice \n\nRice and beans is referred to as \"arroz y habas\", \"arroz con habichuelas\", \"arroz con frijoles\", \"gallo pinto\", \"recalentao\" or similar in Spanish, \"arroz e feijão\", \"arroz com feijão\" or \"feijão com arroz\" in Portuguese,\"risi e bisi\" in Venetian language, \"diri ak pwa\" in Haitian Creole, \"avas kon arroz\" or \"avikas kon arroz\" in Judaeo-Spanish.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3063973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3063973", "title": "Doxa", "text": "Doxa\n\nDoxa (ancient Greek δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν \"dokein\", \"to appear\", \"to seem\", \"to think\" and \"to accept\") is a Greek word meaning common belief or popular opinion. Used by the Greek rhetoricians as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the \"doxa\" was often manipulated by sophists to persuade the people, leading to Plato's condemnation of Athenian democracy.\n\nThe word \"doxa\" picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the Septuagint translated the Hebrew word for \"glory\" (כבוד, \"kavod\") as \"doxa\". This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the early church and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of \"doxa\" as \"glory\" is made evident by the ubiquitous use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the Greek Orthodox Church, where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of orthodoxy and heterodoxy. This semantic merging in the word \"doxa\" is also seen in Russian word слава (\"slava\"), which means \"glory\", but is used with the meaning of \"belief\", \"opinion\" in words like православие (\"pravoslavie\", meaning \"orthodoxy\", or, literally, \"true belief\").\n\nIn Plato's Gorgias (dialogue), Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the \"multitude\" to their advantage without shame. In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul. This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's Theory of Forms, which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form. Plato's framing of \"doxa\" as the opponent of knowledge led to the classical opposition of error to truth, which has since become a major concern in Western philosophy. (However, in the \"Theaetetus\" and in the \"Meno\", Plato has Socrates suggest that knowledge is \"orthos doxa\" for which one can provide a \"logos\", thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as \"justified true belief\".) Thus, error is considered in Occident as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of illusion. As such, \"doxa\" may ironically be defined as the \"philosopher's sin\" . In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with \"episteme\".\n\nPlato's student Aristotle objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it. Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as \"endoxa\". Endoxa is a more stable belief than \"doxa\", because it has been \"tested\" in argumentative struggles in the \"Polis\" by prior interlocutors. The use of \"endoxa\" in the Stagirite's \"Organon\" can be found in Aristotle's \"Topics\" and \"Rhetoric\".\n\nPierre Bourdieu, in his \"Outline of a Theory of Practice\", used the term \"doxa\" to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The \"doxa\", in his view, is the experience by which \"the natural and social world appears as self-evident\". It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable (\"the universe of possible discourse\"), that which \"goes without saying because it comes without saying\". The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of \"doxa\" are to be traced in \"Distinction\" where \"doxa\" sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by \"doxa\" as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence \"doxa\" helps to petrify social limits, the \"sense of one's place\", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that \"this is not for us\" (\"ce n'est pas pour nous\"). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.\n\nDoxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.\n\nBourdieu explains the term \"doxa\" in his interview with theorist Terry Eagleton. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.\n\nFor example, Bourdieu contends that it is a socially accepted misconception that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.\n\nWhile doxa is used as a tool for the formation of argument, it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by James A. Herrick in \"The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction\": \"The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy.\" Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not homogeneous, nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing \"truths\".\nTo expand upon the quote from his \"Outline of a Theory of Practice\" in the above section, \"Use in sociology and anthropology\", Bourdieu writes, \"When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa\". Adam Smith of the University of Chicago observes in his article \"The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view\": \"Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products.\" This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.\nDoxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.\n\n"}

They are divided into two types: oil-in-water (O/W) creams which are composed of small droplets of oil dispersed in a continuous water phase, and water-in-oil (W/O) creams which are composed of small droplets of water dispersed in a continuous oily phase. Oil-in-water creams are more comfortable and cosmetically acceptable as they are less greasy and more easily washed off using water. Water-in-oil creams are more difficult to handle but many drugs which are incorporated into creams are hydrophobic and will be released more readily from a water-in-oil cream than an oil-in-water cream. Water-in-oil creams are also more moisturising as they provide an oily barrier which reduces water loss from the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin.\n\n\nCreams are semisolid dosage forms containing more than 20% water or volatile components and typically less than 50% hydrocarbons, waxes, or polyols as vehicles.

It is the best-selling tequila in the world, with a 35.1% market share of the tequila sector worldwide and a 33.66% share of the US tequila sector as of July 2013. As of 2012, Jose Cuervo sells 3.5 million cases of tequila in the US annually, and a fifth of the world's tequila by volume.\n\nJose Cuervo is family-owned and is run today by the Beckmann family of Mexico, descendants of Don Jose Antonio de Cuervo. Juan-Domingo Beckmann, son of Juan Beckmann, is the sixth-generation leader of the company. In July 2013 Proximo Spirits took over US distribution of Jose Cuervo from Diageo, which had managed it since 1997.\n\nIn 1758, Don Jose Antonio de Cuervo was issued a land grant by King Ferdinand VI of Spain in the town of Tequila, Jalisco. Here his family founded the Taberna de Cuervo, the farm where they would cultivate and harvest the flowering blue agave plant, a water-retaining plant found in central Mexico that is distilled to create tequila. The first Vino Mezcal de Tequila de Jose Cuervo was made in 1795, after Don Jose Antonio de Cuervo's son Jose María Guadalupe de Cuervo was granted a permit from King Carlos IV of Spain to produce tequila commercially, following a time of prohibition under King Carlos III. This was the birth of the tequila industry.\n\nBy 1880, the Cuervo family had begun individually bottling tequila for commercial distribution. Cuervo was the first distiller to bottle tequila, at a time when other distillers were still using barrels. Tequila was known as \"mezcal de tequila\" until 1893, when tequila makers and the Mexican government dropped \"mezcal\" from the name. Cuervo's first bottled tequila was sold in 1906.\n\nUpon the death of Don Jesus, his wife, Ana Gonzalez Rubio, inherited La Rojeña and in 1900 married Jose Cuervo Labastida, head of La Constancia. From then on, the brand became Jose Cuervo Tequila. After Ana Gonzalez Rubio's death in 1934, the estate was left to her niece Guadalupe Gallardo, who died in 1966 and left the estate to her sister, Virginia Gallardo. One of her sons, Juan Beckmann Gallardo, would manage the business. Part of Cuervo was owned by Distribuidora Bega, and, starting in 1979, the other part was owned by Grupo Cuervo, made up of Beckmann, his son Juan Beckmann Vidal, Jose Luis Campos, and Heublein Inc.\n\nAlong with Sauza, Cuervo began to dominate the tequila industry in the 1940s. Tequila first made significant inroads into the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was smuggled from Mexico into southwestern US states. Tequila made further advances in the US during World War II, when many US distilleries switched to war-related production and there were restrictions on European imports. Then, in the 1980s, more American tourists visited Mexico, discovering tequila. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, the US demand for tequila has risen over the years, with 12 million cases shipped to the US in 2012, a 54% increase as compared to a decade earlier. The fastest-growing segment has been super-premium blue agave spirits.\n\nIn 1989, the Beckmann family sold 45% of Jose Cuervo to International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), a division of Grand Metropolitan PLC. In 1997, Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness plc to become Diageo which would be Jose Cuervo's main distributor outside of Mexico until 2013. Starting in 2011, Diageo, the world's largest liquor maker, was in talks to acquire Jose Cuervo from the Beckmann family for in excess of $3 billion. After it was unable to acquire the brand, Diageo announced in December 2012 that it would end the US distribution deal. In a deal first announced in March 2013, Proximo Spirits, a company owned by the Beckmann family, took over Jose Cuervo's distribution beginning in July 2013.\n\nJose Cuervo is produced at the La Rojeña distillery in the state of Jalisco in Mexico. The distillery was officially founded in 1812. It is the oldest active distillery in Latin America. After Ana Gonzalez Rubio married Jose Cuervo Labastida in 1900, he renamed the distillery La Rojeña, and was the first to call the tequila produced there Jose Cuervo. After the death of Don Vincente, Jesus Flores (owner of the distillery now known as La Constancia) took over management of La Rojeña. He was the first to package the tequila into damajuanas (rope-encased jugs), where previously they had been stored only in wooden barrels. The damajuanas were later replaced with individual bottles, making it easier to transport the tequila across the border to America. The company shipped its first export of three bottles across the border in 1873.\n\nIn order for a spirit to be called tequila, it must come from the blue agave plant, a species found only in Jalisco and four nearby regions in central Mexico. All Jose Cuervo tequila continues to be made in the town of Tequila in the state of Jalisco in Mexico.\n\nThe blue agave plant has spiked leaves and a round, fleshy core (the piña). The leaves are chopped off and the core is cooked and crushed to create juice, which is fermented and distilled to make tequila. The resulting unaged, clear tequila is then diluted with water to bring the alcohol content down to around 40%. Pure tequila is distilled 100% from the sap of the blue agave plant, while mixto tequilas only need to be at least 51% blue agave in order to legally be called tequila. In 1964, tequila makers were allowed to obtain up to 30% of the sugars in tequila from sources other than the agave plant. During a blue agave shortage in the 1970s, Mexican regulations were further revised to require that tequila contain only 51.5% agave. Agave plants take 10 to 12 years to mature and become ripe, while sugarcane can be harvested every year, so blending the agave spirit with sugarcane spirit is a cheaper method, while using 100% blue agave plant is more expensive.\n\nThe Jose Cuervo Express train was opened to visitors in February 2012 to help promote tourist development in the Jalisco area. The train travels 60 kilometers from Guadalajara to Tequila, taking 2 hours to journey through the agave fields and past volcanoes. Upon arrival in Tequila, guests are able to take a tour of the Jose Cuervo factory and La Rojeña distillery.\n\nTequila is naturally clear after fermentation and distillation are complete. This type is callled “blanco” or “white”. “Plata” or “silver” on the other hand, despite its color being the same as “blanco”, is an aged version of tequila which got decolorized after being kept in barrels for months or years.\n\nAfter the fermentation and distillation processes, tequila can then be aged in oak barrels, giving it a golden hue. There are three variations of gold tequila. Reposados have a pale amber color, as they typically spend 2 to 12 months in oak barrels. Añejos have a darker gold color and more flavor contributions from the barrel, as they are typically aged 1 to 3 years in oak barrels. Extra añejo, which has an even darker color and richer flavor, is 100% blue agave and aged more than three years. The occasionally smoky flavors of extra añejo tequilas have been compared to those typically found in brandy and scotch. The extra añejo designation for tequilas aged more than three years was approved by Mexico's National Committee on Standardization in 2006.\n\nCuervo Especial products are mixto tequilas. Especial Silver is an unaged white tequila containing at least 51% agave, with the remainder being made up of sugarcane spirit.\n\nEspecial Gold (commonly referred to as \"Cuervo Gold\") is a blend of reposado and younger tequilas of at least 51% agave, with caramel coloring added to the finished product to give it the gold color, also known as joven tequila.\n\nIn 2013, Proximo launched Jose Cuervo Cinge, a cinnamon-infused 35% abv version of Especial Silver. It is one of many cinnamon-infused liquors on the market. See Fireball and discussion therein.\n\nCuervo's Tradicional has been produced since 1795. Its varieties, Silver and Reposado, are 100% agave tequilas. The reposado achieves its amber color through six months of barrel aging. Silver was launched in 2011.\n\nCuervo Black was a mixto añejo tequila that included sugar cane spirit, aged one year in oak barrels. It was named on \"Bloomberg Businessweek\"'s 2009 list of the world's 20 best-tasting tequilas. It is no longer available.\n\nPlatino is 100% agave, handcrafted using a proprietary process in which the steam is recaptured to bring in more flavor before the tequila is chill-filtered. It was named on \"Bloomberg Businessweek\"'s 2009 list of the world's 20 best-tasting tequilas, and awarded the Beverage Tasting Institute's highest rating, Superlative.\n\nReserva de la Familia was introduced in 1995 as a high-end offering of 100% blue agave tequila, matured in the La Rojeña distillery's private cellars. Its first edition sold out weeks after its release. Reserva de la Familia is classified as an extra añejo tequila, meaning it is 100% agave aged over three years in an oak barrel, giving it a deeper golden color with a richer flavor more typically tasted in scotch or brandy. It would become Cuervo's first extra añejo offering after the high-end distinction was created in 2005. It was named on \"Bloomberg Businessweek\"'s 2009 list of the world's 20 best-tasting tequilas, and on a list of the 18 best tequilas in the world in \"Men's Journal\" in 2013.\n\nCuervo offers several pre-made margaritas. The Authentic Margarita and Light Margarita varieties contain Cuervo Gold and are 9.95% alcohol by volume. Golden Margarita contains Grand Marnier liqueur along with Cuervo Gold, and is 12.7% abv. The Margarita Mix does not contain any alcohol.\n\n1800 Tequila, owned by Jose Cuervo and previously labeled Cuervo 1800 before being distributed by Proximo Spirits starting in 2008, is a 100% agave tequila, available in various silver, reposado and añejo varieties.\n\n\nIn 1979, Jose Cuervo became beach volleyball's first major sponsor. After the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) tour folded in 2010, the Jose Cuervo Pro Beach Volleyball Series was launched in 2011 by IMG and USA Volleyball with three events across the US, and upped the number to seven in 2012. With the return of the AVP tour in 2013, the Cuervo Series was not continued.\n\nCuervo Gold is referred to in Steely Dan's song \"Hey Nineteen\", on their album \"Gaucho\", released in 1980. The lyric is, \"The Cuervo Gold / The fine Colombian / Make tonight a wonderful thing.\"\n\nIn 1978, after a stint as a poster girl for Jose Cuervo Tequila, Cindy Jordan wrote a country song titled \"Jose Cuervo\", the first song she ever wrote. The song references the tequila in the lyrics, \"Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine.\" Recorded by Shelly West in 1983, it was named \"Billboard\" magazine's 1983 Country Song of the Year after reaching number 1 on the \"Billboard\" country songs chart.\n\nThe song \"Ten Rounds with Jose Cuervo\" by country music artist Tracy Byrd documents a man's night drinking Cuervo after his girlfriend breaks up with him. It reached number 1 on the \"Billboard\" country songs chart in 2002. Other country songs that mention the liquor are \"The Dope Smokin' Song\" by Hank Flamingo and \"Drink Canada Dry\" by David Allan Coe.\n\nIn the 2004 MMORPG game \"World of Warcraft\", there are some items referencing Jose Cuervo, like \"Cuergo's Gold\" and \"Hozen Cuervo\".\n\nCuervo Silver is shown to be enjoyed on multiple occasions on the Showtime series \"Dexter\" (2006–13).\n\nA moody 2013 ad campaign for Cuervo Especial starred actor Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nBeyoncé references Jose Cuervo on her 2016 song \"Formation\", from her album \"Lemonade\", with the line, \"I twirl on my haters, albino alligators / El Camino with the seat low, sippin’ Cuervo with no chaser.\"\n\n"}

It was introduced internationally in 1981.\n\nPrego offers many different varieties. The traditional pasta sauce is available in nineteen different flavors including marinara, traditional, mini meatball, zesty mushroom, and roasted garlic Parmesan. In Prego's Organic line, two flavors (Organic Mushroom and Organic Tomato and Basil) are made with all organic ingredients. A third line in the Prego Pasta Sauce family is called Hearty Meat sauce. It comes in Meatball Parmesan, Authentic Italian Sausage, and Three Meat Supreme flavours. Yet another line is called Chunky Garden Pasta Sauce which consists of flavors such as Garden Combination, Mushroom Supreme, Mushrooms & Green Pepper, and Tomato, Onion & Garlic. In Asia, specific regional flavors are available, including Tom Yam in Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nPrego was the result of efforts in the 1970s by Campbell's Soup to expand its work with tomatoes beyond the soup business. Although senior management originally wanted to create a product to directly attack Heinz (which had sued Campbell's Soup over unfair business practices) the company had no competitive advantage producing ketchup. On the other hand, Campbell's R&D group and Chef Werner Schilling developed a process to allow thick tomato sauce to be mass-produced without \"weeping\" (separation of water from the solids). The other major companies in the pasta sauce market, Ragu and Hunt's, used starch to achieve thickness, which limited the appeal of store bought sauce for families who wanted a sauce comparable to home made. As a result of the anti-weeping innovation and smart marketing, Prego became one of the most successful grocery product launches of the early 1980s. In 2017, William M. Hildebolt, the R&D lead on Prego's development who went on to become VP of Research and Development at Campbell's, published a history of Campbell Soup and the development of Prego called, \"It's in There!\"\n\nIn 1986 after growth had leveled off, Campbell's Soup consulted with Howard Moskowitz, a practitioner in the field of psychophysics. His process involved the development of variations of ingredients in the formula. After placing numeric values to testers' perception on variants, a model was created to modify recipes, maximizing perceived taste while minimizing costs. Moskowitz' work systematized the process Schilling and Hildebolt had run with taste-testers during initial product development. As a result of that work, Schilling's initial recipe was materially sweetened just prior to launch, reflecting consumers' growing preference for sugary flavors and contributing to the product's immediate blockbuster success.\n\nPrego achieved over $100 million in sales and 28% market share in its first year, an astonishing accomplishment for a food brand entering an established market. Beyond the product innovations, Prego's marketing was also considered extraordinary with credit given to Laurel Cutler of Leber Katz who was brought in very early during the product's development, and Herb Baum, a Campbell's marketing director at the time, who backed an aggressive marketing and roll-out plan over the objections of other executives.\n\nThe brand was involved in a commercial controversy when it featured Clara Peller in one of its ads. The elderly woman was shown holding a gigantic prop jar of one of the meaty varieties of Prego, saying, \"I finally found it!\" It was a reference to her earlier work in ads for Wendy's Restaurants and the catchphrase, \"Where's the beef?\" Wendy's had not authorized her appearance in the Prego commercial and stopped using Peller in its campaigns.\n\n"}

'Curds and Whey' is an archaic term for junket.\n\nTo make junket, milk (usually with sugar and vanilla added) is heated to approximately body temperature and the rennet, which has been dissolved in water, is mixed in to cause the milk to set. The dessert is chilled prior to serving. Junket is often served with a sprinkling of grated nutmeg on top.\n\nFor most of the 20th century in the eastern United States, junket was often a preferred food for ill children, mostly due to its sweetness and ease of digestion.\n\nThe same was true in the United Kingdom where, in medieval times, junket had been a food of the nobility made with cream, not milk, and flavoured with rosewater and spices as well as sugar. It started to fall from favour during the Tudor era, being replaced by syllabubs on fashionable banqueting tables and, by the 18th century, had become an everyday food sold in the streets.\n\nIn the United States, junket is commonly made with a packaged mix of rennet and sweetener from a company eponymously known as Junket.\n\nDorothy Hartley, in her \"Food in England\", has a section on rennet followed by a section on 'Junkets, Curds and Whey or Creams'. She cites rum as the most common flavouring, and clotted cream as the 'usual accompaniment'. She notes that the practice of heating the milk to blood heat is a new one; originally, junket was made with milk as it was obtained from the cow, already at blood heat.\n\nThe word's etymology is uncertain. It may be related to the Norman \"jonquette\" (a kind of cream made with boiled milk, egg yolks, sugar and caramel), or to the Italian \"giuncata\" or directly to the medieval Latin \"juncata\". The first recorded use in this sense is in \"The boke of nurture, folowyng Englondis gise\".\n\nElizabeth David, in an article in \"Nova\", dated October 1965, asserts that the word \"junket\" derives from the French \"jonches\", a name for freshly made milk cheese drained in a rush basket.\" The article can be found in the collection \"An Omelette and a Glass of Wine\" originally published in London by R. Hale Ltd, 1984. See the chapter titled \"Pleasing Cheeses,\" Page 206.\n\nJunket brand rennet custard mix was popular in the United States in the 1960s. Today, it is one of many \"legacy\" brands still in production, in this case, where there is no true competitor making rennet custard. The brand is owned and made by Redco Foods of Little Falls, New York, a company more famous for its tea products under its other \"legacy\" brands Red Rose and Salada, all owned by Düsseldorf, Germany-based Teekanne, GmbH.\n"}

The word \"Mahorero\" (\"Majorero\") is a Guanche word still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura. This island has a rich farming tradition, and goats were very important to their economy. It is from the Majorera goat that this particular cheese is made. The goat produces a thick, aromatic and high-fat milk.\n\nMajorero cheese is usually available in three ways: in its natural rind rubbed with oil, rubbed with pimenta, or with roasted gofio. The cheese has a slightly gummy texture. The taste is acidic, with a buttery but not salty taste. This cheese is very versatile, and can be used with pastas, potatoes and many vegetables.\n\nAfter milking, lamb rennet is added and after an hour a curdle develops. This curdle must be beaten and drained to remove the whey. The cheese is then heavily pressed and shaped. Dry salt is rubbed on the top. The cheese must be aired for several days before it can be eaten, or it can be set in dry rooms to age.

The term \"salva\" was also applied to the dish or tray on which the food or drink was presented after the tasting process.

{"id": "3087164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3087164", "title": "Muraqabah", "text": "Muraqabah\n\nMurāqabah (ar. to observe) refers to meditation in Sufi terminology. Through murāqbah a person watches over their (spiritual) heart and gains insight into the heart’s relation with its creator and its own surroundings. Murqābah is a core concept in commonly found \"ṭarīqas\" (ar. sufi orders). The objective of murāqbah is to purge one's base characters and develop lofty character in its place.\n\nThe word murāqabah is derived from the base of rā-qāf-bāʿ. The base has the meaning of guarding and watching over with the expectation of noticing any change, unique qualities or abnormalities of a given thing. The word is also on verb scale three, which gives a connotation of exaggeration, overexertion, and partnership. This then implies that the one who is doing murāqabah is diligent and hardworking with the expectation that someone else is also doing a similar task.\n\nIn ancient Arabic, the word murāqabah referred to one who would watch the night sky. They would scan the sky in hopes to see the first signs of early stars to begin their journey. Due to the intense heat and difficult terrain of the Arabian Peninsula, the ability to recognize the constellations and their seasonal divergences was a critical skill. In the classic poem, “the observer of the night is as vigilant as a fish in search of water”.\n\nThis etymology can be connected to the modern linguistical and technical meaning of what murāqabah is understood to be today. Murāqabah is seen to be of twin perspectives, both with a connotation of persistence and exertion. According to al-Qushayrī (d.465/1072) and al-Jurjānī (d.816/1413) murāqabah is for one to be aware that their lord is perpetually aware of his subordinates. Not only is the person continuously in a state of mindfulness but they are also cognizant that their lord is aware as well, creating a reciprocal relation.\n\nOne of the most significant sentiments of the great philosopher and theologian Al-Ghāzālī (d.505/1111) centers around God-consciousness; he propagates that it is the obligation of the creation to be in constant awareness of its Creator. That is to constantly obey him. The Creator’s eternal knowledge encompasses the ephemeral existence of mortals, from before their conception to the ages after they have passed on. His Knowledge envelops the external, the internal and the metaphysical. He is the lord and creator. Once one understands this, they must follow a level of etiquette and protocol which are but not limited to:\n\nHaving humility (ar. tawāḍuʾ) and modesty (ar. ḥayāʿ)\n\nStaying silent and only speaking when appropriate, as it is mentioned in the narration, “the one who believes in Allah and the last day should only speak good or stay quiet”.\n\nResolve to do the best that one can in every action.\n\nRush to do good deeds and avoiding sin.\n\nTo be content with what one must deal with daily (ar. al-raḍāʿ bi al-qaḍāʿ).\n\nContinuous reflection on one’s internal state and world around them. \n\nStanding up for the truth.The physical benefits of murāqabah is akin to the benefits of standard meditation. Metaphysically speaking, the intended result of murāqabah is to refrain from any actions contrary to What is obligatory. and ultimately maintain one’s mindfulness in a state that one’s Lord finds them (in state of mindfulness) where He is pleased with them and not one where he is displeased with them.\n\nTo continue to progress in murāqabah one must be consistent for a lengthy period of time to experience the aforementioned benefits. Although it may prove difficult in the beginning, one may always regain their state of mindfulness after recognizing a change from their initial state.\n\nHere are the \"Maqāmāt\" (Arabic: مقامات stages) in which Sufis have broadly categorised their journey of ascension. The categorization is an arbitrary one, and each level is generally further divided into several sublevels. During the process of enlightenment, some stages can merge or overlap each other.<br>\nThis is the starting level of meditation. A person who starts meditation often enters a somnolent or sleep state (\"ghanood غنود\"). With the passage of time, the person goes into a state between sleep and wakefulness. The person can remember seeing something but not specifically what it is.\n\n(Arabic: إدراك - cognition) With continuous practice of meditation, the sleepiness from meditation decreases. When the conscious mind is not suppressed by sleep and is able to focus, the person can receive the spiritual knowledge from his subconscious mind. At this stage, the person is unable to see or hear anything but is able to experience or perceive it.\n\n(Arabic: ورود coming, beginning) When \"Idrāk\" (experience) becomes deep, it is exhibited as sight. The stage of \"Wurūd\" starts when mental concentration is sustained and somnolence is at its minimum. As soon as the mind is focused, the spiritual eye is activated. The conscious mind is not used to see through the spiritual eye so concentration comes and goes. Gradually, the mind gets used to this kind of visions, and the mental focus is sustained. With practice, the visions/experience becomes so deep that the person starts considering himself a part of the experience rather than considering himself an observer.\n\nKashf or ʾlhām(Arabic: كشف/الهام unveiling of arcane knowledge or intuition) is the stage of starting to get information that most other people are unable to observe. In the beginning, this occurs suddenly, without personal control. With practice, the mind gets so energized that it can get this knowledge by will.\n\n(Arabic: شهود evidence) A person can get any information about any event/person at will. This stage is broadly categorized according to activation of the senses:\n\n(Arabic: فتح opening, victory) Closing eyes is no longer necessary for meditation. The person is freed from both space and time and can see/hear/taste/touch anything present anywhere in time and space.\n\n(Arabic: فناء extinction, annihilation) Through a series of stages (\"maqamat\") and subjective experiences (\"ahwal\"), this process of absorbation develops until complete annihilation of the self (\"fana\") takes place, and the person becomes \"al-insanul-kamil\", the \"perfect man\". It is the disintegration of a person's narrow self-concept, social self and limited intellect (feeling like a drop of water aware of being part of the ocean). The stage is also called \"Fana fit tawheed\" (\"extinction with the unity\"), and \"Fana fil Haq\" (Extinction in the reality).\n\n(Arabic: سيرٌ الى الله journey towards the God) The person starts his spiritual journey towards the ultimate reality of the universe, God. It is also called \"Safr-e-Urooji\".\n\n(Arabic: فناء في الله Extinction of the self in God) One of the important phases of mystical experience is attained by the grace of God by a traveller on the mystical path. Now, the person becomes extinct in the will of God. It is important to mention that this is not incarnation or union. Most Sufis passing through this experience have preferred to live in the greatest depth of silence, which transcends all forms and sounds and to enjoy their union with the beloved.\n\n(Arabic: سير من الله journey from the God) Here the person comes back to his existence. It is also called \"Safr-e-Nuzooli\".\n\nNo one can subsist with God, and to believe as such is shirk. What really happens is the person's awareness of God increases so much so that he forgets his own self and is totally lost in his magnificence.\n\n(Arabic: بقاء بالله eternal life in God The Creator) This is the state in which man comes back to his existence and God appoints him to guide the humans. The individual is part of the world but unconcerned about rewards or position in the world. The doctrine is further explained in Sahih Bukhari, which states that God said: \nThere is another verse from Qur'an that is used to explain this concept:\n\nWhen Sufis have come out of the \"Fana fillah\" state and enter \"Baqa billah\", many of them have produced works of unsurpassed glory, especially in the fields of philosophy, literature and music. Such works have crowned the culture of the entire Islamic world and inspired Sufis and non-Sufis for generations. As the great Persian Sufi poet, Hafez of Shiraz, fondly remembered as the \"tongue of the unseen\", said centuries ago: \"He whose heart is alive with love, never dies\". The \"Qur'an\" says:\n\nThere are many different kinds of \"muraqaba\" practiced in various Sufi schools in different parts of the world. Here is a list of the most common ones.\n\n\n\n\nThe Naqshbandi Mujaddidi order has 35 lessons.They are all related to getting closer to Allah and receiving faiz and nur. \n\n\n"}

Tripe, which is the stomach lining of a cow, is sometimes an ingredient in the filler of an andouillette, but it is not the casing or the key to its manufacture. True andouillette will be an oblong tube. If made with the small intestine, it is a plump sausage generally about 25 mm in diameter but often it is much larger, possibly 7–10 cm in diameter, and stronger in scent when the colon is used. True andouillette is rarely seen outside France and has a strong, distinctive odour related to its intestinal origins and components. Although sometimes repellent to the uninitiated, this aspect of andouillette is prized by its devotees.\n\nThe original composition of \"andouillette sausages\" is not known and there is no record of the andouillette's composition from earlier than the nineteenth century. Nineteenth century dictionaries simply describe them as \"small andouilles\" (\"\").\n\nDuring recent decades, a range of differently composed andouillettes are or have been offered by charcuterie producers: the principal differences concern the primary ingredients used, whether pork or veal or a mixture of the two. During the twenty-first century the incorporation of veal, historically the more costly meat ingredient, has been banned in response to concerns over BSE. Some French regions such as (the area surrounding Cambrai) and Lyonnais were still including veal right up to the ban. In other regions, pork has been the only meat in an andouillette for more than a century: that is the case with the andouillette \"of Troyes\", which is currently the type of andouillette most likely to be encountered in national outlets, such as supermarkets, throughout France. But it seems likely that through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, local producers were using their own unique recipes according to time and place: the recipes used by local specialised outlets continue to vary considerably.\n\nA number of andouillettes sold as local specialities have nevertheless evolved or indeed disappeared, such as the andouillettes of Villers-Cotterêts which received a mention in the posthumously published Culinary Dictionary (\"Grand Dictionnaire de cuisine\") by Alexandre Dumas.\n\nAndouillettes can be served either hot or cold, with the former much more common. As with all lower intestine sausages, andouillettes are to some extent an acquired taste. Their smell may offend people unaccustomed to the dish. The texture is somewhat rougher than most sausages, as the content is coarsely cut. Primarily pan-fried (sometimes breaded), it can also be boiled, barbecued or grilled. The sausage is often served with vegetables (primarily onions) in a mustard or red wine sauce.\n\nIt is a common dish all over France but some regions are well known for their own recipes. The most famous ones come from Troyes, Lyon, Cambrai and Chablis and are graded using the AAAAA (5 As) grading system.\n\nThe Association Amicale des Amateurs d'Andouillette Authentique (AAAAA) 'The Friendly Club of Lovers of Authentic Andouillette' is a club formed by several food writers in 1970. It gives certificates (\"diplôme\") to producers of high-quality andouillettes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3089396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3089396", "title": "Cassata", "text": "Cassata\n\nCassata or Cassata siciliana is a traditional sweet from Sicily, Italy. Cassata consists of round sponge cake moistened with fruit juices or liqueur and layered with ricotta cheese and candied fruit, a filling also used with cannoli. Cassata has a shell of marzipan, pink and green coloured icing, and decorative designs. Cassata may also refer to a Neapolitan ice cream containing candied or dried fruit and nuts.\n\nCassata is believed to have originated in Palermo in the 10th century, when under Muslim rule. The Arabic name al-Qassāṭỉ \" القشاطي \" (Arabic for 'cassata-maker') is first mentioned in Corleone in 1178 The Arabic word \"qas'ah\", from which cassata may derive, refers to the bowl that is used to shape the cake.\n\nHistorian John Dickie claims that the Sicilian word \"cassata\" did not derive from Arabic \"qashatah\" \" قشاطة \" (\"bowl\"), as is often claimed, but from \"caseata\" (\"cheese concoction\") Dickie observes that \"cassata\" did not signify a dessert until the late 17th century and did not take on its current striped form until the 18th century. \"Cassata\" he finds, \"is the subject of an invented tradition based on the claim that its roots lie in the Muslim Middle Ages. Many other local food traditions purport to be as old.\"\n\nUnlike the round, traditional shape some cassata are made in the form of a rectangle, square, or box. The word \"box\" in Italian is \"cassa\", although it is unlikely that the word \"cassata\" originated from this term.\n\n\"Cassata Catanese\", as it is often prepared in the Sicilian province of Catania, is made similar to a pie, containing a top and bottom crust, filled with ricotta, and baked in the oven.\n\nThe \"Cassatella di Sant'Agata\" (\"pl.\" cassatelle)—colloquially named Minni di Vergini, meaning \"virgin breasts\"—is a similar dessert, but made in a smaller, personal-serving size, with a candied cherry on top, and often a specifically green-coloured marzipan. It is typically made in Catania for the festival of Saint Agatha. The allusion to the female breast relates the specific torture Saint Agatha faced as a Catholic martyr.\n\nWhen a cassata is made, layers of gelato (Italian ice cream) can be substituted for the layers of cheese, producing a dessert similar to an ice cream cake. The version of the recipe followed in Messina is less sweet than the one used in Palermo.\n\"Cassata\" can also refer to a flavor of ice-cream inspired by the sweet.\n\nIn and around Northeast Ohio, particularly in the Cleveland area, the term \"cassata cake\" refers to a sponge cake soaked in syrup or rum, filled with strawberries and custard, and covered with sweetened whipped cream. This Cleveland version of the cassata first appeared in the early 1920s at LaPuma Spumoni & Bakery in Cleveland. The children of the owners did not like traditional cassata cake, made with sweetened ricotta, chocolate chips, and candied fruit. Using what they had in the bakery, Tomasso LaPuma created what was to become known as the Cleveland cassata cake. The fifth generation of this bakery, now located in the city's eastern suburb of Chesterland, still continues to make the original version of this cake, as do many other Italian bakeries in the area.\n\nIn Portland, Oregon cassata has come to mean a cake soaked with coffee liqueurs and espresso, due mainly to it being offered on the menu of only one establishment in the area. This version is made using Kahlua and espresso, with sweet ricotta and bittersweet chocolate shavings. The variation differs from most recipes by having no fruit flavors or ingredients in the cake itself, and instead incorporating the more bitter coffee flavors the Pacific Northwest is known for, though it is usually served with a berry reduction.\n\nIn India, 'cassata' refers to a layered ice cream, similar to Neapolitan ice cream, with three flavors, usually pistachio, vanilla, and strawberry, on a base of sponge cake, topped with chopped nuts.\n\n"}
{"id": "3089403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3089403", "title": "Adana kebabı", "text": "Adana kebabı\n\nAdana kebabı (colloquially known as Kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled on an open mangal filled with burning charcoal. The culinary item is named after Adana, the fifth largest city of Turkey and was originally known as the \"Kıyma kebabı\" (lit: minced meat kebab) or Kıyma in Adana-Mersin and the southeastern provinces of Turkey.\n\nKebabs are usually made out of ground lamb meat and tail fat, though there are many regional variations. Kebabs are fairly common in the area from Mersin in Turkey to Kirkuk in Iraq, and includes Aleppo in Syria. According to many authors, this kebab was born out of a fusion of Turkish and Arab cultures. Birecik, once an important locality in the Eyalet of Aleppo, is said to be the creator of this very kind of kebab. The version prepared and consumed today in the province of Adana also has a history rooted in the modern Turkish culture, only to receive a \"Controlled Designation of Origin\" in February 2005, after subsequent legal trials.\n\nAccording to the Patent Registrar, an original \"Adana kebabı\" is made only by a vendor who has successfully passed an inspection conducted on the spot by the Adana Chamber of Commerce. A substantive list of these establishments can be found here.\n\nThe \"Kıyma kebabı\" is still prepared in its historical location. Similar dishes are prepared in neighboring zones of Turkey, Syria and Iraq, where the meat is hand-ground with the addition of tail fat and occasionally a non-spicy capsicum. \n\nNew variants of the Kıyma kebabı, not protected under the same patents, have been enjoyed since the 1950s, in communities in the former Ottoman Empire territories, including Istanbul, Baghdad, and Damascus. These versions are adapted to the local tastes and cannot be considered the original Kıyma kebabı:\n\n\nAccording to the Designation of Origin, Adana kebabı is made from the meat of a male lamb that is younger than one year of age. The animal has to be grown in its natural environment and fed with the local flora.\n\nThe meat should then be cleansed of its silverskin, nerves and internal fat. After the cleansing, it should be cut into rough shanks and, along with tail fat at a proportion of one to five, be laid to rest for a day.\n\nThe next day, the rested meat and fat must be ground by hand, using a crescent-shaped iron cleaver known as the \"\"Zırh\"\". Only sweet red peppers (also hand chopped with the Zırh) and salt should be added. The Designation of Origin also authorizes, \"under certain circumstances\", the addition of spicy green capsicum and fresh garlic cloves.\n\nThe meat will then be thoroughly kneaded together with the fat, the salt and the additional ingredients until reaching a homogenous consistency.\nAfter reaching homogeneity, the mixture is placed on iron skewers that are 0.5 cm thick, 3 cm wide and anywhere from 90 to 120 cm long. One portion of \"Adana kebabı\" is typically 180 grams of meat on one skewer. A \"\"portion-and-half\"\", impaled on slightly wider skewers can not include less than 270 grams, as per the designation label.\n\nA little water allows the minced meat to adhere better to the skewer, which is the hardest step in the making of this kebab. If not done properly by an \"Usta\", the meat will separate from the skewer during roasting.\n\nThe impaled skewers are roasted over flame-less coals of oak wood. When the meat turns dark brown, it is ready. The skewers are frequently turned during this process. The melting fat is collected on flatbread by pressing pieces of flatbread against the meat as it roasts; this also serves to heat the bread.\n\nThe kebab is commonly served on a plate, as a \"\"Porsiyon\"\", or wrapped in flatbread, as a \"\"Dürüm\"\".\n\nThe kebab is served over the flatbread used to catch the drippings. It is accompanied by roasted tomatoes, green or red peppers and julienned onions with parsley and sumac. Other typical mezes in Adana-Mersin served with the kebab include red pepper ezme with pomegranate molasses, fresh mint and tarragon leaves, braised shallot hearts with olive oil and pomegranate molasses, pickled small green chili peppers, and, around Mersin, green shallot stems with slices of bitter orange, citron, lime and lemon. Many restaurants around Adana will also bring hot hummus with butter topped with pastırma on the side.\n\nThe way to eat \"\"Porsiyon\"\" is to skin and crush the charred tomatoes and peppers into a paste, to put them in a piece of flatbread with part of the kebab, topped by a generous pinch of the onion-sumac-parsley mixture, and to wrap the whole thing into a few small thick dürüms.\n\nAyran and Şalgam are two staple beverages consumed with kebab in daytime. On hot summer evenings, ice-cold Rakı alongside Şalgam is often preferred.\n\nThe browned kebab is taken out of the mangal, removed from the skewer and placed on top of a large loaf of flatbread (mostly lavaş or tırnak pidesi), topped by a pinch of julienned onions, small diced tomatoes, some parsley, then sprinkled with a little salt, cumin and sumac and finally wrapped into a long roll. Ayran is more commonly consumed with dürüm compared to the Şalgam.\n\nMany variations of the \"Kıyma kebabı\", all based on hand-chopped lamb meat and tail fat, are found around the Cilician and Mesopotamian parts of the former Ottoman Empire.\n\nSome notable regional examples are:\n\n\n\n\nAdana kebab, has been celebrated as a festival in Adana since 2010. Adana Kebab and Şalgam Festival, emerged from a hundred-year tradition of enjoying kebab, with liver, şalgam and rakı. The event turned into a nationwide popular street festival, street musicians playing drums and zurna, entertain visitors all night long at the second Saturday night of every December.\n\n\n"}

This type of pongal is also made during Pongal festival in Tamil Nadu.\n\nIngredients can include rice, coconut and mung bean.

{"id": "3093748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3093748", "title": "Chindia", "text": "Chindia\n\nChindia is a portmanteau word that refers to China and India together in general. The credit of coining the now popular term goes to Indian Member of Parliament Jairam Ramesh. China and India share long borders, are both regarded as growing countries and are both among the fastest growing major economies in the world. Together, they contain over one-third of the world's population (nearly 2.7 billion). They have been named as countries with the highest potential for growth in the next 50 years in a BRIC report. BRIC is a grouping acronym that refers to the countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China.\n\nThe economic strengths of these two countries are considered complementary, in particular China is perceived to be strong in manufacturing and infrastructure while India is perceived to be strong in services and information technology. Both countries are relatively underdeveloped and require improvements in these areas in order to be technologically competitive with developed economies.\n\nChina is stronger in hardware while India is stronger in software. China is stronger in physical markets while India is stronger in financial markets. The countries also share certain historical interactions – the spread of Buddhism from India to China and British-European trade on the Silk Road are famous examples. Additionally, China's needs are changing as the economy matures, its acute focus on energy is lessening as energy prices plunge, renewables energy comes online, and major energy producers ramp up. At the same time, China's need for markets for its manufacturing base is growing especially as overcapacity issues bite and US and Japan are intent on wrestling away markets in favor of other less developed nations via trade pacts like Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nHowever, there are also geopolitical, cultural, economic, linguistic and political differences between China and India that imply the term has a weak association. The effects of the Sino-Indian War of 1962 have meant that relations between the countries have been cautious and slow, but perhaps more importantly, the geographic barrier that the Himalayas represent provide potent mutual isolation. Indeed, the core of both civilizations, the Indo-Gangetic plain and the Central China Plain lies thousands of miles away across extremely inhospitable terrain. As such, direct ties and exchanges have languished, shockingly even in Nov 2015 in spite of both Modi's \"Act East\" policy and China's One Road One Belt push, still only 5 direct daily flights exist between the two giants, reflecting just how far the gulf between the two countries really is. It is often overlooked the role Southeast Asia has played in stitching together the two collections of cultures, both historically and contemporaneously.\n\nPolitically, China can be characterized as a single party authoritarian state whereas India is a democracy of hundreds of political parties. India's culture can be characterized by a high degree of pluralism whereas China has a more ethnically homogeneous population, though the concept of Han ethnicity is itself challenged. The commonly cited complementary nature of China and India's economies is also being questioned as the service sector in China is rapidly growing, while India's manufacturing sector has seen rapid growth in recent years. China also has a head start in international marketplaces and is a large investor in Africa. There is also the belief that China has greater geopolitical clout than India as well as a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nAdditionally, China's massive infrastructure investments into Pakistan rather than India suggest the concept of Chindia(n) integration may be pre-mature and/or politically inconvenient.\n\nIt is seen at present for both India and China to overcome major and mutual challenges such as regional and societal income disparities, moving up the value chain towards greater innovation, and also environmental degradation for Chindia to prosper and actually take effect in future.\n\nSerious difficulties in attempting to find a mutually acceptable settlement for a 2520 miles (4056 km) frontier has been a major stumbling block between the two countries ever since India's independence in 1947. Technical discussions have been going on for decades. They will continue. The difference is that these discussions are now coupled with the leaders' firm pledge to find a peaceful solution.\n\nChina and India are the most populous countries in the world, with well over a billion people each, and barriers to their mutual isolation are coming down as China races to develop and hold on to Tibet, meanwhile India is countering with its own policies to hold on to underdeveloped fringe areas, especially the Northeast and Himalayan areas. Additionally the developments in neighboring countries, such as the political and economic opening up of Myanmar, are sparking ideas regarding regional connectivity.\n\nChina is seen to assert its global leadership. Many countries in the world are now counting on China to lead the recovery from the recent US economic crisis and the European debt crisis. China has also shown leadership ambitions through proposing an alternative reserve currency to the US dollar and extending yuan swap lines to several Asian and even non-Asian states.\n\nCitigroup predicts that the economies of China and India will have surpassed that of the United States by 2030.\n\nToday, China and India are producing some of the world's best-trained computer science and electrical engineering graduates.\n\n\n"}

A Qawwali performance usually includes at least one Hamd, which is traditionally at the beginning of the performance.\n\nIn the five pillars of Islam, the concept of Hamd is in each pillar to emphasize the importance of this word. In the first pillar Shahada, Muslims praise Allah for the blessings of being born Muslim and the belief in one god and his prophet. They also praise Him for giving them better health and wealth than those who suffer. The second pillar is Salat which is performing prayer, Muslims pray five times a day in order to keep remembering Allah and this allows a direct link between the worshipper and God. In each prayer Muslims recite Surah (passage), Al-Fatiha and choose the next surah they would like to recite, but Al-Fatiha must always be recited in order for prayers to be accepted. The third pillar is giving Zakat which is the act of giving a percentage of a Muslim's income to certain classes of needy people; this allows Muslims to remember the poor and to never forget that everything belongs to Allah. Therefore they should be thankful for what they have at all times. Fasting is the fourth pillar, and this emphasizes the depth meaning of Hamd in the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims fast every year for a month from sunrise to sunset. This helps purify the worshiper's soul and helps them gain true sympathy with the hungry in addition to remind them of their blessings and amounts of food they have. The fifth pillar is Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the concept of Hamd is implemented in the action of Muslims visiting the Kaabah or House of God. In all five pillars in Islam, Hamd is used either by action or words.\nIn all aspects of Islam, Hamd is used and can only be used for Allah alone. Hamd is the root word for AlHamdAllah which means praise to Allah. When a Muslim thanks or praises Allah for his favours and bounties it can be done by reciting the word or by act of prayer.\n\nHamd is a word to be recited by every Muslim in order for him/her to keep Allah in mind. For example, when a Muslim sneezes, first thing they should say is HamdAllah praising God in every small or large situation. It is believed when a person sneezes, his or her soul is taken out for milliseconds and returned, therefore thanking God for returning the soul is a blessing. Muslims should always praise God no matter what state they are in. \nHamd is always true and implies admiration, love and magnifying the creator. Hamd is sincere and true praise therefore when praising Allah most deserving; called Mahmood which comes from the word Hamd. When Muslims say \"AlHamdAllah\", it is out of love, humility and complete submission to the oneness and perfection of Allah.\n\nSome well-known Hamd singers are Mishary Rashid Alafasy, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sabri Brothers, Najam Sheraz, Qari Waheed Zafar Qasmi and Muhammad al-Muqit. Some modern English language singers of Hamd are Yusuf Islam (formerly known as Cat Stevens), Sami Yusuf, Ahmed Mac and \"Nusrullah Khan Noori\". Hamd is a word that is used in the Islamic religion. Muslims use the word Hamd in many aspects in their lives. The Quran starts with a Hamd opening chapter or Surah which is Al-Fatiha starts with praising God (\"Allah\"). It is found to be in the first Ayah, the first Surah in the Quran; Al-Fatiha . It is significant because it allows Muslims to remember (\"Allah\") throughout the day and to keep praising Him for his blessings.\n\n\n"}

It was originally a cheaper alternative to high-price red hot dogs, made of the less desirable meat parts and various fillers; in contrast, modern versions are made from quality meats and are generally sold at higher prices than common hot dogs.\nOne of the best-known producers of the white hot is Zweigle's. Although they were not the first to make white hots, they were the first to secure a contract at the Red Wing Stadium soon after Zweigle's began making the dogs in 1925.

Jain cosmology postulates an eternal and ever-existing loka which works on universal natural laws, there being no creator and destroyer deity. According to the Jain cosmology, the universe is divided into three parts:\n\n According to Hindu cosmology, the universe contains 7 upper and 7 lower planes of existence.\n\nIn the Puranas and in the Atharvaveda, there are 14 worlds, seven higher ones (\"Vyahrtis\") and seven lower ones (\"Pātālas\"), viz. \"bhu\", \"bhuvas\", \"svar\", \"mahas\", \"janas\", \"tapas\", and \"satya\" above and \"atala\", \"vitala\", \"sutala\", \"rasātala\", \"talātala\", \"mahātala\", \"pātāla\" and \"naraka\" below. \nThe scholar Deborah Soifer describes the development of the concept of lokas as follows: \nThe concept of a loka or lokas develops in the Vedic literature. Influenced by the special connotations that a word for space might have for a nomadic people, \"loka\" in the Veda did not simply mean place or world, but had a positive valuation: it was a place or position of religious or psychological interest with a special value of function of its own. Hence, inherent in the 'loka' concept in the earliest literature was a double aspect; that is, coexistent with spatiality was a religious or soteriological meaning, which could exist independent of a spatial notion, an 'immaterial' significance.\nThe most common cosmological conception of lokas in the Veda was that of the trailokya or triple world: three worlds consisting of earth, atmosphere or sky, and heaven, making up the universe.\"\n\nIn early Buddhism, based upon the Pali Canon and related Agamas, there are four distinct worlds: There is the Kama Loka, or world of sensuality, in which humans, animals, and some devas reside, Rupa-Loka, or the world of refined material existence, in which certain beings mastering specific meditative attainments reside, and Arupa Loka, or the immaterial, formless world, in which beings to master formless meditative attainments reside. Arahants, who have attained the highest goal of Nibbana (or, Nirvana), have unbound themselves from individual (limited) existence in any form, in any realm, and cannot be found here, there, or in between, i.e., they are found in no Loka whatsoever.\n\nIn the Tibetan and Tantric schools, \"Six Lokas\" refers to a Bönpo and Nyingmapa spiritual practice or discipline that works with chakras and the six dimensions or classes of beings in the Bhavachakra. And in Buddhist Cosmology Kama-Loka, Rupa-Loka, Arupa-Loka has interpreted.\n\nThe concept of Lokas was adopted by Theosophy, and can be found in the writings of Blavatsky and G. de Purucker. There is also reference to kamaloka (world of desires) as a sort of astral plane or temporary after-life state, according to the teachings of Blavatsky, Leadbeater, and Steiner.\n\nThe Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) refer to \"seven heavens\" and \"seven earths\"\n\nThe Qur'an frequently mentions the existence of seven \"samaawat\" (سماوات), plural of \"samaa'a\" (سماء), which is customarily translated as 'heaven'.

It is often garnished with \"gremolata\" and traditionally served with either \"risotto alla milanese\" or polenta, depending on the regional variation. The marrow in the hole in the bone, a prized delicacy, is the defining feature of the dish.\n\nThe two types of \"ossobuco\" are a modern version that has tomatoes and the original version which does not. The older version, \"ossobuco in bianco\", is flavoured with cinnamon, bay leaf, and \"gremolata\". The modern and more popular recipe includes tomatoes, carrots, celery and onions; \"gremolata\" is optional. While veal is the traditional meat used for ossobuco, dishes with other meats such as pork have been called ossobuco.\n\n\"Ossobuco\" or \"osso buco\" is Italian for \"bone with a hole\" (\"osso\" \"bone\", \"buco\" \"hole\"), a reference to the marrow hole at the centre of the cross-cut veal shank. In the Milanese variant of the Lombard language, this dish's name is \"òss bus\".\n\nThis dish's primary ingredient, veal shank, is common, relatively cheap, and flavorful. Although tough, braising makes it tender. The cut traditionally used for this dish comes from the top of the shin which has a higher proportion of bone to meat than other meaty cuts of veal. The shank is then cross-cut into sections about 3 cm thick.\n\nAlthough recipes vary, most start by browning the veal shanks in butter after dredging them in flour, while others recommend vegetable oil or lard. The braising liquid is usually a combination of white wine and meat broth flavored with vegetables.\n\n\"Risotto alla milanese\" is the traditional accompaniment to \"ossobuco in bianco\", making for a one-dish meal. \"Ossobuco\" (especially the tomato-based version, prepared south of the Po River) is also eaten with polenta or mashed potatoes. South of the Po River, it is sometimes served with pasta.\n\n"}

They are aimed at children and widely consumed in the United Kingdom. Flavours include Roast Beef, Pickled Onion and Flamin' Hot.\n\nMonster Munch snacks were launched in Britain in 1977 by Smiths. Originally called \"The Prime Monster\" (a play on \"The Prime Minister\", and as part of a wider campaign), they were renamed \"Monster Munch\" in 1978. Advertised as \"The Biggest Snack Pennies Can Buy\" – in reference to the large size of the snacks – each pack featured a different monster on the front of the packet.\n\nThe snack was supported by a \"Monster Munch Club\", whose members received a \"Monster Munch Munchers\" membership pack which included a membership card, pen, several story books, and a story tape which included six \"tall stories\" and accompanying songs.\n\nBy the late 1980s there were four main monsters featured on the packaging, although originally a total of six featured in the advertising.\nThe original flavour for Monster Munch when it launched was Roast Beef followed on by Saucy and Pickled Onion flavours a year later. In the 1980s flavours such as Sizzling Bacon, Cheese & Onion, King Prawn and Salt & Vinegar were introduced. By the 1990s the four flavours available were Pickled Onion, Roast Beef, Smokey Bacon and Saucy.\n\nThe original Monster Munch used two different snack shapes, related to two of the Monsters. The shape known as a \"monster paw\" that is still used today has long been the subject of dispute over whether it represents a paw or, instead, the single eye and lashes of Yellow monster (currently seen on Pickled Onion flavour packs). The other represented the gangly, long-tongued Pink Monster: circular with two bumps on the top for eyes, protrusions on either side and a tongue dangling down. For a limited time in the early 1990s, there were also spider-shaped Monster Munch in the Sizzling Bacon flavour.\n\nA short-lived range of Monster Munch themed drinks - Monster Fizz - was available in the 1980s. The small range of flavours included orangeade, cola and lemonade.\n\nIn 1994, Mega Monster Munch was introduced, which came in bigger bags in Flamin' Hot flavour.\n\nIn 1995 the Monster Munch brand was taken over by Walkers who relaunched them with a range of four flavours. One of the most significant changes was that the crisps were much smaller than before. The monster characters were also redesigned.\n\nAlongside the returning Pickled Onion and Flamin' Hot (Mega Monster Munch only), two new flavours, Beef Burger and Spaghetti Sauce, were introduced. A wide range of Tazos, featuring images of the monsters, was produced, with one Tazo included in each bag.\n\nSince then, various packaging changes and new flavours have been introduced. Monster Munch was later part of Walkers' short lived \"Snackshack\" lineup during 1997-1999. A Cheesy flavour replaced the Spaghetti Sauce Flavour at this time, and the Blue Monster was recoloured Yellow. Flamin' Hot was later introduced in the multipacks at this time, replacing Beef Burger.\n\nIn 1999, when Walkers changed their logo, Monster Munch changed their packaging. A Spicy flavour was also released at this time and a new Purple Monster (which looked like the Pink Monster from the first era) was the main monster for that flavour. in 2003, Cheesy and Spicy were discontinued, the Spicy flavour was replaced with Roast Beef again.\n\nIn 2007, Walkers changed the packaging for all their snack products, which were Quavers, Wotsits, Squares, French Fries and Monster Munch. This packaging reflected the usage of Sunseed Oil, which was used in all products. The Multipack bags were in a different layout, being in Landscape style. For Monster Munch, the logo was changed, but the monsters and flavours didn't. However, for Monster Munch, This packaging style was short lived, as huge changes happened to the brand in 2008. This packaging remained for the short lived Baked Monster Munch.\n\nIn September 2008 Walkers re-launched Monster Munch, based on the original Monster Munch from the Smiths days. The crisps have returned to their original larger size, and the packs include retro designs based on the original packs, featuring three of the original four monsters. \"Roast Beef\" flavour features the Pink Monster as originally, \"Pickled Onion\" features the Yellow Monster and \"Flamin' Hot\" is marketed with the Blue Monster. The orange monster was not brought back.\nA Mega Monster Munch website was launched to coincide with the relaunch.\nThroughout the years there have been several limited edition flavours available for a short period of time. A \"Baked Bean\" flavour was made available in 2003 for Comic Relief. A \"Vanilla Ice Cream\" flavour was released in 2004, and was received with mostly negative reaction. This type of monster munch was non-savoury, and it contained sugar instead of salt. There has been a flavour called “bolognaise sauce” which was a tomato and beef taste available in the mid 1990s and was eventually replaced with the current “Flamin’ Hot” variety\n\nThere were also variants that could turn the consumer's tongue a different colour. This usually meant the tongue was turned blue, though a variant that could turn the tongue either blue or green was available for a time.\n\nA Product Called \"Mega Monster Munch Webs\" was sold starting from Halloween in 2013 and came in a bacon flavour. This product has been popular enough to be released every Halloween after that.\n\nIn Ireland, the major potato crisp and corn snack brand Tayto made a spicy flavoured corn snack with the name \"Monster Munch\". Upon the movement of Walkers into the Irish market in the 1990s, the name \"Monster Munch\" was purchased from Tayto. Thereafter, Tayto changed the name of their snack to \"Mighty Munch\" to differentiate between the Tayto and Walker snacks.\n\nIn France, the major potato crisp brand Intersnack (France) commercializes a range of flavoured potato chip based snacks with the name \"Monster Munch\". The range of flavours includes ready salted, ham & cheese, barbecue, ketchup and cream cheese. The monsters are smaller in size than UK Monster Munch, much thinner with a smiling ghost shape.\n\nMonster Munch is suitable for vegetarians.\n"}
{"id": "3124337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3124337", "title": "Nachlass", "text": "Nachlass\n\nNachlass (, older spelling Nachlaß) is a German word, used in academia to describe the collection of manuscripts, notes, correspondence, and so on left behind when a scholar dies. The word is a compound in German: \"nach\" means \"after\", and the verb \"lassen\" means \"to leave\". The plural can be either \"Nachlasse\" or (with Umlaut) \"Nachlässe\". The word is not commonly used in English; and when it is, it is often italicized or printed in capitalized form to indicate its foreign provenance.\n\nThe Nachlass of an important scholar is often placed in a research library or scholarly archive. Other workers in the scholar's area of specialization may obtain permission to comb through the Nachlass, seeking important unpublished scholarly contributions or biographical material. The content of a Nachlass can be catalogued, edited, and in some cases published in book form.\n\nSuch publication is more difficult for a Nachlass that contains a great deal of material, such as that of Gottfried Leibniz. In such cases, it may not be financially possible to publish its entire contents. The Nachlass of Ludwig Wittgenstein, kept at the University of Bergen, has been digitized and published in compact disc format.\n\nKlagge and Nordmann note a conflict that faces an editor choosing what to publish draft material from a Nachlass: to understand a scholar (in this case Wittgenstein) \"as he would want to be understood, we should focus on the works that came closest to passing muster with him.\" Yet publication of draft material may perhaps assist in a deeper understanding of the published versions, and also help understand the process whereby the scholar created his or her works.\n\nSometimes it is known what the original scholar's view was concerning what should be done with his or her Nachlass, and these views differ greatly. Near the end of his life Gottlob Frege wrote to his adopted son:\n\nFrege's wishes probably went unfulfilled: his Nachlass, although duly archived in the library of the University of Münster, is believed to have been destroyed in 1945 by an Allied bombing raid during the Second World War.\n\nThe philosopher Edmund Husserl developed a strong commitment to his Nachlass (which included about 40,000 pages of sketches) during the last years of his life, allowing his colleagues to sort and classify it. Bernet, Kern, and Marbach suggest that because Husserl had difficulty in putting his thoughts into a definitive, publishable form, he accordingly attached great importance to the survival of his notes. In fact, because Husserl was of Jewish ethnicity and died in Germany in the year 1938, his Nachlass only narrowly escaped destruction under the Nazi regime.\n\nAlfred North Whitehead, in contrast, asked that his Nachlass be destroyed, a wish that his widow carried out. According to Lowe (1982), Whitehead \"idealized youth and wanted young thinkers to develop their own ideas, not spend their best years on a Nachlass.\" Gilbert Ryle likewise disapproved of scholars spending their time editing a Nachlass. According to Anthony Palmer, he \"hated the Nachlass industry and thought that he had destroyed everything of his that he had not chosen to publish himself so that there would be no Ryle \"Nachlass\".\" (\"One or two\" papers (Palmer) did survive, however, and were published.)\n\nHenri Bergson's Nachlass was destroyed by his widow at his request. Lawlor and Moulard suggest that the destruction of Bergson's papers, by depriving later scholars of the stimulation of examining a Nachlass, actually affected his posthumous standing: \"The lack of archival material is one reason why Bergson went out of favor during the second half of the Twentieth Century.\"\n\n\n\nUse of the word in German is not limited to academic contexts. It is frequently used to refer to the entirety of a person's estate after they died, usually in the context of inheritance.\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, they are adjectives or adverbs, but can also consist of clauses such as one use of tag questions. It could be regarded as a form of euphemism. Hedges are considered in linguistics to be tools of epistemic modality; allowing the speaker to signal his or her degree of confidence in a connected assertion. Hedges are also used to distinguish items into multiple categories, where items can be in a certain category to an extent.\n\nHedges may take the form of many different parts of speech, for example:\n\n\nIn some cases, \"\"I don't know\"\" functions as a prepositioned hedge—a forward-looking stance marker displaying that the speaker is not fully committed to what follows in their turn of talk.\n\nHedges may intentionally or unintentionally be employed in both spoken and written language since they are crucially important in communication.

As a meal, landjäger sausage can be boiled and served with potatoes and fresh greens.\n\nAccording to the \"Swiss German Dictionary\", the name \"Landjäger\" was possibly derived from the dialect expression \"lang tige(n)\" 'smoked for a long time, air-cured for a long time'. The humorous reinterpretation in sense of 'mounted police' may be inspired by the comparison of the stiffness of sausages with that of policemen. The Alsatian and French names for smoked air-cured sausage, \"Gendarm\" and \"gendarme\", are apparently translations of the folk-etymologized German name. \"Jäger\" should be remembered as a direct, simplified, translation from the German, meaning \"hunter\". This could lead to explain the sausage's renewed popularity in the more northern, and German-settled, parts of the United States. Landjägers are considered by dedicated hunters as a food for hunters taking game to carry on the traditions associated with a lifestyle from previous generations of hunters.\n\nLandjäger sausages are made of roughly equal portions of beef and pork with lard, sugar, red wine, and spices. They are each in length, made into links of two. Prior to smoking and drying, they are pressed into a mold, which gives them their characteristic rectangular cross-section of about .

According to food scholar Neil Ravenna, the inventor was Emma Rylander Lane, of Clayton, Alabama, who won first prize with it at the county fair in Columbus, Georgia. She called it \"Prize Cake\" when she self-published a cookbook, \"A Few Good Things to Eat\" in 1898. Her published recipe included raisins, pecans, and coconut, and called for the layers to be baked in pie tins lined with ungreased brown paper rather than in cake pans.\n\nThe Lane cake is sometimes confused with the Lady Baltimore cake, which also is a liquor-laden fruit-filled cake, but of different pedigree.\n\nMany variations of the Lane cake now exist, with three or more layers of white sponge cake, separated by a filling that typically includes pecans, raisins and coconut soaked in a generous amount of bourbon, wine or brandy. It may be frosted on the top, on the sides, or both.\n\nLane cake is often found in the South at receptions, holiday dinners, or wedding showers.\n\nThe cake has a reputation as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy soft peaks. The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder. The filling ingredients can be chopped in an electric food processor today. Modern refrigeration also makes it easier to produce a stiff filling, allowing one to build an orderly multi-layer cake, rather than a sticky, lopsided dessert. Even with modern conveniences, making a traditional Lane cake is still quite a task to undertake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas. By the time the cake arrived overseas, the spirits, raisins and cake had fermented into a special delight. Many southern families have stories of \"the best cake ever tasted\".\n\nRecipes for Lane cake vary because so many Southern Cooks who made Lane cake for special occasions fiercely guarded their recipe. Some lucky cooks use a recipe passed down from generation to generation, while many others rely on vague instructions and a variety of sources in an attempt to recreate the family tradition. One such cook, Atlanta baker and Alabama native, Lise Ode, wrote about such an attempt and shares the recipe she created on her blog. Professional chef, Tori Avey, includes a recipe for Lane cake on her website complete with pictures of each step. Although it is difficult to locate a copy of Emma Rylander Lane's original cookbook or the revised edition, Some Good Things to Eat that was published in 1989, the recipe can be found in many older cookbooks. One such cookbook, The Purefoy Hotel Cook Book published in Talladega, Alabama in 1953 has been digitized and can be accessed through the Digital Public Library of America. The recipe for Lane cake appears on page 123–124.\n\nKrystina Castella and Terry Lee Stone include a recipe for Lane cake in their cookbook \"Booze Cakes: Confections Spiked With Spirits, Wine, and Beer\" which uses 2 tablespoons of bourbon in the cake, 1 cup in the filling, and a buttercream frosting made from 1 cup unsalted butter, 1/4 cup half-and-half, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, 1/4 cup bourbon, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.\n\nThe original recipe for Lane cake called for 1/4 cup Bourbon added to the filling mixture only, although the bourbon was sometimes replaced with grape juice by cooks who didn't want to use alcohol. Whisky, Wine, and Brandy are mentioned in other recipes. Still other Lane cake cooks took great pride in using a homemade liqueur, such as Scuppernong Wine, making their cake all the more special and harder to duplicate. Most cooks placed the finished Lane cake in a covered tin and allowed it to \"set\" for up to a week before serving, in order for the spongy cake to \"soak up\" the flavor. Some also wrapped the unfrosted cake in a cloth that had been soaked in the bourbon, brandy, wine or grape juice while it set in a cool place, often in a bowl set inside a dishpan and then covered. It was then frosted with 7-minute boiled icing or other whipped white frosting, usually a day or more before serving.\n\nIn Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", a Lane cake is given as a welcome gift to Aunt Alexandra by Miss Maudie Atkinson. The narrator in the story is the young daughter, Scout, of Atticus Finch. Scout reports, \"Miss Maudie baked a Lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight.\" \"Shinny\" is a slang term for liquor.\nAlso in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Miss Maudie bakes a Lane cake for Mr. Avery, who was severely injured in an attempt to put out a fire in her home. “Mr. Avery will be in bed for a week—he’s right stove up. He’s too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawford’s not looking, I’ll make him a Lane cake.

It consists of rice flour pressed into noodle form and then steamed. The food, popular in Sri Lankan cuisine and Indian cuisine, also spread to Southeast Asia, where it is called ' in Malaysian and ' in Indonesian. Sometimes, it is called string hoppers in English.\n\nAccording to food historian K. T. Achaya, Idiyappam and Appam were already known in ancient Tamil country around 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.\n\nThe origins of these dishes may stem from Sri Lanka, northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where a similar rice flour noodle is served with sugar and coconut, and sometimes banana too, and is known as idiyappam.\n\nIdiyappam is culinary specialty throughout Tamilnadu, kerala,Sri Lanka and southern areas of Karnataka. It is also a culinary staple in Sri Lanka. The name idiyappam derives from the Tamil word idi\",\" meaning 'broken down', and \"appam,\" meaning \"pancake\". Pronounced as e-di- ap-pam The dish is also, frequently, called \"noolappam\" or \"noolputtu\" from the Tamil/Malayalam word \"nool,\" meaning \"string or thread\". In coastal areas of Karnataka like Mangalore and Udupi it is also termed \"semige\" or \"semé da addae\" in Tulu, it is eaten with Tuluva chicken and fish curries called Gassi, and also a coconut milk dish called Rasayana. It is also a common breakfast item in Malaysia, where it is called \"putumayam\", typically served with brown sugar and grated coconut.\n\nPutu mayam in Malay or Idiyappam in Tamil is a dish from southern India. It is popular in southern India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.\n\nIt is made of rice flour or ragi flour (Finger millet flour), salt and water. It is generally served as the main course at breakfast or dinner together with a curry (potato, egg, fish or meat curry) and coconut chutney. It is served with coconut milk and sugar in the Malabar region of Kerala. It is not usually served at lunch. In other parts of Kerala, Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu, it is mostly eaten with spicy curries. Using wheat flour in its preparation gives it a brownish hue.\n\nMix rice flour with hot water, optionally add ghee, season with salt. Knead into a smooth dough. Fill an 'idiyappam' press or a sieve with the dough and press the noodles onto banana leaves or directly into an idli steamer. Add a little grated coconut if desired. Steam for 5–10 minutes. The idiyappam is served with coconut gratings and coconut milk.\n\nThe process for making putu mayam consists of mixing rice flour or idiyappam flour with water and/or coconut milk, and pressing the dough through a sieve to make vermicelli-like noodles. These are steamed, usually with the addition of juice from the aromatic pandan leaf (screwpine) as flavouring. The noodles are served with grated coconut and jaggery, or, preferably, gur (date palm sugar). In some areas, \"gula melaka\" (coconut palm sugar) is the favourite sweetener. \"Putu piring\" is a Malaysian version of putu mayam in which the rice flour dough is used to form a small cake around a filling of coconut and gur or jaggery.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, putu mayam and its relatives are commonly sold as street food from market stalls or carts, as well as being made at home, and are usually served cold. In Indonesia, putu mayam is called Putu mayang and is served with palm sugar mixed with coconut milk.\n\nThis dish may be eaten for breakfast with a vegetable stew or \"aviyal\", or a fish curry, etc. The same liking for serving the slightly sweet putu mayam, putu piring, or cendol with savoury dishes also occurs in Malaysia and Singapore. Idiyappam is typical of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other southern Indian states, as well as Sri Lanka. A very finely ground, commercial iddiyapam flour is sold as a sort of \"instant\" way to make all of these dishes.\n\n\n"}

They are color-triplet bosons that carry both lepton and baryon numbers. They are encountered in various extensions of the Standard Model, such as technicolor theories or GUTs based on Pati–Salam model, SU(5) or E, etc. Their quantum numbers like spin, (fractional) electric charge and weak isospin vary among theories.\n\nLeptoquarks, predicted to be nearly as heavy as an atom of lead, could only be created at high energies, and would decay rapidly. A third generation leptoquark, for example, might decay into a bottom quark and a tau lepton. Some theorists proposed that data recorded in experiments at the HERA accelerator at DESY could hint at leptoquarks, and therefore be a new force that bonds positrons and quarks. Also preons at high energies were considered. More detailed analyses could, however, not confirm these hypotheses.\n\nLeptoquarks could explain the reason for the three generations of matter. Furthermore, leptoquarks could explain why the same number of quarks and leptons exist and many other similarities between the quark and the lepton sectors. At high energies, when leptons (that do not feel the strong force) and quarks (that cannot be separately observed because of the strong force) become one, it could form a more fundamental particle and describe a higher symmetry. There would be three kinds of leptoquarks made of the leptons and quarks of each generation.\n\nThe LHeC project to add an electron ring to collide bunches with the existing LHC proton ring is proposed as a project to look for higher-generation leptoquarks.\n\nIn 1997, an excess of events at the HERA accelerator created a stir in the particle physics community, because one possible explanation of the excess was the involvement of leptoquarks. However, later studies performed both at HERA and at the Tevatron with larger samples of data ruled out this possibility for masses of the leptoquark up to around 275–325 GeV. Second generation leptoquarks were also looked for and not found. More recent studies, performed at the LHC, have raised the excluded range to about 1 TeV. For leptoquarks to be proven to exist, the missing energy in particle collisions attributed to neutrinos would have to be excessively energetic. It is likely that the creation of leptoquarks would mimic the creation of massive quarks.\n\n"}

In the Cuban city of Camagüey, the San Juan festival begins with the making and serving of ajiaco. \"La Calle\" magazine of Cuba stated that the inhabitants of the village of Santa María de Puerto del Príncipe began the tradition of making ajiaco using their own cooking ingredients, donations from passersby, surplus from farmers, and surplus slave provisions.

The first references to city chicken appeared in newspapers and cookbooks just prior to and during the Depression Era in a few cities such as Pittsburgh. City chicken typically has cooks using meat scraps to fashion a makeshift drumstick from them. It was a working-class food item. During the Depression, cooks used pork or in some cases veal because it was then cheaper than chicken in many parts of the country, especially in those markets far from rural poultry farms. Sometimes cooks would grind the meat and use a drumstick-shaped mold to form the ground meat around a skewer.\n\nThe dish is popular in cities throughout the central and eastern Great Lakes region of Ohio and Michigan as well as the northeastern Appalachian regions of Pennsylvania and Upstate New York, and at least as far south and west as Louisville, Kentucky. City chicken is commonly found in the metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Binghamton, Erie, Pittsburgh, and Scranton, hence, the dish's \"urban\" title.

Many Puerto Ricans note that arroz con pollo cannot be made without beer and annatto oil, and saffron is no substitute. Beer and annatto are rarely used in Spanish cooking and never in arroz con pollo there. Annatto is frequently used in Puerto Rican cooking especially in rice dishes like arroz con gandules (rice with pork and pigeon peas) and arroz con maiz (rice with corn and sausage). Beer is used in many Puerto Rican dishes like pollo guisado (braised stewed chicken) and asopao de pollo (chicken rice stew). Many Puerto Rican rice dishes are generously seasoned with sofrito, a spicy pepper-based sauce commonly used in arroz con pollo. \n\nFood writer Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, pointing out the international aspects of the dish, notes the origin of Arroz con Pollo in the Spanish forms of pilaf, already reflecting international influences: chicken was brought from India and rice from Asia; saffron (used for the yellow colour in Spain, instead of annatto) was introduced by Phoenician traders; tomatoes and peppers (also known as sofrito) are natives of the Americas.\n\n"}

Since its foundation in 1946, Sun-Rype has been producing juices and fruit snacks based in Kelowna, British Columbia, in the Okanagan.\n\nIncorporated on May 13, 1946, Sun-Rype was founded as BC Fruit Processing Ltd. This organization was founded by the BC Fruit Growers Association as a profitable alternative to use their process-grade apples in production rather than throwing them out. On April 2, 1959, after 13 years, BC Fruit Processing Ltd. changed its name to Sun-Rype Products Ltd.\n\nIn 1963, Sun-Rype teamed up with the Fraser Valley Milk Producers Association to distribute juice cartons on Vancouver milk routes. In 1979, it became the first juice manufacturing company in Canada to provide tetra packaging for its 250 ml and 1 L juice packs. Also, in 1992, it developed the 6 L bag in a box package. Since then, Sun-Rype has expanded manufacturing capabilities to include 1.36L PET plastic, 900ml Elopak, and a can line. The Kelowna facility also produces a range of snack products.\n\nIn 1996, Sun-Rype celebrated its 50th year in business. In recognition of this milestone, mayor Jim Stuart of the City of Kelowna honored Sun-Rype by declaring May 13, 1996 \"Sun-Rype Day\".\n\nIn November 1994, Sun-Rype announced plans to expand to China. The company signed a memorandum of understanding with Shanghai Jinqiao EPZ Scientific Development Co. Ltd. to produce and sell its juices in the Asian country. With a plant located in the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone in Pudong, Sun-Rype invested 65% of the $13 million project cost and anticipated to be selling its juices by the end of 1995.\n\nThis expansion plan almost immediately started to falter, and in 1997, Sun-Rype was forced to create a new joint venture with Lion Group, a Malaysian conglomerate. With this deal in place, Sun-Rype received land, equipment, and future working capital, while Lion Group took over ownership of the Asian subsidiary.\n\nBy 1998, after net losses of $5.8 million in 1997, the venture was not proving to be profitable, so in March of that same year, Sun-Rype decided to pull out of the Chinese market. The company absorbed $4.4 million in losses.\n\nIn July 1996, Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation initiated a $40 million hostile takeover bid of Sun-Rype. The reasons behind this attempt were to immediately double Clearly Canadian's revenues and give it use of Sun-Rype's bottling plant, thus centralizing its production facilities. In order to initiate the takeover, Clearly Canadian began buying as many shares as possible from local apple growers who had been issued the shares over the last five decades in return for the process-grade apples used in production by Sun-Rype. At the time of the takeover attempt, Sun-Rype was still a co-operative organization, not a public company, so there were few ways for shareholders to sell their shares.\n\nShareholders were given the option of either one Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share, or $1.61 and a half of a Clearly Canadian share per Sun-Rype share. This offer finally gave true financial value to the shares, inclining many shareholders to sell them. Both Sun-Rype's board of directors and the BC Fruit Growers Association argued against the takeover attempt to shareholders, and on July 18, the board of directors offered an 18–page document detailing why shareholders should refrain from selling. On July 24, just days later, Clearly Canadian also sent out a document describing to shareholders why they should sell their shares. Both of these documents contained invalid and misleading information about each company, such as share values and purchase options to shareholders, so on July 31, the British Columbia Securities Commission issued an order for both companies to correct the statements.\n\nWith the bid offer expiry date of August 7 approaching, Clearly Canadian decided to extend its offer expiration date to August 19. It claimed it was doing this to give shareholders more time to decide whether or not to sell their shares. This extension caused further rifts between the two companies, with Sun-Rype claiming reason for the extension, while Clearly Canadian stayed focused on acquiring as many shares as possible. With the final bid deadline fast approaching, Clearly Canadian used many tactics in an attempt to gain more shares, including sending out circulars, hosting public receptions, and talking to community press. In the end however, Sun-Rype, which spent $741,000 fighting the takeover, was able to prevail over Clearly Canadian, losing only 15.8% of its shares to the beverage corporation.\n\nThe hostile takeover attempt by Clearly Canadian proved how unsatisfied shareholders were with Sun-Rype management styles and caused differences within the company, apple growing community, and investors. As a result, Sun-Rype finally went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange on November 12, 1996, with 2.35 million shares opening at $2.75 a share. It used the profits from the offering to pay off a $6.3 million bank debt and help fund its new Chinese operation.\n\nIn September 2013, Sun-Rype Products Ltd. became privately owned by the Jim Pattison Group.\n\nSunRype’s flagship product is not from concentrate apple juice which is also known as “Blue Label” apple juice. SunRype was the first to combine fruit and vegetable together in a juice.\n\nIn the early 1990s the company expanded into snack foods with the launch of Fruit to Go, a 100% fruit snack made with fruit juices and purees, followed by Energy to Go in 1999, which was replaced by FruitSource in 2005. SunRype Energy and Fruit & Chia bars moved the brand beyond 100% fruit to incorporate new ingredients such as oats, seeds, protein and chocolate. In 2016, SunRype re-positioned its snack lineup as gluten free, nut free, vegan and kosher. Further to this strategy, SunRype released Good Bites, a date-based snack.\n\nIn 2017, expanded its beverage portfolio and began selling cider in private liquor stores in BC and Alberta under the SunRype brand name. The company also introduced a line of iced teas in 355ml tall cans, called SunRype Sparkling Tea.\n\n"}

The Tamil word \"kaalam\" refers to duration (an interval) in time. It is also the name of a deity, in which sense it is not always distinguishable from \", meaning \"black\". It is often used as one of the various names or forms of Yama. Kaal/Kaala is also referred to the concept of Spacetime. In the Yogic System the concept of SpaceTime was referred to as one word rather than two separate concepts of Space (darkness) and Time.\n\nMonier-Williams's widely used Sanskrit-English dictionary lists two distinct words with the form \".\n\n\nAccording to Monier-Williams, ' 2 is from the verbal root ' \"to calculate\", while the root of \"\" 1 is uncertain, though possibly the same.\n\nAs applied to gods and goddesses in works such as the ' ' and the \"Skanda\" ', ' 1 and ' 2 are not readily distinguishable. Thus Wendy Doniger, translating a conversation between and from the \"Skanda\" ', says ' may mean \" 'the Great Death' ... or 'the Great Black One' \". And , a Hindu translator of the ' ', renders the feminine compound ' (where \"\" means \"night\") as \"dark night of periodic dissolution\".\n\nAs Time personified, destroying all things, Kala is a god of death sometimes identified with Yama.\n\nKala appears as an impersonal deity within the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Bhagavata Purana. In the Mahabharata, Krishna, one of the main characters, reveals his identity as Time personified. He states to Arjuna that both sides on the battlefield of the Kurukshetra War have already been annihilated. At the end of the epic, the entire Yadu dynasty (Krishna's family) is similarly annihilated. The story ends with Yudhishthira, the last of the Pandava brothers, entering Heaven in his human form, thereby closing the link. In Heaven, Yudi sees everyone within the story, both people whom he hated, and people whom he loved, and is happy to see them all. He then sees their transcendent cosmic forms, Krishna as Vishnu, Draupadi as uma, and realizes that the participants in the play were merely gods in human form, engaging in pastimes and working out their karma. Yudi then abandons his bitterness and spends the rest of eternity in Heaven, it is a happy ending.\n\nKala appears in the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana, as the messenger of Death (Yama). At the end of the story, Time, in the form of inevitability or necessity, informs Rama that his reign on Earth is now over. By a trick or dilemma, he forces the death of Lakshmana, and informs Rama that he must return to the realm of the gods. Lakshmana willingly passes away with Rama's blessing and Rama returns to Heaven.\n\nTime appears in the Bhagavata Purana as the force that is responsible for the imperceptible and inevitable change in the entire creation. According to the Purana, all created things are illusory, and thereby subject to creation and annihilation, this imperceptible and inconceivable impermanence is said to be due to the march of Time. Similarly, Time is considered to be the unmanifest aspect of God that remains after the destruction of the entire world at the end of a lifespan of Brahma.\n\nIn the Chaitanya Bhagavata, a Gaudiya Vaishnavist text and biography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, it is said that the fire that emerges from the mouth of Sankarshana at the End of Time is the \"Kālānala\", or \"fire of Time\". One of the names of Sankarshana is \"k\"ā\"l\"ā\"gni\", also \"fire of Time\".\n\nThe Vishnu Purana also states that Time (kala) is one of the four primary forms of Vishnu, the others being matter (Pradhana), visible substance (vyakta), and Spirit (Purusha).\n\nAt Bhagavad Gita 11.32, Krishna takes on the form of \"kāla\", the destroyer, announcing to Arjuna that all the warriors on both sides will be killed, apart from the Pandavas:\nकालो ऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत् प्रवृद्धो लोकान् समाहर्तुम् इह प्रवृत्तः ।\n\nThis verse means: \"Time (kāla) I am, the great destroyer of the worlds, and I have come here to destroy all people.\" This phrase is famous for being quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer as he reflected on the Manhattan Project's explosion of the first nuclear bomb in 1945.\n\nIn Javanese mythology, Batara Kala is the god of destruction. It is a very huge mighty and powerful god depicted as giant, born of the sperm of Shiva, the kings of gods.\n\nIn Borobudur, the gate to the stairs is adorned with a giant head, making the gate look like the open mouth of the giant. Many other gates in Javanese traditional buildings have this kind of ornament. Perhaps the most detailed Kala Face in Java is on the south side of Candi Kalasan.\n\n"}
{"id": "3166059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3166059", "title": "Heimat", "text": "Heimat\n\nHeimat () is a German word \ntranslating to \"home\" or \"homeland\". \nThe word has connotations specific to German culture, German society and specifically German Romanticism, German nationalism, German statehood and regionalism so that it has no exact English equivalent. \n\nThere is no single definition for the term “Heimat”. Bausinger describes it as a spatial and social unit of medium range, wherein the individual is able to experience safety and the reliability of its existence, as well as a place of a deeper trust:\nGreverus (1979) focuses especially on the concept of identity. To him, \"Heimat\" is an “idyllic world” and can only be found within the trinity of community, space and tradition; because only there human desires for identity, safety and an active designing of life can be pleased. In any case \"Heimat\", or even better: the examination thereof, is one of several identification sectors creating self-awareness.\n\nIn terms of ethnology and anthropology, \"Heimat\" reflects the need for spatial orientation and the first “territory” that can offer identity, stimulation and safety for one’s own existence (Paul Leyhausen). From an existentially philosophical perspective, home provides the individual with a spatiotemporal orientation for self-preparation, in opposition to the term of strangeness (Otto Friedrich Bollnow). In terms of sociology, home belongs to the constitutional conditions for group identity in complementarity to strangeness (Georg Simmel).\n\nThe German equivalent of \"home\" is \"Heim\" (Germanic \"*haimaz\"). The feminine noun \"Heimat\" is attested around the 11th century (late OHG \"heimōti\" n., MGH \"heimōt(e)\" f., n.) by way of the suffix \"*-ōt(i)-\" expressing a state or condition also found in \"Monat\" = \"month\", which became somewhat productive in medieval German (c.f \"Heirat\", \"Zierat\", \"Kleinod\", \"Einöde\"). There is a close Gothic cognate \"haimōþli\" (for ἀγρός \"lands, homestead\" in Mark 10, reflected in OHG \"heimōdili\").\n\nThe semantic distinction from simple \"home\" (\"Heim\") at least by the 16th century is that \"Heim\" denotes an individual house (or homestead, farmstead inhabited by an extended family) while \"Heimat\"\ndenotes the wider homeland (\"patria\") of a people or tribe. It is glossed with \"patria\" throughout, and as such is synonymous with \"Vaterland\"\nLuther translates the phrase \"the land of my kindred\" (\"terra nativitatis mea\" ) in Genesis 24:7 as \"meine Heimat\".\nUse of \"Heimat\" in the larger sense of Germany as the homeland of a German nation is first recorded in the 17th century (Zincgref, \" Apophthegmata\" 1626–1631).\nThe word nevertheless retains the pragmatic sense of habitat (of plants and animals, Philipp Andreas Nemnich), a person's place of birth or permanent residence, and in Upper German (Bavarian and Swiss) also of the house inherited from one's father.\n\nAuthors, who had to leave their homeland due to their prosecution in the Third Reich described this notion from their memories as realistic as possible. Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Alfred Döblin, Lion Feuchtwanger, Leonhard Frank, Ludwig Marcuse, Franw Werfel and Stefan Zweig are some well-known examples of such authors.\n\nThe term Utopia is also a spatial category as “utopos” literally means “no place”. To tie in with the exile literature, homeland can also be described as a notion which isn’t reached yet. The concrete utopia is Ernst Bloch’s notion of homeland which he created in his main work \"The Principle of Hope\" (Das Prinzip Hoffnung) during his exile in the United States. Bloch, who opposed war in Wilhelmian Germany in 1914, who had to leave Nazi-Germany in the 1930s as he was a Marxian Jew and who was forced to emigrate from the German Democratic Republic in the 1950s, defines homeland as something beyond class society. That way he summarized \"Thesen über Feuerbach\" (theses about Feuerbach) by Karl Marx as follows:\nBased on this, Bernhard Schlink evoked once again reconstructive homeland as a utopia. This representation explicitly pushed the notion’s part linked to the location away and considers homeland as “non-location”: a feeling, a hope, a desire to experienct especially in exile. This idea would be already preformed a long time ago in the Christian representation of the world, in which humanity was in exile on the earth since the fall of mankind.\n\nIn 2014 the slogan of the series of events in the occasion of the celebration of peace in Augsburg was: “Homeland? Never been there!” („Heimat? Da war ich noch nie!“)\n\nThe concept of “Heimat” first emerged in a literary context that was neither religious nor poetic during the period of Industrialization and Romanticism. People moved from the country to the cities to an increasing degree in order to find employment in a factory, which eventually led to urban expansion and the impoverishment of many. The rise of capitalism caused social hierarchies to shift. Prior distinctions of social classes such as aristocracy and peasantry gradually dissolved (due to urban expansion and the rise of capitalism) and were replaced by the conceptions of proletariat and bourgeoisie instead. Those who were at risk of social deprivation perceived the new world order, in which the upper-class was shrinking and there were more industry workers, as something “unheim(at)lich” (literal German translation in the sense of something “unfamiliar” and disconcerting.). The so-called \"Heimat-movement\" was primarily concerned with a fear of loss of “the good old days” as well as the opposed glorification and idealization of rural life. The \"Heimat-movement\" thereby sharply opposed the ideas of progress and Enlightenment. In the 19th century, the concept of “Heimat” was thus closely associated with the preindustrial way of life and its tragic downfall. Farmers were regarded as the most pristine and wholesome members of society and fascinated many around 1900, which gave a rise to literary regionalism, a type of formula fiction.\n\nThe term “Heimat” also applies to affiliations with other individuals but also to oneself. The concept of “Heimat” is closely associated with the present – as its meaning is established in a particular moment – and aims to provide an answer to a central question: Am I in the right place? Which place in the world do I want to make my home?”\n\nOrtwin Renn disagrees with the idea that metropolises nowadays cannot be perceived as “Heimat”. According to him, we live in an era of industrial mass societies as well as increasing international interdependence. Therefore, he argues that the concept of “Heimat” could not simply be considered a part of pre-modern agricultural societies and idyllic sceneries on the country side. Renn believes that these conceptions were in fact fictional, just as much as mental images of industrialized cities and areas with high population density.\n\nFrom a sociological point of view, anyone without social roots can be considered “heimatlos” in some way. A geographical distance from the place of birth or the current residence is not required for this form of \"Heimatlosigkeit\". The feeling of being uprooted can arise due to a changing landscape in a once familiar environment, through new- or reconstruction of buildings and streets, through societal changes and by devaluation of one's acquired competences throughout life.\n\nIn the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s, many so-called movies about the concept of “Heimat” (\"Heimatfilm\") were made, which are attributed to trivial entertainment. This aspect can not be assigned to all \"Heimatfilme\" (a movie genre about the concept of Heimat) nevertheless, especially to the \"Heimatfilme\" in the 1970s up until now. The movie trilogy “Heimatbild” by Edgar Reitz in particular, made in 1984 to 2004, conveyed a new, differentiated concept of “Heimat” by incorporating as few clichés of the ideal world as possible.\n\nStaying in touch with one's \"Heimat\" (\"Heimatpflege\") is primarily done in associations; in very few states it is organized by the government. The respective associations try to maintain the \"Heimatpflege\" tradition, a cultural asset that needs to be held up. However, museums dealing with the issue of \"Heimat\" promote local tourism by presenting folklore, no matter how accurate their display of the region is. Cultural possessions, traditional clothing for instance, are oftentimes worn in front of a paying audience, but not in a private environment. \n\nIn Germany, most of the \"Heimat\" associations dealing with the authentic display of specific regional clothing are connected to the German society for traditional costumes based in Munich. More than 2 Million members belong to this association, among them also 200.000 young adults and children. Their (financial) supporters often play an active part within the local community, especially in rural communities. Regional traditional costumes are worn in respect to contemporary demands and needs for clothing.\nThe background history of a certain region or location in the sense of \"Heimat\" as a cultural identity considers the history of \"Heimat\" or the ethnology (\"Volkskunde\"). This is documented in \"Heimat\" museums.\n\nToday, „Heimat“ is considered a subjective emotion, not necessarily related to political or legal definitions. It is made up of the individual mindset one has about a certain place, society or just the individual's development. Losing one's „Heimat“ or even even just the fear of that occurring, presents as „Heimweh“. To those who lost or left their „Heimat“, the term can become synonymous with „home country“. It is possible to choose one's own „Heimat“ from a selection of places. However, „Heimat“ can also be lost through a natural disaster or a radical change by human intervention.\n\nA guest contribution by Oliver Kontny in the programme to the „Augsburger Hohes Friedensfest“ 2014 that had „Heimat? Never been there before“ as its motto also treats this subject. Kontny indicates, that only very few cities have the same significance to those that were raised there and later returned as adults. This is due to the cities' structural alteration into spaces, in which excess capital can produce even more income return, he says (orig. German: „Städte umgebaut [werden] zu Räumen, in denen überschüssiges Kapital noch mehr Rendite abwerfen kann“), which makes it hard for many of them to have feelings of „Heimat“. It is quite frankly impossible to live in the same city twice, even if it's all one has ever done, adds Kontny (orig. German: „nicht zweimal in derselben Stadt leben, und wenn man sein Leben lang nichts anderes täte“). „People come for personal reasons or to find work, but then they stay because they can't get away from all the parties and alcohol.“ Without diversity management it is difficult to convey a sense of „Heimat“ to immigrants according to their new place of residence.\n\nWhen we speak of language as a cultural „Heimat“, talk is of an exiled German author, who names the German language or German literature his home. „Heimat“ as a way of life describes the creed of a seaman : „My home is the ocean“.\n\nIn the 19th century, \"Heimat\" acquired strong emotional connotations in the context of both German Romanticism and German nationalism (but also patriotism based on regional identity).\n\nThe concept of a (typically rural, idyllic) native homeland as an expression of identity \nin the context of the exodus from rural areas into more urbanised communities (\"Landflucht\") during the Industrial Revolution can be seen as a reaction to the onset of modernity, loss of individuality and intimate community. \n\nThe specific aspects of \"Heimat\"—love and attachment to homeland—left the idea vulnerable to easy assimilation into the fascist \"blood and soil\" literature of the National Socialists since it is relatively easy to add to the positive feelings for the \"Heimat\" a rejection of anything foreign, that is not necessarily there in the first place. \nIt was conceived by the National Socialists (Nazis) that the \"Volk\" community is deeply rooted in the land of their \"Heimat\" through their practice of agriculture and their ancestral lineage going back hundreds and thousands of years. The Third Reich was regarded at the deepest level as the sacred \"Heimat\" of the unified \"Volk\" community—the national slogan was \"One Reich, One Volk, One Führer\". Those who were taken to Nazi concentration camps were those who were officially declared by the SS to be \"enemies of the volk community\" and thus a threat to the integrity and security of the heimat.\n\nThe contemporary conception of \"Heimat\" is most readily seen in the \"Heimatfilm\" from the \"Heimat\" period c. 1946–1965, in which filmmakers placed a profound emphasis on nature and the provincial homeliness of Germany. Forests, mountains, landscapes, and rural areas portrayed Germany in a homely light with which the German people readily identified.\n\nIn 1984, Edgar Reitz released his film \"Heimat\", highlighting the provincial sense of belonging and the conflict that exists between urban and rural life.\n\nAlon Confino, in his book \"Germany as a Culture of Remembrance: Promises and Limits of Writing History\" (2006) sees the post-war concept of \"Heimat\" as having emerged as a reaction to Germany's self-imposed position on the world stage, a symptom of the forced introversion following the world wars, and an attempt at individual distancing from responsibility for Nazi Germany's actions.\n\n\"Heimatschutz\" is the German term for \"protection of national heritage\".\nThe so-called \"\" or \"Heimatschutzstil\" is an architectural style that was first described in 1904 and was practised until the late 1960s. Its goal was to embed buildings into their regional cultural environment by referencing local design features, such as materials, proportions and shapes. Unlike the historism found in the 19th century, \"Heimatschutz\" did not embrace ornate and decorative elements and tried to reinterpret traditional techniques and regional design languages in a clean and modern way. The German association for \"Heimatschutz\", the \"Deutsche Bund für Heimatschutz\", was founded in Dresden in 1904 with a focus on built heritage conservation and the furtherance of traditional crafts and techniques.\n\nIn international law the \"right to one's homeland\" (German: \"Recht auf die Heimat\"; French: \"droit au foyer\"; Italian: \"diritto alla Patria\"; Spanish: \"derecho a la patria\") is a concept that has been gaining acceptance as a fundamental human right and a precondition to the exercise of the right to self-determination. In 1931 at the Académie de Droit International in The Hague (Hague Academy of International Law), Robert Redslob spoke of the right to the homeland in connection with the right to self-determination in \"Le principe des nationalités\".\n\nGeorges Scelle in Belgium, Felix Ermacora in Austria, Alfred de Zayas in the United States, and Christian Thomuschat and Dieter Blumenwitz in Germany are amongst those who have written extensively on the subject.\n\nThe first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso of Ecuador affirmed this right, which is reflected in the 13-point Declaration appended to the Final Report on \"Human Rights and Population Transfers\".\n\n"}

A variant of the dish uses seafood.\n\n\"Jajangmyeon\" dates back to 1905, when it was introduced in \"Gonghwachun\" (), a Chinese restaurant in Incheon Chinatown run by an immigrant from the Shandong Province of China. The restaurant is now the Jjajangmyeon Museum.\n\nAlthough the name \"jajangmyeon\" is cognate with the Chinese dish \"zhájiàngmiàn\" (), Korean \"jajangmyeon\" differs in many ways. Yong Chen, an associate history professor at the University of California, Irvine, argued that although the dish \"began as the Northern Chinese noodle-and-ground pork dish \"zhájiàngmiàn\", it is thoroughly Korean.\"\n\nIn the mid-50s in South Korea, soon after the Korean War, \"jajangmyeon\" was sold at low prices so that anyone could eat it without burden. The new Korean-style Jajangmyeon began to gain explosive popularity among the many merchants visiting the port of Incheon, which was the center of trade, and the many dock workers working in the fish market, and quickly spread throughout the country.\n\n\"Jajang\" (; alternately spelled \"jjajang\" ) is derived from the Chinese word \"zhájiàng\" (), which means \"fried sauce\". \"Myeon\" () means \"noodles\". The Chinese characters are pronounced \"jak\" () and \"jang\" () in Korean, but the noodle dish is called \"jajangmyeon\", not \"jakjangmyeon\", because its origin is not the Sino-Korean word, but a transliteration of the Chinese pronunciation. As the Chinese pronunciation of \"zhá\" sounded like \"jja\" (rather than \"ja\") to Korean ears, the dish is known in South Korea as \"jjajangmyeon\", and the vast majority of Korean Chinese restaurants use this spelling.\n\nFor many years, until 22 August 2011, the National Institute of Korean Language did not recognize the word \"jjajangmyeon\" as an accepted idiomatic transliteration. The reason \"jjajangmyeon\" did not become the standard spelling was due to the transliteration rules for foreign words announced in 1986 by the Ministry of Education, which stated that the foreign obstruents should not be transliterated using doubled consonants except for some established usages. The inacknowledgment faced tough criticism from the supporters of the spelling \"jjajangmyeon\", such as Ahn Do-hyeon, a Sowol Poetry Prize winning poet. Later, \"jjajangmyeon\" was accepted as an alternate standard spelling alongside \"jajangmyeon\" in the National Language Deliberation Council and, on 31 August, included as a standard spelling in the Standard Korean Language Dictionary.\n\n\"Jajangmyeon\" uses thick, hand-made or machine-pulled noodles made from wheat flour, salt, baking soda, and water. The sauce, \"jajang\", is made with fried \"chunjang\" with other ingredients, such as soy sauce (and/or oyster sauce), meat (usually pork, but sometimes beef), seafood (usually squid and/or shrimp), fragrants (scallions, ginger, and garlic), vegetables (usually onions, zucchini or Korean zucchini, or cabbage), stock, and starch slurry.\n\nWhen served, \"jajangmyeon\" may be topped with julienned cucumber, scallions, egg garnish, boiled or fried egg, blanched shrimp, and/or stir-fried bamboo shoot slices. The dish is usually served with \"danmuji\" (yellow pickled radish), sliced raw onions, and \"chunjang\" sauce for dipping the onions.\n\nVariations of the jajangmyeon dish include \"gan-jjajang\", \"jaengban-jjajang\", \"yuni-jjajang\", and \"samseon-jjajang\".\nThere can be combinations. For example. \"samseon-gan-jjajang\" may refer to seafood jajangmyeon made without adding water.\n\nDishes such as \"jajang-bap\" and \"jajang-tteok-bokki\" also exist. \"Jajang-bap\" is essentially the same dish as \"jajangmyeon\", but served with rice instead of noodles. \"Jajang-tteok-bokki\" is \"tteok-bokki\" served with \"jajang\" sauce instead of the usual spicy sauce.\n\nInstant \"jajangmyeon\" products, such as Chapagetti, Chacharoni, and Zha Wang, are instant noodle versions of \"jajangmyeon\" consisting of dried noodles that are boiled in the same manner as \"ramyeon\", using dried vegetable pieces that are drained and mixed with \"jajang\" powder or liquid \"jajang\" sauce, as well as a small amount of water and oil.\n\n"}

The circuit under test is completely de-energized prior to connecting the apparatus.\n\nThe tester consists of an indicator in series with a source of electrical power - normally a battery, terminating in two test leads. If a complete circuit is established between the test-leads, the indicator is activated.\n\nThe indicator may be an electric light or a buzzer. This led to the term \"buzzing out a circuit\" (which means to test for continuity) Audible continuity buzzers or beepers are built into some models of multimeter, and the continuity setting is normally shared with the ohmmeter setting. \n\nA popular design has the tester combined with a standard flashlight. A phone connector or jack plug in the rear of the unit permits a set of test leads to be plugged in effecting a quick conversion between the two applications.\n\nFor situations where continuity testing must be done on high resistance circuits, or where delicate conductors and sensitive components that might be damaged by excessive current are present, a low voltage, low current device must be used. These typically use an op-amp and watch batteries to drive an LED as an indicator. These testers can be exquisitely sensitive; for example they will indicate if the test points are taken by both hands.\n\nThere are times when a simple continuity test fails to reveal the problem. For example, vibration-induced problems in automobile wiring can be extremely difficult to detect because a short or open is not maintained long enough for a standard tester to respond.\n\nIn these applications a latching continuity tester is used. A more complex device, it detects intermittent opens and shorts as well as steady-state conditions. These devices contain a fast acting electronic switch (generally a Schmitt trigger) forming a gated astable oscillator which detects and locks (latches) the indicator on an intermittent condition with a duration of less than a millisecond.\n\n\n"}

Its name derives from the dessert's liquid chocolate center, and it is also known as chocolate \"moelleux\" (from French for \"soft\"), chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but instead a lot of chocolate and butter, hence melting on the palate (but not on the plate).\n\nThe United States-based chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten claims to have invented molten chocolate cake in New York City in 1987, but the French chef and chocolatier Jacques Torres disputes this, arguing that such a dish already existed in France. According to Vongerichten, he pulled a chocolate sponge cake from the oven before it was done and found that the center was still runny, but was warm and had both a good taste and texture. Regardless of who invented the dish, Vongerichten has been credited with popularizing it in the United States, and it became almost a \"de rigueur\" inclusion on high-end restaurant dessert menus.\n\nMolten chocolate cakes characteristically contain five ingredients: butter, eggs, sugar, chocolate, and flour. The butter and chocolate are melted together, while the eggs are either whisked with the sugar to form a thick paste, producing a denser pastry, or separated, with the white whipped into a meringue to provide more lift and a lighter result. A tablespoon of strong coffee is sometimes added to enhance the chocolate flavor. Vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon are additionally recommended in some cases to add extra flavor.\n\nThe cakes are typically baked in individual portions in ramekins, however, there are a number of creative variations in chocolate lava cakes or molten chocolate cakes such as preparing the cakes in a coffee or tea mug. The cake can also be prepared in a microwave oven instead of an oven in certain cases.\n\nFresh raspberries, a drizzling of raspberry and/or chocolate sauce, and dustings of powdered sugar are typical enhancements.

The word is mainly used in Berlin and northern Germany. Similar quarters are called \"Veedel\" in Cologne and \"Grätzl\" in Vienna.\n\nThe word \"Kietz\" originated in the time of the eastward expansion of German settlers in the Middle Ages into West Slavic territories (\"Germania Slavica\"), when in many places both communities existed side by side. The word possibly is of Slavonic origin (\"chyza\" meaning hut or cottage, cf. Kessinians) and referred to a Slavic settlement (typically of fishermen) near a German town. Some placenames are reminiscent of this meaning, for example Küstrin-Kietz or the Kietz quarter of Berlin-Köpenick.\n\nMedieval \"Kietz\" settlements were first documented in the 14th century. They were often located near a castle or a river crossing and initially inhabited by Slavic vassals (\"Wends\"). They were prevalent in the Margraviate of Brandenburg as well as in Mecklenburg and in the Duchy of Pomerania. For a long time \"Kietze\" formed a distinct community beside the neighbouring peasant villages, though evidences of a specific Slavic population become rare in the course of an increasing Germanisation. From the late 18th century onwards, the denotation \"Kietz\" was generally applied to fishermen's villages and remote settlements. In its transferred sense, the word became a (sometimes mocking) denotation for Berlin neighbourhoods. \n\nA \"Kiez\" is never originally defined by the municipality or government, but rather by the inhabitants, and therefore doesn't necessarily coincide with administrative divisions. In some cases, however, such definitions have been picked up in official documents, this including State legislation.\n\nIn Berlin the term usually has a positive connotation, as inhabitants often identify with the \"Kiez\" they live in. There is a rising number of approximately 20 unofficial \"Kiez\"-areas in Berlin, most often in and around the city centre. A Berliner \"Kiez\" usually consists mainly of pre-war buildings and upholds its own commercial and cultural infrastructure. Outside Berlin, \"Kiez\" may be considered by some as somewhat slangy. \nIn Hamburg, \"der Kiez\" refers to the area around the Reeperbahn in the St. Pauli quarter, which is the city's nightlife and red-light district. It is the most well known \"Kiez\" in Germany and is sometimes mistakenly considered to be the first or original \"Kiez\". In other towns, such as Hanover, red-light districts are sometimes referred to as the \"Kiez\" following Hamburg's example. Also in smaller cities, some districts may be referred to as a \"Kiez\", especially when there are vital scenes of culture, pubs and clubs - an example being the \"KTV\", a district of Rostock. \n\nThe more standard German term for a neighborhood in the sense of \"where one lives\" is \"Viertel\" (quarter).\n"}
{"id": "3191280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3191280", "title": "Tea egg", "text": "Tea egg\n\nTea egg is a typical Chinese savory food commonly sold as a snack, in which a boiled egg is cracked slightly and then boiled again in tea, and sauce or spices. It is also known as marble egg because cracks in the egg shell create darkened lines with marble-like patterns. Commonly sold by street vendors or in night markets in most Chinese communities throughout the world, it is also commonly served in Asian restaurants. Although it originated from China and is traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine, other similar recipes and variations have been developed throughout Asia.\n\nFragrant and flavorful tea eggs are a traditional Chinese food. The original recipe uses various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves. A commonly used spice for flavoring tea eggs is Chinese five-spice powder, which contains ground cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds, cloves and Szechuan peppercorns. Some recipes do not use tea leaves, but they are still called \"tea eggs\". In the traditional method of preparation, eggs are boiled until they reach a hardened, cooked state. The boiled eggs are removed from the water, and the entire shell of each egg is gently cracked all around. The cracking method is the formal feature in this traditional egg recipe. Smaller cracks produce more marbling, visible when the egg is peeled for eating. The extra water from the boiling should be allowed to seep out of the eggs on its own. After about ten minutes, the cracked eggs are ready to be put into the prepared spiced-tea liquid and simmered over medium heat. This simmering allows the spiced fluid to seep into the cracks and marinate the eggs inside their shells. After about twenty minutes, the eggs and liquid are transferred to a glass or ceramic container for further steeping in a refrigerator. For best results, the eggs should be allowed to steep for at least several hours. The dark color of the spiced tea gives the egg a marbled effect when it is peeled to be eaten.\n\nAnother method of making tea eggs is to boil the eggs until fully cooked inside, then removing the hard-boiled eggs from their shells and letting them steep in the spiced tea mixture at low heat for a little longer. The eggs and liquid are removed from the heat and transferred to a glass or ceramic container for further steeping. This method requires a shorter steeping time than the traditional method; however, the egg is less visually appealing without the marbled effect from the traditional cracked-shell method of preparation. The eggs can be eaten at any time. The longer they are allowed to steep, the richer the flavor will be. The perfect spiced tea egg should have a balance between the egg's natural flavor and that of the spices. \n\nThis form of tea egg is very similar to the soy egg.\n\nWhen the shell is peeled off, the egg should have regions of light and dark brown, with a mid-brownish tone along the cracks of the shell. The yolk should be yellow all the way through, though overcooked eggs will have a thin, harmless greyish layer while the core is the usual yellow. The flavor depends on the tea (type and strength) and variety of spices used. Five-spice powder adds a savory, slightly salty tone to the egg white, and the tea should bring out the yolk's flavor.\n\nIn mainland China, tea eggs are a household treat. They are also sold in stores, restaurants, and from street vendors.\n\nIn Taiwan, Chinese tea eggs are a fixture of convenience stores. Through 7-Eleven chains alone, an average of 40 million tea eggs are sold per year. In recent years, major producers of tea eggs have branched out into fruit and other flavored eggs, such as raspberry, blueberry and salted duck egg.\n\nIn Indonesia, Chinese tea eggs have been adopted into native Indonesian cuisine as \"telur pindang\" and the ingredients have also been slightly changed. The \"telur pindang\" is hard-boiled eggs boiled with spices, salt and soy sauce. However, instead of black tea, the Indonesian version uses leftover shallot skins, teak leaves, or guava leaves as dark brownish coloring agents. \"Telur pindang\" is commonly found in Indonesia, but it is more prevalent in Java and South Sumatra. The \"telur pindang\" is often served as part of tumpeng, nasi kuning, or nasi campur. In Yogyakarta, telur pindang is often served with nasi gudeg or just hot steamed rice.\n\nTelur pindang (the Malaysian variation of the tea egg recipe) is said to have its roots in the state of Johor, where the cuisine is most popular, but can also can be found in other parts of the Malay Peninsula. The dish even has sub-variations of the traditional Johorean recipe in many other southern regions. Telur pindang is an occasional cuisine, requiring time and resource-consuming work, and would only be served on special occasions such as weddings. Today, however, there are many commercial telur pindang suppliers nationwide.\n"}

It is also used as filling for various buns and pastries, and as a snack food on its own. \"Rousong\" is a very popular food item in Chinese cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nRousong is made by stewing cuts of pork or beef in a sweetened soy sauce mixture until individual muscle fibres can be easily torn apart with a fork. This happens when the water-insoluble collagen that holds the muscle fibres of the meat together has been converted into water-soluble gelatine. The meat is teased apart, strained, and partially dried in the oven. It is then mashed and beaten while being dry-cooked in a large wok until it is nearly completely dry. Additional flavourings are usually added while the mixture is being dry-fried. Five kilograms of meat will usually yield about 1 kg of floss.\n\nFish can also be made into floss (魚鬆; \"yú sōng\"), though initial stewing is not required due to the low collagen and elastin content of fish meat. Rabbit and duck floss can also be found in China.\n\nIn Muslim-majority Indonesia and Malaysia, beef or chicken floss is the most popular variant and is commonly called \"abon\" (Indonesian) or \"serunding\" (Malay). In Malaysia, \"serunding\" is a popular delicacy during Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. \n\nIn Muslim-majority Hausa cuisine, \"dambu nama\" is a dry, shredded beef snack, similar to Rousong. It is fried and heavily spiced in its preparation.\n\nA very similar product is pork \"fu\" (; pinyin: \"ròufǔ\"; ), which is less fried and less shredded than \"rousong\", and has a more fibrous texture.\n\nIn Northern Nigeria, beef is used to make a similar dish, called \"dambun nama\"\n\nA study has demonstrated a positive correlation between increased processing temperatures of rousong and increased formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) within the meat. Up to seven different HAAs were found when rousong was processed at 150°C.\n\n"}

Poitín was traditionally distilled in a small pot still and the term is a diminutive of the Irish word \"pota\", meaning \"pot\". The Irish word for a hangover is \"póit\".\nIn accordance with the Irish Poteen/Irish Poitin technical file, it can only be made from cereals, grain, whey, sugar beet, molasses and potatoes.\n\nTo authorise the distillation of spirits a requirement was introduced at the parliament at Drogheda in 1556 which necessitated a licence under the great seal.\n\nToday in Ireland there are a number of commercially produced spirits labelled as poitín, poteen or potcheen. In 2008, Irish poitín was accorded (GI) Geographical Indicative Status by the EU Council and Parliament\n\nIn 2015, in consultation with producers and stakeholders, the Irish Government adopted the Geographical Indication technical file for poitín, outlining the production methods that must be used in order for a spirit to be called Irish Poitín. Topics covered included allowable base materials, distillation method, use of flavourings/infusions and limited storage in casks.\n\nPotheen or poteen was also produced in the growing Irish diaspora in the 19th century, particularly in any of the New York City neighborhoods dubbed \"Irishtown.\"\n\nPoitín was generally produced in remote rural areas, away from the interference of the law. A wash was created and fermented before the distillation began. Stills were often set up on land boundaries so the issue of ownership could be disputed. Prior to the introduction of bottled gas, the fire to heat the wash was provided by turf. Smoke was a giveaway for the Gardaí, so windy, broken weather was chosen to disperse the smoke. The still was heated and attended to for several days to allow the runs to go through.\n\nThe old style of poitín distilling was from a malted barley base for the mash, the same as single malt whiskey or pure pot still whiskey distilled in Ireland. The word \"poitín\" stems from the Irish Gaelic word \"pota\" for pot; this refers to the small copper pot still used by poitín distillers.\n\nIn more recent times, some distillers deviated from using malted barley as a base of the mash bill due to the cost and availability instead switching to using treacle, corn and potatoes. It is believed this switch led to the deteriorating quality and character of poitín in the late 20th century.\n\nThe quality of poitín was highly variable, depending on the skill of the distiller and the quality of their equipment. Reputations were built on the quality of the distiller's poitín, and many families became known for their distilling expertise, where a bad batch could put a distiller out of business overnight. It has been claimed that the drink can cause blindness but this is possibly due to adulteration rather than lack of quality.\n\nPoitín is a trope in Irish poetry and prose of the nineteenth century. The Irish critic Sinéad Sturgeon has demonstrated how the illegality of the substance became a crucial theme running through the works of Maria Edgeworth and William Carlton. Many characters in the work of contemporary Irish playwright Martin McDonagh consume or refer to poitín, most notably the brothers in \"The Lonesome West\". In the Saga of Darren Shan book \"The Lake Of Souls\" the character Spits Abrams brews his own poitín. In Frank McCourt's book \"'Tis\", he recalls his mother Angela telling him that when his brother Malachy visited her in Limerick, he obtained poitín in the countryside and drank it with her.\n\n\"Déantús an Phoitín\"/\"Poteen Making\", by Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín, is a 1998 one-hour documentary film on the subject.\n\nThe first feature film to be made entirely in Irish was called \"Poitín\" (1979). The story involves an illegal distiller played by Cyril Cusack, his two agents, and his daughter in Connemara, in the remote west of Ireland.\n\nSome traditional Irish folk songs, such as \"The Hills of Connemara\" and \"The Rare Old Mountain Dew,\" deal with the subject of poitín. The persecution of the poitín-maker by the R.I.C. in 1880s Cavan is treated in \"The Hackler from Grouse Hall\" and its reply \"The Sergent's Lamentation\". In the first song, an overzealous sergeant pursued an ageing hackler with a fondness for poitín. Poitín is mentioned in the song \"Snake With Eyes of Garnet\" by Shane MacGowan and The Popes on their album The Snake. The song \"McIlhatton\" written by Bobby Sands and performed by Christy Moore is about a famous distiller of illegally made poitín.\n\nChristy Moore, Planxty and Damien Dempsey have each performed variations of this song available on YouTube. In the 1990s, a product known as The Hackler, an Irish poitín, was developed by Cooley Distillery. So popular was this song that the promotional literature originally referred incorrectly to a hackler as a maker of poitín. This error was subsequently corrected.\n\nGaelic Storm's song, \"Darcey's Donkey\" on the album \"What's the Rumpus?\" deals in a humorous way with the consequences of being caught distilling poitín by the Garda.\n\nIn the BBC television show, \"Ballykissangel\", Paul Dooley is sentenced to 50 hours of community service for serving poitín made by Uncle Minto, Donal, and Liam.\n\n\n"}

At that time, only large variations (\"macroscopic\" TWA) could be detected. Those large TWAs were associated with increased susceptibility to lethal ventricular tachycardias.\n\nMost modern references to TWA refer to microvolt T wave alternans (MTWA), a non-invasive heart test that can identify patients who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is most often used in patients who have had myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) or other heart damage to see if they are at high risk of developing a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia. Those who are found to be at high risk would therefore benefit from the placement of a defibrillator device which can stop an arrhythmia and save the patient's life.\n\nThe TWA test uses an electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement of the heart's electrical conduction using electrodes attached to one's torso. It takes approximately a half-hour to perform on an outpatient basis. The test looks for the presence of \"repolarization alternans\" (T-wave alternans), which is variation in the vector and amplitude of the T wave component of the EKG. The amount of variation is small, on the order of microvolts, so sensitive digital signal processing techniques are required to detect TWA. See also wikidoc article on TWA.\n\nMicrovolt T wave alternans is a variant of T wave alternans that detects T wave alternans signals as small as one-millionth of a volt. Microvolt T wave alternans is defined as an alternation in the morphology of the T wave in an every other beat or AB-AB pattern. It has long been associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. First recognized nearly a century ago, visually discernible alternans were linked to the rapid onset of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.\n\nResearch conducted in the early 1980s by Dr. Richard Cohen and his colleagues at MIT explored the idea that visually indiscernible alternans may be equally significant. These efforts established a link between visually imperceptible alternans at the microvolt level and susceptibility to arrhythmias and showed alternans to be a heart rate dependent phenomenon. In addition, Dr. Joseph Smith, working with Dr. Cohen developed a methodology known as the Spectral Method which allowed measurement of alternans at the level of one microvolt.\n\nMicrovolt T wave alternans testing acts as a risk stratifier between patients who need implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and those who do not. Patients who test negative for MTWA are less likely to require an ICD than those who test positive. In some cases, the test is equivalent to a more invasive electrophysiology (EP) study.\n\nMultiple prospective clinical trials indicate that patients from broad groups of at risk populations who test MTWA negative will likely live ventricular event-free for 12 to 24 months after their initial MTWA test.\n\nMTWA results are given as positive, negative, or indeterminate. Those with indeterminate results can be tested again. Otherwise, positive and indeterminate results are often lumped together when making clinical judgments about the likelihood of sudden cardiac death. In patients who have a negative (normal) MTWA test the risk of sudden cardiac death is very low. The Negative Predictive Value of MTWA testing has been shown to be 98% accurate for follow-up periods of 12–24 months in various clinical studies. Negative patients should be retested every 12 months as cardiac function can change over time.\n\nPatients who test MTWA positive or indeterminate for heart rate or dense ectopy (abnormal) should be referred to an electrophysiologist for further evaluation.\n\nPatients who have an indeterminate test should be retested immediately. Studies indicate that over 50% of patients who initially test as indeterminate, become determinate if retested during the same session.\n\nTwo methods are currently FDA-cleared to perform MTWA testing in the U.S., namely, the Spectral Method, which was developed by Cohen and Smith at M.I.T. and was commercialized by Cambridge Heart, and the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method, which was developed by Nearing and Verrier at Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and is commercialized by GE Healthcare. The Spectral Method requires a specialized exercise protocol and proprietary electrodes and washout of beta-adrenergic blocking agents to allow the patient to achieve a target heart rate of 105-110 beats/min. The MMA method uses routine, symptom-limited exercise stress testing or ambulatory ECG monitoring and standard electrodes and requires that chronic medications be retained. Both methods achieve 1-microvolt resolution. Interpretation of Spectral Method test results is described above. With the MMA method, risk is defined by the peak MTWA level, with cutpoints of 47µV and 60 µV for abnormal and severely abnormal risk, respectively. Quantification of TWA levels allows physicians to track patients' responses to medications and cardiac rehabilitation.\n\nOver 8000 subjects have been enrolled in Spectral Method studies that predicted outcomes, including the ALPHA study and the ABCD study. An additional 3145 (28% of total) subjects were enrolled in Spectral Method studies that did not predict outcomes, including the SCD-HeFT TWA substudy, the MASTER study, and the CARISMA study. Over 5000 patients have been enrolled in MMA studies, with >3500 in the FINCAVAS exercise-based series. The remaining 1500 patients were studied during ambulatory ECG monitoring. All MMA-based TWA studies have predicted outcomes. A head-to-head comparison of the Spectral and MMA methods revealed similar hazard ratios, kappa statistics, and areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curve. The MTWA consensus guideline, authored by 11 experts in both methods, described both methods, their history, and their utility. A trial of MTWA-guided ICD implantation, REFINE-ICD (NCT00673842), is underway. MTWA testing has been recommended for ventricular arrhythmia risk assessment by the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology and by CMS in National Coverage Analysis for Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (CAG-00157N).\n\nThis test is significant for insurance companies because it can potentially save thousands of dollars per patient by reducing the implantation of unnecessary implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD's). Use of the spectral method for measuring Microvolt T-wave Alternans has been approved for reimbursement by Medicare, as well as major insurers such as Aetna, Cigna, and Humana. The Spectral Method was FDA approved in 2001 and approved in 2006 for federal reimbursement by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), (CAG-00293N). The MMA method received federal approval for local CMS contractor reimbursement in 2015 (CAG-00293R2). Both methods use CPT code 93025.\n\nIn 2004 & 2005, NASA's Glenn Research Center and Cleveland's MetroHealth Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, teamed to investigate the value of MTWA testing for astronauts both pre- and during space flight. Experiments were performed both on the ground and on NASA's KC-135 aircraft.\n\n"}

In 1954, the original distillery closed down, and with stocks of whiskey running low, the brand was sold to John Powers & Son, another Irish distiller in the 1960s, with production transferred to the Midleton Distillery, County Cork in the 1970s following a merger of three major Irish distillers.\n\nIn 2010, the brand was purchased by William Grant & Sons, who constructed a new distillery on the outskirts of Tullamore. The new distillery opened in 2014, bringing production of the whiskey back to the town after a break of sixty years.\n\nIn 2012, a visitor centre was opened in a refurbished bonded warehouse previously belonging to the original distillery. The centre offers guided tours and tutored tastings ranging from 50 minutes to 5 hours in duration.\n\nThe origins of Tullamore D.E.W. date back to 1829, when a distillery was established in Tullamore by Michael Molloy. On his death, the distillery eventually passed to his nephew, Bernard Daly who later appointed Daniel E. Williams as the distillery's General Manager. Under Williams's watchful eye, the distillery expanded and prospered, launching the whiskey bearing his initials (D.E.W.), Tullamore D.E.W..\n\nIn 1954, the distillery ceased production, having, like many of those in Ireland at the time, been hit by declining sales due to a number of factors such as Prohibition, the Anglo-Irish Trade War and high taxes introduced by the Irish Free State.\n\nIn the 1960s, with whiskey stocks running low, rather than reopen the distillery, the owners opted to sell the brand to John Powers & Son, the Dublin distillers. In 1966, John Powers & Son merged with two other Irish distilleries to form Irish Distillers. In the 1970s, Irish Distillers closed their existing distilleries and consolidated production at a new distillery built in Midleton, County Cork.\n\nIn 1994, Irish Distillers, then concentrating their international focus on promoting Jameson Irish whiskey, sold the brand to the C&C Group. Subsequently, the C&C Group divested their entire liqueur and spirit business (including Tullamore D.E.W.), which was acquired by William Grant & Sons for €300 million in 2010. At which point, Tullamore D.E.W. was still being produced under license by at the Midleton Distillery. Therefore, as expansion of the brand was dependent on the availability of whiskey from Midleton, and with significant growth envisaged, William Grant & Sons opted to construct a new distillery in Tullamore, rather than depend on outsourced production.\n\nConstruction of the distillery is to take place on a phased basis. Phase one was completed in 2014, which saw production of whiskey return to Tullamore for the first time in sixty years. The new distillery has the capapability to produce both malt and pot still whiskey. However, it does not yet have a Coffey still installed to allow the production of grain whiskey. Therefore, as Tullamore D.E.W. is a blend of all three varieties of Irish whiskey, the grain whiskey component of the blend will continue to be sourced from Midleton until phase two is completed.\n\nAs of 2015, the whiskey sells about 950,000 cases per year (an amount that has doubled since 2005).\n\n a range of seven whiskeys are sold under the Tullamore D.E.W. brand:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Common active ingredients are salts of thioglycolic acid and thiolactic acids. These compounds break the disulfide bonds in keratin and also hydrolyze the hair so that it is easily removed. Formerly, sulfides such as strontium sulfide were used, but due to their unpleasant odor, they have been replaced by thiols.\n\nThe main chemical reaction effected by the thioglycolate is:\n\nChemical depilatories contain 5–6% calcium thioglycolate in a cream base (to avoid runoff). Calcium hydroxide or strontium hydroxide maintain a pH of about 12. Hair destruction requires about 10 minutes. Depilation is followed by careful rinsing with water, and various conditioners are applied to restore the skin's pH to normal. Depilation does not destroy the dermal papilla, and the hair grows back.\n\nChemical depilatories are available in gel, cream, lotion, aerosol, roll-on, and powder forms. Common brands include Nair, Magic Shave and Veet.\n\nDepilatory ointments, or plasters, were known to Greek and Roman authors as \"psilothrum\".\n"}

It was ground-tested in 2003 by NASA and was intended for use on the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, which was canceled in 2005.\n\nThe HiPEP thruster differs from earlier ion thrusters because the xenon ions are produced using a combination of microwave and magnetic fields. The ionization is achieved through a process called Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR). In ECR, the small number of free electrons present in the neutral gas gyrate around the static magnetic field lines. The injected microwaves' frequency is set to match this gyrofrequency and a resonance is established. Energy is transferred from the right-hand polarized portion of the microwave to the electrons. This energy is then transferred to the bulk gas/plasma via the rare - yet important - collisions between electrons and neutrals. During these collisions, electrons can be knocked free from the neutrals, forming ion-electron pairs. The process is a highly efficient means of creating a plasma in low density gases. Previously the electrons required were provided by a hollow cathode.\n\nThe thruster itself is in the 20-50 kW class, with a specific impulse of 6,000-9,000 seconds, and a propellant throughput capability exceeding 100 kg/kW. The goal of the project, as of June 2003, was to achieve a technology readiness level of 4-5 within 2 years.\n\nThe pre-prototype HiPEP produced 670 mN of thrust at a power level of 39.3 kW using 7.0 mg/s of fuel giving a specific impulse of 9620 s. Downrated to 24.4 kW, the HiPEP used 5.6 mg/s of fuel giving a specific impulse of 8270 s and 460 mN of thrust.\n\n\n"}

It has distinctive attributes, while sharing much with other Indian cuisines. Traditionally, Maharashtrians have considered their food to be more austere than others.\n\nMaharashtrian cuisine includes mild and spicy dishes. Wheat, rice, \"jowar\", \"bajri\", vegetables, lentils and fruit are dietary staples. Peanuts and cashews are often served with vegetables. Meat was traditionally used sparsely or only by the well off until recently, because of economic conditions and culture.\n\nThe urban population in metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Pune and others has been influenced from other parts of India and abroad. For example, the Udupi dishes \"idli\" and \"dosa,\" as well as Chinese and Western dishes, are quite popular in home cooking and in restaurants.\n\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include \"ukdiche modak\", aluchi patal bhaji and Thalipeeth.\n\nOccupying a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions produced a diverse cuisine.The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices.The majority of Maharashtrians eat meat and eggs, but the Brahmin community is mostly lacto-vegetarian.\n\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the Deccan plateau) is usually \"bhakri\", spiced cooked vegetables, \"dal\" and rice. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer \"roti\" or \"chapati\", which is a plain bread made with wheat flour.\n\nIn the coastal Konkan region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet coconut and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine. In South Konkan, near Malvan, another independent cuisine developed called Malvani cuisine, which is predominantly non-vegetarian. \"Kombdi vade\", fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\n\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy \"savji\"s, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\n\nLacto-vegetarian dishes are based on six main class of ingredients including grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.\n\nStaple dishes are based on a variety of flatbreads and rice. Flatbreads can be wheat-based, such as the traditional trigonal \"ghadichi poli\"  or the round \"chapati\" that is more common in urban areas. Bhakri is an unleavened bread made using from \"ragi\" or millet, \"bajra\" or \"bajri or\" \"jwari\" – and forms part of daily meals in rural areas.\n\nTraditionally, the staple grains of the inland Deccan plateau have been millets, \"jwari\"  and \"bajri\". These crops grow well in this dry and drought-prone region. In the coastal Konkan region the finger millet called \"ragi\" is used for \"bhakri\". The staple meal of the rural poor was traditionally as simple as \"bajra bhakri\" accompanied by just a raw onion, a dry chutney, or a gram flour preparation called \"jhunka\". This meal has now become popular as street food in Maharashtra.\n\nIncreased urbanization has increased wheat's popularity. Wheat is used for making flatbreads called chapati, trigonal \"ghadichi poli\" , the deep-fried version called puri or the thick paratha. Wheat is also used in many stuffed flatbreads such as Puran poli, Gul poli (with sesame and Jaggery stuffing), and Satorya (with sugar and khoya (dried milk)). Wheat flatbreads are also made with vegetable stuffings such as peas, potatoes and Gram dal. One of the ancient sought-after breads was Mande. As with rice, flatbreads accompany a meal of vegetables or dairy items.\n\nRice is the staple food in the rural areas of coastal Konkan region but is popular in all urban areas. Local varieties such as the fragrant \"ambemohar\" have been popular in Western Maharashtra. In most instances, rice is boiled on its own and becomes part of a meal that includes other items. A popular dish is varan bhaat where steamed rice is mixed with plain \"dal\" that is prepared with pigeon peas, lemon juice, salt and ghee. \"Khichdi\" is a popular rice dish made with rice, mung \"dal\" and spices. For special occasions, a dish called \"masalebhat\" made with rice, spices and vegetables is popular.\n\nMilk is important as a staple food. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used mainly for drinking, to add to tea or coffee or to make homemade dahi (yogurt).Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk.The yogurt is used as dressing for many salad or \"koshimbir\" dishes, to prepare cultured buttermilk or as a side dish in a \"thali\". Buttermilk is used in a drink called \"mattha\" by mixing it with spices. It may also be used in curry preparations.<ref name=\"CRC Press/Taylor & Francis\"></ref> Milk is also the starting material for butter and Ghee (clarified butter)\n\nUntil recently, canned or frozen food was not widely available in India. Therefore, the vegetables used in a meal widely depended on the season. For example, in Maharashtra, spring (March–May) is the season of cabbages, onions, potatoes, okra, \"guar and tondali\", \"shevgyachya shenga\", \"dudhi\", marrow and \"padwal\". During the Monsoon season (June–September) green leafy vegetables, such as \"aloo\" (Marathi: आळू), or gourds such as \"karle\", \"dodka\" and eggplant become available. Chili peppers, carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower, French beans and peas become available in the cooler climate of October to February.\nIn winter, Sorghum (Jwari) when still quite soft and green is used liked roasted corn by roasting the whole head on coal fire.\nVegetables are typically used in making \"bhaaji\"s. Some \"bhaaji\"s are made with a particular vegetable, while others are made with a combination. Bhaajis can be \"dry\" such as stir fry or \"wet\" as in the well-known curry. For example, fenugreek leaves can be used with\" mung dal\" or potatoes to make a dry \"bhhaji\" or mixed with \"besan\" flour and buttermilk to make a curry preparation. \"Bhaaji\" requires the use of \"goda masala\", consisting of a combination of onion, garlic, ginger, red chilli powder, green chillies, turmeric and mustard seeds. Depending on a family's caste or specific religious tradition, onions and garlic may be excluded. For example, a number of Hindu communities from many parts of India refrain from eating onions and garlic altogether during chaturmas, which broadly equals the monsoon season.\n\nLeafy vegetables such as fenugreek, amaranth, beetroot, radish, dill, colocasia, spinach, \"ambadi\", sorrel (Chuka in Marathi), \"chakwat\", safflower (Kardai in Marathi) and tandulja are either stir-fried (pale \"bhaaji\" ) or made into a soup (\"patal bhaaji\" ) using buttermilk and gram flour.\n\nMany vegetables are used in salad preparations called \"koshimbir\"s or \"raita\".<ref name=\"CRC Press/Taylor & Francis\"></ref> Most of these have dahi (yogurt) as the other main ingredient. Popular \"Koshimbir\"s include those based on radish, cucumber and tomato-onion combinations. Many \"raita\" require prior boiling or roasting of the vegetable as in the case of eggplant. Popular \"raita\" include those based on carrots, eggplant, pumpkin, \"dudhi\" and beetroot respectively.\n\nAlong with green vegetables, another class of popular food is various beans, either whole or split. Split beans are called \"dal\" and turned into \"amti\" (thin lentil soup), or added to vegetables such as \"dudhi\". \"Dal\" may be cooked with rice to make \"khichadi\". Whole beans are cooked as is or more popularly soaked in water until sprouted. Unlike Chinese cuisine, the beans are allowed to grow for only a day or two. Curries made out of sprouted beans are called \"usal\" and form an important source of proteins. The legumes popular in Maharastrian cuisine include peas, chick peas, \"mung\", \"matki\", \"urid\", kidney bean, black-eyed peas, \"kulith'' and \"toor\" (also called pigeon peas). Out of the above \"toor\" and chick peas are staples. The \"urid\" bean is the base for one of the most popular types of \"papadum''.\n\nPeanut oil and safflower oil are the primary cooking oils, although sunflower oil and cottonseed oil are also used. Clarified butter (called \"ghee\") is often used for its distinct flavor.\n\nDepending on region, religion and caste, Maharashtrian food can be mild to extremely spicy. Common spices include asafoetida, turmeric, mustard seeds, coriander, cumin, dried bay leaves, and chili powder. Spices used especially for \"garam masala\" include cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, cardamom and nutmeg.Other spice blends popular in the cuisine include goda masala and Kolhapuri masala. Common herbs to impart flavor or to garnish a dish include curry leaves, and coriander leaves. Many common curry recipes call for garlic, onion, ginger and green chilli pepper. Ingredients that impart sour flavor to the food include yoghurt, tomatoes, tamarind paste, \"amsul\" skin or unripe mangoes.\n\nChicken and goat are the most popular sources for meat in Maharashtrian cuisine. Eggs are popular and exclusively come from chicken sources. Beef and pork are mainly consumed by Christian minorities and some Dalit communities. However, these do not form part of traditional Maharashtrian cuisine.\n\nSeafood is a staple for many Konkan coastal communities. Most of the recipes are based on marine fish, prawns and crab. A distinct Malvani cuisine of mainly seafood dishes is popular. Popular fish varieties include Bombay duck, pomfret, \"bangda\" and \"surmai\" (kingfish). Seafood is used in recipes such as curries, pan-fried dishes and pilaf.\n\nOther ingredients include oil seeds such as flax, karale, coconut, peanuts, almonds and cashew nuts. Peanut powder and whole nuts are used in many preparations including, chutney, \"khosimbir\" and \"bhaaji\". More-expensive nuts (almonds and cashew) are used for sweet dishes. Flax and karale seeds are used in making dry chutneys. Traditionally, sugar cane based jaggery was used as the sweetening agent, but has been largely replaced by refined cane sugar. Fruit such as mango are used in many preparations including pickles, jams, drinks and sweet dishes. Bananas and jackfruit\nare also used in many dishes.\n\nUrban menus typically have wheat in the form of chapatis and plain rice as the main staples. Traditional rural households would have millet in form of \"bhakri\" on the Deccan plains and rice on the coast as respective staples.\n\nTypical breakfast items include \"misal\", \"pohe\", \"upma\", \"sheera\", \"sabudana khichadi\" and \"thalipeeth\". In some households leftover rice from the previous night is fried with onions, turmeric and mustard seeds for breakfast, making \"phodnicha bhat\". Typical Western breakfast items such as cereals, sliced bread and eggs, as well as South Indian items such as \"idli\" and \"dosa\" are also popular. Tea or coffee is served with breakfast.\n\nVegetarian lunch and dinner plates in urban areas carry a combination of:\n\n\nApart from bread, rice, and chutney, other items may be substituted. Families that eat meat, fish and poultry may combine vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, with rice and chapatis remaining the staples. Vegetable or non-vegetable items are essentially dips for the bread or for mixing with rice.\n\nTraditional dinner items are arranged in a circular way. With salt placed at 12 o'clock, pickles, \"koshimbir\" and condiments are placed anti-clockwise of the salt. Vegetable preparations are arranged in a clockwise fashion with a sequence of leafy greens curry, dry vegetables, sprouted been curry (\"usal\" ) and \"dal\". Rice is always on the periphery rather than in the center.\n\nIn the Konkan coastal area, boiled rice and \"rice bhakri\",\"nachni bhakri\" is the staple, with a combination of the vegetable and non-vegetable dishes described in the lunch and dinner menu.\n\nIn other areas of Maharashtra such as Desh, Khandesh, Marathwada and Vidarbha, the traditional staple was \"bhakri\" with a combination of \"dal\", and vegetables. The \"bhakri\" is increasingly replaced by wheat-based chapatis.\n\nOpen stove cooking is the most commonly used cooking method. The traditional three-stone \"chulha\" has largely been replaced by kerosene or gas stoves. A stove may be used for cooking in many different ways:\n\n\nOther methods of food preparation include:\n\nA number of dishes are made for religious occasions, dinner parties or as restaurant items or street food.\n\nMeat dishes are prepared in a variety of ways:\n\nSeafood is a staple for many communities that hail from the Konkan region. Popular dishes include:\n\n\nVarious vegetable curries or gravies are eaten with rice, usually at both lunch and dinner. Popular dishes include:\n\n\nIn Maharashtra,the traditional offering (for a guest) used to be water and jaggery (Gulpani). This has been replaced by tea or coffee. These beverages are served with milk and sugar. Occasionally, along with tea leaves, the brew may include spices, freshly grated ginger or lemon grass. Coffee is served with milk or ground nutmeg.\nOther beverages include:\n\nDesserts are an important part of festival and special occasion food. Typical sweets include , flatbread called \"puran poli\" with stuffed lentil and jaggery mix, a preparation made from strained yogurt, sugar and spices called \"shrikhand\", a sweet milk preparation made with evaporated milk called \"basundi\", semolina and sugar based \"kheer\" and steamed dumplings stuffed with coconut and jaggery called \"modak\". In some instances, the \"modak\" is deep-fried instead of steamed. Traditionally, these desserts were associated with a particular festival. For example, \"modak\" is prepared during the Ganpati Festival.\nOther sweets popular in Maharashtra and other regions of India include: \"kaju katli\", \"gulab jamun\", \"jalebi\", various kinds of \"barfi\", and \"rasmalai\".\n\nIn many metropolitan areas, including Mumbai and Pune, fast food is popular. The most-popular forms are \"bhaji\", \"vada pav\", \"misalpav\" and \"pav bhaji\". More-traditional dishes are \"sabudana khichadi\", \"pohe\", \"upma\", \"sheera\" and \"panipuri\". Most Marathi fast food and snacks are lacto-vegetarian.\n\nSome dishes, including \"sev bhaji\", \"misal pav\" and \"patodi\" are regional dishes within Maharashtra.\n\nMaharashtrian snacks and street foods are popular throughout the state, but most especially in Mumbai.\n\nLike most Indian cuisines, Maharashtrian cuisine is laced with lots of fried savories, including:\n\nThis festival falls on January 14 of the Gregorian calendar. Maharashtrians exchange \"tilgul\" or sweets made of jaggery and sesame seeds along with the customary salutation, \"tilgul ghya aani god bola\", which means \"Accept the \"tilgul\" and be friendly.\" \"Tilgul Poli\" or \"gulpoli\" are the main sweet preparations. It is a wheat-based flatbread filled with sesame seeds and jaggery.\n\nMarathi Hindu people fast on this day. Fasting food includes chutney prepared with pulp of the or \"kavath\" fruit (\"Limonia\"). Some communities use the pulp of Bael/.\n\nAs part of Holi, a festival that is celebrated on the full moon evening in the month of Falgun (March or April), a bonfire is lit to symbolize the end of winter and the slaying of a demon in Hindu mythology. People make \"puran poli\" as a ritual offering to the holy fire. The day after the bonfire night is called Dhulivandan. Marathi people celebrate with colors on the fifth day after the bonfire on Rangpanchami.\n\n\"Modak\" is said to be the favorite food of Ganesh. An offering of twenty-one pieces of this sweet preparation is offered on Ganesh Chaturthi and other minor Ganesh-related events. Various Maharashtrian communities prepare different dishes specially for Gauri poojan.\n\nDiwali is one of the most popular Hindu festivals. In Maharashtrian tradition family members have a ritual bath before dawn and then sit down for a breakfast of fried sweets and savory snacks called as Diwali Faral. These sweets and snacks are offered to visitors and exchanged with neighbors. Typical sweet preparations include \"ladu\", \"anarse\", shankarpali and \"karanjya\". Popular savory treats include \"chakli\", \"Shev\" and \"chiwda\". High in fat and low in moisture, these snacks can be stored at room temperature for many weeks without spoiling.\n\nMany Maharashtrian communities from all social levels observe the Khandoba Festival or \"Champa Shashthi\" in the month of Mārgashirsh. Households perform \"Ghatasthapana\" of \"Khandoba\" during this festival. The sixth day of the festival is called \"Champa Sashthi\". For many people, the \"Chaturmas\" period ends on \"Champa Sashthi\". It is customary for many families not to consume onions, garlic and eggplant during the Chaturmas. Following the festival, the consumption of these foods resumes with ritual preparation of \"vangyache bharit\" (\"baingan bharta\") with \"rodga\".\n\nThe traditional wedding menu among Maharashtrian Hindu communities used to be a lacto-vegetarian fare with mainly multiple courses of rice dishes with different vegetables and \"dal\"s. Some menus also included a course with \"puri\"s. In some communities, the first course was plain rice and the second was \"dal\" with masala rice.) The main meal typically ended with plain rice and \"mattha\". Some of the most-popular curries to go with this menu and with other festivals were those prepared from taro (Marathi: अलउ) leaves. Buttermilk with spices and coriander leaves, called \"mattha\", is served with the meal. Popular sweets for the wedding menu were \"shreekhand\", \"boondi ladu\" and \"jalebi\".\n\nMarathi Hindu people fast on days such as Ekadashi, in honour of Lord Vishnu or his Avatars, Chaturthi in honour of Ganesh, Mondays in honour of Shiva, or Saturdays in honour of Maruti or Saturn. Only certain kinds of foods are allowed to be eaten. These include milk and other dairy products (such as dahi), fruit and Western food items such as \"sago\", potatoes, purple-red sweet potatoes, amaranth seeds, nuts and \"varyache tandul\" (shama millet). Popular fasting dishes include \"Sabudana Khichadi\" or \"danyachi amti\" (peanut soup).\n\nEast Indian Christian Community of North Konkan also have their own special recipes for Christmas.Just like Goa, this includes pork vidaloo and sorpotel.A popular sweet for christmas includes Fogeas made out of flour , coconut milk, sugar and cottage cheese.

In reality, the spectacles merely create an optical illusion; no X-rays are involved. The current paper version is sold under the name \"X-Ray Spex\"; a similar product is sold under the name \"X-Ray Gogs\".\n\nX-Ray Specs consist of an outsized pair of glasses with plastic frames and white cardboard \"lenses\" printed with concentric red circles, and emblazoned with the legend \"X-RAY VISION\".\n\nThe \"lenses\" consist of two layers of cardboard with a small hole about a quarter-inch (6 millimeters) in diameter punched through both layers. The user views objects through the holes. A feather is embedded between the layers of each lens. The vanes of the feathers are so close together that light is diffracted, causing the user to receive two slightly offset images. For instance, if viewing a pencil, one would see two offset images of the pencil. Where the images overlap, a darker image is obtained, giving the illusion that one is seeing the graphite embedded within the body of the pencil.\n\nX-Ray Specs were long advertised with the slogan \"See the bones in your hand, see through clothes!\" Some versions of the advertisement featured an illustration of a young man using the X-Ray Specs to examine the bones in his hand while a voluptuous woman stood in the background, as though awaiting her turn to be \"X-rayed\".\n\nThe claim is untrue. Besides the unlikelihood of a safe and functional X-ray device selling for about a dollar, X-ray detectors require an X-ray \"generator\".\n\nPart or even most of the novelty value lies in provoking the object of the wearer's attentions. These subjects, if unable to be entirely sure that the device did not indeed allow the wearer to compromise their modesty, were liable to respond with a variety of amusing reactions.\nThe principle behind the illusion, as well as its use in a pair of \"spectacles\", was first patented (in the United States) in 1906 by George W. Macdonald (). A tubular configuration employing the same principle as well as the use of a feather for the diffraction grating was first patented in 1909 by Fred J.

The basic vegetables are onions, carrots, and potatoes. For the meat, beef, pork, and chicken are the most popular. \"Katsu-karē\" is a breaded deep-fried cutlet (usually pork or chicken) with curry sauce.\n\nAs curry was introduced to Japan via British cuisine, it was originally considered to be Western cuisine. This Western-style curry co-exists alongside Indian-style curry, which has become popular since the increase in Indian restaurants in the 1990s. Western-style curry is influenced by stews mixed with curry powder, which were popular amongst the British Royal Navy. The Imperial Japanese Navy adopted curry from the Royal Navy to prevent beriberi, and now the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's Friday menu is curry. The dish became popular and available for purchase in supermarkets and restaurants in the late 1960s. It has been adapted since its introduction to Japan, and is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish.\n\nCurry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) by the British, at the time when the Indian subcontinent was under the colonial rule of the British Raj. The recipes for curry in Japan were not those of Indian curries, but based on British curry powder, and were thought of as being of Western origin. In particular Crosse & Blackwell curry powder was what was imported into Japan. By the 1870s, curry began to be served in Japan, and became a staple within the Japanese diet. Becoming popular in the Japanese Army, it later became popular in school cafeterias. It only became popular in the Japanese Navy until the beginning of the 20th Century. By 2000, curry was a more frequent meal than sushi or tempura.\n\nCurry similar to that served in the Indian sub-continent, is known as Nakamuraya Curry. It was introduced to Japan by Rash Behari Bose when he began to sell curry at Nakamura Bakery.\n\n is served on top of cooked rice to make curry rice. Curry sauce is made by frying together curry powder, flour, and oil, along with other ingredients, to make roux; the roux is then added to stewed meat and vegetables, and then simmered until thickened. Adding potatoes to curry sauce was introduced by William S. Clark of the Sapporo Agricultural College, due to rice shortages at the time.\n\nIn Japanese homes, curry sauce is most commonly made from instant curry roux, which is available in block and powder forms, and contains curry powder, flour, oils and various flavorings. Ease of preparation, and the wide variety and availability of instant curry mixes, has made curry rice very popular, as it is very easy to make compared to many other Japanese dishes. Pre-made curry is available in vacuum-sealed bags that can be reheated in boiling water. For those who still make their curry roux from scratch, there are also curry powders specially formulated to create the \"Japanese curry\" taste.\n\nInstant curry roux was first sold in powder form by House Foods in 1926, and in block form by S&B Foods in 1956. In 2007, Japanese domestic shipments of instant curry roux was 82.7 billion yen. Market share for household use in 2007 was captured almost entirely by House Foods (59.0%), S&B Foods (25.8%) and Ezaki Glico (9.4%). Curry is marketed to children utilizing characters from video games and anime.\n\nVacuum-sealed curry sauce, prepared by heating the retort pouch in hot water or the microwave, is also popular. As of financial 2007, curry sauce is the largest single category of vacuum-sealed foods in Japan, making up over 30% of sales.\n\nCurry rice is usually served with fukujinzuke or rakkyō on the side.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, a number of regional specialty curries emerged, popularised as vacuum-sealed curry sauces. These include:\n\nLocal curries are also marketed to help boost tourism. Some varieties of this include , sold in Yokosuka to promote its heritage as a naval base, and in Tsuchiura to promote the Zeppelin landing in 1929.\n\nCurry was introduced to South Korea during the period of Japanese rule, and is popular there. It is often found at \"bunsik\" restaurants (diner-style establishments), donkkaseu-oriented restaurants, and at the majority of Japanese restaurants. Premade curry and powdered mixes are also readily available in supermarkets.\n\nJapanese-style curry was introduced to North Korea by Koreans and Japanese who were abducted from Japan to North Korea during the 1960s-1970s repatriation project. Along with other Japanese cuisine, it was traded by new arrivals for local products and used to bribe Worker's Party cadres.\n\nMixes can be found outside Japan and Korea in supermarkets that have a Japanese section or in Japanese or Asian food stores.\n\nThe largest Japanese curry company in Japan is House Foods Corporation. The company operates more than 10 Curry House Restaurants in the USA. Its associated company CoCo Ichibanya (Ichibanya Co., Ltd.) or Kokoichi has more than 1,200 restaurants in Japan. CoCo Ichibanya has branches in Hawaii (USA), California (USA), China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand.\n\nJapanese curry rice is served in anything from a flat plate to a soup bowl. The curry is poured over rice in any manner and amount. Japanese short grain rice, which is sticky and round, is preferred, rather than the medium grain variety used in Indian dishes. It is usually eaten with a spoon, as opposed to chopsticks, because of the liquid nature of the curry, and is usually served garnished with vegetables pickled in vinegar such as fukujinzuke or rakkyo.\n\n"}

The juice drink is sold in a concentrated state. \n\nThe brand takes its name from \"kia ora\", a Māori language greeting which has entered New Zealand English, which literally means \"be well/healthy\". The first Kia-Ora was a lemon squash sold by Arthur Gasquoine in Sydney, Australia, in 1903. The brand was sold to the Dixon Family in the same year, with the first factory being established by Roland Dixon in Prahran in Melbourne. The original factory chimney still exists and is now a heritage-listed building. The first bottle off the production line is still in the hands of the Dixon family, as is the original recipe for Chilli Cordial, one of the first flavours launched, alongside orange and lemon flavours. Kia-Ora was launched in Great Britain in 1917 in orange and lemon flavours.\n\nThe success of Kia-Ora prompted the Dixon family to expand the range of its drinks, and that led to many other flavours emerging: orange mixed fruit, raspberry, and pear were just a handful of the flavours created in the ever-expanding range. No-added-sugar variants were also created. Kia-Ora continued to prosper throughout the 20th century, with the World Wars only affecting the brand slightly in terms of production. The brand remained popular amongst children aged 3-10 in both Australia and the United Kingdom. From 1953, Kia-Ora was advertising with full-colour posters. In 1961, Kia-Ora was sold to the Campbell Soup Company of the US.\n\nThe brand became popular in the 1970s within the UK. It was widely available in cinemas as a ready-to-drink product in cartons, paired with an advertisement spoofing the Columbia Pictures logo. In 1982, Kia-Ora launched a colourful, animated advertising campaign, directed by Oscar Grillo of Klacto Animations, which used the jingle \"We all adore a Kia-Ora\", and featured a child in a straw hat, a dog called Fedora who served the drink, and multiple crows who pursued the boy for a drink, with the boy responding with \"it's too orangey for crows\". Later promotions included Caramba's song \"Fido\", and the jingle was referred to in the Spaced episode \"Gone\". The advertisements attracted a degree of controversy in later years, with claims of implicit racism, because the boy looked similar to a golliwog. The brand was refreshed in 1987, with a series of advertisements directed by Geoff Dunbar, featuring redesigned characters, the introduction of the boy's chubby father, and new variations on the jingle.\n\nThe success of the Kia-Ora brand subsequently declined, overtaken by rival juice producers such as Robinsons. Coca-Cola eventually discontinued all variations except sugar-free orange and sugar-free mixed fruit. The advertising campaigns that Kia-Ora had been relying on for over 50 years had also been failing, due to criticism from the public that the brand was built on negative values such as racism.\n\n"}

Baati is commonly eaten with dal, hence also referred to as dal baati. In some regions, especially Madhya Pradesh, it is also paired with a roasted aubergine mash called bharta. Baati is also closely related to litti (cuisine), popular in eastern Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi) and western Bihar. \"Litti\" potato, tomato and roasted aubergine).\n\nBaati can either be plain or have various kinds of fillings, including onions, peas, and \"sattu\". \"Bafla\" is a kind of baati, which is softer. Bafla and baati are always eaten with hot dal with pure ghee and chutney.\n\n\"Churma\" is a popular delicacy usually served with \"baatis\" and dal. It is coarsely ground wheat crushed and cooked with ghee clarified butter and sugar.

Unagi is a common ingredient in Japanese cooking, often as kabayaki. It is not to be confused with saltwater eel, which is known as anago in Japanese.\n\nUnagi is served as part of \"unadon\" (sometimes spelled \"unagidon\", especially in menus in Japanese restaurants in Western countries), a \"donburi\" dish with sliced eel served on a bed of rice. A kind of sweet biscuit called \"unagi pie\" made with powdered unagi also exists. Unagi is high in protein, vitamin A, and calcium.\n\nSpecialist unagi restaurants are common in Japan, and commonly have signs showing the word \"unagi\" with hiragana う (transliterated \"u\"), which is the first letter of the word \"unagi\". Lake Hamana in Hamamatsu city, Shizuoka prefecture is considered to be the home of the highest quality unagi; as a result, the lake is surrounded by many small restaurants specializing in various unagi dishes. Unagi is often eaten during the hot summers in Japan. There is even a special day for eating unagi, the midsummer day of the Ox (doyo no ushi no hi).\n\n\"Unakyu\" is a common expression used for sushi containing eel & cucumber. As eel is poisonous unless cooked, eels are always cooked, and in Japanese food, are often served with tare sauce. Unagi that is roasted without tare and only seasoned with salt is known as \"Shirayaki.\"\n\nSeafood Watch, a sustainable seafood advisory list, recommends that consumers avoid eating unagi due to significant pressures on worldwide freshwater eel populations. All three eel species used as unagi have seen their population sizes greatly reduced in the past half century. For example, catches of the European Eel have declined about 80% since the 1960s. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment has officially added Japanese eel to the “endangered” category of the country’s Red List of animals ranging from “threatened” to “extinct”.\n\nAlthough about 90% of freshwater eel consumed in the U.S. are farm-raised, they are not bred in captivity. Instead, young eels are collected from the wild and then raised in various enclosures. In addition to wild eel populations being reduced by this process, eels are often farmed in open net pens which allow parasites, waste products, and diseases to flow directly back into wild eel habitat, further threatening wild populations. Freshwater eels are carnivores and as such are fed other wild-caught fish, adding another element of unsustainability to current eel farming practices.\n"}

The toffee tastes very strongly of molasses (black treacle), and cheap versions can be quite bitter. In Scotland, the treat is known as claggum, with less sweet versions known as clack. In Wales, it is known as loshin du. (losin du or taffi triog). The flavour is similar to that of butterscotch, although it is a toffee and never a viscous liquid.\n\nThe use of molasses (or treacle) in the United Kingdom began in the 1660s, when it was first used to make gingerbread. Bonfire toffee emerged soon thereafter. But treacle was considered medicinal at the time and therefore very expensive, limiting the spread of toffee as a dessert or snack food. The term \"toffee\" did not appear in print until 1825 although foods were often being cooked several decades before their names or recipes for them appeared in print. Toffee developed in northern England some decades earlier (perhaps by the mid-18th century), and had displaced formerly popular sweets such as candied fruit, fruit preserves, marmalade, and similar items. Toffee was widely popular by 1800. At this time, toffee took many forms, including a soft version much like taffy, and was often called \"toughy\" or \"tuffy.\" It was also known as \"treacle sweetmeat,\" the suffix \"-meat\" having the meaning of any food. However, it is not entirely clear as to why it became associated with Guy Fawkes Night.\n\nFrom about 1830 to 1900, bonfire toffee was quite popular in Yorkshire. In the 1890s, it was sometimes called \"Tom Trot.\" Bonfire toffee was usually a homemade confectionery. Although industrial manufacturing of confectionery had begun in the 1840s, the price of black treacle in the 1890s and first decade of the 20th century often rose above the price of sugar which made store-bought toffee too expensive for many. Even in the 1960s, it was common for older people in a neighbourhood to make bonfire toffee to hand out to children on Guy Fawkes Night.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, bonfire toffee was often made in large sheets and pieces broken off with a toffee hammer. This practice was discouraged by some due to concerns about food safety. Treacle toffee was once common in sweet shops, but in the late 20th century was usually only available in supermarkets in October and November. However, it is still available year-round in speciality sweet shops, where it is usually broken by hand and wrapped in paper. It may be purchased as a sort of lollipop, on a stick with the foil dish it was made in still attached, or in sheets for breaking up and consuming at home.\n\nBonfire toffee is primarily consumed in the northern part of the United Kingdom, where sweets darker in colour are preferred.\n\nAlthough bonfire toffee is usually considered a Halloween or Guy Fawkes Night treat, it has a Christmas association as well. In Wales, an old tradition exists of \"plygain,\" a Christian worship service held between 3:00– 6:00 a.m. in which Christmas carols are sung (and sometimes, but not always, accompanied by holy communion). After \"plygain\" was over, people would stay awake to decorate the house, play cards, eat cake or pikelets (a variation of the crumpet), or make bonfire toffee.\n\nThe ingredients often include butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses is the critical ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for of butter, of treacle, and of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked over medium heat until melted, and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling for the use of vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for of dark brown sugar, of molasses, one tablespoon () of vinegar, one tablespoon () of butter, and one teaspoon () of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.\n\nIt can be cut or rolled into sticks while still warm. Some recipes call for essence of almond, lemon, or peppermint to be added for flavour, or for cayenne pepper to be added to give it a spicy kick.\n\nGenerally speaking, little fat is used in the mixture, and the moisture content of the food is low. Food colouring (usually dark brown or black colour) is used in cheaper versions, when not enough treacle is present in the mixture to turn the toffee a dark colour.\n\nBy one estimate, of bonfire toffee has , of protein, of carbohydrates, of fat, and of dietary fibre.\n\n\n"}

The front brake cable can be routed through the stem, via a hollow stem bolt known as a Pott's mod bolt, and fork steer tube to avoid the tangling problem.\n\nThe single cable from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to opposite sides of the stem or fork steer tube and into cable stops. The inner cables connect to metal tabs on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. Squeezing the brake lever pulls the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached to the bottom of the thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through cable stops mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.\n\nA simpler, less common variation of the system, termed a \"dual cables\" brake, does away with the splitters for the upper and lower cables, instead simply running two cables from the brake lever to the detangler and from there to the brake. While this may improve reliability, it may need more maintenance.\n\n\n\n"}

Traditional sugar plums contained no fruit, but were instead hardened sugar balls. These hardened sugar balls were comfits, and often surrounded a seed, nut, or spice.\n\nThe term sugar plum came into general usage in the 17th century. At that time, adding layers of sweet which give sugar plums and comfits their hard shell was done through a slow and labour-intensive process called panning. Until the mechanization of the process, it often took several days, and thus the sugar plum was largely a luxury product. In fact, in the 18th century the word plum became British slang for a large pile of money or a bribe. However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized rotating pans, and it was then available for mass consumption.\n\nToday, some candy manufacturers have taken \"sugar plum\" literally, creating plum-flavored, plum-shaped candies and marketing them as \"sugar plum candy\". \n\nAnother 21st-century take on the \"sugar plum\" instructs home cooks to combine dried fruits and almonds with honey and aromatic seeds (anise, fennel, caraway, cardamom), form this mixture into balls, then coat in sugar or shredded coconut.\n\nSugar plums are widely associated with Christmas, through cultural phenomena such as the Sugar Plum Fairy in \"The Nutcracker\" (Composed by Tchaikovsky, 1892), as well as the line \"Visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,\" from Clement C. Moore's poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (1823), better known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\".\n\nIn the children's board game Candy Land the character Plumpy, a gingerbread troll, wore a sugar plum around his neck. Receiving the Plumpy card meant the player had to undo most of their progress, which could lead to great frustration and often prolonged the game. The Plumpy character was replaced in 2002 by Mama Gingertree.\n\nSugar plums have also gained widespread recognition through the poem \"\"The Sugar Plum Tree\"\" by Eugene Field. The poem begins \"Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?

Swine were prohibited in ancient Syria and Phoenicia, and the pig and its flesh represented a taboo observed, Strabo noted, at Comana in Pontus. A lost poem of Hermesianax, reported centuries later by the traveller Pausanias, reported an etiological myth of Attis destroyed by a supernatural boar to account for the fact that \"in consequence of these events the Galatians who inhabit Pessinous do not touch pork\". Concerning Abrahamic religions, clear restrictions exist in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut) and in Islamic dietary laws (Halal).\n\nAlthough Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, most of its adherents are permitted to consume pork – justified by Peter's vision of a sheet with animals and several verses of the New Testament which guides Christians with the Good News of the Gospels. Since Christianity lost most of its roots from Judaism, Christians are not bound to some restrictions of Mosaic Law. However, Seventh-day Adventists consider pork taboo, along with other foods forbidden by Jewish law. The Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church do not permit pork consumption.\n\nMany Yazidis in Kurdistan regard pork as forbidden.\n\nThe Torah (Pentateuch) contains passages in Leviticus that lists the animals people are permitted to consume. It first notes what qualifies an animal that is absolutely permitted:\n\nAnimals that have cloven hooves and chew their cud are ruminants such as cows, sheep, and deer. This text does not specify every possible animal by name, only their behaviors. \n\nThe text goes on to describe specific animals that are known and meet one, but not both, of those qualifications, thereby prohibiting their consumption. It does not elaborate on the exact reason for prohibition other than physical characteristics. \n\nPigs are described in this section as prohibited because they have a cloven hoof but don't chew their cud.\n\nDeuteronomy expands on the list of permitted animals.\n\nDeuteronomy reiterates what Leviticus states on pigs.\n\nOne example of verses from the Quran on pig consumption:\n\nThe prohibition of certain food is also linked to Islamic Cosmology. Accordingly \"good\" and \"evil\" qualities are transferred by eating an object carrying a certain quality, that also affects the soul of human, the pig rendered with \"evil qualities\".\n\nScottish pork taboo was Donald Alexander Mackenzie's phrase for discussing an aversion to pork among Scots, particularly Highlanders, which he believed stemmed from an ancient taboo. Several writers who confirm that there was a prejudice against pork, or a superstitious attitude toward pigs, do not see it in terms of a taboo related to an ancient cult. Any prejudice is generally agreed to have disappeared by 1800.\n\nThe cultural materialistic anthropologist Marvin Harris thinks that the main reason for prohibiting consumption of pork was ecological-economical. Pigs require water and shady woods with seeds, but those conditions are scarce in the Middle East. Unlike many other forms of livestock, pigs are omnivorous scavengers, eating virtually anything they come across, including carrion and refuse. This was deemed unclean; and a Middle Eastern society keeping large stocks of pigs would destroy their ecosystem. \n\nExtrapolating all of this into a modern scientific context, one could surmise that the very close relationship between humans and pigs also makes them undesirable as food.\n\nIt is speculated that chickens supplanted pigs as a more portable and efficient source of meat, leading to the religious restrictions.\n\nMaimonides, the Jewish philosopher and legal codifier, who was also court physician to the Muslim sultan Saladin in the 12th century, understands the dietary laws chiefly as a means of keeping the body healthy. He argued that the meat of the forbidden animals, birds, and fish is unwholesome and indigestible. According to Maimonides, at first glance, this does not apply to pork, which does not appear to be harmful. Yet, Maimonides observes, the pig is a filthy animal and if swine were used for food, marketplaces and even houses would be dirtier than latrines.\n\nRashi (the primary Jewish commentator on the Bible and Talmud) lists the prohibition of pig as a law whose reason is not known, and may therefore be derided by others as making no sense.\n\nThe Chinuch Sefer HaChinuch (an early work of Halachah) gives a general overview of the Jewish dietary laws. He writes \"And if there are any reasons for the dietary laws which are unknown to us or those knowledgeable in the health field, do not wonder about them, for the true Healer that warns us against them is smarter than us, and smarter than the doctors\".\n\n\n"}

Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, chard, kale, cabbage and similar leafy green vegetables served along with this dish are supposed to further add to the wealth, since they are the color of American currency. Another traditional food, cornbread, can also be served to represent wealth, being the color of gold. On the day after New Year's Day, leftover \"Hoppin' John\" is called \"Skippin' Jenny\" and further demonstrates one's frugality, bringing a hope for an even better chance of prosperity in the New Year.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\"'s first reference to the dish is from Frederick Law Olmsted's 19th century travelogue, \"A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States\" (1861). However, a recipe for \"Hopping John\" in \"The Carolina Housewife\" by Sarah Rutledge, which was published in 1847, is also cited as the earliest reference. An even earlier source is \"Recollections of a Southern Matron\", which mentions \"Hopping John\" (defined, in a note, as \"bacon and rice\") as early as 1838. The origins of the name are uncertain; one possibility is that the name is a corruption of the Haitian Creole term for black-eyed peas: pois pigeons (), or \"pigeon peas\" in English.\n\nHoppin' John was originally a Low Country food before spreading to the entire population of the South. Hoppin' John may have evolved from rice and bean mixtures that were the subsistence of enslaved West Africans en route to the Americas. Hoppin' John has been further traced to similar foods in West Africa, in particular the Senegalese dish \"thiebou niebe\".\n\nOne tradition common in the United States is that each person at the meal should leave three peas on their plate to ensure that the New Year will be filled with luck, fortune and romance. Another tradition holds that counting the number of peas in a serving predicts the amount of luck (or wealth) that the diner will have in the coming year. On Sapelo Island in the community of Hog Hammock, Geechee red peas are used instead of black-eyed peas. Sea Island red peas are similar.\n\nAmerican chef Sean Brock claims that traditional Hoppin' John was made with Carolina gold rice, once thought to be extinct, and Sea Island red peas. He has worked with farmers to re-introduce this variety of rice. As of 2017, several rice growers offer Carolina gold rice.\n\nOther bean and rice dishes are seen throughout the American South and the Caribbean, and are often associated with African culinary influence in the Americas. Regional variants include the Guyanese dish \"cook-up rice\", which uses black-eyed peas and coconut milk; \"Hoppin' Juan,\" which substitutes Cuban black beans for black-eyed peas; the Peruvian tacu-tacu; and the Brazilian dish baião-de-dois, which also often uses black-eyed peas.\n\n\n"}

Most locals refer to it as kremšnita, from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning. While the kremna rezina from Bled celebrated their 10th million piece production, Slaščičarna Lenček, which is located in Domžale, in year 2013 celebrated the 75th anniversary since they have made their first one which is called Lenčkova kremna rezina.\n\nIn Croatia, the two most popular variants are Samoborska kremšnita from the town of Samobor and Zagrebačka kremšnita from the capital, Zagreb.

The term is no longer as widely used in Japanese as it once was: Japanese horror books and films such as \"Ju-on\" and \"Ring\" would more likely be labeled by the katakana or the standard Japanese . \"Kaidan\" is only used if the author/director wishes to specifically bring an old-fashioned air into the story.\n\nKaidan entered the vernacular during the Edo period, when a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular. This game led to a demand for ghost stories and folktales to be gathered from all parts of Japan and China.\n\nThe popularity of the game, as well as the acquisition of a printing press, led to the creation of a literary genre called \"Kaidanshu.\"\n\n\"Kaidanshu\" were originally based on older Buddhist stories of a didactic nature, although the moral lessons soon gave way to the demand for strange and gruesome stories.\n\n\n\nThe word was popularised in English by Lafcadio Hearn in his book \"\". The spelling kwaidan is a romanization based on an archaic spelling of the word in kana - Hearn used it since the stories in the book were equally archaic. The revised Hepburn romanization system is spelled kaidan.\n\nWhen film director Masaki Kobayashi made his portmanteau film \"Kwaidan\" (1964) from Hearn's translated tales, the old spelling was used in the English title.\n\nOriginally based on didactic Buddhist tales, kaidan often involve elements of karma, and especially ghostly vengeance for misdeeds. Japanese vengeful ghosts (\"Onryō\") are far more powerful after death than they were in life, and are often people who were particularly powerless in life, such as women and servants.\n\nThis vengeance is usually specifically targeted against the tormentor, but can sometimes be a general hatred toward all living humans. This untargeted wrath can be seen in \"Furisode\", a story in Hearn's book \"In Ghostly Japan\" about a cursed kimono that kills everyone who wears it. This motif is repeated in the film \"Ring\" with a videotape that kills all who watch it, and the film \"Ju-on\" with a house that kills all who enter it.\n\nKaidan also frequently involve water as a ghostly element. In Japanese religion, water is a pathway to the underworld as can be seen in the festival of Obon.\n\n\n"}

Soldiers serving with Cavalry units (referred to as \"Troopers\") are inducted into the Order of the Spur after successfully completing a \"Spur Ride\" or for having served during combat as a member of or with a Cavalry unit. A trooper who has earned both Silver and Gold spurs is known as a \"Master Spur Holder.\" Traditionally, each Trooper is presented spurs by his sponsor at a ceremonial dining in commonly referred to as the \"Spur Dinner\". The spurs are to be worn with the military uniform during Squadron or Regimental ceremonies and events or as designated by the Cavalry unit commander. In some units, gold spurs are awarded for combat inductions while silver spurs represent having completed the Spur Ride. Within the tradition, silver spurs and gold spurs hold a similar relationship for the cavalry as the Expert Infantryman Badge hold in the U.S. Army Infantry, as well as the Expert Field Medical Badge and the Combat Medical Badge hold to U.S. Army Medics. There is no Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) requirement for the Order of the Spur and the order is open to members of foreign militaries serving with U.S. Cavalry units.\n\nThe tradition of having to \"earn your spurs\" reaches back to the beginning of the American Cavalry. When green Troopers first arrived at their new cavalry assignments they were assigned a horse with a shaved tail. This led to the nickname \"Shave Tail\" for newly assigned, spur-less Soldiers. These new Troopers were in need of extensive training in all areas of horsemanship. The horse with a shaved tail was given extra space in which to operate since its rider was marked as a novice. New Troopers were given the “Prince of Wales Spurs” because they may misuse or overuse the actual rawel of real spurs, injuring the horse. Only when they were able to prove their ability to perform with their horse and saber were they awarded spurs.\n\nThe Spur Ride is the only means of joining the Order of the Spur, aside from a wartime induction. The conduct of a Spur Ride varies but it is generally an event held over multiple days during which a Trooper must pass a series of physical and mental tests relevant to the Cavalry. Some of the tests evaluate leadership, technical and tactical proficiency, physical fitness, the ability to operate as part of a team under high levels of stress and fatigue under both day and night conditions, though the specific tests vary by unit. A written test is often also administered, with questions that cover United States Cavalry and unit history. During the Spur Ride, candidates are also often required to recite from memory the traditional cavalry poem, \"Fiddler's Green\", or other traditions or historical information pertaining to the Cavalry.\n\nThe criteria for participation in the Spur Ride are set by each Cavalry unit, usually at the Squadron level. Many units require demonstrated leadership ability through planning and conducting unit-level training events such as gunnery ranges, soldier task training or other non-commissioned and commissioned officer-level tasks. Some examples of minimum criteria are:\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the Spur Ride, new spur holders are welcomed with a formal induction ceremony. The ceremony is a dining in, called the Spur Dinner, that often includes other military traditions such as honoring lost comrades, a ceremonial punch (called a grog), and a roll call of the successful candidates. Some units also hold a \"hero's breakfast\" immediately following the end of the Spur Ride. During the breakfast, the unit commander presents a toast welcoming the successful candidates to the brotherhood prior to the formal induction ceremony.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Army classifies the Order of the Spur as an Army tradition, so regulations for induction into the Order of the Spur and the wear of cavalry accoutrements are set by each cavalry unit commander. Lacking any Army-wide regulations, standards differ from unit to unit, but the tradition remains the same. What follows is one example of a Cavalry Squadron's policy on the wear of Stetsons and Spurs:\n\nWhile the regulations governing the order of the spur are set by each cavalry commander (and so do not appear in the Army Regulation governing wear and appearance of uniforms and insignia), the practice falls under what the Army officially recognizes as a tradition. The following is from Field Manual 7-21.13 (The Soldier's Guide, dated 15 OCT 2003):\n\nLike the Order of the Spur, the Cavalry Stetson is an Army Tradition and regulated by a soldier's unit commander. However, unlike the Order of the Spur, the Cavalry Stetson is usually worn by a Trooper immediately upon their assignment to a Cavalry unit. While the Cavalry Stetson holds a similar status to the Order of the Spur, for members of the cavalry the awarding and wear of the Cavalry Stetson is distinct from the awarding and wear of spurs. The cord around the Stetson, used to be used to assist with securing the Scouts’ horse to a object while the Soldier dismounted. Knots in the cord by the Acorns of the cord represented combat. Every half knot represented 1 single Combat Campaign. After two knots were given on a single Stenson, he became the ‘SME’ (Subject Matter Expert) on the battlefield.\n\nOn April Fools' Day, 2011, the U.S. Army released a humorous statement that the official black beret of the Army would be replaced by stetsons. Below is an excerpt from the full announcement:\n\nThe statement was supplemented by pictures of soldiers with stetsons photoshopped over their berets, including an Army dog toting a stetson.\n\n\n"}

In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as \"Jause\". In other Spanish-speaking countries, almuerzo means lunch, but in Spain it is a second breakfast. It is typical to eat four to five meals a day in these locations.\n\nThe second breakfast is typically a lighter meal or snack eaten around 10:30 in the morning (its Hungarian and Slovak name, \"tízórai\" / \"desiata\", actually means \"[snack] at 10\"). It consists of coffee and pastries or some sausages. The typical sausage is a white sausage, Weißwurst, which is considered the specialty of Munich and Bavaria in general. The sausage is prepared during the early morning to serve during the second breakfast. It is served with pretzels, sweet mustard, and wheat beer. The meal is roughly similar in concept to the British elevenses. In Poland second breakfast usually consists of some snacks like sandwiches, or pastries, but may consist of light dessert-type dishes like chocolate pudding or kisiel.\n\nFirst and second breakfast is also a common custom in farm areas of North America. Farmers who need to rise early to tend to animals or perform other chores may eat a small \"first breakfast\", such as toast and coffee, just after rising, followed by a heartier second breakfast after the first round of chores is done.\n\nIn J. R. R. Tolkien's novel \"The Hobbit\", the protagonist Bilbo Baggins eats a second breakfast, and in the preface to its sequel, \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien mentions that hobbits prefer to eat seven meals a day. In Peter Jackson's , as Aragorn is leading the hobbits on a march, Pippin – hoping for a meal break – is horrified when Merry tells him that the man probably doesn't know about second breakfast. Pippin goes on to ask if he knows about the other meals commonly eaten by hobbits, including elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper. Aragorn throws an apple to each of the pair to tide them over until their next \"regular\" meal break. This event occurs during the film version. However, in the book Hobbits are specifically described to eat \"six meals a day (when they c[an] get them)\", not seven.\n\nIn Thomas Mann's books \"The Magic Mountain\" or \"Buddenbrooks\", frequent and detailed references are made to second breakfasts. Sometimes food from the first breakfast appears again such as oatmeal and fruit. In fact, in \"Magic Mountain\", Mann even refers to \"third breakfasts\".\n\nThe \"second breakfast\" is referenced in the American version of \"The Office\", in the season 6 episode \"The Delivery\", by \"Kevin\": \"Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times so we've been eating together a lot.

As this is a Thai curry based on coconut milk and fresh green chillies, the color comes out creamy mild green or, as this color is called in Thai, \"sweet green\". Its ingredients are not exactly fixed. The curry is not necessarily sweeter than other Thai curries but, although the spiciness varies, it tends to be more pungent than the milder red curries. Green curry evolved during the reign of King Rama 6 or Rama 7, between the years 1908-1926.\n\nApart from a main protein, traditionally fish, fish balls, or meat, the other ingredients for the dish consist of coconut milk, green curry paste, palm sugar, and fish sauce. Thai eggplant (aubergine), pea aubergine, or other green or whitish vegetables and even fruit are often included. The consistency of its sauce varies with the amount of coconut milk used. Green curry paste is traditionally made by pounding in a mortar green chillies, shallots, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime peel, cilantro roots (coriander), and cumin seeds, white peppercorns, shrimp paste and salt.\n\nThe paste is fried in split coconut cream until the oil is expressed to release the aromas in the paste. Once the curry paste is cooked, more coconut milk and the remaining ingredients are added along with a pinch of palm sugar and fish sauce. Finally, as garnishes, Thai basil, fresh kaffir lime leaves, sliced \"phrik chi faa\" (\"sky-pointing chilies\", large mild chilies) are often used. For a more robust green curry, such as with seafood, julienned krachai (fingerroot/wild ginger/Chinese keys), white turmeric, and holy basil can be used as garnishes.\n\nGreen curry is typically eaten with rice as part of a wider range of dishes in a meal, or with round rice noodles known as \"khanom chin\" as a single dish.

They frequently made trips to visit the Sioux and they often returned home with gifts. During one particular trip one of the sons was killed in a quarrel over a Sioux woman. The remaining three brothers returned home for a short while, then returned to the Sioux, convinced the death of their brother was a mistake. However, upon this trip, only one brother returned home to his father safely. The last son, filled with forgiveness, went to seek the Sioux and reconcile their differences, but only met his death in the Sioux village.\n\nFor two years after, the father hunted and worked hard to obtain enough ammunition and supplies to raid the Sioux village and seek his revenge.

It can refer simply to fried pre-cooked rice, a meal including stir fried rice in a small amount of cooking oil or margarine, typically spiced with \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce), shallot, garlic, ground shrimp paste, tamarind and chilli and accompanied by other ingredients, particularly egg, chicken and prawns. There is also another kind of \"nasi goreng\" which is made with \"ikan asin\" (salted dried fish) which is also popular across Indonesia. \"Nasi goreng\" is sometimes described as Indonesian stir-fried rice, although it is also popular in Southeast Asia. Beyond the Malay Archipelago, it has gained popularity through Indonesian influence in Sri Lanka and via Indonesian immigrant communities in Suriname and the Netherlands. It is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavor, owed to generous amount of caramelized sweet soy sauce and powdered shrimp paste, and the taste is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" has been called the national dish of Indonesia, though there are many other contenders. It can be enjoyed in simple versions from a tin plate at a roadside food stall, eaten on porcelain in restaurants, or collected from the buffet tables of Jakarta dinner parties.\n\nIn 2011 an online poll by 35,000 people held by CNN International chose Indonesian \"nasi goreng\" as number two on their 'World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods' list after rendang.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" had the same beginnings as other versions of fried rice; as a way to avoid wasting rice. Frying the rice could prevent the propagation of dangerous microbes, especially in pre-refrigeration technology Indonesia and also avoid the need to throw out precious food. \"Nasi goreng\" is traditionally served at home for breakfast and it is traditionally made out of leftover rice from the night before. Besides ingredients like shallot, tomato, pepper and chili, the rice is fried with scraps of chicken or beef; usually leftovers from a chicken or beef dish.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is often described as Indonesia's twist on fried rice. And as with other fried rice recipes in Asia, it has been suggested that it can trace its origin from Southern Chinese fried rice. However, it is not clear when Indonesians began to adopt the Chinese fried rice and create their own version. The trade between China and the Indonesian archipelago flourished from the era of Srivijaya around the 10th century and intensified in the Majapahit era around the 15th century. By that time Chinese immigrants had begun to settle in the archipelago, bringing along with them their culture and cuisine. Chinese people usually favor freshly cooked hot food, and in their culture it is taboo to throw away uneaten foodstuffs. As a result, the previous day's leftover rice was often recooked in the morning. Previously, Indonesians probably simply sun-dried the leftover rice to make \"intip\" or \"rengginang\" (rice cracker), the dried rice also could be ground to make rice flour.\n\nThe Chinese influences upon Indonesian cuisine can be seen in \"mie goreng\" that appeared simultaneously with the introduction of the stir frying technique that required the use of a Chinese wok. In China, the stir frying technique became increasingly popular during Ming dynasty (1368–1644 CE). The introduction of stir frying technique, Chinese wok, and also soy sauce probably took place around or after this period, circa 17th century. The common soy sauce has its origin in 2nd century CE China, however, \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce) was developed in Indonesia with a generous addition of local palm sugar. Sweet soy sauce plus the addition of shrimp paste are the elements that distinguish Indonesian \"nasi goreng\" from Chinese fried rice.\n\nOther than Chinese influence, there is another theory suggested that \"nasi goreng\" was actually inspired by a Middle Eastern dish called \"pilaf\", which is rice cooked in seasoned broth. This suggestion is quite plausible in regard to a particular variant—the Betawi \"nasi goreng kambing\" (Jakartan goat fried rice), which uses mutton or goat meat (traditionally favoured by Arab Indonesians), rich spices and \"minyak samin\" (ghee), which demonstrates Middle Eastern-Indian influence.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" was considered as part of the Indies culture during the colonial period. The mention of \"nasi goreng\" appear in colonial literature of Dutch East Indies, such as in the \"Student Hidjo\" by Marco Kartodikoromo, a serial story published in Sinar Hindia newspaper in 1918.\nIt was mentioned in a 1925 Dutch cookbook \"Groot Nieuw Volledig Oost Indisch Kookboek\". Trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies during that time has increased the popularity of nasi goreng to the world.\n\nAfter the independence of Indonesia, \"nasi goreng\" was popularly considered as a national dish, albeit unofficial. It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theater Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Howard Palfrey Jones, the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of Sukarno's reign in mid 1960s, in his memoir \"Indonesia: The Possible Dream\", said that he like \"nasi goreng\". He described his fondness for \"nasi goreng\" cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praise it as the most delicious \"nasi goreng\" he ever tasted.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is ubiquitous in Indonesia, and also popular in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore, as well as the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia. Today microwave-heated frozen \"nasi goreng\" is available in convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Lawson in Indonesia.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavour, owed to generous amount of caramelized \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce) and ground powdered \"terasi\" (shrimp paste), and the flavour is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice. \"Nasi goreng\" often includes \"krupuk\" and \"bawang goreng\" (fried shallots) or (fried onions) to give a crispier texture.\n\nThe main ingredients of \"nasi goreng\" include pre-cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, powdered \"terasi\" (shrimp paste), salt, garlic, shallot, chilli pepper, spring onions, nutmeg, turmeric, vegetable oil, onions, palm sugar, ginger garlic paste, and slices of cucumber and tomato for garnishing. Some recipes may add black pepper, fish sauce, or powdered broth as a seasoning and taste enhancer. Eggs might be mixed into fried rice or fried separately, either as \"telur ceplok\"/\"telur mata sapi\" (sunny side up eggs), or \"telur dadar\" (omelette), and also \"telur rebus\" (boiled eggs). Originally optional, the addition of fried egg is often named as \"nasi goreng spesial (pakai telur)\" or special fried rice topped with fried egg.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" often add condiments as add-on upon the fried rice. Fried shallot and traditional crackers are often sprinkled upon to give crispy texture, pickles are added to give sour freshness in otherwise rather oily dish, a cooked egg is often placed on top of the dish to add savouriness, while chili paste is to add the zesty spiciness according to one's preference. Some common condiments are:\n\nThere is no single recipe of \"nasi goreng\", as every fried rice dish with certain mixtures, additions, ingredients, and toppings could lead to another recipe of \"nasi goreng\". Usually, in Indonesian households, the ingredients of \"nasi goreng\" prepared for daily breakfast are the leftovers of the previous day's meals preserved in the refrigerator, with fresh vegetables and eggs added. The basic ingredients of \"nasi goreng\" are rice and sliced or ground \"bumbu\" (spices) mixture of shallot, garlic, pepper, salt, tomato ketchup, sambal or chili sauce, and usually sweet soy sauce. Some variants may add \"saus tiram\" (oyster sauce), \"ang-ciu\" (Chinese cooking red wine), \"kecap ikan\" (fish sauce), or \"kecap inggris\" (like Worcestershire sauce). The texture of leftover cooked rice is considered more suitable for \"nasi goreng\" than that of newly cooked rice, as freshly cooked rice is too moist and soft.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is known as fried rice variants commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Despite myriad specific regional variants, it is notable that certain recipe appears in multiple countries, \"kampung\" (village), shrimp paste, \"sambal\", salted fish and egg-wrapped fried rices are appears in both Indonesia and Malaysia. There are similar fried rice dishes from neighboring countries, such as \"khao phat\" from Thailand, and \"sinangag\" from the Philippines.\n\nIn most parts of Indonesia, \"nasi goreng\" is cooked with ample amounts of \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce) that created golden brownish color and the flavour is mildly sweet. However, in other places such as Eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi and Maluku), the sweet soy sauce are usually absent and replaced by bottled tomato and chili sauce, creating reddish-colored \"nasi goreng\". This variant is called \"nasi goreng merah\" (red fried rice) or \"nasi goreng Makassar\" after the South Sulawesi capital. Some variants of \"nasi goreng\", such as salted fish or \"teri Medan\" (Medan's anchovy) \"nasi goreng\", are not using \"kecap manis\" at all, creating lighter color similar to Chinese fried rice or Japanese \"chahan\".\n\n\"Nasi goreng Kambing Kebon Sirih\" is one of a popular variant of goat meat fried rice sold in Kebon Sirih area, Central Jakarta. While \"nasi goreng amplop\" is fried rice \"enveloped\" inside thin omelette skin, almost identical to Malaysian \"nasi goreng pattaya\".\n\nThe most common \"nasi goreng\" usually uses chicken and egg, however, some variants are usually named after its additional ingredients. Examples of \"nasi goreng\" specific variants includes:\n\nIndonesians also called foreign versions of fried rice simply as \"nasi goreng\", thus \"nasi goreng Hongkong\" and \"nasi goreng Tionghoa/China\" refer to Chinese fried rice, while \"nasi goreng Jepang\" refer to \"yakimeshi\" or \"chahan\".\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is a commonly popular household dish in Malaysia. It is also can be found in restaurants and food courts in the country.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" variants popular in Malaysia includes:\n\nIn Singapore, \"nasi goreng\" is one of the most popular rice dish and is a staple with a lot of variations of it. Some include sausage, stinky beans (for vegetarians), seafood, and beef—chicken however, is the most common meat. Nevertheless, since Singapore is a cosmopolitan city with significant numbers of foreign nationals and expatriate, plus English is a commonly spoken language in the island, the term \"nasi goreng\" is seldom used in the city, thus its English translation \"fried rice\" is commonly used.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" variants commonly popular in Singapore includes:\n\nSingapore has an ethnic Chinese majority that has influenced local cuisine. Chinese fried rice recipes, such as Yeung Chow fried rice also popular throughout in Singapore.\n\nNasi goreng is common rice dish in Brunei. Nasi goreng ikan masin or \"fried rice with salted fish\" is the most popular version.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" variants commonly popular in Brunei includes:\n\nNasi goreng () is a common dish in Sri Lanka. It was adopted into Sri Lankan cuisine through cultural influences from the Sri Lankan Malays and Indonesia. It is prepared using a variety of ingredients including spices, soy sauce, oyster sauce, ginger, white onion, shrimp, cucumber and prawns.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Indonesian cuisine is common due to the historical colonial ties with Indonesia. Indonesian migrants (or their offspring) cater Indonesian food both in restaurants and as take-away. Also, take-away versions of \"nasi goreng\" are plentiful in \"toko\" Asian grocery shop and supermarkets. Supermarkets also commonly carry several brands of spice mix for \"nasi goreng\", along with \"krupuk\" and other Indonesian cooking supplies. Chinese take-aways and restaurants have also adapted \"nasi goreng\", plus a selection of other Indonesian dishes, but spice them Cantonese style. In Flanders, the name \"nasi goreng\" is often used for any Asian style of fried rice. Distinctive version of \"nasi goreng\" has been developed, such as Javanese-Suriname version of the dish. In the Netherlands, \"nasi goreng\" has been developed into snack called \"nasischijf\" (Dutch for \"nasi disk\"), it is a Dutch deep-fried fast food, consisting of \"nasi goreng\" inside a crust of breadcrumbs.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" can be eaten at any time of day, and many Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans eat \"nasi goreng\" for breakfast. In most of households, last night leftovers stored in refrigerator are often used to create \"nasi goreng\" for breakfast; such as chunks of chicken, shrimp, vegetables, fish, beef, \"bakso\" or sausages. The rice used to make \"nasi goreng\" is cooked ahead of time and left to cool down (so it is not soggy), which is one reason to use rice cooked from the day before.\n\nWhile most Indonesian households serve it for breakfast, \"nasi goreng\" is also a popular choice for late night supper served by street vendors, in \"warungs\" and also by travelling night hawkers that frequent Indonesian residential neighborhoods with their wheeled carts. The \"nasi goreng\" is usually cooked on order for each serving, since the cook usually asks the client their preference on the degree of spiciness: mild, medium, hot or extra hot. The spiciness corresponds to the amount of \"sambal\" or chili pepper paste used. The cook might also ask how the client would like their egg done: mixed into nasi goreng or fried separately as \"telur mata sapi\" or \"ceplok\" (fried whole egg) or as \"telur dadar\" (omelette). The term \"spesial pakai telur\" means the \"nasi goreng\" has two eggs per serving, one mixed into the \"nasi goreng\" as scrambled egg, another fried separately. As well as offering \"nasi goreng\", the travelling \"nasi goreng\" cart vendors usually also serve \"mi goreng, mi rebus\", and \"kwetiau goreng\". \"Nasi goreng\" usually made by order, nevertheless, some popular \"nasi goreng\" \"warung\" or food stall might cook them in bulk, due to large demand. The degree of spiciness is applied by customer through the addition of \"sambal\" hot sauces.\n\n\"Nasi goreng\" is a popular dish in Indonesian restaurants and Asian fusion restaurants. It is often served for breakfast in Indonesian hotels. In Indonesian restaurants, the dish is often served as a main meal accompanied by additional items such as a fried egg, \"ayam goreng\" (fried chicken), satay, vegetables, seafoods such as fried shrimp or fish, and \"kerupuk\" (meaning crackers, also called \"prawn crackers\" and many other names). Although traditionally \"nasi goreng\" is seldom consumed with satay nor fried chicken, in many Indonesian restaurants abroad this combo is quite popular—in order to allow clients to sample quintessential Indonesian dish; nasi goreng and satay in single serving.\n\nIn many \"warungs\" (street stalls), when accompanied by a fried egg, it is sometimes called \"nasi goreng istimewa\" (special fried rice). \"Nasi goreng\" is usually sold together with \"bakmi goreng\" (fried noodles) and \"mie rebus\" (noodle soup). They sell a simple \"nasi goreng\" with small amount of shredded fried chicken, scrambled egg, green vegetables, and served with pickled cucumber. In Indonesia there are restaurant chains that specialize on serving \"nasi goreng\".\n\nSome seasoning brands sold in supermarkets, such as Sajiku-Ajinomoto, Racik, LaRasa, Royco and Kokita offering \"\"bumbu nasi goreng\"\", an instant \"nasi goreng\" seasoning paste to be applied upon frying leftover rice. Today the modern convenience stores such as 7-Eleven and Lawson operated in Indonesia also offering prepackage frozen microwave-heated \"nasi goreng\" take away.\n\n\n"}

Other herbs, such as marjoram, chives and parsley, are also often added and, in Germany, bockwurst is often smoked as well.\n\nBockwurst was originally said to have been eaten with bock beer. In Bavaria and Berlin it was sold during the bock beer season. Nowadays you can buy bockwurst all year round almost everywhere in Germany in butcher's shops, cheaper restaurants, snack bars, food booths, some bakeries and gas stations.\n\nAs a natural casing sausage it is usually cooked by simmering or steaming although it may also be grilled. Boiling is avoided as the casing may split open and the bockwurst may look unappetizing and loses flavor to the cooking water.\n\nA usual portion consists of one bockwurst with mustard and a bread roll or potato salad on a plate. Sometimes, however, the bockwurst is served directly in the bread roll and covered with mustard. In some regions of Germany is served with bockwurst.\n\nBockwursts made in America, also from veal and pork, bear more resemblance to the Bavarian Weisswurst in color and taste, albeit parsley is rarely used in this version.\n\nThe \"Bockwurst\" was first mentioned in Bavaria in 1827. Nevertheless, an \"urban legend\" in Berlin claims that it was invented in 1889 by restaurant owner R. Scholtz of Berlin.\n\n"}

A variant type of fusilli are formed as hollow tubes of pasta that are twisted into springs or corkscrews and are called fusilli bucati. Another variant are twisted long lengths as though spaghetti were coiled around an object known as fusilli lunghi. Fusilli Napoletani are flat lengths of coiled pasta formed around a spindle.\n\n"}

{"id": "3292004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3292004", "title": "Royal icing", "text": "Royal icing\n\nRoyal icing is a hard white icing, made from softly beaten egg whites, icing sugar (powdered sugar), and sometimes lemon or lime juice. It is used to decorate Christmas cakes, wedding cakes, gingerbread houses, cookies and many other cakes and biscuits. It is used either as a smooth covering or in sharp peaks. Glycerine is often added to prevent the icing from setting too hard. When placing icing on cakes, Marzipan is usually used under the royal icing in order to prevent discoloration of the icing.\n\nUsual proportions are 2 egg whites to 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of glycerine, and around 1 pound of sugar depending on the application.\n\nAs well as coating cakes and biscuits, royal icing is used to make decorations such as flowers and figures for putting on the cake. The royal icing is piped into shapes which are allowed to harden on a non-stick surface. These can then be arranged to create edible decorative effects on a variety of sweet foods. The Glycerine must be omitted for this purpose. Royal Icing is often used to create snow scenes but is also used as an edible adhesive – particularly for gingerbread houses.\n\nRoyal icing is traditionally prepared with raw egg whites, which have a very small chance of transmitting salmonella poisoning. Meringue powder or ready-to-use, pasteurized, refrigerated egg whites (wet eggs) can be used with similar results.\n\nIncreasing concern about nut allergies has led to the substitution of fondant icing for royal icing in some cake decorating, because royal icing often is used with marzipan, which is made of almonds.\n\nThe OED gives the first mention of royal icing as Borella's Court and Country Confectioner (1770). The term was well-established by the early 19th century, although William Jarrin (1827) still felt the need to explain that the term was used by confectioners (so presumably it was not yet in common use among mere cooks or amateurs). It developed at some stage in the early 18th century, replacing earlier styles of icing which generally involved making a meringue-like concoction which was then dried out in the mouth of an oven. Elizabeth Raffald (1769) is generally credited with the addition of a layer of marzipan between it and the cake beneath. Piping with royal icing came along a little later, in the 1840s, driven by German culinary innovators. Prior to that, decoration was usually of moulded pastillage or sugarpaste.\n\nThere is a myth that it was named royal after it gained widespread publicity when images of Victoria and Albert's bride cake (wedding cake) were circulated, but this is untrue, not least because the real boost came when images of their eldest daughter's wedding cake were published in papers such as the Illustrated London News (not founded until 1842), by which time the name had been in use for over 80 years.\n\n"}

The earliest recipe found so far is from \"The Australian Women's Weekly\" in December 1937.\n\nThe principal ingredient is the commercial breakfast cereal Rice Bubbles. The binding ingredient is hydrogenated coconut oil (such as the brand Copha), which is solid at room temperature. Since making chocolate crackles does not require baking it is often used as an activity for young children.\n\nThe recipe is relatively easy requiring only vegetable shortening, icing sugar, cocoa, desiccated coconut and Rice Bubbles (or Coco Pops). The hydrogenated oil is melted and combined with the dry ingredients and portions of the mixture are placed in cupcake pans to set, usually in the refrigerator. Sometimes these are lined with cupcake papers – round sheets of thin, rounded and fluted paper. The hydrogenated oil re-sets to give each cake its form without baking.\n\nVariations include adding raisins, chocolate chips, mini-marshmallows, or peanut butter. Alternatives to Rice Bubbles include Corn Flakes and crispy fried noodles. Melted chocolate or non-hydrogenated coconut oil can be substituted for hydrogenated coconut oil.\n\n\n"}

The soup is simply separated from the noodles and other ingredients, and served on the side.\n\nThe term \"lo mein\" comes from the Cantonese \"lou1 min6\" (撈麵), meaning \"stirred noodles\". The Cantonese usage of the character 撈, pronounced \"lou1\" and meaning \"to stir\", differs from the character's usual meaning of \"to dredge\" or \"to scoop out of water\" in Mandarin, in which case it would be pronounced as \"laau4\" or \"lou4\" in Cantonese (\"lāo\" in Mandarin).

Puttu means \"portioned\" in Malayalam. It is made of steamed cylinders of ground rice layered with coconut. It is highly popular in the Indian state of Kerala as well as in many areas of Sri Lanka, where it is also known as \"pittu\". Puttu is served with side dishes such as palm sugar or chickpea curry or banana. In Bhatkal Puttu is served with side dishes such as ghee and sugar or Paya.\n\nPuttu principally consists of coarsely ground rice, grated coconut, little salt and water. It is often spiced with cumin, but may have other spices. The Sri Lankan variant is usually made with wheat flour or red rice-flour without cumin whereas the Bhatkal recipes have plain coconut or masala variant made with mutton or shrimp flavoured grated cocunut.\n\nPuttu is made by slowly adding water to ground rice until the correct texture is achieved. It is then spiced, formed and steamed with layers of grated coconut.\n\nPuttu is generally cooked in a metal \"puttu kutti\" vessel with two sections. The lower section holds water and the upper section holds the puttu — where the rice mixture is inserted with layers of grated coconut. Perforated lids separate the sections to allow the steam to pass between them.\n\nA number of alternative cooking vessels are used, such as traditional vessels where a perforated coconut shell is attached to a section of bamboo, or a \"chiratta puttu\" made of a coconut shell or of metal shaped similarly to a coconut shell.\nOther types of cooking vessels include a pan similar to an idli pan with small holes in the bottom, pressure cookers and, mainly in the Malay Archipelago, hollow bamboo stalks.\n\nPuttu is often served along with gravies, like fish curry, chicken curry or \"kadala\" (chickpea) curry, and papadum. Also plantain, jackfruit, mango or banana is commonly served with it. In southern kerala people eat puttu accompanied by sweet black coffee. In Tamil Nadu it is served with grated coconut with jaggery made of palm or sugar cane, or with sweetened coconut milk. In Sri Lanka, pittu is usually accompanied with tripe curry, fish or a meat curry, coconut milk and a sambol.\n\nSome variations of puttu use other grains such as wheat flour, tapioca and corn flour. The layered filling of coconut can be replaced by other foods, such as egg curry or banana. Puttu prepared in a ball shape are called \"manipputtu\". Puttu can also be made using bamboo rice\n\nPuttu is also very common in Mauritius. It is usually sold by hawkers and is served as a snack. It is often misspelled \"poutou\" and should be spelled \"putu\" in Mauritian creole. The ingredients are the same; rice flour, sugar and desiccated coconut but cooked in metal cylinders.\n\nIn Maritime Southeast Asia, there are numerous similar dessert dishes known as \"kue putu\" in Indonesian, \"putu bambu\" in Malay, and \"puto bumbóng\" in Tagalog. They vary by preparation and ingredients but are also steamed in bamboo tubes and are served with sugar and grated coconut.\n\nIn Indonesia, \"kue putu\" is characteristically green due to the use of pandan flavoring. It is commonly found being sold by traveling vendor carts together with \"klepon\", which is actually ball-shaped \"kue putu\".\n\nIn the Philippines, \"puto bumbong\" is deep purpe in color due to the use of a unique rice variety called \"pirurutong\". They are culturally significant as a common traditional Christmas dessert. \"Puto\" in the Philippines is also a general term for traditional steamed rice cakes.\n\nIn 2006, students of the Oriental school of Hotel Management in Wayanad in north Kerala made a 10 foot long puttu. They cooked the giant puttu in a specially designed 12 foot long aluminium mould, using 20 coconuts and 26 kg of powdered rice. It took about one and a half hours to cook.\n\n"}

The origin of Appam is disputed and potential sources of origin might be Sri Lanka or the southern tip of India. It is a common food in Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala where it is eaten most frequently for breakfast or dinner.\n\nVir Sanghvi, an Indian journalist, quotes food historian K. T. Achaya and states that the appam is mentioned in the Tamil \"Perumpanuru\". K. T. Achaya in the last published book of his lifetime states that Appam was well established in ancient Tamil country.\n\nIt is called \"appam\" (അപ്പം) in Malayalam, \"appa\" (ආප්ප) in Sinhala, \"aappam\" (ஆப்பம்) in Tamil, \"chitau pitha\" (ଚିତାଉ) in Oriya, \"paddu\" or \"gulle eriyappa\" in Kodava, and \"arpone\" in Burmese. Appam is commonly referred to by its anglicized name, \"hoppers\", in Sri Lanka. In Indonesia it is known as \"kue apem\".\n\nPlain Appam or Vella Appam are bowl-shaped thin pancakes made from fermented rice flour. They derive their shape from the small \"appachatti\" in which they are cooked. They are fairly neutral in taste and mostly served with some spicy condiment or curry. These hoppers are made from a batter using rice, yeast, salt and a little sugar. After the mixture has stood for a couple of hours, it can be fried in the appachatti with a little oil. In south-central Kerala, it is mostly served with kadala curry, mutton or vegetable stew or egg roast.\n\nPalappam is prepared using a spoonful of thick coconut milk/coconut cream added to the doughy centre. When cooked, the centre is firm to the touch but remains soft inside and is sweeter as a result of the coconut milk.\n\nIt is a form of appam where kallu is added to the fresh batter to kick start the fermentation. It might also denote appam cooked on a griddle (\"kal\") instead of \"appachatti\".\n\nThey are same as plain hoppers, but an egg is broken into the pancake as it cooks\n\nHoney hoppers are crispy pancakes cooked with a generous amount of palm treacle. Some people also like to add some jaggery just before serving to make it extra sweet.\n\nIdiyappam (string hopper or noolputtu) is made from rice noodles curled into flat spirals. It is served for breakfast with a thin fish or chicken curry, containing only one or two pieces of meat, a dhal (lentil) dish, and a spicy sambol or fresh chutney. String hoppers are made from steamed rice flour made into a dough with water and a little salt, and forced through a mould similar to those used for pasta to make the strings. They are cooked by steaming. Some people even sprinkle grated coconut on the rice noodles. These hoppers can be bought ready-made. The Indian and Sri Lankan population eats string hoppers for breakfast or dinner. There are many variations to this, depending on the type of flour used etc. This simple dish can be adapted into other foods such as string hopper Biriyani, by adding scrambled eggs or vegetables. Another example is located in Kerala, 'Idiyappam' Paaya (goat leg soup made using coconut).\n\nAchappam is a deep fried rose cookie made with rice. It is a signature Syrian Christian food as per K. T. Achaya.\n\nKuzhalappam is a typical Syrian Christian dish which is a fried crisp curled up like a tube.\n\nNeyyappam owes its origins to Kerala and is a signature food of Syrian Christians of Kerala, as per K. T. Achaya. It is made with rice flour, jaggery, clarified butter ghee.\n\nUnni appam is a variation in which mashed plantain is added to the batter. The batter is made out of rice flour, jaggery and plantain is poured into a vessel called \"appakarai\" or \"appakaram\", which has ghee heated to a high temperature. The appams take the shape of small cups and are fried until deep brown. Both neyyappam and unni appam are eaten as snacks.\n\nPesaha appam is made by Nasrani Christians in Kerala during Pesaha (Passover). This type of appam is dipped in syrup or Pesaha Pal (Passover Coconut Milk) before being served.\n\nVattayappam is made from rice flour, sugar, and coconut. It is an oil free tea time snack in majority of households in Kerala. The dish is made by steam-cooking the batter, and is very similar to the bánh bò from Vietnam.\n\nKandarappam, is a sweet dish made using rice and all 4 dals and jaggery. The dish has all the ingredients that is considered to bring good luck in Hindu tradition. Using all 4 dals is considered auspicious during festivals.\n\nIn Indonesia, a variant of appam is known as \"kue apem\" or \"kue apam\". It is an Indonesian \"kue\" or traditional cake of steamed dough made of rice flour, coconut milk, yeast and palm sugar, usually served with grated coconut. Indonesian households or community traditionally communally made kue apem for celebration and festivities. For example, Keraton Yogyakarta traditionally held \"Ngapem\" ceremony, where royal household communally cook \"kue apem\" (Javanese version of \"appam\") as a part of \"Tingalan Jumenengan Dalem\" ceremony. It is quite similar to \"kue mangkok\". Just like \"kue putu\" it is derived from Indian influence on Indonesian cuisine.\n\n\n"}

Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cumin, bay leaves, nutmeg and mace (spices that are not frequently used in Thai curries) are combined with local produce such as dried chili peppers, cilantro seeds, lemongrass, galangal, white pepper, shrimp paste, shallots and garlic to make the \"massaman\" curry paste.\n\n\"Massaman\" or \"matsaman\" is not a native Thai word. It is generally thought to refer to the Muslims, with earlier writers from the mid-19th century calling the dish \"Mussulman curry\"; \"Mussulman\" being an archaic form of the word \"Muslim\".\n\nAccording to Thai food expert David Thompson, as well as Thai journalist and scholar Santi Sawetwimon, the dish originated in 17th century Central Thailand at the cosmopolitan court of Ayutthaya, through the Persian merchant Sheik Ahmad Qomi from whom the Thai noble family of Bunnag descends. Other theories contend that \"massaman\" is a southern Thai dish, influenced by Malay and Indian cuisine, or that its name is derived from the Malay word \"masam\", which means \"sour\".\n\nThe curry is extolled in a poem from the end of the 18th century, attributed to Prince Itsarasunthon of Siam, the later King Rama II (1767-1824). It is dedicated to a lady who is believed to be Princess Bunrot, the later Queen Sri Suriyendra, wife of King Rama II. The second stanza of the poem reads:\n\nThe first-ever recorded recipe for Massaman curry was \"Chicken Massaman curry with bitter orange juice\" spelled \"Matsaman\" (หมัดสมั่น) and written by Lady Plean Passakornrawong in 1889.\n\nDue to its Muslim roots and therefore Islamic dietary laws, this curry is most commonly made with chicken, but there are also variations on this dish using duck, beef, mutton, goat, or, less commonly so, pork. As pork is \"haram\" (forbidden) in Islam, this last variant is not eaten by observant Thai Muslims. Vegetarians and vegans have created their own versions of this dish.\nThe flavors of the massaman curry paste (\"nam phrik kaeng matsaman\") come from spices that are not frequently used in other Thai curries.

Traditionally the practice of eating Easter bread or sweetened \"communion\" bread traces its origin back to Byzantium and the Orthodox Christian church. The recipe for sweetened or \"honey-leavened\" bread may date back as far as the Homeric Greek period based on anecdotal evidence from classical texts that mention this type of special food. It is also widely known that sweetened bread desserts similar to panettone were a Roman favorite.\n\nA \"cozonac\" is traditional Easter bread in Bulgaria, \"kulich\" is one of different traditional Russian \"Paska\" Easter breads. \"Kolach\" is a traditional Czech bread made at Christmas in the shape of a ring. Usually, three rings are stack on top of each other to represent the Holy Trinity. Ukrainian Easter breads are also called \"￼￼Paska￼￼,￼￼￼￼\" where often a rich, white bread is served and decorated on the top with symbols, including crosses, flowers, braids, wheat, or other designs representing aspects of Orthodox and Eastern Catholic faith. \"Babka\" is also a Ukrainian, Polish and Belarusian bread also made at Easter. Rather than being broad and round, like \"Paska\", \"babka\" typically is tall and cylindrical, often baked in bundt-type pan. It frequently contains raisins, succade, or orangeat, and may be iced on top. It is much sweeter than \"Paska\". \"Babka\" usually is only made, like \"Paska\", to celebrate Easter Sunday and the rising of Christ.\n\nRomania and Moldova also have a traditional Easter bread called \"Pasca\" (The term \"Pasca\" is \"Easter\" in the Eastern Orthodox faith, similar to \"Pâques\" in French. It is derived from the Hebrew \"pesah\".). The Romanian \"Pasca\" bread is made with cheese (and may also include fruits, nuts, or chocolate for decoration). It is usually found alongside another traditional sweet bread which Romanians make for Easter and Christmas called \"cozonac\".\n\nDuring the weeks before Easter, special Easter bread is sold (in German: \"Osterbrot\", ). This is made with yeast dough, raisins, and almond splinters. Usually, it is cut in slices and spread with butter. People enjoy it either for breakfast or for tea time (in German: \"Kaffee und Kuchen\", literally ″coffee and cake″).\n\nThe Dutch Easter bread is the so-called 'stol', a fruit bread with raisins and usually filled with almond paste. It is the same type of bread also eaten as a Christmas bread.\n\nIn Sardinia, Italy, bread is a part of a wide social context. It is the most important food in Sardinia, as well as all over Italy and the Mediterranean. \"Bread is a nexus of economic, political, aesthetic, social, symbolic, and health concerns\". Bread is symbolic for life. A peasant proverb mentions, \"Chie hat pane mai non morit — one who has bread never dies\". The Easter holiday is one where bread brings itself into the symbolic realm. Bread is significant for religious purposes. Luisa Fois described bread in her life after she was married and for the Easter holiday. The bread was made into a cross to represent the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Since they were married, they needed to eat it together. They would share their lives now, and they must share their \"cross\" together (their life's burden) as well. \"Bread was a product of their union, and its shared consumption reaffirmed their interdependence\". From this we gather that bread also displays a message, rather than being an item purely for consumption and nutritional purposes. Two kinds of Easter bread are described in Counihans article. One contained two points, and an egg covered with a cross. \"The egg and the points that recall birds in flight speak of fertility, sexuality, and procreation — basic themes in Easter and its pagan precursors\". The second bread was designed to have no overall shape, but was rather baked to encircle an egg, with the initials \"BP\" put on it. The initials \"BP\" stand for \"buona Pasqua\" or \"happy Easter\". \"Letters rather than forms express meaning. Letters are symbolic of civilization and ... meaning\".\n\n\n"}

It was launched in 1995, and was originally brewed in Golden, Colorado. \n\nOriginally called Bellyslide Belgian White, the beer was created by Keith Villa, a brewer at the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field, Denver, Colorado (owned by the Molson Coors Brewing Company). Blue Moon brewed at the Molson Brewery in Montreal, Quebec, Canada is sold in the US, as well as exported to Europe. Blue Moon Brewing Co. is an entity of Tenth and Blake Beer Company, the craft and import division of MillerCoors.\n\nThe grain bill for Blue Moon includes malted barley, white wheat, orange peel, coriander and oats—and is usually served with a slice of orange, which its brewmasters claim accentuates the flavor of the brew.\n\nAvailable in cans, bottles and kegs, Blue Moon has 5.4% alcohol by volume. In Minnesota and Utah, the alcohol content of all Blue Moon beers bought in grocery or convenience stores is 3.2% alcohol by weight (approximately 4.0% alcohol by volume). Blue Moon Brews and seasonal brews sold in liquor stores are 5.4% by volume.\n\n\nIn 2012 Blue Moon has come under fire from the Brewers Association for not stating on the bottle that the beer is made by MillerCoors. The Brewers Association says that this omission allows the Blue Moon Brewing Company to masquerade as an independent craft brewer. Independent craft brewers, such as Greg Koch, CEO of Stone Brewing Co., agree that the multinational conglomerate brewers' use of bottle imagery similar to independent craft beers misleads consumers. In May 2015, a California man filed suit against MillerCoors for the \"Craft Beer\" labeling.\n\nIn 1999, the Confédération des Brasseries de Belgique (The Confederation of Belgian Breweries) sued the then-named Coors Brewing Company over its use of the term \"Belgian White\". The CBB alleged Coors' advertising was misleading, and could confuse American consumers into believing Blue Moon was made in Belgium. Coors at first responded by adding \"Made in USA\" and \"Belgian-style\" in small print to the bottle labels, but refused to change its advertising or packaging.\n\nCoors eventually settled out of court with the CBB, agreeing to change the labeling to \"Belgian-style Wheat Ale\". Additionally, the CBB distributes the beer to conglomerates in European countries.\n\nThe New Belgium Brewery, which makes Fat Tire Amber Ale, also complied with the CBB's request for name changes.\n\nIn addition to their original Belgian White variety, Blue Moon Brewing Company offers Blue Moon Summer Ale, renamed Honey Moon in 2006. Honey Moon contains 5.2% alcohol by volume in a standard 12 fluid ounce bottle. The beer was renamed \"Summer Honey Wheat\" in 2011, and is still sold under that name. \n\nIn autumn, Blue Moon provides Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale, renamed Harvest Moon in 2007. This variety contains the flavors of pumpkins and other autumnal spices. Harvest Moon is typically available in bottles from mid-September through December. It contains 5.7% alcohol by volume in a standard 12 fluid ounce bottle. The beer was renamed \"Harvest Pumpkin Ale\" and is still marketed under that name. \n\nBlue Moon offers Blue Moon Winter Abbey Ale during the winter season. Its name was changed to Full Moon with the subtitle \"Blue Moon Winter Ale\" in 2007. It is brewed with natural flavor and a caramel color. Full Moon contains 5.6% alcohol in a standard 12 fluid ounce bottle. The name was changed to \"Mountain Abbey Ale\" in 2012. \n\nIn spring, Blue Moon provides Blue Moon Spring Blonde Ale, originally known as Rising Moon. In 2011 the recipe was changed removing the Kaffir lime leaves. The new recipe focuses more on orange and lemon peel to add the citrus flavors. In 2013 the beer was changed to \"Valencia Grove Amber\", an amber ale brewed with Valencia orange peel, roasted malts and a touch of wheat.\n\nIt addition to its seasonal brews, Blue Moon released a pale ale called Pale Moon in 2008, with filings commenced to create a Pale Moon Light. Pale Moon is now marketed as \"Rounder\".\n\nBlue Moon released a revamped and renamed set of seasonal beers starting with the Winter Abbey Ale, in 2010.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a traditional Brazilian recipe, from the state of Minas Gerais. Though its origins are uncertain, it is speculated that the recipe has existed since the eighteenth century, although it became popular around the 1950s.\n\nPão de queijo originated from African slaves like many other Brazilian foods. Slaves would soak and peel the cassava root and make bread rolls from it. At this time, there was no cheese in the rolls. At the end of the 19th century, more ingredients became available to the Afro-Brazilian community such as milk and cheese. They added milk and cheese to the tapioca roll making what we now know as Pão de queijo. It is also widely eaten in northern Argentina and is inexpensive and often sold from streetside stands by vendors carrying a heat-preserving container. In Brazil, it is also very commonly found in groceries, supermarkets and bakeries, industrialized or freshly made.\n\nDespite being referred to as \"bread\", the Cheese Bread is basically a type of starch tart cookie or sweet plus eggs, salt, vegetable oil, and cheese, with soft and elastic consistency and with a few variations.\n\nWith the discovery of mines near Ouro Preto around 1700, 1/5 of the Brazilian population, mainly slaves, occupied a vast territory, moving from the Northeast and shifting the economic hub of the colony towards the Southeast.\n\nThe mining cycle caused a huge impact and stimulus to the production of staple foods and this is when cheese bread was created. The Northeast and the nearest regions obtained beans, rice, corn and its cornmeal, pork and lard, milk and cheese. More distant areas such as the gaucho pampa, began to offer kind of beef meat. It is said that the cheese bread was offered by slave women to the farmers.\nAt the time, wheat flour, the raw material of classical baking, was hard to find. Typical of temperate regions, the ancient cereal never combined with the warmth of the Brazilian Northeast, and was then imported from Europe to Brazil to serve the King's noblemen.\n\nCreatively, Minas Gerais cooks replaced the non-existent wheat with starch derived from cassava tuber with tupiniquins origins. Added the mass cured cheese chips, hardened and grated, and taken to the oven, turned out to like being called \"bread\".\n\nThere are several different recipes where the ingredients and the type of cheese vary widely - as well as the final result. Some of them use sweet starch, other sour, or even both. But what gives it its main feature is that it is based on starch cassava and some kind of cheese.\n\nThe fat - lard, vegetable oil, butter or margarine - acts as a molecular lubrificant,\n\nThe egg gives colour and flavour to the recipe.\n\nThe type of cheese varies according to preference or availability. The most used are mozzarella, parmesan, and the more traditional ripened cheese and standard cheese, both also from Minas Gerais. The cheese gives the typical flavor of the cheese bread, hence its name.\n\nThere is also the boiled cheese bread with a preparation technique that requires boiling water while preparing, sometimes mixed with vegetable oil in flour. The boiled cheese bread has the closest taste of natural, as in the boiling process the dough is pre-cooked.\n\nSome recipes use potato.\n\nPães de queijo are formed into small balls, around 3-5 centimeters in diameter (though they may be larger) and about 50 calories in each roll. The cassava flour is a powerful starch which is key to the texture of the pão de queijo; unlike other types of bread, pão de queijo is not leavened. Small pockets of air within the dough expand during baking and are contained by the elasticity of the starch paste. The tapioca starch used in pão de queijo makes this snack gluten free. Varieties of stuffed pães de queijo with catupiry, hot and melted goiabada, doce de leite and other variations can be found in Brazil.\n\nIn Brazil, \"pão de queijo\" is a popular breakfast dish and snack. It continues to be widely sold at snack bars and bakeries and it can also be bought frozen to bake at home. In Brazil, cheese puff mix packages are easily found in most supermarkets.\n\nGiven its growing popularity in the US, the frozen packages of \"pao de queijo\" can now be found in some American grocery stores such as Costco, County Market, HEB, Publix, World Market and Whole Foods.\n\nPão de queijo arrived in Japan with the dekasegi. It is usually made with rice flour instead of the cassava (tapioca) starch.\n\n"}

It is usually eaten lukewarm with different jams, typically cloudberry, cherries or strawberry though lingonberry is often used, as well as fruits, whipped cream or, more rarely, ice cream. The reason for eating ostkaka while it is lukewarm is that if eaten too warm, the delicate flavors of the ostkaka will not come through, and if eaten too cold the consistency will be too firm and heavy.\n\nDespite the similarity in literal translation, ostkaka should not be confused with cheesecake which is a layered cake. Swedes typically call the latter by its English name, sometimes making it \"American Cheesecake\", to avoid confusion. Though even then, Scandinavian restaurant menus sometimes confuse the two.\n\nOstkaka is traditionally produced by adding rennet to milk and letting the casein coagulate. Cream, sugar, eggs, almonds and bitter almonds are added to create a batter.\n\nIt is then baked in an oven and served warm - never hot, as this will nullify some of its flavor.\n\nTraditionally, the Småland variety is cooked in a large copper pot. This gives rise to a tradition of allowing guests to take their portions from the centre of the Ostkaka, thereby avoiding any traces of copper that may have leached into the mixture where it is in contact with the pot.\n\nSince the process of curdling milk is somewhat complicated, alternative recipes intended for home cooking instead use cottage cheese as a base to simulate the texture of the dessert.\n\nSince 2004, the \"Day of Ostkaka\" is celebrated on November 14 in Sweden. It was established and is promoted by the \"Ostkakans vänner\" (\"Friends of Ostkaka\"), a non-profit organization founded in the spring of 2003.\n\nSimilar curd cake recipes are also found in America and Russia, often under the name \"Angel Tears\" curd cake.\n\n"}

The name is also used for a baked cheese and vegetable dumpling, prepared in some regions of Italy and on the French island of Corsica.\n\nThere are several legends to explain the name, primarily based on the anticlerical sentiment of the region.\n\nOne is that gluttonous priests were so enthralled by the savory pasta that they ate too quickly and choked themselves. Another explanation involves the \"azdora\" (\"housewife\" in the Romagna dialect), who \"chokes\" the dough strips to make the strozzapreti. The azdora would express rage (perhaps triggered by the misery and difficulties of her life) and curse the local clergy, resulting in a pasta that could choke a priest. A third states that wives would customarily make the pasta for churchmen as partial payment for land rents (In Romagna, the Catholic Church had extensive land properties rented to farmers), and their husbands would be angered enough by the venal priests eating their wives' food to wish the priests would choke as they stuffed their mouths with it. The name surely reflects the diffuse anticlericalism of the people of Romagna and Tuscany.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that following Sunday mass, it was common for the priest to visit homes of the villagers and enjoy dinner with them. The more pleasant experiences for the priest would entice them to come back to that particular home more frequently. As a means for the family to let the priest know that he might be overextending his welcome, they would serve this pasta which had later earned the name \"Strozzapreti.\" Another origin story is that the pasta resembles a clerical collar, commonly referred to as a \"Priest Choker\".\n\nThe dough (see some regional variations below) is rolled out in thick flat sheets. It is then cut into strips. The strips are lightly rolled or twisted between the palms. The large pasta is separated into 10 cm pieces by pinching. Unlike spaghetti or macaroni, this pasta is not uniform in size or shape.\n\nThe dough traditionally used for strozzapreti in Romagna is made with wheat flour, water, salt, and (optionally) eggs.\n\nIn Emilia the dough is made from flour, water, Parmesan cheese, and egg whites, all beaten together.\n\nPici is a somewhat similar form of pasta from Tuscany in which hand-rolled, solid fat tubes of dough are cut but left untwisted; the taut, rope-like appearance provides yet another popular explanation for the association with strangling.\n\nStrozzapreti () refers also to large gnocchi made of cheese and vegetables, and then baked, typical of Corsica. Seasoned spinach or chard is rolled into balls together with brocciu cheese, and then baked in the oven. These balls are large enough to choke a person if eaten whole.\n"}

They share their condolences and memories while singing hymns and eating food together. \n\nIn the old days, the nights were calm and reserved for the most part - but that tradition has changed with the times. Today, these gatherings resemble parties much more than they resemble wakes (though this is not true for all “nine-nights”).\n\nNine-Nights are no longer a time to mourn, but a time to celebrate since the loved one is no longer suffering in life. When friends come they do not come with just condolences, instead they come with food, drink and music; this is after all a celebration. True to its name this celebration last nine nights and days with the ninth and final night being the night before the church service (Though some modern Islanders only celebrate for seven days and seven nights). On the ninth night the family prepares the food for all who come. \n\nAs tradition has is on the ninth night it is believed that the spirit of the deceased passes through the party gathering food and saying goodbye before continuing on to its resting place. Out of all the nights this night is the most revered since it is the end of the celebration. Stories about the deceased and the fondest memories are shared, along with prayers. Games, such as dominoes, are played and there is the singing of hymns, which is also done on the other nights as well.\n\nOn the ninth night a table is set up under a tent with food for the loved one, though no one is allowed to eat from it before midnight, which is believed to be the time when the spirit passes through. Along with the food are drinks, most often Jamaican rum with no less than 100 proof. The types of food on the table can vary from one celebration to the next, but typically fried fish and bammy are the main foods on the table. This time is very important to the family because it gives them the opportunity to celebrate the life of their loved one and to be able to say their goodbyes.\n\nIn order for the deceased to move on there is a process that must happen. First, there is the \"seeing\". This is when someone looks at a doorway and sees the spirit. They then tell someone and that person tells someone and so on. The leader of the ceremony greets the duppy (spirit) and then the night song begins. This is a song played for the duppy while he or she is told stories by the elders. Traditionally on the ninth night of the deceased's death their bed and mattress are turned up against the wall, in order to encourage the spirit (Jamaican patois \"duppy\") to leave the house and enter the grave. Then the leader of the ceremony uses a piece of white chalk to draw a cross over the exit that the spirit used to leave, allowing the spirit to never return.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago many Christians participate in a \"wake\" in the days leading up to the funeral service which resembles the 'nine nights' traditions of other islands. In this country, Christians celebrate the \"nine-nights\" service nine days after the death of the deceased which may coincide with a few days after the funeral service and burial.\n\n"}

It is an important part of the Scanian culinary heritage. The name means \"cake on a spit\", and this describes the method of preparation: it is the Swedish variation on the spit cake.\n\nA mixture consisting mainly of eggs, potato starch flour and sugar is rolled slowly onto a skewer which is being rotated over an open fire or other heat source. The dessert thus produced is very dry. It is then wrapped in a subsequently sealed plastic bag to preserve its dryness. To stay crisp, the cake should only be unwrapped at the actual moment it is to be eaten. Spettekaka can range in size anywhere from a few inches to several feet in height and over a foot in diameter. The very large cakes are served by sawing cuboids from the cake, leaving as much standing as possible.\n\nSpettekaka is frequently served accompanied by dark coffee, vanilla ice cream and port wine. A hacksaw blade is used to gently saw the dessert into serving sized pieces, as it will crumble or shatter if a knife is used or too much pressure is applied with the saw blade.\n\nThe world's largest spettekaka was baked in Sjöbo, Scania, in 1985, and is mentioned in the 1986 \"Guinness Book of Records\". It was 3,6 m high and baked in one piece.\n\n\"Skånsk spettkaka\" has PGI status under EU law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3338431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3338431", "title": "Méhariste", "text": "Méhariste\n\nMéhariste is a French word that roughly translates to camel cavalry. The word is most commonly used as a designation of military units.\n\nFrance created a corps of méhariste camel companies (\"Compagnies Méharistes Sahariennes\") as part of the \"Armée d'Afrique\" in the Sahara in 1902, replacing regular units of Algerian spahis and tirailleurs earlier used to patrol the desert boundaries. The newly raised \"Compagnies méharistes\" were originally recruited mainly from the Chaamba nomadic tribe and commanded by officers of the French \"Affaires Indigènes\" (Native Affairs Bureau). Each company of Méharistes comprised six officers, 36 French non-commissioned officers and troopers, and 300 Chaamba troopers. Their bases were at Tabelbala, Adrar, Ouargla, Fort Polignac and Tamanrasset.\n\nWith their local tribal links plus mobility and flexible tactics, the \"Compagnies Méharistes\" provided an effective means of policing the desert. A similar camel corps was subsequently raised to cover the southern Sahara, operating from French West Africa and falling within the \"Armée Coloniale\". From the 1930s the Méharistes formed part of the \"Compagnies Sahariennes\" which also included motorised French and (from 1940) Foreign Legion units. Following the establishment of a French mandate over Syria in 1920, three méhariste companies were organised in that country as part of the French Army of the Levant.\nDuring World War II méhariste companies organised as \"nomad groups\" saw service against Axis forces in the Fezzan and southern Tunisia. At the end of the war the \"Compagnies Sahariennes\" resumed their role as desert police. Operating in wide-ranging platoons of 50 to 60 men under French officers, they administered local laws, provided some basic medical assistance, inspected wells and reported on the state of pastures in the fertile oasis areas. \n\nThe Sahara remained relatively quiet during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62) but there was one instance, on 17 October 1957, where 60 méharistes of the Adrar camel company near Timimoun mutinied and killed their eight French officers and N.C.Os. According to differing reports the mutineers either were able to join the rebel ALN or were caught in the open desert by French fighter aircraft and destroyed. During the later stages of the Algerian War, méhariste detachments did patrol the southern (Saharan) ends of the fortified Morice Line along the Tunisian border. On several occasions the ALN attempted to outflank the line by disguising commando units as méharistes. \nThe camel-mounted units were retained in service until the end of French rule in 1962. The locally recruited méharistes were then disbanded while French personnel were transferred to other units.\n\nThe modern Algerian army maintains up to twelve companies of desert troops in the Sahara but these are mechanized units. In 1996 the government of Mali re-established a camel corps of six companies for patrol and policing work along its Saharan border. However the Tuareg rising of 2012 and subsequent disturbances led to widespread losses and desertions amongst the méharistes. As of 2013 only 368 méharistes remained in service and the future of the corps was in doubt. Mauritania retains a méhariste unit for at least ceremonial purposes.\n\nThe \"Compagnies Méharistes\" wore flowing coats (\"gandourah\") of either white for Arab or blue for Tuareg troopers, with turbans, veils and wide black trousers (\"seroual\"). Two red sashes were worn – one wound around the waist and the other crossed on the chest under red-brown leather equipment of traditional Saharean pattern. A khaki field dress of similar cut was also worn.\n\nFrench personnel wore light-blue kepis. All ranks were normally bare-footed when in the saddle, in order not to harm the sensitive upper body of their camels. The saddlery and other leather equipment was of local design and often elaborately decorated.\n\nLocally recruited camel corps were maintained by the Italian army in their respective North African territory, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, during the colonial period. The Italian Zaptie meharista served primarily as desert gendarmerie. Like their French counterparts they were recruited from the indigenous desert tribes, and wore modified versions of tribal dress.\n\nLocally recruited camel corps were maintained by the Spanish army in their North African territory, the Spanish Sahara. Spanish Tropas Nomadas served primarily as desert gendarmerie. Like their French counterparts they were recruited from the indigenous desert tribes, and wore modified versions of tribal dress.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3340845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3340845", "title": "Dashanami Sampradaya", "text": "Dashanami Sampradaya\n\nDashanami Sanyasi (IAST \"\" \"Tradition of Ten Names\") is a Hindu monastic tradition of \"single-staff renunciation\" (\"ēka daṇḍi sannyāsi\") generally associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition. The disciples of Adi Shankaracharya are also called \"Dash Nam Sanyasi\" as the Title is further divided into ten groups viz. Giri, Puri, Bharati, Ban, Aranya, Sagar, Aashram, Saraswati, Tirtha, and Parwat. Dashnam Sanyasins are associated mainly with the four Maths in four corners of India, established by Adi Shankaracharya. Initially all the disciples were Sanyasins who embraced sanyas either after marriage or without getting married.\n\nSingle-staff renunciates are distinct in their practices from Shaiva \"trishuldhari\" or \"trident-wielding renunciates\" and Vaishnava traditions of \"Tridandi\" sannyāsis.\n\nIn the 8th century a section of the (Ēkadaṇḍisannyāsins) were organized by Adi Shankara into four maṭhas. However, the association of the Dasanāmis with the Shankara maṭhas remained nominal. Any Hindu, irrespective of class, caste, age or gender can seek sannyāsa as an Ēkadaṇḍi renunciate in the Dasanāmi tradition.\n\nĒkadandis were already known during what is sometimes referred to as \"Golden Age of Hinduism\" (ca. 320-650 CE)\n\nThe \"Golden Age of Hinduism\" (ca. 320-650 CE) flourished during the Gupta Empire (320 to 550 CE) until the fall of the Harsha (606 to 647 CE). During this period, power was centralized, along with a growth of long distance trade, standardization of legal procedures, and a general spread of literacy. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but orthodox Shrauta Hinduism was rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta dynasty. The position of the Brahmans was reinforced and the first Hindu temples emerged during the late Gupta age. The Mahābhārata, which probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (c. 4th century), already mentions \"ēkadaṇḍi\" and \"tridaṇḍi\".\n\nThe Ēkadaṇḍis existed in the Tamil country during the south-Indian Pandyan dynasty (3rd century BCE - 16th century CE) and the South-Indian Pallava dynasty (2nd - 9th centuries CE). Being wandering monastics, they were not settled in the brahmadeyas or settlement areas for Brahmins. There existed tax free bhiksha-bogams for feeding the Ēkadaṇḍi ascetics in the ancient Tamil country.\n\nĒkadaṇḍis and Tridandis were also active in Eastern India, and appear to have existed there during the North-Indian Gupta Empire (320 to 550 CE ).\n\nAccording to R. Tirumalai, \"There appears to have been no sectarian segregation of the Shaiva (Ēkadaṇḍi) and Srivaishnava (Tridandi Sannyāsins)\".\n\nAt the beginning of what is referred to as \"Late classical Hinduism\", which lasted from 650 till 1100 CE, Shankara established the Dasanami Sampradaya.\n\nAfter the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralized in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with \"countless vassal states\": in the east the Pala Empire (770-1125 CE), in the west and north the Gurjara-Pratihara (7th-10th century), in the southwest the Rashtrakuta dynasty (752-973), in the Dekkhan the Chalukya dynasty (7th-8th century), and in the south the Pallava dynasty (7th-9th century) and the Chola dynasty (9th century).\n\nThe kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. \"The great king was remote, was exalted and deified\", as reflected in the Tantric Mandala, which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.\n\nThe disintegration of central power also lead to regionalization of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of \"Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism\" was diminished. Rural and devotional movements arose, along with Shaivism, Vaisnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, though \"sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development\". Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords. Buddhism lost its position, and began to disappear in India.\n\nShankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva, established the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ēkadaṇḍi monastics under an umbrella grouping of ten names. Several other Hindu monastic and Ēkadaṇḍi traditions remained outside the organization of the Dasanāmis.\n\nAdi Shankara organized the Hindu monastics of these ten sects or names under four maṭhas or monasteries, with headquarters at Dvārakā in the west, Jagannatha Puri in the east, Sringeri in the south and Badrikashrama in the north. Each maṭha was headed by one of his four main disciples, who each continued the Vedanta Sampradaya.\n\nMonastics of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the Dasanāmis associated with the Shankara maṭhas follow the procedures enumerated by Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Shankara maṭhas.\n\nThe association of the Dasanāmis with the Smartha tradition or Advaita Vedānta is not all-embracing. One example is the Kriyā Yoga tradition that considers itself eclectic (see: Eclecticism), with ancient unchangeable beliefs, and outside the ambit of differences in the understanding of Vedanta. Other examples are the Tantric Avadhūta Sampradāyas and Ekadaṇḍi sannyāsa traditions outside the control of the Shankara maṭhas The Dasanāmis or Ēkadaṇḍis also founded, and continue to found or affiliate themselves with, maṭhas, ashrams and temples outside the control of the Shankara maṭhas.\n\nThe Advaita Sampradaya is not a Shaiva sect, despite the historical links with Shaivism:\nNevertheless, contemporary Shankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities. The greatest influence of the gurus of the Advaita tradition has been among followers of the Smartha tradition, who integrate the domestic Vedic ritual with devotional aspects of Hinduism.\n\nAccording to Nakamura, these maṭhas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was \"due to institutional factors\". The maṭhas which he built exist until today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, \"while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time\".\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the four \"Amnaya maṭhas\" founded by Adi Shankara, and their details.\n\nAccording to the tradition in Kerala, after Shankara's \"samadhi\" at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four maṭhas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.\n\nAccording to Pandey, the ēkadaṇḍis or Dasanāmis had established monasteries in India and Nepal in the 13th and 14th century.\n\nIn the 16th century, Madhusudana Saraswati of Bengal organised a section of the Naga (naked) tradition of armed sannyasis in order to protect Hindus from the tyranny of the Mughal rulers. These are also called Gusain, Gussain, Gosain, Gossain, Gosine, Gosavi, Sannyāsi.\n\nWarrior-ascetics could be found in Hinduism from at least the 1500s and as late as the 1700s, although tradition attributes their creation to Sankaracharya\nSome examples of akhara currently are the Shri Panchadashanam Juna Akhara of the Dashanami Naga, Shri Panchayati Mahanirwani Akhara, Shri Taponidhi Niranjani Akhara, Shri Taponidhi Anand Akhara, Shri Panchayati Atal Akhara, Shri Panchadashnam Awahan Akhara, Shri Pancha Agni Akhara and Shri Panchayati Akhara at Allahabad. Each akhara is divided into sub-branches and traditions. An example is the Dattatreya Akhara (Ujjain) of the naked sadhus of Juna Naga establishment.\n\nThe naga sadhus generally remain in the ambit of non-violence presently, though some sections are also known to practice the sport of wrestling. The Dasanāmi sannyāsins practice the Vedic and yogic Yama principles of ahimsā (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), aparigraha (non-covetousness) and brahmacārya (celibacy / moderation). The Dasanāmis are generally believed to be celibate, and grihastas or householder sannyāsis such as Lahiri Mahasaya and Bhupendranath Sanyal (Sanyal Mahāsaya) were a rarity.\n\nThe naga sadhus are prominent at Kumbh mela, where the order in which they enter the water is fixed by tradition. After the juna akhara, the Niranjani and Mahanirvani Akhara proceed to their bath. Ramakrishna Math Sevashram are almost the last in the procession.\n\nIn the Indian religious and philosophical traditions, all knowledge is traced back to the Gods and to the Rishis who primarily envisioned the Vedas.\n\nThe current Acaryas, the heads of the maṭhas, trace their authority back to the four main disciples of Shankara, and each of the heads of these four maṭhas takes the title of Shankaracharya (\"the learned Shankara\") after Adi Shankara.\n\nThe Advaita guru-paramparā (\"Lineage of Gurus in Non-dualism\") begins with the mythological time of the Daiva-paramparā, followed by the vedic seers of the Ṛṣi-paramparā, and the Mānava-paramparā of historical times and personalities:\n\nHindus who enter sannyāsa in the ēkadaṇḍi tradition take up one of the ten names associated with this sampradaya.\n\nThis section enumerates, in standardised manner, members of the Dasanāmī Order with articles in Wikipedia, listing each under his formal title and name, without the use of the honorifics so cherished by fawning devotees and disciples. The word \"swāmī\" here is not an honorific. It is the title of an initiated member of the Dasanāmī Order. Entries are listed in standard form: TITLE (SWĀMĪ) + PERSONAL NAME + SUB-ORDER NAME. A few entries have the additional title (not honorific) of \"Jagadguru Śankarācārya\" which designates either one of the four supreme leaders of the order (somewhat similar to the position of Pope in Catholic Christianity). \"Mahanta\" is an administrative title designating an organizational position or office assigned to certain persons.\n\n\n"}

The reaction product is an allylic amine. The reaction can be carried out in enantiomeric excess of up to 90% with the aid of bifunctional chiral BINOL and phosphinyl BINOL compounds, for example in the reaction of n-(4-chloro-benzylidene)-benzenesulfonamide with methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) in cyclopentyl methyl ether and toluene at -15°C.\n\nIn one study a reaction mechanism for a specific aza-BH reaction is proposed. Given a set of reaction conditions the reaction is found to be first-order in the triphenylphosphine nucleophile, MVK and the tosylimine concentration in the rate determining step in the presence of a Brønsted acid such as phenol or benzoic acid. The presence of an acid facilitates the elimination reaction in the zwitterion by proton transfer which becomes much faster and no longer rate determining. A 6 membered cyclic transition state is proposed for this reaction step. Because this step is also reversible the presence of acid causes a racemisation process simply by mixing chiral aza-BH adduct, phosphine and acid. \n\nAza-BH reactions are known in asymmetric synthesis by making use of chiral ligands. In one study, for the first time, successful use was made of a chiral solvent based on an ionic liquid (IL). \n\nThis solvent is a condensation product of L-(−)-malic acid (available from the chiral pool), boric acid catalyzed by sodium hydroxide. When the sodium counter ion is replaced by a bulky ammonium salt the resulting ionic liquid has a melting point of −32°C.\n\nThis IL serves as the chiral solvent for the aza-BH reaction between \"N-(4-bromobenzylidene)-4-toluenesulfonamide\" and methyl vinyl ketone catalyzed by triphenylphosphine with chemical yield 34–39% and enantiomeric excess 71–84%.\n\n"}

This tradition generally takes place the week before the last regular-season football game, which before A&M's 2012 move to the Southeastern Conference was the Texas (University of Texas at Austin) game. It signifies the last time that the seniors will stand as a part of the 12th Man student corpus.\n\nIn 1922, two freshman members of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, Oluf G. \"Piccolo Red\" Carson (Fort Worth, TX) and J. William \"Sarge\" Dorsey (Harlingen, TX), began playing a funeral march after losing a football game. The two bandsmen, a piccolo player and a bass horn player respectively, began walking away slowly, like an elephant wandering away to die. Other members of the band fell in behind. They continued the march after each football game for the remainder of the season, regardless of the outcome. Following that first walk, the Aggies began a winning streak, including a victory over their archrival, the University of Texas at Austin. At the conclusion of the football season, their marches were discontinued.\n\nIn 1926, the senior class performed the march again to remember their four years at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. Led by the same two “Fish”, the seniors placed their hands on the shoulder of the cadet in front of them, untucked their shirts and put their hats on backwards indicating that they were out of uniform. They wandered around campus remembering the good and the bad times that they had while students at A&M, and those who had fallen over the years. An underclassman, who had never seen the march before, remarked that they looked like a bunch of old elephants looking for a place to die, hence the name of the tradition.\n\nBefore the 1999 collapse of Aggie Bonfire, the parade of students was led by the eight senior Redpots who supervised the Bonfire construction.\n\nThough started by the Corps of Cadets, today all seniors at Texas A&M are welcome to participate. The march of seniors often stretches for a mile (1.6 km) consisting of several thousand seniors. Before the walk, T-shirts and pictures with live elephants will be taken at the Clayton Williams Alumni Center. For the class of 2007, Elephant Walk began at Kyle Field for Yell practice and presentation of the class gift. From here seniors wander to many historic locations on campus including the 12th Man statue, the Quad, the Jack K Williams Administration Building, the H20 fountain and the Lawrence Sullivan Ross Statue. Along the route, the group stops periodically to participate in yells. While marching, they will often sing Aggie songs, such as \"The Spirit of Aggieland\". The walk ends with seniors immersing themselves in Fish Pond. Underclassmen, non seniors, by tradition are not allowed to use the word Elephant as it’s considered a senior word.\n\nIn the 1980s, juniors often attempted to disrupt the seniors' march, armed with water balloons, shaving cream, and baby powder. The 6th and 13th squadrons from the Corps of Cadets often acted as a scout for the rest of the group, disarming any juniors they saw before the main group arrived at that location. The hijinks resulted in injuries at times, with four people suffering fractured bones in the 1986 event.\n\nIn 1992, campus administration officials became upset over the destruction of campus property and increasing injury rates and mandated that Elephant Walk return to its solemn nature. With the encouragement of many former students, including the Class of 1926, which sent a letter asking students to respect the tradition, the school initiated a formal \"Keep it Clean\" campaign. This became known as Junior E-Walk.\n\nJunior E-Walk begins minutes after Elephant Walk begins. To keep the two classes separate, the juniors march in the opposite direction of the seniors. E-Walk now symbolizes the junior class assuming their role as the leaders of the Twelfth Man.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the four Jim Beam small batch bourbon brands targeted for the high-end liquor market. Its siblings in the line are Booker's, Baker's, and Basil Hayden's.\n\nThe primary expression of the brand is bottled at 100 proof (higher than the typical 80 that is the minimum required by U.S. Federal labeling requirements). Knob Creek was formerly aged for nine years, but is now sold with no age statement.\n\nKnob Creek comes in a rectangular bottle with a corked or twist-on cap and wax-sealed top. The bourbon has a dark, golden-brown color.\nAccording to the company, this is due to the relatively long aging process, which allows it to absorb more sugar from the wood than is the case for the other Jim Beam Small Batch brands. The company describes the flavor as \"rich, sweet, woody, full-bodied, almost fruity\", and the aroma as \"toasted nuts, grain, oak\".\n\nIn 2009, Beam ran a campaign to publicize their shortage of Knob Creek bourbon.

It is 80 proof, in contrast with its three sibling brands of higher alcohol concentration (Knob Creek, Booker's, and Baker's). \n\nThe Basil Hayden's bourbon brand was introduced in 1992 and is named in honor of Meredith Basil Hayden Sr. Hayden was a distiller, and he used a larger amount of rye in his mash than in some other bourbons. Later, Hayden's grandson Raymond B. Hayden founded a distillery in Nelson County and named his label \"Old Grand-Dad\", in honor of his grandfather, which bears a rendering of Basil Sr.'s likeness. When Beam Industries introduced their \"small batch\" collection, among the four was \"Basil Hayden's,\" which the company says uses a mash similar to that originally utilized by Hayden in 1792.\n\nThe brand expression was originally labeled as \"Aged 8 Years\", but in 2014, the age statement was replaced by \"Artfully Aged\", indicating that the brand no longer carries an age guarantee.\nBasil Hayden Sr. was a Maryland Catholic who led a group of twenty-five Catholic families from Maryland into what is now Nelson County, Kentucky (near Bardstown) in 1785. There Hayden donated the land for the first Catholic church west of the Alleghenies and the first Catholic church in what is now the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nThe Heydons (original spelling) emigrated to the Virginia Colony in the 1660s, when much of Britain became inhospitable to Catholics. Francis Hayden, Basil Sr.'s great-grandfather and the first Heydon (then switching to Hayden), moved from Virginia to Maryland in 1678, settling in St. Mary's County on St. Clement's Bay, where the family remained until Basil led his band of Catholic families into present-day Nelson County, Kentucky. During the American Revolution, Basil Sr. supplied provisions to the Colonial Army.\n\nHayden's family can be traced back to England (Norfolk) to the period shortly after the Norman Conquest. One ancestor, Simon de Heydon, was knighted by Richard the Lionheart in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade in the 1190s. His son, Thomas de Heydon, was made Justice Itinerant of Norfolk by Henry III. Around 1400, another ancestor, John Heydon, appears to have been associated with \"The Grove\" – a large estate in Watford (Hertfordshire), located about twenty miles northwest of London. Some researchers have speculated that John Heydon was given the estate for his father Sir Richard de Heydon's services in the French Wars, where Sir Richard perished. Others are less sure. But Heydons definitely lived in Watford from the fourteenth through seventeenth centuries.\n\nFood critic Morgan Murphy said \"The rye-heavy whiskey is aged 8 years and carries a buttery flavor and smooth, tannic finish.\"\n"}

The 6–16 lb (3–7 kg) sections are usually cut down to a workable (6–10 lb) size and seasoned heavily before slow braising or deep frying.\n\nThe traditional way to cook carnitas is in a copper pot (or any thick-bottomed pot), which disperses the heat evenly in a process similar to confit. Lard is used to cover the dish in proportion to the amount of meat being cooked. Once the lard has melted, pork and flavorings are added (usually salt, chili, cumin, oregano or Mexican oregano, marjoram, thyme, bay leaf, and crushed garlic cloves). Traditional carnitas are then made by a process of simmering the meat in the lard until tender over a very low heat. Once appropriate tenderness is achieved, the heat is turned up and the outside of the pork begins to crisp. At this stage, the collagen in the meat has broken down sufficiently to allow it to be pulled apart by hand or fork or chopped with a cleaver. The meat can then be used as an ingredient in tamales, tacos, tortas, and burritos.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3378946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3378946", "title": "Pungmul", "text": "Pungmul\n\nPungmul (; ) is a Korean folk music tradition that includes drumming, dancing, and singing. Most performances are outside, with dozens of players all in constant motion. \"Pungmul\" is rooted in the \"dure\" (collective labor) farming culture. It was originally played as part of farm work, on rural holidays, at other village community-building events, and to accompany shamanistic rituals, mask dance dramas, and other types of performance. During the late 1960s and 1970s it expanded in meaning and was actively used in political protest during the pro-democracy movement, although today it is most often seen as a performing art.\n\nOlder scholars often describe this tradition as nongak (), a term meaning \"farmers' music\" whose usage arose during the colonial era (1910–45). The Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea uses this term in designating the folk tradition as an Important Intangible Cultural Property. Opposition from performers and scholars toward its usage grew in the 1980s because colonial authorities attempted to limit the activity to farmers in order to suppress its use and meaning among the colonized. It is also known by many synonymous names throughout the .\n\nDrumming is the central element of pungmul. Each group is led by a \"kkwaenggwari\" (RR- ggwaenggwari) (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing \"janggu\" (hourglass drum), \"buk\" (barrel drum), and \"jing\" (gong). Wind instruments (taepyeongso, also known as \"hojeok\", \"senap\", or \"nalari\") sometimes play along with the drummers.\n\nFollowing the drummers are dancers, who often play the \"sogo\" (a small drum without enough resonance to contribute to the soundscape significantly) and tend to have more elaborate—even acrobatic—choreography, particularly if the sogo-wielding dancers also manipulate the \"sangmo\" ribbon-hats. In some regional pungmul types, \"japsaek\" (actors) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators, blurring the boundary between performers and audience. \"Minyo\" (folksongs) and chants are sometimes included in \"pungmul\", and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along. Most \"minyo\" are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan (rhythmic patterns) that are common to pungmul, sanjo, p'ansori (RR-pansori), and other traditional Korean musical genres.\n\nPungmul performers wear a variety of colorful costumes. A flowery version of the Buddhist \"gokkal\" is the most common head-dress. In an advanced troupe all performers may wear \"sangmo\", which are hats with long ribbon attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns powered by knee bends.\n\n\"Pungmul\" () was first recognized as an Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1966 under the title \"nongak sipicha\" (, \"twelve movements of farmers' music\"). The designation was changed to simply \"nongak\" in the 1980s in order to accommodate regional variations. The Cultural Heritage Administration currently recognizes five regional styles of the tradition, each named for its center of activity, under Important Intangible Cultural Property no. 11: Jinju Samcheonpo \"nongak\", from South Gyeongsang province (designated in 1966); Pyeongtaek \"nongak\", from Gyeonggi province (1985); Iri \"nongak\", from North Jeolla province (1985); Gangneung \"nongak\", from Gangwon province (1985); and Imsil Pilbong \"nongak\" from North Jeolla province (1988). Each style is unique in its approach toward rhythms, costuming, instrumentation, and performance philosophy: Jinju Samcheonpo for \"yeongnam\" (), Pyeongtaek for \"utdari\" (), Iri for \"honam udo\" (), Gangneung for \"yeongdong\" (), and Imsil Pilbong for \"honam jwado\" ().\n\nMost scholarly works on \"pungmul\" focus on the two distinct styles present in the Honam region encompassing the two Jeolla provinces. In this region, the designations \"jwado\" (left) for Imsil Pilbong and \"udo\" (right) for Iri are determined according to geomantic principles. Looking southward from the \"center\" (Seoul, the capital), \"udo\" indicates \"right\", and \"jwado\" indicates \"left\". Comparative studies between the two styles brought about the development of stereotypes among professional groups. \"Honam jwado\" became known for its varying formations and rapid rhythmic patterns, while \"honam udo\" was generally seen as having slow but graceful rhythmic patterns.\n\nDuring the Joseon dynasty, this folk tradition was the primary mode of musical expression for a majority of the population. Many scholars and performers today claim that the term \"nongak\" () was introduced during the Japanese colonization era in order to suppress its broad use and meaning among the Korean population.\n\nTrue public support for \"pungmul\" improved little in the decade following its recognition and financial backing from the government. There was a lack of interest among Koreans who abandoned their traditional customs after moving to the cities. This phenomenon was coupled with the introduction of Western-style concert halls and the growing popularity of Western classical and popular music.\nIn 1977, prominent architect Kim Swoo Geun designed the Konggansarang (), a performance hall for traditional Korean music and dance located in the capital, and invited artists and scholars to organize its events. During the performance center's first recital in February 1978, a group of four men led by Kim Duk-soo and Kim Yong-bae, both descendants of \"namsadang\" troupe members, performed an impromptu arrangement of Pyeongtaek (\"utdari\") \"pungmul\" with each of its four core instruments. Unlike traditional \"pungmul\", this performance was conducted in a seated position facing the audience and demonstrated a variety of rhythms with great flexibility. It was well received by audience members, and a second performance was soon held three months later. Folklorist Sim U-seong, who introduced both men to the Konggansarang club, named the group SamulNori (), meaning \"playing of four objects\". \"Samul nori\" eventually came to denote an entire genre as training institutes and ensembles were established throughout South Korea and Japan. Usage of the term \"nongak\" was retained in order to distinguish traditional \"pungmul\" from this new staged and urbanized form.\n\nIn general, the major 5 instruments are used for play Pungmul.

Eggs are beaten to a consistency similar to that used for an omelette and then steamed. It is sometimes referred to as egg custard on menus. If eaten cold, it has a taste and texture of a gelatin without sugar (unless added).\n\nThe eggs are beaten and water added to create a more tender texture. A good ratio of water to eggs is 1.5:1. Sesame oil, soy sauce, or chicken broth may be used to add additional flavor. \n\nOther solid ingredients (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) may also be added to the mixture. The egg mixture is poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked. The eggs should be steamed until just firm, so that the texture of the eggs is still smooth and silky. A plate is usually placed on top of the bowl containing the egg mixture and left on while the egg is being steamed. Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam.\n\nUsing four eggs, the average cooking time is 10 minutes with water, 7 minutes with chicken broth. However, this is in addition to the time needed for pre-boiling water. \nThis same dish can be cooked in a microwave, or in a pressure cooker. Both methods take less time, although the end product may not be of the same quality.\n\nHomemade versions might include scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients are added to the egg mixture before steaming. It can also be enjoyed with soy sauce. The taste is usually savory (as opposed to a sweet custard).\n\n\n"}

They may be a figure of a person, animal or inanimate object. Paper dolls have been inexpensive children's toys for almost two hundred years. Today, many artists are turning paper dolls into an art form.\n\nPaper dolls have been used for advertising, appeared in magazines and newspapers, and covered a variety of subjects and time periods. Over the years, they have been used to reinforce cultural beliefs regarding the appearance of ideal women. \n\nToday, they have become highly sought-after collectibles, especially as vintage paper dolls become rarer due to the limited lifespan of paper objects. Paper dolls are still being created today.\n\nSome flat plastic figures are similar to paper dolls, like Colorforms figures and Flatsy dolls, but these are mere imitations and not considered true archetypal characteristics of the paper doll art form. Magnetized versions of paper dolls have also been produced over the years. \n\nPaper dolls have regained popularity with young children featuring popular characters and celebrities. Online and virtual paper dolls like KiSS, Stardoll and Doll makers also have a popular following, with users able to drag and drop images of clothes onto images of dolls or actual people.\n\nPaper dolls have been around as long as there has been paper, perhaps hundreds or even thousands of years by some estimates. Faces or other objects were applied to the paper and they were used during religious rituals and ceremonies in the Asian cultures many centuries ago. The Japanese used paper for Origami, artful paper folding, and dating back to 800 AD they folded paper figurines in the shape of Kimono. Balinese people made paper and leather into puppets since before the Common Era. Other cultures around the world have had paper formations or paper art, including in Poland, where they were called Wycinanki. These early types of paper figures differ from typical paper dolls today, as no clothes were made to be used with the dolls.\n\nThe first manufactured paper doll was “Little Fanny”, produced by S&J Fuller, London, in 1810 \nIn Europe, particularly France, the first paper dolls were popular since the mid-18th century. The oldest known paper doll card is hosted by Germanisches Nationalmuseum and was printed around 1650 in Southern Germany, showing two female figures with a bunch of dresses, headgear, hairstyles and accessoires. The paper was jointed and they were called \"pantins\" meaning dancing or jumping jack puppet. They were intended to entertain adults and spread throughout high society. They were drawn or painted like people with fashions for each doll. These were more similar to contemporary Western paper dolls. Rare hand-painted sets of paper figures dating to the late 1780s can be found in some museums today.\n\n\"The History and Adventures of Little Henry,\" by J. Belcher, was the first American toy that included paper dolls. Published in 1812, this book prompted children to act out various scenes with the paper dolls that were included. \nThe biggest American producer of paper dolls, McLoughlin Brothers, was founded in early 1800 and was sold to Milton Bradley in 1920s. Around this time paper dolls became popular in the USA and then grew in popularity in the following decades. The rise of paper doll production in the mid-19th century to mid-20th century was partially due to technological advances that made printing significantly cheaper.\n\nBook publishing companies that followed in the production of paper dolls or cut-outs were Lowe, Whitman, Saalfield and Merrill among others. Movie stars and celebrities became the focus in the early days of paper dolls in the USA. Paper dolls are still produced today and Whitman and Golden Co. still publish paper dolls.\n\nBesides movie stars, women of leisure tend to be the women featured in paper doll form. As more women began to enter the work force in the twentieth-century, paper doll manufacturers began to produce dolls that represented career women. The women's rights movement in mid-20th century was partially responsible for instigating this change. Brides were another common figure often represented in paper doll form.\n\nVintage paper dolls with hand-painted artwork are becoming increasingly rare due to paper aging issues. They have become collectible, and the prices for mint uncut sets can range from $100 to over $500 for a sought after title.\n\nA paper doll convention is held every year in the United States, with hundreds of attendees. The most recent convention was held in Phoenix, Arizona in the summer of 2016.\n\n\n"}

Variations of the dish preside in some southern regions of China.\n\nIn Thailand it was adapted to Mussel omelettes; most Thai people have the misconception that oyster omelettes and mussel omelettes originated from Thai cuisine rather than Chinese. In Bangkok, notable areas for oyster omelettes include Talat Wang Lang near Siriraj Hospital; Wang Lang (Siriraj) Pier in Bangkok Noi where there are two restaurants; Yaowarat neighborhood, where there is one Michelin-Bib Gourmand restaurant with Charoen Krung neighborhood in Bang Rak, among others. In 2017, the World Street Food Congress announced that oyster omelette is one of the three most notable street food among the street foods of Thailand.\n\nThe oyster omelette is a Taiwanese \"night market favorite\", and has constantly been ranked by many foreigners as the top dish from Taiwan. Its generous proportions and affordable price demonstrates the trait of night market cuisines. \n\nThe dish consists of an omelette with a filling primarily composed of small oysters. Starch (typically potato starch) is mixed into the egg batter, giving the resulting egg wrap a thicker consistency. Pork lard is often used to fry the omelette. Depending on regional variations, a savoury sauce may then be poured on top of the omelette for added taste. \n\nSpicy or chili sauce mixed with lime juice is often added to provide an intense kick.

It is traditionally made of tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, Niçoise olives, anchovies, and dressed with olive oil. It has been popular worldwide since the early 20th century, and has been prepared and discussed by many famous chefs. Delia Smith called it \"one of the best combinations of salad ingredients ever invented\" and Gordon Ramsay said that \"it must be the finest summer salad of all.\"\n\nIt can be served either as a composed salad or as a tossed salad. Freshly cooked or canned tuna may be used. For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should and should not be included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.\n\nThe version known in Nice in the late 19th century was a basic combination of tomatoes, anchovies and olive oil, described as \"simple food for poor people\". Over time, other fresh and mostly raw ingredients were added to the salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called \"La Cuisine à Nice\" included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and black olives, but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil, vinegar, mustard and fines herbes.\n\nFormer Nice mayor and cookbook author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook \"Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen\" called for the salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: \"never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise.\" Médecin wrote that the salad should be made \"predominately of tomatoes\" which should be \"salted three times and moistened with olive oil\". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise \"was a product of the sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi.\" Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, commenting, \"As the various ingredients that go into \"salade niçoise\" are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl.\"\n\nAn organization called \"Cercle de la Capelina d’Or\", led for many years by Renée Graglia until her death in 2013, continues to protest against deviation from traditional local recipes. The group, which certifies restaurants in Nice, sticks with Médecin's standards. They reject commonly included ingredients such as green beans and potatoes, as well as innovations such as including sweetcorn, mayonnaise, shallots and lemon.\n\nIn 2016, French Michelin-starred chef Hélène Darroze posted a salade niçoise recipe on Facebook that included cooked potatoes and green beans. According to journalist Mathilde Frénois, the reaction on Facebook was quick and hostile from the \"purists\". Darroze's version was called \"a massacre of the recipe\", a \"sacrilege\", and a violation of the \"ancestral traditions\" of the salad. She was warned that it is \"dangerous to innovate\".\n\nThe question of the proper ingredients appropriate for a salade niçoise has long been the subject of debate and even controversy. Nigella Lawson observed \"Everyone seems to have a very strong opinion as to what should or should not go into a Salade Niçoise\".\n\nFamed chef and cookbook author Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935), born in Villeneuve-Loubet near Nice, added potatoes and green beans to the traditional recipe, an innovation that remains controversial as a \"questionable idea\" a century later.\n\nSalade niçoise has been known in the United States since at least the 1920s, when a cookbook for hotel chefs included two variations. The first was vegetarian, was dressed with mayonnaise, and included lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, stringless beans and pimento-stuffed olives, while the second version was a composed salad, including the same ingredients, plus anchovies.\n\nA 1941 U.S. version by chef Louis Diat of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel included the anchovies, was dressed with vinaigrette, and added capers.\n\nThe highly influential 1961 American cookbook, \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\", included a recipe that incorporated a potato salad, green beans, both tuna and anchovies and a vinaigrette dressing. Co-author Julia Child later demonstrated the recipe on her television show, \"The French Chef\", in 1970.\n\nA recipe was included in Prosper Montagné's \"Larousse Gastronomique\" in 1938. It called for \"equal parts diced potatoes and French beans. Season with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix with anchovy fillets, olives and capers. Garnish with quartered tomatoes.\"\n\nFrench chef Paul Bocuse included a vegetarian version of the salad, garnished with chopped onion and chervil, in the 1977 English translation of his cookbook.\n\nA 1979 variation by Pierre Franey is called \"Salade Niçoise aux Poires d'Avocat\". Franey wrote, \"I am convinced that had avocados been native to Provence they would have been an inevitable ingredient in the celebrated salad of that region, the salad niçoise.\" This version also included mushrooms and both black and green olives.\n\nClaudia Roden is an advocate of innovation, who observed in 1984 that \"There are not one or two or three versions of salade Nicoise — but dozens, depending on what is available.\"\n\nIn 1984, James Beard created a version incorporating rice for an Uncle Ben's advertising campaign.\n\nIn 1991, Jacques Pépin wrote an article that called the inclusion of canned tuna the \"conventional choice\", and recommended sauteed fresh tuna instead as \"more elegant\". Mimi Sheraton disagrees, commenting, \"Salade Nicoise with fresh tuna is a travesty . . . if you like it, you are wrong!\" In 1999, Pépin joined with Julia Child in a TV series, \"Jacques and Julia: Cooking at Home\". Each prepared a salad they called \"Near Nicoise\". Child's version was a composed salad including tuna and anchovies canned in olive oil, and blanched green beans. Pépin's was a tossed salad including sauteed fresh tuna and potatoes. \nMany chefs have developed variations using seafood other than anchovies or tuna. Ina Garten, Jamie Oliver and Rachael Ray have published variations using salmon as the fish component. Bobby Flay has published variations incorporating shrimp and swordfish both of which he describes as \"Nicoise\" in quotation marks. Sara Moulton also has a recipe incorporating shrimp. Instead of a conventional salad dressing, she uses an Italian tuna sauce. A wide variety of seafoods can be used in non-traditional variations, with San Francisco chef Jay Harlow commenting, \"Mackerel, and even milder fish like rockfish, cod or halibut are also delicious served this way, as are good canned sardines.\"\n\nNigella Lawson has published a quick recipe that substitutes croutons for potatoes.\n\nCat Cora has published a variation that presents the salad as a lettuce wrap.\n\nEmeril Lagasse has a recipe that uses a mayonnaise based creamy Parmesan dressing, and incorporates grilled Yellowfin tuna loin along with Picholine olives in addition to the traditional black olives.\n\nGuy Fieri has a recipe that incorporates couscous and mushrooms.\n\nSandra Lee has a version that includes tuna steaks stuffed with olive tapenade.\n\nMark Bittman has a variation that incorporates farro.\n\nMany other chefs and food writers have written recipes for the salad. Among them are Daniel Boulud, Anthony Bourdain, Melissa d'Arabian, Hélène Darroze, Tyler Florence, Simon Hopkinson, Robert Irvine, Gordon Ramsay, Nigel Slater, Delia Smith, Martha Stewart, Michael Symon and Alice Waters.\n\n"}

The mothakes were primarily either offspring of Spartiate fathers and helot mothers or children of impoverished Spartiates.

{"id": "3414103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3414103", "title": "Parkin (cake)", "text": "Parkin (cake)\n\nParkin or perkin is a gingerbread cake traditionally made with oatmeal and black treacle, which originated in northern England. Often associated with Yorkshire, particularly the Leeds area, it is very widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November, but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.\n\nThe origin of the word \"parkin\" is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire weaver Tim Bobbin describes \"tharf cake\" in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad \" 'The song of Arthur O'Bradley' \" that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)\n\nThe tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as \"tharf\" or \"theorf\" meant unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a 'tharf loove'\n\nParkin is virtually unknown south of the Humber. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake – an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or \"treacle\" as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.\n\nIn Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has the hygroscopic property. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.\n\nThough parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes.\n\nParkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably. It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so cooked cakes on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.\n\nIn southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study \"Prodigal Frugality\", identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November). Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing.\n\nThe Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into \"All Hallows\" by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November. During the period of industrialisation many traditional holidays were discontinued but Guy Fawkes Night continued to be celebrated. In the nineteenth century (1862), parkin and treacle toffee with potatoes baked in the fire had become the traditional foods of Guy Fawkes Night, and in Leeds, November 5 became known as Parkin Night.\n\nThe principal ingredients of a Yorkshire parkin are oatmeal, flour, black treacle (similar to molasses), fat (traditionally lard, but modern recipes use butter, margarine or rapeseed oil), and ginger. Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Yorkshire parkin, whilst Lancashire Parkin is baked using golden syrup, treacle and soft brown sugar. \n\nThe flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent. If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a leavening agent, e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar.\n\nOne of the key features of parkin is that it retains its texture well. It is baked to be hard, but after storing in a sealed tin or box for several days, it becomes soft again, the texture that is intended.\n\n\n"}

Athens, for instance, placed its fleet under the command of generals (\"strategoi\") holding the same title as those who commanded its land forces. Such command structures reflected the fact that, especially early in the Classical period, fleets operated in close conjunction with land forces, and indeed, the title of navarch did not begin to appear until the time of the Peloponnesian War, when fleets began to operate more independently. This separate title was originally used in cities that lacked an established naval tradition, Sparta being the most prominent, but entered broader use later, being adopted by the navies of the Hellenistic era states such as Macedon, Syracuse, Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empire, Achaean League, and Rhodes.\n\nAt Sparta and many other city-states, the position was held for one year only (a situation that compelled the Spartans to resort to an elaborate legal fiction when they wished to reinstate Lysander for more than one year in command). Admirals of despotic or monarchic states, however, could serve for years at a time. At Sparta, the position, unlike most high-level offices, was available to men from outside the Spartiate class; Lysander, the most famous occupant of the office, was a beneficiary of this rule.\n\n\"Nauarchus\", a direct transliteration of the Greek term into Latin, was also used by the Roman Navy for its squadron commanders. The Greek-speaking Byzantines sometimes used the term to designate the captains of ships; the terms \"drungarios\" or \"strategos\" were used to designate their admirals.\n\nIn the modern Hellenic Navy, \"návarchos\" is the highest rank, equivalent to full admiral. All but one of the remaining flag ranks are also derivations of this word: \"Antinávarchos\" (αντιναύαρχος, \"deputy-admiral\") is the equivalent to vice admiral and \"yponávarchos\" (υποναύαρχος, \"under-admiral\"), equivalent to rear admiral, while \"archiploíarchos\" is the equivalent of commodore. The same ranks are also used by the Hellenic Coast Guard. The rank of full \"návarchos\" is held in active service only by the Chief of the General Staff of National Defence, when he is a naval officer, and given to the Chiefs of the Hellenic Navy General Staff on retirement. Under the Greek monarchy, the five-star rank of \"archinávarchos\" (αρχιναύαρχος), equivalent to grand admiral or admiral of the fleet, existed, and was held only by the reigning monarch (Kings George II, Paul and Constantine II).\n\n"}

According to Michel Foucault, \"The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation.\nThey also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).\"\n\nMichel Foucault uses the word in the sense of \"note\", but his translators use the word \"notebook\", which is anachronistic (see codex and wax tablet). Concerning Seneca's discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: \"In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of notebooks on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents.\" In an excerpt from an \"Interview with Michel Foucault\" in \"The Foucault Reader\", he says: \"As personal as they were, the hypomnemata must nevertheless not be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual experience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found in later Christian literature. [... T]heir objective is not to bring the arcana conscientiae to light, the confession of which—be it oral or written—has a purifying value.\"\n\n"}

The gravy is often flavored with black pepper.\n\nAmerican English and British English use the word \"biscuit\" to refer to two distinctly different modern foods. Early hard biscuits (North American: cookies) were derived from a twice-baked bread, whereas the North American biscuit is similar to a savoury European scone.\n\nEarly European settlers in the United States brought with them a simpler and easy style of cooking, most often based on meat, ground wheat and gravy. After the first pigs were carried from England to Jamestown, Virginia in 1608, they became popular as a home-grown edible animal.\n\nThe meal emerged as a distinct regional dish after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), when stocks of foodstuffs were in short supply. Breakfast was necessarily the most substantial meal of the day in the South, for a person facing a day of work on the plantations. In addition, the lack of supplies and money meant it had to be cheap.\n\nRestaurant chains specializing in biscuits and gravy are found in North Carolina, which has Biscuitville, and West Virginia, which has Tudor's Biscuit World. Starting in 2015 McDonald's offered an all-day breakfast menu which served their traditional muffins in most of the United States, but limited biscuits mostly to the southeastern United States.\n\nWhile biscuits and gravy generally refers to sausage gravy, it can also refer to egg gravy, made in one of two ways:\n\nTomato gravy is white gravy mixed with crushed or diced tomatoes.\n\nIn New Orleans, some neighborhood restaurants refer to a tomato sauce or Marinara style Italian sauce as Red Gravy.\n\n"}

It consists of masa harina and corn, slowly steamed or boiled in a pot of water.\n\nIn Argentina, humitas are prepared with fresh corn, sautéed onions and some spices, depending on the region or taste. The dough is wrapped in corn husks and boiled. It is also common to add some diced cheese to the dough, typically queso fresco or goat cheese.\n\nIn Argentina, the term \"humita\" also refers to the creamy-corn filling of an empanada (in Spanish, \"empanada de humita\".) \n\nHumitas in Chile are prepared with fresh corn, onion, basil, and butter or lard.

The dough is wrapped in a corn husk, but is steamed rather than baked or boiled. Ecuadorian humitas may also contain cheese. This dish is so traditional in Ecuador that they have developed special pots just for cooking humitas. Ecuadorian humitas can be salty or sweet.\n\nIn the central Andes region, humitas are prepared with fresh corn combined with lard and salt and queso fresco for a savory dish or with fresh corn with lard, sugar, cinnamon and raisins for a sweet dish. Savory humitas may also be prepared with anise.These are typically very rare in other parts of South America.\n\nThese humitas are prepared with corn wrapped in corn husks and can be cooked in boiling water, placed in a pachamanca oven, or steamed. They can be wrapped in several ways.\n\nOne of the earliest references to huminta in Peru was written by the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega in his \"Comentarios Reales del Inca\", which he published in Lisbon in 1609. In talking about huminta he describes his own memories of consumption about the time he lived in Peru between 1539 and 1560. From this it can be deduced that huminta was already prepared in Peru during this time.\n\n"}

A pure implicitly parallel language does not need special directives, operators or functions to enable parallel execution, as opposed to explicit parallelism.\n\nProgramming languages with implicit parallelism include Axum, BMDFM, HPF, Id, LabVIEW, MATLAB M-code, NESL, SaC, SISAL, ZPL, and pH.\n\nIf a particular problem involves performing the same operation on a group of numbers (such as taking the sine or logarithm of each in turn), a language that provides implicit parallelism might allow the programmer to write the instruction thus:\n\nThe compiler or interpreter can calculate the sine of each element independently, spreading the effort across multiple processors if available.\n\nA programmer that writes implicitly parallel code does not need to worry about task division or process communication, focusing instead on the problem that his or her program is intended to solve. Implicit parallelism generally facilitates the design of parallel programs and therefore results in a substantial improvement of programmer productivity.\n\nMany of the constructs necessary to support this also add simplicity or clarity even in the absence of actual parallelism. The example above, of List comprehension in the sin() function, is a useful feature in of itself. By using implicit parallelism, languages effectively have to provide such useful constructs to users simply to support required functionality (a language without a decent for() loop, for example, is one few programmers will use).\n\nLanguages with implicit parallelism reduce the control that the programmer has over the parallel execution of the program, resulting sometimes in less-than-optimal parallel efficiency. The makers of the Oz programming language also note that their early experiments with implicit parallelism showed that implicit parallelism made debugging difficult and object models unnecessarily awkward.\n\nA larger issue is that every program has some parallel and some serial logic. Binary I/O, for example, requires support for such serial operations as Write() and Seek(). If implicit parallelism is desired, this creates a new requirement for constructs and keywords to support code that cannot be threaded or distributed.\n"}

It was introduced in the United States on December 14, 1992, in the United Kingdom a month later and in Japan in March 1993 to initially positive results. Tab Clear was, however, discontinued after only a short time of marketing in 1994. Unlike most other \"clear\" soft drinks, Tab Clear contained caffeine and, according to the company, had the flavor of cola.\n\nAfter PepsiCo's introduction of Crystal Pepsi in mid-1992, Coca-Cola decided to follow suit with its own clear cola, Tab Clear, at the end of the year.\n\nIn late December 1992, Coca-Cola Co. president Doug Ivester told a gathering of New York reporters that Tab Clear was being positioned as part of the \"mainstream of diet soft drinks\" and was \"not a new-age beverage\". He declared:\n\nTab Clear went international only two weeks after its introduction in the United States. The clear cola with \"a mouthful of flavor\" was introduced at a news conference in London on January 18, 1993. The product was made available to the British public from early February that year with a trial price of 23 pence, initially in 330 ml cans and later in 1.5 and 2 litre plastic bottles. The drink was referred to as \"a completely new idea in soft drinks and is unlike any other product available\". This made Coca-Cola the first of the two rival US soft drink global corporations (Coke and Pepsi) to launch a clear cola in Europe.\n\nIn early February that year, The Coca-Cola Company announced plans to introduce Tab Clear into Japan, scheduling a public introduction for mid-March. Japan became the third country to be introduced to Tab Clear.\n\nAfter positive consumer response in its initial 10 markets, it was announced on February 17, 1993 that Tab Clear would be introduced into an additional 20 American markets the coming March, increasing the drink's availability to 35 percent of the American population. In an article from the \"Los Angeles Times\", it was reported that Coca-Cola expected to have Tab Clear available nationwide by the end of the year.\n\nDespite the positive results, an article published in March that year reported \"one oddity about the new Tab Clear: it is only sold in cans. You would think that would eliminate one of the pop's strongest selling points--its clearness.\"\n\nIn July 2004, in an unrelated article, BBC Business News made a mention of how \"colourless versions\" of Coke \"have not been hugely successful\". Some have even referred to Tab Clear's marketing as a \"born to die\" campaign.\n\nIn his 2011 book, \"Killing Giants: 10 Strategies to Topple the Goliath in Your Industry\", Stephen Denny published an interview with former Coca-Cola Chief Marketing Officer Sergio Zyman that stated the formation and subsequent failure of Tab Clear was a deliberate move to destroy Crystal Pepsi, capitalizing on the public's lack of understanding of Pepsi's heavily marketed product. Tab Clear was marketed as a diet drink, which were less popular than traditional colas, and the Tab brand in general was seen as an inferior product to flagships like Coca-Cola or Pepsi. With Tab Clear being placed in such close proximity to Crystal Pepsi, the image of both brands would be damaged in what Zyman called a \"kamikaze\" strategy. \"This is like a cola,\" Zyman explained, \"but it doesn't have any color. It has all this great taste. And we said, 'No, Crystal Pepsi is actually a diet drink.' Even though it wasn't. Because Tab had the attributes of diet, which was its demise. That was its problem. It was perceived to be a medicinal drink. Within three or five months, Tab Clear was dead. And so was Crystal Pepsi.\"\n\n"}

It takes its name from the little village Laguiole and has been protected under the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) since 1961 and by the amended decree in 1986. Laguiole is said to have been invented at a monastery in the mountains of Aubrac in the 19th century. According to historical accounts, the monks passed down the recipe for making this cheese from cattle during the alpages to the local buronniers, the owners of burons, or mountain huts.\n\nfrench-cheese.com describes the flavor as:\n\n\nToday, Laguiole is made in three different \"départements\": Aveyron, Cantal and Lozère by the coopérative \"Jeune Montagne\". It is the only producer currently licensed to produce this cheese. With a 45% fat content, Laguiole has a pressed, uncooked paste made exclusively from raw, unpasteurized French Simmental or Aubrac cow's milk collected between May and October above 800m altitude. 666 tonnes were produced in 1998 (-9.14% since 1996) from 20,000 - 30,000 litres of milk collected from 79 different farms.\n\nThe Tome weighs and is distinguished by a bull sign and its name stamped on the rind, as well as by an aluminum identification plaque. Its production process starts with renneting before the curd is pressed in two consecutive stages. Maturing takes at least six months and may be as long as twelve months. The rind is natural and thick, the straw-colored paste supple and firm, and the texture rich and creamy.\nRecommended wines: Fruity red wines such as the Marcillac, Cahors or Etraygues.\n\nTraditionally, Tome (or Tomme) de Laguiole is one of the principal ingredients in Aligot (mash potatoes with cheese, cream and butter).\n"}

A residency program in med-peds is four years in length, contrasted with three years for internal medicine or pediatrics alone. Upon completion of a med-peds residency, a doctor can practice in the areas of internal medicine, pediatrics or can complete a fellowship program to further specialize in an internal medicine or pediatrics sub-field. \n\nCombined internal medicine-pediatrics residency programs have existed since 1967, with its origins beginning as early as 1949 in the form of a two-year rotating internship. The specialty was initially established to provide broad-based training in primary care, but programs now offer a curriculum that prepares residents for primary care, hospital medicine, or education in the subspecialties.\n\nInternal medicine physicians, or internists, train three additional years after medical school leading to board certification in internal medicine. Pediatricians train three additional years after medical school to board-certify in pediatrics. Med-peds physicians train for four years and can be \"double-boarded\" for both these specialties. Since there is frequent crossover of disease and treatment between children and adults, med-peds training consolidates these two specialties into four years. The performance of med-peds physicians on the two national board exams is equal to their one-specialty (specific internist or pediatrician) counterparts.\n\nThe ACGME sets requirements for residency programs in medicine-pediatrics. They require that the curriculum be specific for the combined program, not merely training in one specialty after the other. Residents should not be assigned to a medicine service or a pediatrics service for more than 6 consecutive months. Training is required to include experience in the emergency department, critical care services, geriatrics, neonatal intensive care, adolescent medicine, research, and at least four subspecialty services each for adults and pediatrics including cardiology and neurology. At least one-third of training must be with inpatients and one-third with outpatients.\n\nMed-peds physicians are heavily trained for primary care. A recent study on post-residency training showed that 61% of med-peds physicians pursue primary care as a career, 18% enter subspecialties, and 17% pursue hospital medicine. Many subspecialties are available to the med-peds physician, with the current most popular being Infectious Disease, Critical Care, Allergy/Immunology, and Endocrinology.\n\nMed-peds and family medicine are similar in patient populations. Physicians of both specialties can care for all patients from newborn to geriatric patients. Med-peds physicians tend to score higher on licensing exams; the average new med-peds resident scored 236 on step 1 while the average family medicine resident scored 221 in 2016 (the average new resident in all specialties combined scored 233). Family medicine residents train for three years, while med-peds residents train for four. Med-peds physicians are given more training in order to become more proficient at treating and diagnosing more complex diseases, including more emphasis on critical care medicine. Med-peds physicians also receive equal training in adults and pediatrics while family medicine physicians spend a larger percentage of their training working with mostly adults; most family medicine residencies typically spend just 9 months dedicated to pediatrics. Med-peds prepares a physician well for private practice, academic medicine, hospitalist programs, and fellowships. A trend also seen is that an increasing percentage of med-peds physicians treat inpatients (patients in the hospital) as opposed to an outpatient clinic setting. \n\n\n"}

It is also referred to as an \"icebox cake\". Bread, sponge cake or biscuits/cookies are used to line a mold, which is then filled with a fruit puree or custard. It can also be made using layers of breadcrumbs.\n\nClassically, stale bread dipped in butter was used as the lining, but sponge cake or ladyfingers may be used today. The filling may be covered with a thin layer of similarly flavoured gelatin.\n\nDue to the simple preparation of charlottes, many different varieties have developed. Most charlottes are served cool, so they are more common in warmer seasons. Fruit charlottes usually combine a fruit purée or preserve with a custard filling or whipped cream. Some flavors include strawberry, raspberry, apple, pear, and banana.\n\nOther types do not include fruits, but use a custard or Bavarian cream. Chocolate charlotte uses a mousse filling within the layers. A citrus curd is a more contemporary choice.\nRussian Charlotte or \"Charlotte russe\" is a dessert invented by the French chef Marie-Antoine Carême (1784–1833), who named it in honor of his former employer George IV's only child, Princess Charlotte, and his current, Russian employer Czar Alexander I (\"russe\" being the French word for \"Russian\"). It is a cold dessert of Bavarian cream set in a mold lined with ladyfingers.\n\nAn alternative to this is a Charlotte Royale, which has the same filling as a Charlotte russe, but replaces the ladyfinger lining with Swiss roll.\n\nCharlotte russe was also a dessert or on-the-go treat sold in candy stores and luncheonettes throughout the five boroughs of New York, popular during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. It consisted of a paper cup filled with yellow cake and whipped cream topped with half a maraschino cherry. The bottom of the cup is pushed up to eat.\n\nThere is a lot of doubt surrounding the origins of the name \"charlotte\". Despite the fact that charlottes are served across Europe, one etymology suggests it is a corruption of the Old English word \"charlyt\" meaning \"a dish of custard\". In another, meat dishes that were known as \"charlets\" were popular in the 15th century. Other historians say that this sweet dish took its name from Queen Charlotte (1744–1818), wife of George III of the United Kingdom. It is possible that the dessert takes its name from Alexander I's sister-in-law, Charlotte of Prussia.\n\n"}
{"id": "3489121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3489121", "title": "Moo shu pork", "text": "Moo shu pork\n\nMoo shu pork (also spelled mù xū ròu, moo shi pork, mu shu or mu xu pork) is a dish of northern Chinese origin, possibly originating from Shandong. It is believed to have first appeared on the menus of Chinese restaurants in the United States in the late 1960s, and is also a staple of American Chinese cuisine. \n\nIn its traditional Chinese version, moo shu pork (木须肉 / mùxūròu) consists of sliced pork tenderloin, cucumber, and scrambled eggs, stir fried in sesame or peanut oil together with bite-sized cuttings wood ear mushrooms (black fungus) and enokitake mushrooms. The dish is seasoned with minced ginger and garlic, scallions, soy sauce, and rice cooking wine (usually \"huangjiu\").\n\nIn the United States, the dish seems to have appeared in Chinese restaurants in New York City and Washington, D.C., in approximately 1966, receiving mention in a \"New York Times\" guide to Washington, D.C., restaurants published in that year. One of the first restaurants in Manhattan to serve the dish was Pearl's, one of the best known New York City Chinese restaurants to serve non-Cantonese food in the 1960s. A 1967 article in \"The New York Times\" states that another of the first restaurateurs to serve the dish in Manhattan was Emily Kwoh, the owner of the Mandarin House, Mandarin East, and Great Shanghai restaurants. The dish was also early on the menu at Joyce Chen's, a pioneering Mandarin-style restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n\nAt the time of its introduction, the dish was prepared in a traditional manner, but, as wood ears and day lily buds were scarce, a modified recipe was developed. In this modified recipe, which gradually came to predominate in North America, green cabbage is usually the predominant ingredient, along with scrambled eggs, carrots, scallions, and bean sprouts, along with lesser amounts of day lily buds and wood ear mushrooms. The new recipe is more like the filling of Chinese Spring pancake. Shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, snow pea pods, bell peppers, onions, and celery are sometimes also used, and dry sherry is often substituted for the \"huangjiu\". The vegetables (except the day lily buds and bean sprouts) are generally sliced into long, thin strips before cooking.\n\nWhile the above are the typical ingredients, there is some variation in the recipe from chef to chef or restaurant to restaurant. In both the Chinese and Americanized versions, monosodium glutamate, salt, sugar, corn starch, and ground white pepper are also often added. In less authentic North American restaurants, the wood ears and day lily buds – ingredients less familiar to most American customers – are often omitted entirely.\n\nAlthough most commonly made with pork, the same basic dish can be prepared by substituting another meat or seafood; generally only a single meat is used. If made with chicken instead of pork, the dish is called moo shu chicken, and the name is similarly altered if prepared with beef, shrimp or tofu. If prepared without any meat, it is called moo shu vegetables. Many Chinese families use chicken but shrimp and beef are less common in home cooking.\n\nLu (卤), meaning gravy, is also made up by the standard ingredients of moo shu pork, including day lily, wood ear, soy sauce, and starch. Lu or dalu (打卤), with gravy, similar to au jus in Western cuisine. Lu, either vegetarian or with eggs or meat, is often used as a soup base for noodles (Dalu noodles). It can be like either a sauce or a soup. Lu is also used in a breakfast setting over soft tofu, often at Chinese halal fast-food places.\n\nMoo shu pork is usually served with rice in China. Moo shu Lu, the gravy variation, is more often served with noodles and soft tofu.\n\nIn America, moo shu pork is served with a small dish of hoisin sauce and several warm, steamed, thin, white tortilla-like wrappers made of flour, called \"moo shu pancakes\" (Chinese: 木须饼, pinyin: mù xū bǐng), báo bǐng (薄饼, literally \"thin pancakes\") or just called \"Mandarin pancakes\"; these are similar to those served with Peking Duck. In the late 20th century, some North American Chinese restaurants began serving Mexican-style flour tortillas, which are thicker and more brittle, in place of the traditional moo shu wrappers.\n\nThe moo shu pork is then wrapped in the moo shu pancakes, which are eaten by hand in the manner of a taco. The diner may wrap his or her own pancakes; in some Chinese restaurants, waiters or waitresses will do so. First, a small amount of hoisin sauce is spread onto the pancake, then some moo shu pork is placed in the center of the pancake. The bottom of the pancake is folded up (to prevent the contents from falling out), then the sides of the pancake are folded or wrapped, in the manner of a soft taco. Unlike the practice in wrapping a burrito, the top is usually not folded over, as the pancake is generally eaten immediately and thus there is no danger of the food falling out of the top, which is the part that is eaten first. Because the dish often contains a great deal of liquid, care must be taken that the pancake does not become soaked through and break during rolling or eating.\n\nThere are two primary histories for how the name of this dish is to be written and explained.\n\nOne story gives the name as 木犀肉 (pinyin: mù xī ròu). The last character 肉 (ròu) means \"meat\" and refers to the pork in the dish. The first part 木犀 (mù xī) is the name for the Sweet Osmanthus: a small ornamental tree that produces bunches of small and fragrant blossoms that may be yellow or white. \n\nScrambled eggs have an appearance that remind people of the mixed yellow and white flowers, so 木犀 (mù xī) is a poetic way of referring to the scrambled eggs used in preparing this dish. Additionally, at Chinese Confucian death anniversary celebrations, the Chinese word for \"egg\" (蛋; pinyin: dàn) is avoided when referring to dishes containing eggs, as many Chinese curses contain this word. Thus, the word \"dàn\" was typically substituted using the euphemism \"Sweet Osmanthus.\" By this reasoning, in this version of the dish's name, the first character, 木 (mù) is short for 木耳 (mù'ěr, meaning \"wood ear fungus\") and 樨 (xī, meaning \"Sweet Osmanthus tree\") is short for 桂花 (guíhuā, meaning \"Sweet Osmanthus flower\").\n\nThe second way of writing the name of this dish that is commonly seen in Chinese restaurants in the United States is 木须肉 (pinyin: mù xū ròu). The second character 须 (xū) means \"whiskers,\" and is often given an additional determinative component in writing (to distinguish the meaning of \"whiskers\" from the other meanings of 須) so that it comes to be written as 鬚. It is possible that 木須肉 (literally \"wood whiskers pork\") might have been used on the menus of the first American Chinese restaurants to serve the dish in place of the correct compound 木樨肉 (\"sweet osmanthus pork\") due to haste or simply because of the limitations of Chinese typewriters. It may also merely have been the result of writing the wrong character with a similar pronunciation.\n\nTwo additional explanations of the name have unclear origins and may be examples of folk etymology: There is a neighborhood with a similar name in Beijing called Muxi Di (木樨地), which is home to the Muxi Di train station (). The dish is also occasionally also called 苜蓿肉 (mùsù ròu) meaning \"alfalfa meat\".\n\n"}

A humorous newspaper article, that also includes Marco Polo inventing cheese fondue when he is lost in the Alps and wants to eat Chinese hotpot, describes the invention of pizza this way: Marco Polo missed scallion pancakes so much that when he was back in Italy, he tried to find chefs willing to make the pancake for him. One day, he managed to meet a chef from Naples at a friend's dinner party and persuaded him to try recreating the dish. After half a day without success, Marco Polo suggested the filling be put on top rather than inside the dough. The change, by chance, created a dish praised by everyone at the party. The chefs returned to Naples and improvised by adding cheese and other ingredients and formed today's pizza.\n\nHistorical evidence in Europe suggests that pizza was not transmitted to Europe by Marco Polo, but existed in the Mediterranean long before his time. The first recorded use of the word \"pizza\" dates from 997 AD (in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta in Southern Italy), more than 250 years before Marco Polo was born.\n\nSimilar dishes in Chinese culture, and in other cultures, exist:\n\n"}

It has been suggested that it was first produced in the Interior Salish territory of British Columbia which was located in the upper basins of the Columbia and Fraser rivers, and included tribes such as the Columbia, Lillooet, Shuswap among others.\n\nThe typical ingredient list for Indian ice cream includes: \nSugar is added as needed; the bitterness or sweetness of the berries can vary greatly between bushes, with bitter berries requiring the addition of more sugar.\n\nA soapberry bush is generally described as a small to medium-sized, deciduous, broad-topped tree to 30' tall (max. 45') with pinnately compound leaves, clusters of flowers and a yellowish translucent fruit. Soapberries are part of the Elaeagnaceae Family. They are typically found scattered throughout the United States (but are rarely abundantly) in a wide range of soils, along stream bottoms, forest margins, and disturbed areas; southwestern U.S., south-central Plains; northern Mexico.\n\nUnrelated plants in the genus \"Sapindus\" produce highly toxic saponins and share the common name soapberry with the edible Canada buffaloberry. Other names for this soapberry include: \n\nOne of the most common sweeteners used with Indian ice cream was salal berries (\"Gaultheria shallon\"). The main reason for this is that it was always available and always delivered a sweet flavour.\n\n\"Rubus parviflorus\", most commonly known as thimbleberry, was extensively harvested by the First Nations peoples for their deliciously sweet taste. They were added to teas or cakes and, of course, Indian ice cream.\n\nFirst Nations peoples, such as the Coast Tsimshian people, regularly use \"Chamerlon angustifolium,\" most commonly known as fireweed, as sweeteners in Indian ice cream. They would also use the outer part of the stem as a whipper for the soapberries.\n\nThe roots of the Fireweed gives off a bitter taste but the petals have a spicy sweet taste. The petals would be the part that is harvested for making sweeteners.\n\nThe Camas bulb is part of the herb \"Cammassia quamash,\" for which First Nations peoples had many different uses. After the bulb is baked or boiled, it can be eaten like a baked sweet potato but with a sweeter taste. This can then be crushed and mixed together with the whipped Sxusem to give it a sweeter taste and a more solid texture.\n\nWhen sugar was introduced by the first European traders, it changed the eating habits of coastal First Nations people as it was a unique taste to them and it later became a treasured ingredient. It was mixed with Indian ice cream but it was said that too much would ruin the flavour.\n\n1) In a metal, ceramic, or glass bowl, combine 1 cup of fresh soapberries and ¼ cup of water.\n\n2) Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until foam forms, gradually adding 3-4 tablespoons of sugar and up to 1 cup if desired.\n\n3) Continue beating until the foam is stiff.\n\nIf fresh soapberries are not available, use 2 tablespoons of canned soapberries for 1 cup of fresh berries.\n\nA similar recipe, instructs the reader to whip the berries until they become a salmon-pink mousse that peaks as the wooden spoon is removed from the mixture.\n\nThe Thompson tribe used timbergrass (\"Calamoagrostis rubescens\") to both dry and whip the berries as well as using the Rocky Mountain Maple bark as beaters. Some tribes have also whipped soapberries with bunches of inner cedar bark, thimbleberry branches or salal branches in birch bark bowls. It takes about 10 minutes to whip them this way, if you are whipping briskly.\n\nThe berries are placed into a great bowl that is absolutely free of oil or fat and are mixed with a sweetener. The mixture of berries is crushed and vigorously beaten in the manner of whipping cream in order to raise the typical foam of the sxusem confection.\n\nSimilar to whipping egg whites, foaming is reduced in the presence of lipid contamination (grease, egg yolk, etc.). Foam depends on the ability of the surfactant (saponins in soapberries, denatured proteins in egg whites) molecules to bind with each other and create a hydrophobic interaction at the interface. When lipids are present, they interfere with this interaction and reduce the viscoelasticity of the foam.\n\nIn 125mL (100g) of Indian ice cream, an average of all common recipes, there are 37g of fat, 7g of protein, 130 mg of calcium, and small traces of iron, vitamin A, thiamin, and riboflavin.\n\n125mL (50g) of soapberries contain only 1g protein, 10 mg calcium and traces of fats. To achieve the above nutritional profile, the Indian ice cream recipe used likely has added ingredients which differ from the traditional recipe which could include milk, eggs, nuts and dried fruit.\n\nThe consistency of the dessert ranges from a thin, frothy liquid to a thick foam, which is determined by the amount of water added to the recipe. First Nations that originate from the Pacific Northwest, Oregon, Upper Tanana, and Flathead regions prefer to use larger amounts of water to attain a frothy drink. Areas like Clallam, Coeur d’Alene, Bella Coola, and Alaska are more familiar with an ice cream-like consistency of their dessert, which comes from using small volumes, or even no water in their recipes.\n\nOne variation of the recipe includes adding snow flavoured with smoked mountain goat fat after whipping the berries to give additional flavor. To prepare this, fresh snow is packed into a porous basket and hung high off the ground. Directly beneath it, fat is placed on the surface of a red-hot rock. As the smoke from the cooking of the fat rises to the basket, the snow is steeped with the fragrance of mountain goat fat. Modern variations may include the addition of fruits, such as bananas or raspberries, after whipping to increase the dessert’s sweetness.\n\nWhen consumed in large quantities, saponins can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and in extreme cases paralysis and death. Toxicity is extremely rare, however, with the LD50 dose lying between 50–100 mg/kg and the typical intake of UK family members at 15 mg per day. The effects of long term exposure can include hypertension, flaccid quadriplegia and hypokalkaemia among others. It is unlikely that Indian ice cream would be consumed in such large quantities as to cause these conditions.\n\nGiven that Indian ice cream is composed primarily of trapped air, a more likely consequence of over-consumption is aerophagia, the abdominal discomfort that comes from swallowing too much air. A technique involving blowing bubbles with the ice cream in your mouth is said to reduce the likelihood of aerophagia (D. Alexcee, personal communication, March 16, 2016).\n\nSoapberry plants exist as either male or female plants, however only the females produce berries. When soapberries are ripe for harvest, they will possess a variety of defining features. The first is color, being shades between that of orange and red and marginally translucent. The second feature that should be observed before harvesting is the size of the soapberry. A ripe soapberry is about 1/4-inch or less in diameter. The third defining characteristic of a ripe soapberry is its texture. If crushed, the ripe berries will produce a soapy foam. Finally, taste can be used as a measure of ripeness. Deemed by its bitter effects on the palate, a soapberry can be considered ready for harvest via taste. Soapberries are harvested in dry areas during the summer months of July, August, and September.\n\nOnce ripe, soapberries are harvested not by handpicking them off the bush, but by use of a branch as a tool for knocking the ripe berries onto a collecting blanket below the bush. This method ensures that only the berries possessing the previously mentioned characteristics are collected for use.\n\nSaponins are the chemical compound which give soapberries their bitter taste and distinctive foaming abilities. As a component in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits of the shrub, it serves as protection against the growth of bacteria and fungus, as well as the foraging by insects and small animals. However, in larger animals like ungulates, and human beings, saponins can enhance nutrient absorption and digestion. \n\nSaponins are composed of polar sugar groups and non-polar groups of either steroids or triterpenes. This allows saponins, like other surfactants, to reduce the interfacial (or surface) tension found at the oil-water or air-water interface. In Indian ice cream, the reduced interfacial tension stabilizes the foam, greatly enhancing the foamability of the aqueous solution.\n\nIn this capacity, it is the saponins found in soapberries that allow the formation of Indian ice cream. Like beating an egg white, agitating the soap berries introduces air into solution. Without a surfactant like the denatured proteins of egg whites or in this case, saponins, the air would quickly escape and the mixture would return to a solution. However, by stabilizing the interface of the dispersed and continuous phases of the foam, the air remains trapped in the agitated berry solution.\n\nWhen compared to Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), a common synthetic detergent, saponins achieved only 37% of SLS foam height but a similar resistance to decay after being formed. This suggests that some properties of saponin foams are comparable to synthetic foams.\n\nSaponin extraction can be executed in many ways. One of the most common soapberry processing method begins by crushing the berries, then soaking them in water, followed by treating the soapberry liquid with an aerated floating process which produces bubbles. Finally, the bubbles may be collected and left to set to form saponin extract. This saponin extract can then be used for many additional purposes.\n\nSoapberries have multiple uses besides that of a key ingredient in the popular Indian ice cream. Such uses include detergent for laundry, shampoo and soap. Soapberries can act as industrial emulsifiers, moistening agents, or foaming agents, and thus can be used as ingredients in multiple products for hygiene purposes. Saponins from natural sources like soapberries are currently approved for beverages in the EU to stabilize some beverage foams.\n\nFurthermore, some pharmacological effects, such as molluscicidal anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anthelmintic, antidermatophytic, antitussives and cytotoxic activities have been demonstrated in the saponins of plants.\n\nTraditionally, soapberries were sun dried and stored in cedar boxes layered with thimbleberry leaves for protection. In the present, they can be frozen in well packed containers or canned in tin through thermal processing. Containers used to store these berries were not used for cooking or any other purposes to ensure grease would not come in contact with them.\n\nFirst wash and drain the berries. Add a small amount of water just to cover, but do not add any sugar. Boil the berries until they break and juice comes out. Then pack immediately into pre-boiled jars, each leaving a half inch head space. If preparing 1 pint of berries, process 10 minutes, and if quarts, use 15 minutes \n\nPut ripe berries in a basket filled with heated rocks. Then set the berries on a layer of timbergrass on a scaffolding to sun dry. Light a small fire beneath the scaffold to drive away insects contaminating sun drying area. Soak in water and whip to prepare the ice cream.\n\n\n"}

Chak circles are based on the British Raj era revenue collection system. To enhance the government revenue during the British Raj, new canals were built to bring the barani (barren) areas under cultivation by introducing the irrigation to the bangar (upland) areas of Punjab region. Block of contiguous land irrigated by the specific Rajwaha were given a unique \"chak\" number each. The migrant farmers were brought in to settle into those newly irrigated areas around the core of new villages [which started out as \"dhanis\"]. Those new villages were called by the same name as their corresponding irrigation circle \"chak\" number. Government left it to those residents to give \"chaks\" a proper village name later. In due time, the term \"\"chak\"\" became synonymous with the term \"\"village\"\".\n\nChaks are found mainly in the bagar tract on the tri-junction of Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab region. Chak, the administrative revenue assessment circle or division, is also called the Chakla, which is not to be confused with the other types of Chaklas.\n\nThe villages are named using a four-part British colonial era nomenclature: \"Chak \"(number) (letters) (village name)\"\". Variations exist but usually names of chak have four parts, \n\nExamples of four-part nomenclature are \"\"Chak 106 JB Khichian\"\" (JB denotes Jhang Branch canal), \"\"Chak 445 GB Thaggan Wali\"\" (GB denotes Gogera Branch canal) and \"\"Chak 354/WB Dunyapur\"\".\n\nExamples of chak names with first three components of the four-part nomenclature are Chak 152 P (P denotes the Panjnad River from which they draw water), Chak 128 NB (NB denotes North Branch canal) and Chak 21 MB.\n\nExamples of chak names with first two components of the four-part nomenclature are Chak No. 22.\n\nExamples of chak names which now retain only the name of village are Chak Bahmanian (named after [[brahman caste), [[Chak Des Raj]] (named after the founder), [[Chak Mai Dass]] (named after the founder), [[Chak Bilgan]], [[Chak Guru]], etc.\n\n\"Chak\" is also a village in [[Danta Ramgarh]] Tehsil of the [[Sikar]] district in [[Rajasthan]], manily populated by [[Pandits]] and [[Purohits]].\n\nChak Bandi (चकबंदी) or Killa Bandi (किल्लाबंदी), in terms of land and revenue, is the process of [[land consolidation]], and [[Permanent Settlement|Revenue Settlement]]. \"Chak bandi\" and \"Settlement\" is done by the \"[[Land grant|Settlement Officer]]\" with the help of [[patwari]]s, [[lambardar]]s and earlier [[zaildar]] (now abolished). Chakbandi, in terms of irrigation, means that each chak is irrigated by a branch water-course, fed by a [[sluice]] channel in the bank of the main canal where the amount of water given to each chak (farm) owner is in proportion to the area of its chak. Block of contiguous land irrigated by the specific Rajwaha, also called irrigation circle, were given a unique chak number each. The Chak (चक) is also referred to as the Chakla (चकला), which is different from the [[Rolling pin#Types of rolling pins|Chakla-belan]] for making roti or the [[brothel|Chakla (brothel)]].\n\n\"Land consolidation\" is a planned rationalisation, readjustment, rearrangement of land parcels and their ownership to improve the rural infrastructure and to implement the developmental and environmental policies (improving [[Sustainability|environmental sustainability]] and [[Sustainable agriculture|agriculture]]).<ref name=\"10.1016/j.landusepol.2009.07.008\"></ref> For the Chakbandi, contour of village is surveyed, to determine the slope category and drainage profile of the village land in cordinal directions. The land is also evaluated based on its price and productivity. The land holdings of each farmer is consolidated in the standardised-sized \"\"khet\"\" (field plots of usually 1 acre each) and then redistributed to the landlords in proportion to their earlier fragmented land holding's price and productivity. Each chak must contain the same relative quantity of good, bad and indifferent soil. In some \"tarafs\" (sides of a tract), almost every alternate field belongs to a different one of the four or five \"mauzas\" (villages) contained in it. In others the \"patti\"s (fragmented portion of land) are apportioned in long strips of land belonging to each of the different mauzas, and then again subdivided on the same principle.\n\"Permanent Settlement\" is the process of confirmation of landlord's property rights in the form of tenure or ownership and fixing a corresponding [[property tax]] to be paid by the landlords to the government, for using the public infrastructure, such as [[canal]] water for [[irrigation]] which results in higher [[crop yield]].\n\nTerms related to chakbandi in the [[measurement of land in Punjab]] are: [[Khadir and Bangar#Related terms|Banjar, Jungle, Abadi, Shamlat, Gair Mumkin]], [[Khadir and Bangar#Bangar areas and subtypes|Barani, Nahri, Chahi, Taal]], [[Bigha]], [[Doab]], [[HALRIS]], [[Khadir and Bangar]], [[Khasra]], [[Patwari]], [[Shajra]], [[Zaildar]], etc.\n\n\"Wara\" (वारा), a vernacular [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]]/[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] word for the [[Hindi]] word \"\"[[wikt:बारी|bari]]\"\" (बारी), simply means the \"\"turn\"\". Warabandi (वाराबंदी) means the rotational system of a weekly roaster for equitable distribution of irrigation water to the individual chak (field) of each farmer from a [[sluice]] outlet. Time allocated to each farmer to draw water from the sluice is proportional to the size of farmer's land holding. To optimise the system, once the \"wara\" of a farmer is over, the \"wara\" of next farmer in the sequence of contiguous land commences. Irrigators know their turn or \"wara\" in advance.\n\nFor the fair distribution of water, warrabandi takes into consideration Bharai and Jharai. Bharai (भराई) is the common pool time taken from the release of water from canal through sluice or upstream farmer and its arrival at the delivery point of the farmer whose \"wara\" has arrived. Jharai (झराई) is the common pool time (time it takes for the water to arrive) applicable to the tail-end (last) farmer on the sluice.\n\n[[Category:Geography of Haryana]]\n[[Category:Geography of Rajasthan]]\n[[Category:Geography of Punjab, India]]\n[[Category:Geography of Punjab, Pakistan]]"}

Its president was H. Adams. In the mid-1920s, through advertisements in \"Popular Mechanics\" magazine and perhaps other means as well, these machines were marketed as a way to start a small business. The machine’s manual has 3 parts:\nThe seven business plans described are:\n\nSome of the suggested locations for selling included candy stores, theatres, chain stores, bowling alleys, cigar stores, railway stations, dance halls, waiting rooms, garages, filling stations, general stores, and soft drink parlors.\n\nOne could also obtain boxes and bags from the company for packaging the doughnuts. The machines are no longer manufactured as the Food Display Machine Corporation has long been out of business. According to the Annual Report of the Federal Trade Commission for 1937 the company was issued a Cease and Desist order for misrepresenting possible or maximum earnings for its potato chip machines.\n\nThe Brown Bobby machine resembled and operated similar to a waffle iron. Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were prepared for baking by coating with paraffin, though users today would most often use cooking spray. The machine had a high (600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel) and a low (300 watt/surfaces connected in series) setting.

This flooded all the fields around the city with about a foot of water. As there were few, if any, high points, the Spanish soldiers camping in the fields were essentially flushed out.\n\nThe anniversary of this event, known as \"Leidens Ontzet\", is still celebrated every October 3 in Leiden and by Dutch expatriates the world over. Traditionally, the celebration includes consumption of a lot of \"hutspot\".\n\n\"Hutspot\" is normally cooked with \"\" in the same vessel. \"Klapstuk\" is a cut of beef from the rib section. It is marbled with fat and responds well to slow cooking in \"hutspot\". If \"klapstuk\" is not available, then smoked bacon is commonly substituted. The carrots used are generally of the type known as \" (winter carrots)\", which give the dish its distinctive flavour ordinary carrots cannot match.\n\nThe first European record of the potato is as late as 1537, by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Castellanos, and it spread quite slowly throughout Europe from thereon. So the original legend likely refers to what the Dutch call a 'sweet potato' or \"pastinaak\" which is a parsnip; this vegetable played a similar role in Dutch cuisine prior to the use of the potato as a staple food.\n\nThe term \"hutspot\" (which can be roughly translated as \"shaken pot\") is similar to the English term \"hotchpot\" and Middle French \"hochepot\", both of which used to identify a type of meat-and-barley stew that became synonymous with a confused jumble of mixture, later referred to as 'hotchpotch' or 'hodge-podge'. In noting the etymological connection, the Oxford English Dictionary records 'hochepot' as a culinary term from 1440, more than a century before the Siege of Leiden. In \"Melibeus\" (\"c\"1386), Chaucer wrote, \"Ȝe haue cast alle here wordes in an hochepoche\", but that early use probably referred to its legal sense in English law (recorded from 1292) as a blending of properties. Later uses certainly referred to its culinary sense.\n\nRelated Dutch mashed potato dishes such as \"stamppot\" include \"boerenkool\" (\"farmers' cabbage\" or kale), \"andijvie\" (endive), \"spruitjes\" (brussels sprouts) and/or \"zuurkool\" (\"sauerkraut\"), generally with some \"rookworst\" (smoked sausage) or smoked bacon. The chunky texture of the dish distinguishes it from other more smoothly pureed potato-based dishes. More a hearty meal than a side dish, \"hutspot\" is very popular during the long Dutch winter. The Swedish dish \"\" – \"root mash\" – is similar, save for the onions which are substituted with swede (\"kålrot\"). Despite the similar name, it is a distinct dish from the Flemish hutsepot, a meat stew with unmashed vegetables.\n"}

A decoration in the shape of a pickle is hidden on a Christmas tree, with the finder receiving either a reward or good fortune for the following year. There are a number of different origin stories attributed to the tradition, including an origination in Germany. This theory has since been discounted, and it is now thought to be an American tradition created in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the tradition, an ornamental pickle is placed on a Christmas tree as one of the Christmas decorations. On Christmas morning, the first child to find the pickle on the tree would receive an extra present from Santa Claus or would be said to have a year of good fortune.\n\nBerrien Springs, Michigan, was known as the Christmas pickle capital of the world. A pickle parade was held from 1992 until about 2003. The village is in the area of Michigan known for cucumber production.\n\nThis tradition is commonly believed by Americans to come from Germany and be referred to as a Weihnachtsgurke, but this is probably apocryphal. In fact, the tradition is completely unknown in Germany. It has been suggested that the origin of the Christmas pickle may have been developed for marketing purposes in the 1890s to coincide with the importation of glass Christmas tree decorations from Germany. Woolworths was the first company to import these types of decorations into the United States in 1890, and glass blown decorative vegetables were imported from France from 1892 onwards. Despite the evidence showing that the tradition did not originate in Germany, the concept of Christmas pickles has since been imported from the United States and they are now on sale in the country traditionally associated with it.\n\nOne suggested origin has been that the tradition came from Camp Sumter during the American Civil War. The Bavarian-born Private John C. Lower had enlisted in the 103rd Pennsylvania Infantry, but was captured in April 1864 and taken to the prison camp. As the story is told, on Christmas Eve he begged a guard for a pickle while starving. The guard provided the pickle, which Lower later credited for saving his life. After returning to his family, he began a tradition of hiding a pickle on their Christmas tree each year.\n\nAnother origin which comes from Berrien Springs is a Victorian era tale of St. Nicholas saving two Spanish children who were trapped in a barrel of pickles by an innkeeper.\n"}

{"id": "3528613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3528613", "title": "Curry puff", "text": "Curry puff\n\nCurry puff (; ; , , ) is a snack of Southeast Asian origin. It is a small pie consisting of curry with chicken and potatoes in a deep-fried or baked pastry shell. The curry is quite thick to prevent it from oozing out of the snack.\n\nA common snack in Malaysia and Singapore, the curry puff is one of several \"puff\" type pastries with different fillings, though now it is by far the most common. Other common varieties include eggs, sardines, and onions or sweet fillings such as yam.\n\nCurry puffs are enjoyed throughout Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand. It also shares many similarities with the empanada, a popular pastry in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\nIn Indonesia, a curry puff is known as a \"pastel\", although it does not necessarily contain any curry powder. Pastels are derived from the Portuguese influence in Indonesia. It refers to a pie of crust made from thin pastry, filled with meat (usually chicken) mixed with vegetables (chopped carrot and beans), rice vermicelli, and sometimes egg, then deep fried in vegetable oil. It is consumed as a snack and is commonly sold in Indonesian traditional markets.\n\nThe similar North Sulawesi version replaces the thin flour pie crust with bread, and is filled with spicy \"cakalang\" (skipjack tuna). This variation of the snack is called \"panada\". This snack is very popular during Ramadhan.\n\nThe similar Riau Islands version of curry puff is called \"epok-epok\".\n\nIn Malaysia, this snack can be found in many stores, especially at Indian and Malay food stalls. Another Malay version of this snack is known as \"epok-epok\" and \"teh-teh\" which is smaller than the curry puff. The curry puffs from Indian bakeries differ from \"epok-epok\" in the use of 'layered' pastry that creates a flaky crust. Other varieties of the epok epok are filled with a half boiled egg instead of chicken. Another alternative is tinned sardines.There are also vegetarian curry puffs that are in fact not spicy and made from shredded radish, tofu, potatoes and grated carrots. They are often eaten with sweet chili sauce. There is also relatively large and nice looking version of curry puff called shell curry puff sold in shopping malls of Isetan and AEON and others in Malaysia.\n\nManufacturers have developed a version of the curry puff that can be frozen and later reheated by the consumer. These are suitable for the export market and can be produced in volume for shipment to various regions, such as the Middle East, where there is demand. In addition, new fillings have been experimented with, including tuna and black pepper.\n\nIn Indian food stalls in Malaysia, it is quite common to find vegetarian curry puffs with potatoes, carrots and onions as fillings.\n\nThe curry puff is a common snack sold in Chinatowns and tea shops throughout Myanmar, where is known as \"be tha mont\" (; lit. \"duck pastry\"). The traditional filling is duck meat and potato spiced with garam masala, onions, powdered chili peppers, garlic, and ginger.\n\nCurry puffs are commonly seen in Singapore's Pasar Malams and other stalls in shopping centres. Additionally, the aforementioned epok-epok is a popular variation in some of Singapore's hawker centres, usually amongst Malay stalls. Alternatively, the more common type of curry puff has a thick or flaky English-style crust, with a mixture of Chinese and Indian styles in the filling.\n\nThey may also be categorized into hand-made or mass-produced machine-made puffs. Both variations are popular in Singapore, although some might argue that the former is typically more delicious.\n\nOther puff snacks modelled on the curry puff concept have also been introduced. For example, 1A Crispy Puff also sells puffs with yam, durian, corn, red bean, nata de coco, grass jelly, bird's nest and even custard fillings.\n\nBesides the more \"exotic\" fillings mentioned, there are also more conventional flavours which are quite popular with the locals. These puffs are readily available in Singapore, which include sardine, black-pepper chicken and tuna fillings. For example, Pie Connection sells these hand-made puffs.\n\nIn Singapore, Old Chang Kee has been selling curry puffs for over 60 years and now has outlets all over Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and UK. Other well-known brands include 1A Crispy Puff and Sim Sun Pastries. Polar Puffs and Cakes introduced a version of the curry puff that uses Western puff pastry, which has a different taste and shape.\n\nIn Thailand, a curry puff is known as a \"Karipap\" (กะหรี่ปั๊บ). Assumed to have been adapted from Portuguese cuisine \"pastel\", it arrived in Thailand since the Ayutthaya period in the reign of King Narai (1633–1688) by Portuguese-Japanese-Bengali lady Maria Guyomar de Pinha like many kinds of Thai desserts such as Thong yip, Thong yot, Foi thong or Luk chup.

While \"chao fen\" is a transliteration of Mandarin, chow fun from Cantonese is the name to which this dish is most often referred in Chinese restaurants in North America.\n\nWhile \"shahe fen\" and \"he fen\" are transliterations based on Mandarin, there are numerous other transliterations based on Cantonese, which include ho fun, hofoen (a Dutch transliteration in Suriname), hor fun, sar hor fun, etc. In addition, \"shahe fen\" is often synonymously called kway teow (粿條), literally \"ricecake strips\", transliteration based on Min Nan Chinese, POJ: kóe-tiâu) or guotiao (Mandarin pinyin: guǒtiáo), as in the name of a dish called \"char kway teow\". However, \"shahe fen\" and \"kway teow\" are strictly and technically not the same (the latter being essentially ricecakes sliced into strips) and the Min Nans in general still consciously make a distinction between \"shahe fen\" and \"kway teow\" in their speech. \"Hor fun\" is perfected by the Cantonese and is thin and tapered like a tape with some porous areas that absorbs the gravy, taste and flavour of the broth because it contains less starchy content which has been stripped away during the production process. In contrast, guotiao or kuay teow is dense, and less absorbent and contains a higher level of starch and is more impermeable to absorbing flavours, thus the latter has to be soaked for a longer period of time in the dish preparation usually for a day or more, or it is soaked in water first for a long time before it is fried and is \"char kway teow\". The taste, texture, flavour, ingredients, length, thickness, width, style, density are very different for the Chinese and Asian tastebuds but most foreigners may not be able to tell the difference immediately. Kway Teow has a different origin, from Northeast instead of Central China, and is a modification of the Guo or the Kway making process, the ancient preservation of rice as a starch-filled cake patty, of which the Korean rice strips is one of its descendants, as it was brought as a recipe from China to Chosen dynasty when the Emperor of China during the Ming dynasty took the Korean Princess as one of her concubines, this recipe was gifted to the people of Choseon as a betrothal gift to the Korean people. In Hokkien (Fujian) of China, this Kuay went through many influences by the Cantonese version of the shahe hefun. Cantonese culture from the 17th century onwards was thought of as the dominant culture of civilization and culture, of wealth, excess and sophistication, so the ancient Kway underwent modification to become similar to the Standard Cantonese Hor Fun. However, these two strains were spread to Southeast Asia and the world differently, thus they are presented differently in different dishes. Good Chinese restaurants do not mix up or confuse the two, but regular mall versions of Chinese takeout often confuse the two. Original ricecakes or its strips are very stiff in texture (even after cooking), making them unpopular with modern consumers. The other noodle confused by the Westerns is the \"nee tai mak\" which is like the hor fun and the bee hoon combined with Milanese pasta.\n\nIt is also known in Sabah as \"da fen\" (大粉), means \"wide vermicelli\", due to its similarity of colour and texture to rice vermicelli.\n\nThese noodles are called guay tiew sen yai (, meaning \"large rice noodles\") in Thailand, kwetiau in Indonesia and Pho in Vietnam as its counterpart version.\n\n\"Shahe fen\" is believed to have originated in the town of Shahe (), now part of the Tianhe District in the city of Guangzhou, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, whence their name derives. \"Shahe fen\" is typical of southern Chinese cuisine, although similar noodles are also prepared and enjoyed in nearby Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, all of which have sizeable Chinese populations.\n\n\"Shahe fen\" noodles are white in color, broad, and somewhat slippery. Their texture is elastic and a bit chewy. They do not freeze or dry well and are thus generally (where available) purchased fresh, in strips or sheets that may be cut to the desired width. Where fresh noodles are not available, they may also be purchased packaged in dried form, in various widths.\n\n\"Shahe fen\" noodles are very similar to Vietnamese \"bánh phở\" noodles, which are likely derived from their Chinese counterpart. Although the \"phở\" noodles used in soups may vary in width, wide \"phở\" noodles are also common in stir fried dishes. The popular Thai dishes \"phat si-io\" and \"drunken noodles\" are also made with similar noodles.\n\n\"Shahe fen\" is often stir fried with meat and vegetables in a dish called chao fen (炒粉; pinyin: chǎo fěn). While \"chao fen\" is a transliteration of Mandarin, chow fun from Cantonese is the name to which this dish is most often referred in Chinese restaurants in North America.\n"}

The principal ingredients are rice flour and water. Sometimes ingredients such as tapioca or corn starch are added in order to improve the transparency or increase the gelatinous and chewy texture of the noodles. \n\nRice noodles are most common in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia, and are available fresh, frozen, or dried, in various shapes, thicknesses and textures. However, fresh noodles are highly perishable; their shelf life may be just several days. The shelf life may be extended by drying and removing its moisture content. Studies of drying rice noodles were conducted by the International Food Research Journal.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu and parts of Kerala, Sri Lanka, Laos, Singapore, and Malaysia, a type of rice noodle known as \"idiyappam\" is usually made fresh at home and tends to be tender with a distinctive texture. A variation of \"idiappam\", known as sevai in Tamil Nadu, is used as the base in savoury preparations; it is also called \"santhakai\" or \"sandhavai\" in the Coimbatore region of Tamil Nadu. A similar preparation, \"shyavige\", is popular in Karnataka.\n\nPasta made from brown rice flour is also available (in health food stores in Western nations) as an alternative to wheat flour-based noodles for individuals who are allergic to wheat or gluten.\n\nRice noodles originated in China during the Qin dynasty, historical records show that when people from northern China invaded the south, they preferred noodles made from wheat flour because they were not accustomed to eating rice. Due to climatic conditions, the northern Chinese have traditionally preferred wheat and millet which grew in cold weather while the southern Chinese preferred rice which grew in hot weather. To adapt, northern cooks tried to prepare \"noodles\" using rice, thus inventing rice noodles. Over time rice noodles and their processing methods have been introduced around the world, becoming especially popular in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n"}

The name originates from the Old Slavonic word kolo (коло) meaning \"circle\", \"wheel\".\n\nThe Hungarian kalács (pronounced ]) is a sweet bread very similar to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and traditionally considered an Easter food. Until the end of the 19th century, the preparation of kalács was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kalács. Nowadays kalács is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or on a baking sheet.\n\nKalács is part of the traditional Easter menu in Hungary, often consecrated together with ham in Catholic churches. In the Szeged region at All Saints unfilled kalács was baked called All Saints' Kalács (mindenszentek kalácsa, kolduskalács = Beggar's Kalács), which was given to beggars at the gate of the graveyard. Also kalács was given to beggars praying at the graveyard's gate in Csallóköz to prevent the dead from returning. Giving kalács to beggars is the Christian form of the pagan tradition of treating the dead.\n\nThe traditional Romanian \"colac\" is a braided bread, typically made for special occasions or holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, weddings, and funerals. It is a traditional custom of Romanian rural society, on Christmas Eve, to gather in groups, to go in different houses and to sing \"colinde\", traditional Christmas carols. In some villages, they go first to the mayor's house, followed by the teacher's house, whereas in other parts there is no pre-established order. The families would then invite them into the house, and give them different small gifts such as nuts, dried fruits, and colacs.\n\nThe word came from Slavic \"kolač\" and ultimately from Proto-Slavic \"kolo\" (\"circle\", \"wheel\") referring to the circular form. The word may be cognate with \"challah\" ( \"ḥallah\") and Greek ϰολλιξ.\n\nIn modern Russian, \"kalach\" refers to a specific type of twisted white bread. Historically, kalach meant any kind of white bread, and before modern methods of grinding wheat came into use, white bread was classed as a type of fancy bread.\n\nKalach usually looks like a circle, but one part of is it significantly thinner, and the other is significantly thicker. The traditional explanation is that the thinner part was used as a \"handle\" so kalach could be eaten even by workers who had no time to wash their hands. After eating, the handle was thrown away or given to the poor. Because only desperate people ate the handles that had been thrown away, this is thought to be the origin of the Russian saying \"go down to the handle\" (дойти до ручки, \"doyti do ruchki\") meaning to experience a profound setback, to hit rock bottom. \n\nA man who made kalaches was called a \"kalachnik\" (калачник), which sometimes became \"kalashnik\" (калашник) due to the sandhi effect. Such a man's descendants might be given the surname \"Kalachnikov\" (Калачников) or \"Kalashnikov\" (Калашников, \"[son] of the kalach-maker\").\n\nUkrainian kolaches are made by braiding dough made with wheat flour into ring-shaped or oblong forms. They are a symbol of luck, prosperity, and good bounty, and are traditionally prepared for \"Svyat Vechir (Holy Supper)\", the Ukrainian Christmas Eve ritual, most often in the form of three round bread loaves stacked one atop the other with a candle in the middle.\n\nIn the area around Kiev, it was custom for a midwife to give a kolach as a gift to parents, as part of a fertility blessing. Kalaches were also used in funeral ceremonies. As well in Galicia and Bukovina they were given by children to their godparents in ceremony called a \"kolachyny\" (кола́чини) or \"kolachannya\" (кола́чання).\n\nThe Bread Museum in L'viv, Ukraine, contains many examples of intricately woven kalach, paska, and babka.\n"}

It is rooted in Javanese history and religiosity, syncretizing aspects of different religions.\n\nThe term \"kebatinan\" is being used interchangeably with \"kejawèn\", \"Agama Jawa\" and \"Kepercayaan\", although they are not exactly the same:\n\n\"Kebatinan\" is the inner-directed cultivation of inner peace, rooted in pre-Islamic traditions, whereas \"kejawèn\" is outer-directed and community-oriented, manifesting in rituals and practices.\n\nJava has been a melting pot of religions and cultures, which has created a broad range of religious belief, including animism, spirit cults, and cosmology.\n\nIndian influences came firstly in the form of Hinduism, which reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. By the fourth century, the kingdom of Kutai in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java, and Holing (Kalingga) in Central Java, were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Several notable ancient Indonesian Hindu kingdoms are Mataram, famous for the construction of the majestic Prambanan temple, followed by Kediri and Singhasari. Since then Hinduism, along with Buddhism, spread across the archipelago and reached the peak of its influence in the fourteenth century. The last and largest of the Hindu-Buddhist Javanese empires, that of the Majapahit, influenced the entire Indonesian archipelago.\n\nHinduism and Buddhism penetrated deeply into all aspects of society, blending with the indigenous tradition and culture. One conduit for this were the ascetics, called \"resi,\" (Sanskrit rishi) who taught a variety of mystical practices. A resi lived surrounded by students, who took care of their master's daily needs. Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and \"pudjangga\" (sacred literati) legitimized rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs. Presently, small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout Java, but there is a large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest Bali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi.\n\nJava adopted Islam around 1500 CE. Islam was first accepted by the elites and upper echelons of society, which contributed to the further spread and acceptance. Sufism and other versions of Folk Islam were most easily integrated into the existing folk religion of Java. The learned versions of Sufi Islam and Shari`a-oriented Islam were integrated at the courts, blending with the rituals and myths of the existing Hindu-Buddhist culture. Clifford Geertz described this as abangan and priyayi; \"the lower class and elite varieties of Javanese syncretism\".\n\nThe Kyai, the Muslim scholar of the writ became the new religious elite as Hindu influences receded. Islam recognises no hierarchy of religious leaders nor a formal priesthood, but the Dutch colonial government established an elaborate rank order for mosque and other Islamic preaching schools. In Javanese \"pesantren\" (Islamic schools), The \"Kyai\" perpetuated the tradition of the \"resi\". Students around him provided his needs, even peasants around the school.\n\nChristianity was brought to Java by Portuguese traders and missionaries, from the Dutch Reformed Church, and in the 20th century also by Roman Catholics, such as the Jesuits and the Divine Word Missionaries. Nowadays there are Christian communities, mostly Reformed in the larger cities, though some rural areas of south-central Java are strongly Roman Catholic. Roman Catholics and other Christian groups have been persecuted for their beliefs such as a ban on Christmas services or decorations.\n\nNowadays more than 90 percent of the people of Java are Muslims, on a broad continuum between \"abangan\" and \"santri\". Although Java is nominally Islamitic, \"kejawen\", the syncretic Javanese culture, is a strong undercurrent. Pre-Islamic Javan traditions have encouraged Islam in a mystical direction.\n\nSome Javanese texts relate stories about Syekh Siti Jenar (also known as Syekh Lemah Abang) who had conflicts with Wali Sanga, the nine Islamic scholars in Java, and the Sultanate of Demak. Although Syekh Siti Jenar was a sufi whose teaching were similar with Al-Hallaj, most of his followers (\"Ki Kebo Kenanga\") come from Kebatinan. Some historians have doubted the existence of Syekh Siti Jenar, suggesting the stories represent conflicts between Kebatinan and Islam in the past.\n\nWith the Islamisation of Java there emerged a loosely structured society of religious leadership, revolving around kyais, Islamic experts possessing various degrees of proficiency in pre-Islamic and Islamic lore, belief and practice. The kyais are the principal intermediaries between the villages masses and the realm of the supernatural. However, this very looseneess of kyai leadership structure has promoted schism. There were often sharp divisions between orthodox kyais, who merely instructed in Islamic law, with those who taught mysticism and those who sought reformed Islam with modern scientific concepts.\n\nAs a result, the Javanese recognize two broad streams of religious commitment:\n\nThis distinction between \"the High Islam or scripturalist, shari`a-oriented Islam of the `ulama\" and \"living local Islam\" or \"Folk Islam\" or \"popular Islam\" is not restricted to Java, but can be found in other Islamic countries as well.\n\nErnest Gellner has developed an influential model of Muslim society, in which this dichotomy is central:\nBruinessen finds this too limited, and distinguishes three overlapping spheres:\n\nJavanese syncretistic religiousness has a strong popular base, outnumbering the santri and the support for Islamic political parties. Choy relates this to a Javanese apparent openness to new religions, but filtering out only those elements which fit into the Javanese culture. Choy mentions several reasons for this nominal Islamic identity:\n\nIn the early 20th century, several groups became formalised, developing systemetised teachings and rituals, thus offering a 'high' form of \"abangan\" religiosity, as an alternative to the 'high' Islam. Bruinessen opines that the kebatinan-movements is a deliberate rejection of scriptural Islam, which arose out of \"folk Islam\".\n\n\"Kebatinan\" is derived from the Arabic word \"batin\", meaning \"inner\" or \"hidden\", or \"inner self\". It is a metaphysical search for harmony within one's inner self, connection with the universe, and with an Almighty God. \"Kebatinan\" believe in a \"super-consciousness\" which can be contacted through meditation.\n\n\"Kebatinan\" is a combination of metaphysics, mysticism and other esoteric doctrines from Animistic, Hinduistic, Buddhist and Islamic origins. Although the Javanese culture is tolerant, and open to new religions, only those qualities are accepted and filtered which fit into the Javanese culture, character and personality. Javanese ideals combine human wisdom (\"wicaksana\"), psyche (\"waskita\") and perfection (\"sempurna\"). The follower must control his/her passions, eschewing earthly riches and comforts, so that he/she may one day reach enlightened harmony and union with the spirit of the universe.\n\nAccording to Choy, the \"Kebatinan\" have no certain prophet, sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals. Nevertheless, various kebatinan-movements have their own foundational writings and founders.\n\nA \"kebatinan\" practitioner can identify with one of the six officially recognized religions, while still subscribe to the \"kebatinan\" belief and way of life.\n\nAlthough \"kebatinan\" is a predominantly Javanese tradition, it has also attracted practitioners from other ethnic and religious groups, such as Chinese and Buddhists, and foreigners from Australia and Europe. President Suharto counted himself as one of its adherents. Their total membership is difficult to estimate as many of their adherents identify themselves with one of the official religions.\n\nThe Indonesian state ideology strives toward a unified nation, recognizing only monotheism. Meanwhile, there is also a tolerance for non-recognized religions. A broad plurality of religions and sects exist. In the middle of 1956, the Department of Religious Affairs in Yogyakarta reported 63 religious sects in Java other than the official Indonesian religions. Of these, 22 were in West Java, 35 were in Central Java, and 6 in East Java.\n\nThese include also kebatinan-groups, such as Sumarah. This loosely organized current of thought and practice was legitimized in the 1945 constitution, but failed to attain official recognition as a religion. In 1973 it was recognized as \"Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa\" (Indonesian: Belief in One Mighty God), but withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Religion and placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Culture.\n\nA variety of practices is being used in kebatinan to acquire \"ilmu\", namely \"tiraka\" and \"tapa\" or \"tapabrata\".\n\nMany Kebatinan followers practice in their own way to seek spiritual and emotional relief. These practices are not performed in churches or mosques, but at home or in caves or on mountain perches. Meditation in Javanese culture is a search for inner self wisdom and to gain physical strength. This tradition is passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThere are several \"tapa\":\n\nFasting is a common practice employed by Javanese spiritualists in order to attain discipline of mind and body to get rid of material and emotional desires:\n\n\"Kebatinan\" often implies animistic worship, because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artifacts, and grave sites of important wali (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits, and if sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, the advice of a \"dukun\" or healer is sought.\n\nOther practices include:\n\nKebatinan and \"kejawen\" practices are extensively written about in texts that are held in the Sonobudoyo library in Yogyakarta, and the main Kraton Libraries of Surakarta and Yogyakarta. Many of the texts are deliberately elliptical so that those who do not work with either initiates or teachers are unable to ascertain or understand the esoteric doctrines and practices. In quite a few cases codified texts with secret systems to \"unlock\" the meanings are employed.\n\nBut according to Bruinessen, the writing down of kebatinan teachings was a novelty which appeared with the institutinalisation of the kebatinan-movements in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe appearance of formal kebatinan movements reflects the modernisation of Indonesia. Kebatinan movements appeared early in the 1900s in urban traditional elite circles, together with the rise of nationalism and the Muhammadiyah, a modernist Islamic movement. Hardopusoro, one of the earliest kebatinan-movements, had strong links with the Theosophical Society. Some remained very elitist, while others also accepted lower urban and rural followings, thereby popularising abangan, or syncretistic Islam, as an alternative to shari`a-oriented Islam.\n\nAfter the independence of 1949, the kebatinan received political support and attracted large followings. Kebatinan-movements were seen by secular nationalistic elites as allies against the rise of political Islam. The political struggle between the Muslim parties and the Communists and Nationalists lead to a sharper demarcation between syncretistic and shari`a-oriented Islam, whereby most kebatinan movements affiliated with the Communist or Nationalist Parties.\n\nUmbrella organisations representing several hundred kebatinan organisations, lobbied to attain legitimacy and recognition as an official religion. They are registered at the HKP (Himpunan Penghayat Kepercayaan), which is controlled by the PAKEM (Pengawas Aliran Kepercayaan Masyarakat). After the Suharto-era (1967-1998), the kebatinan-movements lost political support, and have become less dynamic, their adherents avoiding public engagement.\n\nAltogether several hundred kebatinan-groups are or have been registered, the best-known of which are:\n\nSubud was founded in the 1920s by Muhammad Subuh Sumohadiwidjojo. The name Subud was first used in the late 1940s when Subud was legally registered in Indonesia. The basis of Subud is a spiritual exercise commonly referred to as the \"latihan kejiwaan\", which was said by Muhammad Subuh to be guidance from \"the Power of God\" or \"the Great Life Force\". The aim of Subud is to attain perfection of character according to the will of God. Only when passion, heart and mind are separated from the inner feeling is it possible to make contact with the \"Great Life Force\" which permeates everywhere.\n\nThe name \"Subud\" is formed from the words \"susila\" (\"the good character of man\"), \"budhi\" (\"the force of the inner self\") and \"dharma\" (\"trust in God\"). These words are derived from the Sanskrit words \"susila\", \"bodhi\" and \"dharma\".\n\nMuhammad Subuh saw the present age as one that demands personal evidence and proof of religious or spiritual realities, as people no longer just believe in words. He claimed that Subud is not a new teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. He also rejected the classification of Subud as a kebatinan organization. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.\n\nSumarah was formed in the 1930s by Pak Hardo, Pak Sadina and Pak Sutadi, without a formal organisation. In those early days, the younger members were taught \"kanoman\", occult practices including invulnerability for knives and guns. This was regarded as essential in the struggle against the Dutch colonial powers. Around 1950, when Indonesia became an independent nation, Sumarah was streamlined and organised by Dr. Surono. The emphasis shifted from magic to \"surrender to God\". From 1957 on internal struggles surfaced between dr. Surono and the founders Pak Hardo and Pak Sadina, leading to a change in leadership by dr. Ary Muthy in 1967.\n\nSumarah theology maintains that humankind's soul is like the holy spirit, a spark from the Divine Essence, which means that we are in essence similar to God. In other words, \"One can find God within oneself,\" a belief similar to the \"I=God\" theory found in Hindu-Javanese literature.\n\nAccording to Sumarah theology, man and his physical and spiritual world are divided into three parts:\n\nSumarah's conception of God is different from Islam. It has a pantheistic vision of reality, considering God to be present in all living beings.\n\nPangestu was founded in 1949. Its doctrine was revealed in 1932 to Sunarto Mertowarjoyo, and written down in the \"Setat Sasangka Djati\" by R.T. Harjoparakowo and R. Trihardono Sumodiharjo Pangastu. It describes the way to obtain \"wahyu\", the blessing of God.\n\nSapta Dharma was founded in 1952 by Harjo Sapura, after he received a revelation. According to Sri Pawenang, it was God's wish to provide the Indonesian people with a new spirituality in atime of crisis. Its aim is to free man of his passions.\n\nAccording to Sapta Dharma teachings, \"suji\" (meditation) is necessary to pierce through different layers of obstacles to reach Semar, the guardian spirit of Java. Theory and practice resemble Hindu Kundalini yoga, aiming at awakening the Kundalini energy and guiding it through the chakras.\n\nMajapahit Pancasila was founded by W. Hardjanta Pardjapangarsa. It is based in Javanese Hindu-yogic practices, c.q. Kundalini yoga, rather than Balinese ritual practice as is prevalent in Parisada Hindu Dharma. According to Hardjanta, his meditation practices also lead to invulnerability for knives, daggers and other weapons.\n\nKebatinan beliefs have spread to some parts of Malaysia, wherein certain individuals have combined it with Islamic concepts (e.g. proclaiming themselves to be new-age Islamic prophets, but delivering messages that are a combination of Islamic and kebatinan beliefs). This has led to the Malaysian Islamic authorities declaring elements of kebatinan to be \"syirik\" (shirk) and un-Islamic. Kebatinan interpretations of Islam are widespread in Malaysia among practitioners of silat, traditional healers, and some preachers (such as Ariffin Mohammed and other self-proclaimed Islamic prophets).\n\nIn the Netherlands, the former colonial power in Indonesia, some kebatinan-groups are active.\n\nSince the majority of Singaporean Malays are of Indonesian descent, particularly from Java, many of Kebatinan are still practiced usually among older people. However, the practice is still widespread among some Javanese Silat and Kuda Kepang groups, and also traditional shamans.\n\nIt was brought to Suriname by Javanese workers in the late 19th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Seasoning is generally done at the table according to personal taste by adding salt, ground black pepper, red pepper, minced garlic, or chopped spring onions. It is a local dish of Seoul.\n\n\"Seolleongtang\" is typically simmered over a low flame over a period of several hours to an entire day, to allow the flavor to be gradually extracted from the bones. It has a milky off-white, cloudy appearance and is normally eaten together with rice and several side dishes; the rice is sometimes added directly to the soup.\n\nIn the Joseon dynasty, Koreans regularly made nationwide sacrifices to their ancestors, such as Dangun (the legendary founder of the kingdom of Gojoseon). The nationwide sacrifice was called \"Sŏnnong\"je (hangul: 선농제; hanja: 先農祭, \"Sŏnnong\" meaning \"venerated farmer\"), and the altar for the sacrifice was called \"Sŏnnong dan\" (hangul: 선농단; hanja: 先農壇), which dates back to the Silla Dynasty.\n\nKing Seongjong had visited the sacrifice himself, and had eaten a meal with the people of Joseon. To increase the food supply in Joseon, King Seongjong ordered them to invent dishes that could feed the maximum number of people using the fewest ingredients, and \"seonnongtang\" (\"tang\" meaning \"soup\") was one of these.\n\nAnother historical opinion precedes the Joseon dynasty concerning the origin of seolleongtang. According to this, the food was originated by the Mongolian invasion of Koryo in 13 BC. Mongolian food \"Sulen\" is sliced and boiled beef with green onions, which developed into seolleongtang in Korea. \n\n\"Seonnongtang\" is now called \"seolleongtang\" for easier pronunciation. The phonetic values have changed as follows:\n\n\nThe first change is a consonant liquidization making the two \"N\" sounds into softer \"L\" sounds for easy pronunciation. The second change is a vowel harmonization of the \"O\" sound affected by the \"Ŏ\" sound.\n\nAmong common misbeliefs related to the dish, the name may come from its snowy white color and hearty taste, so \"seolleongtang\" was named \"雪濃湯\" in hanja (literally \"snowy thick soup\"). Therefore, several Korean dictionaries say that the hanja spelling such as 雪濃湯 is an incorrect usage for the dish. Nevertheless, the misspelling is used to refer to the soup in hanja.\n\n"}

It forms an important part of Tuluva-Mangalorean cuisine and takes its name from Udupi, a city on the southwest coast of India in the Tulunadu region. Udupi cuisine has its origin in the Tulu Ashta Mathas of Udupi founded by Madhvacharya.\n\nUdupi cuisine comprises dishes made primarily from grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits. The variety and range of dishes is wide, and a hallmark of the cuisine involves the use of locally available ingredients.\n\nIt adheres strictly to the Satvik tradition of Indian vegetarian cuisine, using no onions or garlic, as well as no meat, fish, or shellfish. However, the cuisine may also be adapted for those who consume these restricted items. Following the tradition of chaaturmasa vrata, which is a restriction of certain food ingredients in a certain period or season, may have led to the innovation of a variety of dishes in Udupi cuisine. Pumpkins and gourds are the main ingredients in \"sambar\", a stew prepared with ground coconut and coconut oil as its base.\n\nThe ubiquitous Indian dish dosa has its origins in Udupi, according to P. Thankappan Nair. Saaru, a spicy pepper water, is another essential part of the menu, and so are jackfruit, colocasia leaves, raw green bananas, mango pickle, red chillies, and salt. Adyes (dumplings), \"ajadinas\" (dry curries or stir fry curries), and chutneys, including one made of the skin of the ridge gourd, are specialities.\n\nThe full course Udupi meal is served on a plantain leaf, which is traditionally kept on the ground. The dishes are served in a particular sequence, and each dish is placed on a particular spot of the plantain leaf. All the people eating this meal are expected to begin and end eating the meal together. A person cannot get up in middle of the meal, even though he has finished his meal. The start and end of meal is done by saying \"\"Govinda\",\" the name of Lord Vishnu. A typical meal is served with the following (in sequence):\nDepending upon the occasion, individual taste, and money, each dish may be made from different ingredients.\n\n\nUdupi or Udipi restaurants and hotels serving Udupi cuisine can be found all over India and many parts of the world. In the past, these restaurants were run by cooks and priests trained at Krishna matha in Udupi. With rising popularity, many others have entered this business claiming to serve authentic Udupi cuisine. Most Udupi restaurants and hotels are family run, with ownership passing among kith and kin of the original owner. Udupi restaurants have undergone many changes in their menu in recent times, adapting to changing economic structure and social statuses in India. They have included vegetarian delicacies from other Indian cuisines.\n\nThe first major South Kanara hotel owner, K. Krishna Rao, who worked first joined Sharada Vilas Brahmins Hotel in George Town, Chennai as a kitchen servant. He is the inventor of Masala Dosa. In 1925 his employer offered him one of his restaurants for ₹ 700 monthly. In 1939 Rao started his first hotel, now called Old Woodlands. The other prominent chain of Udupi hotels is the Dasaprakash group founded by K. Seetharama Rao, who gave up a low-grade salaried position in Mangalore to join his brothers' snack food (\"tiffin\") business in Mysore in 1921.\n\n\n"}

In the special case when the graph is unweighted, Karger's algorithm provides an efficient randomized method for finding the cut. In this case, the minimum cut equals the edge connectivity of the graph.\n\nA generalization of the minimum cut problem without terminals is the minimum -cut, in which the goal is to partition the graph into at least connected components by removing as few edges as possible. For a fixed value of , this problem can be solved in polynomial time, though the algorithm is not practical for large . \n\nWhen two terminals are given, they are typically referred to as a source and sink. In a directed, weighted flow network, the minimum cut separates the source and sink vertices and minimizes the total weight on the edges that are directed from the source side of the cut to the sink side of the cut. As shown in the max-flow min-cut theorem, the weight of this cut equals the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink in the given network.\n\nIn a weighted, undirected network, it is possible to calculate the cut that separates a particular pair of vertices from each other and has minimum possible weight. A system of cuts that solves this problem for every possible vertex pair can be collected into a structure known as the Gomory–Hu tree of the graph.\n\nA generalization of the minimum cut problem with terminals is the -terminal cut, or multiterminal cut. This problem is NP-hard, even for formula_1.\n\nGraph partition problems are a family of combinatorial optimization problems in which a graph is to be partitioned into two or more parts with additional constraints such as balancing the sizes of the two sides of the cut.\n\nA graph with formula_2 vertices can at the most have formula_3 distinct minimum cuts.\nThis bound is tight in the sense that a (simple) cycle on formula_2 vertices has exactly formula_5 minimum cuts.\n\n"}

It is a typical Hungarikum. It is usually made of fondant, covered by chocolate and wrapped in shiny coloured foil, then hung on the Christmas tree as decoration.\n\nEvery year, almost a kilo and a half of it are consumed per household during Christmas season.\n\nThe tradition of hanging these candies on the Christmas tree started in the 19th century. It was named \"szaloncukor\" because the tree usually stood in the parlour (\"szalon\" in Hungarian; \"Cukor\" means \"sugar\" or \"candy\"; in Slovak \"salón\" is \"parlour\" and \"-ka\" is diminutive suffix).\n\nThe name comes from the German-Austrian \"Salonzuckerl\", this is why the original name was \"szalonczukkedli\".\n\nThe whole procedure was manual until the first fondant-machines have appeared. These were made by Stühmer chocolate factory for the famous sweet-shop, Gerbaud. The last part of the procedure to be mechanized was the thrumming of the end of the papercover. Considering that it has such a typical shape to keep, this part was not to be omitted.\n\nFondant candies originally came in a few flavours (vanilla and strawberry for example), but now there is a wide variety of different kinds of candies, including jelly, coconut, hazelnut and lots of other flavors. It is usually hung on the tree with strings or small metal hooks. It is considered traditional on children's part, no matter how adults may frown, to empty all the wrappers on the tree before the season is out.\n\nThe earliest version of this fondant dessert emerged during the 14th century in France and was called \"fondantcukor\". The recipe was altered through the years of European confectionery history. French pastry chef Pierre-Andre Manion in the 17th century introduced \"fondantcukor\" recipe in Germany.\n\nThe popularity of the fondant candies reached the shores of Hungary when German craftsmen migrated there in the 19th century. German wealthy families would erect Christmas trees in the entrance halls of their homes (called salons) and decorate them with sweets wrapped in shiny paper.\n\nSuch candies were made first in the 14th century in France. By the beginning of the 19th century it came through German intermediates to Hungary. In 1891, Hungarian-French chef and entrepreneur Hegyesi Joseph coined the name Szaloncukor which is derived from German fondant candy called \"Salonzuckerl\" which mean \"Sugar in Salons\".\n\nThe mass production of fondant candies wrapped in foil packaging was manufactured by steam-powered engines in 1883 in Hungary, mostly dedicated for creating traditional cakes of Gerbeaud brand.\n\nFollowing Gerbeaud as inspiration, the family of Geza Kugler founded a chocolate factory in 1886. Both Gerbeauds and Kuglers adopted their own version of the recipe by publishing 19th-century recipe books of Hungarian confectionery. By the end of the 1800s, the candies were packed in tinfoil balls and colored tissue papers.\n\nIn 1941, the Kuglers opened the largest chocolate factory in Hungary.\n\nIn 1951 chocolate factory DEVA was found in Trebišov, Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia), which has been producing one of the best known chocolate Christmas candy in Slovakia, including \"parlour candy\" (\"salónky\").

The cake is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, China, and also the Netherlands, especially among Indo community, due to its historical colonial ties with Indonesia.\n\nIn 2017, CNN named pandan cake as the national cake of Malaysia and Singapore, one of favorite cakes from around the world.\n\nThe cake shares common ingredients with other cakes, which includes flour, eggs, butter or margarine, and sugar. However, the distinct ingredient is the use of pandan leaf, which give the cake its green hue. The cakes are light green in tone due to the chlorophyll in the leaf juice. It also sometimes contains green food colouring to further enhance its colour. The cakes are not always made with the leaf juice but rather flavored with \"Pandanus\" extract, in which case colouring is added if a green colour is desired.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the cake-making technique was brought into the region through European colonisation. In the past, Indonesia was a Dutch colony, while Malaysia and Singapore were British possessions. Naturally, the European colonists brought their cuisine along with them, with the most obvious impact in bread, cake and pastry-making techniques. In Southeast Asian cuisine, the pandan leaf is a much loved flavouring agent employed to give a pleasant aroma, and added to various dishes, from fragrant coconut rice, traditional cakes, to sweet desserts and drinks. It was the fusion of European cake-making techniques with locally grown ingredients that created the pandan flavoured cake.\n\nThe exact origin of the cake is unclear. However, the pandan cake was probably of Indonesian or Malaysian origins with Dutch influence.\n\n"}
{"id": "3584433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3584433", "title": "Cuban bread", "text": "Cuban bread\n\nCuban bread is a fairly simple white bread, similar to French bread and Italian bread, but has a slightly different baking method and ingredient list (in particular, it generally includes a small amount of fat in the form of lard or vegetable shortening); it is usually made in long, baguette-like loaves. It is a staple of Cuban-American cuisine and is traditionally the bread of choice when making an authentic Cuban sandwich.\n\nThe origins of \"real\" Cuban bread are debated, with both Miami and Tampa, Florida claiming to be the home of the best. With regards to where it originated, the first commercial bakery in the U.S. to produce Cuban bread was most likely \"La Joven Francesca\" bakery, which was established by the Sicilian-born Francisco Ferlita in 1896 in Ybor City, a thriving Cuban-Spanish-Italian community in Tampa. The bakery originally sold bread for 3 to 5 cents per loaf, many of which were delivered every morning like milk. Houses in Ybor City often had a sturdy nail driven into the door frame on the front porch, and a bread deliveryman would impale the fresh loaf of bread onto the nail before dawn.\n\nFerlita's bakery was destroyed by fire in 1922, leaving only the brick bread oven standing. It was rebuilt and expanded, and it soon became a major supplier of Cuban bread for the Tampa area. The bakery also added a dining area which became a place to congregate, drink a cup of Cuban coffee, and catch up on the local news. \"La Joven Francesca\" closed in 1973, but soon found new life when it was renovated and converted into the Ybor City State Museum. The original ovens where the original Cuban bread was baked are still viewable inside.\n\nLa Segunda Bakery in Ybor City is currently the largest producer of Cuban bread in the world and ships the product all over Florida and beyond. It was co-founded by Juan Morè, who migrated to Tampa from Spain via Cuba and became a partner in a bakery co-op with three locations: \"\"La Primera\"\", \"\"La Segunda\"\", and \"\"La Tercera\"\" (literally, First, Second, and Third). Morè had been running \"La Primera\", but when the other two bakeries closed in 1915, he bought the larger \"La Segunda\" building. His descendants have been running the bakery ever since, and it still uses Morè's original Cuban bread recipe and many of the same bread-making techniques.\n\nIt is not amiss to say that the Latins in Ybor City make a very fine bread, equal in all respects to the French article of that kind and unexcelled by the Vienna product.\n\n-\"Tampa Daily Journal\", 1896 \n\nA traditional loaf of Cuban bread is approximately three feet long and somewhat rectangular crossways (as compared to the rounder shape of Italian or French bread loaves). It has a hard, thin, almost papery toasted crust and a soft flaky center\n. In the early days, the dough was stretched thin to make it last, creating the bread's distinctive air pockets and long shape. As they have for over a century, La Segunda and a few other traditional Cuban bread producers lay a long, moist palmetto frond on top of the loaves before baking, creating a shallow trench in the upper crust, producing an effect similar to the slashing or scoring of a European-style loaf. (The frond is removed before eating.)\n\nCuban bread is the necessary base for a 'Cuban sandwich' (sometimes called a \"sandwich mixto\"). It can also be served as a simple breakfast, especially toasted and pressed with butter and served alongside (and perhaps dunked into) a hot mug of cafe con leche (strong dark-roasted Cuban coffee with scalded milk).\n\nBecause the traditional recipe uses no preservatives, Cuban bread tends to go stale quickly and becomes hard and dry if not eaten soon after baking. However, it can be frozen for shipping or storage. In Tampa, stale Cuban bread became a key ingredient in other recipes, such as the breading of a deviled crab.\n\nStale Cuban bread is the preferred \"weapon of choice\" in protests performed by the Conch Republic and in mock battles involving the \"Ybor City Navy\" during Tampa's Gasparilla Pirate Festival.\n\n"}

The origin of kalduny is uncertain: they may have originated with equal likelihood in the West (Germany or Czech lands) or in the East (brought by the Tatar-Mongols across Siberia and the Urals). \n\nKalduny, dumplings of unleavened dough filled with meat, mushrooms, or other stuffings, are related to similar dishes in the West and in the East alike, from Italian ravioli, Hungarian derelye, and Ashkenazi Jewish pirogen to Russian pelmeni and Central Asian manti or chuchvara. Kalduny made with a stuffing of smoked ham and mushrooms (\"Kalduny Count Tyshkevich\", named after a Belarusian noble family from Lahojsk near Minsk) were long considered Belarus’s “visiting card”, although decades of Soviet rule almost erased their trace from public memory and now they are only served in a few local restaurants. Currently the Russian pelmeni and the Ukrainian vareniki are served in more restaurants.\n\nThe simplest dough for kalduny is made of flour mixed with tepid water, eggs, and some salt. In some recipes the dough for kalduny is mixed with onion juice, not water. Kalduny dough should be soft but elastic, easy to stretch and to seal into a pocket around a dollop of filling. Like other pastry doughs it has to be allowed to rest, covered with a dish towel or a cloth so as not to dry out. Kalduny are usually boiled in a big shallow casserole at low heat, in well-salted water. Instead of boiling in water, kalduny may be boiled directly in a soup, in which they are then served. Some varieties are baked or fried. , with a stuffing of boiled river fish and hard-boiled eggs, are fried. A variety known in Russian cuisine as \"kundumy\" () is never boiled: the mushroom-filled dumplings are baked in a crock pot in the oven or fried.\n\nKalduny may be served as a main course or a dessert, depending on the stuffing. For the former, meat, mushrooms, farmer cheese, or fish is used; for the latter, fresh berries or sometimes dried fruits may be used. The sauce or topping for kalduny also depends on the stuffing. Kalduny with (mushrooms and smoked pork, as in \"Kalduny Count Tyshkevich\") are topped with melted butter, while the (farmer cheese or mashed potatoes) requires thick sour cream. Dessert kalduny are powdered with cinnamon or topped with fruit syrups. Kalduny are often served in a soup (beef broth or borsht), similarly to Jewish kreplach. The numerous combinations of dough, stuffing, and sauce provide a great potential for variation.\n\nLarge kalduny (manti) are prepared for the major Muslim feasts, which are celebrated by the Tatar population that has lived continuously in Belarus since the end of the 14th century. This variety of kalduny are made with spiced mutton or veal stuffing and are eaten by spoon, so that the dough wrapping doesn't tear and the juice from inside is not lost.\n\nKalduny come with a variety of fillings:\n\n\n\n"}

The domestication of cattle in the region about two thousand years ago by Khoisan groups enabled the use of milk products and the availability of meat.

They are said to be \"souls of the dead that have separated from their bodies,\" which is where their name comes from.\n\nHitodama are mentioned in literature from ancient times. In the Man'yōshū, there is the following poem:\n\nThey are frequently confused with onibi and kitsunebi, but since hitodama are considered to be the \"appearance of souls that have left the body and fly through the air,\" they are strictly speaking a different general idea.\n\nConcerning their shape and nature, there are common features throughout Japan, but some differences could also be seen depending on the area. They fly crawling along at an elevation that is not very high. They have a color that is blue, orange, or red, and also have a tail, but it can either be short or long. There are also a few that have been seen during daytime.\n\nIn the Okinawa Prefecture, hitodama are called , and in Nakijin, they are said to appear before a child is born and in some areas are also said to be mysterious flames that drive off humans to death.\n\nIn Kawakami, Inba District, Chiba Prefecture, (now Yachimata), hitodama are called and are said to come out of the body 2 or 3 days after a human dies, and go toward temples or people they have a deep relation with and are said to make a great sound in storm shutters and gardens, but it is said that this sound can only be heard by those who have a deep relation with the spirit. Also, for those who have not seen a by the time they are 28 years of age, a would come towards them saying \"let's meet, let's meet (aimashou, aimashou)\" so even those who have not seen one when they are 28 years old will pretend to have seen one.\n\nAccording to one theory, \"since funerals before the war were burials, so it would be common for the phosphorus that come from the body to react to the rain water on rainy nights and produce light, and the meager knowledge about science from the masses produced the idea of hitodama.\"\n\nAnother possibility is that they come from fireflies, of which three species are common in Japan: \"Luciola cruciata\" (, \"Genji hotaru\"; meaning „Genji´s firefly“), \"Luciola lateralis\" (, \"Heike hotaru\"; meaning \"firefly from Heike\"), and \"Colophotia praeusta\". All these snail-eating beetles and their larvae are famous for their ability to make special body parts glow (bioluminescence) and make them blink rhythmically. Every year at the Fusa-park in Tokyo the legendary feast \"Hotarugari\" (; meaning \"firefly catching\") is celebrated. They have also been thought to possibly be misrecognitions of shooting stars, animals that have luminous bryophytes attached to them, gasses that come from swamps, light bulbs, or visual hallucinations. There have also been some \"artificial hitodama\" created using combustible gases (an experiment in 1976 by the Meiji University professor, Masao Yamana using methane gas).\n\nIn the 1980s, the Yoshiko Ootsuki posited the idea that they are \"plasma from the air.\"\n\nHowever, there are some hitodama that cannot be explained by the above theories, so they are thought to come from various phenomena.\n\n\n\n"}

Located on the roof of One Times Square, the ball is a prominent part of a New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square commonly referred to as the ball drop, where the ball descends in 60 seconds down a specially designed flagpole, beginning at 11:59:00 p.m. ET, and resting at midnight to signal the start of the new year. In recent years, the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment, including performances by musicians.\n\nThe event was first organized by Adolph Ochs, owner of \"The New York Times\" newspaper, as a successor to a series of New Year's Eve fireworks displays he held at the building to promote its status as the new headquarters of the \"Times\", while the ball itself was designed by Artkraft Strauss. First held on December 31, 1907, to welcome 1908, the ball drop has been held annually since, except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of wartime blackouts.\n\nThe ball's design has been updated over the years to reflect improvements in lighting technology; the ball was initially constructed from wood and iron, and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs. The current incarnation features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangular crystal panels. These panels contain inscriptions representing a yearly theme. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop One Times Square year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 has been on display inside the Times Square visitor's center.\n\nThe event is organized by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment, a company led by Jeff Strauss, and is among the most notable New Year's celebrations internationally: it is attended by at least 1 million spectators yearly, and is nationally televised as part of New Year's Eve specials broadcast by a number of networks and cable channels. The prevalence of the Times Square ball drop has inspired similar \"drops\" at other local New Year's Eve events across the country; while some use balls, some instead drop objects that represent local culture or history.\n\nTo facilitate the arrival of attendees, Times Square is closed to traffic beginning in the late afternoon on New Year's Eve. The square is then divided into different viewing sections referred to as \"pens\", into which attendees are directed sequentially upon arrival. Security is strictly enforced by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), even more so since the 2001–02 edition in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Attendees are required to pass through security checkpoints before they are assigned a pen, and are prohibited from bringing backpacks or alcohol to the event.\n\nSecurity was increased further for 2017–18 edition due to recent incidents such as the truck attack in New York on October 31, and the Route 91 Harvest festival shootings in Las Vegas; these included additional patrols of Times Square hotels, rooftop patrol squads and counter-snipers, and the installation of reflective markers on buildings to help officers identify the location of elevated shooters. For 2018–19, the NYPD announced its intent to use a camera-equipped quadcopter to augment the over 1,200 fixed cameras monitoring Times Square. However, due to the rainy conditions, the quadcopter was ultimately left unused.\n\nFestivities formally begin in the early evening, with the raising of the ball at around 6:00 p.m. ET, upon the conclusion of the 20-second “6 Hours to Go” countdown at 5:59:40. Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square.\n\nThe drop itself occurs at 11:59 p.m.—the last minute of the year, and is ceremonially \"activated\" by a dignitary or celebrity joined on-stage by the current Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio; formerly Rudy Giuliani from 1995-96 until 2001-02, and Michael Bloomberg from 2002-03 until 2012-13. The conclusion of the drop is followed by fireworks shot from the roof of One Times Square, along with the playing of \"Auld Lang Syne\" by Guy Lombardo, \"New York, New York\" by Frank Sinatra, \"America the Beautiful\" by Ray Charles, \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong, and \"Over the Rainbow\" by IZ.\n\nThe current Mayor of New York City has been joined by a special guest, selected yearly to recognize their community involvement or significance, in ceremonially \"activating\" the ball drop by pressing a button, resembling a smaller version of the ball itself, at exactly one minute to midnight. The button itself does not actually trigger the drop; that is done from a control room, synchronized using a government time signal. Special guests who have activated the ball drop have included:\n\nSince the 2005–06 edition of the event, the drop has been directly preceded by the playing of John Lennon's song \"Imagine\". Until 2009–2010, the original recording was used; since 2010–2011, the song has been performed by the headlining artist;\n\nAfter the conclusion of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square. When it is re-opened to the public the following morning, few traces of the previous night's celebration remain: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square in eight hours, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.\n\nThe first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31, 1904; \"The New York Times\"' owner, Adolph Ochs, decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, One Times Square, with a New Year's fireworks show on the roof of the building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church. However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a time ball, after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building.\n\nOchs hired sign designer Artkraft Strauss to construct a ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, electrically lit with one hundred incandescent light bulbs, weighed , and measured in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's flagpole with rope by a team of six men. Once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot tall sign indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show. The first ever \"ball drop\" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908.\n\nIn 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the \"Times\" moved its corporate headquarters to 229 West 43rd Street. The \"Times\" still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop.\n\nThe original ball was retired in 1920 in favor of a second design; the second ball remained in diameter, but was now constructed from iron, weighing . The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1942 and 1943 due to wartime lighting restrictions during World War II. Instead, a moment of silence was observed at midnight in Times Square, accompanied by the sound of church bells played from sound trucks.\n\nThe second ball was retired in favor of a third design in 1955; again, it maintained the same diameter of its predecessors, but was now constructed from aluminium, and weighed . In 1981, the ball was modified to make it resemble an apple, by switching to red lightbulbs and adding a green \"stem\". For 1988, organizers acknowledged the addition of a leap second earlier that day (leap seconds are appended at midnight UTC, which is five hours before midnight in New York) by extending the drop to 61 seconds, and by including a special one-second light show during the extra second. The original white bulbs returned to the ball for 1989, but were replaced by red, white, and blue bulbs in 1991 to salute the troops of Operation Desert Shield.\n\nThe third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a computerized lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were \"something [that] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium.\"\n\nThe drop itself became computerized through the use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.\n\nOn December 28, 1998, during a press conference attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium, and replaced by a new design constructed by Waterford Crystal. The year 2000 celebrations introduced more prominent sponsorship to the drop; companies such as Discover Card, Korbel Champagne, and Panasonic were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square. The city also announced that Ron Silver would lead a committee known as \"NYC 2000\", which was in charge of organizing events across the city for year 2000 celebrations.\n\nA full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by Michael Curry, representing countries entering the new year at that hour. Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding 2 million spectators.\n\nThe fourth ball, measuring in diameter and weighing , incorporated a total of over 600 halogen bulbs, 504 triangle-shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford, 96 strobe lights, and spinning, pyramid-shaped mirrors. The ball was constructed at Waterford's factory in Ireland, and was then shipped to New York City, where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed.\n\nMany of the triangles were inscribed with \"Hope\"-themed designs changing yearly, such as \"Hope for Fellowship\", \"Hope for Wisdom\", \"Hope for Unity\", \"Hope for Courage\", and \"Hope for Abundance\". For 2002, as part of the theme \"Hope for Healing\", 195 of the ball's panels were engraved with the names of nations and organizations who were affected by or were involved in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In December 2011, the \"Hope for Healing\" panels were accepted into the collection of the National September 11 Museum.\n\nIn honor of the ball drop's centennial anniversary, a brand new fifth design debuted for New Year's Eve 2008. Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of , but weighing , it used LED lamps provided by Philips (which can produce 16,777,216 or 2 colors), with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City-based lighting firm Focus Lighting. The ball featured 9,576 energy-efficient bulbs that consumed the same amount of electricity as only 10 toasters. The 2008 ball was only used once, and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event.\n\nFor 2009, a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced—an icosahedral geodesic sphere lit by 32,256 LED lamps. Its diameter is twice as wide as the 2008 ball, at , and contains 2,688 Waterford Crystal panels, with a weight of . It was designed to be weatherproof, as the ball would now be displayed atop One Times Square nearly year-round following the celebrations.\n\nYearly themes for the ball's crystal panels continued; from 2008 to 2013, the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as \"World of Celebration\", including themes such as \"Let There Be Light\" and \"Let There Be Peace\". For 2014, all the ball's panels were replaced, marking a new theme series known as \"Greatest Gifts\", beginning with \"Gift of Imagination\".\n\nThe numerical sign indicating the year (which remains atop the tower along with the ball itself) uses Philips LED lamps. The \"14\" digits for 2014 used Philips Hue multi-color LED lamps, allowing them to have computerized lighting cues.\n\nAccording to National Weather Service records, between the 1907–08 and 2017–18 festivities, the average temperature at midnight in nearby Central Park was . The warmest ball drops occurred in 1965–66 and 1972–73 when the temperature was . The coldest ball drop occurred in 1917–18, when the temperature was and the wind chill was . Affected by a continent-wide cold wave, the 2017–18 drop was the second-coldest on record, at ( after wind chill). Snow has fallen seven times, most recently during the 2009–10 event, and rain or drizzle has fallen sixteen times, most recently during the 2018–19 event.\n\nAs a public event, the festivities and ball drop are often broadcast on television. As of 2016-17, a host feed of 21 cameras across Times Square is provided to broadcasters to incorporate into their coverage. \n\nThe event is covered as part of New Year's Eve television specials on several major U.S. television networks. By far the most notable of these is \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\"; created, produced, and originally hosted by the entertainer Dick Clark until his death in 2012, and currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Jenny McCarthy, the program first aired on NBC in 1972 before moving to ABC, where it has been broadcast ever since. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" has consistently been the most-watched New Year's Eve special in the U.S. annually, peaking at 25.6 million viewers for its 2017-18 edition. Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012, a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute.\n\nAcross the remaining networks, NBC broadcasts \"NBC's New Years Eve\" while Fox has aired New Year's specials covering Times Square with rotating hosts and themes, which were broadcast primarily under the title \"New Year's Eve Live\" until 2014. From 2015 to 2017, Fox broadcast \"Pitbull's New Year's Revolution\" from Miami instead, but returned to a Times Square-based show hosted by Steve Harvey for 2018. Spanish-language network Univision broadcasts \"¡Feliz!\", hosted by Raúl de Molina of \"El Gordo y La Flaca\".\n\nOn cable, CNN carries coverage of the festivities, known as \"New Year's Eve Live\", currently hosted by Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen (the latter first replacing Kathy Griffin for 2018). Fox News carries \"All-American New Year\", which was most recently hosted by Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer from Times Square.\n\nSince 2008-09, an official webcast of the ball drop and its associated festivities has been produced, streamed via Livestream.com.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, NBC broadcast coverage from Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television. Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of \"The Tonight Show\", continuing through Johnny Carson and Jay Leno's tenures on the program. NBC would introduce a dedicated special, \"New Year's Eve with Carson Daly\", beginning in 2004 with Carson Daly of \"The Voice\" and \"Last Call\". That special changed its name to \"NBC's New Years Eve\" for the 2018-19 event.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1976, CBS was well known for its television coverage of the festivities hosted by bandleader Guy Lombardo, most frequently from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, featuring his band's famous rendition of \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight. After Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians, now led by Victor Lombardo, attempted to continue the special. However, Guy's absence and the growing popularity of ABC's \"New Year’s Rockin’ Eve\" prompted CBS to eventually drop the band entirely. In 1979 the Royal Canadians were replaced by a new special, \"Happy New Year, America\", which ran in various formats with different hosts (such as Paul Anka, Donny Osmond, Andy Williams, Paul Shaffer, and Montel Williams) until it was discontinued after 1996. CBS, except for coverage during a special episode of \"Late Show with David Letterman\" for 1999, and a special \"America's Millennium\" broadcast for 2000, has not broadcast any national New Year's programming since.\n\nFor 2000, in lieu of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", ABC News covered the festivities as part of its day-long telecast, \"ABC 2000 Today\". Hosted by Peter Jennings, the broadcast featured coverage of millennium festivities from around the world, including those in New York City. Jennings was joined by Dick Clark as a special correspondent for coverage from Times Square.\n\nMTV had broadcast coverage originating from the network's Times Square studios at One Astor Plaza. For 2011, MTV also held its own ball drop in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, the setting of its popular reality series \"Jersey Shore\", featuring cast member Snooki lowered inside a giant \"hamster ball\". Originally, MTV planned to hold the drop within its studio in Times Square, but the network was asked by city officials to conduct the drop elsewhere.\n"}

Derived from Chinese cuisine, Korean Chinese cuisine consists of unique dishes with Korean flavors and ingredients. Most Korean Chinese restaurants in and outside South Korea are owned and operated by Koreans rather than ethnic Chinese. In South Korea, the food is usually delivered. In the United States, only Mandarin-style Chinese restaurants are familiar with Korean Chinese cuisine, as it is a hybrid of Korean and Mandarin Chinese cuisines; Szechuan-style restaurants largely do not serve this type of cuisine.\n\nThe cuisine was first developed during the 19th century in the port city of Incheon, where most of the ethnic Chinese population of Korea lived. Due to geographic proximity and the demographics of the Korean Chinese population, most Korean Chinese dishes are derived from (or influenced by) northern, eastern and northeastern Chinese dishes from Beijing and Shandong.\n\nChinese restaurants in Korea are unusual in that most are owned and operated by Koreans, rather than ethnic Chinese. This was because the assimilation of the ethnic Chinese into Korean culture and their emigration due to legal discrimination, particularly under the Park Chung-hee administration. Consequently, the most authentic Korean Chinese cuisine may be found in overseas Korean communities. \n\nThe food is primarily delivered, comparable to pizza delivery in the US or Indian take-away in the UK, and is similarly priced relative to other dining options. Chinese dishes, also popular in South Korea, are generally served at upscale Chinese restaurants rather than Korean Chinese establishments.\n\nThree primarily-Chinese dishes are served in most Korean Chinese restaurants in South Korea and elsewhere:\n\n\nOther dishes often served in Korean Chinese restaurants include:\n\n\nDumplings are also served at Korean Chinese restaurants, usually a pan-fried cross between a Japanese gyoza and a northern-Chinese dumpling. Koreans traditionally eat Chinese food with a side dish of \"danmuji\" (yellow pickled radishes) and raw onion dipped in \"chunjang\". Kimchi, a Korean staple, is also eaten with Chinese food.

{"id": "3610868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3610868", "title": "National Bohemian", "text": "National Bohemian\n\nNational Bohemian Beer, colloquially Natty Boh, is an American beer originally brewed in Baltimore, Maryland, but now owned by the Pabst Brewing Company. First brewed in 1885 by the National Brewing Company, whose other brands were National Premium and Colt 45 malt liquor, this Bohemian-style beer's slogan had long been \"Oh boy. What a beer!\"\n\nNearly 90 percent of National Bohemian sales are in Baltimore. The beer is currently brewed under contract at the MillerCoors brewing facilities in Eden, NC, Albany, GA, Trenton, OH and is also owned by Pabst Brewing Company.\n\nFor a time, National's president Jerold Hoffberger also owned the Baltimore Orioles; Natty Boh was served at Memorial Stadium and became the \"official\" beer of Baltimore in the late 1960s. The \"Land of Pleasant Living\" slogan reached its peak during the mid-late 1960s when National acquired a Chesapeake Bay skipjack (local sailing vessel) and named it the \"Chesterpeake\" after a pelican who appeared in their ads.\nThe Chesterpeake traveled throughout the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay visiting various local festivals, regattas, yacht clubs, etc. and was also seen in television commercials.\n\nAfter a 1975 merger with Canadian brewer Carling, the Baltimore brewery located at the intersection of O'Donnell and Conkling streets was closed in 1978 and production moved to the company's facility in nearby Halethorpe. Carling-National was itself bought out by the G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1979. Heileman added Tuborg to the list of beers brewed in Halethorpe.\n\nIn 1996, Heileman was sold to Stroh Brewery Company and, eventually, to Pabst Brewing Company. Brewing stopped at the Halethorpe facility by 2000. The facility was sold to a local interest. The Halethorpe brewing facility was demolished by 2006, while the original Baltimore brewing facility was redeveloped as the Brewers Hill complex by Obrecht Commercial Real Estate, Inc.\n\nIn May 2010, Pabst Brewing was sold to C. Dean Metropoulos, a private investor, for $250 million.\n\nFor over 15 years, the famous Baltimore beer was not available on draft, only bottles and cans, but in February 2011, local taverns in the Baltimore area celebrated the ability to serve National Bohemian from a keg. National Bohemian draft also became available at Oriole Park at Camden Yards for the home season opener in 2011.\n\nThe company's mascot, the one-eyed, handlebar-mustachioed Mr. Boh, has been a recognizable icon since his introduction in 1936 by company president Arthur Deute. In an era when National Boh's main competition was another local brew Gunther Beer, whose slogan was \"Gunther's got it,\" schoolchildren would ask: \"What happened to Mr. Boh's other eye?\" Answer: \"Gunther's got it.\"\n\nAccording to Dawson Farber, who was promoted to Vice-President of marketing in 1950, he has \"no idea why he only has one eye,\" Farber confesses. \"I don't think anybody does.\" It is hinted that it could be so because Mr. Boh's head is supposed to be viewed from the side. The image was debuted in the 1930s and through Farber's modern redesign it became a \"potent brewery icon\". By the end of National’s 1960’s to mid-1970’s run as one of Baltimore’s most prominent corporate “citizens,” Mr. Boh’s image largely gave way to the “National Bohemian” name itself against a rectangular background which dipped in the middle to form a “V.” Indeed some of Boh’s popularity began to wane in 1967 when the brewer temporarily shifted its advertising slogan from “The Land of Pleasant Living” to “Every Man Should Have a Beer He Can Call His Own.”\n\nThe mascot's image is licensed for a Maryland Lottery scratch off; by Smyth Jewelers; and is the official team mascot of the Baltimore Boh's professional soccer team. A Mr. Boh neon sign currently sits atop the former site of the National Brewery building in the Brewer's Hill neighborhood of Baltimore and is clearly visible from I-95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Mr. Boh still appears on all cans, bottles, and packaging; and merchandise featuring him can still easily be found in shops in Maryland, including several in Fells Point.\nThe National line also included \"National Bohemian Dark\" and \"National Premium\", available in can, bottle and draft versions. Both were discontinued following Heileman's sale to Stroh's in 1996; however, National Premium rights were purchased and the recipe re-bottled and distributed starting in 2012 by a couple located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. National Bohemian also produces an ice beer called \"Boh Ice\" having an alcohol content of 5.8%.\n\nMr. Boh has become an icon to the city of Baltimore. Stores have been built with products featuring the character such as shirts, hats, and memorabilia in Fells Point, Canton, and other locations. The citizens of Baltimore have fought to make Mr. Boh an unofficial spokesman for the city.\n\nMr. Boh has been part of an ongoing internet meme where he can be seen in artwork and images on the internet as the husband, fiance, boyfriend, or male partner of the Utz Girl mascot of Utz Quality Foods. Like National Bohemian beer Utz Quality Foods, or Utz snacks as it is more commonly known, has historic ties to the city of Baltimore, Maryland. The meme can be traced back to a billboard in Baltimore that first appeared in 2007. The billboard was an advertisement for a local Baltimore jeweler and depicted Mr. Boh on one knee proposing to the Utz Girl with a diamond ring in his hand and the caption, \"Where Baltimore gets engaged.\" The billboard was part of a larger ad campaign which included local television commercials. In May 2014 the billboard was taken down with plans of replacing it with a permanent brick and mortar mural at another location within the city.\n\nNational Bohemian added Cap Puzzles, a series of pictograms, or rebus that create a common phrase, in 1944. The bottles with Cap Puzzles were used by United States spies to aid the allies in World War II. After the conclusion of the war Cap Puzzles remained and are now a staple of the product.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the demise of the National Brewing Company in 1978, the brewery was involved in many athletic sponsorships. Early involvements included bowling and golf tournaments held in the Baltimore metro area. During the 1950s and 1960s, National Beer sponsored the PGA Eastern Open Invitational held at the Mt Pleasant Golf Course in Baltimore. Beginning in the late 1960s, National Beer began sponsoring the National Beer Brewers softball team, composed primarily of Baltimore Clippers hockey players. From 1968 to 1985, the brewery sponsored the National Brewers ice hockey team in the Chesapeake Hockey League. Though the brand lost a great deal of local market share in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s (due mainly to the overwhelming media blitz of Anheuser-Busch) there has been a resurgence of interest in \"Natty Boh\" in recent years, particularly among younger beer drinkers.\n\nNational Bohemian has recently become the marquee sponsor of the minor league soccer team Baltimore Bohemians.\n\n"}

This staple comfort food is a signature sweet and taho peddlers can be found all over the country. The Indonesian and Thai equivalent of this snack is Tauhue, and the Malaysian equivalent of this snack is called Taufufah.\n\nThrough early records, it is evident that taho traces its origin to the Chinese douhua ().\n\nMost taho vendors prepare the separate ingredients before dawn. The main ingredient, fresh soft/silken tofu, is processed to a consistency that is very similar to a very fine custard. The brown sugar is caramelized and mixed with water to create a viscous amber-colored syrup called \"arnibal\". Flavors, like vanilla are sometimes added to the \"arnibal\". Sago pearls, purchased from the local market, are boiled to a gummy consistency until they are a translucent white. In lieu of making soft tofu from scratch, one can use a soft tofu mix from the store.\n\nThe \"Magtataho\" (\"taho\" vendor) is a common sight in the Philippine streets. A \"magtataho\" carries two large aluminum buckets that hang from each end of a carrying pole. The larger bucket carries the tofu base; the smaller bucket holds the \"arnibal\" and sago pearls.\n\nTaho vendors peddle their product in a distinctive manner, calling its name in a full, rising inflection as they walk at a leisurely pace on the sidewalk or along the side of the road. Most \"magtataho\" keep a habitual route and schedule, calling out \"\"Tahoooooo!\"\" to attract a customer's attention. Though vendors are most likely to ply their routes early in the morning, it is not uncommon for a \"magtataho\" to be spotted in the late afternoon or evening as well.\n\nMost \"magtataho\" carry plastic cups, often in two sizes, and spoons (sometimes straws) for their product. Some customers in residential areas tend to use their own cups, and the vendors price their product accordingly (The price usually costs around 20 Php for a standard-sized mug). Using a wide, shallow metal watch glass-shaped scoop, they skim the surface of the bean curd and toss out any excess water, before scooping the bean curd itself into a cup. Then, using a long, thin metal ladle, they scoop sago or tapioca pearls and \"arnibal\" into the cup, loosely mixing it in.\n\nTaho is enjoyed either with a spoon, sipping it with a straw, or by simply slurping it straight from the cup. Though traditionally served warm, cold varieties exist in supermarkets and food stalls in cafeterias with bean curd in a solid, unbroken state. These pre-packed cups, sold with a plastic spoon or wooden ice pop stick, tend to contain a firmer tofu.\n\nIn Baguio, there is also a strawberry variety of \"taho\", wherein strawberry syrup is used instead of \"arnibal\". Other varieties are white cane sugar syrup, or chocolate flavor.\n"}

Onion and garlic can also be used to intensify the dressing’s flavor. It is often bought bottled, or prepared by mixing oil and vinegar with a packaged flavoring mix consisting of dehydrated vegetables and herbs.\n\nNorth American-style Italian dressing is not used in Italy, where salad is normally dressed with olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, salt, and sometimes black pepper at the table, and not with a pre-mixed vinaigrette. Italian dressing is also used as a marinade for meat or vegetables, for stir-frys, and on sandwiches. Pasta salads sometimes include Italian dressing. The caloric content of Italian dressing varies widely. A variety of Italian dressing, known as creamy Italian, consists of the same ingredients, but with milk products and stabilizers added to make the salad dressing creamy.\n\nNorth American style Italian salad dressing is thought to date back to 1941 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Florence Hanna, the daughter of Italian immigrants and wife of restaurateur Ken Hanna, made large batches of her family's salad dressing for the house salads at the restaurant. The restaurant, originally called The '41 Cafe, later changed locations and became known as Ken's Steak House. The salad dressing became so popular that it was made in large vats in the basement of Ken's to keep up with demand. Customers started requesting the Italian dressing to go. The Crowley family, who owned a nearby manufacturing business, approached the Hanna family about bottling the popular salad dressing. This resulted in the creation of Ken's Salad Dressing, which now comes in several variations of Italian, as well as many other flavors.\n\nItalian salad dressing was also served in Kansas City, MO at the Wishbone Restaurant beginning in 1948. The Wishbone had been opened in 1945 by Phillip Sollomi along with Lena Sollomi, Phillip's mother. The Italian dressing served at the Wishbone was based on a recipe from Lena Sollomi's Sicilian family which was a blend of oil, vinegar, herbs and spices. Demand for the salad dressing proved so high that Phillip started a separate operation to produce it for sale, making it by the barrel. The dressing recipe was eventually purchased by Lipton and has been made commercially by a succession of owners since, with the product currently made by Pinnacle Foods, Inc.\n"}

It may also be called mother dough.\n\nA pre-ferment and a longer fermentation in the bread-making process have several benefits: there is more time for yeast, enzyme and, if sourdough, bacterial actions on the starch and proteins in the dough; this in turn improves the keeping time of the baked bread, and it creates greater complexities of flavor. Though pre-ferments have declined in popularity as \"direct\" additions of yeast in bread recipes have streamlined the process on a commercial level, pre-ferments of various forms are widely used in artisanal bread recipes and formulas.\n\nIn general, there are two pre-ferment varieties: sponges, based on baker's yeast, and the starters of sourdough, based on wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. There are several kinds of pre-ferment commonly named and used in bread baking. They all fall on a varying process and time spectrum, from a mature \"mother dough\" of many generations of age to a first-generation sponge based on a fresh batch of baker's yeast:\n\n\nThe common, but undocumented, origin given for the term \"poolish\" is that it was first used by Polish bakers around 1840, hence its name, and as a method was brought to France in the beginning of the 1920s. \"Poolish\" however is an old English version of \"Polish\", whereas the term seems to be most used in France (where \"polonais\" is the word for \"Polish\"). Some nineteenth-century sources use the homophone \"pouliche\", a French word that typically means a female foal. With either spelling, the term only appears in French sources towards the last part of the nineteenth century. There is not currently any credible explanation for the origin of the term.\n\nA pre-ferment is easy to make and usually consists of a simple mixture of wheat flour, water, and a leavening agent (typically yeast). Two schools of thought exist regarding the inclusion of salt or sugar. They both act to inhibit or slow yeast growth, as determined by time to proof or rise, so they are not usually included and instead are added to the final dough. Ultimately, the amounts of each ingredient, and when they are added, depend on pre-ferment and final-dough formulas.\n\nIn some countries (mainly Eastern Europe, Baltic and Nordic countries) rye flour is also used to make a starter. Traditional Finnish rye starter consists of only rye flour and water, no sugar or yeast. Some might also use yogurt to fasten the starter to rise.\n\nWhen expressed as a bakers' percentage, 50 parts of flour added to 50 parts of water or 1-to-1 is 100% hydration, and results in a relatively fluid pre-ferment. Stiffer doughs such as 50% hydration or 2-to-1, may also be used. After mixing it is allowed to ferment for a period of time, and then is added to the final dough as a substitute for or in addition to more yeast. There are distinctly different \"brew\" types of pre-ferments designed for computer-controlled bakeries that use a rather different series of ingredients, including oxidizers, needed for continuous dough-production processes.\n\nFermentation is sometimes performed in a warm place, or a humidity- and temperature-controlled environment. Cooler-than-room or refrigeration temperatures decelerate growth and increase the time interval, while slightly warmer temperatures accelerate growth and decrease the time interval. Too warm of a temperature slows growth, while even higher temperatures will kill the yeast. Death of the yeast cells occur in the range of . When cooling a levain or sourdough pre-ferment, if the dough temperature drops below it affects the culture and leads to the loss of a particular aroma in the baked bread.\n\nTo allow room for the pre-ferment to rise, the ingredients are mixed in a container at least four or five times their volume. This is about the point in time when some process similarities of yeast pre-ferments to sourdough or levain starters begins to diverge. The typical amounts of time allotted for the yeast pre-ferment period may range from 2–16 hours, depending on the dough's temperature and the added amount of viable yeast, often expressed as a bakers' percentage. Spontaneous sourdough starters take, at a minimum, several days, and are subject to many variables.\n\nTo make a sourdough starter from scratch, the minimum-needed ingredients are flour, water, and time. This starter is maintained with daily feedings or refreshments of fresh flour and water or, new dough. It ferments at room temperature until the desired age or minimal number of refreshments, following a refreshment schedule that may include acceleration of time intervals leading into the final dough, then is added to the final dough. When maintaining a starter's existing weight, it is advised to discard 60% (or more) of the starter, replacing that discarded dough with new dough. If an increased amount of starter is required, simply add new dough. 40-parts-to-60-parts of old-dough-to-new-dough by weight, or 2-to-3, is known as the back-slopping ratio, and changes to that ratio change the pH of the just-refreshed dough. To make a \"primary-culture levain\", Raymond Calvel used salt, but less of it than would be typical for many final-dough formulas.\n\n"}

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, the company maintains plants and distributors in the United States. Dean Foods has 66 manufacturing facilities in 32 U.S. states and distributes its products across all 50. The company's 58 brands include DairyPure, TruMoo, Friendly's, Mayfield, Dean's, Meadow Gold, Tuscan and Alta Dena.\n\nDean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean, Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s. After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise \"from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company\".\nIn December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name. As part of the merger, 11 plants were divested under the name National Dairy to a group led by Dairy Farmers of America. In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. In June 2005, TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.\n\nIn March 2005, the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating \"organic livestock management\" standards.\n\nIn August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan. Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007. In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa. Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a \"global leader in soy beverages\". This resulted in a restructuring of the company that included selling off a number of subsidiaries, including Rachel's Organic.\n\nOn May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.\n\nSilk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging, prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.\n\nForemost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009. In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorneys general's office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider. Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas. In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.\n\nIn 2011, a class action suit was brought against Deans Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk. In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.\n\nDean Foods spun off WhiteWave Foods, the maker of Horizon Organic and Silk Soymilk, as a standalone company in May 2013.\n\nIn May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would eliminate regional brands for its milk in favor of a single brand, DairyPure, which was already being used as a sub-brand under its previous regional marketing scheme.\n\nIn 2017, bettor and stock trader Billy Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court.

Although American, persimmon pudding is similar to traditional English dessert puddings, such as Christmas pudding (raisin or fig) or quince pudding. This style of pudding is generally either steamed or cooked in an oven with a water bath (also called a bain-marie). These methods of cooking ensure the pudding remains moist and does not dry out or form a crust unlike the sweet but crusted persimmon bread.\n\nThe pudding is often served with ice cream, crème anglaise, whipped cream, apple sauce, or hard sauce, which is sometimes called brandy sauce. It is traditionally served warm, though it can be served cold as well. Persimmon pudding lasts quite a while when refrigerated, and may be made in large batches to be served over the course of several days. As the pudding ages the various individual flavors mellow and blend.\n\nIn the U.S. state of Indiana, it is considered one of two legendary local dishes; the other being sugar cream pie.\n\n\n"}

The meringues are prepared from whipped egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract then quickly poached. The crème anglaise is prepared with the egg yolks, vanilla, and hot milk, briefly cooked.\n\nThere is some confusion about the name. In French cuisine, the terms œufs à la neige (\"eggs in snow\") and île flottante (floating island) are sometimes used interchangeably; the latter is the source of the English name. The difference between the two dishes is that \"île flottante\" sometimes contains islands made of \"alternate layers of alcohol-soaked dessert biscuits and jam.\"\n\nFloating island consists of a meringue served floating on a milky custard sauce. Some variations use a thicker sauce, served on top of the dumplings, but usually the milk mix is thin, almost liquid, and the dumplings \"float\" on top.\n\nThe egg whites are beaten with sugar and poured into a mould lined with a thin layer of caramel. Alternately, the whites can be shaped with spoons and allowed to cook gently in sweetened milk with vanilla flavoring. A custard is made using milk, sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks; the mix is cooked in a bain-marie for a few minutes, but must remain thin enough to pour. The custard is topped with the egg whites dumplings. The dish is served at room temperature or cold.\n\nAnother variant is to make the meringue in a fluted cake tin, where sugar is caramelised in the bottom of the cake tin, then the meringue is added and steamed in a water bath in the oven. This is then placed in a container and the custard is poured into the middle, which makes the \"island\" float.\n\nIn the 1957 movie \"Desk Set\", Katharine Hepburn's character Bunny Watson served Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy) floating island dessert.\n\nIn Jack London's story, The Apostate, floating island is a dish that holds a near-mythical ideal to the working class lead character.\n\nIn the Nancy Drew mystery story \"The Hidden Staircase\", floating island is served at Twin Elms. \n\nIn , floating island is one of Myrtle Snow's favorite desserts after key lime pie.\n\n\n"}

Soft serve ice cream has been sold commercially since the late 1930s in the US.\n\nIn the US, soft serve ice cream is not sold prepackaged in supermarkets, but is common at fairs, carnivals, amusement parks, restaurants (especially fast food and buffet), and specialty shops. All ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystallization. With soft serve, this is accomplished by a special machine that holds pre-mixed product at a very low, but non-frozen temperature, at the point of sale.\n\nOver Memorial Day weekend of 1934, Tom Carvel, the founder of the Carvel brand and franchise, suffered a flat tire in his ice cream truck in Hartsdale, New York. He pulled into a parking lot and began selling his melting ice cream to vacationers driving by. Within two days he had sold his entire supply of ice cream and concluded that both a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were potentially good business ideas. In 1936, Carvel opened his first store on the original broken down truck site and developed a secret soft serve ice cream formula as well as patented super low temperature ice cream machines.\n\nDairy Queen also claims to have invented soft serve. In 1938, near Moline, Illinois, J. F. McCullough and his son, Alex, developed their soft serve formula. Their first sales experiment was August 4, 1938, in Kankakee, Illinois at the store of their friend, Sherb Noble. Within two hours of the \"all you can eat\" trial sale, they had dished out more than 1,600 servings — more than one every 4.5 seconds.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, future UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked briefly as a chemist for food manufacturer J. Lyons and Co., at a time when the company had partnered with the United States distributor Mister Softee and was developing a soft-serve recipe that was compatible with the American machines. Thatcher's precise role at Lyons is unclear, but she is reported to have worked on the company's ice cream products, as well as cakes and pies. A common anecdote, probably spread by her political opponents, is that by \"inventing\" soft serve ice cream, Thatcher \"added air, lowered quality and raised profits\", used as a metaphor for her policies later as prime minister.\n\nIn the 1960s, ice cream machine manufacturers introduced mechanized air pumps into vending machines, providing better aeration.\n\nSoft serve is generally lower in milk-fat (3% to 6%) than ice cream (10% to 18%) and is produced at a temperature of about −4 °C compared to ice cream, which is stored at −15 °C. Soft serve contains air, introduced at the time of freezing. The air content, called \"overrun\", can vary from 0% to 60% of the total volume of finished product. The amount of air alters the taste of the finished product. Product with low quantities of air has a heavy, icy taste and appears more yellow. Product with higher air content tastes creamier, smoother and lighter and appears whiter. The optimum quantity of air is determined by the other ingredients and individual taste. It is generally accepted that the ideal air content should be between 33% and 45% of volume. More than this and the product loses taste, tends to shrink as it loses air and melts more quickly than that with less air.\n\nSome forms of soft serve, like many other processed foods, have palm oil.\n\nAll ice cream must be frozen quickly to avoid crystallization. With soft serve, this is accomplished by a special machine at the point of sale. Pre-mixed product (see definitions below) is introduced to the storage chamber of the machine where it is kept at 3 °C. When product is drawn from the draw valve, fresh mix combined with the targeted quantity of air is introduced to the freezing chamber either by gravity or pump. It is then churned and quick frozen and stored until required.\n\nWhile some machines only dispense one flavor of mix at a time, certain models of soft serve machines have an additional nozzle that dispenses a mixture of two separate flavors simultaneously. This mixture emerges in a distinct swirl pattern. It is classified as its own separate flavor on menus as \"twist\" or \"swirl\".\n\nPre-mix can be obtained in several forms:\n\n\nVarious linguistic communities use various terms to refer to soft-serve ice cream:\n\n\n"}

The blend of spices and molasses, rolled paper thin, has a reputation as the \"World's Thinnest Cookie.\" They are related to German Lebkuchen; original recipes can be traced back to the 18th century.\n\nThe cookie is especially popular around, and usually associated with, Christmas in communities with a strong Moravian background such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which still maintain the two largest Moravian communities in the United States. Traditionally, prominent homes in the community hosted open houses which contained elaborate Nativity scenes. These scenes were often built around large tree stumps which were found in the woods near the town. People opened their homes for viewings of these scenes, and offering cookies to guests was an important part of the tradition. The spice cookies were central to the occasion, but many families also made a sugar cookie which was made with butter and flavored heavily with nutmeg. Families made their own cookie cutters and handed them down to family members. The shapes were primarily farm animals, as part of the Nativity tradition. Families often had a few cookie cutters which were large and intricate and took real skill to cut out and bake. Although there are a few bakeries that still roll and cut the cookies by hand, some now use a mechanized process for making the cookies in order to meet the demand. While this does not affect the taste, the machine-made cookies have been criticized for not being as thin as their handmade counterparts.\n\nWhile the spice recipe is the most traditional and well-known of the Moravian cookies, other versions have appeared over the years, including sugar, lemon, black walnut, and chocolate varieties. \n"}

It is a thick porridge made from \"korkot\" (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich meat, usually chicken or lamb. Herbs were substituted for meat in \"harissa\" when Armenian religious days required fasting and penance. The extremely long cooking process is an essential part of the \"harissa\" tradition. Like other ritual dishes, the time taken for preparation is part of its cherished value.\n\nHarissa came from the word Harees () is derived from the verb () which means to mash or to squash.\nThe dish has been passed on since ancient times. Stories differ as to the origins of the dish. According to Armenian lore, the patron saint of Armenia, Gregory the Illuminator, was offering a meal of love and charity to the poor. There weren't enough sheep to feed the crowds so wheat was added to the cooking pots. They noticed that the wheat was sticking to the bottom of the cauldrons. Saint Gregory advised, \"\"Harekh!\" Stir it!\" Thus, the name of the dish, \"harissa\", came from the saint's own words. \"Harissa\" has been offered as a charity meal ever since. The dish is traditionally served on Easter day. It is still prepared by many Armenians around the world and is also considered the national dish of Armenia.\n\nHarissa is known for helping the Armenians of Musa Ler to survive during the resistance of 1915.\n\nHarissa is also very common in Lebanese villages, across its different ethnic communities, where it is usually cooked on religious occasions in a big pot in a village gathering. Additionally, Harissa is used by the Assyrians as a dish on \"Eeda Zoora,\" Christmas, and \"Eeda Gura,\" Easter. Harissa is very similar to a popular dish among Arab countries of the Persian Gulf known as harees which is made of meat and finely ground wheat.\n\nHarise is also a common dish in Iraqi cuisine.\n\nHarissa is very famous in Kashmir and it is prepared during winter.\n\nIt is similar to kashkeg, a kind of homogeneous porridge made of previously stewed and boned chicken or lamb and coarsely ground soaked wheat (typically shelled wheat).\n"}

The dish is of Teochew origin and is commonly served in a number of countries such as Chaoshan (China), Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. \"Mee pok\" is commonly served tossed in a sauce (often referred to as \"dry\", or \"tah\" in Hokkien ()), though sometimes served in a soup (where it is referred to as \"soup\", or \"terng\"). Meat and vegetables are added on top.\n\n\"Mee pok\" can be categorised into two variants, fish ball \"mee pok\" (\"yu wan mee pok\"), and mushroom minced meat \"mee pok\" (\"bak chor mee\"). \"Bak chor mee\" is usually exclusively prepared using thin noodles (\"mee kia\"), while \"yu wan mee\" can be cooked with other noodle varieties.\n\n\"Mee pok\" is a staple commonly offered in hawker centres and coffee shops (Kopitiams in parts of Southeast Asia) in Singapore, together with other Chinese noodle dishes.\n\nThe sauce in which the noodles are tossed in is a very important aspect of the dish, and is considered a representation of the cook's skill and experience. The importance of the sauce in \"mee pok\" can be thought of similarly as the sauces that accompany pasta.\n\nThe sauce consists of 4 components: chili, oil, vinegar and other condiments such as soy sauce and pepper. The chili is made from various ingredients and its preparation often includes frying and blending. Oil, traditionally lard, ensures a smooth texture in the noodles, although vegetable oil is sometimes used as a healthier though less tasty version. Vinegar is added for its sourness, and diners may specify how much vinegar is used.\n\nThe chili sauce may be replaced with tomato ketchup for children and others who are uncomfortable with the spiciness of the chili.\n\nSoup is served in a bowl as a side dish accompanying the \"dry\" variant, or served together with the noodles for the \"soup\" version where the sauce is omitted. Traditionally, the soup is boiled and simmered overnight with old hen, pork bones, dried sole fish and soybean. The resulting broth is rich in taste and cloudy in appearance.\n\nUsually, the noodles are factory-made, and requires substantial preparation before cooking. Different hawkers prepare and cook their noodles differently, but the desired outcome is the same: springy al dente noodles.\n\nHawkers often toss the noodles vigorously to remove excess flour and soda and to separate noodles which have stuck together. Other processes include stretching the noodles, cutting into a desired length, and separating into serving portions.\n\nThe cooking process of the noodles consists of blanching in hot and cold water multiple times, though some hawkers omit the cold water. The noodles are drained and placed in either sauce or broth.\n\n\"Bak chor mee\", which translates to minced meat noodles, is a Singaporean noodle dish popularly sold as street food in hawker centers and food courts. The noodles are tossed in vinegar, minced meat, pork slices, pork liver, stewed sliced mushrooms, meat balls and bits of deep-fried lard. \"Bak chor mee\" can be categorised into two variants: a dry version and a soup version. Most dry versions come with slices of stewed mushroom, minced pork, slices of lean pork and sometimes fried ikan bilis, atop noodles tossed in a punchy chilli-vinegar sauce, while soup versions are lauded for the depth of pork flavour in its broth. Singapore's \"bak chor mee\" was listed as the top world street food by World Street Food Congress. \n\nThis version of \"mee pok\" is usually served with toppings of fish balls, sliced fish cakes, \"geow\" (a type of small dumpling made with fish meat paste wrapping a small bit of minced meat), minced meat, meat balls, lettuce or \"taugeh\" (beansprouts in Hokkien). Requests can be made to add or omit any of the above toppings, to prepare it in soup or \"dry\" style, and with or without the chili sauce.\n\nNewer varieties of toppings include deep fried dumplings, abalone slices, imitation crab stick, and other processed fish products.\n\n\n"}

It is usually eaten for breakfast, especially during the Christmas season. It is traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with leaves. It is a subtype of \"kakanin\" (rice cakes) in Philippine cuisine. \"Bibingka\" is also found in Christian communities in eastern Indonesia.\n\nThe original method of preparing the glutinous rice used in \"bibingka\" is known as \"galapong\" (commonly incorrectly translated as \"rice flour\"). It is an ancient tradition unique to the Philippines and related Austronesian regions. It is essential for most Philippine rice desserts. Unlike other Asian cuisines, the rice isn't prepared dry. Rather it is soaked overnight in \"tapayan\" jars and are usually allowed to ferment by the addition of wild yeast called \"bubod\" or with \"tuba\" palm wine. The rice is then ground into a thick paste using stone mills before being cooked. This gives a characteristically slightly sour aftertaste in Filipino traditional rice cakes. The same process (\"tapay\") when extended for longer periods result in traditional rice vinegars and rice wines.\n\n\"Bibingka\" is a general term for baked \"galapong\"-based cakes, similar to how \"puto\" is the general term for steamed \"galapong\"-based. In recent times, it has extended its meaning to other native cakes made with other types of flour like corn flour, cassava flour, or plain flour, though these are usually considered separate dishes altogether.\n\nThe shared origins of \"bibingka\" from the Philippines and Indonesia is widely acknowledged. Especially given that the Indonesian \"bibingka\" is from Eastern Indonesia, the regions closest to the Philippines with the most closely related cultures.\n\nSome authors have also proposed a connection between the Goan dessert \"bebinca\" (or \"bibik\") and the Southeast Asian \"bibingka\" due to the similarity in names. They believe that the Portuguese may have introduced it to Southeast Asia from Goa. But this is unlikely, given that the Philippines, where \"bibingka\" is most widely known, was never a colony of Portugal. They are also very different; the Goan dessert is a type of layered coconut pudding (similar to Filipino \"sapin-sapin\" and Indonesian \"kue lapis\"), while \"bibingka\" is a simple baked glutinous rice cake. The only similarity is that \"bebinca\" and \"bibingka\" both use coconut milk. Rice-based dishes are also far more diverse in Southeast Asia, where rice is an ancient Austronesian staple crop. Thus it is more likely that the Portuguese introduced the term to Goa from the Philippines, rather than the other way around. Similar to how the art of windowpane oyster shell windows were also introduced from the Philippines to Goa (they are still called \"capiz\" in Goa after the Philippine province of Capiz).\n\n\"Bibingka\" is a traditional Philippine Christmas food. It is usually eaten along with \"puto bumbóng\" right after the \"Simbang Gabi\" ('Night mass', the Filipino version of \"Misa de Gallo\"). They are sold outside of churches during the nine-day novena for worshippers to eat for breakfast.\n\nAs of October 9, 2007, the town of Dingras, Ilocos Norte in the Philippines is expecting a Guinness World Records certification after baking a kilometer-long cassava \"bibingka\" made from 1,000 kilos of cassava and eaten by 1,000 residents. Also, in the municipality of Baliuag, Bulacan, bibingka is served along with salabat (ginger tisane) and the stores selling them serve them for free.\n\n\"Bibingka\" is traditionally made with \"galapóng\" (slightly fermented soaked glutinous rice ground into a paste) and coconut milk or water. Modern versions sometimes use regular rice flour or Japanese \"mochiko\" flour. Other ingredients can vary greatly, but the most common secondary ingredients are eggs and milk. The traditional preparation is very time-consuming. A specially made terra cotta container is lined with a single large section of a banana leaf. It is placed over preheated coals and the rice flour and water mixture is poured into it, taking care not to spill it into the container itself. Another piece of banana leaf is added to the top and covered with more preheated coals.\n\nThe end result is a soft and spongy large flat cake that is slightly charred on both surfaces and infused with the unique aroma of toasted banana leaves. Toppings are then added, usually consisting of butter/margarine, sugar, cheese, or grated coconut. Other more uncommon toppings include \"pinipig\" (pounded immature rice grains), pineapple, and salted duck eggs. A mixture of two or more of these toppings on a single \"bibingka\" are also common. \"Bibingka\" with sumptuous amounts of toppings (and ingredients) are sometimes called \"bibingka especial\".\n\nMore modern methods involve \"bibingka\" being baked in an actual oven inside a \"caldero\" or ordinary cake pans. The result lacks the distinctive smoky smell of charcoal but is otherwise the same, especially if banana leaves are also used to line it. Mass-produced \"bibingka\" in Philippine bakeries are also made using characteristic tin molds that give them a crenelated shape similar to large \"puto\" or \"puto mamon\" (cupcakes).\n\n\"Bibingka\" is best served hot. Large \"bibingka\" can be sliced (or torn) into several wedges and can serve 4 to 6 people.\n\n\"Bibingka\" has a soft spongy texture similar to \"puto\", another Philippine rice cake. It is eaten hot or warm and is slightly sweet with a taste very similar to rice pudding. The top and bottom surfaces (including the traditional banana leaf lining) are also usually charred, adding to the flavor.\n\n\"Bibingka\" is also used as a general term for desserts made with flour and baked in the same manner. The term can be loosely translated to \"[rice] cake\". It originally referred primarily to \"bibingka galapong\", the most common type of \"bibingka\" made with rice flour. Other native Philippine cakes have also sometimes been called \"bibingka\". These may use other kinds of flour, such as corn flour, cassava flour, or plain flour, and are usually considered separate dishes altogether. \"Bibingka\" can also be made with uncommon ingredients, including chocolate.\n\nMost varieties of \"bibingka\" differ only from the type of toppings they use. The common types of \"bibingka\" are listed below:\n\n\n\"Bibingka\" or \"bingka\" is also popular in Indonesia, particularly among Christian-majority areas in northern Sulawesi and the Maluku Islands, both of which were former colonies of the Portuguese Empire and are geographically close to the southern Philippines. It is prepared almost identically to Philippine \"bibingka\". In the provinces of North Sulawesi and Gorontalo, \"bibingka\" is usually made with rice or cassava flour and coconut milk with shredded coconut baked inside. In the Maluku Islands, \"bibingka\" is spiced and sweetened with brown sugar or sweet meat floss. It is also traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with banana, pandan, or nipa leaves. As in the Philippines, it is also usually eaten during the Christmas season.\n\nA pancake-like variant of \"bibingka\" was introduced to the Chinese Indonesian communities of East Java during the Dutch colonial period. Known as \"wingko\", \"wiwingka\", or \"bibika\", it became popular throughout the island of Java.\n\n"}
{"id": "3670262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3670262", "title": "Tteok", "text": "Tteok\n\nTteok () is a class of Korean rice cakes made with steamed flour made of various grains, including glutinous or non-glutinous rice. Steamed flour can also be pounded, shaped, or pan-fried to make \"tteok\". In some case, \"tteok\" is pounded from cooked grains. The pronunciation is between a \"t\" and a \"d\" sound, ending with -ukk. It could also be written as ttukk, ddukk, dhukk.\n\n\"Tteok\" has been enjoyed not only as desserts or seasonal delicacies, but also as meal. It can range from elaborated versions made of various colors, fragrances, and shapes using nuts, fruits, flowers, and namuls, to plain white rice \"tteok\" used in home cooking. Some common ingredients for many kinds of \"tteok\" are red bean, soybean, mung bean, mugwort, pumpkin, chestnut, pine nut, jujube, dried fruits, sesame seeds and oil, and honey.\n\n\"Tteok\" is usually a food that is shared. \"Tteok\" offered to spirits are called \"boktteok\" (\"good fortune rice cake\") and shared with neighbours and relatives. It is also one of the celebratory foods in banquets, rites, and various festive events. \"Tteokguk\" (\"rice cake soup\") was shared to celebrate new year and \"songpyeon\" was shared on harvest festival.\n\nThe below are cooking utensils to make \"tteok\" in the traditional Korean way.\n\n\"Tteok\" is largely divided into four categories, such as \"\"steamed tteok\"\" (찌는 떡), \"\"pounded tteok\"\" (치는 떡), \"\"boiled tteok\"\" (삶는 떡) and \"\"pan-fried tteok\"\" (지지는 떡). The steamed tteok is made by steaming rice or glutinous rice flour in \"\"siru\"\" (시루), or a large earthenware steamer, so it is often called \"\"sirutteok\"\" (시루떡). It is regarded as the basic and oldest form of \"tteok\". The pounded \"tteok\" is made by using a pounding board or mortar after steamed first. In making pan-fried tteok, the rice dough is flattened like a pancake and pan-fried with vegetable oil. The shaped \"tteok\" are made by kneading a dough with hot water which is usually shaped into balls.\n\nThe main ingredients for steamed \"tteok\" or \"\"sirutteok\"\" are rice (맵쌀, \"maepssal\" in Korean) or glutinous rice (찹쌀 \"chapssal\") and sometimes they are mixed together. In some cases, other grains, beans (azuki beans or mung beans), sesame seeds, wheat flour, or starch can be mixed with the rice. Various fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients, such as persimmons, peaches or apricots, chestnuts, walnuts, and pine nuts. In addition, vegetables with flavors or herbs can be used to flavor the \"tteok\". \"Danggwi\" leaves (\"Ostericum grosseserratum\"), \"seogi\" mushroom (manna lichen), radish, artemisia, pepper, and \"cheongju\" are the most common flavorings, and honey and sugar are used as sweeteners.\n\nIn order to make steamed \"tteok\" or \"sirutteok\", rice or glutinous rice is soaked in water for a while, then ground. The prepared rice flour is put in a \"siru\" and steamed. According to steaming method, \"sirutteok\" is subdivided into two groups; \"seolgitteok\" (설기떡) is shaped into a single large lump whereas \"kyeotteok\" (켜떡) consists of multiple layers with azuki bean powder or other bean powder. \"Seolgitteok\" is also called \"muritteok\" (무리떡), regarded as the most basic form of \"sirutteok\" made only with rice. On the hand, in making \"kyeotteok\", rice and glutinous rice are mixed. The name of \"kyeotteok\" derives from the adverb \"kyeokeyo\" (켜켜, literally \"filed\") in Korean because the \"tteok\" is made as such.\n\n\nIn the traditional preparation, pounded \"tteok\" is made by pounding rice or glutinous rice with utensils called \"jeolgu\" and \"jeolgutgongi\" or \"tteokme\" and \"anban\". \"Injeolmi\" (\"tteok\" coated with azuki / red bean powder or roasted soybean powder), \"garaetteok\" (가래떡 cylinder-shaped white tteok), \"jeolpyeon\" (절편 patterned tteok) and \"danja\" (단자 glutinous tteok ball coated with bean paste)” are commonly eaten pounded \"tteok\".\n\nRice and glutinous rice are peeled off to make grain particles or powder, and steamed in a \"siru\" (earthenware steamer) and then pounded with the untensils. The pounded tteok is divided into glutinous pounded tteok (찹쌀도병 \"chapssal dobyeong\") and non-glutinous pounded \"tteok\" (맵쌀도병 \"mapssal dobyeong\") by rice type. \"Injeolmi\" that is a representative of the glutinous pounded tteok has varieties in accordance with \"gomul\" types (고물, coating made with bean powder, sesame seeds, or sliced jujubes) or subsidiary ingredients mixed into the steamed rice while pounding on the \"anban\". \"Patinjeolmi\" (팥인절미), and \"kkaeinjeolmi\" (깨인절미) are the examples for the former, coated with red bean powder and sesame respectively. In \"ssuk injeolmi\" (쑥인절미) and \"surichwi injeolmi\" (수리취인절미) are \"ssuk\" (Artemisia princeps var. orientalis) and \"surichwi\" (\"Synurus deltoides\" (AIT.) NAKAI) added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It may be served hot or cold in a bowl, and may be made in a variety of ways. It may be smooth in texture, and there are also recipes which include chunks (or small pieces) of tomato, cream and chicken/vegetable stock. Popular toppings for tomato soup include sour cream or croutons. Tomato soup is one of the top comfort foods in Poland and the United States. It can be made fresh by blanching tomatoes, removing the skins, then blending into a puree.\n\nThe first published tomato soup is mentioned by Eliza Leslie in 1857 in her final publication \"New Cookery Book\". Joseph A. Campbell's recipe for condensed tomato soup in 1897 further increased its popularity.\n\nCommercially prepared tomato is available in a variety of forms, including canned, condensed and in dehydrated powder form. \"Tomato\" ranks among the top three flavors of soup produced by the Campbell Soup Company.\n\nCanned tomato soup is primarily tomato puree: that is, tomato paste and water with a few other ingredients added to enhance flavor and physical properties of the food. The tomato is a high acid food therefore, \"the tomato is not considered a high-risk food, as the pH of the fruit generally ranges from pH 4.2–4.9 with an average of about 4.5. At this point pathogens are unlikely to grow\". However, there are still some foodborne pathogens that can pose as a major problem when it comes to the safety of the food and its shelf life stability. The main concern when canning is anaerobic microorganisms that produce toxins like \"Clostridium botulinum\". Even though the tomato is a high acid food it still falls in the range where this organism can grow and produce toxin pH 4.6–8.5 with an optimum growing temperature between 30–40°C and a maximum temperature of 50°C. Even if the bacteria are killed they release heat resistant spores that if they start to multiply become a threat.\n\nMain ingredients on the back of the can: Tomato puree, High fructose corn syrup, wheat flour:\n\nThe cell wall structural importance for the plant's growth and stability in the ripening process is equally as important to the quality of the tomato products it can produce. The pectin and cellulose are what determine the apparent viscosity of the tomato product. If they are broken at higher temperatures more enzymes are deactivated than if they are broken at lower temperatures.\nHigh fructose corn syrup is sometimes added to tomato soup to make it sweeter. HFCS is composed of both glucose and fructose in their free monosaccharide from that doesn't crystallize readily. HFCS is also important in binding water, the monosaccharaides of fructose and glucose have the ability to bind to water in the product. The binding of water helps to reduce microbial growth by removing available water from the product it can also prevent the separation of water in products like sauces and soups.\n\nWheat flour is composed of six main groups, carbohydrates, proteins, enzymes, lipids, minerals and vitamins. Flour is added to tomato soup to increase its viscosity. The starch in the flour acts as a gelling agent and increases the viscosity of the product. When starch granules found in the flour are heated in solution they become less ordered and begin to gel. During this process of gelatinization the crystal like structures of the starch granules disappear and the swelling starts creating a viscoelastic product.\n\nGazpacho is a tomato soup of Spanish origin, served cold. It originates in the region of Andalucía in southern Spain. Gazpacho is widely consumed in Spanish cuisine, as well as in neighboring Portugal, where it is known as \"gaspacho\". Gazpacho is mostly consumed during the summer months, due to its refreshing qualities and cold serving temperature. Many variations of gazpacho exist.\n\nTomato soup is often paired with a grilled cheese sandwich, toast, crumpet or English muffin.\n\n\n"}

British coffee cake is a sponge flavoured with coffee. They are generally round and consist of two layers separated by coffee flavoured butter icing, which also covers the top of the cake. Walnuts are a common addition to coffee cakes. In the United States, coffee cake generally refers to a sweet cake intended to be eaten with coffee or tea (like tea cake). \n\nCoffee cakes, as an accompaniment for coffee, are often single layer, flavored with either fruit or cinnamon, and leavened with either baking soda (or baking powder), which results in a more cake-like texture, or yeast, which results in a more bread-like texture. Sour cream is used in traditional American coffee cakes to both impart a tart flavor and activate baking soda used as a leavening agent.\n\nCoffee cake, which can also be known as gugelhupf or kuchen, evolved from other sweet items. In the 17th century, Northern/Central Europeans are thought to have come up with the idea of eating sweet cakes while having their coffee. Because the countries in the area were already known for their sweet yeast breads, the introduction of coffee in Europe led it to be known that they were a great compliment to the beverage. Immigrants from countries such as Germany and Scandinavia had adjusted their recipes to their likings and brought them along with them to America. Though the cakes varied, they all contained ingredients such as yeast, flour, dried fruit, and sweet spices. However, over time, the coffee cake recipes changed as cheese, sugared fruit, yogurt, sour cream, began to be used. This is a result of the vast use of pasteurization in America following World War I, which also led to a new type of coffee cake to be created. This was called sour cream coffee cake.\n\nA variety of crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) which contains flour, sugar, butter and cinnamon granules on top.\n\nApplesauce cake is sometimes prepared and served as a coffee cake.\n\nIn Hungary, there is a type of coffee cake called \"arany galuska\" containing walnuts and cinnamon.\n\n"}

It is also known as biscocho duro, machacao, or matsakaw.\n\nThe term \"biscocho\" is derived from Spanish \"bizcocho\". However, they are not the same pastries. The original Spanish \"bizcocho\" refers to a type of sponge cake known as \"broas\" in the Philippines. The crunchy twice-baked and sugar-coated Philippine \"biscocho\" (more properly \"biscocho duro\"), does not exist in Spanish cuisine. There are multiple claims of people who \"invented\" the \"biscocho\" in the Philippines, usually varying depending on the region.\n\nThere are several types of \"biscochos\" from various parts of the Philippines. All of them are usually referred to as \"\"biscocho\"\" colloquially, which can be confusing. A common characteristic of \"biscocho\" is that they are typically stale bread that are baked a second time. They include:\n\n\"Biscocho de caña\" is the most well-known variant of \"biscocho\". It is a specialty of the Western Visayas islands, particularly the province of Iloilo. They are pieces of stale bread with a small amount of sugar (and no butter) that is then baked to achieve a crunchy texture. The breads used can range from flat sliced breads to sliced pieces of \"pan de monja\" (\"monay\").\n\n\"Biscocho de Manila\" originates from Manila. It is characteristically small and round and dusted with white sugar.\n\n\"Biscocho de rosca\", more commonly known as \"rosca\", is technically a cookie, and not a type of \"biscocho\". It is from the towns of Barugo and Carigara of the island of Leyte. It is made with lard, anise, flour, sugar, butter, and eggs.\n\n\"Biscocho de sebo\", also known as \"corbata de sebo\", is a bow tie-shaped \"biscocho\" from Malolos, Bulacan. It is characteristically made with lard and thus has an oily teture. It is only minimally sweetened.\n\n\"Biscocho principe\", also spelled \"biscocho prinsipe\", is another type of \"biscocho\" from Iloilo. It is similar to \"biscocho de caña\" but uses butter and more sugar. It can use any type of bread, but usually uses slices of stale \"ensaymada\", as it is already slathered in butter.\n\nGarlic \"biscocho\" is a variant of \"biscocho principe\" that is topped with butter and garlic (instead of sugar).\n\n\"Kinihad\" literally means \"sliced\", from Hiligaynon \"kihad\" (\"to slice\"). It refers to plain thinly sliced bread (without butter or sugar) that is baked to a crunchy texture. It originates from the Ilonggo regions of the Western Visayas.\n\n\"Pasuiquin biscocho\" is named after the town of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte from where it originates. \"Pasuiquin biscocho\" is shaped like small rolls. It comes in soft and crunchy versions. It does not use butter or sugar, instead it is flavored with anise or anise liqueur, giving it a tangy and slightly salty taste.\n\n"}

This specialty requires a medical residency.\n\nThe American Board of Pathology certifies clinical pathologists, and recognizes the following secondary specialties of clinical pathology:\n\n\nIn some countries other sub specialities fall under certified Clinical Biologists responsibility:\n\nClinical pathologists are often medical doctors.\nIn some countries in South-America, Europe, Africa or Asia, this specialty can be practiced by non-physicians, such as Ph.D or Pharm.D after a variable number of years of residency.\n\nClinical pathologists work in close collaboration with clinical scientists (clinical biochemists, clinical microbiologists, etc.), medical technologists, hospital administrators, and referring physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing.\n\nClinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology, the other being anatomical pathology. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination sometimes known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology.\n\nClinical pathology is itself divided into subspecialties, the main ones being clinical chemistry, clinical hematology/blood banking, hematopathology and clinical microbiology and emerging subspecialties such as molecular diagnostics and proteomics. Many areas of clinical pathology overlap with anatomic pathology. Both can serve as medical directors of CLIA certified laboratories. Under the CLIA law, only the US Department of Health and Human Services approved Board Certified Ph.D., D Sc, or MD and DO can perform the duties of a Medical or Clinical Laboratory Director. This overlap includes immunoassays, flow cytometry, microbiology and cytogenetics and any assay done on tissue. Overlap between anatomic and clinical pathology is expanding to molecular diagnostics and proteomics as we move towards making the best use of new technologies for personalized medicine.\n\nRecently, EFLM has chosen the name of \"Specialists in Laboratory Medicine\" to define all European Clinical pathologists, regardless of their training (M.D, Ph.D or Pharm.D)\n\nIn France, Clinical Pathology is called Medical Biology (\"Biologie médicale\") and is practiced by both M.D.s and Pharm.Ds.

Immunofluorescence, cytochemistry, the immunocytochemistry and FISH are also used in order make a correct diagnosis.\n\nThis stage allows the pathologist to determine the character of the liquid: “normal”, tumoral, inflammatory even infectious. Indeed, microscopic examination can often determine the causal infectious agent, in general a bacterium, a mould, a yeast, or a parasite, more rarely a virus.\n\nSee Automated analyser.\n\nThe analysers, by the association of robotics and spectrophotometry, allowed these last decades a better reproducibility of the results of proportionings, in particular in medical biochemistry and hematology.\n\nThe companies of in vitro diagnosis henceforth try to sell chains of automats, i.e. a system allowing the automatic transfer of the tubes towards the various types of automats of the same mark.

{"id": "3677766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3677766", "title": "Auctoritas", "text": "Auctoritas\n\nAuctoritas is a Latin word which is the origin of English \"authority\". While historically its use in English was restricted to discussions of the political history of Rome, the beginning of phenomenological philosophy in the 20th century expanded the use of the word.\n\nIn ancient Rome, \"Auctoritas\" referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence, and ability to rally support around his will. \"Auctoritas\" was not merely political, however; it had a numinous content and symbolized the mysterious \"power of command\" of heroic Roman figures.\n\nNoble women could also achieve a degree of Auctoritas. For example, the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Julio-Claudians had immense influence on society, the masses, and the political apparatus. Their Auctoritas was exercised less overtly than their male counterparts due to Roman societal norms, but they were powerful nonetheless.\n\nAccording to French linguist Emile Benveniste, \"auctor\" (which also gives us English \"author\") is derived from Latin \"\" (\"to augment\", \"to enlarge\", \"to enrich\"). The \"auctor\" is \"\"is qui auget\"\", the one who augments the act or the juridical situation of another.\n\n\"Auctor\" in the sense of \"author\", comes from \"auctor\" as founder or, one might say, \"planter-cultivator\". Similarly, \"auctoritas\" refers to rightful ownership, based on one's having \"produced\" or homesteaded the article of property in question - more in the sense of \"sponsored\" or \"acquired\" than \"manufactured\". This \"auctoritas\" would, for example, persist through an \"usucapio\" of ill-gotten or abandoned property.\n\nPolitically, \"auctoritas\" was connected to the Roman Senate's authority (\"auctoritas patrum\"), not to be confused with potestas or imperium (power), which were held by the magistrates or the people. In this context, \"Auctoritas\" could be defined as the juridical power to authorize some other act.\n\nThe 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen describes the \"force\" of \"auctoritas\" as \"more than advice and less than command, an advice which one may not safely ignore.\" Cicero says of power and authority, \"\"Cum potestas in populo auctoritas in senatu sit.\"\" (\"While power resides in the people, authority rests with the Senate.\")\n\nIn the private domain, those under tutelage (guardianship), such as women and minors, were similarly obliged to seek the sanction of their \"tutors\" (\"protectors\") for certain actions. Thus, \"auctoritas\" characterizes the \"auctor\": The pater familias \"authorizes\" – that is, validates and legitimates – his son's wedding \"in prostate\". In this way, \"auctoritas\" might function as a kind of \"passive counsel\", much as, for example, a scholarly authority.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic, during the days of the Roman Empire, the Emperor had the title of princeps (\"first citizen\" of Rome) and held the \"auctoritas principis\" – the supreme moral authority – in conjunction with the imperium and potestas – the military, judiciary and administrative powers.\n\nThe notion of auctoritas was often invoked by the papacy during the Middle Ages, in order to secure the temporal power of the Pope. Innocent III most famously invoked auctoritas in order to depose kings and emperors and to try to establish a papal theocracy.\n\nHannah Arendt considered \"auctoritas\" a reference to founding acts as the source of political authority in Ancient Rome. She took foundation to include (as \"augeō\" suggests), the continuous conservation and increase of principles handed down from \"the beginning\" (see also pietas). According to Arendt, this source of authority was rediscovered in the course of the 18th-century American Revolution (see \"United States of America\" under Founding Fathers), as an alternative to an intervening Western tradition of absolutism, claiming absolute authority, as from God (see Divine Right of Kings), and later from Nature, Reason, History, and even, as in the French Revolution, Revolution itself (see La Terreur). Arendt views a crisis of authority as common to both the American and French Revolutions, and the response to that crisis a key factor in the relative success of the former and failure of the latter.\n\nArendt further considered the sense of \"auctor\" and \"auctoritas\" in various Latin idioms, and the fact that \"auctor\" was used in contradistinction to – and (at least by Pliny) held in higher esteem than – \"artifices\", the artisans to whom it might fall to \"merely\" build up or implement the author-founder's vision and design.\n\n\n\n"}

Tangyuan can be either small or large, and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during \"Yuanxiao\" or the Lantern Festival, but also served as a dessert on Chinese wedding day, Winter Solstice Festival (), and any occasions such as family reunion, because of a homophone for union ()\n\nHistorically, a number of different names were used to refer to this food. During the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, the name was officially settled as yuanxiao (derived from the Yuanxiao Festival), which is used in northern China. This name literally means \"first evening\", being the first full moon after Chinese New Year, which is always a new moon.\n\nIn southern China, however, they are called \"tangyuan\". Legend has it that during Yuan Shikai's rule from 1912 to 1916, he disliked the name \"yuanxiao\" (元宵) because it sounded identical to \"remove Yuan\" (袁消), and so he gave orders to change the name to \"tangyuan\". This new moniker literally means \"round balls in soup\" or \"round dumplings in soup\". In the Hakka and Cantonese varieties of Chinese, \"tangyuan\" is pronounced as \"tong rhen\" or \"tong jyun\". The term \"tangtuan\" (Hakka: \"tong ton\", Cantonese: \"tong tyun\") is not as commonly used in these varieties as \"tangyuan\".\n\nThis type of glutinous rice flour dumpling is eaten in both northern and southern China. Sweet fillings such as sugar, sesame, osmanthus flowers, sweet bean paste and sweetened tangerine peel are used.\nIn the South, it is common to have tang yuan plain in a savory soup made with Chinese (daikon) radish and home made fish cake.\n\nFor many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, tangyuan is usually eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls where they are served, come to symbolise the family togetherness.\n\nWhile tangyuan was originally a food eaten during festivals, it has become a dessert consumed year-round rather than simply a festival food. For instance, tangyuan is traditionally in white color. Yet, in order to cater to consumers’ needs and changing tastes, dessert specialty shops create new flavors or colors of tangyuan by substituting the traditional filling with chocolate, mashed potato and pumpkin paste. Thus, tangyuan has already evolved into a dessert that is consumed by Chinese from time to time throughout the year and is no longer limited to festivals.\nIn both filled and unfilled tangyuan, the main ingredient is glutinous rice flour. For filled tangyuan, the filling can be either sweet or savoury. Northern variations mix sesame, peanuts, sweet bean paste and place them into bamboo baskets with rice flour, sprinkle water continuously on the rice flour to form the fillings and form round balls. Southern variations are typically larger, and are made by wrapping the filling into sticky rice flour wrapping and scrunching them into balls.\n\nSweet fillings can be:\n\nTangyuan are first cooked in boiling water. Once cooked, savoury filled tangyuan are served in a clear soup broth, whilst sweet filled Tangyuan are served in a ginger infused syrup. Nowadays, deep-fried Tangyuan have gained popularity in Southern part of China. Filled Tangyuan are put into hot oil to make its surface crispy.\n\nUnfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup (known in Cantonese cuisine as tang shui, which literally means \"sugar water\"). Common types include:\n\nThe most notable varieties come from Ningbo in Zhejiang Province. However, they are traditionally eaten throughout China.\n\nTangyuan have also come to be associated with the Winter Solstice and Chinese New Year in various regions. Today, the food is eaten all year round. Mass-produced tangyuan are commonly found in the frozen food section of Asian supermarkets in China and overseas.\n\nIn Indonesia, an adapted version, called \"Wedang Ronde\" (\"Wedang\" in Javanese means \"beverage\", and \"Ronde\" means \"round ball\"), is a popular food eaten during cold temperatures. The round colored balls of glutinous rice can be filled with crushed peanuts and sugar, or left plain and is served in a sweetened, mild ginger broth often boiled in fragrant pandan leaves. Crushed, toasted peanuts, tapioca pearls, and slices of coconut can also be added.\n\nIn Myanmar (Burma), \"mont lon yay paw\" (မုန့်လုံးရေပေါ်) is a traditional festive dish, served during Thingyan, and filled with pieces of jaggery and served with coconut shavings.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"ginataang bilo-bilò\" is also served in coconut milk, and sometimes local produce such as plantains (\"sabà\"), tapioca, and/or sweet potatoes are also added in.\n\nIn southern Vietnam, a similar dish, called \"chè xôi nước\", is served in a mild, sweet liquid flavoured with grated ginger root. In northern Vietnam, \"bánh trôi\" (also called \"bánh trôi nước\") and \"bánh chay\" are also very similar, with the latter being served with coconut milk.\n\n<includeonly></includeonly>\n"}
{"id": "3688898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3688898", "title": "Captain America's shield", "text": "Captain America's shield\n\nCaptain America's shield is a fictional item appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by the Marvel Comics superhero Captain America; he is seldom seen without it. Over the years, Captain America has had the use of several different shields of varying composition and design. His original heater shield first appeared in \"Captain America Comics\" #1 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics. The circular shield best associated with the character debuted in the next issue, \"Captain America Comics\" #2. Captain America was created by the team of writer-artist Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby.\n\nCaptain America's shield is virtually indestructible under normal conditions. While cosmic and magical or godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mjölnir without any visible damage. Due to its construction of a Vibranium and Steel alloy, it is able to absorb all kinetic energy and transfers very little energy from each impact, preventing Captain America from feeling recoil or transferred impact forces when blocking attacks. This alloy also allows him to deflect Adamantium blades without damage to the shield. These physical properties also mean the shield can bounce off of most smooth surfaces, ricocheting multiple times with minimal loss in aerodynamic stability or velocity. The shield can also absorb the kinetic impact of a fall, allowing Captain America to land safely even when jumping from several stories, as demonstrated in \"\".\n\nA common misconception is that the shield can \"magically\" return to Captain America . The \"superhuman serum\" that enhanced Captain America's physical attributes also improved his mental faculties—such as cognition, perception, balance, aim, and reflexes—to near genius-level. This allows him to instantly calculate ballistic-physics and predict the probable trajectory of objects in motion. This makes him a perfect shot. He can dodge or deflect bullets with his shield without collateral ricochet to civilians, to calculate where or how the shield will bounce and when it will return to his location, or trip a running person to cause them to fall into a specific position. \nIn \"\", he pulls the shield back to him after it is stuck, but this is through an electromagnet fastened on his arm. After his memories are altered to make him believe that he is a Hydra sleeper agent, Rogers uses his precise knowledge of the shield to put Sam Wilson, its current wielder, in a position where he will fail to save a senator from Flag-Smasher by arranging for Wilson to be forced to throw the shield in a manner that Rogers knows from his own experience will miss its target by mere millimetres, as part of his agenda to undermine Sam's status as Captain America.\n\nIn his debut, Captain America (secretly U.S. Army Private Steve Rogers) is equipped with a heater style shield made from steel. After complaints by rival comic-book publisher MLJ that the design was too similar to that of its own patriotic hero the Shield, Timely Comics replaced the triangular shield with a disc-shaped one.\n\nWhile the origin and fate of the original shield were not described in the original comics from the 1940s, the shield's fate was revealed decades later in 2001 through a retconned story. According to the tale, King T'Chaka of the African nation Wakanda met Captain America in early 1941 and gave him a sample of Vibranium, an alien metal with unique Vibration absorption properties and found only in Wakanda and the Savage Land. The new Vibranium sample was used to make Captain America's circular shield and his triangular one was retired.\n\nCaptain America received a second triangular shield that he used until given his disc-shaped shield, which was personally presented to him by President Franklin Roosevelt. This second triangular shield would be kept in storage with Rogers' other personal effects after the war. It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the superhero team the Avengers in \"The Avengers\" #4, and was kept at Avengers Mansion. It was destroyed by the supervillain Mr. Hyde during a raid on the mansion by Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil, and later \"plucked from time\" and restored by Zemo in \"Thunderbolts\" #105 (Oct. 2006). The shield (along with other sentimental items thought destroyed) was returned to Captain America. A third triangular shield is kept in the Smithsonian Institution. It was used by Captain America when he foiled a terrorist attack on the museum itself after the loss of his usual shield; it was then given to him in gratitude. This shield is destroyed several issues later by a Kree alien warrior.\n\nThe shield destroyed by Hydra and restored by Zemo was eventually passed on to Elijah Bradley, the teenage hero known as the Patriot and leader of the Young Avengers.\n\nIn 2010, the history of the original shield was revised. In the limited series \"Captain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers\", Captain America, Sergeant Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos meet Azzari (grandfather of T'Challa) -- the Black Panther and king of Wakanda during World War II. Aided by Wakandan military forces, they successfully repel a series of Nazi assaults led by the Red Skull and Baron Strucker. During the battle, the Red Skull (wearing a battle-suit) crushes the triangular shield, and Captain America uses a circular Vibranium shield provided by T'Chaka to incapacitate the Skull. The weapon serves as the inspiration for the circular shield that the super-soldier begins using upon his return to America, and the encounter marks the beginning of friendly relations between the United States and Wakanda.\n\nThe circular shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in \"Captain America Comics\" #2 (April 1941). A indestructible concavo-convex metal disc approximately in diameter, weighing 12 pounds. It has remained Captain America's most constant shield over the decades.\n\nIn \"Captain America\" #255 (March 1981), it is established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The shield is created by a fictional American metallurgist named Myron MacLain, who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort. MacLain experiments with the indestructible vibration-absorbing metal Vibranium.\nDuring one of his experiments to fuse Vibranium with an experimental Steel alloy, MacLain falls asleep and awakens to find that the resulting alloy had set in a tank hatch mold. It was then painted to become Captain America's symbol. MacLain would later attempt to recreate the shield's metal to no avail, his experiments instead eventually yielding the super-metal Adamantium.\n\nRogers' indestructible shield is more durable than regular Adamantium and one of the most indestructible objects in The Marvel Universe. The Vibranium grants the shield unusual properties, allowing it to absorb all of the kinetic impact and vibrations from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process. The Vibranium is also a factor in the way Rogers throws his shield: he often uses it to ricochet and strike multiple opponents or stationary objects with little loss of velocity in its forward movement after each impact.\n\nWhen Rogers returns from suspended animation, Tony Stark \"improves\" the shield by incorporating electronic and magnetic components in it so that Rogers can even control it in flight. Rogers soon discards the additional components because he finds that it upsets the balance of the shield when thrown.\n\nAfter Rogers' death, Stark takes over custody of the shield, with one replica on display in a museum, and another replica buried with Rogers. The real one is kept by Stark to be used by the new Captain America, whenever they deem it appropriate to train a new one. After failing to find a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent capable of throwing it properly, Stark offers the shield to Clint Barton (known at that time as Ronin), who does manage to throw it. During a confrontation involving the Young Avengers, he scolds Kate Bishop for using the Hawkeye name. She tells him that the \"Real Cap\" gave her that name in honor of his at the time dead friend, so this leads Barton to refuse to be Captain America. The shield is subsequently stolen by the Winter Soldier, who did not want anyone else to carry the shield. Inevitably, in an effort to honor Rogers' last wishes, Stark offers to let the Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes) keep the shield, and to serve as the new Captain America. Bucky accepts. This offer is made \"off the books\", and only the two of them, the Black Widow, and the Falcon, are aware of the situation.\n\nAlthough Bucky attempted to return the shield to Rogers after his resurrection, Rogers let Bucky keep it as he felt that he could do more good in his new role as Commander Steve Rogers rather than Captain America, using a photonic shield in its place when circumstances called for him to go into combat. He reclaimed the shield for good after Bucky was apparently killed during the \"Fear Itself\" event- Bucky really going underground after his past as the Winter Soldier was exposed-, which also resulted in the shield being broken and reassembled by Asgardian blacksmiths, who add some of the mystical metal Uru to the reconstructed shield, making it even stronger than before, although it is left with a noticeable scar that Rogers decided to keep to give the shield character. This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, or considered canon, as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar.\n\nIn the 2003-2004 Marvel Comics/DC Comics inter-company crossover limited series \"JLA/Avengers\", Superman is given the shield by Captain America to wield in battle in the final confrontation with Krona, and is impressed with its might. When he asks where he could get one just like it while battling foes, Thor replies, \"Enjoy it while thou canst, Superman. There is none other like it in \"all\" the worlds\". Throughout the final battle, the shield changes forms between the pointed shield and the circular shield due to various temporal ripples caused by Krona's equipment, and Superman even loses the shield altogether at one point when he morphs into his energy form while Cap reacquires the photonic shield, although the metal shield reappears on Superman's arm after he morphs back into his regular form.\n\nOver time the shield has been damaged or destroyed several times within the confines of the Earth-616 continuity:\n\nIn \"The Avengers\" #215–216, the Molecule Man used his total control over matter to disintegrate the shield, along with Thor's hammer, Iron Man's armor, and the Silver Surfer's board. After he does so, he comments that the board's molecules are \"weird\", and while there are \"odd forces interweaving\" among the hammer's molecules, the shield is \"weirdest of all\". He later reassembles these items, with the exception of the armor, as the electronic circuits are too complicated for him to understand at that time.\n\nDuring the 1984-1985 \"Secret Wars\" limited series, the shield is partially destroyed by Doctor Doom, who has stolen the power of the godlike being known as the Beyonder. Even broken, Rogers is able to wield what is left as an effective weapon, with the shield largely retaining its balance when thrown. When the Beyonder reclaims its power, the heroes are temporarily granted the ability to realize their wishes. Rogers uses this to reconstruct the shield.\n\nDuring the 1991 miniseries \"The Infinity Gauntlet\", Thanos, who possesses near-omnipotence via the Infinity Gauntlet, shatters the shield with a blow of his fist while in combat with Captain America. The shield is soon restored by Thanos' alleged granddaughter, Nebula, when she obtains the Gauntlet and uses it to undo the events of Thanos's temporary godhood, resulting in her erasing the death and destruction that Thanos had caused over the previous 24 hours.\n\nDue to a stray molecule being out of place when Rogers reconstructed the shield using the Beyonder's residual power, a vibranium 'cancer' was introduced to the shield, spreading with each subsequent impact until it finally shattered after it was retrieved from the bottom of the ocean. Learning that the vibranium cancer would require the destruction of the shield in order to cure it, Rogers took the shield to the main vibranium deposit in Wakanda so that he could use a device created by Tony Stark to halt the 'cancer' before it could contaminate the Wakandan vibranium and destroy the world, only to be intercepted by the villain Klaw, who sought to absorb the power and become stronger. Fortunately, the amount of energy Klaw had absorbed was released when he struck the shattered shield with full force after Rogers picked it up on reflex, resulting in Klaw unintentionally restoring the shield to its original state, realigning its molecules and destroying the cancer.\n\nIn \"Avengers\" Vol. 3 #63 (March 2003), an enraged Thor, wielding the Odinforce, scrapes the shield. Thor later repairs it.\n\nIn \"Thor\" Vol. 2 #73 (January 2004) an enraged King Thor destroyed the shield with Rune Magic, killing Steve Rogers with it. This timeline was later erased in \"Thor\" Vol. 2 #79.\n\nDuring the 2011 miniseries \"Fear Itself\", the Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and brother to Odin, breaks it in half with his bare hands. After the battle, the shield is repaired by Asgardian dwarves and Tony Stark with added Asgardian uru-infused enhancements and Stark's own technology to make it stronger, though a scar is left, and the dwarves are unable to repair it. Stark offers a solution to the scar, but Rogers declines, saying that it \"gave the old girl a little bit of character\". This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines, or considered canon, as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar.\n\n\nIn issue #7 of the Marvel series \"\" the shield is stored in a trophy room belonging to the alien \"Horde\" invaders.\n\n\nCaptain America's shield is a recurring image throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise:\n"}

One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a fourteen-year-old assistant waiter Henri Charpentier in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Café de Paris. He was preparing a dessert for the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, whose guests included a beautiful French girl named Suzette. This story was told by Charpentier himself in \"Life à la Henri\", his autobiography, although later contradicted by the \"Larousse Gastronomique\".\n\nIt was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste . . . He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Crêpes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. \"Will you,\" said His Majesty, \"change Crêpes Princesse to Crêpes Suzette?\" Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane.\n\nDifferent sources (like the \"Larousse Gastronomique\") however doubt that Charpentier, rather than the head waiter, was serving the prince, because he would have been too young. A less fantastical version emerges from Elsie Lee's interview with him in the 1950s. There, Charpentier explained at length that \"his complicated version began as the dish of pancakes with fruit sauce his foster mother made on very special occasions.\" The addition of liqueur was \"au courant\" among chefs in Paris at the time.\n\nThe other claim states that the dish was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853–1924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897, Reichenberg appeared in the Comédie Française in the role of a maid, during which she served crêpes on stage. Monsieur Joseph, owner of Restaurant Marivaux, provided the crêpes. He decided to flambé the thin pancakes to attract the audience's attention and keep the food warm for the actors consuming them. Joseph was subsequently director of the Paillard Restaurant in Paris and was later with the Savoy Hotel in London.\n\nIn 1896, Oscar Tschirky published the recipe as \"Pancakes, Casino Style\" with everything in place except the final flambée. Escoffier described \"Crêpes Suzette\" in the English version of his \"Guide Culinaire\" in 1907 (French 1903) the same way, also without the final flambée.\n\nThe dish was already a specialty of the French restaurant Marie's by 1898.\n"}

They contain fruit juice, have no artificial colours or flavours, and come in five flavours: lemon (yellow), lime (green), strawberry (red), blackcurrant (purple) and orange (orange).\n\nRowntree's Fruit Pastilles originated in Fawdon, Tyneside, England in 1881.\n\nAt Rowntree's factory in Fawdon, Tyneside in 1881, Rowntree introduced Fruit Pastilles, and the product proved to be a great success, accounting for about 25 percent of the company's tonnage by 1887.\n\nTubes of Fruit Pastilles are wrapped in foil-backed paper (paper on the inside, foil on the outside) with a paper wrapper over the top.

While in sujud, a Muslim is to praise and glorify Allah. The position involves having the forehead, nose, both hands, knees and all toes touching the ground together.\n\nSujud (prostration) is one of the main pillars of daily prayer in Islam. A single act of sujud is called a sajdah (plural \"sajadāt\"). Muslims do sujud several times in each prayer, depending on the number of \"raka'at\" of prayer: two sajadat are performed every raka'ah, and prayers vary in obligatory length between two and four raka'at (additional supererogatory raka'at are often performed as \"sunnah muakkadah\", or emulation of the example of Muhammad as represented in the sahih hadith). A raka'ah is a unit of set actions that have to be performed in a prayer. The shortest \"fard\" (obligatory) Muslim prayer is that of \"fajr\", performed immediately before sunrise. It consists of two raka'ah. The raka'ah can be described as follows:\n\nPoints 1-7 define one raka'ah. Thus, the shortest prayer, that of fajr, contains four sajadat. For Hanafis, witr prayer is three raka'ahs, which is for them considered wajib, a level of necessity below that of fard but above all else: in practice, this makes witr obligatory.\n\nWhile in sujud, the use of a turbah (a small piece of soil or clay, often a clay tablet), on which a person places their forehead, is compulsory in most Shi'a schools of Islam.\n\nThis is from the sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that whenever he used to hear news which would make him happy, he would make sujud to thank Allah.\n\nDuring the recitation of the Qur'an and during loud recitation prayers there are fifteen places where, when Muhammad recited a certain \"ayah\" (verse), he prostrated to God.\n\nThe verses are:\n\nIn most copies of the Qur'an these are indicated by the symbol ۩ , with an over-line on the word/s that invoked the prostration. Muslims must prostrate once in order to follow the Sunnah (example) of Muhammad and recite any one or more of the following along with Takbeer before and after the sujud, \n\nSujud Sahwi or Sajdah of forgetfulness occurs during the ritual \"salat\" prayer. Out of forgetfulness a person can either omit obligatory parts of salat (Qabli) or add to the salat (Ba'adi). In either cases the person corrects his/her salat by doing the Sujud Sahwi.\n\nSujud is made only to God. In prayer, Muslims face the Kaaba in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, but make their sujud to God, not the Kaaba. The Kaaba is only a united direction that Muslims face as it is the order of God in the Qur'an. If any person claiming to be Muslim makes a sujud to any thing/deity/person other than God, he is considered a disbeliever, unless it is forced upon them.\n\nThere are numerous things that a Muslim can say during sujud as is evident from the example of Muhammad. Among them are \"duas\" (prayers for God's help), \"hamd\" (praising of God), \"tasbih\" (glorifying God) and statements of Muhammad which make a person humble. Muslims are not allowed to recite the Qur'an during sujud. During the obligatory sujud during prayer one recites, \"\".\n\n\n"}

This may, however, not have the same characteristics as traditionally made khoa.\n\nKhoa is normally white or pale yellow. If prepared in the winter, it may be saved for use in the summer, and may acquire a green tinge and grainier texture from a harmless surface mould. This is called \"hariyali\" (green khoa) and is used in recipes where the khoya is thoroughly cooked, e.g., \"gulab jamun\". With the advent of refrigeration, the production of hariyali is rare.\n\nKhoya is classified into different types, based on moisture content. Different types of khoya are used for different preparations.\n\n\nKhoa is used in various types of sweets: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "3707734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3707734", "title": "Intonation (linguistics)", "text": "Intonation (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, intonation is variation in spoken pitch when used, not for distinguishing words as sememes (a concept known as tone), but, rather, for a range of other functions such as indicating the attitudes and emotions of the speaker, signalling the difference between statements and questions, and between different types of questions, focusing attention on important elements of the spoken message and also helping to regulate conversational interaction. (The term \"tone\" is used by some British writers in their descriptions of intonation but to refer to the pitch movement found on the nucleus or tonic syllable in an intonation unit.)\n\nAlthough intonation is primarily a matter of pitch variation, it is important to be aware that functions attributed to intonation such as the expression of attitudes and emotions, or highlighting aspects of grammatical structure, almost always involve concomitant variation in other prosodic features. David Crystal for example says that \"intonation is not a single system of contours and levels, but the product of the interaction of features from different prosodic systems – \"tone\", \"pitch-range\", \"loudness\", \"rhythmicality\" and \"tempo\" in particular.\"\n\nMost transcription conventions have been devised for describing one particular accent or language, and the specific conventions therefore need to be explained in the context of what is being described. However, for general purposes the International Phonetic Alphabet offers the two intonation marks shown in the box at the head of this article. Global rising and falling intonation are marked with a diagonal arrow rising left-to-right and falling left-to-right , respectively. These may be written as part of a syllable, or separated with a space when they have a broader scope:\n\nHere the rising pitch on \"street\" indicates that the question hinges on that word, on where he found it, not whether he found it.\n\nHere, as is common with \"wh-\" questions, there is a rising intonation on the question word, and a falling intonation at the end of the question.\n\nIn many descriptions of English, the following intonation patterns are distinguished:\n\nIt is also common to trace the pitch of a phrase with a line above the phrase, adjacent to the phrase, or even through (overstriking) the phrase. Such usage is not supported by Unicode as of 2015, but the symbols have been submitted. The following example requires an SIL font such as Gentium Plus.\n\nAll vocal languages use pitch pragmatically in intonation—for instance for emphasis, to convey surprise or irony, or to pose a question. Tonal languages such as Chinese and Hausa use intonation in addition to using pitch for distinguishing words. \nMany writers have attempted to produce a list of distinct functions of intonation. Perhaps the longest was that of W.R. Lee, who proposed ten. J.C. Wells and E. Couper-Kuhlen both put forward six functions. Wells's list is given below; the examples are not his:\nIt is not known whether such a list would apply to other languages without alteration.\n\nThe description of English intonation has developed along different lines in the US and in Britain.\n\nBritish descriptions of English intonation can be traced back to the 16th century. Early in the 20th century the dominant approach in the description of English and French intonation was based on a small number of basic \"tunes\" associated with intonation units: in a typical description, Tune 1 is falling, with final fall, while Tune 2 has a final rise. Phoneticians such as H. E. Palmer broke up the intonation of such units into smaller components, the most important of which was the \"nucleus\", which corresponds to the main accented syllable of the intonation unit, usually in the last lexical word of the intonation unit. Each nucleus carries one of a small number of nuclear tones, usually including fall, rise, fall-rise, rise-fall, and possibly others. The nucleus may be preceded by a \"head\" containing stressed syllables preceding the nucleus, and a \"tail\" consisting of syllables following the nucleus within the tone unit. Unstressed syllables preceding the head (if present) or nucleus (if there is no head) constitute a \"pre-head\". This approach was further developed by Halliday and by O'Connor and Arnold, though with considerable variation in terminology. This \"Standard British\" treatment of intonation in its present-day form is explained in detail by Wells and in a simplified version by Roach. Halliday saw the functions of intonation as depending on choices in three main variables: \"Tonality\" (division of speech into intonation units), \"Tonicity\" (the placement of the tonic syllable or nucleus) and \"Tone\" (choice of nuclear tone); these terms (sometimes referred to as \"the three T's\") have been used more recently.\n\nResearch by Crystal emphasized the importance of making generalizations about intonation based on authentic, unscripted speech, and the roles played by prosodic features such as tempo, pitch range, loudness and rhythmicality in communicative functions usually attributed to intonation.\n\nThe transcription of intonation in such approaches is normally incorporated into the line of text. A typical example would be:\n\nIn this example, the | mark indicates a division between intonation units.\n\nAn influential development in British studies of intonation has been Discourse Intonation, an offshoot of Discourse Analysis first put forward by David Brazil. This approach lays great emphasis on the communicative and informational use of intonation, pointing out its use for distinguishing between presenting new information and referring to old, shared information, as well as signalling the relative status of participants in a conversation (e.g. teacher-pupil, or doctor-patient) and helping to regulate conversational turn-taking. The description of intonation in this approach owes much to Halliday. Intonation is analysed purely in terms of pitch movements and \"key\" and makes little reference to the other prosodic features usually thought to play a part in conversational interaction.\n\nThe dominant framework used for American English from the 1940s to the 1990s was based on the idea of pitch phonemes, or tonemes. In the work of Trager and Smith there are four contrastive levels of pitch: low (1), middle (2), high (3), and very high (4). (Unfortunately, the important work of Kenneth Pike on the same subject had the four pitch levels labelled in the opposite way, with (1) being high and (4) being low). In its final form, the Trager and Smith system was highly complex, each pitch phoneme having four pitch allophones (or allotones); there was also a Terminal Contour to end an intonation clause, as well as four stress phonemes. Some generalizations using this formalism are given below. It should be noted that the American linguist Dwight Bolinger carried on a long campaign to argue that pitch \"contours\" were more important in the study of intonation than individual pitch levels.\n\n\nThus the two basic sentence pitch contours are rising-falling and rising. However, other within-sentence rises and falls result from the placement of prominence on the stressed syllables of certain words.\n\nNote that for declaratives or wh-questions with a final decline, the decline is located as a step-down to the syllable after the last prominently stressed syllable, or as a down-glide on the last syllable itself if it is prominently stressed. But for final rising pitch on yes–no questions, the rise always occurs as an upward step to the last stressed syllable, and the high (3) pitch is retained through the rest of the sentence.\n\nA more recent approach to the analysis of intonation grew out of the research of Janet Pierrehumbert and developed into the system most widely known by the name of ToBI (short for \"Tones and Break Indices\"). The approach is sometimes referred to as autosegmental. The most important points of this system are the following:\n\nA simplified example of a ToBI transcription is given below. In this example, two phrases \"we looked at the sky\" and \"and saw the clouds\" are combined into one larger intonational phrase; there is a rise on \"sky\" and a fall on \"clouds\":\n\nBecause of its simplicity compared with previous analyses, the ToBI system has been very influential and has been adapted for describing several other languages.\n\nFrench intonation differs substantially from that of English. There are four primary patterns.\n\n\nThe most distinctive feature of French intonation is the continuation pattern. While many languages, such as English and Spanish, place stress on a particular syllable of each word, and while many speakers of languages such as English may accompany this stress with a rising intonation, French has neither stress nor distinctive intonation on a given syllable. Instead, on the final syllable of every \"rhythm group\" except the last one in a sentence, there is placed a rising pitch. For example (note that as before the pitch change arrows ↘ and ↗ apply to the syllable immediately following the arrow):\n\n\nAdjectives are in the same rhythm group as their noun. Each item in a list forms its own rhythm group:\n\n\nSide comments inserted into the middle of a sentence form their own rhythm group:\n\n\nAs can be seen in the example sentences above, a sharp fall in pitch is placed on the last syllable of a declarative statement. The preceding syllables of the final rhythm group are at a relatively high pitch.\n\nMost commonly in informal speech, a yes/no question is indicated by a sharply rising pitch alone, without any change or rearrangement of words. For example\n\n\nA form found in both spoken and written French is the \"Est-ce que ...\" (\"Is it that ...\") construction, in which the spoken question can end in either a rising or a falling pitch:\n\n\nThe most formal form for a yes/no question, which is also found in both spoken and written French, inverts the order of the subject and verb. There too, the spoken question can end in either a rising or a falling pitch:\n\n\nSometimes yes/no questions begin with a topic phrase, specifying the focus of the utterance. Then, the initial topic phrase follows the intonation pattern of a declarative sentence, and the rest of the question follows the usual yes/no question pattern:\n\n\nInformation questions begin with a question word such as \"qui, pourquoi, combien,\" etc., referred to in linguistics as interrogatives. The question word may be followed in French by \"est-ce que\" (as in English \"(where) is it that ...\") or \"est-ce qui\", or by inversion of the subject-verb order (as in \"where goes he?\"). The sentence starts at a relatively high pitch which falls away rapidly after the question word, or its first syllable in case of a pollysyllabic question word. There may be a small increase in pitch on the final syllable of the question. For example:\n\n\nIn both cases, the question both begins and ends at higher pitches than does a declarative sentence.\n\nIn informal speech, the question word is sometimes put at the end of the sentence. In this case, the question ends at a high pitch, often with a slight rise on the high final syllable. The question may also start at a slightly higher pitch:\n\n\nMandarin Chinese is a tonal language so pitch contours within a word distinguish the word from other words with the same vowels and consonants. Nevertheless, Mandarin also has intonation patterns that indicate the nature of the sentence as a whole.\n\nThere are four basic sentence types having distinctive intonation: declarative sentences, unmarked interrogative questions, yes–no questions marked as such with the sentence-final particle \"ma\", and A-not-A questions of the form \"He go not go\" (meaning \"Does he go or not?\"). In the Beijing dialect, they are intonationally distinguished for the average speaker as follows, using a pitch scale from 1 (lowest) to 9 (highest):\n\n\nThus, questions are begun with a higher pitch than are declarative sentences; pitch rises and then falls in all sentences; and in yes–no questions and unmarked questions pitch rises at the end of the sentence, while for declarative sentences and A-not-A questions the sentence ends at very low pitch.\n\nBecause Mandarin distinguishes words on the basis of within-syllable tones, these tones create fluctuations of pitch around the sentence patterns indicated above. Thus, sentence patterns can be thought of as bands whose pitch varies over the course of the sentence, and changes of syllable pitch cause fluctuations within the band.\n\nFurthermore, the details of Mandarin intonation are affected by various factors like the tone of the final syllable, the presence or absence of focus (centering of attention) on the final word, and the dialect of the speaker.\n\nIntonation in Punjabi has always been an area of discussion and experimentation. There are different studies [Gill and Gleason (1969), Malik (1995), Kalra(1982), Bhatia (1993), Joshi (1972 & 1989)] that explain intonation in Punjabi, according to their respective theories and models.\n\nChander Shekhar Singh (2014) carried forward a description of the experimental phonetics and phonology of Punjabi intonation based on sentences read in isolation. His research design is based on the classification of two different levels of intonation (horizontal level and vertical level). The first experiment (at the horizontal level) is conducted to investigate three utterance types: declarative, imperative, and interrogative. In his second experiment, the investigation of sentences is conducted to view intonation but in vertical sense. 'Vertical' here means a comparative analysis of intonations of the three types of sentences by keeping the nuclear intonation constant. \n\nThe experiment shows some extremely significant results. The vertical level demonstrates four different types of accentuations in Punjabi:\n\n\nThe second experiment provides a significant difference between the horizontal level and the vertical level.\n\nCruttenden points out the extreme difficulty of making meaningful comparisons among the intonation systems of different languages, the difficulty being compounded by the lack of an agreed descriptive framework.\n\nFalling intonation is said to be used at the end of questions in some languages, including Hawaiian, Fijian, and Samoan and in Greenlandic. It is also used in Hawaiian Creole English, presumably derived from Hawaiian. Rises are common on statements in urban Belfast; falls on most questions have been said to be typical of urban Leeds speech.\n\nAn ESRC-funded project (E. Grabe, B. Post and F. Nolan) to study the intonation of nine urban accents of British English in five different speaking styles has resulted in the IViE Corpus and a purpose-built transcription system. The corpus and notation system can be downloaded from the project's website. Following on this work is a paper explaining that the dialects of British and Irish English vary substantially.\n\nA project to bring together descriptions of the intonation of twenty different languages, ideally using a unified descriptive framework (INTSINT), resulted in a book published in 1998 by D. Hirst and A. Di Cristo. The languages described are American English, British English, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Italian, Romanian, Russian, Bulgarian, Greek, Finnish, Hungarian, Western Arabic (Moroccan), Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Beijing Chinese. A number of contributing authors did not use the INTSINT system but preferred to use their own system.\n\nThose with congenital amusia show impaired ability to discriminate, identify and imitate the intonation of the final words in sentences.\n\n\n\n"}

Together with another related classical doctrine, \"maṣlaḥa\" (welfare or public interest), it has come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times. The notion of \"maqasid\" was first clearly articulated by al-Ghazali (d. 1111), who argued that \"maslaha\" was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property. Although most classical-era jurists recognized \"maslaha\" and \"maqasid\" as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources (Quran and hadith) and \"qiyas\" (analogical reasoning). Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture. While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence. These scholars expanded the inventory of \"maqasid\" to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights (Rashid Rida); justice and freedom (Mohammed al-Ghazali); and human dignity and rights (Yusuf al-Qaradawi).\n\nJurist Imam Abu Ishaq al-Shatibi (d.1388) also wrote on Maqasid Al-Sharia in his work \"Al-Muwafaqaat fi Usool al-Sharia\". He defined \"maqasid al-shariah\" as \"the attainment of good, welfare, advantage, benefits and warding off evil, injury, loss of the creatures\". According to al-Shatibi, the legal ends of Islamic law \"are the benefits intended by the law. Thus, one who keeps legal form while squandering its substance does not follow the law.\"\n\nHowever, it was not until modern times that Islamic scholars have shown a renewed interest in the \"maqasid\". This scholarship began with the work of the Tunisian scholar Muhammad Al-Tahir Ibn Ashur (d. 1973 CE). Since the turn of the century, a number of Islamic scholars including Mohammad Hashim Kamali, Professor Imran Ahsan Khan Nyazee, Ahmad Raysuni, Halim Rane, Jasser Auda, and Tariq Ramadan have all advocated the \"maqasid\" approach and contributed to its development.\n\nSheikh Muhammad Abu Zahra believed that Shariah was a \"mercy to humanity\" with three major goals: \"nurturing the righteous individual\", \"establishing justice\", and \"realization of benefits\".\n\nOn 10 July 2014, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak gave a speech calling for an end to conflict between Shia and Sunni. He stated that Malaysia can be an \"example for other Muslim nations on what it means to be a progressive and developed nation based on the five objectives of Shariah - to uphold the faith, life, intellect, progeny and property.\" \"Our government's policies have always been based on these five principles of \"maqasid shariah\"... let us be an example of a Muslim country that is developed and progressive based on \"maqasid shariah\"\".\n\nIslamic scholars working in Islamic finance have attempted to elaborate on the objective of wealth (\"mal\") or financial transaction. A contemporary scholar (Laidin) postulates five objectives: \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3712168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3712168", "title": "Christmas dinner", "text": "Christmas dinner\n\nChristmas dinner is a meal traditionally eaten at Christmas. This meal can take place any time from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day itself. The meals are often particularly rich and substantial, in the tradition of the Christian feast day celebration, and form a significant part of gatherings held to celebrate Christmas. In some cases, there is a ritual element to the meal related to the religious celebration.\n\nThe actual meal consumed varies in different parts of the world with regional cuisines and local traditions. In many parts of the world, particularly former British colonies, the meal shares some connection with the English Christmas dinner involving roasted meats and pudding of some description. The Christmas pudding and Christmas cake evolved from this tradition.\n\nIn countries without a lengthy Christian tradition, such as Japan, the Christmas meal may be more heavily influenced by popular culture.\n\nIndian people cook a variety of foods, including Biryani with chicken or mutton, chicken and mutton curry, followed by cake or sweets like Kheer. Long established Christian communities such as Goan Catholics have pork dishes and beef dishes as part of their main course of their Christmas dinner. These include Pork Vindaloo and Sorpatel. For dessert a dish called Bebinca is popular.\n\nJapanese Christmas cake, a white sponge cake covered with cream and decorated with strawberries, is often consumed and Stollen cake, either imported or made locally, is widely available. A successful advertising campaign in the 1970s made eating at KFC around Christmas a national custom. Its chicken meals are so popular during the season that stores take reservations months in advance.\n\nLebanese Christians celebrate Christmas dinners. The feast, usually on both the night of the 24th and lunch of the 25th, is a big one. Family gets together at both meals, and some have the leftovers from the dinner prior at the lunch the next day. Traditional offering for Christmas is sugar coated almonds. Roast turkey is the most common choice of meal. Roasted duck, Lebanese salad (Tabouleh) and pastries such as Honey cake and bûche de Noël are also common. Beirut celebrates Christmas by conducting glamorous and big Christmas parties. Western-style exhibitions of poinsettias, community Christmas trees and Christmas lights are very popular.\n\nChristmas dinner in the Philippines is called \"Noche Buena\" following Hispanic custom, and is held towards midnight of 24 December. This usually comes after the entire family has attended the late evening Mass called the \"Misa de Gallo\" (\"Mass of the Rooster\"). The centerpiece of the \"Noche Buena\" is often the \"hamón\" which is usually a cured leg of pork. This is usually served with \"queso de bola\", literally a ball of edam cheese covered in a red wax. Other ubiquitous dishes are pasta and for dessert, fruit salad. The dinner would usually be accompanied with \"tsokolate\" or hot cocoa, which is made with pure, locally grown cacao beans. Some families prefer \"tsokolate\" prepared from \"tablea\" or tablets of pressed cocoa powder that is either pure or slightly sweetened. Most of the food served on Noche Buena are fresh and usually prepared during the day of Christmas Eve.\n\nMiddle-class and affluent families tend to prepare sumptuous feasts which may include any of the following: \"lechón\" or spit-roasted pig; \"lumpia\"; \"escabeche\"; \"adobo\"; \"rellenong manok\" or stuffed chicken; roast turkey; \"mechado\" (beef stew); \"kaldereta\" (spicy beef stew); paella; and other traditional fiesta dishes. Less well-off families would opt for a more economical \"Noche Buena\"; the organising of even a simple gathering despite financial difficulties reflects the paramount importance in Filipino culture of familial (and, by extension, communal) unity.\n\nThis focus on the family is common to all Filipino socio-economic classes and ethnic groups that observe Christmas in that most – if not all – members from branch or extended families in a clan are expected to partake of the \"Noche Buena\". Relatives living abroad, especially OFWs, are highly encouraged to return home for the occasion, as it is the most important Filipino Christian holiday of the year. Most families prefer to exchange Christmas presents right after the dinner, in contrast to the Western custom of opening presents on Christmas morning.\n\nIn Austria, Christmas Eve is the celebration of the end of the pre-Christmas fast Christmas is usually celebrated by only Christian a s. Christmas Eve is historically the day that the tree is decorated and lit with real candles, so that the Christkindl may visit. Christmas Day is a national holiday in Austria and most Austrians spend the day feasting with their family. Fried carp, Sachertorte, and Christmas biscuits (Lebkuchen and Weihnachtssterne) are eaten, as are many other chocolate delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments. Christmas dinner is usually goose, ham served with Gluhwein, Rumpunsch, and chocolate mousse.\n\nIn the areas of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (e.g., Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, and much of Ukraine), an elaborate and ritualised meal of twelve meatless dishes is served on Christmas Eve (24 December in Lithuania and Poland), 6 January in Belarus and Ukraine). This stems from the tradition of treating the pre-Christmas season as a time of fasting, broken at nightfall on the eve of Christmas Day.\n\nA traditional Christmas meal in the Czech Republic is fried carp and potato salad which are eaten during Christmas dinner on the evening of 24 December. Many households also prepare a great variety of special Christmas biscuits to offer to visitors. These are prepared many days prior to the feast and take a long time to decorate, with the remainder usually ending up on the Christmas tree as decorations.\n\nIn Denmark, the traditional Christmas meal served on 24 December consists, according to one representative study, of duck (66% of households surveyed), roast pork with crackling (43%), turkey (8%), or goose (7%). The figures total more than 100% because some families prepare more than one kind of meat for Christmas dinner. The meat is served with boiled potatoes (some of which are caramelized, some roasted), red cabbage, and plenty of gravy. The main course is followed by a dessert of Risalamande, rice pudding served with cherry sauce or strawberry sauce, often with a whole almond hidden inside. The lucky finder of the almond is entitled to an extra present, the almond gift. Christmas drinks are Gløgg (mulled wine) and traditional Christmas beers, specially brewed for the season and which usually have a high alcohol content.\n\nJoulupöytä (translated \"Christmas table\") is the name of the traditional food board served at Christmas in Finland, similar to the Swedish smörgåsbord. It contains many different dishes, most of them typical for the season. The main dish is usually a large Christmas ham, which is eaten with mustard or bread along with the other dishes. Fish is also served (often lutefish and gravlax or smoked salmon), and with the ham there are also different casseroles usually with potatoes, rutabaga (swedes), or carrots. The traditional Christmas beverage is mulled wine (\"glögi\" in Finnish), which may be either alcoholic or non-alcoholic.\n\nIn France and some other French-speaking countries, a \"réveillon\" is a long dinner, and possibly party, held on the evenings preceding Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The name of this dinner is based on the word \"réveil\" (meaning \"waking\"), because participation involves staying awake until midnight.\n\nIn Germany, the primary Christmas dishes are roast goose and roast carp, although suckling pig or duck may also be served. Typical side dishes include roast potatoes and various forms of cabbage such as kale, Brussels sprouts, and red cabbage. In some regions the Christmas dinner is traditionally served on Christmas Day rather than Christmas Eve. In this case, dinner on Christmas Eve is a simpler affair, consisting of sausages (such as Bockwurst or Wiener) and potato salad. Sweets and Christmas pastries are all but obligatory and include marzipan, spice bars (\"Lebkuchen\"), several types of bread, and various fruitcakes and fruited breads such as \"Christstollen\" and Dresdener Stollen.\n\nIn Hungary, preparation for Christmas dinner begin on Christmas Eve and eaten on Christmas Eve at 18:00. The main dish is called Fisherman's soup or halászlé. For Christmas dessert, Bejgli or poppy seed roll is a traditional Hungarian Christmas cake with poppy seeds paste and walnut paste fillings.\n\nThe Icelandic Christmas dinner is eaten on Christmas Eve at 18:00. The main dish varies much between families. The most common is probably \"Hamborgarhryggur\", which is a kind of gammon steak. Other common dishes are roast game, such as reindeer, ptarmigan, and smoked lamb (hangikjöt), as well as a great variety of other roast fowl such as duck, turkey, also eaten by many on Christmas Day or on other occasions during the Christmas period.\n\nIn Ireland, preparations for Christmas dinner begin on Christmas Eve. People will boil the ham and may start to prepare vegetables. The Irish Christmas dinner which is eaten normally between 1.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. consists of turkey, ham, Brussels sprouts, roast potatoes, stuffing and various vegetables. The older tradition, still followed by many people in Ireland, is to serve a duck or a goose at Christmas.\n\nThe dinner usually consists of roast turkey (although other poultry such as goose, chicken, duck, capon or pheasant are alternatives), sometimes with roast beef or ham or, to a lesser extent, pork. In some parts of Ireland, especially County Cork and Limerick, Spiced Beef will also be eaten. The centrepiece is typically served with stuffing, gravy and sometimes forcemeat, pigs in blankets, cranberry sauce or redcurrant jelly, bread sauce, roast potatoes (sometimes also boiled or mashed), vegetables (usually boiled or steamed), particularly Brussels sprouts and carrots; dessert consists of Christmas pudding (or plum pudding), sometimes mince pies, Christmas cake or trifle, with brandy butter or cream.\n\nItalian regional traditions are varied. They are polarised in two areas: Northern Italy and Southern Italy (from Rome southwards). Moreover, often the Christmas Eve Supper is more important than the Christmas Dinner, because the Holy Mass is celebrated at midnight.\n\nThe primo is usually a kind of soup made with pasta (usually filled pasta, like tortellini) boiled in meat or capon broth. The secondo is very different in the two areas. In Northern Italy they usually eat poultry, often filled, or roasted or boiled and seasoned with sauces, like mostarda. In Southern Italy they eat the fried \"capitone\" eel, which is typical of Christmas Eve, because this is a fasting day. On Christmas Day they could eat roast lamb or fish.\n\nChristmas sweets are very varied and every region and sub region has its own. Generally speaking, in Northern Italy they eat a cake enriched with candied fruits, chocolate, raisins or pine nuts, known as panettone, followed by \"torrone\" (enriched with cherries, chocolate, sweets and more), nougat and nuts. In Southern Italy instead of one cake they serve many kinds of marzipan, biscuits, zeppole, cannoli, candied fruits, and fresh fruits. In the last few decades, panettone has become popular as a Christmas sweet all over Italy. Pandoro is also a very popular cake at Christmas and New Year, accompanied by a good Spumante.\n\nOne typical Dutch tradition is that of 'gourmet,' an evening-long event where small groups of people sit together around a gourmet-set and use their own small frying pan to cook and season their own food in very small portions. The host has prepared finely chopped vegetables and different types of meats, fish, prawns and shrimps. Everything is accompanied by different salads, fruits and sauces. The origin of gourmet lies most likely in the former Dutch colony Indonesia.\n\nThe Dutch also enjoy more traditional Christmas-dinners, especially meats and game like roast beef, duck, rabbit, and pheasant. This is generally served with different types of vegetables, potatoes and salads. In recent years, traditions from Anglo-Saxon countries have become increasingly popular, most notably the British-style turkey.\n\nThe most common dish is \"svineribbe\" (usually just \"ribbe\"), pork belly side prepared with seasoning (salt and pepper), for proper crackling. Usually it is consumed together with boiled vegetables, sauerkraut, lingonberry jam, potatoes, gravy, beers and a few shots of akevitt. In the western parts of the country, pinnekjøtt, mutton ribs, is by far the most popular Christmas dinner. The traditional lutefisk is also still eaten by some, but it is more commonly eaten at other occasions during the Christmas period.. For dessert rice pudding is very popular, served with a raspberry sauce.\n\nChristmas Day is a national holiday in Poland and most Poles spend the day feasting with their family. The Christmas meal is elaborate, served in the evening on 24 December, offering large quantities of food. This Christmas Eve meal is called Wigilia. After the first star appears in the sky, everyone shares the Christmas wafer (opłatek) and wishes good things for the coming year. Then supper begins. The meal is meatless, honouring Catholic tradition. Many households also prepare a great variety of special Christmas dishes, typically numbering 12 in honor of the 12 apostles. Dishes include: stuffed carp, fried carp, herring in wine sauce, herring in cream sauce, fruit compote, vegetable salad, soup (beetroot, mushroom, dried fruit over smashed chick peas, or fish) with uszka, pierogi, peas and carrots, boiled potatoes (except in Silesia, following a rhyme that states that bad luck ensues if one eats potatoes on Christmas Eve), mushroom cream sauce, sauerkraut, and makowiec (poppy seed rolled cake). Most households leave an empty plate at the table for an unexpected guest. Straw or hay is usually on the table to symbolise the manger. Some people place one scale from the carp in the wallet for financial success in the following year. During the season, pierniczki, or honey ginger cookies, are baked.\n\nTraditionally in Portugal the family gets together around the table on Christmas Eve to eat boiled dried-salted cod accompanied with boiled cabbage or greens varying with what they have in the garden left over, boiled potatoes, boiled onions, boiled eggs, and chickpeas. Sometimes a simple dressing is made with onions, garlic or parsley. This meal is accompanied with generous amounts of olive oil.\n\nThere are variations across the country and, traditionally, turkey (sometimes also pork in some regions) is served for lunch on the 25th.\n\nRomanian food served during the holidays is a large multi-coursed meal, most of which consists of pork (organs, muscle, and fat). This is mainly a symbolic gesture for St. Ignatius of Antioch.\n\nDuring Christmastime, Romanians bake or buy various special dishes, including desserts, sweets or fries. Romanians most usually bake Cozonac, a cake made of flour, yolks, yeast and many other dependable ingredients, flavors, condiments and additions. There are several types of cozonac, with numerous recipes. Other Christmas dishes include piftie, sarmale or pork dishes.\n\nChristmas dinner in Slovakia is celebrated on 24 December; dinner takes place at around 5 to 6 pm. The traditional dinner includes oplátky (thin waffles with honey or garlic), sauerkraut soup (\"kapustnica\") with dried mushrooms and sausage (sometimes with dry plums), carp or other fish with potato salad, apples and Christmas biscuits and \"opekance\".\n\nIn Slovenian, Christmas Eve is called \"Sveta noč\" which means \"holy night\". The Family gathers for dinner at about 6 o'clock in the evening. Typical dishes are potica, \"pečenka\" and grilled turkey. Mulled wine and eggnog can be served with the food. Some families are also making Christmas biscuits before the dinner.\n\nIn Spanish, Christmas Eve is called \"Nochebuena,\" literally translated as \"Good Night.\" In Spain it is celebrated with a large family feast, which is eaten late in the evening and can last a couple of hours; some families attend midnight mass before or after the meal. In Spain, Christmas Eve is a time for celebrating in neighbourhood bars and cafes, and around the table with family and friends. It is a time for gift exchanges or Santa Claus although it is mainly performed on Epiphany, which occurs on 6 January.\n\nThe Swedish Christmas dinner or \"Julbord\" consists of three courses. The first is a variety of fish, usually different types of pickled herring and salmon, eaten with boiled potatoes or crisp bread. The second is cold cuts of meat, with the Christmas ham being the most important. Sausages, head cheese and leverpastej are also common, eaten with boiled potatoes or on crisp bread. The third course consists of warm dishes such as meatballs, small fried sausages and Janssons frestelse. Lutfisk is sometimes served with the third course or as a fourth course. Finally, a dessert of Ris à lá Malta (Risalamande, rice pudding) is served with cherry sauce or strawberry sauce, with a whole almond hidden inside. The finder of the almond is expected to get married before next Christmas.\n\nCommon drinks are Christmas beer, julmust and schnapps.\n\nChristmas dinner in the United Kingdom is usually eaten in the afternoon on 25 December. The dinner usually consists of turkey, pheasant, duck or goose, served with stuffing, gravy, sometimes pigs in blankets, cranberry sauce or redcurrant jelly; bread sauce; roast potatoes (sometimes also boiled or mashed); vegetables, particularly brussels sprouts and parsnips; with dessert of Christmas pudding (or \"plum pudding\"), sometimes mince pies or trifle, with brandy butter or cream.\nIn England, the evolution of the main course into turkey did not take place for years, or even centuries. At first, in medieval England, a main course of boar was sometimes served. Through the 16th and 17th centuries goose or capon was commonly served, and the rich sometimes dined upon peacock and swan.\nThe turkey appeared on Christmas tables in England in the 16th century, and popular history tells of King Henry VIII being the first English monarch to have turkey for Christmas. The 16th century farmer Thomas Tusser noted that by 1573 turkeys were commonly served at English Christmas dinners. The tradition of turkey at Christmas rapidly spread throughout England in the 17th century, and it also became common to serve goose which remained the predominant roast until the Victorian era. (it was quite common for Goose \"Clubs\" to be set up, allowing working-class families to save up over the year towards a goose before this). A famous English Christmas dinner scene appears in Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843), where Scrooge sends Bob Cratchitt a large turkey. The pudding course of a British Christmas dinner may often be Christmas pudding, which dates from medieval England. Trifle, mince pies, Christmas cake or a yule log are also popular.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, Christmas dinner is similar to that of Britain. Traditional Christmas dinner features turkey with stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and vegetables such as carrots, turnip, parsnips, etc. Other types of poultry, roast beef, or ham is also used. For dessert, pumpkin or apple pie, raisin pudding, Christmas pudding, or fruitcake are the staple. Eggnog, a milk-based punch that is often infused with alcohol, is also popular around the holiday season. Other Christmas items include Christmas cookies, butter tarts, and shortbread, which are traditionally baked before the holidays and served to visiting friends at Christmas and New Year parties, as well as on Christmas Day.\n\nIn French-speaking Canada, traditions may be more like those of France. (See Réveillon) Other ethnic communities may continue to use old world traditions as well.\n\nIn Honduras, tamales are traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve evening. Turkey has become popular in the last few years.\nThe traditional Honduran Christmas dinner is served around midnight on the 24th of December.\nThe meal consists of tamales, roast pork leg, accompanied by \"torrejas,\" for dessert and eggnog. The tamales are made of maize dough filled with chicken or pork, chunks of potato and carrot, chickpeas, and whole green olives. They are wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to perfection. The pork leg may be fresh or smoked and is usually roasted all day long. The skin of the pork is left on during roasting resulting in a delicacy known as \"chicharron,\" a treat rivaled for at many a Honduran family table. The traditional recipe for seasoning the Christmas pork leg has often been passed down in a given family through generations. Turkey has become quite popular as well in recent years due to strong US/Honduran familial ties. \"Torrejas,\" the Honduran Christmas dessert is made of a French toast like bread that is soaked in dark syrup made from \"rapadura,\" blocks of very dark sugar. The syrup is seasoned with whole cloves and whole cinnamon. After dinner the meal is topped off with Honduran style eggnog known as \"rompopo.\"\n\nIn Mexico traditional Christmas dinner is a shared event which is celebrated on Christmas Eve, or \"Noche Buena\". With a location being set by a family, the host usually contributes the bulk of decorations, food, and dinner ware; guests are expected to contribute with a side dish, dessert, or alcoholic beverages. Traditional foods differ by region, but include tamales, atole, pozole, birria, menudo. Dishes which are usually only prepared during Christmas time are romeritos, bacalao, and stuffed turkey. Tamale preparation varies from region to region. It is usual for tamale fillings to include beef or pork with red sauce, chicken with a green chile sauce or cheese with jalapeño \"rajas\" or strips inside a corn or rice masa and steamed inside corn husks or banana leaves. Sweet tamales filled with pineapple, raisins, strawberries, or corn are also common. Sweets such as flan, a brulee-like custard with carmelized sugar,buñuelos, fruit and milk or liquer-flavored gelatin or Champurrado. Beverages like canela (tea sweetened with pilloncillo), Rompope, and Ponche are also common favorites.\n\nIn some areas more Americanized fare such as brandy-glazed ham, chicken, turkey or sometimes duck is served. Stuffing is not common but has been imported by visiting relatives into some household but has not taken into popular cuisine. Often served are also mixed grilled, stewed with sauces, or raw vegetables like carrots, potatoes, spinach, cactus, onions, chayote squash and radishes. Salsa is always served as a garnish and accompanied by queso fresco, tortillas, and refried beans, if not \"sopa de arroz,\" rather rice cooked with tomato and spices. The bacalao fish is common in coastal zones, along with shrimp or fish soup.\n\nOften Christmas Eve or \"Noche Buena\" is more celebrated than Christmas Day in part due to the tradition of Posadas in the predominantly Catholic country. In some neighborhoods, block parties may be common with neighbors going house to house and sharing dishes of food. In smaller rural villages the entire congregation may join in a parish-wide celebration.\n\nThe tradition of \"recalentado\" (lit. reheating) is also widespread, with families and friends convening again in the afternoon of Christmas Day to enjoy the leftovers from the dinner. This tradition is also followed on New Year's Eve, with a subsequent recalentado on New Year's Day. Often, families go to other relatives for recalentado, so if a family stayed with the mother's relatives on Christmas Eve, they would go to the father's relatives for Christmas Day, for example.\n\nAlso, families wait until midnight to make a toast to the family and give each other hugs. After that, many families exchange gifts and open them rather than on Christmas morning. However, most Mexicans celebrate another day of gift-giving on Epiphany (6 January) to commemorate the gifts the Magi, or \"Reyes Magos\" (lit. King-Magicians), brought the baby Jesus on that date.\n\nChristmas traditions in the United States have many eclectic origins with those from the United Kingdom predominant, but many others over the past 400 years have come from Scandinavia, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and, most recently, Spanish speakers from Latin America and the Caribbean during the 20th century. Therefore, the substrate of the meal usually is British in origin: roasted root vegetables as a side dish, mashed potatoes, gravy, and the centerpiece being a stuffed roasted fowl (pheasant, goose, duck, or turkey) or an expensive cut of roasted beef or beef Wellington. In the South, an area that has a very high concentration of people of UK extraction from centuries past, Christmas is the time of year in which many variations on a country ham or Christmas ham get served. This is a much older British tradition that would predate the Victorian tradition of Dickens and his turkey and go all the way back into medieval England, brought by poorer classes who could not afford the turkey that was fashionable among wealthier men in the Stuart era. Biscuits (cookies) of many kinds have been present in America for hundreds of years and often are either gingerbread, snickerdoodles, or sugar cookies baked throughout the month of December and fashioned into many shapes and figures.\n\nUnlike the modern United Kingdom, however, there is no tradition for Brussels sprouts at the meal at all, mince pies are normally only served in the Deep South, and Christmas pudding is very rare. Fruitcakes like the Christmas pudding, though still prepared in pockets of the nation, are usually a national joke and any fruitcake of any kind is a disdained and maligned confection lampooned as an unwanted Christmas gift. The comic Johnny Carson once quipped, \"The worst Christmas gift is fruitcake… There is only one fruitcake in the entire world, and people keep sending it to each other, year after year.\". Many foreigners are skeptical of this fact, but indeed there is some truth to it: Manitou Springs, Colorado, holds an annual event in which unwanted fruitcakes are tossed in a contest to see who can throw the \"gift\" the farthest, with the locals building trebuchets and contraptions that are forbidden to have an electric motor. An elderly gentleman from Tecumseh, Michigan once made national news when he presented his countryman with the fact that he still had a fruitcake his great grandmother baked in 1878, and thus was over 130 years old. As of 2018, the same fruitcake is believed to be still at large in the care of one of his grandchildren, in a manner of speaking, proving Mr. Carson had a point.\n\nAlcohol and cocktails of all kinds are staples for both Christmas parties and family gatherings, where harder drinking is done amongst adults and youngsters usually get served soft drinks or a non-alcoholic version of what their parents drink, drinks like the Shirley Temple. A typical menu would include any combination of planter's punch, Kentucky bourbon and the cocktails that can be made from it, Wines from California, Washington, Virginia, or New York of many varying vintages meant to compliment the meal prepared by the host, Prosecco from Italy, hard cider from New England and California, wassail, Puerto Rican or Jamaican rum, champagne and other domestic sparkling white wines, and for individual cocktails the alcoholic version of eggnog, the poinsettia, and the Puerto Rican coquito, a cocktail composed of large amounts of coconut milk and rum.\n\nSpanish speakers on the East Coast tend to come from Caribbean nations and have had a marked influence on the way the holiday is celebrated in Florida and pockets of the East Coast cities. Accordingly, lechon, an spit roasted piglet, is the mainstay of the meal, not the turkey, as like other Americans a turkey has already been the centerpiece of the meal at Thanksgiving, about one month earlier. Tembleque is served for dessert and the crackling from the pig is a delicacy. West of the Mississippi, Mexicans have had a grand influence over the way the meal is prepared, including roasting corn in its husk and serving biscochitos.\n\nFurther regional meals offer diversity. Virginia has oysters, ham pie, and fluffy biscuits, a nod to its English 17th century founders. The Upper Midwest includes dishes from predominantly Scandinavian backgrounds such as lutefisk and mashed rutabaga or turnip. In the southern US, rice is often served instead of potatoes, and on the Gulf Coast, shrimp and other seafood are usual appetisers, and Charlotte Russe chilled in a bed of Lady Fingers (called just Charlotte) is a traditional dessert, along with pumpkin and pecan pies. In some rural areas, game meats like elk or quail may grace the table, often prepared with old recipes: it is likely that similar foodstuffs graced the tables of early American settlers on their first Christmases.\n\nAn Italian American meal for Christmas Eve can be the Feast of the Seven Fishes. Pannetone and struffoli are favoured desserts in such cases.\n\nIt is a common tradition among many Jewish Americans to eat American Chinese food on Christmas, because these were often the only establishments open on the holiday in many cities.\n\nChristmas lunch (in Australia, dinner refers to the evening meal) in Australia is based on the traditional English versions. However, due to Christmas falling in the heat of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, meats such as ham, turkey and chicken are sometimes served cold with cranberry sauce, accompanied by side salads or roast vegetables. Barbecues are also a popular way of avoiding the heat of the oven. Seafood such as prawns, lobster, oysters and crayfish are common, as are barbecued cuts of steak or chicken breasts, drumsticks and wings. In summer, Australians are also fond of pavlova, a dessert composed of fruit such as Strawberries, Kiwi Fruit and Passionfruit atop a baked meringue, with whipped cream. Trifle is also a favourite in Australia at Christmas time. Fresh fruits of the season include cherries and mangoes, plums, nectarine and peaches.\nIntroduced by Italian Australians, panettone is widely available in shops, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nThe Christmas customs of New Zealand are largely identical to the United Kingdom. Christmas dinner consists of roast turkey or lamb, roast vegetables, stuffing,gravy and cranberry sauce. Alternatively, roast ham served hot or cold may be offered as a main course, which is becoming more and more common. Seafood such as oysters, mussels and crayfish are not uncommon. Desserts are commonly Pavlova (served with whipped cream, fresh strawberries, kiwifruit and passionfruit), trifle, mince pies, Christmas pudding with custard or brandy butter. Enjoyment of non-British Christmas foods, such as stollen from Germany, Bûche de Noël from France, and panettone from Italy, was virtually unheard of in New Zealand until the late 1990s and is still rare today. Due to New Zealanders celebrating Christmas in the summer, it is also common to barbecue, and eat seasonal vegetables and fruit such as cherries and strawberries.\n\nIn Brazil, the Christmas meal is quite a feast, (served in the evening on 24 December) offering large quantities of food, such as a wide variety of dishes which include fresh vegetables, luscious fruits and Brazil nuts. Accompanying these are bowls of colorful rice and platters filled with ham and fresh salad (sometimes cold potato salad is also served) served with roast turkey. Also some parts of Brazil feature roast pork or chicken. Red, white wine and apple cider are common alcoholic beverages. Other Christmas items include a variety of desserts such as lemon tart, nuts pie, chocolate cake and also Panettone.\n\nOn Christmas Eve (Noche Buena), the extended family join together for a dinner of roast turkey, and white rice seasoned with garlic. Roast potatoes and uncooked sweetened apple puree are often served as well. The main dessert is panettone. It is usually accompanied by a cup of thick hot chocolate. Less common desserts include a special marzipan made out of Brazil Nuts (due to the scarcity and expense of almonds in Peru) and assorted bowls with raisins, peanuts. At midnight, a toast is made, and good wishes and hugs are exchanged. A designated person runs to put Child Jesus in the Nativity scene. Then, the family members take their seat on the dining room while singing Christmas Carols.\n\nIn Colombia, the main Christmas meal is eaten on Christmas Eve night and it's called 'Cena de Navidad'; usually, the family gathers together for the meal, even if they have been in other places with friends before. In general, people make an effort to have plenty of food that night, typical dishes for the occasion vary from lechona, Ajiaco, Tamal, Bandeja paisa,Sudado de pollo, among others; in modern times kids often ask for Pizza, Lasagna, Hot Dogs or similar fast food for Christmas Eve; drinks for the dinner are usually fruit juices from all the variety that can be found in Colombia, the reunion can last from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am and sometimes it extends throughout the night until morning when people cook asado.\n"}

{"id": "3717731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3717731", "title": "California roll", "text": "California roll\n\nA California roll or California maki is a \"makizushi\" sushi roll that is usually rolled inside-out, and containing cucumber, crab or imitation crab, and avocado. Sometimes crab salad is substituted for the crab stick, and often the outer layer of rice in an inside-out roll (\"uramaki\") is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds, \"tobiko\" (flying fish roe) or \"masago\" (capelin roe).\n\nAs one of the most popular styles of sushi in the United States and Canada, the California roll has been influential in sushi's global popularity, and in inspiring sushi chefs around the world to create non-traditional fusion cuisine.\n\nThe identity of the creator of the California roll is disputed, with chefs from both Vancouver and Los Angeles claiming credit.\n\nThe theory is that the California roll was created in Canada by Japanese-born chef Hidekazu Tojo, a resident of Vancouver since 1971. Tojo insists he is the innovator of the \"inside-out\" sushi, and it got the name \"California roll\" because it was popular with patrons from Los Angeles. He has recounted how his original invention included cucumber, cooked crab, and avocado.\n\nA rival theory of the California roll credits a Los Angeles chef named Ken Seusa at the Kin Jo sushi restaurant near Hollywood. Mrs. Fuji Wade, manager of the restaurant credited Seusa with the invention in a report to an Associated Press news feed in 1979. Food writer Andrew F. Smith observes that this claim stood uncontested for more than 20 years.\n\nThe Associated Press story appeared very shortly after the term \"California roll\" was used in print, in the \"Los Angeles Times\" and an Ocala, Florida newspaper on November 25, 1979. The California roll was also featured by \"Gourmet\" magazine in 1980, and taken up by a restaurant critic for \"The New York Times\" the following year.\n\nAnother rival theory attributes the invention to Ichiro Mashita, another Los Angeles sushi chef, from Little Tokyo restaurant \"Tokyo Kaikan\". According to this account, Mashita began substituting avocado for \"toro\" (fatty tuna) in the off-season, and after further experimentation, developed the prototype, back in the 1960s (or early 1970s).\n\nEarly California roll recipes used frozen king crab legs, since surimi imitation crab was not yet available locally and importing it was not convenient. Cucumber, mayonnaise, and sesame seed were missing; these ingredients were all added later. The original California roll was wrapped traditional style, with the nori seaweed on the outside, which American customers tended to peel off. Therefore, the roll \"inside-out\", \"i.e.\", \"uramaki\" version was eventually developed. This adaptation has also been credited to Mashita by figures associated with the restaurant.\n\nAfter becoming a favorite in southern California, the dish became popular all across the United States by the 1980s. The roll contributed to sushi's growing popularity in the United States by easing diners into more exotic sushi options. Sushi chefs have since devised many kinds of rolls, beyond simple variations of the California roll.\n"}
