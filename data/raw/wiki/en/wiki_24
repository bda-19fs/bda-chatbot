It is a proprietary formulation of fractionated palm kernel oil (caprylic triglyceride), a medium-chain triglyceride. Accera, Inc., the company that makes Axona, states that during digestion, caprylic triglyceride is broken down into ketones, which provide an alternative energy source for the brain. Its use is based on the idea that the brain's ability to use its normal energy source, glucose, is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Axona was first sold in March 2009. \n\nIn 2013, FDA determined that Axona is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the labeling is false and misleading in that the product is labeled and marketed as a medical food but does not meet the statutory definition of a medical food. Axona has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug to treat Alzheimer's and the efficacy of managing the health of Alzheimer's patients by use of this medical food has been questioned by experts in the field, including the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nAxona is a medical food marketed to assist with dietary management of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Axona is formulated for oral administration and is sold by prescription. The largest ingredient in Axona is caprylic triglyceride, also known as fractionated coconut oil, a medium-chain triglyceride. caprylic triglyceride is Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) by the FDA.\n\nA medical food in the US is an official FDA product classification, and was originally defined by Congress as part of the Orphan Drug Amendments of 1988 as \"a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered through a feeding tube under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\" Medical foods are not drugs and cannot be marketed as treating or preventing a disease or condition; the FDA does not evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical foods.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is clinically characterized by a progressive decline in memory and language, and pathologically by accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Because Alzheimer’s disease is also characterized by a reduced ability of some areas of the brain to use glucose, some scientists have proposed that treatments targeting metabolic deficits in the brain of Alzheimer's patients may have efficacy.\n\nThe makers of Axona claim that after oral administration of Axona, the caprylic triglyceride in Axona are processed by enzymes in the gut, and the resulting medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are absorbed into the blood supply leading to the liver. The MCFAs rapidly pass directly to the liver, where they undergo oxidation to form ketones. Since the liver does not use ketones, they are released into the circulation to be used by nonliver tissues. These ketones can cross the blood-brain barrier and are then taken up by brain cells. While glucose is the brain’s chief energy source, ketones normally serve as the \"backup\" energy source.\n\nKetones act as an alternative energy source for brain cells that have an impaired ability to use glucose (sugar) as a result of Alzheimer’s disease, and the makers of Axona claim that this may have medical benefits.\n\nAxona has been evaluated in Phase II clinical trials, paid for and conducted by Accera, only one of which was published in an open-access journal in 2009.\n\nThe product launched in 2009. By 2012 it was being administered to about 30,000 patients in the US.\n\nA 2011 story by ABC News noted widespread concern about Axona in the medical community, with some calling it \"snake oil.\"\n\nThe theory that the brain in Alzheimer's disease patients is better able to use ketones than glucose is not widely accepted among AD clinicians and researchers.\n\nThe Alzheimer's Association has classified Axona an \"alternative treatment\", has \"expressed concern that there is not enough evidence to assess the potential benefit of medical foods for Alzheimer’s disease\", and notes that the safety of Axona is not regulated in the way that drugs are.\n\nGlenn Smith, Ph.D, a clinical neuropsychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic, also noted that Axona's safety and efficacy are not known, and noted that \"the Alzheimer's Association doesn't recommend the use of medical foods, including Axona, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nIn 2013, FDA determined that Axona is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the labeling is false and misleading in that the product is labeled and marketed as a medical food but does not meet the statutory definition of a medical food. \n\n"}

The tradition was maintained at Wychnoure until at least the eighteenth century, but now the flitch required to be held remains only as a carving over the fireplace. At Little Dunmow in Essex a similar ceremony also survived into the eighteenth century. The tradition can be traced back to at least the fourteenth century at both sites and the Dunmow flitch is referred to in Chaucer. The awarding of a flitch at both sites seems to have been an exceedingly rare event.\n\nThe Dunmow tradition was revived in Victorian times, largely inspired by a book (\"The Flitch of Bacon\") by William Harrison Ainsworth. Flitch trials are still held in modern times at Great Dunmow. A counsel is employed to cross-examine the nominated couples and attempt to show they are undeserving of the award.\n\nThere is evidence that the flitch of bacon tradition existed outside Britain in mainland Europe and some would push its origins back as far as Saxon times. Historian Hélène Adeline Guerber associates the origins of the flitch of bacon ceremony with the Yule feast of Norse tradition in which boar meat is eaten in honour of the god Freyr.\n\nThe manor of Whichnoure (now Wychnor Hall) near Lichfield, Staffordshire was granted to Sir Philip de Somerville in the 10th year of the reign of Edward III (1336) from the Earl of Lancaster for a small fee but also on condition that he kept ready \"arrayed at all times of the year but Lent, one bacon-flyke hanging in his hall at Whichnoure, to be given to every man or woman who demanded it a year and a day after the marriage, upon their swearing they would not have changed for none other\".\n\nThe couple are required to produce two of their neighbours to witness that the oath is true. The oath that was to be sworn by the couple reads,\n\nHear ye, Sir Philip de Somervile, lord of Whichenoure, maintainer and giver of this Bacon, that I, (\"husband\"), syth I wedded (\"wife\"), my wyfe, and syth I had her in my kepyng and at wylle, by a Yere and a Day after our Marryage, I would not have changed for none other, farer ne fowler, richer ne powrer, ne for none other descended of gretter lynage, sleeping ne waking, at noo time; and if the said (\"wife\") were sole, and I sole, I would take her to be my wyfe before all the wymen of the worlde, of what condytions soevere they be, good or evyle, as helpe me God, and his Seyntys, and this flesh, and all fleshes.\n\nThe winning couple are escorted away in a grand ceremony with \"trompets, tabourets, and other manoir of mynstralcie\". Although this is a valuable prize, it does not seem to have been claimed very often. Horace Walpole, who visited Whichnoure in 1760, reported that the flitch had not been claimed for thirty years and that a real flitch of bacon was no longer kept ready at the manor. A replacement, carved in wood, was now displayed over the mantle of the fireplace in the main hall, presumably in order to continue to meet the conditions of the original land grant.\n\nWalpole is quite taken by this tradition and mentions it in several letters to his friends. In a letter to the Countess of Ailesbury (Lady Caroline Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll and widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury but by this stage married to Hon. H. S. Conway), Walpole with tongue firmly in cheek berates her for not having come to Whichnoure to claim the flitch: \"Are you not ashamed, Madam, never to have put in your claim? It is above a year and a day that you have been married, and I never once heard either of you mention a journey to Whichnoure.\" Describing the location and explaining why the flitch no longer gets claimed, he writes \"... it is a little paradise, and the more like an antique one, as, by all I have said, the married couples seem to be driven out of it.\" Walpole concludes, \"If you love a prospect, or bacon, you will certainly come hither.\"\n\nAn anonymous humorous piece appeared in Joseph Addison's \"Spectator\" in 1714 purporting to explain the rarity of the flitch being awarded in terms of the poor quality of the applicants. The writer claims that the source is the \"Register of Whichenovre-hall\" but the truth is that the piece is almost certainly entirely fictitious. The first couple to claim, according to this account, were at first successful, but then had the flitch taken away from them after they began to argue about how it should be dressed. Another couple failed when the husband, who had only reluctantly attended, had his ears boxed by his wife during the questioning. A couple who applied after only their honeymoon had finished passed the questioning but since insufficient time had elapsed were awarded just one rasher. One of only two couples to be successful in the first century of the tradition was a ship's captain and his wife who had not actually seen one another for over a year since their marriage.\n\nAs well as to married couples, a flitch of bacon was also given at Whichnoure to men in the religious profession one year and a day following their retirement.\n\nA rather better-known example of the awarding of a flitch of bacon to married couples occurred at Little Dunmow Priory in Essex. It is generally held to have been instituted by the family of Robert Fitzwalter in the 13th century. According to Rev. W. W. Skeat in his notes to the fourteenth-century \"The Vision of William Concerning Piers the Plowman\", In the present passage we have the earliest known allusion to the singular custom known as that of \"the Dunmow flitch of Bacon.\" The custom was—\"that if any pair could, after a twelvemonth of matrimony, come forward, and make oath at Dunmow [co. Essex] that, during the whole time, they had never had a quarrel, never regretted their marriage, and, if again open to an engagement, would make exactly that they had made, they should be rewarded with a flitch of Bacon.\" It is referred to in Chaucer (1343–1400) in a way that makes clear the reference would already be well known to the reader. It continued to be awarded until the middle of the 18th century, the last successful claim being made on 20 June 1751. The ceremony of this last flitch award was recorded by the artist David Ogborne who was present at the time to make sketches and, later, engravings. His images were later used as source material by Ainsworth for his novel, \"The Flitch of Bacon\". Ainsworth's 1854 novel proved so popular that it revived the custom which has continued in one form or another down to the present day and is now held every leap year.\n\nThe oath to be taken was very similar to the one at Whichnoure, that \"neither of them in a year and a day, neither sleeping or waking, repented of their marriage\". The couple are required to kneel on sharp stones in the churchyard while taking the oath and a verse was chanted;\n\nFollowing the taking of the oath, the couple are then paraded around the town with their bacon in a noisy ceremony, much as at Whichnoure.\n\nThe historical Dunmow flitch is known to have been successfully claimed only a total of six times, although there may have been more that are unknown (among the possible ones there are Montagu Burgoyne and his wife Elizabeth). Three are known prior to the dissolution of the monasteries from the records of the house of Sir Richard St George, and a further three awards are known from the records of the manor court at Dunmow now in the British Museum. There was a long gap after the dissolution, but the tradition was revived by Sir Thomas May in 1701 when he became the owner of the Priory.\n\nThere was an attempt made to claim the flitch on 12 June 1772 by John and Susan Gilder. The couple had given due notice of their claim and were accompanied by a large crowd of onlookers. However, the lord of the manor had ordered that the ceremony should not take place, and the gates of the Priory were nailed shut to prevent it. By 1809 the tradition was definitely abolished. A further attempt to claim the flitch was made in 1832 by Josiah Vine, a retired cheesemaker, who travelled with his wife from Reading to make his claim. He too was refused a trial by a very unsympathetic Steward of Little Dunmow. \"John Bull\" on 8 October 1837 reported that it had been revived by the Saffron Walden and Dunmow Agricultural Society. Apparently however, this flitch was merely distributed at the annual society dinner. In 1851 a couple from Felstead were also refused a trial at the Priory, but obtained a flitch from the people of nearby Great Dunmow who felt that they deserved it.\n\nThe flitch trials were revived in the Victorian era after the publication of Ainsworth's novel in 1854 which proved to be tremendously popular. Ainsworth aided the reinstitution by himself donating two flitches for the first of the revived ceremonies in 1855. They have been held ever since in one form or another except for a gap caused by the World Wars. The first ceremony after World War II was held in 1949, despite rationing still being in force. The modern trials are held every fourth year on leap years; the next one is planned for 2020. The event is organised by the Dunmow Flitch Trials Committee who employ a counsel to cross-examine the applicants in an attempt to save the bacon for the sponsors who donated it. The trial is decided by a jury.\n\nWhen first revived the original stones on which the couple knelt had been removed and the chair on which they were carried if successful is kept permanently in Little Dunmow Priory. However, replacements for both of these have been provided for the modern ceremony. The modern trials are held in the town of Great Dunmow rather than the location of the original custom at Little Dunmow, a smaller nearby village.\n\nDunmow claims to be the only location to have continued the \"flitch of bacon\" custom into the 21st century.\n\nAlthough the flitch ceremony at Dunmow is generally held to have originated with the Fitzwalters in the 13th century there are some who would date it to earlier Norman or Saxon times, one suggested date being 1104, the founding of the Little Dunmow Priory. This is partly because the flitch of Dunmow seems to have already been common knowledge in very early works such as the prologue to Chaucer's \"Wife of Bath\" and also in the \"Visions of Pierce Plowman\" by William Langland. Some would also read passages in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as alluding to the Dunmow flitch.\n\nIt is possible that the \"flitch of bacon\" custom was at one time quite widespread. There was a flitch of bacon tradition at the Abbey of St Melaine, Rennes, Brittany, where the bacon is said to have hung for six centuries without being claimed. In Vienna, there was a similar tradition in which the prize was a ham of bacon rather than a flitch. The ham was hung over the city gate, from where the winner was expected to climb up and remove it himself. One such winner had the prize revoked after winning it, after he inadvertently let slip that his wife would rebuke him for staining his coat while bringing down the ham.\n\nHistorian Hélène Adeline Guerber theorizes that the tradition traces back to an ancient Norse custom connected with the Yule feast, a Germanic pagan festival that in modern times has inextricably been absorbed into Christmas. Guerber theorizes that Yule is primarily dedicated to the god Thor, but is also important for the god Freyr (who rides a wild boar, Gullinbursti). A boar is eaten at Yule in Freyr's honour and the boar can only be carved by a man of unstained reputation. Guerber says that Freyr was the patron of gladness and harmony and was often invoked by married couples who wished for the same, and that this led to the custom of married couples who actually succeeded in living in harmony for a given period being rewarded with a piece of boar meat. Guerber states that it is this tradition that became the \"flitch of bacon\" custom after converting boar meat into bacon.\n\n\"The flitch of bacon\", subtitled \"The custom of Dunmow: a tale of English home\" is a novel by William Harrison Ainsworth first published in 1854. The central plot of the story is the flitch at Dunmow and the scheming by the leading character to be awarded it by marrying a succession of women in an attempt to find the right one. The description of the ceremony in the book is partly based on the art of David Ogborne, an eyewitness to the last ceremony in 1751.\n\n\"The Flitch of Bacon\" public house, of which the protagonist of Ainsworth's novel is the publican, still exists in Little Dunmow.\n\n\"The Flitch of Bacon\" is a comic opera from 1779 by William Shield and Sir Henry Bate Dudley.\n\n\"Made in Heaven\" is a 1952 film starring David Tomlinson and Petula Clark about a married couple attempting to win the Dunmow flitch.\n\n\"Dunmow Flitch\" is the instrumental theme song to the French television series \"Bonne Nuit les Petits\" which premiered in 1962 and was remade in 1994.\n\n\n"}

The gray rocks lining the walls of the western end of Titus Canyon are Cambrian age (570–505 million years old) limestone. These ancient Paleozoic rocks formed at a time when the Death Valley area was submerged beneath tropical seas. By the end of the Precambrian, the continental edge of North America had been planed off by erosion to a gently rounded surface of low relief. The rise and fall of the Cambrian seas periodically shifted the shoreline eastward, flooding the continent, then regressed westward, exposing the limestone layers to erosion.\n\nThe sediments have since been upturned, upfolded (forming anticlines), downfolded (forming synclines) and folded back onto themselves (forming recumbent folds).\n\nAlthough some of the limestone exposed in the walls of Titus Canyon originated from thick mats of algae (stromatolites) that thrived in the warm, shallow Death Valley seas, most of the gray limestone shows little structure. Thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) of this limey goo were deposited in the Death Valley region. Similar limestone layers may be seen at Lake Mead National Recreation Area and at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. At one of the bends in the canyon, megabreccia can be seen.\n\nTimbisha Native Americans carved petroglyphs on some of the rock faces in Titus Canyon, especially near natural springs.\n\nAdjacent to the canyon proper is Leadfield, a former mining town and now ghost town where in the 1920s prospectors mined for ore after hearing exaggerated claims that lead would be easy to find and the living conditions in the area would be easy to endure.

It adds all the destination IP addresses in the IP header, instead of using a multicast address. The traditional multicast schemes over Internet Protocol (IP) scale to multicast groups with many members, but they have scalability problems for a great number of groups. Multicast schemes can be used to minimize the bandwidth consumption. Xcast minimizes bandwidth consumption for small groups, by eliminating the signaling protocols and state information for every session of the standard IP multicast scheme.\nIn Xcast, the source node keeps all destinations of the multicast channel through which packets will be sent. The source encodes the destinations list in the Xcast header and sends the packet to a router. Each router looks in a routing table to determine the next hop of each packet, analyzes its header, parses the destination field basing on the following jump of every destination and copies the packets as many different paths as they need to follow. After that, the router copies the packet with its correct Xcast header to every following jump. On the last hop, there is no need to make a new copy, since there is just one address in the destination field. The packet is treated just like a unicast packet, which is called Xcast to Unicast (X2U).\n\nThe IP multicast standard was designed to scale to multicast groups with many members. It works well when doing a distribution similar to broadcasting, but it has scalability problems to a large number of groups. Multicast routing protocols keep routing tables that record multicast group addresses with members. These tables might become large, that prompted alternative schemes to reduce the quantity of state information. IP Multicast protocols announce a source or maintain routes between routers. The cost of these protocols can be significant even then the size of each group is reduced.\n\nXcast follows philosophy that worked well to grow the Internet: keep the center of the network simple, and do the complicated operations on the sides.\n\nAn open source implementation was available from IBM starting in 2001.\nA MediaWiki-based web site (English language, but registered in Japan) indicates activity from 2004 through 2007.\nAn informational specification was published by the Internet Engineering Task Force in November 2007 as RFC 5058.\n\n\nBut on the other hand:\n\nXcast allows efficient applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, or collaborative meetings.\nThese applications could be done using just unicast, but in cases with limited bandwidth, the Xcast efficiency might be useful.\nOn the other hand, since Xcast does not scale to groups with many members, it can not substitute for all other multicast models.\n\n"}

The best way to avoid spillage is by eating the pastry upside down, so that the hard layer of chocolate serves as a bottom. It is also possible (though frowned upon by traditionalists) to use a knife and fork.\n\nEven before the start of the 20th century, a predecessor of the Bossche Bol was being sold in Den Bosch by baker Lambermont, who had a store in a building called \"De Kat\" on the Vischstraat number 61b. The ball made by Lambermont resembled a moorkop and was filled with custard.\n\nIn 1920 a baker from The Hague called Henri van der Zijde took up shop in the same street on number 25 and invented a variation filled with whipped cream and covered with real chocolate, which his heirs see as the first real Bossche Bol.

They are made by baking a white bread dough rolled in dark brown sugar in a spiral shape, lemon zest (rare and only in some parts of the region) and cinnamon. The shape of a bolus differs between bakers. They are often eaten with coffee, and in some parts of the region the flatter underside is covered with butter.\n\nThere is also another kind of pastry that is sold under the name Bolus or \"boles\" in the Netherlands. These are ginger boles, made of dough filled with ginger, and orangeade boles filled with orangeade and almond meal flavoured with orange and almonds. These boles are a golden yellow colour and in a paper form. They have to be eaten with a spoon because the syrup makes them very sticky.\n\nThe bolus was first created in Zeeland in the first half of the 17th century by Sephardic Jewish bakers. There are signs of the Portuguese Jewish community that inhabited Zeeland at the Jewish cemetery in Middelburg. These Jewish bakers created the predecessor of the Zeeuwse bolus. Later bakers from Zeeland perfected the art of the bolus, sometimes using steam ovens to keep the cinnamon pastry tender.\n\nUntil 1998, in baking competitions, boluses were judged as well as bread, cakes and other pastries.\n\nSince 1998, every year during the \"bolus week\", on the Tuesday of the 12th week of the year, the Bolusbaking Championships Zeeland are held, organised by the Dutch Bakery Centre. Participating bakers may get eight boluses judged. A jury consisting of two bakers and two Zeelandia employees chooses the best ten products and the winner is chosen from these by the audience. The winner receives the Bolus Trophy and may call themselves \"Best Bolus Baker\" for a year.

Voordijk from Goes, 2008.\n\nThe bolus is seen as an originally Jewish pastry and has been spread all over the globe during the diaspora. Boluses also get sold in Jerusalem, Moscow and in Paris and the south of France.\n\nThe word bolus comes from Yiddish.

The Finnish Invention Foundation has named it one of the most important Finnish inventions of the millennium.\n\nThe inspiration for the dish drying cabinet was a Swedish dish draining holder, which was kept on the counter. Gebhard noticed that most families never used the holder, but instead dried the washed dishes by hand and put them directly into a cabinet or cupboard. Gebhard's idea was to put the dish draining holder in the cabinet above the dish washing table (sideboard or counter top), so the dishes could drain dry in place. This way, an entire phase of normal household upkeep could be skipped. According to Gebhard's calculations, the average housewife spent almost 30,000 hours of her life washing and drying dishes.\n\nEnso-Gutzeit started producing dish draining closets in 1948. Since 1954, dish draining closets were made of plastic-coated steel wire to help keep them clean. The measurements for the closets were standardised in 1982.\n\nThe cabinets have an open bottom that allows for the water to drain directly into the sink below.\n\n"}

{"id": "25654012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25654012", "title": "Ω-automaton", "text": "Ω-automaton\n\nIn automata theory, a branch of theoretical computer science, an ω-automaton (or stream automaton) is a variation of finite automatons that runs on infinite, rather than finite, strings as input. Since ω-automata do not stop, they have a variety of acceptance conditions rather than simply a set of accepting states.\n\nω-automata are useful for specifying behavior of systems that are not expected to terminate, such as hardware, operating systems and control systems. For such systems, one may want to specify a property such as \"for every request, an acknowledge eventually follows\", or its negation \"there is a request that is not followed by an acknowledge\". The former is a property of infinite words: one cannot say of a finite sequence that it satisfies this property.\n\nClasses of ω-automata include the Büchi automata, Rabin automata, Streett automata, parity automata and Muller automata, each deterministic or non-deterministic. These classes of ω-automata differ only in terms of acceptance condition. They all recognize precisely the regular ω-languages except for the deterministic Büchi automata, which is strictly weaker than all the others. Although all these types of automata recognize the same set of ω-languages, they nonetheless differ in succinctness of representation for a given ω-language.\n\nFormally, a deterministic ω-automaton is a tuple \"A\" = (\"Q\",Σ,δ,\"Q\",\"Acc\") that consists of the following components:\nAn \"input\" for \"A\" is an infinite string over the alphabet Σ, i.e. it is an infinite sequence α = (\"a\",\"a\",\"a\"...).\nThe \"run\" of \"A\" on such an input is an infinite sequence ρ = (\"r\",\"r\",\"r\"...) of states, defined as follows:\n\n\nThe main purpose of an ω-automaton is to define a subset of the set of all inputs: The set of \"accepted\" inputs. Whereas in the case of an ordinary finite automaton every run ends with a state \"r\" and the input is accepted if and only if \"r\" is an accepting state, the definition of the set of accepted inputs is more complicated for ω-automata. Here we must look at the entire run ρ. The input is accepted if the corresponding run is in \"Acc\". The set of accepted input ω-words is called the \"recognized ω-language\" by the automaton, which is denoted as L(A).\n\nThe definition of \"Acc\" as a subset of \"Q\" is purely formal and not suitable for practice because normally such sets are infinite. The difference between various types of ω-automata (Büchi, Rabin etc.) consists in how they encode certain subsets \"Acc\" of \"Q\" as finite sets, and therefore in which such subsets they can encode.\n\nFormally, a nondeterministic ω-automaton is a tuple \"A\" = (\"Q\",Σ,Δ,\"Q\",\"Acc\") that consists of the following components:\nUnlike a deterministic ω-automaton, which has a transition function δ, the non-deterministic version has a transition relation Δ. Note that Δ can be regarded as a function : \"Q\" × Σ → P(\"Q\") from \"Q\" × Σ to the power set P(\"Q\"). Thus, given a state \"q\" and a symbol \"a\", the next state \"q\" is not necessarily determined uniquely, rather there is a set of possible next states.\n\nA \"run\" of \"A\" on the input α = (\"a\",\"a\",\"a\"...) is any infinite sequence ρ = (\"r\",\"r\",\"r\"...) of states that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nA nondeterministic ω-automaton may admit many different runs on any given input, or none at all. The input is accepted if at least one of the possible runs is accepting. Whether a run is accepting depends only on \"Acc\", as for deterministic ω-automata.\nEvery deterministic ω-automaton can be regarded as a nondeterministic ω-automaton by taking Δ to be the graph of δ. The definitions of runs and acceptance for deterministic ω-automata are then special cases of the nondeterministic cases.\n\nAcceptance conditions may be infinite sets of ω-words. However, people mostly study acceptance conditions that are finitely representable. The following lists a variety of popular acceptance conditions.\n\nBefore discussing the list, let's make the following observation. In the case of infinitely running systems, one is often interested in whether certain behavior is repeated infinitely often. For example, if a network card receives infinitely many ping requests, then it may fail to respond to some of the requests but should respond to an infinite subset of received ping requests. This motivates the following definition: For any run ρ, let Inf(ρ) be the set of states that occur infinitely often in ρ. This notion of certain states being visited infinitely often will be helpful in defining the following acceptance conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThe Streett condition is the negation of the Rabin condition. Therefore a deterministic Streett automaton accepts exactly the complement of the language accepted by the deterministic Rabin automaton consisting of the same data.\n\n\n\nEvery Büchi automaton can be regarded as a Muller automaton. It suffices to replace F by F<nowiki>'</nowiki> consisting of all subsets of \"Q\" that contain at least one element of F.\nSimilarly every Rabin, Streett or parity automaton can also be regarded as a Muller automaton.\n\nThe following ω-language \"L\" over the alphabet Σ = {0,1}, which can be recognized by a nondeterministic Büchi automaton:\n\"L\" consists of all ω-words in Σ in which 1 occurs only finitely many times.\nA non-deterministic Büchi automaton recognizing \"L\" needs only two states \"q\" (the initial state) and \"q\". Δ consists of the triples (\"q\",0,\"q\"), (\"q\",1,\"q\"), (\"q\",0,\"q\") and (\"q\",0,\"q\").\n\"F\" = {\"q\"}. For any input α in which 1 occurs only finitely many times, there is a run that stays in state \"q\" as long as there are 1s to read, and goes to state \"q\" afterwards. This run is successful.\nIf there are infinitely many 1s, then there is only one possible run: the one that always stays in state \"q\". (Once the machine has left \"q\" and reached \"q\", it cannot return. If another 1 is read, there is no successor state.)\n\nNotice that above language cannot be recognized by a deterministic Büchi automaton, which is strictly less expressive than its non-deterministic counterpart.\n\nAn ω-language over a finite alphabet Σ is a set of ω-words over Σ, i.e. it is a subset of Σ. An ω-language over Σ is said to be recognized by an ω-automaton \"A\" (with the same alphabet) if it is the set of all ω-words accepted by \"A\".\nThe expressive power of a class of ω-automata is measured by the class of all ω-languages that can be recognized by some automaton in the class.\n\nThe nondeterministic Büchi, parity, Rabin, Streett, and Muller automata, respectively, all recognize exactly the same class of ω-languages.\nThese are known as the \"ω-Kleene closure of the regular languages\" or as the regular ω-languages.\nUsing different proofs it can also be shown that the deterministic parity, Rabin, Streett, and Muller automata all recognize the regular ω-languages.\nIt follows from this that the class of regular ω-languages is closed under complementation.\nHowever, the example above shows that the class of deterministic Büchi automata is strictly weaker.\n\nBecause nondeterministic Muller, Rabin, Streett, parity, and Büchi automata are equally expressive, they can be translated to each other.\nLet us the following abbreviation formula_1: for example, \"NB\" stands for nondeterministic Büchi ω-automaton, while \"DP\" stands for deterministic parity ω-automaton. Then the following holds.\nA comprehensive overview of translations can be found on the referenced web source. \n"}

Its traditional cuisine of each area has individual traits. \n\nTraditionally, the cuisine of Sápmi has been based on local materials, like fish, game, reindeer and berries. Berries have been important food, because other kinds of vegetables were not available during the long winters. Nowadays berries are parts of delicate sauces and desserts. The most valued berry of Sápmi is the cloudberry. Milk consumption varied among groups of Sami, but was not very common in general. \n\nIn eastern parts of Sápmi, reindeer herding became a way of life in the 19th century and, before that, people were hunters and fishers. These days reindeer is essential for Sami cuisine, but game, fish and wild birds are also important. The cuisine of Sápmi consists of a variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate.\n\nReindeer, fish and game meats are staple foods, with thousands of recipes and flavors, although spices other than salt are very rare. The local cuisine varies a lot depending of access to food. Sápmi's history with its many cultural influences has led to an array of dishes. Most dishes are made of reindeer meat, although some also are made of moose or sheep. Smoking and drying have historically been used to preserve meat and fish.\n\nFishes in the mountains and forest areas of Sápmi include Salmon, Common whitefish, Perch, Roach, and Char. Fishes of the coastal areas of Sápmi include Cod.\n\nIn the last decades new influences have been introduced in traditional Sami cooking. A well-known dish of this cross-cooking is the Suovaskebab, which consists of sliced suovasbierggo, cucumber, salad and garlic dressing in a pita bread. The Suovaskebab can be found at festivals and fairs in northern Scandinavia. These days the old food culture is evolving and adapting. Fast food restaurants in Sápmi can have reindeer hamburger on their menus.\n\n"}

It is customary to dip the biscuit in champagne or red wine. The biscuit was created around 1690 in Reims. A baker wanted to make the most of the heat in the bread oven between the two batches, so he had the idea of creating a special dough; cooking it twice, which is where the name \"biscuit\" or \"bis-cuit\" meaning \"cooked twice\" in French. The biscuit initially was white. In order to add flavor to it, a pod of vanilla was introduced into the recipe. This vanilla left brown traces on the biscuit. In order to hide them, the baker decided to add a natural color based on cochineal, a scarlet dye, to disguise his mistake. From this sequence of events, the Biscuit Rose de Reims was born. The biscuit is oblong in shape, and is lightly sprinkled with caster sugar. Enthusiasts for the biscuit included King Charles X, Leopold II of Belgium, the Russian czar, and the Marquise de Polignac.

They are made with baking powder or baking soda as a chemical leavening agent rather than yeast. They are similar to British scones or the bannock from the Shetland Isles.\n\nBiscuits, soda breads, and cornbread, among others, are often referred to collectively as \"quick breads\", to indicate that they do not need time to rise before baking.\n\nAlthough the American English and British English use the same word to refer to two distinctly different modern foods, early hard biscuits (North American: cookies), were derived from a simple, storable version of bread. The word \"biscuit\" itself originates from the medieval Latin word 'biscoctus', meaning \"twice-cooked\".\n\nThe modern Italian baked goods known as biscotti (also meaning \"twice-cooked\" in Italian) most closely resemble the Medieval Latin item and cooking technique.\n\nIn the Hispanic world a bizcocho refers to an array of differing baked goods depending on the country, from Spain and throughout Hispanic America. In the Philippines, a biskotso (also spelled \"biscocho\"), derived from a word used by the Spanish conquerors, refers to a type of garlic bread.\nThe definitive explanation for the differences in the usage of \"biscuit\" in the English speaking world is provided by Elizabeth David in \"English Bread and Yeast Cookery\", in the chapter \"Yeast Buns and Small Tea Cakes\" and section \"Soft Biscuits\". She writes, It is interesting that these soft biscuits are common to Scotland and Guernsey, and that the term biscuit as applied to a soft product was retained in these places, and in America, whereas in England it has completely died out.\n\nEarly European settlers in the United States brought with them a simple, easy style of cooking, most often based on ground wheat and warmed with gravy.\n\nThe biscuit emerged as a distinct food type in the early 19th century, before the American Civil War. Cooks created a cheaply produced addition for their meals that required no yeast, which was expensive and difficult to store. With no leavening agents except the bitter-tasting pearlash available, beaten biscuits were laboriously beaten and folded to incorporate air into the dough which expanded when heated in the oven causing the biscuit to rise. In eating, the advantage of the biscuit over a slice of bread was that it was harder, and hence kept its shape when wiping up gravy in the popular combination biscuits and gravy.\n\nIn 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne patented the first biscuit cutter. It consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on, which was hinged to a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes mounted to it.\n\nSouthern chefs may have had an advantage in creating biscuits. Northern American all-purpose flours, mainly grown in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, are made from the hard spring wheats that grow in the North's cold-winter climate. Southern American bleached all-purpose flours, originally grown in the Carolinas, Georgia and Tennessee before national food distribution networks, are made from the soft winter wheat that grows in the warm southern summer. This summer growth results in wheat that has less protein, which is more suited to the creation of quick breads, as well as cookies, cakes and muffins.\n\nPre-shaped ready-to-bake biscuits can be purchased in supermarkets, in the form of small refrigerated cylindrical segments of dough encased in a cardboard can. These refrigerator biscuits were patented by Ballard and Ballard in 1931.\n\nBiscuits can be prepared for baking in several ways. The dough can be rolled out flat and cut into rounds, which expand when baked into flaky-layered cylinders. If extra liquid is added, the dough's texture changes to resemble stiff pancake batter so that small spoonfuls can be dropped into the baking sheet to produce \"drop biscuits\", which are more amorphous in texture and shape.\n\nLarge drop biscuits, because of their size and rough exterior texture, are sometimes referred to as \"cat head biscuits\". A common variation on basic biscuits is \"cheese biscuits\", made by adding grated Cheddar or American cheese to the basic recipe.\n\nHome cooks may use refrigerator biscuits for a quicker alternative to rolled or drop biscuits. Refrigerator biscuits can even be cooked over a campfire on a stick.\n\nA sweet biscuit layered or topped with fruit (typically strawberries), juice-based syrup, and cream is called shortcake. A type of biscuit called an \"angel biscuit\" contains yeast as well, as do those made with a sourdough starter.\n\nWhile there are many different ways to prepare and top biscuits, the ingredients from recipe to recipe are generally the same. Most recipes will call for all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, either milk or buttermilk, and either butter or shortening (about half will also call for a small amount of sugar as well). The amount of each ingredient will vary for each recipe much the general concept is the same for these simple baked goods.\n\n"}

In creating his biscuit, Abernethy was following a trend of other medical practitioners like English William Oliver of Bath, Somerset (invented the Bath Oliver) and the American preacher Sylvester Graham who was a nutrition expert (the Graham cracker).\n\nThe Abernethy biscuit is an adaptation of the plain captain's biscuit or hardtack, with the added ingredients of sugar (for energy), and caraway seeds because of their reputation for having a carminative (prevents flatulence) effect making them beneficial in digestive disorders.

Following the Battle of White Mountain, in 1624, the city of Brno was forced to pay a special charge per beer, called \"\"pivní tác\"\". After the successful defense of the city against Swedish sieges in 1645, Brno was allowed to levy the charge for its own purposes.\n\nIn 1782, the convent was closed by decision of emperor Joseph II, and the property passed to the hands of St Thomas's Abbey. There is no evidence of the existence of the brewery between 1782 and 1825, as the archives were destroyed.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century in the Czech lands was marked by expansion of the brewing industry. The outdated equipment and the low capacity of the \"Old Brno\" brewery were insufficient for increasing demands of the rapidly growing city. The last owners of the original brewery, Josef Mandel and his son-in-law Herrmann Hayek therefore decided to build new, representative and modern brewing buildings. In 1872, the company \"Mandel a Hayek\" began construction of a new brewery on \"\"V hlinkách\"\" street. The buildings of the former brewery were used to construct a new malt-house. In the last decade of the 19th century, the brewery merged with another brewing company, located in Brněnské Ivanovice. The production was moved to the new capacities in \"Old Brno\". At the end of the 19th century, the annual production of the consolidated brewery was 236,490 hectoliters.\n\nUp to the beginning of World War I, the company managed to overtake a major part of the competitors on the market in Brno, and production grew to 250,000 hectoliters yearly. The beer from Brno was exported to Poland and Austria–Hungary; the brewery supplied Vienna market with five wagons of beer daily. The owners of the company in that time were Germans; the first Czech shareholders came to the brewery only in 1911.\n\nIn 1918, after the establishment of the new Czechoslovak State, the brewery passed into the hands of \"Moravian Bank\". The import of the beer focused more on the Slovak market. The business activities of the company reached their highest level around 1927, however, the subsequent Great Depression caused a short decline for the brewery. The final result of the weak years was positive, \"Starobrno Brewery\" managed to beat its main rival on the market, \"Moravia Brewery\".\n\nDuring the World War II, the company was led by Germans. The brewery suffered damages during the bombing of Brno in November 1944, and was subsequently heavily damaged by passing front.\n\nThroughout the second half of the 20th century, the brewery has been modernized on several occasions. Its modern history dates from 1992, when the structure of the brewery changed to a joint-stock company. The same year, it was awarded first prize in the beer exhibition PIVEX. In 1994, \"Starobrno\" became a part of the Austrian concern BBAG (Österreichische BrauBeteiligungs AG). The merger between BBAG and Heineken Group in 2003 allowed for the establishment of the most important brewing company in Middle Europe.\n\nIn 2009, Starobrno Brewery produced more than one million hectoliters of beer, for the first time in its history.\n\nStarobrno produces these different brands of beer in regular production, all beers are unpasteurised:\n\nAside from its standard production, the brewery produces a special batch of green beer, which is produced only once per year and distributed on Maundy Thursday. The Czech term for this Christian holiday is \"Green Thursday\" (\"\"zelený čtvrtek\"\") and the unusual color of the beer is inspired by this feast.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25892158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25892158", "title": "Child Jesus images in Mexico", "text": "Child Jesus images in Mexico\n\nThe Niño Dios (literally Child God) of Mexico is a tradition of venerating the Child Jesus in Mexico which has taken root from the time it was introduced in the 16th century and then syncretized with pre-Hispanic elements to form some unique traditions. Mexican Catholics have their own images of the Child Jesus, which is honored and celebrated during the Christmas season, especially on Christmas Eve and on Candlemas (2 February). One tradition unique to Mexico is to dress the image in new clothing each year for presentation at Mass on Candlemas. This dress can vary from representations of the saints, Aztec dress, football/soccer players and more. Also, there are Niño Dios images which are locally famous and honored year-round.\n\nVeneration of the Child Jesus is a European tradition with the best-known examples being the Infant Jesus of Prague and the Santo Niño de Atocha. This\ntradition was brought by the Spanish to Mexico after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire; In Mexico this veneration has taken on indigenous elements, and is considered to be one of the most deeply rooted Catholic traditions in Mexico. Part of the reason for this was that native Mexicans already had traditions of representing deities in painting or sculpture with rites dedicated to that incarnation, including dramatizations. One of the oldest traditions related to the Child Jesus in Mexico is the “pastorela,” a dramatization based on the birth of Jesus. The “Adoración de los Reyes Magos” (The Adoration of the Magi) was probably the first “pastorela” in Mexico which was organized by Friar Andrés de Olmos. It was written in Nahuatl and there were adaptations to indigenous culture in the script as well. The tradition of reenacting scenes from the birth of Christ was recognized by Juan de Zumárraga, the first bishop of New Spain who ordered that this practice be widespread for evangelization. Very early on, these reenactments began to vary by local custom and region and were most frequently done by the lower classes. The main theme of these works is the journey of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem, but demons try to get in their way. In most versions, the demons are vanquished by the Archangel Michael or another angel and the Wise Men arrive to their destination. Characters most often include shepherds, demons, angels and the Wise Men. Other characters sometimes appear such as Mary and Joseph, Indians, ranchers and monks. At the end of the play, all kiss the image of the infant Jesus.\n\nVeneration of the Christ child is strongest during the Christmas season, which officially begins a week or so before Christmas Eve (with posadas) and ends on Candlemas, 2 February. On Christmas Eve, the figure of the Christ child is laid into the Nativity scene in a celebration which is done in the home. This event is called “put the child to bed.” The figure is carried by one or more of the young women while the rest of the family sings lullabies or other children’s and/or Christmas songs. Each member of the family kisses the image as they sing. The figure is laid in the manger, where it stays until the second of February.\n\nThis ceremony varies by family and by community. For example, in the community of Dzitnup, in the municipality of Valladolid, the Maya people here have their own variation. In addition to the laying the child in the manger, there is a dance called “Abraham and Isaac.” This dance includes people who play the two main characters as well as devils. The dance is accompanies by a pre-Hispanic wind instrument called a “tunkul,” which is similar to the “teponatli” used in other states such as Guerrero and Puebla.\n\nAnother Christmas Eve tradition is for children to write letters to the Christ child, typically to ask for things like toys and clothes.\n\nCandlemas (in Spanish, Candelaria), 2 February, marks the end of the Christmas season and nativity scenes generally remain intact in the home until this date. Preparation for Candelaria can begin on 6 January, known as \"Three Kings Day\". On this day, a ring-shaped sweet bread called a Rosca de Reyes is shared. Inside the Rosca, is one or more miniature figures of an infant are hidden. Those who find these figures have obligations to meet on Candelaria. These obligations always include being responsible for buying tamales and drinks for this day, but it can also signal a more serious commitment. It can mean that the person selected must purchase an outfit for the family’s Niño Dios for one, two or three years. The person may also need to buy an outfit for the found miniature infant.\n\nEach year, the Niño Dios of the household is brought to Mass on 2 February to be blessed. After the mass, the family returns home to celebrate, typically with tamales, buñuelos, atole and hot chocolate. The tradition recalls that forty days after Jesus’s birth, Mary and Joseph took the child to the Temple to present to the priests.\n\nTo present the Niño Dios at Mass, tradition states that the image must be dressed in a new outfit. These outfits can vary widely but a number are most popular. For those who observe the three year commitment, the image is dressed in white for the first year, symbolizing purity. This is also the case if the image being presented is new. Other common and traditional outfits include Santo Niño de Atocha with crosier and seated on a chair, “Niño de las palomas” (Child of the doves) in a white robe with a dove between the hands, as San Francisco with sandals and brown robe, holding an animal, or “Niño de las azucenas” (Child of the lilies) with a white tunic and holding a bunch of lilies.\n\nThe need to buy a new outfit each year has given rise to a market in outfits for the images. Purchase of the outfits generally begins as early as December and continues until 2 February. Outfits range from the very simple made with inexpensive fabrics to elaborate creations in silk. The most common outfits are made with silk, satin, cotton and brocades decorated with silver or gold. Stationery stores generally sell the most traditional of outfits and the more expensive ones. However, these outfits are most commonly bought in traditional open markets called “tianguis.” Here, more original ones can be found and can include various saints, pre-Hispanic dress, mariachis, soccer players and ethnic dress of various nationalities. Custom orders are also taken. Some priests frown upon the non-traditional outfits and only want white. Many of the outfits are original and some cause scandal, such as the Niño Dios dressed as a drug trafficker.\n\nAt the Casa de Cultura Griselda Alvarez in Mexico City, there was an exhibit of twenty four Niños Dios dressed in various ways: as a fisherman, as the Pope, as the Archangel Gabriel, as the Sacred Heart and as the Atocha. The collection is from the La Casa de los Niños Dios Uribe. The images vary and size from very small to very large and in material, mostly being of ceramic or wood.\n\nIn addition to the veneration of household Niños Dios during the Christmas season, there are a number of Child Jesus images that have year-round devotion. These Niños Dios often have a special place in the worship by Mexican Catholics, but sometimes they have been the objects of “kidnapping” and disputes. Most of the best-known images are in Mexico City and central Mexico. Offerings to these images are usually toys or candy, a tradition related to offerings made to the dead for the afterlife in pre-Hispanic times.\n\nOne of the earliest of the Niño Dios images in Mexico is the Niño Cautivo which is in the Metropolitan Cathedral. It was sculpted in the 16th century by Juan Martinez Montañez in Spain and purchased by the cathedral. However, on its way to Veracruz, pirates attacked the ship it was on and sacked it. To get the image back, a large ransom was paid. Today, the image is in the Chapel of San Pedro or De las Reliquias.\nTraditionally, the image has been petitioned by those seeking release from restrictions or traps, especially financial problems or drug addiction or alcoholism. The cult to the Niño Cautivo is considered to be “inactive” by INAH. However, this particular image has made a comeback since 2000 as one to petition when a family member is abducted and held for ransom.\n\nAnother famous Niño Dios is the Niñopa (also written Niño-Paor Niñopan) of Xochimilco, which is also from the 16th century. This image originally belonged to an indigenous chief called El Viejo. The name “Niño Pa” is a hybrid of the Spanish word for “child” (niño) and the Nahuatl word for “place” (pan) meaning “child of the place.” It is said that this image goes about at night to visit people in their dreams and to check the crops of the community. Some claim to have found mud on the image’s shoes in the morning.\n\nThis image has been housed in one family’s home or another for over 430 years. The host family who become its “godparents” or mayodomos for the year. To be a “godparent” for this image is a great honor in Xochimilco, with the list extending until 2035 with families waiting fifty years. The family prepares a special bedroom in their home to house the child for the year. Those families who have housed the image in past years have replicas of the Niño Pa.\n\nIt is claimed that this image made itself invisible when government soldiers came to claim it during the Cristero War. It was presumed that the image was made of orange tree wood because of the writings about it by Martín Serón y Alvarado. However, this was proven false in the 1970s, when the image was dropped and a finger broke off. It is made the wood from a tree called “chocolín” in the workshops of Bernardino of Siena in the 16th or 17th century.\n\nThe Niño de las Suertes has a strong following due to its association with Santa Muerte. While the image was created in the 19th century, its popular veneration is a recent phenomenon. The image was found by two evangelists in the rubble of the Hacienda of San Juan de Dios in Tlalpan. It was handed over to Archbishop Francisco Lizana y Beaumont. As a number of monasteries wanted to claim it, the archbishop decided to make the decision by lottery. It is said that this image favored the Convent of San Bernardo due to the vow of poverty by its nuns. This was confirmed by doing the drawing three times. In the 19th century, due to tensions between the Mexican government and the Church, the image was moved to Tacubaya when the convent was secularized. This image has a skull by the infant's head. This originally symbolized the future Passion, but recently it has made this image associated with Santa Muerte, whose devotees visit.\n\nIn Tacuba, there is on image called the Niño Futbolista (Child Football/Soccer player) although its real name is \"Santo Niño de los Milagros.\" It is considered to be generous in granting miracles and is in a glass case surrounded by toys given by the faithful to favors received. Every four years, when the FIFA World Cup is played, this image is dressed in the uniform of the Mexico national football team, in the hopes that Mexico wins the cup.\n\nThe Santo Niño Doctor de los Enfermos is at a side altar in the parish of San Francisco de Asís en Tepeaca, Puebla. The image is old but devotion to it is relatively recent. The image used to belong to a nun of the Concepción Béistegui Hospital in Mexico City. When the nun was transferred to Tepeaca, she brought the image with her and had it with her as she treated the sick. This image has had its own feast day at this church since 1961 on the 30 of April.\n\nOther locally famous Niños Dios in Mexico City include the Niño Limosnerito in Colonia Santa Maria la Ribera, the Santo Niño del Verbo Encarnado in Colonia Alfonso XIII, and the Santo Niño Muevo Corazones in Colonia Santa Tomás. This last image is credited with the conversion of many people to Catholicism. Outside of Mexico City, there are the Niño Jesús de la Salud in Morelia, the Niño Milagroso de Tlaxcala, the Niño Cieguito (Blind Child) in Puebla (so called because it lacks eyes) and the Santo Niño de Atocha in Fresnillo, the lasat a local version of a Spanish depiction.\n\n"}

It has a high content of magnesium. It helps with constipation problems, heartburn and magnesium deficiency problems.\n\nDonat Mg was first commercially available in 1908, but the history of Rogaška Slatina springs is much older. Excavation in the area confirmed Celtic and Roman settlements, indicating that the spring was in use in ancient times.\n\nThe first owner of the springs was the parish of the nearby village Sveti Križ, and the first written records about the springs date back to 1141, when the mineral water spring was cited in a document as a boundary point in a property transaction. The first known analysis of the water was carried out in 1572.\n\nIn 1670 Paul de Sorbait, Habsburg court physician and professor at the Medical Faculty of Vienna, introduced the water to the court and soon after several other physicians in Vienna and elsewhere in the empire began to prescribe to their patients various therapies with the water. The wells gained much popularity 1665 when the count Petar Zrinski promoted their healing powers. The hospital in Graz even tested it as a clinical medicine. During this time, the first inn by the springs was built in 1676 by Baron Peter Courty. In 1685 the physician Johann Benedikt Gründel from Maribor published the first scientific monograph \"Roitschocrene\" about the Rogaška mineral water (also called slatina).\n\nIn the early 17th century Emperor Leopold I gave the distribution rights to several important citizens of Vienna. In 1721, Emperor Charles VI assigned the sale rights to the Association of Viennese Pharmacists which retained these rights until 1782. Then a period of regression followed as far as the development of Rogaška was concerned, as Emperor Joseph II dissolved the Association of Pharmacists, and ownership fell into the hands of the local owners.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Styrian provincial governor, Count Ferdinand Attems, begun a major campaign for the purchase of land around the Rogaška springs. His intention was supported by the general public and physicians of the empire as he wanted once and for all to prevent uncontrolled and unsafe use of springs and develop a modern, provincial-run spa. The works begun in 1801 and in 1869 the Rogaška water became the third most sold worldwide water immediately after the mineral water from French Vichy and German Selters. It was possible to purchase the water in all of the Austrian provinces, in Italy (Aqua di Cilla), Greece and also in Egypt. It even won a prize at the World's Columbian Exposition - World Exhibition in Chicago in 1893.\n\nSince that time, tourism has been the major player in the area. Several hotels were built in the period of rapid growth between 1840 and 1860, and the new railway line Vienna-Trieste (1857) made the resort more accessible. The resort hosted many illustrious visitors, including members of the royal and ruling families (Habsburg, Bonaparte, Hohenzollern, Bourbon, Obrenović), members of high nobility (Esterhazy, Thurn und Taxis, Della Grazia, Furstenberg, Windischgraetz, Liechtenstein) and many other important guests, including Bishop Strossmayer, English traveler Richard Francis Burton, writer Bertha von Suttner and others. Several celebrities put in regular appearances too, such as the composer Franz Liszt who entertained the guests.\n\nIn 1908, a highly mineralized water spring was discovered by a team under the leadership of the geologist and inspector of the Karlovy Vary spa, dr. Joseph Knett. This mineral water was given the name DONAT. During the wars, this part of Slovenia became a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Rogaška, as the most luxurious and modern resort in the entire territory, attracted the new elite, the government and military authorities and industrial moguls. Following the Second World War, new wells were found under the guidance of Professor Bać from Sarajevo and in collaboration with the Geological Institute in Ljubljana. This drilling signified a new beginning with regard to research and methods of capturing underground water in Slovenia. Up to the present time, the comprehensive geological, hydro-geological and geophysical research was carried out at Rogaška Slatina under the guidance of Professor Bać and Anton Nosan from the Geological Institute in Ljubljana. On the basis of the positive results of this research, quite a few wells were drilled for the capture of mineral water and CO2 gas which ensured a sufficient supply of mineral water, of type Donat Mg (and Tempel), to the Health Spa Resort and its Bottling Complex.\n\nAfter Slovenian independence, the resort fell into disuse due to privatization, but it is now back on its feet, still reflecting its glorious past with many 19th century buildings lining the central promenade. Today Rogaška Slatina has several hotels Hoteli Rogaška, health resort Terme Rogaške, Spa park and several other facilities.\nDonat Mg is a brand name registered by the company Droga Kolinska (located in Ljubljana) which is in turn owned by Atlantic Grupa and also produces Slovenia's best known soft drink, Cockta. Today, Donat Mg is distributed in various European countries.\n\nMineral contents\n\nThe recommended amount is 500 ml per day.\n\nBecause of its hyperosmolarity, Donat Mg is a natural osmotic laxative. It is classified as a saline laxative.\n\nIts effectiveness as a laxative is due to sulphate salts (magnesium sulphate or Epsom salt and sodium sulphate or Glauber’s salt) and around 1000 mg/l of magnesium. Sulphates draw water from the cells of the intestinal wall by osmosis, increasing the volume of intestinal content 3 to 5 times; this exerts pressure on the intestinal wall and triggers its peristalsis or movement. Magnesium also additionally stimulates the intestinal hormones that boost peristalsis.\n\nThe stomach makes 2 to 3 litres of acidic fluids each day. These consist mostly of hydrochloric acid and pepsin (an enzyme that speeds up the metabolism of proteins). Donat Mg contains approximately 7,800 mg of hydrogen carbonate. This high hydrogen carbonate content has a great capacity for bonding to acids and buffering free acids. It bonds to stomach acid in equal amounts.\n\nTherefore, Donat Mg is a natural replacement for medicines against excess stomach acid.\n\nMagnesium is one of the most important minerals and is essential for good health.\n\nThe amount of an element as important as magnesium is carefully regulated by the body. If cells begin to lack magnesium, the body replaces it from its own stores – from the bones and the liver. If the balance of magnesium is negative, the following general signs of deficiency quickly become apparent: constipation, loss of appetite, feeling unwell, fatigue, low energy, muscle spasms, pins and needles, irritability, sleep disorders, headaches, poor concentration and psychological changes.\n\nExperts have determined that the recommended daily dose of magnesium for adults is 375 mg that means that 0,3-0,4 litres of Donat Mg natural mineral water is enough to satisfy the recommended daily allowance of magnesium.\n\nThe clinical study conducted by the analyze & realize GmbH Institute from Berlin, Germany, has scientifically proven that Donat Mg is effective in stimulating digestion. The study was performed in accordance with all the professional codes of conduct governing the clinical trial of medicinal products. The study covered a sample of subjects with constipation problems based on clinical parameters. After six weeks, the subjects who consumed Donat Mg experienced three times more frequent bowel movement than the subjects from the control group. During the study, more than 94% of trial subjects and 97% of investigators stated that Donat Mg was effective, well tolerated and that it had improved their quality of life. For safety and effectiveness assessment of Donat Mg natural mineral water with regard to bowel function was conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial.\n\n"}

This tidbit is a piece of pale green marzipan, with dark green netting, filled with a chocolate ganache flavored with curaçao liqueur.\n\nDuring the plague epidemic in 1643, the aldermen of Lyon made the vow to organize a procession at Fourvière to implore the Virgin Mary to save the city. They carried a seven-pound candle of wax and a gold crown on a silk cushion. This gave the chocolatier , based in Lyon since 1897, the idea of using the shape of the cushion to create this confection in 1960. It has become the most popular French specialty confection containing chocolate ganache.\n\nThis delicacy has become very popular. It is possible to buy the \"cushions\" individually, and also in velvet boxes which recall the original form of silk cushion.\n\nThe Boucaud family has a monopoly in marketing the \"coussins\", which it makes in its network of retail stores across the Rhône-Alpes region and in Marseille. The manager of the company Voisin, Paul Boucaud, says that the company manufactures eighty-five tons of coussins of Lyon a year and that production increases by 10% annually.

There are various vegetarian versions of the dish in which wheat gluten is substituted for tripe. Other variations use strong-tasting fish such as tuna. The traditional Ecuadorian recipe is served hot and accompanied by potatoes and a peanut sauce.\n\nThe dish is often considered an acquired taste. Because of its strong taste, it is sometimes served in small quantities.\n\nIn Ecuador, it is believed that guatita helps relieve hangover symptoms. For this reason, it is often served by restaurants early on Saturday and Sunday mornings.\n\n\n"}

The technique is typically found in the Spanish region of Catalonia and Valencia and subsequently Catalan cuisine and Valencian cuisine. It is not an autonomous sauce like mayonnaise or romesco, but it is added as a seasoning during the cooking of a recipe.\n\nOften the preparation of a concoction begins with another essential sauce, like the sofregit, and ends with the final adding of the picada some minutes before the cooking termination. Picada is used to blend and thicken juices, to provide an excellent finishing touch to a multitude of recipes: meats, fish, rice, soups, legumes, vegetables. There are many variants for the rest of ingredients. The most common ones are garlic (so often it is considered almost essential), saffron (considered essential too by many cooks), and / or parsley (yet another regular appearance too). Other possible ingredients used more rarely are cinnamon, cooked liver (of chicken or rabbit), chocolate, cummin, herbs and other spices.\n\nThe picada is prepared in the mortar and must contain a basic triad: almond, bread and some liquid. Almonds are toasted and can be replaced by another nut like hazelnut, pinenut, walnut, or some combination of those. Hard, dry bread is crushed on the mortar, that is, toasted or stale, or bread crust, or fried in oil on the pan, or even some sort of sweet biscuit or cookie. The liquid used is usually the cooking juice but stock or hot water can be used as well.\n\nHistorically, picada of almonds is documented in Catalan cuisine from its very beginning. It is already present in the oldest medieval treatises. Other neighboring Mediterranean cuisines, as Occitan or Italian ones have essentially similar sauces such as pesto.\n\nIn Argentina \"Picada\" is a presentation of cold cuts such as ham, cured ham, pepperoni, sausages, Pates; several types of cheeses such as blue cheese, pecorino, parmiggiano and more. Normally served with dips, bread, olives and nuts.\n\n"}

The soil is semi arid and semi-humid ideal for Agave Azul Tequilana Weber.\n\nThe soil is abundant with minerals such as copper, iron, potassium and silica, which produces sweet Blue Agaves, the ideal agaves for Casa Dragones.\n\nIn May 2013, Wine Enthusiast rated Tequila Casa Dragones Joven a 96/100 – the magazine’s highest tequila rating, saying, “The end result is extraordinarily smooth, with a very sweet, fruity, almost wine-like nose but a bold, pure peppery flavor that finishes cleanly” \n\nIn November 2010, Casa Dragones won the Grand Prix Stratégies du Luxe, a product and packaging design award for luxury brands. This was the first time a Mexican brand and a tequila had won this award.\n\nCasa Dragones received praise from Oprah Winfrey when she named Tequila Casa Dragones her favorite tequila in an interview with Facebook Live, as well as on an Oprah’s Favorite Things Holiday Television Special.

The chain cited its popularity in overall sales, as well as videos of people eating the Double Down becoming a YouTube sensation. Stephen Colbert ate one on \"The Colbert Report\", spurring the item's popularity even more.\n\nKFC Australia started selling the Double Down (renamed The Double) with the tagline \"make time for mantime\" on March 30, 2011, for a limited time only. The Double was successful in Australia, although it was criticized for being unhealthy. KFC Australia announced via their Facebook page that if they reached 500,000 likes, they would bring the Double back to Australian stores for a limited time period of two days. The page reached 500,000 likes on June 15, 2012, and KFC announced that the Double would go on sale on June 27 and 28. The Double reappeared on menus in December 2012, again for a limited time only.\n\nFrom May 10, 2011, the Double Down was available in New Zealand for an initially limited period of five weeks.

This was in response to an online campaign launched by Australian Facebook page 'Yeah the Boys'.\n\nNPR compared its calorie count to that of McDonald's Premium Crispy Chicken Club Sandwich. Both the grilled and fried Double Down products have nearly a full day's worth of sodium according to the American Heart Association's guidelines. A \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewer pointed out that the grilled chicken Double Down has fewer calories and less fat than the fried chicken Double Down (460 versus 540 calories, and 23 g versus 32 g fat) but that the grilled chicken option has more sodium (1,430 mg versus 1,380). The \"L.A. Times\" article also noted that both Double Downs have fewer calories than Burger King's TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, which has 800 calories.\n\nFrom its April 12, 2010 nationwide launch through early July, a KFC spokesperson reported that the chain had sold 10 million units for a total of about US$50 million in revenue. An analyst said that figure accounts for 5% of KFC's sales in that time period, a figure insubstantial to KFC's financial bottom line.\n\nIn Canada, the Double Down became KFC's best-selling new menu item ever, selling over 350,000 units in less than 10 days. Despite sales in excess of one million units, KFC Canada discontinued the Double Down in 2010, reviving it again for a short period in 2011. In August 2015, KFC Canada brought back the Double Down for a small period of time. Sales in New Zealand were 600,000 units over its five-week promotion. Grant Ellis, CFO of New Zealand KFC operator Restaurant Brands, said that despite these sales the Double Down \"did cannibalise some of our better-margin products.\"\n\nFollowing the launch of Zinger Double Down in Korea, the overall sales for KFC Korea increased by 20%.\n"}

It is usually wrapped in banana leaves and served with side dishes.\n\nThis rice dish is a type of nasi rames or nasi campur — terms used for dishes that have rice and a variety of side dishes.\n\nNasi bogana is very popular in Indonesia and is sold all over the streets of Jakarta, the capital city, for 12,000 to 20,000 rupiah each. It is sold in almost all Sundanese or Javanese restaurants and sometimes in \"warungs\" or \"wartegs\" (\"Warung Tegal\"), a traditional outdoor restaurant or café. It is considered a convenient dish as it is wrapped in banana leaves and is usually ready to bring and eat any time. It is a type of fast food that is brought to workplaces to eat.\n\nNasi bogana is prepared by spreading a wide banana leaf and filling it with steamed rice. Then seasoning such as fried shallots are put on top of the rice. Over the rice, a smaller banana leaf is spread and the side dishes — \"opor ayam\" (white chicken curry), \"dendeng\" (shredded meat), fried chicken liver and gizzard in chili and coconut gravy, \"sambal\" of shredded red chili, \"telur pindang\" whole boiled eggs, \"serundeng\" (fried shredded spiced coconut with peanuts), sautéed \"tempeh\" or sautéed string beans — are decoratively placed. All ingredients are then wrapped and closed with the outer banana leaf that is placed over the rice. Plastic strings are used to tighten the pack together. It is put in a steamer to keep it warm and is ready to eat at any time.\n\nOther times they are prepared as a regular rice dish without the banana leaves because the dish has been too common and restaurants do not follow the traditions.\n\nThe \"opor ayam\" is usually served as pieces without their bones. This is usually done because they can wrap it in banana leaves easier without taking too much space. There are two types of \"opor ayam\": white gravy, commonly used in West Java, and yellow gravy, commonly used in Central Java. Both are sweet but yellow \"opor ayam\" tends to have curry spices in it.\n\nThe \"dendeng\" is sometimes put in a stick and eaten the same way as a satay (meat in skewer). The \"telur pindang\" boiled eggs are most of the time cut in half and only half is served. This depends on the occasion. \"Serundeng\", fried chicken liver and gizzard in chili and coconut gravy (suggested to use cow livers rather than chicken to avoid the smell), \"sambal\" of shredded red chili and sautéed tempeh and sautéed string beans is served regularly, a spoon-full of each circling the steamed rice.\n\nIn Java, nasi bogana is often used in special occasions, such as weddings and anniversaries, but is most commonly found in family gatherings and social gatherings (arisan). At weddings, nasi bogana usually has its own booth where people can choose their own side dishes and sauces. Most people prefer nasi bogana to be eaten with \"kerupuk\" (Indonesian flour crackers) or \"emping\" (crushed bean crackers from \"melinjo\"), and as a result it becomes a part of the side dish. Some people like additional sauce like \"Kecap manis\" (sweet soybean sauce) and \"sambal terasi\" (fish and shrimp chili sauce). The drink that they have while having this dish is most of the time hot or iced black tea.\n\nNasi bogana contains amounts of protein and carbohydrates from the meat and rice, but also contains a lot of fat and oil since it uses coconut and palm oils in the side dishes. Almost all of the side dishes are prepared by frying.\n\nThe dish ranges from 1000-1600 calories per serving. It is comparable with fast food.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26131703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26131703", "title": "Antebellum architecture", "text": "Antebellum architecture\n\nAntebellum architecture (meaning \"prewar\", from the Latin \"ante\", \"before\", and \"bellum\", \"war\") is the neoclassical architectural style characteristic of the 19th-century Southern United States, especially the Deep South, from after the birth of the United States with the American Revolution, to the start of the American Civil War. antebellum architecture is especially characterized by Georgian, Neo-classical, and Greek Revival style plantation homes and mansions.\n\nExterior: The main characteristics of antebellum architecture viewed from the outside of the house often included huge pillars, a balcony that ran along the whole outside edge of the house to offer shade and a sitting area, evenly spaced large windows, and big center entrances at the front and rear of the house to add to the box-like style of the mansion. These mansions also often included grand gardens with geometrically cut bushes to complement the symmetry of the house.\n\nInterior: The interior of these mansions were just as extravagant as the outside. Common features included enormous foyers, sweeping open stairways, ballrooms, grand dining rooms, and intricate design work. The design work included intricate shapes and patterns made from plaster used to adorn walls and furniture. It was also used to create wood and floor designs. \n\nMany plantation houses still standing are of this style, including:\n\nThe features associated with antebellum architecture were introduced by people of British descent who settled in the Southern states during the colonial period and in U.S. territories after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 along with a wave of immigration from Europe in 1812. Great numbers of Europeans seeking economic opportunities emigrated to America after Napoleon's defeat and the end of the war of 1812. This new wave of entrepreneurs began to dominate not only the economy, but also the architecture of the first half of the 19th century.\n\nA prime example of the influence of immigrants in antebellum architecture is Stanton Hall. The Hall was built by Frederick Stanton, an immigrant from Ireland who made his fortune in trading cotton. The design was based on the Revival style. The Hall also goes to show the increasingly connected national and global economy in which antebellum architecture emerged. The house used mantel pieces from New York, gasoliers from Philadelphia, and mirrors from France. Similar to many antebellum homes, Stanton Hall was built using a fortune Stanton made trading cotton. During the Civil War, like many other plantation houses, the Hall was occupied by Union soldiers.\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson's home the Hermitage is another prime example of both antebellum architecture and the social conditions in which it arose. It was built in the Federal style, which while losing favor in the more trendy East was still popular in Western slave states like Tennessee. Later, renovations made the house more in line with contemporary stiles, adding Doric columns and making it more Classical and Revivalist in appearance. Not just reflecting the cultural differences between the West and East in this time, the Hermitage also was part of the South's slave-based economy. The Hermitage was an active plantation which grew the period's dominant cash crop, cotton. By the time of his death, Andrew Jackson owned 150 slaves who lived and worked at the Hermitage.\n\nAfter the Civil War, many antebellum houses were gradually converted from family homes into private schools. Many of these homes were supported either by plantation slavery or by other businesses supported by slavery, so with the end of slavery often came the end of the financial means of supporting such lavish buildings. Stanton Hall, for example, was owned by the descendants of Stanton for several decades after the Civil War, but eventually the financial burden was too much and it became the Stanton College for Young Ladies. \n\nToday most antebellum buildings serve as museums. These museums, especially the museums located at former plantations, often attempt to show both sides of the architectural style. While celebrating the beauty of the buildings, they also tell the story of the slaves who worked the land. Boone Hall is a prime example of modern antebellum museums. The museum uses nine of the original slave cabins built between 1790 and 1810 as part of its \"Black History in America\" exhibit. In the exhibit, each cabin presents different aspects of slave life on the plantation. While the style's history remains controversial, exhibits like these are important in exposing the public to America's history with slavery.\n\nThe debate over whether or not to preserve antebellum Homes is an ongoing one. Some argue that because these lavish homes were built from fortunes created through slavery, oppression, and cruelty it is not ethical to preserve them because they serve as a reminder of American slavery. Others argue that because these homes have historical significance they should be maintained. Movies like \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"12 Years a Slave\" are examples of antebellum homes portrayed in pop culture and many antebellum homes today even serve as tourist attractions.\n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the South and damaged or destroyed many antebellum buildings. This destruction once again raised the question of whether or not these buildings, as symbols of a wealthy society propped up by slavery, should be preserved or not. For example, Grass Lawn, an antebellum mansion in Gulfport, Mississippi, was totally destroyed by the hurricane. As the community began to raise funds to rebuild the mansion, it faced resistance from parts of the community who opposed the symbolism of the mansion. Though it eventually passed through city council, the bill funding the reconstruction was at first even voted down. \n\nMany prime example of antebellum architecture did not receive the same support as Grass Lawn. In the wake of Katrina, cleanups of cities often did not follow the guidelines of the National Historic Preservation Act. Hundreds of properties were destroyed with little hope of being reconstructed or commemorated.\n\n"}

The hat (to be worn with a European-style coat and trousers) was cylindrical with a peak, being based on the French military kepi, and was available in black or beige. The hat's peak, by obstructing the touching of the forehead to the ground during prayer, was seen as an attempt to reduce the influence of religious ritual in Iranian society (although unlike brimmed European hats it could be turned around for prayer), while its introduction across the whole of society served to efface distinctions in dress amongst different ethnic groups (the Armenians in particular objected to being made to wear it).\n\nAlthough widely adopted in cities, the Pahlavi hat was initially perceived as 'foreign' and proved deeply unpopular. European observers were also unimpressed with the hat; Robert Byron, who adopted one as a disguise while visiting a mosque, commented that it made the wearer look like a \"decayed railway porter\". Despite this, the Pahlavi hat had become widespread by the 1930s.\n\nAt the Tenth Majlis in June 1935, it was announced that the Pahlavi hat would be replaced by the fedora, a conventional European-style hat. This, along with other innovations introduced by Reza Shah's government, provoked mass demonstrations in July in the city of Mashhad, which were suppressed by the army, resulting in many deaths.\n\n"}
{"id": "26161560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26161560", "title": "Futanari", "text": "Futanari\n\nBeyond Japan, the term is used to describe a commonly pornographic genre of eroge, comics, and anime which includes characters that show both primary sexual characteristics. In today's language it refers almost exclusively to characters who have an overall feminine body, but have both female and male genitalia (although testicles are not always present). In that case, the term is also often abbreviated as \"futa(s)\", which is occasionally also used as a generalized term for the works itself.\n\nJapanese folk religion created diverse fantasies related to sexual characteristics. Traditional vocal pieces that date back hundreds of years deliver rough evidence that a change of gender was not ruled out and that the representation of the gender was used to worship deities such as \"dōsojin\" which sometimes had ambiguous gender, being neither male nor female. Leupp adds that the origins might even reach back to the origins of Buddhism, since the deities would not necessarily have a fixed or determinable gender.\n\nLikewise the belief spread that some people could change their gender depending on the lunar phase. The term was coined to describe such beings. It is assumed that traditional clothing, which made it more difficult to distinguish men from women like in other cultures, might have had an influence on this development. To restrict women from accessing prohibited areas and to avoid smuggling by hiding items in the belt bag, guard posts were assigned to perform body checks. In historical records, it can be seen that guards liked to joke about this matter quite frequently, resulting in various stories and even poems. Whether anatomical anomalies, like clitoromegaly or unusual physical development, led to these assumptions remains an open question.\n\nUntil 1644, when onnagata actors were required to adopt male hairstyles regardless of the gender they were portraying, actors playing characters like female warriors capitalized on the interest in the \"futanari\" quality, which was common in both samurai and commoner society.\n\nOriginally the Japanese language referred to any character or real person that possessed masculine and feminine traits as \"futanari.\" This changed in the 1990s as drawn futanari characters became more popular in anime and manga. Today, the term commonly refers to fictional (drawn), female looking, hermaphrodite characters. \"Futanari\" is also used as the term for a specific genre within hentai related media (pornographic anime or manga) that depicts such characters.\n\nTo differentiate between fictional characters and real trans women, the Japanese language adopted the English-style term , which is used for the latter.\n\nFutanari manga became popular in the 1990s and quickly became a pervasive part of the industry, cross-pollinating with multiple genres. Toshiki Yui's \"Hot Tails\" has been described as the best known example of the genre in the West.\n\nIn anime aimed at a broad audience, the gender bender or cross-dressing storylines have always been popular. Popular examples include anime such as \"Ranma ½\", \"Kämpfer\", and \"Futaba-Kun Change!\" (in which the main character changes from male to female), and \"I My Me! Strawberry Eggs\" (which takes on a more cross-dressing theme).. The light novel series and anime series \"Wagaya no Oinari-sama\" (\"Our Home's Fox Deity.\") features a female fox deity who often appears as a male human.\n\n"}

It aids in applying the foundation more evenly and smoothly, and increases the longevity of the foundation. Some contain antioxidants such as A, C, and E, or other ingredients such as grape seed extract and green tea extract. There are water-based and silicon-based foundation primers. Ingredients may include cyclomethicone and dimethicone. Some primers do not contain preservative, oil or fragrance. Some may also have sun protection factor (SPF). Some foundation primers are tinted to even out or improve skin tone or color. Others give a pearlized finish to make the complexion more light reflective. There are also foundation primers which are mineral-based primers, which contain mica and silica.\n\nEyelid or eye shadow primers are similar, but made specifically for use near the eyes. An eyelid primer may help even the color of the lid and upper eye area, may reduce oiliness, may add shimmer, or inversely may mattify. Eye primers aid in the smooth application of eye shadow, prevent it from accumulating in eyelid creases, and improve its longevity. \nEye shadow primers are applied to the eyelid and lower eye area prior to the application of eye shadow. They even out the skin tone of the eyelids hide eyelid veins, and smooth out the skin of the eyelids. Eye shadow primers help with the application of eye shadows. They intensify the color of the eye shadows and keep them from smearing or creasing by reducing the oiliness of the lids. Some eye shadows even state in the instruction sheet, that they are recommended for usage over the eye shadow primer. There is a real difference in the eye shadow color and time of wear when it is used over the primer on bare skin. The effect of eye shadow primers is not limited to eye shadows. They also work for eye liners and eye shadow bases. \n\nMascara primer is sometimes colorless. It usually thickens and/or lengthens the lashes before the application of mascara for a fuller finished look. It may also help keep mascara from smudging or flaking, and some claim to improve the health of the lashes.\n\nLip primers are intended to smooth the lips and help improve the application of lipstick or lip gloss, although exfoliating the lips is often recommended before applying. They also are intended to increase the longevity of lip color, and to prevent lipstick from \"feathering\", that is, smearing past the lip vermilion, and especially from migrating into any fine lines around the lips.\n\n"}

The strips are drained of excess oil. A sugar glaze is made of granular sugar, a trace of salt for flavor, and water that is heated to just short of the hard ball stage over medium-low heat and then poured over the fried sweet potatoes. The strips are then separated, placed on a rack, and allowed to drain of any excess sugar until cool. The sugar sauce typically sugars as it glazes due to having been disturbed while hot or due to introduction of sugar crystals while cooling. Because of the high sugar content, once cooled, the kenpi must be immediately stored in sealed bags or containers to maintain crispness.\n\nVariations include different varieties of sweet potatoes, inclusion of the skin, different amounts of salt in the sugar mixture, different additional flavorings (e.g. ginger), and different sugar sauce preparation methodologies (i.e. fudge, sugared glaze, clear glaze, and caramelization).

All the ingredients it needs are diced mango, sliced pomelo, sago, coconut milk, evaporated milk and milk. First, boil the sago while blending mango, coconut milk, evaporated milk and milk in the blender. When the sago begins to float and turns transparent, rinse it for later use.

{"id": "26220200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26220200", "title": "Igapó", "text": "Igapó\n\nIgapó (, from Old Tupi: \"root forest\") is a word used in Brazil for blackwater-flooded forests in the Amazon biome. These forests and similar swamp forests are seasonally inundated with freshwater. They typically occur along the lower reaches of rivers and around freshwater lakes. Freshwater swamp forests are found in a range of climate zones, from boreal through temperate and subtropical to tropical.\nIn the Amazon Basin of Brazil, a seasonally whitewater-flooded forest is known as a várzea, which is similar to igapó in many regards; the key difference between the two habitats is in the type of water that floods the forest.\n\nIgapó is primarily characterized by seasonal inundation caused by abundant rainfall; in some areas, trees can be submerged for up to 6 months of the year. These ecosystems are relatively open and feature over 30% canopy cover with an average canopy height ranging from 20–25 m; sparse measurements of trees can reach 33–36 m. Tree composition includes a varied mixture of leaf types and seasonality. Development of tree communities within the freshwater swamp forests rely heavily on microtopography and flooding intensity. Swamp forests can have harsh environments, in which only a few adapted species are able to sustain life or dominate over other tree species. One of the tree species mostly found in freshwater swamp forests are legume trees, in which most swamp forests have high single legume species populations. Legume trees in these forests are thought to be abundant in nitrogen fixation, which is most common in waterlogged locations and is thought to be a favorable trait when experiencing seasonal and/or constant waterlogging.\n\nFreshwater swamp forests can be classified into two categories of forested wetlands, which are permanently and periodically flooded forests. It is possible to find these two types because of the high microtopographic variation. Due to these topographic differences, tree communities are delimited and have a distribution over small continuous areas.\n\nThese forests may be able to sustain a large number of bird, mammal, reptile, amphibian, fish and invertebrate species, however, biodiversity varies between wetland ecosystems and the species richness of the freshwater swamp forests is not entirely known. As for plant species, these forests have a lower diversity compared to other types of forests, such as the terra firme, in South America.\n\nIgapó forests are characterized by sandy acidic soils that have a low nutrient content. The color and acidity of the water is due to the acidic organic humic substances (e.g. tannins) that dissolve into the water. The acidity from the water translates into acidic soils. They are the more nutrient poor than a comparable várzea forest. They also “carry less suspended inorganic elements and contain elevated concentrations of dissolved organic material such as humic and fulvic acids”. Therefore, igapó forests support comparatively less life and the environment found within these areas tend to lack species diversity and animal biomass. Várzea forest soils have high nutrient contents because they receive a transport of high sediment loads from the whitewater rivers. In contrast, igapó forests do not receive this seasonal influx of sediments which explains the nutrient poor soils. However, they do have the highest phosphorus concentrations out of comparable várzea and terra firme forest soils. Nevertheless, the seasonal inundation of the soils leads to anoxic conditions which limits plant growth.\n\nIgapó and other flooded forests typically display a lower diversity of plants than that seen in terra firme forests. Similar to other forests found throughout the tropics, it is common to observe only a few dominant tree species Distribution of trees and other plants is highly dependent on inundation tolerances of species causing a non-random distribution of plants where more flood-tolerant species are found at lower elevations and less flood-tolerant species are found on higher ground.\nFabaceae (or Leguminosae) and Euphorbiaceae are the dominant families of plants observed in igapó forest.\n\nTree species adapted to seasonal inundation have adapted to maximize fruit production during periods of flooding in order to take advantage of newly available seed dispersal methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and monkeys is secondary to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of seed predators. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in characins, such as catfish, digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are bottom-feeders, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.\n\nDiversity of terrestrial wildlife and fishes in igapó is highly influenced by flooding. During periods of inundation, vast numbers of aquatic species migrate into the flooded forest in search of food. Fish populations are highest during maximum fruiting periods and river dolphins and giant otters move in to prey upon them. Compared to terra firme forests, Igapó features lower nutrients and favors slow-growing plants with low fleshy fruit production, which has resulted in a lower diversity and abundance of animals.\nLarger terrestrial mammals have varied strategies of dealing with flooding: red brocket deer and collared peccaries move into islands and shift diet from fruit to browsing woody plants. White-lipped peccaries and tapirs are largely unaffected by seasonal inundation; both species take advantage of the greater abundance of fruit during these times. White-lipped peccaries migrate between flooded and dry areas and tapirs are highly capable swimmers.\n\nArboreal mammals such as monkeys tend to be lower in species richness compared to terra firme forests due to the decrease in tree diversity and the resulting lack of variety of suitable food types. A lower population density of birds also reflects the lack of nutrients found in igapo forests. For example, within Jaú National Park, 247 species of birds are found in \"terra firme\" forests; 121 of those species are limited to that habitat. Within neighboring igapó forests, 194 species of birds are found; of those, just 58 are restricted to igapó.\n\nNative Amazonians have been using and modifying the forests in which they have lived for thousands of years. Several studies suggest that the presence of nutrient-rich \"black earth\" in typically nutrient-poor igapó environments indicates intense fertilization and burning of these areas. Black earth is a modified soil characterized by high nutrient content from highly stable organic matter and high levels of phosphorus.\nThe highly fertile soils and the openness of these areas confirm that the native Amazonians have been using these fields for agriculture.\n\nHowever, the Amazonians have not only used these areas for crops; they have used their agricultural lands as a place to hunt as well. Many animals (rodents, tapirs and deer) are attracted to these areas for food. The Amazonians produce a surplus so that the animals do not over-consume their food resource. Though, if the animals do start to deplete their crops, they will then harvest higher numbers of animals. Additionally, Amazonians consume fish as a main source of protein. Indigenous peoples understand that, while flooded, the forest serves as an essential feeding ground that increases fish abundance. Because of this, many protect igapó forests from deforestation.\n\nThe greatest threat to igapó forests is the construction of hydroelectric dams on tributaries of the Amazon river; when constructed, the dams will divert huge amounts of water and dramatically change the hydrology of the Amazon basin and its ecosystems. Because many flora within seasonally inundated forests are highly adapted to a particular flooding schedule, alterations in flood patterns and the creation of permanently flooded areas will induce higher rates of tree mortality. The loss of these trees will likely affect populations of frugivorous understory birds, such as the blue-throated piping guan and some \"Amazona\" parrots that are restricted to igapó. Loss of habitat will cause migrations of species that will inevitably lead to higher competition in unaffected habitats and possibly local extinctions. \n\nDeforestation is also a large conservation concern because Igapó forests are characterized by slow tree growth due to low soil nutrient content and high soil acidity. Despite low nutrient availability, Igapó and other floodplain forests can be biodiverse with some partially endemic species. Due to soil chemistry and seasonal inundation, trees and other resources tend to grow back more slowly after harvest by humans than in other types of Amazonian forests, . Accordingly, igapó forests cannot sustain timber harvest. For the future, igapó forests should be fully protected from logging and deforestation because of the low productivity found in them.\n\nIn protected areas, such as Jaú National Park, the lack of indigenous inhabitants and a low population of rural families limits the potential for over-harvest of fish and turtle species. However, enforcement of harvest regulation is problematic when there are only three park rangers at the entrance to the park. In other unprotected areas that lack rangers, unregulated harvest of fauna by peoples that move into igapó forests to hunt and fish may adversely affect future stocks. Approximately 3% of the Amazon's seasonally inundated forests are under protection within national parks or biological reserves.\n\nFreshwater swamp forests are distributed in multiple climate zones throughout the world, such as boreal, temperate, tropical and subtropic zones. They are found in the Afrotropics, Australasia, Indomalaya, and the Neotropics. However, they are most notably found in Amazonian areas.\n\n\nIgapó forests are one of the distinct natural communities found in the Cantão State Park. They offer a rich bird fauna that includes some habitat specialists due to the unique ecosystem the blackwater inundation provides. The trees in the igapó bloom once the inundation season begins. They do this so they can drop their fruit into the water to be dispersed by the different fish taxa.\n\n\nThe Jaú National Park was designated in 1980 and is the largest national park in the Amazon Basin and the second largest protected tropical forest. It is known for its high level of biodiversity and varying ecosystems within. The park protects the entire watershed of the Jaú River, which happens to be one of the best examples of a blackwater ecosystem where the water is colored by acidic decomposing organic matter.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26296206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26296206", "title": "Sponge cake", "text": "Sponge cake\n\nSponge cake is a cake based on flour (usually wheat flour), sugar, butter and eggs, and is sometimes leavened with baking powder. Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain. The sponge cake is thought to be one of the first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in a book by the English poet Gervase Markham, \"The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman\" (1615). Still, the cake was much more like a cookie: thin and crispy. Sponge cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the mid 18th century. The Victorian creation of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843 enabled the sponge to rise higher than cakes made previously, resulting in the Victoria sponge.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a sponge cake is produced using the batter method, while in the US cakes made using the batter method are known as butter or pound cakes. Two common British batter-method sponge cakes are the layered Victoria sponge cake and Madeira cake. \nCakes made using the foam method are not classed as sponge cakes in the UK; these cakes are classed as foam cakes, which are quite different. These cakes are common in Europe, especially in Italian patisseries. The cake was first invented by the Italian pastry chef Giovan Battista Cabona (called Giobatta), at the court of Spain with his lord, the Genoese marquis Domenico Pallavicini, around the middle of the 16th century.\n\nVariations on the theme of a cake lifted, partially or wholly, by trapped air in the batter exist in most places where European patisserie has spread, including the Anglo-Jewish \"plava\", Italian génoise, the Portuguese pão-de-ló, and the possibly ancestral Italian \"pan di Spagna\" (\"Spanish bread\"). Derivatives of the basic sponge cake idea include the American chiffon cake and the Latin American tres leches cake.\n\nThe essential ingredients are eggs, fat (often butter), sugar, and flour. An authentic British sponge cake is made by first mixing the fat with the sugar and then beating the eggs with the sugar-fat mix until the mixture is light and creamy, then carefully sieving and folding in the flour. Depending on the recipe, the flour may be mixed with a small amount of baking powder though some recipes use only the air incorporated into the egg mixture, relying on the denaturing of the egg proteins and the thermal expansion of the air to provide leavening. \nIn the French version the yolks are beaten with the sugar first while the whites are beaten separately to a meringue-like foam, to be gently folded in later. The mixture is then poured into a cake tin and baked. \nBoth methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages.\n\nBefore the cooked cake has cooled, it is still flexible. This allows the creation of rolled cakes such as the Swiss roll. This basic recipe is also used for many treats and puddings, such as madeleines, ladyfingers, and trifles, as well as some versions of strawberry shortcake; the earliest recipe for shortcake is in an English cookbook from 1588. In addition, the foam cake technique is used in angel food cake (where only egg whites are used) and some recipes for Belgian waffles (where the egg whites are separated from the yolks and folded into the batter at the end of preparation).\n\nThe Victoria sponge, also known as the Victoria sandwich or Victorian cake, was named after Queen Victoria, who was known to enjoy a slice of the sponge cake with her afternoon tea. The sponge part evolved from the classic pound cake – equal quantities of butter, sugar, eggs and flour. The difference was the Victorian creation of baking powder, which was discovered by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, which enabled the sponge to rise higher. This invention, writes cookery author Felicity Cloake, \"was celebrated with a patriotic cake\", Victoria sponge.\n\nA typical Victoria sponge filling consists of strawberry jam and whipped double cream (thick cream with a high fat-content). The jam and cream are sandwiched between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated apart from a dusting of icing sugar. The Women's Institute publishes a variation on the Victoria sandwich that has strawberry jam as the filling and is dusted with caster sugar, not icing sugar.\n\nA Victoria sponge is made using one of two methods. The traditional method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. \n\nBoth the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture one of the most popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic \"cake\" mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding. \n\nAlthough simple to make, Victoria sponge recipes are notoriously sensitive to cooking times and temperatures. As such, oven manufacturers often use a Victoria sponge recipe to test their ovens. Competitive Victoria sponge baking is part of the classic British fête.\n\nSince sponge cakes are not leavened with yeast, they are popular dessert choices for the Passover feast. Typically, Passover sponges are made with matzo meal, shredded coconut, matzo flour, potato flour, or nut flour (almond, hazelnut etc.) since raw wheat products may not be used. No raising agent may be used due to the strict prohibition of even the appearance of a leavening effect. Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover sponge recipe. Many families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppy seeds. Apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the Seder service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit compote.\n"}

A high-visibility version of the ball was developed, in orange with a red and yellow pattern.\n\nThe ball features an outer layer made from Clarino microfibres and composed of 26 panels, as opposed to the 32-panel designs used by Adidas and Nike amongst others. It is claimed that the 26-panel design allows the ball to maintain its spherical shape better, with the seam pattern also allowing for more accurate control over the flight of the ball. Mitre also claim that this control is further enhanced by the ball's polyurethane coating – which keeps the ball dry and provides better grip between boot and ball – and its PVC inner layers – which transfer the momentum from the player's foot to the ball with greater efficiency. The design on the ball's surface is based on thermal images of global wind patterns.\n\n"}

It is also popular in Jersey and France. The title of the dish is French, \"moules\" meaning mussels and \"frites\" fries, with the Dutch name for the dish meaning the same. It is considered the national dish of Belgium.\n\nAlthough \"moules-frites\" are popular in France and around the world, it is thought that the dish originated in Belgium. It is likely that it was originally created by combining mussels, a popular and cheap foodstuff eaten around the Flemish coast, and fried potatoes which were commonly eaten around the country in winter when no fish or other food was available. On their own, french fries are also closely associated with Belgian cuisine by many Europeans. Although Belgium claims to be the birthplace of french fries, their origin is uncertain and several other countries also claim the title.\n\nThe ways in which the mussels are cooked in the dish can vary significantly. Some variants commonly seen are:\n\nLess commonly, fusion variants are seen in which the stock may be flavoured with non-local ingredients such as Espelette pepper or Pernod liquor. They can also be served with \"\"Mosselsaus\"\", a sauce that is made with mayonnaise, mustard and vinegar. In Belgium, the moules used are generally farmed in nearby Zeeland in the Netherlands.\n\nIn various forms, \"frites\" or \"friet\" play an important role in Belgian culture and cuisine. Within Belgium, bintje potatoes are generally preferred as a basis to make fries because of their high starch content. They are generally double-fried (fried, left to cool and then fried again) in order to make them both moist in the core and crispy on the outside. As a part of this, they are often fried at a particularly high temperature (around ).\n\nAs a dish, the \"moules\" and the \"frites\" are usually served on separate plates or dishes so that the fries do not become moist. Often, the moules are served in the same pan and stock used to cook them. A second pan or dish is generally also provided in which the mussels' shells can be left once the mussels themselves have been eaten.\n\nAccording to a French nutritionist, the optimum quantity of mussels is one litre, considering their nutritional value and Omega 3 content, but not more than of fries. This quantity contains between 500-600 calories.\n\nIn both Belgium and France, \"moules-frites\" are available in most restaurants. According to a survey conducted by TNS, \"moules-frites\" was identified as the second favourite dish in France, receiving a vote of 20 percent, narrowly losing to magret de canard which received 21 percent. On average, between 25 and 30 tonnes of moules are consumed each year in Belgium as \"moules-frites\".\n\nThe Belgian musician, Stromae, performed a song entitled \"Moules frites\" in his 2013 album, \"Racine carrée\".\n\n\n"}

It was popular in cookbooks of the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nCookbook authors such as Xavier Raskin (1922) have suggested that the dish was French in origin, but in the United States it occurs in cookbooks as early as 1857, and in Scotland as early as 1862. In 2004, the American \"Good Housekeeping\" cookbook referred to the dish as \"classic\", a status reinforced by its occurrence in such famous cookbooks as Isabella Beeton's \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" and Christian Isobel Johnstone's \"The Cook and Housewife's Manual\". While the \"simple\" and \"homely\" dish is found frequently in cookbooks that feature inexpensive foods, such as the 1898 \"Practical Cookery Manual of Plain and Middle Class Recipes\", it is also featured in \"The White House Cookbook\" by Hugo Ziemann, who was a White House steward.\n\nFor many years, liver was quite inexpensive in the United States, as many Americans were not interested in it. As Americans became more cosmopolitan in their tastes, they learned to appreciate new dishes. This trend, combined with the discovery of the health benefits of iron-rich liver, caused an increase in demand for, and the price of, liver.\n\nFor some restaurants, liver and bacon was a signature dish: in 1925, the Homestead Room in St. Petersburg, Florida, took out a full-page ad praising its calf's liver and bacon. The dish is so hearty that \"The New York Times\" suggested it as a good food for winter, a season when \"the body demands more fuel and we turn to heavier dishes.\" It was the favorite food of Charlie Finley, owner of the Oakland A's.\n\nSlices of bacon are fried and slices of calf liver (often covered in flour) are sauteed in the rendered fat. The bacon and slices of liver are placed in a dish and covered with a gravy made with the fond. Many recipes call for the liver to be scalded first.\n\nIt is imperative that the dish be served quickly, as the liver ought to be eaten when hot and tender. Besides at dinner or supper (Mrs Beeton suggests it \"aux fines herbes\" as an entree in a copious meal), one finds calf's liver and bacon as a breakfast meat also, for instance in the Sherwood hotel in Florida, 1903.\n"}

Its ingredients include jaggery (unrefined cane sugar), rice, poppy seed and ghee (clarified butter).\n\nAnarsas are made from soaked powdered rice, jaggery or sugar. The rice is soaked in water for 3 days, with the water changed daily to mitigate fermentation. The rice is then dried, retaining a minimal amount of moisture, and ground into a fine powder. This is known as the \"pithi\", and is mixed with an equal amount of sugar.\n\nThis mix can be stored for a long time at room temperature as long as it is sealed in an airtight container to prevent the moisture from soaking the sugar further. Whenever Anarsas are to be prepared, mash half inch piece of banana and mix into the previously prepared dough-balls. The banana ensures the sugar dissolves so be careful not to mix too much of banana. The resultant dough should be very soft yet retain shape. Small flat discs with about 2 inches in diameter are created by flattening a small ball of the dough over a layer of poppy seeds - just on one side. These disks are fried with poppy coated side first into hot ghee.\n\nThe Bihari version of anarsa tends to be rounder and ball shaped as opposed to the flatter one in Maharashtra.\n\nAnarsa is a pastry like snack commonly consorted with the Hindu festival celebrated for five successive days. Fry the Anarsa in the Ghee with the poppy seeds side up on medium flame or else the Anarsa will break. Keep on splashing ghee over the upper side of the Anarsa with the ladle without disturbing the Anarsa. Remove the Anarsa and drain the ghee by placing Anarsa in an upright position on the flat area. Anarsa is made from soaked powdered rice, jaggery or sugar. The poppy seeds side of the Anarsa will have a kind of a mesh on it once it is blown. Keep pouring the warm oil on the center of the anarsa so that it gets uniformly brown.\n\nIn a variation from the standard recipe, banana is added to rice flour base. Another variation uses curd use in rice flour to make a spongy anarsa. Sprinkling Castor sugar on top of gives the anarsa a powdery appearance .\n"}

Rupjmaizes kartojums is similar in appearance and construction to the trifle of the British Isles, and is often called Sweet Rye Trifle, or Latvian Ambrosia among English speakers. It uses Rupjmaize dark rye bread rather than sponge cake. Rupjmaizes kartojums is an iconic Latvian food, and is considered a treasure of the national cuisine. It was the sweet chosen to represent Latvia in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.\n\nLatvian Dark Rye, the base of the dessert, is not the same as other types of rye bread popular in Western Europe and North America. These are typically mixed with a large proportion of wheat and flavored with caraway and/or other spices and flavourings, whereas Latvian Dark Rye is all rye and unspiced.\n\nRupjmaizes kartojums is prepared in a clear glass, trifle dish or parfait glass by first spreading a thin layer of jam or preserves on the bottom of the dish, then adding a thick layer of lightly sweetened vanilla-flavoured whipped cream, which is then in turn sprinkled with a layer of dark rye bread crumbs. These layers are repeated up to the top of the dish, when a final dollop of cream and sprinkling of the rye crumbs are added to enhance the dessert's appearance.\n\nAn authentic rupjmaizes kartojums is made using the traditional Latvian dark rye bread, giving the finished dish a uniquely Baltic/Scandinavian flavour profile. The bread is finely grated and may be pan toasted. It is then flavoured with cinnamon and sugar. Swedish or Russian dark rye breads, and failing this, a dark pumpernickel, are sometimes used in preparing this dessert by expats where Latvian bread is not available.\n\nRaspberry, strawberry and apricot are favourite preserves for preparing Rupjmaizes kartojums among Latvians, as are the more peculiarly Latvian aronia, sea buckthorn, lingonberry, rose hip and red currant varieties.\n\nAfter preparing the dessert it is chilled thoroughly, since, over the course of several hours, the flavours of the individual ingredients meld, the rye crumbs soften and absorb fruit and cream liquids, and the dessert acquires a more cohesive texture. Fresh fruit is often added to the top of the dessert as a festive garnish to match or compliment the jam variety used just before serving the dish.\n\n"}

For \"chicken cordon bleu\" chicken breast is used instead of veal. \"Ham cordon bleu\" is ham stuffed with mushrooms and cheese.\n\nThe French term \"cordon bleu\" is translated as \"blue ribbon\". According to Larousse Gastronomique cordon bleu \"was originally a wide blue ribbon worn by members of the highest order of knighthood, L'Ordre des chevaliers du Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henri III of France in 1578. By extension, the term has since been applied to food prepared to a very high standard and by outstanding cooks. The analogy no doubt arose from the similarity between the sash worn by the knights and the ribbons (generally blue) of a cook's apron.\"\n\nThe origins of cordon bleu as a schnitzel filled with cheese are in Brig, Switzerland, probably about the 1940s, first mentioned in a cookbook from 1949. The earliest reference to \"chicken cordon bleu\" in \"The New York Times\" is dated to 1967, while similar veal recipes are found from at least 1955.\n\nThere are many variations of the recipe, all of which involve a cutlet, cheese, and meat. A popular way to prepare chicken cordon bleu is to butterfly cut a chicken breast, place a thin slice of ham inside, along with a thin slice of a soft, easily melted cheese such as Swiss. The chicken breast is then rolled into a roulade, coated in bread crumbs and then deep fried. Other variations exist with the chicken baked rather than fried.\n\nOther common variations include omitting the bread crumbs, wrapping the ham around the chicken, or using bacon in place of ham.\n\nA variant popular in the Asturias province of Spain is \"cachopo\", a deep-fried cutlet of veal, beef or chicken wrapped around a filling of Serrano ham and cheese. In Spain, the version made with chicken is often called \"san jacobo\".\n\nIn largely Muslim-populated countries, the halal versions of chicken cordon bleu are also popular, such that the chicken is rolled around beef or mutton instead of pork product.\n"}

Outside Mexico, it often refers specifically to \"mole poblano\". In contemporary Mexico, the term is used for a number of sauces, some quite dissimilar, including black, red/colorado, yellow, green, almendrado, de olla, huaxmole, guacamole, and pipián. Generally, a mole sauce contains a fruit, chili pepper, nut, and such spices as black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, and chocolate.\n\nTwo states in Mexico claim to be the origin of mole: Puebla and Oaxaca The best-known moles are native to these two states, but other regions in Mexico also make various types of mole sauces.\n\nMoles come in various flavors and ingredients, with chili peppers as the common factor. However, the classic mole version is the variety called \"mole poblano\", which is a dark red or brown sauce served over meat. The dish has become a culinary symbol of Mexico’s mestizaje, or mixed indigenous and European heritage, both for the types of ingredients it contains and because of the legends surrounding its origin.\n\nA common legend of its creation takes place at the Convent of Santa Clara in Puebla early in the colonial period. Upon hearing that the archbishop was going to visit, the convent nuns panicked because they were poor and had almost nothing to prepare. The nuns prayed and brought together the little bits of what they did have, including chili peppers, spices, day-old bread, nuts, and a little chocolate. They killed an old turkey, cooked it and put the sauce on top; the archbishop loved it. When one of the nuns was asked the name of the dish, she replied, \"I made a mole.\" \"Mole\" was the ancient word for mix; now this word mostly refers to the dish, and is rarely used to signify other kinds of mixes in Spanish.\n\nA similar version of the story says that monk Fray Pascual invented the dish, again to serve the archbishop of Puebla. In this version, spices were knocked over or blown over into pots in which chicken were cooking. Other versions of the story substitute the viceroy of New Spain, such as Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in place of the archbishop.\nModern mole is a mixture of ingredients from North America, Europe and Africa, making it one of the first intercontinental dishes created in the Americas. Its base, however, is indigenous. Nahuatl speakers had a preparation they called \"mōlli\" (), meaning \"sauce\", or \"chīlmōlli\" () for chili sauce. In the book \"General History of the Things of New Spain\", Bernardino de Sahagún says that mollis were used in a number of dishes, including those for fish, game and vegetables. Theories about the origins of mole have supposed that it was something imposed upon the natives or that it was the product of the baroque artistry of Puebla, but there is not enough evidence for definitive answers. Coincidence or not, the word \"mōlli\" seems to resemble the Portuguese word \"molho\", which means \"sauce\".\n\nWhile chili pepper sauces existed in pre-Hispanic Mexico, the complicated moles of today did not. They did not contain chocolate, which was used as a beverage, and in all of the writings of Sahagún, there is no mention at all of it being used to flavor food. Most likely what occurred was a gradual modification of the original molli sauce, adding more and different ingredients depending on the location. This diversified the resulting sauces into various types. Ingredients that have been added into moles include nuts (such as almonds, peanuts, or pine nuts), seeds (such as sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, or squash seeds), cilantro, seedless grapes, plantains, garlic, onions, cinnamon, and chocolate. However, most versions do not contain cinnamon or chocolate. What remained the same was the use of chili peppers, especially ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle, and the consistency of the sauce. The true story of how mole developed may never be truly known, as the first recipes did not appear until after the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. The Nahuatl etymology of the name probably indicates a Mesoamerican origin.\n\nAll mole preparations begin with one or more types of chili pepper. The classic moles of Central Mexico and Oaxaca, such as \"mole poblano\" and \"mole negro\", include two or more of the following types of chili pepper: ancho, pasilla, mulato and chipotle. Other ingredients can include black pepper, \"achiote\", \"guaje\" (\"Leucaena leucocephala\"), cumin, cloves, anise, tomatoes, tomatillos, garlic, sesame seeds, dried fruit, herbs like Piper Auritum or \"hoja santa\" , also known as hierba santa , and many other ingredients. \"Mole poblano\" has an average of 20 ingredients; mole almendrado has an average of 26, and Oaxacan moles can have over 30. Chocolate, if used, is added at the end of cooking. According to Rick Bayless, the ingredients of mole can be grouped into five distinct classes: chiles, sour (tomatillos), sweet (dried fruits and sugar), spices, and thickeners (nuts and tortillas).\n\nThe ingredients are roasted and ground into a fine powder or paste. This roasting and grinding process is extremely laborious and takes at least a day to accomplish by hand. Traditionally, this work was shared by several generations of women in the family, but after the arrival of electric mills, it became more common to take the ingredients to be ground. Many families have their own varieties of mole passed down for generations, with their preparation reserved for special events in large batches.\nThe resulting powder or paste is mixed with water, or more often broth, and simmered until it is pungent and very thick. It is most often prepared in a \"cazuela\" () or a thick heavy clay cauldron and stirred almost constantly to prevent burning. The thickness of the sauce has prompted some, such as Mexican-food authority Patricia Quintana, to claim it is too substantial to be called a sauce. However, like a sauce, it is always served over something and never eaten alone. \"Mole poblano\" is most traditionally served with turkey, but it and many others are also served with chicken, pork, or other meats (such as lamb).\n\nA number of mole powders and pastes can be prepared ahead of time and sold, such as \"mole poblano\", \"mole negro\", and \"mole colorado\". Many markets in Mexico sell mole pastes and powders in packages or by the kilogram. These mole mixes are heavy with a strong odor, so much so that security agents at the Mexico City airport once admitted that mole can register a positive when they check for explosives.\n\nPrepared mole sauce will keep for about three days in the refrigerator and it freezes well. The paste will keep six months in the refrigerator and about a year in the freezer. Leftover sauce is often used for the making of tamales and enchiladas (often called \"enmoladas\") or over eggs at brunch.\n\nThe term mole is most often associated with thick, dark, brownish-red sauces, but the term is really more general than that. Mole can be anything from dark and thick to soup-like and bright green, with red, yellow and black moles each claiming fans in different regions.\n\n\"Mole poblano\" is the best known of all mole varieties and has been ranked as number one of \"typical\" Mexican dishes. It has also been called the \"national dish\" of Mexico. The state of Puebla is identified with \"mole poblano\". \"Mole poblano\" has been described as an ancient dish.\n\n\"Mole poblano\" contains about 20 ingredients, including chili peppers and chocolate, which works to counteract the heat of the chili peppers, but the chocolate does not dominate. It helps give the sauce its dark color, but this is also provided by the mulato peppers. This sauce is most often served over turkey at weddings, birthdays and baptisms, or at Christmas with \"romeritos\" over shrimp cakes. The sauce is also served with chicken, pork, or other meats. Another time when the sauce is prominent is Cinco de Mayo. While this holiday is not celebrated much in the rest of Mexico, it is a major celebration in Puebla.\n\nThe state of Oaxaca is large and very mountainous with various indigenous ethnicities and microclimates, making for a number of regional variations in the food. The state is called \"the land of the seven moles\", with these being named \"mole negro, colorado, amarillo, verde, chichilo, coloradito\", and \"mancha manteles\" (or tablecloth stainer), all differently colored and flavored, based on the use of distinctive chilis and herbs. The last, \"mancha manteles\", is a chicken and fruit stew, and although Oaxaca claims it as the seventh mole, some, such as Susan Trilling in her book \"My Search for the Seventh Mole: A Story with Recipes from Oaxaca, Mexico\", question whether it is a true mole. In addition, those from Puebla claim this dish as their own.\n\nThe best known of Oaxaca's moles is \"mole negro\", which is darker than \"mole poblano\" and just as thick and rich. It also includes chocolate, as well as chili peppers, onions, garlic and more, but what makes it distinct is the addition of a plant called \"hoja santa\". It is the most complex and difficult to make of the sauces. \"Mole coloradito\" is another popular preparation, often simplified and sold as an enchilada sauce. \"Mole verde\" is always made fresh with herbs native to the region.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, San Pedro Atocpan, located in the mountains south of Mexico City proper (but still part of the Federal District) was similar to the other agricultural communities surrounding it, growing corn, fava beans and \"nopales\" (prickly pear cactus). Electricity and other modern conveniences arrived late, allowing the community to retain more of its traditions later.\nIn 1940, Father Damian Sartes San Roman came to the parish of San Pedro Atocpan and saw the potential in marketing the product to raise living standards in the area. At that time, only four neighborhoods prepared mole for town festivals: Panchimalco, Ocotitla, Nuztla and Tula, but those who prepared it were generally prominent women in their communities. In the 1940s, one family made the long trek to Mexico City proper to sell some of their mole at the La Merced Market. It was successful, but they brought with them only two kilograms since it was made by hand grinding the ingredients on a \"metate\". The arrival of electricity in the late 1940s made the use of a powered mill possible, and better roads made the trek to the city easier. Some of these mills were bought or financed by Father Sartes, but the mole was still cooked in a clay pot over a wood fire. In the 1970s, he was part of a small group which became a cooperative, which constructed the Las Cazuelas restaurant. This is where the first Mole Exhibition was held in 1978.\n\nThe care and tradition that went into the moles from there made them popular and made the town famous in the Mexico City area. Today, San Pedro Atocpan produces 60% of the moles consumed in Mexico and 89% of the moles consumed in Mexico City, with a total estimated production of between 28,000 and 30,000 tons each year. Ninety-two percent of the town's population makes a living preparing mole powders and pastes, all in family businesses. Prices for mole run between 80 and 160 pesos per kilogram, depending on the maker and the type. A number of moles are made in the town, but \"mole almendrado\" (mole with almonds) is signature to the area. Producers in Atocpan have their own versions of the various types of mole, often keeping recipes strictly secret. The production in the town has become very competitive, especially in quality. Twenty-two brands are permitted to print \"Made in San Pedro Atocpan\" on their labels.\n\nVarious types of mole sauces can be found throughout the center of Mexico toward the south. There is the \"mole amarillito\" of the southeast, the \"mole coloradito\" of the Valley of Mexico (as opposed to the mole of the same name in Oaxaca), the \"mole prieto\" of Tlaxcala, \"mole ranchero\" from Morelos, and more. Taxco has a pink version of mole, called \"mole rosa\". The spiciness of this version is very mild. The word \"guacamole\" (avocado sauce) is derived from \"guaca\" (from “aguacate” or avocado) and the word mole.\n\n\"Pipián\" is a type of mole, which mostly consists of ground squash seeds. It does not contain chocolate, but generally contains tomatillos, \"hoja santa\", chili peppers, garlic and onions to give it a green hue. There is also a red version, which combines the squash seeds with peanuts, red jalapeños or chipotle, and sesame seeds. Like other moles, it is cooked with broth and then served with poultry and pork, or sometimes with fish and vegetables.\n\n\"Mole verde\" can refer to a number of different sauces that all finished with a green color. Most of these must be made fresh and not from a mix, as they require a number of fresh herbs and other ingredients. Another version comes from Veracruz, where pork is covered in a sauce made from ground peanuts, tomatillos and cilantro, with the last two giving the sauce its green color.\n\nWhile not moles in the classic sense, there are some dishes that use the term in their name. \"Mole de olla\" is a stew made from beef and vegetables, which contains guajillo and ancho chiles, as well as a number of other ingredients found in moles. \"Huatzmole\" is a mole sauce variation, which is soupy and often served over goat meat (\"cabrito\").\n\nIn Guatemala, mole is a dessert sauce made from chocolate, dried chillis, tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. It is often poured over fried plantains, and is served with sesame seeds on top.\n\nMole is one of the most representative dishes of Mexico, especially for major celebrations. Ninety-nine percent of Mexicans have tried at least one type of mole. The dish enjoys its greatest popularity in central and southern Mexico, but simpler versions of \"mole poblano\" did make their way north. However, northern versions are far less complex and generally used to make enchiladas.\n\nThe consumption of mole is strongly associated with celebrations. In Mexico, to say \"to go to a mole\" (ir a un mole) means to go to a wedding. Mole has a strong flavor, especially the dark ones and is considered to be an acquired taste for most. This has spawned another saying, \"en su mero mole\", which means something like \"one's cup of tea\".\n\nTo promote their regional versions of the sauce, a number of places host festivals dedicated to it. The \"Feria Nacional del Mole\" (National Festival of Mole) was begun in 1977 in San Pedro Atocpan, and is held each year in October. It began outside the town, in the small community of Yenhuitlalpan, in May. The four restaurants there decided to take advantage of the festival of the \"Señor de las Misericordias\" (Lord of the Mercies) to promote their moles. Despite their success, a number in the village did not like that they were using a religious festival for commercial ends, so a separate mole festival was created for October. Today, 37 restaurants and mole producers participate in the event. The most popular variety is the \"mole almendrado\". Originally, the October version of the fair was held in the town proper, but after it became too big, it was moved to prepared fairgrounds outside along the highway.\n\nThe city of Puebla also holds an annual mole festival, whose proceeds are shared among the Santa Rosa, Santa Inés and Santa Catarina convents. The world's record for the largest pot of mole was broken at the city's 2005 festival. The pot was 1.4 meters in diameter at the base, 1.9 meters high, with a diameter of 2.5 meters at the top. Four hundred people participated in its preparation, using 800 kilos of mole paste, 2,500 kilos of chicken, 500 kilos of tortillas and 1,600 kilos of broth. The resulting food fed 11,000 people.\n\nThe women of Santa María Magdalena in Querétaro have been locally known for their mole for about 100 years. In 1993, they decided to hold a contest for the best mole. This was the beginning of the \"Feria del Mole y Tortilla\" (Mole and Tortilla Festival), which has been held every year since then. It still features a mole cook-off and attracts hundreds of visitors from the state. The community of Coatepec de Morelos in the municipality of Zitácuaro, Michoacán, holds an annual \"Feria de Mole\" in April.\n\nMole has become a popular and widely available prepared food product in the United States. Several brands of mole paste are available in the United States and can be found online. Chicago has an annual mole festival for Mexican immigrants at the Universidad Popular community center. The event is a cooking contest, which had over 40 entries, with the winner taking away US$500.\n\nWhile mole has traditionally been eaten by all levels of Mexican society, especially at celebrations, the upper classes have begun to stop preparing and consuming the dish. According to one survey of upper-class housewives between 30 and 50 years of age, 95% had never cooked it from scratch. They had only eaten it at home at their children's requests after hearing about it. This is in contrast to their mothers and grandmothers for whom mole symbolized being Mexican. The dish is being less seen in the traditional celebrations, as well. This may be because those in this stratum of society have come to prefer foreign foods. The owners of La California, a mole producer in Guanajuato, state it is harder to market regional mole in Mexico than in the exterior. They say that many in Mexico do not consider it a gourmet product, or something that can be consumed with wine. In Mexico, the preferences of the upper classes are often eventually copied in the lower classes. Some people, such as Lula Bertrán of the Círculo Mexicano de Arte Culinario, see this as a warning sign for the dish.\n\n\n"}

They are often garnished with almonds, either whole or chopped. There are hundreds of cocadas recipes, from the typical hard, very sweet balls to cocadas that are almost the creamy texture of flan.

Cocadas are mentioned as early as 1878 in Peru.\n\nIn Colombia and Mexico, cocadas are sold not only as artisan candies from shops, but commonly on the streets, out of baskets, and particularly on the beaches, by men or women who carry them on large aluminum trays. \nIn Uruguay, they are commonly sold in bakeries under the name of \"coquitos\", the more delicate versions include a cherry on the top and syrup coating, sometimes they fill the boxes of assorted \"masas\".\n\nIn Brazil, cocadas are a traditional confectionery originating from the north-east of the country.

It also goes under the names of Bohnen, Birnen und Speck and, locally, the Low German names of \"Grööner Hein\" and \"Grönen Heini\". The ingredients required mean that the dish is mainly eaten in the months of August and September.\n\nThe dish is a type of stew, in which—as the name indicates—the main ingredients are pears, beans and bacon. In North German country kitchens, potatoes would also be added, even though they are not specifically mentioned.\n\nGenerally cut French beans (\"Brechbohnen\") are used. In Hamburg on the markets occasionally \"Turkish peas\" may be found, despite its name a Vierlande bean variety that used to be frequently used for this dish. During preparation several sprigs of savory are added to the beans.\n\nThe pears used for this dish are cooking pears which would otherwise be inedible eaten as fruit in their own right. They are small, green, rock-hard and do not have the sweetness and juiciness of the popular eating varieties. These pears are mainly found at markets and in small vegetable shops. In the Hamburg area, other varieties are used: the \"Vierländer\" and the rather sweeter \"Finkenwerder\" cooking pears. The \"Vierländer\" sort have a slightly firmer consistency after cooking which is preferred by many.\nThese cooking pears are only available from July to September, subject to the weather. As a last resort for those who have missed the right season, \"Bürgermeisterbirne\" pears may be used. They are not as sweet when raw and are clearly sweeter.\n\nThe bacon used is streaky, smoky bacon. Here, too, it is important if the dish is to taste its best not to use 'any old bacon'. The origin—whether from the Vierlande, the Black Forest or Tyrol—is immaterial; all of them are suitable and offer a variety of interesting flavours. The deciding factor is the storage of the bacon. Only streaky bacon that has been air-dried and stored produces when cooked that pleasant taste of seasoned fat that melts in the mouth. Bacon, which—as is common today—has been stored hygienically in its vacuum wrapper, only produces a sort of fibrous stringiness after being cooked.\n\nThe Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein preference is to add potatoes to their \"Bohnen, Birnen und Speck\" that are still firm when cooked—such as the Cilena or Linda varieties. In Land Hadeln beef or lamb can also be cooked along with the bacon.\n\nAccording to taste, the bacon is placed either in complete strips or cut up into water which is then brought to the boil. Meanwhile, the beans are cleaned, washed and cut into sections. After 25 minutes of cooking, the beans are added together with the savory to the bacon and cooking continues.\nThe flowers are removed from the pears, but the stalks are left on. The pears are left with their skins on throughout. They are then laid on the beans and everything is cooked together.\n\nThe peeled potatoes are boiled separately in salted water. Towards the end of the overall cooking time of about 50 minutes, some flour is mixed with water, poured into the pot and briefly boiled up.\n\nTypical quantities for four people are:\n\nEach person is served one or two pears, a good portion of bacon, beans and potatoes and broth according to preference. A fresh beer goes well with the dish.\n\nThere are variations that do away with the savory, but add freshly chopped parsley towards the end, which use broth instead of water for cooking (ready-made or home-made) or which use pepper.\n\n\n"}

This is one of the earliest examples of using counting-rod numerals in writing.\n\nIn 1976 a bundle of Western Han-era (202 BCE to 9 CE) counting rods made of bones was unearthed from Qianyang County in Shaanxi. The use of counting rods must predate it; Sunzi ( 544 to 496 BCE), a military strategist at the end of Spring and Autumn period of 771 BCE to 5th century BCE, mentions their use to make calculations to win wars before going into the battle; Laozi (died 531 BCE), writing in the Warring States period, said \"a good calculator doesn't use counting rods\". The \"Book of Han\" (finished 111 CE) recorded: \"they calculate with bamboo, diameter one fen, length six cun, arranged into a hexagonal bundle of two hundred seventy one pieces\".\n\nAt first, calculating rods were round in cross-section, but by the time of the Sui dynasty (581 to 618 CE) mathematicians used triangular rods to represent positive numbers and rectangular rods for negative numbers.\n\nAfter the abacus flourished, counting rods were abandoned except in Japan, where rod numerals developed into a symbolic notation for algebra.\n\nCounting rods represent digits by the number of rods, and the perpendicular rod represents five. To avoid confusion, vertical and horizontal forms are alternately used. Generally, vertical rod numbers are used for the position for the units, hundreds, ten thousands, etc., while horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc. It is written in \"Sunzi Suanjing\" that \"one is vertical, ten is horizontal\".\n\nRed rods represent positive numbers and black rods represent negative numbers. Ancient Chinese clearly understood negative numbers and zero (leaving a blank space for it), though they had no symbol for the latter. The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, which was mainly composed in the first century CE, stated \"(when using subtraction) subtract same signed numbers, add different signed numbers, subtract a positive number from zero to make a negative number, and subtract a negative number from zero to make a positive number\". Later, a go stone was sometimes used to represent zero.\n\nThis alternation of vertical and horizontal rod numeral form is very important to understanding written transcription of rod numerals on manuscripts correctly. For instance, in Licheng suanjin, 81 was transcribed as , and 108 was transcribed as ; it is clear that the latter clearly had a blank zero on the \"counting board\" (i.e., floor or mat), even though on the written transcription, there was no blank. In the same manuscript, 405 was transcribed as , with a blank space in between for obvious reasons, and could in no way be interpreted as \"45\". In other words, transcribed rod numerals may not be positional, but on the counting board, they are positional. is an exact image of the counting rod number 405 on a table top or floor.\n\nThe value of a number depends on its physical position on the counting board. A 9 at the rightmost position on the board stands for 9. Moving the batch of rods representing 9 to the left one position (i.e., to the tens place) gives 9[] or 90. Shifting left again to the third position (to the hundreds place) gives 9[][] or 900. Each time one shifts a number one position to the left, it is multiplied by 10. Each time one shifts a number one position to the right, it is divided by 10. This applies to single-digit numbers or multiple-digit numbers.\n\nSong dynasty mathematician Jia Xian used hand-written Chinese decimal orders 步十百千萬 as rod numeral place value, as evident from a facsimile from a page of Yongle Encyclopedia. He arranged 七萬一千八百二十四 as\n\nHe treated the Chinese order numbers as place value markers, and 七一八二四 became place value decimal number. He then wrote the rod numerals according to their place value:\n\nIn Japan, mathematicians put counting rods on a counting board, a sheet of cloth with grids, and used only vertical forms relying on the grids. An 18th-century Japanese mathematics book has a checker counting board diagram, with the order of magnitude symbols \"千百十一分厘毛“(thousand, hundred, ten, unit, tenth, hundredth, thousandth).\n\nExamples:\nRod numerals are a positional numeral system made from shapes of counting rods. Positive numbers are written as they are and the negative numbers are written with a slant bar at the last digit. The vertical bar in the horizontal forms 6–9 are drawn shorter to have the same character height.\n\nA circle (〇) is used for 0. Many historians think it was imported from Indian numerals by Gautama Siddha in 718, but some think it was created from the Chinese text space filler \"□\", and others think that the Indians acquired it from China, because it resembles a Confucian philosophical symbol for \"nothing\".\n\nIn the 13th century, Southern Song mathematicians changed digits for 4, 5, and 9 to reduce strokes. The new horizontal forms eventually transformed into Suzhou numerals. Japanese continued to use the traditional forms.\n\nExamples:\nIn Japan, Seki Takakazu developed the rod numerals into symbolic notation for algebra and drastically improved Japanese mathematics. After his period, the positional numeral system using Chinese numeral characters was developed, and the rod numerals were used only for the plus and minus signs. \n\nA fraction was expressed with rod numerals as two rod numerals one on top of another (without any other symbol, like the modern horizontal bar).\n\nThe method for using counting rods for mathematical calculation was called \"rod calculation\" or rod calculus (筹算). Rod calculus can be used for a wide range of calculations, including finding the value of , finding square roots, cube roots, or higher order roots, and solving a system of linear equations.\n\nBefore the introduction of written zero, there was no way to distinguish 10007 and 107 in written forms except by inserting a bigger space between 1 and 7, and so rod numerals were used only for doing calculations with counting rods. Once written zero came into play, the rod numerals had become independent, and their use indeed outlives the counting rods, after its replacement by abacus. One variation of horizontal rod numerals, the Suzhou numerals is still in use for book-keeping and in herbal medicine prescription in Chinatowns in some parts of the world.\n\nUnicode 5.0 includes counting rod numerals in their own block in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP) from U+1D360 to U+1D37F. The code points for the horizontal digits 1–9 are U+1D360 to U+1D368 and those for the vertical digits 1–9 are U+1D369 to U+1D371. The former are called \"unit digits\" and the latter are called \"tens digits\", which is opposite of the convention described above. Zero should be represented by U+3007 (〇, ideographic number zero) and the negative sign should be represented by U+20E5 (combining reverse solidus overlay). As these were recently added to the character set and since they are included in the SMP, font support may still be limited.\n\n\nFor a look of the ancient counting rods, and further explanation, you can visit the sites\n"}

It consists of barley groats cooked in sausage juices (\"Wurstbrühe\"), which are enriched with pieces of meat, offal, such as heart, kidney or liver and seasoned with spices and salt. More rarely, finely chopped onions are added. The cooked ingredients are minced after the juices have been poured off and a crumbly cake is left which is held together with fat and which sets on cooling. There are various recipes, but they all contain barley groats, fat and meat.\n\nA classic recipe contains pig offal or heart, belly pork with rind, lard greaves, barley groats, water, salt, pepper, allspice and thyme. The nutrition varies; one portion made from about 300 g of pork and 60 g of groats contains about 850 kJ.\n\nIts relatively high fat content means that \"Stippgrütze\" keeps well and is often preserved or frozen, so that it can be used over the winter. The season for \"Stippgrütze\" begins with the traditional \"Schlachtfest\" or country feast in October or November, when the pigs are slaughtered, and lasts until spring.\n\nIn the shops \"Stippgrütze\" is usually sold in sausage form in clear artificial casings about 12 cm in diameter. To prepare it a large piece is fried in a pan without any additional fat, until a firm crust forms on the underside, occasionally it is stirred and fried again. A sort of porridge or puree (\"Brei\") results, hence its other name of \"Wurstebrei\" (sausage puree).\n\n\"Stippgrütze\" is served hot out of the pan and usually consumed at dinner (evening meal) together with or on top of coarse rye bread. For a main meal around midday salt or roast potatoes are usually served with it. It is common for \"Stippgrütze\" to include a pickled gherkin. Its acidity supports the digestion and palatability of this fatty meal. Due to its high fat content \"Stippgrütze\" is also commonly eaten before enjoying alcoholic drinks.\n\nThe use of cooked offal together with coarsely-ground cereal exists in many cultures and used to be viewed as 'poor man's food'. Examples include the Scottish haggis prepared in a very similar way from oats and sheep's innards or the Swedish dish, \"Pölsa\".\n\n"}

Test marketing began in March 2010.\n\nThe new product is aimed at young men who prefer chilled, bottled lagers to pints of beer. Guinness believes there are lager drinkers that may be interested in a dark beer but not their famous stout. It is being sold in 330 millilitre bottles for six to nine months in Northern Ireland, as a test market for Europe, and in Malaysia to see whether there are opportunities for the product elsewhere. In Malaysia, the beer will be known as Guinness Premium Beer. It will be offered at a comparable price to other premium lagers. The move follows previous attempts by Diageo to boost sales by introducing variations of Guinness stout. In 2005, the company sold Brew 39 in bars in Dublin and before that it introduced Guinness XXX Extra Strong, Guinness Gold. If the beer sells well during its trial, it will be introduced to other markets in Ireland, Europe and the U.S.\n\nGuinness Black Lager is currently available in Australia and Canada. \n\nIn July 2012, Black Lager was launched into the Republic of Ireland market, available in packs of 4 X 330 ml bottles.\n\nDiageo had initially decided not to launch the new beer in the Republic of Ireland because of the massive decrease in alcohol sales in that country. Alcohol consumption has dropped two per cent from its all-time peak in 2001. The lager is being offered at selected bars and off-sales outlets in Northern Ireland. The launch will be accompanied by an advertising and marketing campaign with promotions in bars. As of February 2013, the product is still being advertised in North America.\n\nIt is a 4.5% a.b.v. strength brew and gets its black colour from the roasted barley added into it.\n\nGuinness has made several attempts to vary its brand in the past, some of which were not successful. These include Guinness Breo and Guinness Light.\n"}
{"id": "26683771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26683771", "title": "Guappo", "text": "Guappo\n\nGuappo (plural: \"guappi\") is a historical criminal subculture and word in Neapolitan language, roughly meaning thug, swaggerer, pimp, braggart, ruffian, or hooligan. While today the word is often used to indicate a member of the Camorra, a Mafia-type organisation in the region of Campania and its capital Naples in Italy, the \"guapperia\" (or \"guapparia\"; i.e., the guappo culture) predates the modern Camorra and was originally a different and separate criminal subculture that considered itself very much independent of the Camorra. \n\nHistorically, \"guappo\" referred to a loosely cohesive 19th and early 20th century subculture that thrived in the Naples area and, to a lesser extent, nearby regions of Southern Italy. The subculture stereotypically consisted of a type of flashy, boisterous, swaggering, free-spirited, violent, dandy-like criminal, pimp, outlaw, and ruffian that nonetheless followed a chivalrous code of honor.\n\nThe word most likely derives from the Spanish \"guapo\" (Southern Italy had been under Spanish rule for centuries), meaning bold, elegant, or an ostentatious person, and which eventually derives from the Latin \"vappa\", meaning flat wine or scoundrel. The noun \"guapparía\", which is sometimes also used to indicate the Camorra, means arrogance, domineering, or braggart. The verb \"guappia\" means to behave like a \"guappo\" (Camorrista), to be domineering and derives from the Spanish \"guapear\" (to feign courage, to flaunt elegance). \n\nThe word also might be derived from the Garduña, a fictitious criminal organisation in Spain said to be the precursor of the Camorra. The Garduña was composed of \"guapos\", generally good swordsmen, daring assassins, and committed bandits.\n\nThe word wop, a pejorative American slang term for an Italian, probably derives from guappo.\n\nThough the term today often refers to a member of the Camorra (i.e. a Camorrista), the historical figure of the “guappo” is not necessarily synonymous with the Camorrista. It is a historical figure in the Neapolitan area, distinguishable by his smart or overdressed dandy-like appearance, his unusual pose that serves to draw attention to him, and the particular care he lavishes on his body and face. The guappo could be characterized as \"simple\" or \"posh\" according to the clothes he wore: the former preferred extravagant and flashy clothes while the latter loved to dress in clothes from the best tailors in Naples.\n\nOriginally, the guappo was rather a violent free spirit; free from the law as well as the \"official\" Camorra, with his proper code of honour, at once an extortionist, a rectifier of wrong for the local neighbourhood and a benefactor of artists of the café chantant. He was sometimes allied with, and sometimes a rival of the Camorra. Around 1860, a guappo was described as an independent and individualist camorrista. \n\nWhen the Camorra as an organisation was weak, the guappo flourished. After the first mass trial against the Camorra in 1911-12, and the advent of Fascist rule the Camorra as an organisation was nearly destroyed. The local guappo returned and the interwar period (1918–1939) was the heyday of the individualist guappo power. After World War II, with the return of the Camorra, the figure of the guappo eventually merged into the organisation. A typical guappo of that era was Pasquale Simonetti, also known as \"Pascalone ‘e Nola\", who controlled the Naples fruit market. He was married to Pupetta Maresca and famous for publicly slapping American Mafia boss, Lucky Luciano, at the Agnano racetrack. (In actual fact, the perpetrator was Francesco Pirozzi, known as \"Ciccillo 'o francese\", one of the men of Camorra boss Alfredo Maisto.)\n\nThe Guappo is present in Neapolitan drama, music and literature, such as the Neapolitan song \"Guapparia\" by of the poet Libero Bovio, in works of the author Raffaele Viviani, and the journalists Ferdinando Russo and Matilde Serao. The famous comedian Totò played a role of an ordinary person bullied by a \"guappo\" in \"The Gold of Naples\" () a 1954 Italian comedy film directed by Vittorio De Sica. The Neapolitan composer of operas Domenico Cimarosa features a Guappo in his 1786 opera Il credulo. The transition from \"guapparia\" to Camorra in the mid-20th Century is portrayed in several filmic sceneggiate starring Italian actor and singer Mario Merola, who often played the role of an old-style \"guappo\" standing up against the injustices brought about by the Camorra; examples include \"Sgarro alla camorra\" (\"Affront to the Camorra\", 1973) and \"L<nowiki>'</nowiki>ultimo guappo\" (\"The last guappo\", 1978).\n\n"}

Today, it usually refers to the practice in many parts of Germany, such as the Palatinate, for a celebration or festival involving the ceremonial slaughter of a pig reared or bought by a private household or an inn for that purpose.\n\nThe menu for such a \"Schlachtfest\" in the Palatinate includes soup (\"Metzelsuppe\"), various sausages (\"Pfälzer Leberwurst, Blutwurst\" and \"Bratwurst\"), liver dumplings (\"Leberknödel\"), boiled belly pork (\"Wellfleisch\") and \"Sauerkraut\". It was common when a pig was slaughtered at home that \"Metzelsuppe\" was given as a gift to neighbours, often in milk churns. Frequently the neighbours bought some of the fresh sausages so produced. Wine was drunk with the meal. The slaughter of a pig by an inn was called a \"Schlachtfest\". Within the village everyone knew it was happening because a pig's bladder would be hung up outside. Occasionally this is still the case today.\n\nThe organisation of a \"Schlachtfest\" at home and giving \"Metzelsuppe\" and sausages to family members and neighbours is still fairly common today in the German-speaking world e.g. in Swabia or Lower Saxony.\n\n"}

The cooking process produces sausage juices which, together with any split sausages, are used as a soup known as \"Metzelsuppe\". As a result, in many places, e.g. in parts of the Palatinate, the entire festival and the meal in particular, is known as metzelsupp.\n\nCommon accompaniments to a \"Schlachtplatte\" are \"sauerkraut\" and bread or potatoes or, in South Germany, potato pancakes (\"Dotsch\" or \"Reiberdatschi\"). Other elements might be fresh \"Bratwurst\" and \"Mettwurst\" or raw, spiced bratwurst filling. In Rhinehessen it is also common to enrich the dish with a sauce from part of the pig's blood (\"Schweinepfeffer\" or \"Schwarz Brie\").\n\nThe word is derived from \"schlachten\", \"to slaughter\", and \"Platte\", \"dish\", because, traditionally, it is only eaten on the day of slaughter; before the invention of refrigerators blood and sensitive organs like liver had to be prepared straight away. Meat, which did not have to be consumed immediately was preserved by salting, drying and smoking. The slaughtering day offered a rare opportunity to eat fresh meat which explains why the \"Schlachtplatte\" is a rather lavish meal.\n\nOriginally these slaughtering days took place mainly in the autumn. This meant that not so many animals had to be fed over the winter, the meat could be preserved for longer in the cooler temperatures and the farmers had more time after the last harvest for turning it into ham and sausages which could then be smoked over the winter hearth fire.\n\n"}

An (plural: \"orthoses\") is \"an externally applied device used to modify the structural and functional characteristics of the neuromuscular and skeletal system\". An orthotist is the primary medical clinician responsible for the prescription, manufacture and management of orthoses.\nAn orthosis may be used to:\nOrthotics combines knowledge of anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology, biomechanics and engineering. Patients who benefit from an orthosis may have a condition such as spina bifida or cerebral palsy, or have experienced a spinal cord injury or stroke. Equally, orthoses are sometimes used prophylactically or to optimise performance in sport.\n\nOrthoses were traditionally made by following a tracing of the extremity with measurements to assist in creating a well-fitted device. Subsequently, the advent of plastics as a material of choice for construction necessitated the idea of creating a plaster of Paris mould of the body part in question. This method is still extensively used throughout the industry. Currently, CAD/CAM, CNC machines and 3D printing are involved in orthotic manufacture.\n\nOrthoses are made from various types of materials including thermoplastics, carbon fibre, metals, elastic, EVA, fabric or a combination of similar materials. Some designs may be purchased at a local retailer; others are more specific and require a prescription from a physician, who will fit the orthosis according to the patient's requirements. Over-the-counter braces are basic and available in multiple sizes. They are generally slid on or strapped on with Velcro, and are held tightly in place. One of the purposes of these braces is injury protection.\n\nUnder the International Standard terminology, orthoses are classified by an acronym describing the anatomical joints which they contain. For example, an ankle foot orthosis ('AFO') is applied to the foot and ankle, a thoracolumbosacral orthosis ('TLSO') affects the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions of the spine. It is also useful to describe the function of the orthosis. Use of the International Standard is promoted to reduce the widespread variation in description of orthoses, which is often a barrier to interpretation of research studies.\n\nUpper-limb (or upper extremity) orthoses are mechanical or electromechanical devices applied externally to the arm or segments thereof in order to restore or improve function, or structural characteristics of the arm segments encumbered by the device. In general, musculoskeletal problems that may be alleviated by the use of upper limb orthoses include those resulting from trauma or disease (arthritis for example). They may also be beneficial in aiding individuals who have suffered a neurological impairment such as stroke, spinal cord injury, or peripheral neuropathy.\n\n\nA lower-limb orthosis is an external device applied to a lower-body segment to improve function by controlling motion, providing support through stabilizing gait, reducing pain through transferring load to another area, correcting flexible deformities, and preventing progression of fixed deformities. The term caliper or calipers remains in widespread use for lower-limb orthoses in the United Kingdom.\n\nFoot orthoses (commonly called \"orthotics\") are devices inserted into shoes to provide support for the foot by redistributing ground reaction forces acting on the foot joints while standing, walking or running. They may be either pre-moulded (also called pre-fabricated) or custom made according to a cast or impression of the foot. A great body of information exists within the orthotic literature describing their medical use for people with foot problems as well as the impact \"orthotics\" can have on foot, knee, hip, and spine deformities. They are used by everyone from athletes to the elderly to accommodate biomechanical deformities and a variety of soft tissue conditions. Custom-made foot orthoses are effective at reducing pain for people with painful high-arched feet, and may be effective for people with rheumatoid arthritis, plantar fasciitis or hallux valgus (\"bunions\"). For children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) custom-made and pre-fabricated foot orthoses may also reduce foot pain. Foot orthoses may also be used in conjunction with properly fitted orthopaedic footwear in the prevention of foot ulcers in the at-risk diabetic foot.\n\nAn ankle–foot orthosis (AFO) is an orthosis or brace that encumbers the ankle and foot. AFOs are externally applied and intended to control position and motion of the ankle, compensate for weakness, or correct deformities. AFOs can be used to support weak limbs, or to position a limb with contracted muscles into a more normal position. They are also used to immobilize the ankle and lower leg in the presence of arthritis or fracture, and to correct foot drop; an AFO is also known as a foot-drop brace.\nAnkle–foot orthoses are the most commonly used orthoses, making up about 26% of all orthoses provided in the United States. According to a review of Medicare payment data from 2001 to 2006, the base cost of an AFO was about $500 to $700. An AFO is generally constructed of lightweight polypropylene-based plastic in the shape of an \"L\", with the upright portion behind the calf and the lower portion running under the foot. They are attached to the calf with a strap, and are made to fit inside accommodative shoes. The unbroken \"L\" shape of some designs provides rigidity, while other designs (with a jointed ankle) provide different types of control.\n\nObtaining a good fit with an AFO involves one of two approaches:\nThe International Red Cross recognizes four major types of AFOs:\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross published its manufacturing guidelines for ankle–foot orthoses in 2006. Its intent is to provide standardized procedures for the manufacture of high-quality modern, durable and economical devices to people with disabilities throughout the world.\n\nA custom-made ankle/foot orthosis for the treatment of patients having plantar ulcers is disclosed, which comprises a rigid L-shaped support member and a rigid anterior support shell hingedly articulated to the L-shaped support member. The plantar portion of the L-shaped member further comprises at least one ulcer-protecting hollow spatially located for fitted placement in inferior adjacency to a user's plantar ulcer, thus allowing the user to transfer the user's weight away from the plantar ulcer and facilitating plantar ulcer treatment. The anterior support shell is designed for lateral hinged attachment to the L-shaped member to take advantage of medial tibial flare structure for enhancing the weight-bearing properties of the disclosed orthosis. A flexible, polyethylene hinge member hingedly attaches the anterior support shell to the L-shaped member and securing straps securely attach the anterior support shell in fixed, weight-bearing relation about the proximal, anterior portion of the user's lower leg.\n\nA knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) is an orthosis that encumbers the knee, ankle and foot. Motion at all three of these lower limb areas is affected by a KAFO and can include stopping motion, limiting motion, or assisting motion in any or all of the three planes of motion in a human joint: sagittal, coronal, and axial. Mechanical hinges, as well as electrically controlled hinges have been used. Various materials for fabrication of a KAFO include but are not limited to metals, plastics, fabrics, and leather. Conditions that might benefit from the use of a KAFO include paralysis, joint laxity or arthritis, fracture, and others.\nAlthough not as widely used as knee orthoses, KAFOs can make a real difference in the life of a paralyzed person, helping them to walk therapeutically or, in the case of polio patients, on a community level. These devices are expensive and require maintenance. Some research is being done to enhance the design; even NASA helped spearhead the development of a special knee joint for KAFOs.\n\nA knee orthosis (KO) or knee brace is a brace that extends above and below the knee joint and is generally worn to support or align the knee. In the case of diseases causing neurological or muscular impairment of muscles surrounding the knee, a KO can prevent flexion or extension instability of the knee. In the case of conditions affecting the ligaments or cartilage of the knee, a KO can provide stabilization to the knee by replacing the function of these injured or damaged parts. For instance, knee braces can be used to relieve pressure from the part of the knee joint affected by diseases such as arthritis or osteoarthritis by realigning the knee joint into valgus or varus. In this way a KO may help reduce osteoarthritis pain, however, there is no clear evidence to advise people with osteoarthritis of the knee about the most effective orthosis to use or the best approach to rehabilitation. A knee brace is not meant to treat an injury or disease on its own, but is used as a component of treatment along with drugs, physical therapy and possibly surgery. When used properly, a knee brace may help an individual to stay active by enhancing the position and movement of the knee or reducing pain.\n\nProphylactic braces are used primarily by athletes participating in contact sports. Evidence about prophylactic knee braces, the ones football linemen wear that are often rigid with a knee hinge, indicates they are ineffective in reducing anterior cruciate ligament tears, but may be helpful in resisting medial and lateral collateral ligament tears.\n\nFunctional braces are designed for use by people who have already experienced a knee injury and need support to recover from it. They are also indicated to help people who are suffering from pain associated with arthritis. They are intended to reduce the rotation of the knee and support stability. They reduce the chance of hyperextension, and increase the agility and strength of the knee. The majority of these are made of elastic. They are the least expensive of all braces and are easily found in a variety of sizes.\n\nRehabilitation braces are used to limit the movement of the knee in both medial and lateral directions- these braces often have an adjustable range of motion stop potential for limiting flexion and extension following ACL reconstruction. They are primarily used after injury or surgery to immobilize the leg. They are larger in size than other braces, due to their function.\n\nScoliosis, a condition describing an abnormal curvature of the spine, may in certain cases be treated with spinal orthoses, such as the Milwaukee brace, the Boston brace, and Charleston bending brace. As this condition develops most commonly in adolescent females who are undergoing their pubertal growth spurt, compliance with wearing is these orthoses is hampered by the concern these individuals have about changes in appearance and restriction caused by wearing these orthoses.\nSpinal orthoses may also be used in the treatment of spinal fractures. A Jewett brace, for instance, may be used to facilitate healing of an anterior wedge fracture involving the T10 to L3 vertebrae. A body jacket may be used to stabilize more involved fractures of the spine. The halo brace is a cervical thoracic orthosis used to immobilize the cervical spine, usually following fracture. The halo brace allows the least cervical motion of all cervical orthoses currently in use; it was first developed by Vernon L. Nickel at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in 1955.\n\nOrthotists are healthcare professionals who specialize in the provision of orthoses. In the United States, orthotists work by prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Physical therapists are not legally authorized to prescribe orthoses in the U.S. In the U.K., orthotists will often accept open referrals for orthotic assessment without a specific prescription from doctors or other healthcare professionals.\n\nIn Canada, a Certified Orthotist CO(c) provides clinical assessment, treatment plan development, patient management, technical design, and fabrication of custom orthoses to maximize patient outcomes. To become CBCPO certified through Orthotics Prosthetics Canada (OPC) an applicant must successfully meet the following requirements:\n- be fluent in French or English; \n- be a Canadian citizen or legal landed immigrant; \n- graduate from an OPC approved post-secondary clinical Prosthetic and Orthotic program; \n- complete a minimum 3450 hours of Residency in Orthotics under the direct supervision of a Canadian certified orthotist; \n- successfully challenge the written, oral and practical national certification exams.\n\nUpon successful completion of the national certification exams, candidates are conferred the designation of Canadian Certified Orthotist CO(c).\n\nIn the UK orthotists assess patients, and where appropriate design and fit orthoses for any part of the body. Registration is with the Health and Care Professions Council and BAPO - The British Association of Prosthetists and Orthotists. The training is a B.Sc.(Hons) in Prosthetics and Orthotics at either the University of Salford or University of Strathclyde. New graduates are therefore eligible to work as an orthotist and/or prosthetist.\n\nPodiatrists are the other profession involved with foot orthotic provision. They are also registered with the Health and Care Professions Council . Podiatrists assess gait to provide orthotics to improve foot function and alignment or may use orthoses to redistribute stress on pressure areas for those with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nA licensed orthotist is an orthotist who is recognized by the particular state in which they are licensed to have met basic standards of proficiency, as determined by examination and experience to adequately and safely contribute to the health of the residents of that state. An American Board of Certification certified orthotist has met certain standards; these include a degree in orthotics, completion of a one-year residency at an approved clinical site, and passing a rigorous three-part exam. A certified orthotist (CO) is an orthotist who has passed the certification standards of the American Board of Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics. Other credentialing bodies who are involved in orthotics include the Board for Orthotic Certification, the pharmaceutical industry, the Pedorthic Footcare Association, and various of the professional associations who work with athletic trainers, physical and occupational therapists, and orthopedic technologists/cast technicians.\n\nFour universities including the Iran University of Medical Science, Isfahan University of Medical Science, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences and Iran Red Crescent University confer bachelor of science in the Prosthetics and Orthotics. Three universities including Isfahan University of Medical Science, the Iran University of Medical Science and University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Science also confer M.Sc. and Ph.D. New bachelor graduates are eligible to work as an orthotist and prosthetist after registration in the Medical Council of Iran.\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally used in making binignit in the Visayan region of the Philippines.\n\nThe process is very similar in making sago. First, the buli palm is felled. The hard core can be reached by breaking the trunk open. The hard core is chopped into fragments that should be dried perfectly and hand crushed into powder form thereby turning it into flour. This process requires several rounds of pounding. This is then mixed with water to form the product.

It is not a mere adaption of four player mahjong to suit only three players but has its own rules and idiosyncrasies that place it apart from the more standard variations. The equipment used and the basic mechanisms are much like four player variations though some tiles are removed, certain plays are prohibited and the scoring system is simplified. The game is embraced in some Asian countries while ignored or snubbed in others.\n\nThree-player mahjong is played mostly in Japan, Korea and Malaysia. This article focuses on rules from the earlier two (Japan/Korea) while other variations are covered in the following section. The rules given below are the most commonly used rules in Korean/Japanese three player mahjong while optional house rules (extra rules which groups may opt to use) are listed afterwards. There are numerous possible house rules meaning three player mahjong can be as simple or complex as players prefer.\n\nThree-player mahjong is probably as old as mahjong itself, though it is speculated that mahjong originated as a game for only two players.\nKorean/Japanese Three Player Mahjong, played in east Asia is an amalgamation of Old Korean Mahjong rules (which traditionally omitted the bamboo suit and did not allow melded chows and had a very simple scoring system) with some elements of Japanese rules including sacred discard (a player cannot rob a piece to win if he discarded it before) and many bonus-points. Korean mahjong in the past included many elements of both traditional Chinese mahjong and the Japanese scoring system. The rules have changed and there are no standard rules, though this variation shown here reflects the old rules though adapted for modern three player play (as Koreans include some or all bamboo pieces now). An experienced player should be able to read the recap at the bottom of this section and understand the rules well. Non experienced players would need to read the following to understand the game.\n\nOne of the motivations for playing with three players, is that finding a fourth may be difficult or that having one cancelling player (for a four player game) ruins the possibility of playing at all and thus knowing how to play three player mahjong means players can play, or always playing three player mahjong limits the likelihood of someone cancelling. However, the dynamics of playing with three players is also a good motivation, especially when playing traditional Korean rules.\n\nThree player Mahjong, is based on the Korean version adding a few Japanese elements. It is well suited to three players, challenging and has various ways to score points. The following is a basic presentation of the most commonly used rules with a list of the many variations afterwards.\n\nThree Player Mahjong is played with a standard mahjong set with several tiles removed. First, the north wind is removed. The 2-8 of bamboo is also removed. The four season tiles are also removed but the four flowers are kept. There are no jokers or any other extra tiles\n\nCircles or Dots Numbered 1 to 9\n\nCharacters Numbered 1 to 9\n\nAll Four of 1 and 9 bamboo are used with 2–8 removed\n\nThe East, South and West (North is omitted)\n\nThe White, Green and Red Dragons\nThe four flowers (there is only one of each)\n\nThe circles, characters and bamboo are called simple tiles (they are numbered 1 to 9 and only tiles 1 and 9 are used in the bamboo suit). Of the dragons and winds (called honours) there are three kinds of each with no numerical value. Of both simples and honours there are four matching tiles for each value (i.e. there are four red dragons and there are four II dots).\n\nDealing is the same as with Hong Kong Mahjong except the wall is smaller and four tiles are placed in the middle of the wall for flower replacements (explained below).\n\nEach players hand consists of 13 tiles. In sequence, players pick up a tile and discard one until a player has a legal hand. The majority of legal hands consists of 4 melds of three tiles and one pair of identical tiles. Melds can also consist of four tiles under certain conditions and there are a few uncommon and very specific winning hands that have a unique composition that break all the rules. A game rarely consists of players taking turns picking up a new tile from the wall and discarding as there are many ways such play can be interrupted.\n\nHands consist of four melds and one matching pair of tiles.\n\nA chow is a set which consists of three pieces in one suit (either circles or characters) in numerical sequence (i.e. 5-6-7 of characters or 2-3-4 of dots). It can only be made of circles or characters as the remaining bamboo suit allows for no consecutive numerical sequence anymore. Chows must contain three tiles, two or four tile chows are not permitted.\n\nA pong is a set which consists of three identical pieces of any tile (except flowers which are bonus tiles and are always set aside). Examples would be three red dragons or three 2 of dots.\n\nA kong is a special type of pong which consists of all four pieces of any tile. See below for the procedures for declaring a kong. It is the only set that permits four tiles.\n\nOn top of the 4 melds (chows and or pongs/kongs) a winning hand must also include an eye. The eye is a pair of tiles (two matching identical tiles) such as two Green Dragons or two 9 of bamboos. Any simple tile or honour tile can be used.\n\nThree players start with 13 tiles and the dealer with fourteen. The dealer begins by discarding one tile. All players must have only 13 tiles in their hand, not including flowers which are set aside nor the 4th piece of any kong they might have (which is considered an extra tile). Any Kong declared or flower set aside, is replaced by a tile from the wall. After the dealer discards, the next player picks the next available tile from the wall (going clockwise) and discards a tile. Play continues until a player forms a legal hand with the 14th tile drawn from the wall. Play may be interrupted for any of the following reasons\n\nIf a player can use an opponent's discard to complete a pong the player calls this out (before the next player in turn has a chance to draw from the wall). He or she picks up the discarded tile, reveals the two matching pieces in his or her hand and sets them down face up on the table in front of his hand and then discards a tile. Play continues with the next player (clockwise to the player who stole the pong) taking his turn and drawing a tile from the wall. A previously discarded tile cannot be used to make a pong (nor for any other reason) after the next player draws a tile from the wall meaning all discarded tiles beforehand are untouchable.\n\nAt any point during a players turn they may add a piece in their hand to a declared pong (a pong which was formed by stealing it from another player's discard). The player adds it to the pong (placing three in a row and one on top of the one in the middle) and takes a tile from the wall to compensate for the extra fourth tile of the kong. If a player has four identical tiles, during his/her turn, they may reveal it to the other players in what is considered a concealed kong (placing two tiles upside down) and draws another tile from the wall to compensate for the fourth tile in the kong.\n\nIf a player declares a kong and another player needs that piece to make a chow and win the game, the player may declare so and \"go mahjong\" (win). It is called robbing the Kong. This does not occur often.\n\nA player, lacking only one piece to form a legal hand (whether completing a chow, pong, eye or special hand) may steal the discard and wins (this takes precedence over any other players attempt to steal the tile. If two players can use the tile to go mahjong, the player with the most hand-points takes the tile. If their hands are equal, the player closest to the player who discarded the tile wins the hand.\n\nDuring a players turn (as mentioned above), at any point if they have all four of one tile, they may declare a hidden kong (meaning the 4th piece wasn't stolen). The player reveals the pieces to the opponents putting all four in a row with two face down and the middle two face up (as the other players have the right to know which tile there are now none left of). The player takes an extra piece from the \"end\" of the wall to make his hand complete and then may discard.\n\nDuring a players turn, if a pong has been stolen and they now have the fourth piece, they may add the fourth piece to the pong to form a kong. The player take an extra piece from the end of the wall.\n\nThe moment a player picks up a flower they should announce so, put it to the side and take a replacement piece from the middle.\n\nNo changes can be made to a pong or kong which has already been declared (it cannot be taken back to form anything else).\n\nA discard cannot be stolen to add the fourth piece to a pong which has already been declared (stolen and revealed to the other players). This can only be formed by the player him or herself taking the 4th piece from the wall on his or her turn.\n\nIf two players both need a piece to win (or from robbing the kong which would be unspeakably rare) then the player who can form the hand with the most hand-points takes it and wins. If both players have the same hand-points, then the player with the most bonus-points takes it and wins. If this is also equal, then the player first clockwise to the player who discarded takes the tile and wins. Winning always takes precedence over forming a pong or kong. Two players cannot both steal a piece to form a pong or kong.\n\nStealing chows are allowed in some versions of Mahjong but not in this version nor in Korean mahjong.\n\nIf it is noted that a player has 14 pieces in their hand (not including flowers or the 4th piece of a kong) after a discard (when it is not their turn) or for that matter more than fourteen or having 12 or less, if a player robs a piece but cannot form the right set, forgets to put aside a flower or has any other irregularity they are usually heavily punished. It depends on the house rules of each group of players. Serious flaws like having 14 pieces should involve having points deducted. Claiming to win mahjong while not having a legal hand should be seriously punished. Knocking over another players tile should be punished. Calling out the wrong name of a tile (while discarding) may be one of the worst offenses possible, especially if another player reveals that they could have stolen it.\n\nAt the end of each hand, the dealership passes to the player clockwise. The dealer is always known as the east player and to his or her right as the south and the third player as west. These directions alternate with the dealer. Three games are known as a round. Each round is also named after a wind. The entire match last 3 sets of 3 hands (9 hands in total): The East round (three hands), South round (three hands) and west round (three hands). In each round, each player is dealer once playing in the East position (as dealer) once and the other players taking the south and west positions.\n\nWhether the dealer wins or not, or if there is a winner or not, wind position changes each time. Unlike other versions of mahjong being East does not give any special bonuses, it does not double the players scores in any way. If a hand ends in a draw (goulash hand), the winner of the next hand first takes the proper points from his opponents and then an extra 5 points from each player. The dealer passes to the next player, even on a goulash hand. If there is a second draw (two goulash hands in a row) the winner of the next round takes 10 points from each player in addition to their other points.\n\nThe wall is usually four sides but can be three in informal play. Players may choose to continue playing a second match after the first one ends (accumulating the points into a double match) or even a triple match meaning a total of 27 hands.\n\nOnly the winners hand is scored (the other players hands take no points). Points are counted based on the individual sets a player has, if they are made of simples or honours (e.g. circles or dragons), if these sets match the players seat (wind tiles), how the hand is composed as a whole (e.g. only one suit or all pongs and an eye) and special patterns. As well bonus-points are scored for having kongs, flowers and other criteria mentioned later. When being introduced to a game, the mechanics may be so overwhelming that no points may be scored and players simply try to win with any legal hand (0 points) until the mechanics of the game is understood. Once this is achieved, the player should be introduced to the minimum point chart and should be encouraged to form hands of at least three minimum points (passed on sets and or overall composition of hand and or special patterns). The scoring chart below gives all possible points. Experienced players will play for a higher minimum.\n\nEven if a player has a legal winning hand, most house rules requires that a player has a minimum number of hand-points first. Typically they are three points for novice play, six points for intermediate play and 7+ points for advanced play. Bonus-points are included in the winners final score but do not count towards the minimum hand-points a player needs to go mahjong (that is a player must have a minimum of hand-points and not a minimum of hand-points plus bonus points).\n\nIf a player wins by stealing a discard, the player who discards has to pay the winner double the winners hand-points (the other player pays nothing). Both players pay the winner bonus-points.\n\nIf a player wins from the wall, both players pay the winner hand-points plus bonus-points.\n\nThe sacred discard is in effect. It means that a players must place their discards in front of them in neat rows showing the history of their discards (usually in rows of 6). A player cannot use a discarded tile from another payer to win based on a previously discarded tile by him/herself.\n\nA player with a concealed hand may declare ready. They can only do so if they are waiting for a single piece to complete a legal hand. The player puts his/her pieces face down and on their turn will take a piece from the wall and must discard it if it doesn't complete a legal-hand. The player gains points if they win though they become completely unable to change their hand.\n\nThe point system is straight forward though may require some time to memorize the various elements. There are two classes of points which are hand-points and bonus-points. There is a special class called limit hands which is treated later. In order to win a player needs to have a legal hand which scores the minimum or higher hand-points that players agree on before play (3 hand-points, 6 hand-points, 7 hand-points etc.)\n\nUnlike many other mahjong variations, only the winner scores and the other players take no points regardless of the content of their hands. Once a player wins he/she adds up all of his/her hand-points. If they meet the minimum hand-points they receive that number of points from the other two players. If they won from a discard then the person who discarded that piece pays for both players (the discarder pays double and the other player pays nothing). The winner then counts his/her bonus-points and collects them from both players (even if the game was won on a discard). If a player was waiting for one tile to win, they pay two bonus points less.\n\nIf a player wins on a limit hand, the player scores either the agreed limit (usually 40 points) or a half limit (usually 20 points) and there is no need to total the other points. Limit hands can make or break a match.\n\nA winning hand must have the minimum number of hand-points agreed on before the match starts. Points are based on specific melds (i.e. chows, pongs) a combination of melds (i.e. two matching pongs, three concealed pongs) or the entire hand (pure hand, seven pairs). Some melds/hands can score more than once (a kong of green dragons score 1 point for being green dragons and another point for being a kong).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe winner adds his/her hand-points to all the following bonus-points which may apply.\n\nPlaying with all the points above and all possible variations is impracticable and complicated. Players chose which points they want to use and will periodically change or add some as long as there is a full consensus. The following variations can be regional. All variations can be incorporated into the basic game.\n\nExperienced players will raise the minimum hand-points needed to four points or more (each time becoming exponentially more challenging). There are a few limit hands. Limit hands are special hands that a player may have which score a set number of points. The amount is high, and depends on whatever limit the players set. If playing for stakes, the limit may be low to avoid having to pay large amounts to each other. A couple patterns (13 orphans and heavenly gates), much like seven pairs, are special hands. They are the only three hands a player can have which do not fit the pattern of four melds and an eye (pongs/chows and a pair). They must be concealed hands though may be won on a discard or from the wall. They are optional and players do not need to include them in their game if not desired. A limit hand may effectively end a match if not playing for stakes as players may not be motivated to continue as beating a player who has won a limit has is incredibly difficult as winning limit hands (full limits especially) are exceedingly rare.\n\nOnly the winner of each game scores points for his/her hand (other players do not score any points but pay points to the winner). The winner will collect his/her total points from each player if he/she wins from the wall (unless a player was declared ready [see below]). If the winner wins on the discard of a player, that player pays the winner and the bonus-points for the other player (the other player pays the winner only the hand-points). There are no doubles nor faan systems as in continental versions of mahjong. Points are never doubled for any reason. In the case of a player winning a half limit or limit hand, both players pay the winner (regardless of if there was a discard or not) either the limit or half of the limit (the limit depends on the players though it should be at least 40 points) and if he/she wins on a discard, the player who discards pays double.\n\nPlayers may place a limit on how many points may be awarded for consecutive goulash hands.\n\nPlayers in Western countries (in casual play only) may shift the winds from E, S, W to N, E S (removing the West wind instead of the North wind and having the dealer as North) to align with Western culture centering their compass on the North.\n\nHands are optional and players may use all hands or choose based on consensus which ones to use. As all are difficult and the limit hands being very rare, all hands are included by most experienced players.\n\n\n\nThirteen tiles are not used in the game and are placed to the side. The dealer turns over one piece. The next tile in sequence is considered a dora (having any of those pieces in a hand will give a bonus-point). For example, if the tile turned over is a 3 circle, then all 4 circles will be considered dora and having a pong of 4 circles will score 3 bonus-points. If a 9 is turned over then the 1 circle is considered a dora. The sequence of dragons is green, red, white, green (i.e. if a red dragon is turned over, the white dragons are dora tiles). The sequence of winds is north, east, south, north. If a flower tile is turned over then all flower tiles score two bonus-points in total and having all three (as the flower turned over is considered a part of the dead wall and not used during the game) then the usual eight bonus-points in total are given.\n\nThe North wind is kept in play but can only be used as a pair (scoring two points) or as a kong (scoring six points). A player cannot call mahjong if they have only a pong of the North. Winning a hand by drawing or stealing a North win scores two extra bonus-points. The North wind is considered an honour tile but there is no round of North nor a North prevailing wind or a North seat position. North Wind is not part of the three little or three big winds limit hand but is part of the 13 orphans limit hand as well as the all-honours hand.\n\nAll bamboo tiles are removed\n\nIf all three players declare ready, depending on the variation, either that particular game is considered a draw, or the winner only wins his hand-points from the other players.\n\nThere are two forms of dora which may optionally be used in three player mahjong.\n\nIn some Japanese mahjong sets, one five circles tile is coloured red and one five characters tile is coloured red (the other matching three of each tile is the normal colour). There are thus only two of these tiles. A player who has one red dora tile in their hand scores one bonus-point and if they have both red dora tiles they score six bonus-points (in total). These dora tiles count as bonus-points and do not count as hand-points nor towards the minimum hand-points needed to go mahjong.\n\nThe second form of dora which is distinct from the first, is the revealing of one tile from the wall before the game begins. If a simple tile is revealed, then the next tile in order becomes a dora tile (i.e. if the 5 circles is revealed, then all 6 circles become dora...or if the 2 character tiles are revealed then the 3 characters become dora).\nIf a nine is revealed then the 1 of the same suit becomes dora. If a 1 bamboo is revealed then a 9 bamboo becomes dora. If a wind is revealed then the next wind in compass order becomes dora. If a dragon is revealed then the next dragon in alphabetical order becomes dora: Green-Red-White-Green.\n\nA player scores one bonus-point for each of these dora tiles used in the winning hand. The player scores one extra point if the player forms the eye using these tiles, two extra points if the player forms a pong and scores six extra points if the player forms a kong using these tiles.\n\nThe red dora tiles are considered distinct from the revealed dora tiles and they should not be confused with each other. Table rules might include the red dora tiles but not the revealed dora tiles or the reverse. If table rules include both dora tiles, care should be taken not to mix the points scored for having them in their winning hand but to do so separately.\n\nThe last thirteen tiles of the wall are not used in the game (considered an invisible fourth player).\n\nPopular in the western part of Honshū, three-player Japanese mahjong incorporates a few changes which makes it more suited to three players and far less complicated than four-player mahjong. The scoring, though simplified, is still somewhat complex. There is no ghost player. Players need a minimum of one yaku to win. Refer to the article on Japanese Mahjong for unique Japanese playing concepts, such as dora and furiten, as well as the scoring system.\n\nTiles 2 through 8 are removed from the character suit. Chows cannot be melded. All four winds are used. Flowers are optional and not normally used. A dora tile is exposed at the beginning of the round, with more dora (such as uradora, kandora, and red fives) used or exposed later on as popular additions. The North wind also acts as a dora (Pei-dora) when it is exposed and set aside, though it may also be discarded as a safe tile (although an opponent may rob a concealed kong or a declared / discarded North tile to win with kokushi musou). Once all North wind tiles are exposed another dora tile is revealed in the dead wall, which consists of fourteen tiles as in four-player mahjong. A player cannot use a discard to win if his hand, prior to using the discard, does not contain a yaku and is not a single wait (i.e., the player can win with more than one possible tile).\n\nOne-han Yaku\n\nTwo-han Yaku\n\n3-han Yaku\n\n4-han Yaku\n\n5-han Yaku\n\n6-han Yaku\n\nYakuman (Limit)\n\nDouble Yakuman\n\nTriple Yakuman\n\nBonus Han\n\nThe payment table is complex.\n\nMalaysian 3-player mahjong is played with only circles and honours, as well as the extra eight flowers in a Malaysian mahjong set (\"face\" and \"animal\" tiles) and jokers, for a total of 84 tiles. \n\nThe following is an overview of set up, game play and scoring. Experienced players should be able to understand the game based on the following and using the scoring table further below. Each element however is detailed in the following sections.\n\nThe North wind is removed. Walls are formed as walls of 13 for dealer and the wall without a seated player and 12 for opponents, or in informal play, dealer with a wall of 19 and opponents with walls of 18 having no fourth wall. Each round includes three matches of three hands and there is no North round. Chows cannot be melded by discards, only pongs and kongs. Seasons are not used. 2-8 of bamboo is removed from the game with the option of using two 5 bamboo pieces which can only be used as a pair (which when successful scores many points). Sacred discard is in effect (you cannot win on a discarded tile if you have discarded it yourself earlier that hand). Discards are placed in front of players in rows of 6. There is not doubling and dealer passes to next player in all cases. In the case of a goulash game (no winner) the next winner takes one point from each player extra. Limit hands are optional and the limit starts at 40 points. Half limit hands in such a case being 20. Limit hands must be concealed. There is a distinction between hand-points and bonus-points. A minimum of 3 hand-points is necessary to win (with experienced player playing with 4 and advanced players 5 minimum hand-points or more). Only winner scores, taking his total score (hand-points and bonus-points) from each player with no doubling of any kind. Discarder pays the other players score and only the bonus-points if the player was ready to win (waiting for one piece with a legal minimum hand-points hand to be acquired). Seat dragons match seat winds (east is green, south is red and west is white). Seasons are omitted. Flowers score one bonus-point each regardless of which numbered flower it is.\n\nThe game dynamics in three player mahjong, regardless of the rule set vary based on speed, the use of tiles, point keeps, using ghost players or not and how the lack of a fourth seat wind is dealt with.\n\nThe game is always faster. With one less hand and more tiles available to the other players, the game is speedy.\n\nThe wall remains the same, though playing with dead walls depends on the variation and the players. In very casual play the wall can consist of three sides.\n\nIn some variations an entire suit is removed. In Malaysian mahjong only the circles and honours are used. In Korean mahjong one suit is removed or in other variations as well as in Japan, numbers 2-8 is removed from one suit. This radically changes the dynamics making certain hands more common such as single suited hands and hands without chows.\n\nIn many versions east scores or pays double (a little more complicated in Japanese scoring), however in Korean scoring and Korean/Japanese scoring, there is no doubling of any kind.\n\nIn some versions there is a ghost player, meaning 13 tiles are not used in the wall to mimic the lack of tiles in 4 player versions. This player also takes one of the four winds, (though no tiles are dealt out to any ghost player nor are points given). In Korean, Japanese and Korean/Japanese mahjong, there is no ghost player and all tiles are used during the games.\n\nIn some variations, each player has a seat dragon as well as a seat wind which changes the point structure. There is however never a prevailing dragon even if there is a prevailing wind. When there is a seat dragon, East is green, South is red and West is white (fortunately it follows in alphabetical order in English from dealer to last player).\n\nIn some variations these are not allowed. Only pongs and kongs in three player games can be melded (or declared) meaning a chow can only be formed by a discard on winning.\n\nIn Korean mahjong, 3 player Japanese mahjong and in Korean/Japanese mahjong, melded chows are never allowed except if done to complete a hand.\n\nIt is far more social and less likely to be played for stakes as it is looked down on as a less serious version of mahjong. However, in some versions such as Korean/Japanese three player, the rules can be intricate or complex and playing for small or large stakes forces the players to try to make more complex hands.\n\nThe point system may or may not change depending on the variation of mahjong. In some variations a higher minimum point is expected or less points are given for certain hands. Table rules are common in three player versions and a comprehensive list of variations or versions would be a massive undertaking not in the known works in any. In Hong Kong Mahjong, the doubling system is used in which certain points pay off a certain amount of money which doubles each subsequent level. For instance 1 or 2 points pay nothing. 3 or 4 points pay one unit, 5 or 6 points pay two units, 7 to 10 points pay 4 units and anything more pays 8 units. The Japanese system is rather complicated, though is simplified in the three player version. The Korean system and Korean/Japanese system is a simple 'pay a unit per point' to the winner. country.\n\nThe best rule set to use is the one you are familiar with, adapting them to three players as you are comfortable. Korean/Japanese mahjong has a comprehensive set of rules well attuned for three player gaming, for those with some experience in mahjong. The Malaysian version is a very simplified way for social playing. House rules of are the essence and players will decide their own rules over time.\n\n"}

The mixture is stirred or blended until smooth, with liqueurs or extracts added if desired. Butter is generally added to give the ganache a shiny appearance and smooth texture. Depending on the kind of chocolate used, for what purpose the ganache is intended, and the temperature at which it will be served, the ratio of chocolate to cream is varied to obtain the desired consistency. Typically, two parts chocolate to one part cream are used for filling cakes or as a base for making chocolate truffles, while one to one is commonly used as a glaze. Cooled ganache can be whipped to increase volume and spread to cover a cake, though as it cools, it becomes thicker and eventually unspreadable. Ganache is also poured into a mold or terrine while warm and allowed to set or cool. Once it has cooled, it can be removed from the mold and sliced similarly to pâté. \n\nHeavy whipping cream is generally preferred to make a creamier, thicker ganache. This pairs well with a dark chocolate between 60-82%. If the chocolate should seize while being mixed with the warm cream, adding tablespoon by tablespoon of hot water to the mixture can remedy the problem.\n\nGanache or \"crème ganache\" was originally a kind of chocolate truffle introduced by the Paris confectioner Maison Siraudin in about 1862 and first documented in 1869. It was named after a popular vaudeville comedy by Victorien Sardou, \"Les Ganaches\" (\"The Chumps\") (1862).\n\n"}

{"id": "26955844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26955844", "title": "List of calques", "text": "List of calques\n\nA calque or loan translation is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word (Latin: \"\"verbum pro verbo\"\") or word-for-word translation. This list contains examples of calques in various languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Romance language expressions calqued from foreign languages include:\n\n\nMany calques found in Southwestern US Spanish, come from English:\nAlso technological terms calqued from English are used throughout the Spanish-speaking world:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: \"From a technical standpoint, Danish and the bokmål standard of Norwegian are the same language, with minor spelling and pronunciation differences (equivalent to British and American English). For this reason, they will share a section.\"\n\n\n\n\nIn more recent times, the Macedonian language has calqued new words from other prestige languages including German, French and English.\n\n\nSome words were originally calqued into Russian and then absorbed into Macedonian, considering the close relatedness of the two languages. Therefore, many of these calques can also be considered Russianisms.\n\nThe poet Aleksandr Pushkin (1799–1837) was perhaps the most influential among the Russian literary figures who would transform the modern Russian language and vastly expand its ability to handle abstract and scientific concepts by importing the sophisticated vocabulary of Western intellectuals.\n\nAlthough some Western vocabulary entered the language as loanwords – e.g., Italian \"salvietta\", \"napkin\", was simply Russified in sound and spelling to салфетка (\"salfetka\") – Pushkin and those he influenced most often preferred to render foreign borrowings into Russian by calquing. Compound words were broken down to their component roots, which were then translated piece-by-piece to their Slavic equivalents. But not all of the coinages caught on and became permanent additions to the lexicon; for example, любомудрие (\"ljubomudrie\") was promoted by 19th-century Russian intellectuals as a calque of \"philosophy\", but the word eventually fell out of fashion, and modern Russian instead uses the loanword философия (\"filosofija\").\n\n\n\n\nSince Finnish, a Uralic language, differs radically in pronunciation and orthography from Indo-European languages, most loans adopted in Finnish either are calques or soon become such as foreign words are translated into Finnish. Examples include:\n\nWhen Jews immigrate to Israel, they often Hebraize their surnames. One approach to doing so was by calque from the original (often German or Yiddish) surname. For instance, Imi Lichtenfield (itself a half-calque), founder of the martial art Krav Maga, became Imi Sde-Or. Both last names mean \"light field\". For more examples and other approaches, see the article on Hebraization of surnames.\n\nAccording to linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the more contributing languages have a structurally identical expression, the more likely it is to be calqued into the target language. In Israeli (his term for \"Modern Hebrew\") one uses \"má nishmà\", lit. \"what's heard?\", with the meaning of \"what's up?\". Zuckermann argues that this is a calque not only of the Yiddish expression \"Was hört sich?\" (usually pronounced \"v(o)sérts´kh\"), but also of the parallel expressions in Polish, Russian and Romanian. Whereas most revivalists were native Yiddish-speakers, many first speakers of Modern Hebrew spoke Russian and Polish too. So a Polish speaker in the 1930s might have used \"má nishmà\" not (only) due to Yiddish \"Was hört sich?\" but rather (also) due to Polish \"Co słychać?\" A Russian Jew might have used \"ma nishma\" due to \"Что слышно?\" (pronounced \"chto slyshno\") and a Romanian Israeli would echo \"ce se aude\". According to Zuckermann, such multi-sourced calquing is a manifestation of the Congruence principle.\n\nModern Malayalam is replete with calques from English. The calques manifest themselves as idioms and expressions and many have gone on to become clichés. However standalone words are very few. The following is a list of commonly used calque phrases/expressions.All of these are exact translations of the corresponding English phrases.\n\n"}

Gâteau Basque with cream is more typical in the Southern Basque region of Spain.\n\nTypically Gâteau Basque is constructed from layers of a wheat flour based cake (a butter-sugar pastry dough, in this case \"pâte sablée\", not \"brisée\") with a filling of either black cherry jam or almond or vanilla pastry cream. It has been argued that only black cherries native to the Basque Country should be used. \n\nThe type of dough used may vary a little. If butter is warmed before mixing with flour the dough will be called \"pâte sucrée\". If it is cold the mixing process will require more work and the dough is called \"pâte sablée\" (it is crumblier). The resulting textures are a little different but mostly for the initiated taster. The flour used is a soft wheat flour with little mineral content (that is, a refined flour, common pastry/cake flour) The proportion of sugar used also varies. But the principle of this cake is having a soft shortbread-type dough 3 to 6 cm thick filled with an almond pastry cream, also called frangipane, and with a shiny egg-coating.\n\nIt is traditional to mark a Basque cross on the top if the cake is filled with black cherry jam, or to use a crosshatch pattern on top if filled with pastry cream.\n\nThe origins of Gâteau Basque are tied strongly with the town of Cambo-les-Bains, Labourd. It may have originally been made with bread and called \"bistochak\" in the 18th century. The fishermen took it out to sea. The first known commercialisation of the cake was by Marianne Hirigoyen in Cambo in the first half of the 19th century. Later editions were flavoured with rum, brought back to France by Basques from the West Indies.\n\nThe Gâteau Basque Festival (\"Fête du Gâteau Basque\") is organized each year in Cambo-les-Bains. \"Eguzkia\" (\"sun\" in Basque), an association to promote quality Basque cake, was founded in France in 1994. There is a museum dedicated to the cake, \"Le musée du Gâteau Basque\", in Sare, Labourd.\n\n\n"}

With the fingers of the right hand, the host takes pieces of grilled meat and offers them to guests. Traditionally, no cutlery is used to serve a mechoui, because, due to the slow cooking of the meat, should be able to be detached without any effort.\n\nThe nomadic populations, in addition to their main herd often composed of several thousand sheep, raise a small number of male lambs specifically for mechoui, feeding them with \"cheih\", a species of wild mugwort which gives the lamb a distinctive character.\n\nAfter having slaughtered and dismembered the young lamb, all the organs of the stomach cavity are removed, with the exception of the kidneys. This cavity is stitched after being sprinkled with spices, particularly ras el hanout. The lamb is skewered on a tree branch and cooked next to a pile of embers. The spindle is rotated slowly and evenly so as to ensure evenly distributed cooking.\n\nThe prepared lamb is not placed directly above the embers, for the melting fat could ignite and char the outer flesh. The cooking is started gently, so that the interior cooks almost at the same time as the outside. During cooking, the meat is brushed with melted butter or oil , to make it crispy. Gradually, the lamb is brought close to the hot embers, so that the flesh takes on an amber color. The cooking time varies according to the weight of the animal, typically about a quarter of an hour per kilogram.\n\nMechoui is prepared, especially in Morocco, by digging a vertical hole, or by constructing an earthen oven, 0.8 to 1 meter in diameter and 1.5 to 2 meters deep. Wood is stacked in this cavity and burns for five or six hours. When the earth surrounding the hole is smoking and the wood is transformed into embers and ashes, most of it is removed to avoid flare-ups. The prepared lamb is added to the oven vertically and enclosed with a lid covered with clay, mud, or wet sand, sealing the lid as well as possible. Cooking lasts four to five hours. When the lamb is done, the hardened cover is broken to remove the lamb from the oven.\n\nTraditionally, méchoui is served with cumin and salt, either on a plate or in a decorative serving dish. The diners sprinkle salt and cumin to taste on the lamb before eating.\n\n"}

Olmeca is owned by the Pernod Ricard Group.\n\nThere are three tequilas in the Olmeca family: Olmeca, Olmeca Altos and Olmeca Tezón - all of which contain Tahona Liquid. Olmeca was launched in 1967 and now has a presence in 80 countries worldwide.\n\nOlmeca is a mix of Tequila.\n\nOlmeca Altos 100% Agave Tequila was launched in November 2009.\n\nOlmeca Tezón is a 100% Agave, 100% Tahona Liquid Tequila.\n\nMade from blue agave picked after 7–8 years of growth. Once harvested, traditional brick ovens are then used to slow cook the piñas.\n\nPart of the production process involves using the 500-year-old traditional and artisan Tahona method, which consists of a 2 tonne millstone made of volcanic rock, known locally as Tezontle. Once the Agave piñas have been harvested and cooked, they are crushed by the Tahona, creating a pulp and drawing out the sweet juice from the fibres. This juice is referred to as Tahona Liquid, of which a percentage is integrated into the fermentation and distillation process of all Olmeca Tequilas, with Olmeca Tezón exclusively containing 100% Tahona Liquid – certified by Consejo Regulador del Tequila.\n\nOlmeca Tequilas are produced at Destileria Colonial de Jalisco. Operation at the plant is overseen by Maestro Tequilero Jesús Hernández and his team of workers. The Master Distiller is responsible for supervising all production, from the harvest of the plants in the agave fields to the bottling of the tequila. The Olmeca distillery is situated in the town of Arandas, Jalisco, the unofficial capital of Los Altos (2104 metres above sea level), taking advantage of the blue agave plants that are grown locally.\n\nSpirit ratings organizations, such as the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and Beverage Testing Institute, have given accolades to some Olmeca tequilas. The best-performing expression of Olmeca, according to ratings aggregator Proof66, is the Altos Blanco. The Altos Blanco was given scores of 94 and 93 in 2011 and 2012 by the Beverage Testing Institute. The 2011 and 2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competitions awarded the Blanco gold and silver medals.\n\n"}

Haystacks are conceptually like a deconstructed tostada. The haystacks ingredients are served individually and assembled on the plate by the person who will be eating it.\n\nHaystacks are composed of relatively small amounts of many ingredients, in flexible combinations, so they are well suited to serving large numbers of people at a low cost. The flexibility and crowd-pleasing nature of haystacks have made them a popular family and small-group choice for at least 60 years. Currently, haystacks are commonly used among three distinct North American religious subcultures: the Seventh-day Adventists, the Mennonites and the Latter-Day Saints.\n\nSeventh-day Adventist haystacks begin with a corn chip base, often Fritos, though larger, restaurant style chips are often used as well, which are typically crushed with the heel of the hand, followed by beans, and grated cheddar cheese. Lettuce, vegetables, and condiments, especially salsa, are typically added last. Many Adventists are vegetarians, and most official or semi-official Adventist cultural dining events are vegetarian, which is one reason haystacks are so popular with this group. Often a soy-based ground hamburger meat alternative is used as an additional haystack ingredient. Haystacks are a common and iconic feature of after-service meals or potlucks, served either at church or in member's homes.\n\nA Seventh-day Adventist named Ella May Hartlein is credited with coming up with the recipe for this version of haystacks in the early 1950s, when she and her family craved Tostadas and could not find a Mexican restaurant close to their home.\n\nThe Amish haystack has less of a Mexican influence, and is less often vegetarian. The Amish haystack is built on a lettuce base, with crushed chips or crackers sprinkled on top, followed by cooked hamburger in tomato, spaghetti-like sauce. The haystack is finished with chopped vegetables, cheese, and any desired condiments. Amish haystacks tend to be associated with community fundraisers for families in need, as opposed to the Adventist haystacks, which are more associated with after-service shared community meals or \"potlucks.\"\n\nIn the Latter-Day Saints community, these are better known as Hawaiian haystacks, so named for their frequent use of pineapple chunks as a topping. In contrast to the Mexican notes characteristic of the Adventist haystack, Mormon or Hawaiian haystacks are characterized by Asian notes, perhaps a function of the long-time presence of the Latter-Day Saints church in Hawaii. Hawaiian haystacks use a white rice base, covered by small pieces of chicken in a sauce or gravy. They are topped by a variety of items, often including the eponymous pineapple chunks, cheddar cheese, celery, tomatoes, sliced almonds, coconut, and chow mein noodles for crunch.\n\nHawaiian haystacks are particularly popular in Utah and other western states where there is a high percentage of Latter-Day Saints. Commonly served at Mormon ward potlucks, Hawaiian haystacks are part of what is sometimes referred to as \"Mormon Cooking\", which also includes such dishes as pretzel jello salad, funeral potatoes and frogeye salad.\n\n\n"}

Azerbaijani myths mainly based on the heroism and wisdom of a human being, which demonstrated in epics such as Epic of Köroğlu, Book of Dede Korkut and \"Əsli və Kərəm\".\n\nThe story of Köroǧlu (lit. son of the blind) begins with his father's loss of sight. The feudal lord Hasan Khan blinds his stable manager Ali Kişi for a trivial offense by plucking out his eyes. Köroǧlu character is supported by several historical evidence. In the late 16th century, the historical Köroǧlu was a leader of jelali rebellion, which broke out Azerbaijan in the border area between Persia and Turkey. Regarding to the Turkish scholar, Pertev Naili Boratov, Turkish sultan ordered to catch the leader of jelali called Köroǧlu (Rushan by name) during the 1580s.\n\nThe character of Korkut is a white-bearded old man who is the narrative of the tale and guardian of the epic tradition. The book of Dede Korkut is known to the modern world from the two manuscripts belong to the late 16th century.\n\nBaba-I Amir was a comic character in Azerbaijani folklore.\n\n“Bayati” is a short and ancient Azeri folk poetry containing four lines with seven syllable in each. They represent human feelings in a poetic form. Several forms of this genre differ from one another according to their telling form and subject. For instance, bayati-baglama, bayati deyishme (competition in saying bayati), vesfi-hal (praising), petting, holavar (labor poems). In these verses, ancient medical cures are mostly emphasized such as water-mint, spearmint, chamomile and basil that used as a treatment.\n\nAshik poetry is known as an ancient folk poetic performance in Caucasus. Poet-singers called ashiks narrated ancient tales and legends with stringed instrument kobuz in Azerbaijan. This way folk tales such as Köroǧlu and The Book of Dede Korkut preserved until today. Köroǧlu heroic dastan is the most famous Azerbaijani ashik epic and narrated by the third person, who is an ashik himself. Basic story spread from the origin place where supposed Anatolia or Azerbaijan into Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan by changing its content and character at every stage. In the Middle East ashiks regarded as a poet, singer, composer or musician. In Azerbaijani, the meaning of ashik is the lover of nature and life and accepted as a creator of national folk music and poetry.\n\nNatural forces were the main subject for the national folklore samples in Azerbaijani folklore and people tried to express them by words or movements. The most popular ceremonial songs and dances were Kosa-Kosa, Godu-Godu, Novruz and Xidir Nabi which show dramatic genres of Azeri folklore.\n\n\nAzerbaijani folklore derives elements from Persian mythology & Turkic mythology.\n\nRegarding to the UNESCO Convention of 20 October 2005, “On the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression” a number of activities have been carried out in the regions of Azerbaijan in order to promote the folklore, culture and art of ethnic groups. Azerbaijan joined to the convention in 2009. Azerbaijan Ministry of Culture and Tourism organizes the festival called “Azerbaijan, the native land” dedicated to the national minorities back in 2006. Within the framework of the festival, various ethnic minorities attend in for presenting their folklore. Internationally broadcasting festival hosts approximately 500 participants from all ethnic regions of Azerbaijan. Festival is presented in English, too. There about 41 music and art schools for children in the regions where ethnic groups are populated. In those schools, folklore and ethnic culture are taught.\n\nAzerbaijan folklore institute was established in 1994 on the base of the Literature Institute named after Nizami Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences (ANAS). Although it has started its activity as an independent structure unit of ANAS since 2003, in the early years of the establishment Cultural Center it acted as a division of the center.\n\nIn 2012, the Department of Folklore and Ethnic Minorities, which is responsible for the collection of folklore samples, was launched in the Folklore Institute of Azerbaijan. The main goal of the department is arranging the preservation and research of the assembled folklore samples.\n\nThere are many books and articles in Persian such as, “Azerbayjan Folklorunden Numunahlar” by Hidayat Hasari and “Folklor Ganjinahsi, Oyunlar” by Zahareh Vafasi have been written about the Azerbaijani folklore, which cover various aspects of the country folklore. Samad Behrangi is a writer who was born in Tabriz in 1939 has written children's stories about Azerbaijani folklore. Yagub Khoshgabani and his wife collected and studied Azerbaijani folklore by travelling and taping folklore records in accordance with the statements of elders.\n\n"}

The Park is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.\n\nJohn Mowlem (1788-1868), a Swanage-born man, was a stonemason and builder. He was the founder of the quarrying and construction company Mowlem. John Mowlem and his nephew and business partner George Burt wanted to give something back to their home town, which was the source of their Portland and Purbeck limestone, popular for building at the time. John Mowlem built the Mowlem Institute, a reading room and public library, in 1862. \n\nGeorge Burt (1816-1894) purchased an undulating tract of land covering Durlston Head during the same year. This estate included quarries that supplied their firm with limestone. Burt developed this estate as a tourist attraction.\n\nBurt established the Durlston Estate on the crest of the hill and built his folly Durlston Castle. The castle was designed by G.R. Crickmay, and was built by W.M. Hardy in 1886-87 entirely of local stone. The 'castle' was never a real castle but rather intended as a restaurant for visitors to his estate. \n\nSouth of Durlston Castle within the Estate grounds is the Great Globe. Constructed in Greenwich in 1887 in Mowlem's stone-yard, it was brought to Swanage by sea. The Globe, which is made of Portland stone, consists of 15 segments, with four stones for each of the lower three courses and three in the top-most course, the segments connected by granite dowels. It measures in diameter and weighs 40 tons. Its surface is carved in detail and lettered to show the continents, oceans and certain more specific areas of the world. In the year of its creation, it was erected by W.M. Hardy upon a platform chopped above sea level into the solid rock of the hill. Around the Globe is a set of stone plaques carved with quotations from English and Roman poets and the Bible, as well as facts about the natural world. These were not completed until 1891.\n\nThere is a stairway leading to the Great Globe. Previously visitors could walk right up to the globe, but now it is protected by an iron fence. Around the globe are eight large stone blocks that represent the compass.\n\nDurlston Country Park has been owned by Dorset County Council since the early 1970s and is open to the public. The Castle was restored during 2010 and 2011 by the Council. Today the castle is the home of the Jurassic Coast Visitor Centre, an exhibition hall and a restaurant. Also within Durlston Country Park and within walking distance of the Globe are Durlston Bay, the Tilly Whim Caves and the Anvil Point Lighthouse.\n\n"}

Ethiopia is where \"Coffea arabica\", the coffee plant, originates. The plant is now grown in various parts of the world; Ethiopia itself accounts for around 3% of the global coffee market. Coffee is important to the economy of Ethiopia; around 60% of foreign income comes from coffee, with an estimated 15 million of the population relying on some aspect of coffee production for their livelihood. In 2006, coffee exports brought in $350 million, equivalent to 34% of that year's total exports.\n\nThe coffee plant, Coffea arabica, originates in Ethiopia. According to legend, the 9th-century goatherder Kaldi discovered the coffee plant after noticing the energizing effect the plant had on his flock, but the story did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.\n\nEthiopia is the world's seventh largest producer of coffee, and Africa's top producer, with 260,000 metric tonnes in 2006. Half of the coffee is consumed by Ethiopians, and the country leads the continent in domestic consumption. The major markets for Ethiopian coffee are the EU (about half of exports), East Asia (about a quarter) and North America. The total area used for coffee cultivation is estimated to be about , the size is unknown due to the fragmented nature of the coffee farms. The way of production has not changed much, with nearly all work, cultivating and drying, still done by hand.\n\nThe revenues from coffee exports account for 10% of the annual government revenue, because of the large share the industry is given very high priority, but there are conscious efforts by the government to reduce the coffee industry's share of the GDP by increasing the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe Tea and Coffee Authority, part of the federal government, handles anything related to coffee and tea, such as fixing the price at which the washing stations buy coffee from the farmers. This is a legacy from a nationalization scheme set in action by the previous regime that turned over all the washing stations to farmers cooperatives. The domestic market is heavily regulated through licenses, with the goal of avoiding market concentration.\n\nEthiopian coffee beans that are grown in either the Harar, Yirgacheffe or Limu regions are kept apart and marketed under their regional name. These regional varieties are trademarked names with the rights owned by Ethiopia.\n\nIt is very likely that in and around this region is where coffee had its origins.\nSidamo coffee is well-balanced with cupping notes exhibiting berries and citrus with complex acidity. The coffee hails from the province of Sidamo in the Ethiopian highlands at elevations from 1,500 up to 2,200 meters above sea level.\nAt these elevations the coffee beans can be qualified as “Strictly High Grown” (SHG). Here the Ethiopian coffees grow more slowly and therefore have more time to absorb nutrients and develop more robust flavors based on the local climate and soil conditions.\n\n\"Ethiopia Genika\" is a type of Arabica coffee of single origin grown exclusively in the Bench Maji Zone of Ethiopia. Like most African coffees, Ethiopia Guraferda features a small and greyish bean, yet is valued for its deep, spice and wine or chocolate-like taste and floral aroma. The most distinctive flavour notes found in all Sidamo coffees are lemon and citrus with bright crisp acidity. Sidamo coffee includes Yirgachefe Coffee and Guji Coffee. Both coffee types are very high quality.\n\nHarar is in the Eastern highlands of Ethiopia. It is one of the oldest coffee beans still produced and is known for its distinctive fruity, wine flavour. The shells of the coffee bean are used in a tea called hasher-qahwa. The bean is medium in size with a greenish-yellowish colour. It has medium acidity and full body and a distinctive mocha flavour. Harar is a dry processed coffee bean with sorting and processing done almost entirely by hand. Though processing is done by hand, the laborers are extremely knowledgeable of how each bean is categorized.\n\nEthiopian coffee beans of the species \"Coffea arabica\" can be divided into three categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry varieties consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and flavour. Shortberry varieties are smaller than the Longberry beans but, are considered a high grade bean in Eastern Ethiopia where it originates. Also the Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are known for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.\n\nOn 26 October 2006, Oxfam accused Starbucks of asking the National Coffee Association (NCA) to block a US trademark application from Ethiopia for three of the country's coffee beans, Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe. They claimed this could result in denying Ethiopian coffee farmers potential annual earnings of up to £47m.\n\nEthiopia and Oxfam America urged Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement with Ethiopia to help boost prices paid to farmers. At issue was Starbucks' use of Ethiopia's famed coffee brands—Guji, Sidamo, Yirgacheffe and Harar—that generate high margins for Starbucks and cost consumers a premium, yet generated very low prices to Ethiopian farmers.\n\nRobert Nelson, the head of the NCA, added that his organization initiated the opposition for economic reasons, \"For the U.S. industry to exist, we must have an economically stable coffee industry in the producing world ... This particular scheme is going to hurt the Ethiopian coffee farmers economically.\" The NCA claimed the Ethiopian government was being badly advised and this move could price them out of the market.\n\nFacing more than 92,000 letters of concern, Starbucks had placed pamphlets in its stores accusing Oxfam of \"misleading behavior\" and insisting that its \"campaign need[s] to stop\". On 7 November, \"The Economist\" derided Oxfam's \"simplistic\" stance and Ethiopia's \"economically illiterate\" government, arguing that Starbucks' (and Illy's) standards-based approach would ultimately benefit farmers more. In conclusion of this issue, on 20 June 2007, representatives of the Government of Ethiopia and senior leaders from Starbucks Coffee Company announced that they had executed an agreement regarding distribution, marketing and licensing that recognizes the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee designations. Financial terms regarding this agreement were not disclosed.\n\nStarbucks, as part of the deal, also was set to market Ethiopian coffee during two promotional periods in 2008. A Starbucks spokesman said the announcement is \"another development\" in the relationship with Ethiopia and a way to raise the profile of Ethiopian coffee around the world.\n\nAn Oxfam spokesman said the deal sounds like a \"useful step\" as long as farmers are benefiting, and it's a big step from a year ago when Starbucks \"wasn't engaging directly (with) Ethiopians on adding value to their coffee\".\n\n\n"}

Microplastics are not a specific kind of plastic, but rather any type of plastic fragment that is less than five millimeters in length according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They enter natural ecosystems from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to, cosmetics, clothing, and industrial processes.\n\nTwo classifications of microplastics currently exist. Primary microplastics are any plastic fragments or particles that are already 5.0 mm in size or less before entering the environment. These include microfibers from clothing, microbeads, and plastic pellets (also known as nurdles). Secondary microplastics are microplastics that are created from the degradation of larger plastic products once they enter the environment through natural weathering processes. Such sources of secondary microplastics include water and soda bottles, fishing nets, and plastic bags. Both types are recognized to persist in the environment at high levels, particularly in aquatic and marine ecosystems. \n\nAdditionally, plastics degrade slowly, often over hundreds if not thousands of years. This increases the probability of microplastics being ingested and incorporated into, and accumulated in, the bodies and tissues of many organisms. The entire cycle and movement of microplastics in the environment is not yet known, but research is currently underway to investigate this issue.\n\nMicroplastics are common in our world today. In 2014, it was estimated that there are between 15 and 51 trillion individual pieces of microplastic in the world’s oceans, which was estimated to weigh between 93,000 and 236,000 metric tons.\n\nPrimary microplastics are small pieces of plastic that are purposefully manufactured. They are usually used in facial cleansers and cosmetics, or in air blasting technology. In some cases, their use in medicine as vectors for drugs was reported. Microplastic \"scrubbers\", used in exfoliating hand cleansers and facial scrubs, have replaced traditionally used natural ingredients, including ground almonds, oatmeal, and pumice. Primary microplastics have also been produced for use in air blasting technology. This process involves blasting acrylic, melamine, or polyester microplastic scrubbers at machinery, engines, and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium, chromium, and lead. Although many companies have committed to reducing the production of microbeads, there are still many bioplastic microbeads that also have a long degradation life cycle similar to normal plastic.\n\nSecondary plastics are small pieces of plastic derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, both at sea and on land. Over time, a culmination of physical, biological, and chemphotodegradation, including photodegradation caused by sunlight exposure, can reduce the structural integrity of plastic debris to a size that is eventually undetectable to the naked eye. This process of breaking down large plastic material into much smaller pieces is known as fragmentation. It is considered that microplastics might further degrade to be smaller in size, although the smallest microplastic reportedly detected in the oceans at present is 1.6 micrometres (6.3×10 in) in diameter. The prevalence of microplastics with uneven shapes suggests that fragmentation is a key source.\n\nThere are countless sources of both primary and secondary microplastics. Microplastic fibers enter the environment from the washing of synthetic clothing. Tires, composed partly of synthetic styrene butadiene rubber, will erode into tiny plastic and rubber particles as they are used. Furthermore, 2.0-5.0 mm plastic pellets, used to create other plastic products, often enter ecosystems due to spillages and other accidents. A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about microplastics published in early 2015 states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as microplastics from these sources are added from human society at the \"start of the pipe\", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.\n\nThe existence of microplastics in the environment is often established through aquatic studies. These include taking plankton samples, analyzing sandy and muddy sediments, observing vertebrate and invertebrate consumption, and evaluating chemical pollutant interactions. Through such methods, it has been shown that there are microplastics from multiple sources in the environment.\n\nMicroplastics could contribute up to 30% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch polluting the world’s oceans and, in many developed countries, are a bigger source of marine plastic pollution than the visible larger pieces of marine litter, according to a 2017 IUCN report.\n\nSewage treatment plants, also known as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), remove contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage, using various physical, chemical, and biological processes. Most plants in developed countries have both primary and secondary treatment stages. In the primary stage of treatment, physical processes are employed to remove oils, sand, and other large solids using conventional filters, clarifiers, and settling tanks. Secondary treatment uses biological processes involving bacteria and protozoa to break down organic matter. Common secondary technologies are activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and constructed wetlands. The optional tertiary treatment stage may include processes for nutrient removal (nitrogen and phosphorus) and disinfection.\n\nMicroplastics have been detected in both the primary and secondary treatment stages of the plants. A study estimated that about one particle per liter of microplastics are being released back into the environment, with a removal efficiency of about 99.9%. A 2016 study showed that most microplastics are actually removed during the primary treatment stage where solid skimming and sludge settling are used. When these treatment facilities are functioning properly, the contribution of microplastics into oceans and surface water environments from WWTPs is not disproportionately large.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that in certain countries sewage sludge is used for soil fertilizer, which exposes plastics in the sludge to the weather, sunlight, and other biological factors, causing fragmentation. As a result, microplastics from these biosolids often end up in storm drains and eventually into bodies of water. In addition, some studies show that microplastics do pass through filtration processes at some WWTPs (Microplastics as Contaminants, 2011). According to a study from the UK, samples taken from sewage sludge disposal sites on the coasts of six continents contained an average one particle of microplastic per liter. A significant amount of these particles was of clothing fibers from washing machine effluent.\n\nWear and tear from tires significantly contributes to the flow of (micro-)plastics into the environment. Estimates of emissions of microplastics to the environment in Denmark are between per year. Secondary microplastics (e.g. from car and truck tires or footwear) are more important than primary microplastics by two orders of magnitude. The formation of microplastics from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment is not accounted for in the study.\n\nThe estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tires (100%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tires (2%), artificial turf (12–50%), brake wear (8%), and road markings (5%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tire wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5–10%. In air, 3–7% of the particulate matter (PM) is estimated to consist of tire wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enter our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks.\n\nSome companies have replaced natural exfoliating ingredients with microplastics, usually in the form of \"microbeads\" or \"micro-exfoliates\". These products are typically composed of polyethylene, a common component of plastics, but they can also be manufactured from polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and nylon. They are often found in face washes, hand soaps, and other personal care products, so the beads are usually washed into the sewage system immediately after use. Their small size prevents them from fully being retained by preliminary treatment screens at wastewater plants, thereby allowing some to enter rivers and oceans. In fact, wastewater treatment plants only remove an average of 95–99.9% of microbeads because of their small design . This leaves an average of 0-7 microbeads per litre being discharged. Considering that one treatment plant discharges 160 trillion liters of water per day, around 8 trillion microbeads are released into waterways every day. This number doesn’t account for the sewage sludge that is reused as fertilizer after the waste water treatment that has been known to still contain these microbeads.\n\nThis is an issue at the household level because it has been estimated that around 808 trillion beads per household are discharged in a single day whether due to cosmetic exfoliates, face wash, toothpaste, or other sources. Although many companies have committed to phasing out the use of microbeads in their products, according to research, there are at least 80 different facial scrub products that are still being sold with microbeads as a main component. This contributes to the 80 metric tons of microbead discharge per year by the United Kingdom alone, which not only has a negative impact upon the wildlife and food chain, but also upon levels of toxicity, as microbeads have been proven to absorb dangerous chemicals such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\n\nStudies have shown that many synthetic fibers, such as polyester, nylon and acrylics, can be shed from clothing and persist in the environment. Each garment in a load of laundry can shed more than 1,900 fibers of microplastics, with fleeces releasing the highest percentage of fibers, over 170% more than other garments. Washing machine manufacturers have also reviewed research into whether washing machine filters can reduce the amount of microfiber fibers that need to be treated by water treatment facilities. These microfibers have been found to persist throughout the food chain from zooplankton to larger animals such as whales. The primary fiber that persist throughout the textile industry is polyester which is a cheap cotton alternative that can be easily manufactured. However, these types of fibers contribute greatly to the persistence to microplastics in terrestrial, aerial, and marine ecosystems. The process of washing clothes causes garments to lose an average of over 100 fibers per liter of water. This has been linked with health effects possibly caused by the release of monomers, dispersive dyes, mordants, and plasticisers from manufacturing. The commonality of these types of fibers in the common households has been shown to represent 33% of all fibers in indoor environments.\n\nAnthropomorphic fibers have been studied in both indoor and outdoor environments to study the concentration of these to see what the average human exposure to microfibers look like. The indoor concentration was 1.0–60.0 fibers/m^3 whereas the outdoor concentration was much lower at 0.3-1.5 fibers/m^3. The deposition rate indoors was 1586-11,130 fibers per day/m^3 which accumulates to around 190-670 fibers/mg of dust. The largest concern with these concentrations is that it increases exposure to children and the elderly which can cause adverse health effects.\n\nThe manufacture of plastic products uses granules and small resin pellets as their raw material. In the United States, production increased from 2.9 million pellets in 1960 to 21.7 million pellets in 1987. Through accidental spillage during land or sea transport, inappropriate use as packing materials, and direct outflow from processing plants, these raw materials can enter aquatic ecosystems. In an assessment of Swedish waters using an 80 µm mesh, KIMO Sweden found typical microplastic concentrations of 150–2,400 microplastics per m; in a harbor adjacent to a plastic production facility, the concentration was 102,000 per m.\n\nMany industrial sites in which convenient raw plastics are frequently used are located near bodies of water. If spilled during production, these materials may leak into the surrounding environment, polluting waterways. “More recently, Operation Cleansweep (www.opcleansweep.org), a joint initiative of the American Chemistry Council and Society of the Plastics Industry, is aiming for industries to commit to zero pellet loss during their operations”. Overall, there is a significant lack of research conducted about specific industries and companies that contribute to microplastics pollution.\n\nRecreational and commercial fishing, marine vessels, and marine industries are all sources of plastic that can directly enter the marine environment, posing a risk to biota both as macroplastics, and as secondary microplastics following long-term degradation. Marine debris observed on beaches also arises from beaching of materials carried on inshore and ocean currents. Fishing gear is a form of plastic debris with a marine source. Discarded or lost fishing gear, including plastic monofilament line and nylon netting, is typically neutrally buoyant and can, therefore, drift at variable depths within the oceans. Various countries have reported that microplastics from the industry and other sources have been accumulating in different types of seafood. In Indonesia, 55% of all fish species had evidence of manufactured debris similar to America which reported 67%. However, the majority of debris in Indonesia was plastic, while in North America the majority was synthetic fibers found in clothing and some types of nets. The implication that fish are being contaminated with microplastic is that those plastics and chemicals will bioaccumulate in the food chain.\n\nOne study analyzed the plastic-derived chemical called polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the stomachs of short-tailed shearwaters. It found that one-fourth of the birds had higher-brominated congeners that are not naturally found in their prey. However, the PBDE got into the birds' systems through plastic that was found in the stomachs of the birds. It is therefore not just the plastics that are being transferred through the food chain but the chemicals from the plastics as well.\n\nShipping has significantly contributed to marine pollution. Some statistics indicate that in 1970, commercial shipping fleets around the world dumped over 23,000 tons of plastic waste into the marine environment. In 1988, an international agreement (MARPOL 73/78, Annex V) prohibited the dumping of waste from ships into the marine environment. However, shipping remains a dominant source of plastic pollution, having contributed around 6.5 million tons of plastic in the early 1990s. Research has shown that approximately 10% of the plastic found on the beaches in Hawaii are nurdles. In one incident on July 24th, 2012, 150 tonnes of nurdles and other raw plastic material spilled from a shipping vessel off the coast near Hong Kong after a major storm. This waste from the Chinese company Sinopec was reported to have piled up in large quantities on beaches. While this is a large incident of spillage, researchers speculate that smaller accidents also occur and further contribute to marine microplastic pollution. \n\nIn one study, 93% of the bottled water from 11 different brands showed microplastic contamination. Per liter, researchers found an average of 325 microplastic particles. Of the tested brands, Nestlé Pure Life and Gerolsteiner bottles contained the most microplastic with 930 and 807 microplastic particles per liter (MPP/L), respectively. San Pellegrino products showed the least quantity of microplastic densities. Compared to water from taps, water from plastic bottles contained twice as much microplastic. Some of the contamination likely comes from the process of bottling and packaging the water.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive review of scientific evidence published by the European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism in 2019, microplastics are now present in every part of the environment. While there is no evidence of widespread ecological risk from microplastic pollution yet, risks are likely to become widespread within a century if pollution continues at its current rate.\n\nParticipants at the 2008 International Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris at the University of Washington at Tacoma concluded that microplastics are a problem in the marine environment, based on:\n\nSo far, research has mainly focused on larger plastic items. Widely-recognized problems facing marine life are entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation often leading to death and/or strandings. This causes serious public concern. In contrast, microplastics are not as conspicuous, being less than 5  mm, and are usually invisible to the naked eye. Particles of this size are available to a much broader range of species, enter the food chain at the bottom, become embedded in animal tissue, and are then undetectable by unaided visual inspection.\n\nMicroplastics have been detected not just in marine but also in freshwater systems in three continents (Europe, North America and Asia). Samples collected across 29 Great Lakes tributaries from six states in the United States were found to contain plastic particles, 98% of which were microplastics ranging in size from 0.355mm to 4.75mm.\n\nMicroplastics can become embedded in animals' tissue through ingestion or respiration. Various annelid species, such as deposit-feeding lugworms (\"Arenicola marina\"), have been shown to have microplastics embedded in their gastrointestinal tracts. Many crustaceans, like the shore crab \"Carcinus maenas\", have been seen to integrate microplastics into both their respiratory and digestive tracts.\n\nAdditionally, bottom feeders, such as benthic sea cucumbers, who are non-selective scavengers that feed on debris on the ocean floor, ingest large amounts of sediment. It has been shown that four species of sea cucumber (\"Thyonella gemmate\", \"Holothuria floridana\", \"H. grisea\" and \"Cucumaria frondosa\") ingested between 2- and 20-fold more PVC fragments and between 2- and 138-fold more nylon line fragments (as much as 517 fibers per organism) based on plastic-to-sand grain ratios from each sediment treatment. These results suggest that individuals may be selectively ingesting plastic particles. This contradicts the accepted indiscriminate feeding strategy of sea cucumbers, and may occur in all presumed non-selective feeders when presented with microplastics.\n\nNot only fish and free-living organisms can ingest microplastics. Scleractinian corals, which are primary reef-builders, have been shown to ingest microplastics under laboratory conditions. While the effects of ingestion on these corals has not been studied, corals can easily become stressed and bleach. Microplastics have been shown to stick to the exterior of the corals after exposure in the laboratory. The adherence to the outside of corals can potentially be harmful, because corals cannot handle sediment or any particulate matter on their exterior and slough it off by secreting mucus, and they expend a large amount of energy in the process, increasing the chances of mortality.\n\nZooplankton ingest microplastics beads (1.7–30.6 μm) and excrete fecal matter contaminated with microplastics. Along with ingestion, the microplastics stick to the appendages and exoskeleton of the zooplankton. Zooplankton, among other marine organisms, consume microplastics because they emit similar infochemicals, notably dimethyl sulfide, just as phytoplankton do. Plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and polypropylene (PP) produce dimethyl sulfide odors. These types of plastics are commonly found in plastic bags, bleach, food storage containers, and bottle caps.\n\nIt can take at least 14 days for microplastics to pass through an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' gills can prevent elimination entirely. When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders. For example, scientists have reported plastic accumulation in the stomachs of lantern fish which are small filter feeders and are the main prey for commercial fish like tuna and swordfish. Microplastics also absorb chemical pollutants that can be transferred into the organism's tissues. Small animals are at risk of reduced food intake due to false satiation and resulting starvation or other physical harm from the microplastics.\n\nA study done at the Argentinean coastline of the Rio de la Plata estuary, found the presence of microplastics in the guts of 11 species of coastal freshwater fish. These 11 species of fish represented four different feeding habits: detritivore, planktivore, omnivore and ichthyophagous. This study is one of the few so far to show the ingestion of microplastics by freshwater organisms.\n\nFish is a significant source of protein for the human population, accounting for 6.1% of all protein consumed globally in 2007. The microplastics ingested by fish and crustaceans can be subsequently consumed by humans as the end of the food chain. In a study done at the State University of New York, 18 fish species were sampled and all species showed some level of plastics in their systems. Many additional researchers have found evidence that these fibers had become chemically associated with metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other toxic contaminants while in water. The microplastic-metal complex can then enter humans via consumption.\n\nThe primary concern with human health in regards to microplastics is more directed towards the different toxic and carcinogenic chemicals used to make these plastics and what they carry. It has also been thought that microplastics can act as a vector for pathogens as well as heavy metals. More specifically, pregnant women in particular are in danger of causing birth defects to male infants such as anogenital distance, penile width, and testicular descent. This comes from phthalate exposure and DEHP metabolites that interfere with the development of the male reproductive tract.\n\nBPA is a commonly well-known substance that is an ingredient used to harden plastic that can also cause a wide range of disorders. Cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and abnormalities in liver enzymes are a few disorders that can arise from even small exposure to this chemical. Although these effects have been more widely studied than other types of plastics, it is still used in the production of much clothing (polyester).\n\nAnother dangerous ingredient is called Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) which is a flame retardant in many different types of plastics such as those used in microcircuits. This chemical has been linked to disruptions in thyroid hormones balance, pituitary function, and infertility. The endocrine system is affected by TBBPA through disruption of the natural T3 functions with the nuclear suspension in pituitary and thyroid.\n\nMany people can expect to come in contact with various types of microplastics on a daily basis in the aforementioned sources (see sources). However, the average citizen is exposed to microplastics through their various types of food included in a normal diet. For instance: Salt. Researchers in China tested three types of table salt samples available in supermarkets and found the presence of microplastics in all of them. Sea salt has the highest amounts of microplastics compared to lake salt and rock/well salt. Sea salt and rock salt which are commonly used table salts in Spain have also been found to contain microplastics. The most common type of microplastic found in both these studies was polyethylene terephthalate (PET).\n\nAn example of bioaccumulation in the food chain that leads to human exposure was a study done into the tissue samples of mussels to approximate concentration of microplastics. After research scientists estimate that an average citizen might be exposed to 123 MP articles/year/capita of microplastics through mussel consumption in the UK. Considering different diets it was also estimated that the microplastic exposure could go up to 4,620 particles/y/capita in countries with a higher shellfish consumption. However, it is also important to note that the humans on average are exposed to microplastics more in household dust than consuming mussels.\n\nA 2018 study conducted on eight individuals from Europe and Japan found microplastics in human feces for the first time. All participants were found positive for at least one type of microplastics after all of them had consumed plastic-wrapped food and drunk water from plastic bottles while six had also eaten seafood. It was noted though that the study was small-sized, preliminary and unable to reveal the true origin of the plastic particles.\n\nAccording to a comprehensive review of scientific evidence published by the European Union's Scientific Advice Mechanism in 2019, \"little is known with respect to the human health risks of nano- and microplastics, and what is known is surrounded by considerable uncertainty\". The authors of the review identify the main limitations as the quality or methodology of the research to date. Since \"the poison is in the dose\", the review concludes that \"there is a need to understand the potential modes of toxicity for different size-shape-type NMP combinations in carefully selected human models, before robust conclusions about ‘real’ human risks can be made\".\n\nApproximately half of the plastic material introduced to the marine environment is buoyant, but fouling by organisms can cause plastic debris to sink to the sea floor, where it may interfere with sediment-dwelling species and sedimental gas exchange processes. Several factors contribute to microplastic’s buoyancy, including the density of the plastic it is composed as well as the size and shape of the microplastic fragments themselves. Microplastics can also form a buoyant biofilm layer on the ocean’s surface. Buoyancy changes in relation to ingestion of microplastics have been clearly observed in autotrophs because the absorption can interfere with photosynthesis and subsequent gas levels. However, this issue is of more importance for larger plastic debris.\n\nPlastic particles may highly concentrate and transport synthetic organic compounds (e.g. persistent organic pollutants, POPs), commonly present in the environment and ambient seawater, on their surface through adsorption. Microplastics can act as carriers for the transfer of POPs from the environment to organisms.\n\nAdditives added to plastics during manufacture may leach out upon ingestion, potentially causing serious harm to the organism. Endocrine disruption by plastic additives may affect the reproductive health of humans and wildlife alike.\n\nPlastics, polymers derived from mineral oils, are virtually non-biodegradable. However, renewable natural polymers are now in development which can be used for the production of biodegradable materials similar to that of oil-based polymers.\n\nThere is truly a staggering amount of microplastics in our world’s oceans. Though there is debate over exactly how much microplastic is in the world’s oceans a 2015 study estimated that there was between 93 and 236 thousand metric tons of microplastics in the world’s oceans. A study of the distribution of Eastern Pacific Ocean surface plastic debris helps to illustrate how the concentration of plastics in the ocean is on the rise. Though the study admits further research is needed to predict trends in ocean plastic concentration, the study, using data on surface plastic concentration (pieces of plastic km) from 1972-1985 n=60 and 2002-2012 n=457 within the same plastic accumulation zone, found the mean plastic concentration increase between the two sets of data, including a 10-fold increase of 18,160 to 189,800 pieces of plastic km. And though this study is based on data of surface plastic concentration, not specifically microplastic, additional research has found microplastics to account for 92% of plastic debris on the ocean’s surface, which adds context to the study.\n\nThough there have only been a few studies of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, microplastics are being increasingly detected in the world’s aquatic environments. The first study on microplastics in freshwater ecosystems was published in 2011 that found an average of 37.8 fragments per square meter of Lake Huron sediment samples. Additionally, studies have found MP (microplastic) to be present in all of the Great Lakes with an average concentration of 43,000 MP particle km. Microplastics have also been detected in freshwater ecosystems outside of the United States. The highest concentration of microplastic ever discovered in a studied freshwater ecosystem was recorded in the Rhine river at 4000 MP particles kg.\n\nA substantial portion of microplastics are expected to end up in the world’s soil, yet very little research has been conducted on microplastics in soil. There exists some speculation that fibrous secondary microplastics from washing machines could end up in soil through the failure of water treatment plants to completely filter out all of the microplastic fibers. Furthermore, geophagous soil fauna, such as earthworms, mites, and collembolan could contribute to the amount of secondary microplastic present in soil by converting consumed plastic debris into microplastic via digestive processes. Further research, however, is needed. There is concrete data linking one the use of organic waste materials to synthetic fibers being found in the soil; but most studies on plastics in soil merely report its presence and do not quantify how much there is or where it came from.\n\nAirborne microplastics have been detected in the atmosphere, as well as indoors and outdoors. A 2017 study found indoor airborne microfiber concentrations between 1.0–60.0 microfibers per cubic meter (33% of which were found to be microplastics). Another study looked at microplastic in the street dust of Tehran and found 2,649 particles of microplastic within 10 samples of street dust, with ranging samples concentrations from 83 particle – 605 particles (+/- 10) per 30.0 g of street dust. However, much like freshwater ecosystems and soil, more studies are needed to understand the full impact and significance of airborne microplastics.\n\nSome researchers have proposed incinerating plastics to use as energy, which is known as energy recovery. As opposed to losing the energy from plastics into the atmosphere in landfills, this process turns some of the plastics back into energy that can be used. However, as opposed to recycling, this method does not diminish the amount of plastic material that is produced. Therefore, recycling plastics is considered a more efficient solution.\n\nIncreasing education through recycling campaigns is another proposed solution for microplastic contamination. While this would be a smaller scale solution, education has been shown to reduce littering, especially in urban environments where there are often large concentrations of plastic waste. If recycling efforts are increased, a cycle of plastic use and reuse would be created to decrease our waste output and production of new raw materials. In order to achieve this, states would need to employ stronger infrastructure and investment around recycling. Some advocate for improving recycling technology to be able to recycle smaller plastics to reduce the need for production of new plastics.\n\nBiodegradation is another possible solution to large amounts of microplastic waste. In this process, microorganisms consume and decompose synthetic polymers with using degrading enzymes. These plastics can then be used in the form of energy and as a source of carbon once broken down. The microbes could potentially be used to treat sewage wastewater, which would decrease the amount of microplastics that pass through into the surrounding environments.\n\nWith increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of microplastics on the environment, groups are now advocating for the removal and ban of microplastics from various products. One such campaign is \"Beat the Microbead\", which focuses on removing plastics from personal care products. The Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation run the Global Microplastics Initiative, a project to collect water samples to provide scientists with better data about microplastic dispersion in the environment. UNESCO has sponsored research and global assessment programs due to the trans-boundary issue that microplastic pollution constitutes. These environmental groups will keep pressuring companies to remove plastics from their products in order to maintain healthy ecosystems.\n\nIn the US, some states have taken action to mitigate the negative environmental effects of microplastics. Illinois was the first US state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics. On the national level, the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015 was enacted after being signed by President Barack Obama on December 28, 2015. The law bans \"rinse-off\" cosmetic products that perform an exfoliating function, such as toothpaste or face wash. It does not apply to other products such as household cleaners. The act took effect on July 1, 2017, with respect to manufacturing, and July 1, 2018, with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce.\n\nOn July 25th, 2018, a microplastic reduction amendment was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. The legislation, as part of the Save Our Seas Act designed to combat marine pollution, aims to support the NOAA's Marine Debris Program. In particular, the amendment is geared towards promoting NOAA’s Great Lakes Land-Based Marine Debris Action Plan to increase testing, cleanup, and education around plastic pollution in the Great Lakes. President Donald Trump signed the re-authorization and amendment bill into effect on October 11, 2018.\n\nOn June 15th, 2018, the Japanese government passed a bill with the goal of reducing microplastic production and pollution, especially in aquatic environments. Proposed by the Environment Ministry and passed unanimously by the Upper House, this is also the first bill to pass in Japan that is specifically targeted at reducing microplastic production, specifically in the personal care industry with products such as face wash and toothpaste. This law is revised from previous legislation, which focused on removing plastic marine debris. It also focuses on increasing education and public awareness surrounding recycling and plastic waste. The Environment Ministry has also proposed a number of recommendations for methods to monitor microplastic quantities in the ocean (Recommendations, 2018). However, the legislation does not specify any penalties for those who continue manufacturing products with microplastics.\n\nThe European Commission has noted the increased concern about the impact of microplastics on the environment. In April 2018, the European Commission's Group of Chief Scientific Advisors commissioned a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence on microplastic pollution through the EU's Scientific Advice Mechanism. The evidence review was conducted by a working group nominated by European academies and delivered in January 2019. A Scientific Opinion based on will be presented to the European Commission later in 2019, on the basis of which the Commission will consider whether policy changes should be proposed at a European level to curb microplastic pollution. In January 2019, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) proposed to restrict intentionally added microplastics.\n\nThe \"Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017\" law from passed by the UK government bans the production of any rinse-off personal care products (such as exfoliants) containing microbeads. This particular law denotes specific penalties when it is not obeyed. Those who do not comply are required to pay a fine. In the event that a fine is not paid, product manufacturers may receive a stop notice, which prevents the manufacturer from continuing production until they have followed regulation preventing the use of microbeads. Criminal proceedings may occur if the stop notice is ignored.\n\nOn April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded The Garbage patch state under the patronage of UNESCO and the Italian Ministry of the Environment.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched its \"Trash-Free Waters\" initiative in 2013 to prevent single-use plastic wastes from ending up in waterways and ultimately the ocean. EPA collaborates with the United Nations Environment Programme–Caribbean Environment Programme (UNEP-CEP) and the Peace Corps to reduce and also remove trash in the Caribbean Sea. EPA has also funded various projects in the San Francisco Bay Area including one that is aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics such as disposable cups, spoons and straws, from three University of California campuses.\n\nAdditionally, there are many organizations advocating action to counter microplastics and that is spreading microplastic awareness. One such group is the Florida Microplastic Awareness Project (FMAP), a group of volunteers who search for microplastics in coastal water samples.\n\nComputer modelling done by The Ocean Cleanup, a Netherlands foundation, has suggested that collecting devices placed nearer to the coasts could remove about 31% of the microplastics in the area.

{"id": "27306509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27306509", "title": "Operationsbefehl Hartmut", "text": "Operationsbefehl Hartmut\n\nOperationsbefehl Hartmut (literally \"Operation Order Hartmut\") was the code word to begin German submarine operations during Operation Weserübung - Nazi Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway. Occasionally these operations are termed Operation Hartmut. The orders involved submarine screening actions for the German invasion fleet and reconnaissance - particularly off Narvik and Trondheim. The orders also resulted in a number of attacks on Allied forces - particularly in or near the fjords of the Norwegian coast.\n\nThe operation's reconnaissance and screening objectives succeeded for the most part, however Hartmut is notable for the large number of faulty torpedoes fired and four U-boats sunk. These problems came at a time when the war in the Atlantic was still going exceptionally well against Britain. The deployment of U-boats during Operation Weserübung is occasionally criticized as a waste of manpower and materiel for this reason. The use of magnetic pistols and operations in cold weather rendered the G7e torpedo less effective. Coastal operations may have also hampered commanders used to the open sea. Speculation persists that massive torpedo failure during this campaign provoked German naval high command into improving the weapon's performance. U-boat commanders like Prien, Schultze and Schütze had the only patrols of their careers without any tonnage sunk.\n\nFirst hints of an impending invasion of Norway and Denmark came in March 1940. By early April, most of the U-boats to be used for Operation Hartmut as part of Operation Weserübung were ready. BdU Karl Dönitz intermittently sent ships to reconnoitre areas of the Norwegian coast and to try to locate portions of the British fleet.\n\nDue to submarines' generally slow surface speed compared to surface vessels, many of the U-boats specifically assigned to perform in Operation Weserübung departed before the main surface fleet left from the mouth of the Weser river on the morning of 7 April. Twenty U-boats went out on 3, 4 and 5 April.\n\nPreparations in the German submarine forces (U-bootwaffe) began in early March. On 4 March 1940 Karl Dönitz received orders from his superiors in Berlin:\n\nDönitz mobilized any vessel that could dive. Only 12 larger Type VII and Type IX submarines capable of operating in the Atlantic Ocean were fit for the operation. One older ocean-going Type IA was also included. 12 smaller Type II U-boats were called up, despite that the Norwegian coast limited their operating time. The operation subsequently disrupted training exercises in the Baltic Sea as six outdated Type IIA training submarines were brought into the North Sea.\n\nAt this point, commanders and crews were simply ordered into the North Sea. A sealed envelope aboard each of the U-boats held their official orders. The envelope was to be opened upon receiving the radio code word \"Hartmut\" (hence the attributed name Operation Hartmut).\n\nDönitz predicted spectacular results for his submarines. In his memoirs he wrote, \"Undoubtedly the enemy would react sharply to the landing of German troops in Norway. Their operations could be directed at our occupied ports or their own facilities - that is, strategically important sites for the English... The enemy was also bound to the narrow waterways of the fjords; their ships would have to pass near the U-boats. They could only go unseen in very turbulent weather. The deployment of multiple u-boats in staggered formation would likely yield more shooting opportunities.\"\n\nBy the beginning of April 1940, 31 U-boats were ready for operations between England and Norway. On 6 April, the codeword \"Hartmut\" was transmitted and German submarines began their designated operations.\n\nGerman submarines operating near the Norwegian coast made numerous attacks on British ships, although many proved unsuccessful due to faulty torpedoes.\n\n\"U-4\" sank the British T-class submarine HMS \"Thistle\".\n\n\"U-13\" sank the British steam merchant \"Swainby\" off the Shetland islands with one torpedo on 17 April.\n\nAfter docking in Bergen for a short time, \"U-13\" then sank the Danish vessel \"Lily\" that had been taken as a prize by the British after the German occupation of Denmark. The first torpedo failed to arm, but the second broke the ship in half. A few days later \"U-13\" damaged another British ship before returning to port.\n\n\"U-37\" sank one Swedish tanker, one Norwegian freighter and one British freighter equalling 18,715 tons of shipping between 10 and 12 April.\n\nThere were two naval battles of Narvik on 10 April 1940 and 13 April 1940. and were positioned at the entrance of the fjord. When the Royal Navy arrived, \"U-38\" fired at and at missing both. In the second battle, U-38 fired at but the torpedoes detonated prematurely.\n\n\"U-47\" under Günther Prien encountered \"a wall of ships\" on 15 April. A British fleet of cruisers and transport ships were anchored near Narvik offloading troops and war materials. Prien targeted two cruisers and two transports with the four forward torpedoes but none detonated. An hour and a half later after a thorough inspection of the tubes and torpedoes, Prien tried again. Again, with a textbook surfaced attack from 750m away using four torpedoes \"U-47\" had no success. One detonated underwater after hitting a rock, well off course.\n\nAfter leaving Ofotfjord, \"U-47\" spotted and attacked HMS \"Warspite\". One torpedo detonated ahead of the battleship, while another detonated far behind. \"U-47\" spent the next hours submerged under persistent depth charge attack.\n\n\"U-48\" under Herbert Schultze made multiple attacks on a fleet of three cruisers on 10 April, but the torpedoes failed to arm or detonated prematurely. Later on 14 April, \"U-48\" attacked HMS \"Warspite\" but both torpedoes failed to detonate. \"Warspite\"s destroyer screen fired on the vessel and \"U-48\" was depth charged, but escaped destruction.\n\n\"U-51\" attacked a destroyer, but the torpedoes detonated prematurely. On 19 April, commander Dietrich Knorr attacked the French cruiser \"Émile Bertin\", but both torpedoes missed.\n\nHans-Gerrit von Stockhausen commanding \"U-65\" attacked a group of British destroyers, but the torpedoes missed or failed to arm. The U-boat subsequently suffered moderate damage when the same destroyers depth charged her.\n\nU-boats succeeded in reporting some Allied fleet movements, but Dönitz' greatest interest was sinking ships - a portion of Hartmut where the U-boats performed underwhelmingly. In general, submarine attacks in the Norwegian waters proved ineffective. Nearly two-thirds of the magnetic pistols failed by either detonating too early, not arming, or running too deep.\n\nDespite orders to cease using magnetic pistols in late 1939, Dönitz had authorized commanders to use either magnetic or impact pistols on their torpedoes during Operation Weserübung. Cold water in the North Sea and Norwegian fjords hampered the use of electric torpedoes used at the time, which required heating to reach suitable operating temperature.\n\nOther speculation has pointed to the unfamiliar conditions of the campaign for the abnormally large number of torpedo failures. Most commanders were used to operating at sea where the effect of tides and currents over short distances is negligible between a boat and its target. Underwater movement may have significantly affected torpedoes, by throwing them off course or making them run too deep - potentially explaining at least part of the missed shots and torpedo failures.\n\nFour submarines were also lost - three ocean-going submarines consisting of two VIIBs and one IXB along with one older IIA.\n\nOperation Hartmut engaged nearly every submarine in Germany's navy - most notably, both antiquated Type IA submarines and all six of Germany's IIA coastal submarines, which were operating as training boats in the Baltic. Boats which were initially unavailable for action at the beginning of the operation took part in ferrying supplies or patrolling later on.\n\nWhen Hartmut was issued on 6 April 1940 the German plan designated the U-bootwaffe into eight groups (along with a further Group Seven, which was cancelled).\n\nPatrol Area: Narvik, Harstad, Westfjord, Vagsfjord\n\nPatrol Area: Trondheim, Namsos, Romsdalsfjord\n\nPatrol Area: Bergen, Aalesund, Shetland Islands\n\nPatrol Area: Stavanger\n\nPatrol Area: East of the Shetland Islands, Vagsfjord, Trondheim\n\n\nPatrol Area: Pentland, Orkney islands, Shetland Islands\n\nNever assembled. Group Seven was designated to patrol the Eastern entrance to the English Channel, but was cancelled.\n\nPatrol Area: Lindesnes, Egernsund\n\nPatrol Area: Bergen, Shetland Islands; SW of the Norwegian Coast.\n\nThese U-boats began patrols during the timeframe of Operation Weserübung, but were not fit for service (either due to damage, command changes or other reasons) during the beginning of Hartmut. These submarines generally operated in the area of the Orkney islands, Shetland Islands, and near Bergen.\n\n\n\n"}

These tastes are native flavour which mostly acquired from plant and vegetables.\n\nOriginally, it was made from any available edible young leaves and raw vegetables known by Sundanese since ancient times. Today, though, most \"lalab\" consists of sliced cabbage, cucumbers, lettuce, green beans, yardlong beans, tomatoes, \"leunca\", lemon basil, spinach, water spinach, cassava leaves, papaya leaves, chayote, and small, green eggplant. Sometimes, other exotic vegetables also are used, such as green, stinky \"petai\" and \"jengkol\" bean.\n\nAlthough most \"lalab\" vegetables are only washed in cold water and served raw, some boiled, steamed and fried variations are also available; for example, \"petai\" green beans can be served either raw or fried, while \"labu siam\" (chayote), water spinach and cassava leaves are usually served boiled.\n\nWhile most of vegetables are served raw or simply boiled or blanched, the main flavouring agent is its dressing, the hot and spicy \"sambal terasi\" which is chili paste in \"terasi\" shrimp paste.

The mini dress featured a flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack, on the front, and a white CND symbol emblazoned on the black-coloured back of the dress. The next day the images of the dress made the front page of various newspapers around the world, and is now remembered as one of the most iconic pop moments of the 1990s and Brit Awards history. The dress has become synonymous with the Spice Girls, Halliwell and the notions of Girl Power, and Cool Britannia.\n\nAccording to \"The Daily Telegraph\", the dress came top in a 2010 online poll to find the 10 most iconic dresses of the past 50 years, beating other memorable garments such as Marilyn Monroe's white 'Seven Year Itch' halterneck and the wedding dress of Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2016, the dress was voted the \"Most Inspiring British Fashion Moment\" in an online poll conducted by British online retailer Very.\n\nIn 2010, the performance in the Union Jack dress won Most Memorable Performance of 30 Years at the Brit Awards. The dress held the \"Guinness World Record\" for the most expensive piece of popstar clothing dealt at auction when it was sold for £41,320 in 1998.\n\nAt the 1997 BRIT Awards the Spice Girls were scheduled to perform, as well as being nominated for five awards, two of which they won. The black Gucci mini dress which Halliwell was given to perform in concerned her, as she thought it was too \"boring\". Then Halliwell decided she wanted to \"celebrate being British\", so she asked her sister to stitch on a Union Jack tea towel to the front as a patriotic gesture. After Karen, her sister, had sewn on the tea towel, Geri decided to wear it whilst performing \"Who Do You Think You Are\" (with excerpts of \"Wannabe\" in) at the BRIT Awards on 24 February 1997. \n\nIn 1998, a year after Halliwell performed in the dress, she auctioned it off at the London branch of Sotheby's for £41,320. The buyer was Peter Morton, on behalf of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, who displayed the piece of clothing as pop memorabilia. Morton bid via telephone, and beat other bidders such as \"The Sun\". Halliwell herself watched the \"frenzied bid\", and rapped the gavel after the final bid. The dress was originally valued at £12,000, but eventually it netted £36,200 (which, with the 15% commission, totalled it to £41,320). Halliwell gave the proceeds of the dress sale to a children's cancer care charity. The BBC commented on the sale, saying it \"marks the end of Geri's links with the Girl Power image of the past\". It holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of popstar clothing dealt at auction. The dress was one of many items of Spice Girls memorabilia sold at the auction, where total sales reached £146,511 for charity.\nThe 1998 auction, with Halliwell auctioning off the Union Jack dress as the final lot, can be seen in the documentary \"Geri\", by documentary film-maker Molly Dineen.\n\n For the 2007 Spice Girls reunion tour, named the Return of the Spice Girls, fashion designer Roberto Cavalli designed Halliwell a new Union Jack dress modelled on the original. The new version appeared slightly longer and the flag was made out of rhinestones and Swarovski crystals.

{"id": "27704937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27704937", "title": "Bap (food)", "text": "Bap (food)\n\nBap () is a Korean name of cooked rice prepared by boiling rice and/or other grains, such as black rice, barley, sorghum, various millets, and beans, until the water has cooked away. Special ingredients such as vegetables, seafood, and meat can also be added to create different kinds of \"bap\".\n\nIn Korean, the honorific forms of \"bap\" (meal) include jinji () for an elderly, sura () for the monarch, and me () for the deceased (in the ancestral rites).\n\nTraditionally, \"bap\" was made using \"gamasot\" (a cast iron cauldron) for a large family, however in modern times an electronic rice cooker is usually used to cook rice. Regular heavy-bottomed pot or \"dolsot\" (stone pot) can also be used. Nowadays, rice cooked in \"gamasot\" or \"dolsot\" are called \"sotbap\", and are considered as delicacies. More nurungji (scorched rice) is produced when making \"gamasot-bap\" (cast iron cauldron rice) and \"dolsot-bap\" (stone pot rice).\n\nTo make \"bap\", rice is scrubbed in water and rinsed several times. This process produces \"tteumul\" (water from the last washing of rice). It is then soaked for thirty minutes before boiling, which helps the grains cook evenly. With unpolished brown rice and bigger grains such as yulmu (\"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"ma-yuen\"), it is necessary to soak the grains for several hours to overnight to avoid under-cooking. The grains are then cooked. In a regular heavy bottomed pot, rice can be cooked over medium high heat with the lid on for about ten minutes, stirred, and then left to simmer on low heat for additional five to ten minutes.\n\nThe scorched rice in the bottom of the pot or cauldron, \"nurungji\", can be eaten as snacks or used to make \"sungnyung\" (an infusion made from boiling scorched rice).\n\nBap refers to the Korean cooked rice. The Bap is a popular staple dish in Korea and also signifies the Culinary Corpus of Koreans (Chung et al. 2017). The Bap meal offers significant nutrition and energy and is widely considered as medicinal by many Koreans. It has high stickiness and sheen, hence easy to digest due to possession of adequate moisture (Chung et al. 2017). As a result, the Bap meal signifies the Korean cultural concern for medicinal aid from natural products rather than artificial ones. The dish remains one of the most popular in the Korean Cuisine due to its uniqueness from normal cooked rice and added nutritional values.The most basic \"bap\" made of rice is called \"ssalbap\" (, \"rice bap\"), or often just \"bap\". As rice itself occurs in colours other than white, the \"bap\" made of all white rice is called \"huinssal-bap\" (, \"white rice bap\") or \"ssalbap\". When black rice is mixed, it is called \"heungmi-bap\" (, \"black rice bap\").\n\nWhen cooked with all brown rice (unpolished rice) or white rice mixed with brown rice, it is called \"hyeonmi-bap\" (, \"brown rice bap\"), while \"bap\" cooked with all glutinous rice or white rice mixed with glutinous rice is called \"chapssal-bap\" (, \"glutinous rice bap\"). Unpolished glutinous rice can also be used to cook \"bap,\" in which case it is called \"hyeonmi-chapssal-bap\" (, \"brown glutinous rice bap\").\n\n\"Bap\" made of regular non-glutinous white rice (polished rice) can be referred to as \"baekmi-bap\" (, \"white rice bap\") when compared to \"hyeonmibap\", and as \"mepssal-bap\" (, \"non-glutinous rice bap\") when compared to \"chalbap\"/\"chapssalbap\".\n\n\"Bap\" made of rice mixed with various other grains is called \"japgok-bap\" (, \"multi-grain rice\"). On the day of Daeboreum, the first full moon of the year, Koreans eat \"ogok-bap\" (, \"five-grain rice\") made of glutinous rice, proso millet, sorghum, black beans, and red bean, or \"chalbap\" (, \"sticky rice\") made of glutinous rice, red bean, chestnut, jujube, and black beans.\n\nWhen rice is mixed with one other grain, the \"bap\" is named after the mixed ingredient. The examples are:\n\nSome grains can be cooked without rice. \"Bap\" made of barley without rice is called \"kkong-bori-bap\" (), while \"bap\" made of both rice and barley is called \"bori-bap\" ().\n\n\"Byeolmi-bap\" (, \"special delicacy rice\") or \"byeolbap\" (, \"special rice\") can be made by mixing in special ingredients such as vegetables, seafood, and meat. For example, \"namul-bap\" (, \"namul rice\") is made of rice mixed with namul vegetables. Some popular \"byeolmibap\" varieties include:\n\nThere are many bap dishes such as bibimbap (, \"mixed rice\"), \"bokkeum-bap\" (, \"fried rice\") and \"gimbap\" (, \"seaweed rice\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27763693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27763693", "title": "Moving Day (New York City)", "text": "Moving Day (New York City)\n\nMoving Day was a tradition in New York City dating back to colonial times and lasting until after World War II. On February 1, sometimes known as \"Rent Day\", landlords would give notice to their tenants what the new rent would be after the end of the quarter, the tenants would spend good-weather days in the early spring searching for new houses and the best deals and on the first of May all leases in the city expired simultaneously at 9:00 am, causing thousands of people to change their residences, all at the same time.\n\nLocal legend has it that the tradition began because the first of May was the day the first Dutch settlers set out for Manhattan, but \"The Encyclopedia of New York City\" links it instead to the English celebration of May Day. While it may have originated as a custom, the tradition took force of law by an 1820 act of the New York State legislature, which mandated that if no other date was specified, all housing contracts were valid to the first of May – unless the day fell on a Sunday, in which case the deadline was May 2.\n\nIn 1799, an observer commented that New Yorkers \"are seized on the first of May, by a sort of madness, that will not let them rest till they have changed their dwelling.\" Because there were not enough cartmen to handle all the traffic, farmers would come from Long Island and New Jersey to rent out their wagons at high prices. By 1820, because of the large increase in the number of propertyless renters, Moving Day had become \"pandemonium\", with the streets gridlocked with wagons carting household goods. The tradition was still in force in 1848, when the Tenant League denounced it as a way for landlords to raise rents every year. The cost of moving was another concern, as cartmen sometimes charged more than the official rates set by city ordinances – people were known to pay up to a week's wages to be moved – and the truckman might, if the customer refused to pay on delivery, take their belongings to Police Headquarters, charging for the additional transportation.\n\nBy 1856, some erosion of the strict adherence to the custom of Moving Day was noted, as some people moved a few days before or after the traditional day, creating, in effect, a \"moving week\". Once the economic depression of 1873 was over, more housing was constructed, dropping the price of housing down, and subsequently people had less need to move as often.\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, many people began leaving the city for the cooler suburbs in the heat of summertime, and as a result October 1 became a second Moving Day, as people returning to the city would take their belongings out of storage and move into their newly rented homes. The October date may be related to the English custom of paying land rents on Michaelmas, which falls on September 29. Eventually, the October date began to supplant the traditional May date, so that by 1922 the Van Owners Association reported only a \"moderate flurry\" of activity on the Spring day. The movers also attempted to get legislation passed to spread out the Fall rush to three dates: the firsts of September, October and November. Over time, the tradition of a specific Moving Day began to fade, with the remnant evident in commercial leases, which still generally run out on May 1 or October 1.\n\nAt the height of Moving Day in the early 20th century, it was estimated that a million people in the city all changed their residences at the same time. Resistance to Moving Day was strong in the 1920s and 1930s, but it took the start of World War II to end the general practice, as the moving industry found it difficult to find able-bodied men to do the work. The post-war housing shortage and the advent of rent control finally put an end to the custom for good. By 1945, a newspaper headline announced \"Housing Shortage Erases Moving Day.\"\n\nIn her 1832 book \"Domestic Manners of Americans\", English writer Frances Trollope, mother of novelist Anthony Trollope, described the city on Moving Day:\n\nOn the 1st of May the city of New York has the appearance of sending off a population flying from the plague, or of a town which had surrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods and chattels. Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, wagons, and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, and draymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from east to west, from north to south, on this day. Every one I spoke to on the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, but all assured me it was unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house. More than one of my New York friends have built or bought houses solely to avoid this annual inconvenience.\n\nJohn Pintard, a co-founder of the New-York Historical Society described moving day in a letter to his daughter Eliza in 1832 or 1833:\n\nTuesday 1st May. Hazy, raw. Yest[erda]y was very unfavorable for the general moving of our great city. High rents, incommodious dwellings, & necessity combine to crowd our streets with carts overloaded with furniture & hand barrows with sofas, chairs, sideboards, looking glasses & pictures, so as to render the sidewalks almost impassable. The practice of all moving on one day, & give up & hiring Houses in Feb[ruar]y is of an antient custom & when the city was small & inhabitants few in number, almost every body owned or continued for years tenants in the same houses. Few instances of removals were seen, but now N[ew] York is literally in an uproar for several days before & after the 1st of May. This practice of move all, to strangers appears absurd, but it is attended with the advantage of affording a greater choice of abodes in the Feb[ruar]y quarter.\n\nFrontiersman Davey Crockett described his experience of Moving Day when he came to the city to be guest of honor at a dinner given by the Whig Party in 1834:\n\nBy the time we returned down Broadway, it seemed to me that the city was flying before some awful calamity. \"Why,\" said I, \"Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off.\" He laughed, and said this was the general \"moving day.\" Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal to get me out of my log-house; but here, I understand, many persons \"move\" every year.\n\n\"Mrs. Felton\", in her 1843 book \"American Life: A Narrative of Two Years' City And Country Residence in the United States\" gives another Englishwoman's perspective on the tradition:\n\nBy an established custom, the houses are let from this day [May 1st] for the term of one year certain; and, as the inhabitants in general love variety, and seldom reside in the same house for two consecutive years, those who have to change, which appears to be nearly the whole city, must be all removed together. Hence, from the peep of day till twilight, may be seen carts which go at a rate of speed astonishingly rapid, laden with furniture of every kind, racing up and down the city, as if its inhabitants were flying from a pestilence, pursued by death with his broad scythe just ready to mow them into eternity.\n\nIn 1855, the \"New York Times\" look forward to that year's Moving Day:\n\nIt will begin early – before some of us are up, no doubt, and it will continue late. The sidewalks will be worse obstructed in every street than Wall-street is where the brokers are in full blast. Old beds and ricketty bedstands, handsome pianos and kitchen furniture, will be chaotically huddled together. Everything will be in a muddle. Everybody in a hurry, smashing mirrors in his haste, and carefully guarding boot boxes from harm. Sofas that go out sound will go in maimed, tables that enjoyed castors will scratch along and \"tip\" on one less than its complement. Bed-screws will be lost in the confusion, and many a good piece of furniture badly bruised in consequence. Family pictures will be sadly marred, and the china will be a broken set before night, in many a house. All houses will be dirty – never so dirty – into which people move, and the dirt of the old will seem enviable beside the cleanliness of the new. The old people will in their hearts murmur at these moving dispensations. The younger people, though aching in every bone, and \"tired to death,\" will relish the change, and think the new closets more roomy and more nice, and delight themselves fancying how this piece of furniture will look here and that piece in the other corner. The still \"younger ones\" will still more enjoy it. Into the cellar and upon the roof, into the rat-holes and on the yard fence, into each room and prying into every cupboard, they mill make reprisals of many things \"worth saving,\" and mark the day white in their calendar, as little less to be longed for in the return than Fourth of July itself.Keep your tempers, good people. Don't growl at the carmen nor haggle over the price charged. When the scratched furniture comes in don't believe it is utterly ruined, – a few nails, a little glue, a piece of putty, and a pint of varnish will rejuvenate many articles that will grow very old 'twixt morning and night, and undo much of the mischief that comes of moving, and which at first sight seems irreparable.\n\nGeorge Templeton Strong, a prominent New York lawyer, described Moving Day in his diary:\n\nMay 1. Fine weather, to the great comfort of the locomotive public. Never knew the city in such a chaotic state. Every other house seems to be disgorging itself into the street; all the sidewalks are lumbered with bureaus and bedsteads to the utter destruction of their character as thoroughfares, and all the space between the sidewalks is occupied by long processions of carts and wagons and vehicles omnigenous laden with perilous piles of moveables. We certainly haven't advanced as a people beyond the nomadic or migratory stage of civilization analogous to that of the pastoral cow feeders of the Tartar Steppes.\n\nIn 1865, the \"Times\" described the attitude of the \"carmen\" on Moving Day:\n\nOn the 1st of May, too, the carman becomes a different creature. Not particularly civil at any time, on moving day he must be approached with caution. He has become lord of the ascendant. Ordinary offers do not tempt him. He has been known to laugh to scorn a man who offered him $5 to convey a load half a dozen blocks. He declines making any previous engagements. He seeks no customers, but rather conveys the idea that he would prefer to be let alone. At the same time he keeps a sharp eye to business, and only accepts an offer when he knows he can't beat a cent more out of his customer. And then when be is engaged, he goes about his work with supremest indifference. ... He is above all ordinances; he is a creation of the day; to-morrow he will be a mere carman, amenable to law and standing in fear of the Mayor's Marshal.\n\nLydia Maria Child, the editor of the abolitionist newspaper \"National Anti-Slavery Standard\", described Moving Day in her \"Letters from New-York\":\n\n[A]ll New-York moves on the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the everlasting hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the world seems to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, they sit on the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world. And I, who have almost as strong a love of localities as poor puss, turn away from the windows, with a suppressed anathema on the nineteenth century, with its perpetual changes. Do you want an appropriate emblem of this country, and this age? Then stand on the side-walks of New-York, and watch the universal transit on the first of May ... However, human being are such creatures of habit and imitation, that what is necessity soon becomes fashion, and each one wishes to do what everyone else is doing. A lady in the neighbourhood closed all her binds and shutters, on May-day; being asked by her acquaintance whether she had been in the country, she answered, \"I was ashamed not to be moving on the first of May; and so I shut up the house that the neighbours might not know it.\" One could not well imagine a fact more characteristic of the despotic sway of custom and public opinion, in the United States, and the nineteenth century.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It is a part of popular depictions of Native Americans in various novels, e.g. those of James Fenimore Cooper or Karl May.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) uses [] (\"how\") for the spelling, and claims Jean de Brébeuf had described the use of the term as an interjection of approval with the Wyandot (Hurons). De Brébeuf described individual speakers using \"Condayauendi Ierhayde cha nonhwicwahachen\" to signify the end of their speaking, which was answered by the community with a long \"Hooow\".\n\nLongman Webster describes \"Howgh\" as a greeting of the Sioux; giving \"Háu kola\" (\"Hallo friend\") as a Lakota Sioux greeting. However, it would be the only Lakota term using a diphthong and is probably of external origin. Dakota and Omaha Sioux use slightly different versions. Francis Parkman, in his book gives a first-person account of three weeks spent hunting buffalo, with a band of Oglala Sioux, in 1846. He mentions their use of \"How\". Today, neither the Hurons nor the Lakota use the term, as by 1900 \"Good morning\" was the preferred greeting.\n\nKarl May uses Howgh similar to the Schweizerdeutsch closing particle \"Ha gschlosse\", which is used by the speaker to indicate they are done speaking. In both cases, the term expresses a strict Rule of Order, and a longing for consensus.\n\n\"Howgh\", \"Uff!\", Manitou and Lakota \"Hoka Hey\" have had a major influence on the popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries. \"Howgh\" gained popularity as symbols of Native Americans through Cooper's and Parkman's books. By 1917 it was so stereotypically accepted that it found its way into US World War I propaganda depicting Native American soldiers.By 1953 it was so completely accepted that in Walt Disney's Peter Pan movie, the song \"What Made the Red Man Red?\" uses \"How\" and \"Ugh\" with the strong assumption that the contemporary audience would understand them as standard Native American speech.\n\n\"Howgh\" found some applications in German songs depicting Native Americans, as in \"Indianer\" by Nena (lyrics by Carlo Karges) and Gus Backus \"Da sprach der alte Häuptling der Indianer\" (the old Indian chieftain spoke, covered e.g. by Wildecker Herzbuben and Wirtschaftswunder ). It was even part of the social media parodies of German minister of finance Peer Steinbrück's use of Western movie metaphors against Swiss tax policy 2009. Raymond Steadman was irritated by the usage of what he viewed as a stereotypical phrase, and closed with \"Reader gettum sick? Have-um enough?\"\n\n"}

{"id": "27886658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27886658", "title": "Tripiṭaka", "text": "Tripiṭaka\n\nThe Tripiṭaka (Sanskrit ) or Tipiṭaka (Pali ), is the traditional term for the Buddhist scriptures. The version canonical to Theravada Buddhism is generally referred to in English as the Pali Canon. Mahayana Buddhism also holds the \"Tripiṭaka\" to be authoritative but, unlike Theravadins, it also includes in its canon various derivative literature and commentaries that were composed much later.\n\nThe \"Tripiṭaka\" was composed between about 500 BCE to about the start of the common era, likely written down for the first time in the 1st century BCE. The Dipavamsa states that during the reign of Valagamba of Anuradhapura (29–17 BCE) the monks who had previously remembered the Tripiṭaka and its commentary orally now wrote them down in books, because of the threat posed by famine and war. The Mahavamsa also refers briefly to the writing down of the canon and the commentaries at this time. Each Buddhist sub-tradition had its own Tripiṭaka for its monasteries, written by its sangha, each set consisting of 32 books, in three parts or baskets of teachings: (“Basket of Discipline”), (“Basket of Discourse”), and \"Abhidharma Piṭaka\" (“Basket of Special [or Further] Doctrine”). The structure, the code of conduct and moral virtues in the Vinaya basket particularly, have similarities to some of the surviving Dharmasutra texts of Hinduism. Much of the surviving Tripiṭaka literature is in Pali, with some in Sanskrit as well as other local Asian languages.\n\n\"\" (Sanskrit) or \"Tipiṭaka\" (Pali) literally translates as 'Three Baskets' (\"Piṭaka\" (पिटक) or \"pita\" (पिट), meaning \"basket or box made from bamboo or wood\"). The 'three baskets' were originally the receptacles of the palm-leaf manuscripts in which were preserved the \"Sutta Piṭaka\", the \"Vinaya Piṭaka\" and the \"Abhidhamma Piṭaka\", the three divisions that constitute the Pali Canon. These terms are also spelled without diacritics as \"Tripiṭaka\" and \"Tipiṭaka\" in scholarly literature.\n\nThe dating of the \"Tripiṭaka\" is unclear. Max Muller states that the current structure and contents of the Pali Canon took shape in the third century BCE after which it continued to be transmitted orally from generation to generation (just like the Vedas and the early Upanishads) until finally being put into written form in the 1st century BCE (nearly 500 years after the lifetime of Buddha).\n\nAccording to A. K. Warder, the Tibetan historian Bu-ston said that around or before the 1st century CE there were eighteen schools of Buddhism and their Tripiṭakas were written down by then. However, except for one version that has survived in full and others, of which parts have survived, all of these texts are lost to history or yet to be found. \n\nThe \"Tripiṭaka\" was compiled and put into writing for the first time during the reign of King Walagambahu of Sri Lanka (1st century BCE). According to Sri Lankan sources more than 1000 monks who had attained Arahantship were involved in the task. The place where the project was undertaken was in Aluvihare, Matale, Sri Lanka. The resulting texts were translated into four related Indo-European languages of South Asia: Sanskrit, Pali, Paisaci and Prakrit, sometime between 1st century BCE and 7th century CE. Portions of these were later translated into a number of East Asian languages such as Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian by ancient visiting scholars, which though extensive are incomplete.\n\nWu and Chia state that emerging evidence, though uncertain, suggests that the earliest written Buddhist Tripiṭaka texts may have arrived in China from India by the 1st century BCE.\n\nThe \"Tripiṭaka\" is composed of three main categories of texts that collectively constitute the Buddhist canon: the \"Sutta Piṭaka\", the \"Vinaya Piṭaka\", and the \"Abhidhamma Piṭaka\". The \"Sūtra Piṭaka\" is older than the \"Vinaya Piṭaka\", and the \"Abhidharma Piṭaka\" represents a later tradition of scholastic analysis and systematization of the contents of the S\"utta Piṭaka\" originating at least two centuries after the other two parts of the canon. The \"Vinaya Piṭaka\" appears to have grown gradually as a commentary and justification of the monastic code (Prātimokṣa), which presupposes a transition from a community of wandering mendicants (the \"Sūtra Piṭaka\" period ) to a more sedentary monastic community (the \"Vinaya Piṭaka\" period). Even within the \"Sūtra Piṭaka\" it is possible to detect older and later texts.\n\nRules and regulations of monastic life that range from dress code and dietary rules to prohibitions of certain personal conducts.\n\nThe Buddha delivered all his sermons in Magadhan, the local language of north-eastern India where the Buddha was born, raised and educated. These sermons were rehearsed orally during the meeting of the First Buddhist council just after the Parinibbana of the Buddha. The teachings continued to be transmitted orally until they were written down in the first century BCE.\n\nPhilosophical and psychological analysis and interpretation of Buddhist doctrine.\n\nEach of the Early Buddhist Schools likely had their own recensions of the \"Tripiṭaka\". According to some sources, there were some Indian schools of Buddhism that had five or seven piṭakas.\n\nThe \"Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya\" was translated by Buddhabhadra and Faxian in 416 CE, and is preserved in Chinese translation (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1425).\n\nThe 6th century CE Indian monk Paramārtha wrote that 200 years after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha, much of the Mahāsāṃghika school moved north of Rājagṛha, and were divided over whether the Mahāyāna sūtras should be incorporated formally into their \"Tripiṭaka\". According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these Mahāyāna texts. Paramārtha states that the Kukkuṭika sect did not accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as \"buddhavacana\" (\"words of the Buddha\"), while the Lokottaravāda sect and the Ekavyāvahārika sect did accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as \"buddhavacana\". Also in the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes of the Mahāsāṃghikas using a \"Great Āgama Piṭaka,\" which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the \"Prajñāparamitā\" and the \"Daśabhūmika Sūtra\".\n\nAccording to some sources, abhidharma was not accepted as canonical by the Mahāsāṃghika school. The Theravādin \"Dīpavaṃsa\", for example, records that the Mahāsāṃghikas had no abhidharma. However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma, and the Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanzang both mention Mahāsāṃghika abhidharma. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at Nāgārjunakoṇḍā, Joseph Walser concludes that at least some Mahāsāṃghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.\n\nThe Caitikas included a number of sub-sects including the Pūrvaśailas, Aparaśailas, Siddhārthikas, and Rājagirikas. In the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes that Mahāyāna sūtras such as the \"Prajñāparamitā\" and others are chanted by the Aparaśailas and the Pūrvaśailas. Also in the 6th century CE, Bhāvaviveka speaks of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Pūrvaśailas and Aparaśailas both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, implying collections of Mahāyāna texts within these Caitika schools.\n\nThe Bahuśrutīya school is said to have included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka in their canon. The ', also called the ', is an extant abhidharma from the Bahuśrutīya school. This abhidharma was translated into Chinese in sixteen fascicles (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1646). Its authorship is attributed to Harivarman, a third-century monk from central India. Paramārtha cites this Bahuśrutīya abhidharma as containing a combination of Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna doctrines, and Joseph Walser agrees that this assessment is correct.\n\nThe Prajñaptivādins held that the Buddha's teachings in the various piṭakas were nominal (Skt. \"prajñapti\"), conventional (Skt. \"\"), and causal (Skt. \"hetuphala\"). Therefore, all teachings were viewed by the Prajñaptivādins as being of provisional importance, since they cannot contain the ultimate truth. It has been observed that this view of the Buddha's teachings is very close to the fully developed position of the Mahāyāna sūtras. \n\nScholars at present have \"a nearly complete collection of sūtras from the Sarvāstivāda school\" thanks to a recent discovery in Afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of Dīrgha Āgama in Sanskrit. The Madhyama Āgama (Taishō Tripiṭaka 26) was translated by Gautama Saṃghadeva, and is available in Chinese. The Saṃyukta Āgama (Taishō Tripiṭaka 99) was translated by Guṇabhadra, also available in Chinese translation. The Sarvāstivāda is therefore the only early school besides the Theravada for which we have a roughly complete Sūtra Piṭaka. The Sārvāstivāda Vinaya Piṭaka is also extant in Chinese translation, as are the seven books of the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma Piṭaka. There is also the encyclopedic \"Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra\" (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1545), which was held as canonical by the Vaibhāṣika Sarvāstivādins of northwest India.\n\nPortions of the Mūlasārvāstivāda Tripiṭaka survive in Tibetan translation and Nepalese manuscripts. The relationship of the Mūlasārvāstivāda school to Sarvāstivāda school is indeterminate; their vinayas certainly differed but it is not clear that their Sūtra Piṭaka did. The Gilgit manuscripts may contain Āgamas from the Mūlasārvāstivāda school in Sanskrit. The Mūlasārvāstivāda Vinaya Piṭaka survives in Tibetan translation and also in Chinese translation (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1442). The Gilgit manuscripts also contain vinaya texts from the Mūlasārvāstivāda school in Sanskrit.\n\nA complete version of the Dīrgha Āgama (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1) of the Dharmaguptaka school was translated into Chinese by Buddhayaśas and Zhu Fonian (竺佛念) in the Later Qin dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 sūtras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin Dīgha Nikāya. A. K. Warder also associates the extant \"Ekottara Āgama\" (\"Taishō Tripiṭaka\" 125) with the Dharmaguptaka school, due to the number of rules for monastics, which corresponds to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya is also extant in Chinese translation (\"Taishō Tripiṭaka\" 1428), and Buddhist monastics in East Asia adhere to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.\n\nThe Dharmaguptaka Tripiṭaka is said to have contained a total of five piṭakas. These included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka and a Mantra Piṭaka (Ch. 咒藏), also sometimes called a Dhāraṇī Piṭaka. According to the 5th century Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhayaśas, the translator of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the Mahāyāna Tripiṭaka (Ch. 大乘三藏).\n\nThe Mahīśāsaka Vinaya is preserved in Chinese translation (Taishō Tripiṭaka 1421), translated by Buddhajīva and Zhu Daosheng in 424 CE.\n\nSmall portions of the of the Kāśyapīya school survive in Chinese translation. An incomplete Chinese translation of the Saṃyukta Āgama of the Kāśyapīya school by an unknown translator circa the Three Qin (三秦) period (352-431 CE) survives.\n\nThe complete Tripiṭaka set of the Theravāda school is written and preserved in Pali in the Pali Canon. Buddhists of the Theravāda school use the Pali variant \"Tipiṭaka\" to refer what is commonly known in English as the Pali Canon.\n\nThe term had tended to become synonymous with Buddhist scriptures, and thus continued to be used for the Chinese and Tibetan collections, although their general divisions do not match a strict division into three piṭakas. \n\nAn organised collection of Buddhist texts began to emerge in the 6th century, based on the structure of early bibliographies of Buddhist texts. However, it was the 'Kaiyuan Era Catalogue' by Zhisheng in 730 that provided the lasting structure. Zhisheng introduced the basic six-fold division with sutra, vinaya, and abhidharma belonging to Mahāyāna and Hīnayana. It is likely that Zhisheng's catalogue proved decisive because it was used to reconstruct the Canon after the persecutions of 845 CE, however it was also considered a \"perfect synthesis of the entire four-hundred-year development of a proper Chinese form of the Canon.\" \n\nThe Chinese form of , \"sānzàng\" (三藏), was sometimes used as an honorary title for a Buddhist monk who has mastered the teachings of the Tripiṭaka. In Chinese culture, this is notable in the case of the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang, whose pilgrimage to India to study and bring Buddhist texts back to China was portrayed in the novel \"Journey to the West\" as \"Tang Sanzang\" (Tang Dynasty Tripiṭaka Master). Due to the popularity of the novel, the term \"sānzàng\" is often erroneously understood as a name of the monk Xuanzang. One such screen version of this is the popular 1979 Monkey (TV series).\n\nThe modern Indian scholar Rahul Sankrityayan is sometimes referred to as \"Tripiṭakacharya\" in reflection of his familiarity with the .\n\n\n\nPali Canon:\n\nMyanmar Version of Buddhist Canon (6th revision):\n\nChinese Buddhist Canon:\n\nTibetan tradition:\n\nTripiṭaka collections:\n\nSri Lankan version of Tipiṭaka:\n"}

Both types are also called \"arselle\" in Liguria and Tuscany. In America small cherrystone clams may be substituted.\n\nItalians prepare this dish two ways: \"in bianco\", i.e., with oil, garlic, parsley, and sometimes a splash of white wine; and \"in rosso\", like the former but with tomatoes and fresh basil, the addition of tomatoes being more frequent in the south. Traditionally, the bivalves are cooked quickly in hot olive oil to which plenty of garlic has been added. The live clams open during cooking, releasing a liquid that serves as the primary flavoring agent. The clams are then added to the firm pasta (spaghetti, linguine, or vermicelli), along with salt, black pepper (or red pepper), and a handful of finely chopped parsley.\n\nIn the Liguria region of Italy, east of Genoa, \"Spaghetti alle vongole (veraci)\" means spaghetti with tiny baby clams in the shell, no more than the size of a thumbnail, with a white wine/garlic sauce. Linguine also may be used for the pasta in preference to spaghetti.\n\nItalian-American recipes sometimes use cream in this dish, but in its area of origin this would be considered most unorthodox. Gillian Riley considers cream alien to the spirit of Italian cooking, remarking that, \"the way cream dumbs down flavor and texture is not appropriate to the subtle flavor and consistency of pasta.\" . Italian-born experts such as Marcella Hazan, however, give recipes for pasta sauces with cream, such as her \"Pink Shrimp Sauce with Cream\", and cream is a feature of Northern Italian cuisines. \n\nIn America cheese is sometimes added to this dish, although Italians believe it overpowers the simple flavors of the clams and of good quality olive oil.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27954947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27954947", "title": "Apeiron", "text": "Apeiron\n\nApeiron (; ) is a Greek word meaning \"(that which is) unlimited,\" \"boundless\", \"infinite\", or \"indefinite\" from \"a-\", \"without\" and \"peirar\", \"end, limit\", \"boundary\", the Ionic Greek form of \"peras\", \"end, limit, boundary\". It is akin to Persian \"piramon\", meaning \"boundary, circumference, surrounding\".\n\nThe \"apeiron\" is central to the cosmological theory created by Anaximander, a 6th-century BC pre-Socratic Greek philosopher whose work is mostly lost. From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (\"arche\") is eternal and infinite, or boundless (\"apeiron\"), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. \"Apeiron\" generated the opposites (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world (cf. Heraclitus). Everything is generated from \"apeiron\" and then it is destroyed by going back to \"apeiron\", according to necessity. He believed that infinite worlds are generated from \"apeiron\" and then they are destroyed there again.\n\nHis ideas were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition and by his teacher Thales (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws. The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word \"nomos\" (law) may originally have meant \"natural law\" and used later to mean man-made law.\n\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted \"apeiron\" as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing mythical way of thought to the newer rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek city states during the 6th century BC.\n\nIn the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC) the first primordial god is Chaos, which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between Tartarus and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation). One can name it also abyss (having no bottom).\n\nAlternately, Greek philosopher Thales believed that the origin or first principle was water. Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BC) probably called the water also \"Chaos\" and this is not placed at the very beginning.\n\nIn the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology Enuma Elish describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in Genesis.\nIn the Hindu cosmogony which is similar to the Vedic (Hiranyagarbha) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.\n\nHesiod made an abstraction, because his original \"chaos\" is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in Homer (indefinite sea). A fragment from Xenophanes (6th century BC) shows the transition from \"chaos\" to \"apeiron\": \"The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)\". Either \"apeiron\" meant the \"spatial indefinite\" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration. His ideas may have been influenced by the Pythagoreans:\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making \"apeiron\" the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap between the existing \"mythical\" and the new \"rational\" way of thought (\"rationalism\"). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, water, air, fire, earth, which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod). Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.\n\nThere is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales: \"What is divine? What has no origin, nor end.\" This probably led his student to his final decision for \"apeiron\", because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"arche\" is called \"eternal and ageless\" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).\n\nThe \"apeiron\" has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.\nOut of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars. The first animals were generated in the water. When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish. The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.\n\nIn the commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle's \"Physics\" the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:\n\nThis fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms, meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess \"Justice\" (Dike), appears to keep the order. The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word \"dike\" (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour. The word \"adikia\" (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb \"law and order\" (\"eunomia\"). In Homer's \"Odyssey\" \"eunomia\" is contrasted with \"hubris\" (arrogance). Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a \"city-state\".\n\nAetius (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:\n\nTherefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about \"apeiron\" and this is also noticed by Aristotle:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including Martin Heidegger.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, noted for the creation of quantum mechanics, arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \"primordial substance\". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague Max Born called this substance \"apeiron\".\n\nScholars in other fields, e.g. Bertrand Russell and Maurice Bowra, didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term \"apeiron\", but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.\n\nThere are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. \"Apeiron\" is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant \"nothingless\". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from \"apeiron\" must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.\n\nJustice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.\n\nWe may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with \"apeiron\" is metaphysical (and can lead to monism), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical. The same paradox existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (\"hubris\" or \"adikia\") could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (\"dike\") would destroy him to reestablish the order. These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers. Philolaus (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ( \"apeira\", plural of \"apeiron\") and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (\"apeiron\") and the limited. Something similar is mentioned by Plato: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.\n\nSome doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: \"God ordained that all men shall die\", \"Death is a common debt\". The Greek word \"adikia\" (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits hubris. The relative English word \"arrogance\" (claim as one's own without justification; ), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: \"Nothing in excess.\"\n\nOther pre-Socratic philosophers had different theories of the \"apeiron\". For the Pythagoreans (in particular, Philolaus), the universe had begun as an \"apeiron\", but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts. For Anaxagoras, the initial \"apeiron\" had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike \"Nous\" (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same \"apeiron\", all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.\n\n\n"}

Gundruk is prepared from leafy vegetables but sinki is prepared from radish tap roots. To make this generations-old indigenous dish, aged radish slivers are pressed into a hole lined with bamboo and straw, then coffined by a cover of vegetation, rocks, wood and, finally, mud. After a month of bacterial curing, the resulting preserved vegetable is dried in the sun and stored to last a few years or more.\n\nThe process of making sinki starts by allowing the radishes to wilt for a few days. Then, the leafy tops are cut off and the radish tap-root sections are shredded. A dhiki may be used to break the radish usually if the amount is large. Instead of shredding, the radish is cut if the sinki is to be made into a pickle after fermentation. Meanwhile, a 2- or 3-foot (0.6- or 0.91-m) hole is dug, and a small fire is built at the bottom just before the storage period begins to warm it up.\n\nAfter the hole is sufficiently hot, the fire is extinguished and the bottom is lined with bamboo and straw. On top of this goes the radishes, which then are pressed firmly with more vegetation, boards, rocks and mud to create a fairly impregnable barrier. 20–30 days is needed before the sinki is properly fermented by a series of lactic acids. Then, a final sun drying is needed before they can be eaten.\n\nA common dish that utilizes sinki is a simple soup made by first soaking the fermented radishes in water for about 10 minutes, while chopped vegetables like onion, tomato and chili peppers are sauteed in oil. The strained radish slivers then are fried up with the other vegetables, with just a little salt and turmeric powder. This soup, which is commonly served with white rice, is made by adding water and cooking the vegetables for another 10 minutes until all the ingredients are fully tender.\n\nSinki is also consumed as a pickle. To prepare the pickle, the sinki is not dried. Instead it is directly mixed with spices and bottled.\n\nSinki, just like gundruk or kinema is a popular food among the Nepali people both in India and Nepal. It has inspired folk rhymes and songs like:\n\n\"बाङ्गी बाङ्गी खुट्टिले सिन्कि खाँदौला, थाङ्ना भोटो नदेउ बजै नाङ्गै नाँचऔला ॥\"\n\n\"मंग्लबारे हाटैमा आठानाको सियो, तेरो बाऊ लसुन पुडके सिन्कि बेच्दै थियो ॥\"\n\nGundruk\n\nKinema\n"}

Normington distributed the beverage through Choc-Ola Bottlers Inc., which he founded in 1944 in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nAfter his chain of ice cream parlors was forced to close due to a poor economy, Normington found work at Meadow Gold Dairy (now part of Dean Foods) in Vincennes, Indiana. After moving his family down to Vincennes, he began making plans for a new business in which he planned to bottle and sell a 6-oz chocolate drink, which is what would eventually become Choc-Ola.\n\nBy 1944, Harry had finally found an adequate building in nearby Indianapolis. That same year, after moving his family to Indianapolis and establishing Choc-Ola Bottlers, Inc., Harry purchased a route truck and in conjunction with larger distributors like 7UP, he began having Choc-Ola distributed throughout central Indiana and eventually to all of Indiana and the bordering areas of Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nChoc-Ola continued to gain popularity throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In 1977, at the height of its success, Harry sold the company to Atlanta-based Moxie Industries. Moxie continued to operate the Indianapolis plant and distribute Choc-Ola in much the same way that Harry Normington had; however, periodic problems with cocoa quality and issues with changing FDA regulations caused some challenging production issues.\n\nEventually, unable to meet the new FDA regulations without incurring substantial costs, Moxie opted to close the Indianapolis plant in 1982 and relocate the packaging operation to a contract manufacturer in Doraville, Georgia called Consolidated Chocolate. Packaging of Choc-Ola continued at the Doraville facility until at least 1985. So any cans or bottles that list Doraville, GA as the packaging location were all manufactured in 1982 or after.\n\nEventually, in 1985, Moxie decided to sell the Choc-Ola business to The Chocolate Group (later renamed to Yoo-Hoo Industries), which was also the parent company of Yoo-Hoo; one of Choc-Ola's major competitors at the time. Shortly thereafter, The Chocolate Group began phasing out production and distribution of Choc-Ola. It is not known precisely when production completely ceased; however, it is believed to have been largely shutdown by the late 1980s.\n\nIn 2003, Yoo-Hoo Industries sells several beverage brands to the Mott's division of Cadbury-Schweppes. Choc-Ola was one of the brands acquired by Mott's during that acquisition. The trademark for Choc-Ola expired in June 2009 and Mott's did not renew it - stating in an \"Indianapolis Star\" article on 29 November 2011 that they had no intention of doing anything else with Choc-Ola.\n\nIn early 2010, the owner of the Rock-Cola '50s Cafe, Dan Iaria, in Indianapolis secured the trademark and began selling Choc-Ola out of his 1950s-style cafe.\n\nOn March 21, 2011 it was announced that an agreement was made with Prairie Farms to produce and distribute Choc-Ola through South Bend, Indiana-based Martin's Super Markets, a regional 21-store chain.\n\nIn late November 2011, a deal was struck with Prairie Farms Dairy to manufacture Choc-Ola at their Anderson, Indiana facility. By early December 2011 major retail outlets like Walmart, K-mart, Safeway, IGA began selling Choc-Ola along with a number of smaller, central-Indiana regional retail outlets.\n\nPrairie Farms says they plan to eventually distribute Choc-Ola in 18 states in individual-sized bottles and half-gallon jugs, primarily at grocery stores and convenience stores.\n\nIn May 2012, a deal was struck with Dairy Farmers of America-based out of Springfield, MO to co-pack Choc-Ola in 12 oz shelf-stable cans to avoid the shelf-life limitations and refrigerated storage requirements imposed by the half-gallons (22-day shelf-life) being manufactured by Prairie Farms. At the same time, Choc-Ola discontinued its non-shelf-stable manufacturing partnership with Prairie Farms.\n\nIn November 2013, Choc-Ola became available for online purchases on their company website.\n\nIn September 2014, Choc-Ola changed packaging from 24-pks translucent shrink-wrapped cases, to full color market wrapped 12-pks. The size change was to facilitate a lower weight point-of-sale product and also lower weight item to ship. The change to the shrink-wrap was to create a more attractive and marketable package.\n\nAt the same time that the packaging was being changed for a better retail fit for smaller retail outlets, Choc-Ola Corp. partnered up with Walgreens to offer Choc-Ola in the Central Indiana region. Future expansion plans were discussed that would target southern Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio if the initial rollout was successful.\n\nIn the 1970s, as Choc-Ola was gaining a loyal following, it was helped along by advertising spots on local Indiana independent television station, WTTV 4. Choc-Ola's target market at the time was children and young adults, so kid's programs like Cowboy Bob's Corral (aka Cowboy Bob's Chuckwagon Theater) and \"Nightmare Theater\", hosted by Sammy Terry, were regularly utilized as strategic advertising mediums.\n\nIn 1978, Pete Rose, one of the most renowned sports figure of his era, contacted Choc-Ola in an attempt to partner with them. He liked chocolate beverages and Choc-Ola was one of his favorites. Rose and Choc-Ola launched a separate chocolate beverage, officially endorsed by Rose, called \"Pete\", assuming that his enormous popularity at the time would make a Rose-endorsed beverage an instant success. However, per Rose's contract, he was prohibited from making any unauthorized advertising reference to the Cincinnati Reds, including being shown in his Reds ball cap. This hampered the success of the Pete beverage, and the short-lived drink was shelved almost as quickly as it was conceived.\nAt some point, the Indianapolis plant acquired a mascot of sorts; a giant white and black spotted cow that was raised on a white pole at the south end of the main parking lot.\n\n\n"}

Recipes for harissa vary according to the household and region. Variations can include the addition of cumin, red peppers, garlic, coriander, and lemon juice. Ingredients can be fermented onions, garlic, peppers, or tomato paste. In Saharan regions, harissa can have a smoky flavor. Prepared harissa is also sold in jars, cans, bottles, tubes, plastic bags, and other containers.\n\nHarissa is sometimes described as \"Tunisia's main condiment\", even \"the national condiment of Tunisia\", or at least as \"the hallmark of Tunisia's fish and meat dishes\". In Tunisia, harissa is used as an ingredient in a meat (poultry, beef, goat, or lamb) or fish stew with vegetables, and as a flavoring for couscous. It is also used for \"lablabi\", a chickpea soup usually eaten for breakfast. In Algeria, harissa is commonly added to soups, stews, and couscous. Harissa paste can also be used as a rub for meat or eggplants. In Israel, harissa is a common topping for \"sabich\" and \"shawarma\", although other hot sauces such as the Yemeni \"sahawiq\" or the Iraqi \"amba\" are also used. Moroccan cuisine has also adopted harissa, using it as a side condiment for tagines, or sometimes mixed into dishes.\n\nTunisia is the biggest exporter of prepared harissa. In 2006, the Tunisian production of harissa was 22,000 tonnes, incorporating about 40,000 tonnes of peppers. Tunisian harissa is often made with chilis grown around Nabeul and Gabès, which are relatively mild, scoring 40,000–50,000 on the Scoville scale. Another significant producer is Algeria's Annaba Province, which is also a significant consumer. According to cookbook author Martha Rose Shulman, premade harissa tastes rather different from that which is served in Tunisian and expatriate restaurants.\n\n\n"}

The railways brought the best of Victorian Kitchens and recreated lavish menus for their lodges. Meanwhile, mountain guides from Switzerland, Austria and Germany were learning from the native people how to cook and appreciate local foods. Learning the art of curing and smoking game and fish helped people survive the long mountain winters.\n\nGame meats fit nicely into the popular lighter culinary style of today. As naturally lean meats, they are ideally suited for cooking quickly over the high heat of a grill or wok, stir-fried or roasted and served with a light sauce, salad and vegetables. Current traditions is known largely as a farm-to-table concept throughout the region.\n\nAlberta beef is a staple for the northern region with worldwide recognition for its quality and tenderness. It is prepared in a variety of ways from barbecuing, braising, grilling, skewering, etc. and most notably served as steaks. Bison, elk, caribou, wild boar, venison and pheasant are other local feature that can also be prepared in a variety of ways. The province grows a lot of local grains used in a variety of different foods and drinks. Alberta is also the fifth largest honey producing region in the world, producing 18 million pounds of honey annually. During the fall, the cold nights also cause root vegetables to concentrate causing them to taste sweeter. \n\nAlberta is also known for its growing craft-beer and alcohol industry with microbreweries located in both urban and rural areas around the province. A variety of micro breweries, distilleries, meaderies, and fruit wineries can be found throughout the province. The city of Calgary is also the birthplace of the Caesar, a cocktail consisting of vodka mixed with clam-infused tomato juice, lime, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce, with a delicious celery salt rim Michael Chell created the cocktail to celebrate the 1969 opening of the Calgary Inn’s new restaurant, Marco’s Italian. Inspired by his favourite Italian dish, spaghetti vongole, Chell set out to create a cocktail that would capture the pasta’s hearty clam and tomato flavours. The drink is popular across Canada but can be compared to the more widely known Bloody Mary cocktail.\n\nLocal meats and produce can be found throughout the numerous farmers markets located in these major cities, with some being open year-round. Festivals happen throughout the province to promote local food and drink with the most notable events being the Taste of Edmonton festival and the Calgary Stampede. \n\n"}

Yukimarimo were discovered in 1995 at Dome F by the 36th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE-36) at temperatures of –59 to –72 °C. Electrostatic attraction between ice crystals explains the formation of yukimarimo at these low temperatures.\n\nYukimarimo were named by T. Kameda on JARE-36 in 1995. \"Yuki\" means snow in Japanese, and \"marimo\" is a ball-like growth of water algae which the yukimarimo resemble.\n\nDuring a storm on the Antarctic plateau, humidity rises above normal levels. After a storm, the temperature drops rapidly and, due to the excess humidity, hoarfrost forms on the surface of the snow. At these low temperatures, electrostatic attraction between the rapidly formed ice crystals is high, due to growth charging during formation. When a light wind blows after the formation of this hoarfrost, the hoarfrost breaks apart and the frost crystals clump together and stick due to the high electrostatic attraction and subsequent fusing of the ice crystals. They then tumble across the snow in a manner similar to tumbleweed. The sizes of the yukimarimo range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter.\n\nTo celebrate the discovery of the yukimarimo, a line of cookies were manufactured in Japan.

It was said to be an elixir of such power that the fumes alone have been known to melt the rivets off battleships.\n\nCapp asserted in 1965 that the cartoon \"never has suggested that the drink is moonshine\", in response to claims that the Kickapoo Joy Juice of \"Li'l Abner\" was an illicitly distilled liquor. \nBrewed by Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat, two of the comic strip's backwood poachers, the ingredients of the brew are both mysterious and all-encompassing, (much like the contents of their cave, which has been known to harbor prehistoric monsters.)

Capp, however, would have the last word on all advertising and promotion. Kickapoo Joy Juice's early advertising campaign was very similar to Mountain Dew's of the time – using characters from \"Li'l Abner\" to create and market a hillbilly feeling.

It is distilled in Frankfort, Kentucky at the Buffalo Trace Distillery.\n\nThe Blanton's brand was launched in 1984 under the guidance of the distillery's master distiller Elmer T. Lee, as the first modern bourbon brand marketed as a single barrel bourbon. The original brand name was \"Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon\". A single barrel bourbon is one for which each bottling batch is produced from the contents of only one particular aging barrel – not mixed with whiskey from any other barrels (and not blended with neutral spirits, colorings, or flavorings). The company says that producing a high quality whiskey using this production method requires constant monitoring of every barrel in the middle of the warehouse by the Master Distiller. The barrels are dumped by hand without using machinery. There are eight different stopper designs, each with a different letter of the alphabet molded into it and topped with a figurine of a racehorse and jockey. When placed in order, spelling \"B L A N T O N' S\", the horse and jockey's poses display eight different scenes of a horse race, from standing at the gate, to crossing the finish line with a win.\n\nBlanton's Single Barrel Bourbon is typically aged for 6 to 8 years. It is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-cladded warehouse at Buffalo Trace and was commissioned for construction by one of the distillery's early leaders, Albert B. Blanton, shortly after the end of the Prohibition era. Being metal, the warehouse transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, which allows for more rapid aging.\n\nThere are multiple different expressions of Blanton's, each being a different proof. However, only the 93 proof expression is available in the United States with the others being exported.\n\nBlanton's bourbon was named in honor of one of the distillery's early leaders, Albert B. Blanton, who the company claims spent most of his life preserving the tradition of handcrafted bourbon. Blanton worked at the facility now known as the Buffalo Trace Distillery for approximately 55 years. He was born and raised on a farm just outside Frankfort, Kentucky, and he began working at the distillery (then called the O.F.C. Distillery) in 1897 as an office boy when he was 16 years old. Over the next few years he reportedly worked in every department, and in 1912 he was appointed superintendent of the distillery, its warehouse, and bottling shop – at the same time that the distillery was renamed to become the George T. Stagg Distillery. He became president of the whiskey plant in 1921. Blanton died in 1959.\n\nThe company refers to him as \"Colonel Blanton\", as he held the honorific title of Kentucky Colonel (a relatively common honorific bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky). The distillery had several owners during its history, and was renamed by its current owner, the Sazerac Company, to become the Buffalo Trace Distillery in 2001.\n\nElmer T. Lee, the originator of Blanton's, was hired by the distillery by Blanton in 1949. He introduced the Blanton's brand in 1984, a year before he retired, as the first modern brand of bourbon marketed as single barrel bourbon. Lee continued to act as an ambassador for Buffalo Trace until his death in 2013.\n"}

Since that year, however, incarceration rates have grown exponentially, creating the need for physicians in correctional institutions. Prison medicine began, in its most rudimentary form, in Victorian England, under the health reforms promoted by wealthy philanthropist and devout ascetic John Howard and his collaborator, well-to-do Quaker physician John Fothergill.\n\nAnother early development in the history of prison healthcare was the work of Louis-René Villermé (1782–1863), a physician and pioneering hygienist whose study, \"Des Prisons\", was published in 1820. The work of Villerme and other French hygienists was an inspiration to German, American, and British public health leaders and spurred an overhaul in the conditions in which prisoners were held.\n\nHealth care in prisons has been commissioned by NHS England since 2013. Before that it was locally commissioned by Primary Care Trusts. Guidelines produced in 2016 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that on admission there should be a health check with confidential testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. In 2016 there were more than 4,400 prisoners aged 60 or over in England and Wales, and the number was increasingly rapidly. “They are sicker and more likely to have complex health needs than people of an equivalent age who are living in the community”.\n\nCare UK provides healthcare for people in about 30 prisons.\n\nThe House of Commons Health Select Committee produced a report on prison healthcare in November 2018. They found that difficulties in getting prescribed medication had led to prisoners being hospitalised. They had to make an appointment for medication which outside prison was freely available and they could only get one day's supply at a time. Possession of medication could lead to bullying.\n\nIn the 1970s, widespread intervention by federal courts improved conditions of confinement, including health care services and public health conditions, and it stimulated investment in medical staff, equipment, and facilities necessary to improve quality and organization of prison and jail medical services. Prison is often the first place that people in the USA are able to receive medical treatment which they couldn't afford outside.\n\nThe Society of Correctional Physicians is a non-profit physician organization founded in August, 1992 as national educational and scientific society for the advancement of correctional medicine, and became the American College of Correctional Physicians in 2015.\n\nMental health services in prison aren't available in providing treatments for criminals; most prisoners have an untreated mental disorder and psychiatric care or treatment is expensive for the mentally ill. 64 percent of jail inmates, 54 percent of state prisoners, and 45 percent of federal prisoners in the US report having mental health concerns.\n\n\n\n"}

Nettle soup is eaten mainly during spring and early summer, when young nettle buds are collected. Today, nettle soup is mostly eaten in Scandinavia, Iran, Ireland, and Eastern Europe, with regional differences in recipe, however historically consumption of nettles was more widespread. Nettle stew was eaten by inhabitants of Britain in the Bronze Age, 3000 years ago.\n\nThe consumption of young stinging nettle in medieval Europe was used medicinally, primarily as a diuretic and to treat joint pain and arthritis, hay fever and as a blood purifier. Various Native American tribes have used stinging nettles for centuries, including the Lakota using the root for stomach pain, the Ojibwa using the stewed leaves for skin issues and used it to fight dysentery, the Potawatomi using the roots for fever reduction, and the Winnebago used nettles for allergy symptoms. \n\nStinging nettles known to have a high nutritional value, including calcium, magnesium, iron, and vitamins A and B. Historically, one of the easy ways of consuming nettles is either through a soup or a tea because the boiling water deactivates the nettle from stinging.\n\nThere are regional and cultural differences for recipes for Nettle soup.\n\nA typical Swedish recipe for nettle soup (nässelsoppa) involves first blanching the nettles, and then straining them from the liquid. The liquid is then strained again to remove the dirt (pieces of sand or gravel) from it. Then a roux is made, with butter and flour, onto which the \"nettle water\" (the water in which the nettles were blanched) is poured. The nettles are chopped very finely, or puréed, together with the other ingredients, which typically include chives (or ramson or garlic), and chervil or fennel. The chopped or puréed nettles and herbs are then put into the nettle water, brought to a boil, and then left to simmer for a few minutes. Some recipes call for discarding the nettle water and replacing it with chicken stock or lamb stock, but according to others this way of making the soup takes away the natural taste of the nettles. The soup is commonly served with sliced boiled eggs or crème fraîche, and occasionally with poached eggs.\n\nA Native American stinging nettle and squash soup recipe, provided by the Northwest Indian College, consists of stinging nettles, acorn squash, broth, garlic, onion and oil. The squash is cut, de-seeded and roasted. In a separate pot, the onions and garlic are sautéed until translucent, and then the squash and nettles (which can be cooked or fresh nettles) are added. Together they all cook in the pot for 20 minutes, then finished in a blender.\n\n\"See also:\" Mazanderani cuisine\n\nThere is a nettle soup recipe from the Mazandaran province of Iran. There are variations on the ingredients for this soup recipe, however all of the recipes include stinging nettles, garlic, onion, chickpeas, turmeric, rice, lentils, greens, oil and either pomegranate paste or pomegranate molasses. Optional ingredients can include other types of beans (pinto beans, fava beans), beets, butternut squash, other types of greens (local northern Iranian herbs zolang and anarijeh, spinach, Persian leek, cilantro), The water that the nettles are cooked in (for preparation of the soup) is saved and used as a drinking tea, for medicinal purposes.\n\n"}

The primary brand expression is an 80 U.S. proof (40% alcohol by volume) bourbon aged \"at least 36 months\" according to its label.\n\nThree whiskey-based liqueurs of 70 U.S. proof (35% alcohol by volume) also carry the brand name – one with apple flavoring, one with peach flavoring and the third with brown sugar flavoring.\n\nThe Benchmark brand was created by Seagram's in the late 1960s to be a luxury or premium-level bourbon. At that time, the whiskey was not called McAfee's, but simply Benchmark Bourbon; and the name McAfee came much later. Originally Benchmark was sold in a decanter-style bottle with a black label.\n\nThe Benchmark brand name was purchased by the Sazerac Company in 1989 from Seagram's. It is still owned by Sazerac Brands of New Orleans which also now owns the Buffalo Trace distillery in Frankfort, where Benchmark is now made. The origin of the McAfee name is that Hancock McAfee was, in 1775, one of the first European settlers at the site where Buffalo Trace stands today. The original Benchmark was made at Lawrenceburg, Kentucky at the Four Roses Distillery when Seagram owned it.\n"}

Stratum corneum, as the outermost layer of skin, is responsible for the various barrier function of skin and protects our body from external harmful things.\n\nStratum corneum lipids are elaborately organized into lamellar structure, which plays the most important role for skin's barrier functions. Unlike the conventional moisturizers made with humectants or emollients, MLE can restore and improve the barrier function of skin, with its distinctive structural similarity to the native human skin's lamellar structure. Restoring the skin barrier function can improve skin hydration and protect skin from external irritants.\n\nThe efficacy of MLE on skin barrier was proven by several clinical studies performed in independent University Hospitals and reported in peer-reviewed academic journals, including Journal of Investigative Dermatology, one of the most renowned journals in the field of dermatology. Along with its therapeutic benefits, MLE also shows non-sticky textures, allowing quick absorption after application.\n\nAs an O/W emulsion, MLE can be also used as a vehicle (carrier) for topical drugs.

The common noun is derived from the domain name of the popular erotic comics website Kirtu.com, although as a proprietary eponym it is often used to refer to Indian cartoon pornography in general, much like hentai is used to denote sexually explicit or pornographic comics and animation from Japan, particularly anime, manga, and computer games.\n\nPornography is illegal in India, and although it is available virtually anywhere, especially in areas where pirated material is already being sold, it is generally of the softcore variety and typically of low quality.\n\nHardcore pornography involving actors and models, both on film and in photographs, is much more difficult to come by, and almost impossible to produce and distribute domestically because of the ban. Therefore, illustrated and animated pornography is an increasingly popular alternative in India to hardcore content performed by people. Although various websites and print outlets besides kirtu.com exist, animated pornography in general is often referred to simply as \"kirtu\".\n\nIndia played a significant role in the history of human sexuality, from writing the first literature that treated sexual intercourse as a science, to modern times, where the origin of the philosophical focus of new-age groups' attitudes on sex came from. It may be argued that India pioneered the use of sexual education through art and literature, and it is the birthplace of the Kama Sutra, an ancient Indian Hindu text widely considered to be the standard work on human sexual behavior.\n\nIn modern India, however, there is a great taboo on sex due to a variety of reasons, many of which involve cultural values which were native to India.\n\nIn Indian film and television, there is currently a decrease in the taboo related to the depiction of sexuality. However, many Bollywood films, with an emphasis on the rich and urban class, rarely depict the true values that most Indians have about sex. Since a legitimate pornography industry has yet to emerge within India, many low-quality, foreign-made films featuring Indians are made abroad and then imported, leaving open the possibility of sexual exploitation.\n\nIllustrated graphic pornography, however, removes the possibility of sexual exploitation while addressing the same explicit subject matter. \n\nThe term \"kirtu\" originates in the Kama Sutra. Modern translations of the ancient text are all based on original writings attributed to Vātsyāyana, a Hindu philosopher in the Vedic tradition who is believed to have lived during time of the Gupta Empire (4th to 6th centuries CE). The Kama Sutra was composed from many sources, not all of which were used in the Vatsyayana version. Deshmukh, the pseudonymous creator of Kirtu.com, claims to have chosen as its name the anglicization of the Sanskrit term for an untranslated and forbidden sex position in the uncompiled Kama Sutra texts that involves the penetration of all of a woman's orifices, much like the mythical Venus Butterfly position in the West. This position is known as the \"kirtu\".\n\n\"Savita Bhabhi - The Sexual Adventures of a Hot Indian Bhabhi\" is the most popular kirtu comic in India It is an erotic webcomic about the adventures of a bored and emotionally neglected housewife. Initially, the cartoon strip was free to view, but, after the government threatened to prosecute the strip's creators and the owners of its website, the strip moved to kirtu.com and required a subscription fee to view.\n\nIn addition to Savita Bhabhi, the site has developed many other ongoing and limited-edition series specifically aimed at Indian culture, each of which caters to a certain demographic of the population. The site and its contents have become a cause célèbre for cultural freedom among many of India's liberal thinkers and social scientists.\n"}

Dry water actually consists of 95% liquid water, but the silica coating prevents the water droplets from combining and turning back into a bulk liquid. The result is a white powder that looks very similar to table salt. It is also more commonly known among researchers as \"empty water\".\n\nDry water was first patented in 1968 and was immediately snatched up by cosmetic companies as it appeared to have potential applications in the cosmetics field. It was rediscovered in 2006 by the University of Hull, UK, and has since been evaluated and studied for its potential use in other fields. The dry water itself is easy enough to manufacture. The hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and water are blended together using a motor with a stirring rod and impeller that spins at 19,000 rpm for 90 seconds, which coats the water droplets completely.\n\nCertain gases, when mixed with dry water, combine with the water, which then traps them in a solid clathrate hydrate cage. This presents the possibility that explosive gases could be easily transported with a reduced risk of accidental detonation. Dry water is currently being considered for use as a carbon sequestration agent to capture and seal away greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Scientists consider that dry water will prove useful in the future to help fight global warming as it was found that it could store as much as three times more carbon dioxide than ordinary water over a similar length of time. Dry water also has applications for the transportation and storage of dangerous materials. It can be used as a medium for volatile compounds, as materials stored within the dry water can be reduced to powder and stabilized – reducing not only the volatility of the substance, but also its weight for transport. It has also been theorized that dry water could have potential uses in the construction of fuel cells for automobiles due to its ability to store and stabilize very large amounts of volatile gases and materials without permanently binding them. Due to its nature, dry water is classified as an adsorbent material. It has many potential uses in fields where emulsions are required or used. Recent studies have also found dry water to help jumpstart reactions or to work as a catalyst.\n\n"}

It was introduced by the Portuguese-Jewish plantation owners as the Portuguese potato (\"\"pomme de terre\"\") oven dish. Because the potato did not grow in Suriname and had to be imported it was soon replaced with the root of the tayer plant. \"Pom\" combines three central ingredients: chicken, citrus juice and \"pomtajer\" (\"Xanthosoma sagittifolium\"). Only the latter is indigenous, and although all plant parts are edible, only the underground part of the main stem is used as an ingredient in preparing \"pom\". The main stem or corm is most frequently designated as \"pomtajer\" or \"pongtaya\" (lit. the tajer/taya for \"pom\").\n\nThe first published description of \"pom\" comes from the \"Encyclopedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië\" (1914–1917) which describes the dish as follows: ‘the big tajer, of which the stalk grows above the earth, is grated and treated with the juice of bitter oranges, afterwards with chicken or fish, made into a pie, which dish is known as \"pom\".’\n\nThe basic preparation method is sautéed chicken pieces between two layers of raw, grated \"pomtajer\", mixed with citrus juice and a sauce made from oil and/or margarine, onions, tomatoes, salt, pepper and nutmeg, baked in an oven until the \"pom\" becomes golden brown.\n\nIn Amsterdam alone there are over 120 establishments serving Surinamese food. Other Dutch cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague have a growing number of caterers, eateries and take-aways. Most establishments serve \"pom\", and often also “\"broodje pom\"” (\"pom\" on a bread roll), a derivation of the national dish. In particular, “\"broodje pom\"” is rapidly gaining popularity and starting to appear on the Dutch menu. It can sometimes even be ordered in Dutch take-aways and for home-delivery. In recent years, more and more recipes for \"pom\" have appeared in Dutch cookbooks, newspapers and on websites.

The American Scott Paper Company developed mass-produced paper fashion in 1966 as a marketing stunt. Customers could send a coupon and $1.25 to receive a dress made of \"Dura-Weve\", a cellulose material patented in 1958.\n\nThese \"Paper Caper\" dresses, which featured a red bandanna print or a black and white op art pattern, kicked off a fashion craze. 500,000 of them were produced, and other manufacturers soon followed suit. By 1967, paper dresses sold in major department stores for about $8 ($61 in 2018) apiece, and entire paper clothing boutiques were set up by companies such as Abraham & Straus and I. Magnin. At the height of demand, Mars Hosiery made 100,000 dresses a week. Other items made of paper included underwear, men's vests, bridal gowns (expensive at $15, or $114 in 2018), children's pinafores (\"just the thing for ever-sprouting sprouts\") and even rain coats and bikinis (\"good for two to three wearings\"). Among the novel materials used for such clothes were \"Kaycel\" by Kimberly-Stevens (93% cellulose and 7% nylon, \"fire resistant unless washed\"), \"Ree-may\" by Du Pont (a \"spunbonded\" polyester) and \"Webril\" by Kendall (a nonwoven rayon).\n\nThe paper dress captured the vibrant, youthful, optimistic and consumerist \"zeitgeist\" of 1960s America so precisely the fashion press speculated about paper garments taking over the entire clothes market. The dresses were whimsical, often featured eye-catching pop art-like patterns, shapes for the customer to color, or advertisements (such as the \"Souper Dress\" featuring Andy Warhol's \"Campbell's Soup Cans\"). They were just one of many newly disposable items – like cutlery, plates, pens, lighters, and razors – consumers were embracing; the \"Paper Caper\" sales pitch ran: \"Won't last forever…who cares? Wear it for kicks—then give it the air.\" \n\nAs the novelty appeal of paper clothes wore off, their downsides became more apparent: they were generally ill-fitting and uncomfortable, their garish colors could rub off, they were often flammable, and eventually ended as waste. By 1968, paper clothing had disappeared from the market.\n\nWhile no longer encountered in mass-market fashion, the same cellulose fabrics are still employed to make disposable garments for work environments, such as hospital gowns, scrubs, and coveralls. The paper dresses of the 1960s also still inspire contemporary fashion designers, including Yeohlee and Vivienne Tam, who have on occasion incorporated paper into their designs.\n\n\n"}

The most common types of rempeyek are \"peyek kacang\" (\"peanut peyek\"); however, other ingredients might be used also, such as \"teri\" (dried anchovies), \"rebon\" (small shrimp) or \"ebi\" (dried shrimp). Today rempeyek is commonly found in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as countries with considerable Indonesian migrant populations such as The Netherlands and Surinam .\n\nCoconut milk, salt, and spices such as ground candlenut and coriander are often mixed within the flour batter. Some recipes might also add a chopped citrus leaf to add a fresh aroma and taste to it. The spiced batter, mixed or sprinkled with the granule ingredients, is deep fried in ample hot coconut oil. The flour batter acts as a binding agent for the granules (peanuts, anchovy, shrimp, etc.). This hardens upon frying and turns into a golden brown and crispy cracker.\n\nIn Indonesia, rempeyek making is traditionally a small scale home industry, yet today some rempeyek producers have reached a larger production scale and distribute widely with a rempeyek-brand trading value reaching 25 million Rupiah (around US$2,100) monthly. In Malaysia, rempeyek now is widely made using machines.\n\nThe snack can be also found in the South American country of Suriname due to the influence of Javanese migrants there.\n\n\"Rempeyek\" is derived from the Javanese term \"peyek\" as the sounds of a breaking cracker, to denote its crispiness. In Indonesia rempeyek is often associated with Javanese cuisine, served to accompany pecel (vegetables in peanut sauce) or to accompany any meal, or be served as snack. Today it is commonly known throughout Indonesia, and is popular in Malaysia following the migration of Javanese to the British Malaya in the early 19th century.\n\nThe most common and widely distributed type of rempeyek is \"rempeyek kacang\" (peanuts granules rempeyek); however, anchovies, small shrimp, dried shrimp, and beans such as mung beans and soybeans are commonly found. In Java rempeyek kacang is common in Banyumas region of Central Java, while rempeyek \"rebon\" (small shrimp) is commonly associated with the port town of Cirebon. Rempeyek made with larger shrimp is commonly found in Padang restaurants.\n\nRempeyek can also be made with spinach, which is known as peyek bayam.

It is also common to brush the cakes with a simple syrup to make it more moist. Often the cake layers are filled with either a white frosting or coconut pastry cream. Traditionally, the cake is frosted with a 7-minute frosting, but cream cheese icings and buttercreams are not uncommon. Like the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a must in the frosting. One constant characteristic of coconut cake is the use of shredded coconut (often toasted and/or sweetened) to cover the frosting.\n\nOne popular variation of coconut cake is coconut poke cake. While traditional coconut cake is round and multi-layered, coconut poke cake is either a white or yellow cake that is rectangular and single-layered. What makes it a \"poke\" cake are the holes made into the cake to act as pores to absorb a coconut liquid mixture or cream of coconut, such as CoCo Lopez.

It is one of the most popular foods in Indonesia. Sundanese food is characterised by its freshness; the famous lalab eaten with sambal and also karedok demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Unlike the rich and spicy taste, infused with coconut milk and curry of Minangkabau cuisine, the Sundanese cuisine displays the simple and clear taste; ranged from savoury salty, fresh sourness, mild sweetness, to hot and spicy.\n\nSambal terasi is the most important and the most common condiment in Sundanese cuisine, and eaten together with lalab or fried tofu and tempeh. Sayur Asem vegetable tamarind soup is probably the most popular vegetable soup dish in Sundanese cuisine. Another popular soup is Soto Bandung, a soup of beef and daikon radish, and mie kocok noodle soup with beef meat and \"kikil\".\n\nFresh water fishes such as carp, gourami, tilapia and catfish are usually either being \"bakar\" (grilled) or \"goreng\" (deep fried) and usually served with sambal or sweet soy sauce. Sundanese people has developed fondness for salted seafoods. Various fried salted fishes, anchovy, and salted cuttlefish is popular in Sundanese daily diet. The \"pais\" or pepes cooking method that employs banana leaf as the wrapper of food is also common in Sundanese cuisine. Among other, \"pais lauk emas\" or carp fish pepes is among the favourite pepes dishes.\n\nChicken are usually either fried or grilled, also served with sambal or sweet soy sauce. \"Bakakak hayam\" is Sundanese style ayam bakar (grilled chicken). Sometimes chicken also can be made as pepes or soup. Meats such as beef, water buffalo, lamb, or goat can be marinated with the mixture of spices and coconut sugar and fried to make the \"empal gepuk\" sweet fried meat, sprinkled with fried shallots. Beef and potato sometimes are stewed in sweet soy sauce and spices as \"semur daging\". Cow liver and jengkol stinky bean also can be made as \"semur\" as well. Goat and lamb meat also can be made as satay in Sundanese style, such as \"sate maranggi\". \"Gulai kambing\" and \"empal gentong\" goat meat and offal curry is also popular soup.\n\nIf Javanese has developed their fondness for tempeh, Sundanese has developed the fondness for oncom instead, both are fermented products but with different kind of fungi and beans; tempeh is from soy beans while oncom is from peanuts. Sundanese has developed the fermentation method to create distinct foodstuffs. Fermentation was employed either for making fermented food such as oncom, making sauce such as tauco (adopted from Chinese Indonesian cuisine), or sweet snack foods such as peuyeum which are tapai made from rice or cassava.\n\nIn Sundanese cuisine establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands.

The dishes may be served on a short legged table or altogether served on the mat. This dine style is quite similar with Japanese traditional tatami dine style. The Sundanese traditional restaurant in rural village may also feature a \"saung\" style restaurant. It features several small eating pavilions that might be built near or over fresh water fish ponds. The fish ponds contains alive fresh water fishes such as carp and gourami, that might be selected and ordered by customers to be freshly cooked immediately.\n\nIn popular Indonesian culture, Sundanese restaurant often can be easily distinguished by containing the name \"\"Kuring\"\", thus led to the terms \"Kuring\"-food or \"Kuring\"-restaurant. However this naming was rather misleading, since in Sundanese language the word \"Kuring\" is a common, colloquial, yet rather coarse form to refer first-person singular personal pronoun (\"I\" or \"me\"), also as possessive adjective (\"my\"). This naming trend was led by restaurants that tried to imitate the famous Sundanese restaurant \"Lembur Kuring\" (Sundanese: \"My Home Village\"). Some examples of famous Sundanese restaurants are Ampera, Boboko, Bumbu Desa, Ciganea, Dapur Sunda, Laksana, Lembur Kuring, Mang Engking, Mang Kabayan, Ma' Uneh, Ponyo, Sari Kuring, Saung Kuring, Sindang Reret and Talaga Sampireun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to Shoaib Daniyal, writing in \"The Sunday Guardian\", the first written recipe of Harees dates back to the 10th century, when Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar compiled a cookbook of dishes popular with the \"kings and caliphs and lords and leaders\" of Baghdad. \"The version described in his Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes), the world’s oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, is strikingly similar to the one people in the Middle East eat to this day\" it reported. Harees was introduced by Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam's army to the city.\n\nAs per the Delhi based historian Sohail Hashmi, the \"Khichra\" originated as a famine relief measure in the North Indian city of Lucknow while building the Old Imambara of Lucknow. Due to a famine, the then Nawab of Awadh commenced the construction of an Imambargah, announcing that anyone who participated in the construction would be given free food. This free food consisted of rice slowly cooked with mutton and various pulses, thus becoming rich in protein and carbohydrates. This aided a number of famine affected people who would otherwise have died. Once the construction of the Imambargah was completed, the dish continued to get popular and can today be found not just in Lucknow, but a number of cities of the Indian subcontinent. Travellers took this dish to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it further acquired a local flavor.\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent, both Haleem and Khichra are made with same ingredients. Haleem is cooked until the meat blends with the lentils, while in Khichra chunks of meat remains as cubes.\n\nKhichra is similar to Haleem and is a meat dish.

The whole process must take no more than 25 minutes, in order to keep the candy mass warm and malleable.\n\nCandy canes were first introduced by French confectioners at Basel fairs in the 1860s, and sold in the form of thick candy lumps since about 1879. The confectioner Leonz Goldinger invented the current Mässmogge, with a hazelnut filling, at around 1900. At that time, the candies were produced directly at the fair and sold while still warm.\n\nUp until the 1960s, several confectioners produced Mässmogge for the Basel fairs. Because of the expense of producing the candy, the number of manufacturers has since dwindled to one, \"Sweet Basel AG\".\n\n\n"}

The 100% blue agave tequila is bottled in Jalisco, Mexico. 1800 is named after the year tequila was first aged in oak casks, and is sold throughout the world. In the United States, the brand is imported and distributed by the Beckmann family's US distribution company, Proximo Spirits.\n\nThe first officially licensed tequila manufacturer was Jose Antonio Cuervo of Jalisco, Mexico, in 1758, after he was given the rights by King Ferdinand VI of Spain to cultivate a portion of land. Shortly thereafter, the production of tequila was banned, until 1795, when King Carlos IV lifted the ban. 1800 is widely known as the year in which tequila was first successfully aged in wood.\n\nOriginally known as Cuervo 1800 Tequila, 1800 Tequila was launched in 1975 as a premium sipping tequila. The Silver, Añejo and Reposado labels were introduced in 2004. Since 2008, it has been distributed in the US by Proximo Spirits. That year, the Select Silver label was introduced, as the first and only 100 proof clear tequila. In 2006, 1800 introduced The Ultimate Margarita, 19.9 proof and the only pre-mixed, ready-to-serve margarita mix made with 100% blue agave tequila (1800 Silver).\n\nAt the 2008 San Francisco Wine and Spirits Competition, the Silver, Reposado and Añejo tequilas each won the silver medal, while the Milenio and Select Silver both received the bronze medal. In 2009, \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" named 1800 Select Silver one of the world's 20 best-tasting tequilas. \"Wine Enthusiast\" placed the 1800 Coleccion, an extra añejo, in its \"96-100\" scoring category. It was described by \"The New York Times\" as \"sweetly vegetal and very rich with an elegant aftertaste.\"\n\n1800's bottles have a trapezoidal shape and a top designed to serve as a shot glass, by loosening the top slightly, turning the bottle upside down, and filling up the top.\n\nIn 2008, 1800 Tequila released a special limited-edition Essential Artist Series, with 12 unique bottle designs. A second series was released in 2009 with one \"celebrity artist\" bottle created by Shepard Fairey's firm Studio Number One, plus 11 new designs picked from 15,000 online submissions from across the United States, including a $10,000 grand prize winner. Other series bottle designers include artists Gary Baseman, Yuko Shimizu and Tara McPherson. As of 2013, 1800 is on its fifth annual Essential Artists series. Each year, 1,800 of each Essential Artists bottle are produced.\n\nIn October 2013, 1800 launched a new international advertising campaign featuring actor Ray Liotta in four commercials, directed by Anthony Mandler. Each of the moody spots are free of dialogue (with the exception of several where Liotta orders the tequila, with the only piece of dialogue being \"1800\"), were filmed in Buenos Aires and show Liotta traveling to get to a glass of 1800 Tequila. A previous 1800 campaign from 2011 featured actor Michael Imperioli in eight different commercials with a straightforward approach coveting the values of an older generation; and in 2009, rapper Rick Ross and his crew, the Triple C's, became brand ambassadors by publicly endorsing Select Silver.\n\n1800 Silver has two sponsorships with two NBA teams, signing marketing agreements with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 (becoming the first spirits brand to sponsor the Lakers), and with the New York Knicks the following year. The agreements with both teams include ad placement at their respective stadiums, the Staples Center and Madison Square Garden, on the teams' websites, and various promotional activities throughout the NBA season.\n\n"}

According to Bujinkan sources he became well-known throughout China and Japan for his martial arts prowess and his knowledge from studying \"ninjutsu\" that he then imparted on various Chinese nobles. Takamatsu passed the title of Sōke to Masaaki Hatsumi, the recorded 34th Sōke; it was Hatsumi who largely brought the style to public attention, and subsequently resulted in wide-scale media and public attention given to ninja and \"ninjutsu\" in the Western world.\n\nThe style of Togakure-ryū has been described by its practitioners as having less-restrictive training regimens, which encourage individual personal training. One of the main goals of the training is to develop \"shin shin shingan\" () so that they can learn to properly know their opponents and defend themselves.\n\nThe \"Bugei Ryūha Daijiten\" has claimed that embellishments were made to the history of the Togakure-ryu, changing the age of things to make the school appear older than it is. This was not uncommon in many Japanese lineages.\n\nAccording to Bujinkan researcher Glenn Morris, Togakure-ryu originated in the Mie Prefecture with its creator, Daisuke Nishina. Morris explains that it was started in 1162, as a way of fighting in the war between the Genji and Heike (Taira) clans. The style itself would go on to be known as the origin of \"ninjutsu\" and its various fighting styles. Nishina was a samurai and a member of the Genji clan, which had been staging a revolt against the Heike clan because of their oppression against the Genji people. The revolt, however, was crushed and Nishina fled his home village of Togakure in Shinano Province to save his children.\nHatsumi Masaaki indicates that Nishina then changed his name to Togakure to reflect where he had come from and settled in the forests on the Kii Peninsula in the Iga Province. This account claims that it was there that Nishina met Kain Dōshi, a warrior-monk who had been politically exiled from China. From Kain, Togakure learned the fighting styles of China and Tibet and put aside his samurai code (\"bushidō\"). Hatsumi has stated that Togakure's first successor was his son, Rokosuke, and that Togakure also trained a \"deshi\" () called Shima, who would become the third master of the style after Rokosuke.\n\nAccording to Hatsumi, since historical times, the Togakure-ryū style was passed down through the years until mastership was granted to Shinryuken Toda, the 32nd Sōke of Togakure-ryū. He began teaching the style to his grandson, Toshitsugu Takamatsu, since Takamatsu was five in 1893. When he turned 19, Takamatsu was announced as the next successor of the Togakure-ryū style, becoming the 33rd Sōke. After this pronouncement, Takamatsu decided to spend a year meditating in the \"mountains between Kyoto and Nara\". Upon his return, he set out again, this time to China where he spent time in the courts of nobles as an important adviser because of his extensive knowledge from his ninja training. It is stated by Hatsumi that because of a series of incidents that occurred throughout China, Takamatsu became infamous throughout the region by the age of 25. When he turned 28, he was elected as the \"Head of Japanese martial arts in China\".\n\nBujinkan sources indicate that Takamatsu became known throughout China and Japan for his martial-arts abilities and from his \"ninjutsu\" knowledge that he imparted to various Chinese nobles. Passing on the title of Sōke to Masaaki Hatsumi (the stated 34th Sōke) it was Hatsumi who took the style public, which has resulted in the high amount of media and public attention on ninjas in the Western world. Masaaki also went on to found the Bujinkan, an international martial arts organization, in Noda, Chiba. The group combines modern Togakure-ryū and the eight other martial-arts styles.\n\nAs of 1986, there were 20 dojos for Togakure-ryū in Japan that housed 100 instructors and around 100,000 students. There were also around 50 international dojos teaching Togakure-ryū outside Japan.\n\nAs stated by the Bujinkan organization, the lineage in the line of Sōke (grand masters) of Togakure-ryū, beginning with Daisuke Togakure, is as follows:\nAs a \"ninjutsu\" tradition influenced by the samurai martial arts of the Sengoku period, the style of Togakure-ryū consists of a small number of physical escape and evasion techniques, called \"ninpo taijutsu\", and a series of sword attack patterns, or \"biken kata\". However, the majority of the art involves techniques of geography, meteorology, swimming, signaling, potion-making, fire-starting, concentration, disguise, impersonation, and other forms of knowledge suited for the unique information-gathering and infiltration roles of ninja.\n\nTogakure-ryū's \"ninpo taijutsu\" is described as being \"fundamentally different\" from other styles of Japanese martial arts that are currently taught. This is largely because, unlike these other styles, Togakure-ryū does not have a \"tightly regimated [sic] organizational structure.\" The Bujinkan teaches that while Togakure-ryū contains some \"historical \"kata\"\", which are similar to the training in judo and aikido in that they require an opponent to attack and initiate the movements. Much of the \"formality\" that other styles contain is not present in modern Togakure-ryū. Stephen K. Hayes explained that it is likely this \"freer, more flexible structure\" that makes it different, as the style has an atmosphere where \"questions are encouraged, but there isn't one part answer for every question.\"\n\nModern Togakure-ryū resembles other martial-arts in the \"footwork and dynamics\" that all styles utilize because of the nature of human movement. Hayes stated that a main goal of the style is \"shin shin shin gan\" (), which refers to the \"development of a broad vision or knowledge\" to anticipate the moves that an opponent will make and to also be able to sense danger.\n\nThe Bujinkan organization teaches that the original Togakure-ryū utilized many special weapons. One was the \"shuko\", which is a \"spiked iron band worn around the hand\". It enabled the wearer to use it as a defense against sword attacks and also to reach higher terrain, as it could be used to climb trees or walls, especially when worn with similar devices for the feet called \"ashika\". Additionally,the \"tetsubishi\" (a type of caltrop) was a \"small spiked weapon used to slow pursuers or protect doorways\". The third was the \"kyoketsu-shoge\", a blade from a double-bladed spear that was tied to a length of rope with an iron ring at the other end for the wielder to hold. In addition to use as a weapon, it could be used to \"wedge open a door, climb into a tree or over a wall, or tie up an opponent\".\n\nThere are 18 training areas that modern Togakure-ryū focuses on. The areas are constantly updated to remain relevant to modern threats that practitioners will need to face. The \"Togakure ryu Ninjutsu Hidensho\" is a Japanese manuscript written by Takamatsu, in the possession of Masaaki Hatsumi, that documents modern Togakure-ryū. The document is purported to contain the origin of the \"18 Skills of Ninjutsu\". Modern Togakure-ryu is taught in the syllabi of the Bujinkan, Genbukan, Jinenkan, and To-Shin Do.\n\nThe training areas include:\n\n\nModern Togakure-ryu and various historical claims are taught by Masaaki Hatsumi (Takamatsu's successor) and the Bujinkan organization. Criticism regarding the historical accuracy of the Bujinkan's claims of lineage have arisen from several issues of the \"Bugei Ryūha Daijiten\":\n\n\n"}

It is produced in Alameda, CA and is owned and distributed by Proximo Spirits of Jersey City, New Jersey, and is available as a straight vodka as well as in a variety of flavors.\n\nSt. George Spirits was founded as America's first eau de vie distillery in 1982 by Jörg Rupf. Rupf grew up in Germany's Black Forest to a family of distillers. He went into law and became, at the time, Germany's youngest judge. On a visit to the University of California at Berkeley in the late 1970s, he decided to stay and distill local fruit to produce eau de vie. In August 2001, Rupf met with fellow artisan distiller Ansley Coale, president of Craft Distillers and a collaborator in Germain-Robin brandy, to discuss producing flavored vodkas using a method similar to the production of eau de vie.\n\nHangar 1 Vodka was founded in 2001, with Rupf overseeing production and Coale handling design and marketing. Operations were initially based in St. George's distillery in Hangar 1, a 2,000 square-foot World War II-era hangar at the old Alameda Naval Air Station, before expanding to a 60,000 square-foot hangar in Alameda, California, in 2004. In April 2010, Hangar 1 Vodka was acquired by Proximo Spirits, who continued to produce the vodka in Alameda through St. George. until the Summer of 2014. It is now produced in the building next to St George's distillery which it shares with Faction Brewery.\n\nHangar 1 is a small batch vodka made from a blend of pot-distilled Viognier grapes and column still-distilled American wheat. The flavored varieties are created by infusing the vodka base with fresh fruit, and then distilling the vodka in a pot still. The fresh fruits are obtained in-season from farms throughout the US. The distillation process takes about four weeks per batch from start to finish. Hangar 1's flavored vodkas contain mostly unique fruits, such as Kaffir Lime and Buddha's Hand Citron, as well as experimental flavors such as Chipotle.\n\nThe Fraser River Raspberry flavor received a score of 96-100 from \"Wine Enthusiast\" in 2005, while Mandarin Blossom received a score of 97 in 2010, the Straight variety was given a score of 93 one year later, and Maine Wild Blueberry a 92 the year after that.\n\nIn May 2011, a 120-foot-long Hangar 1 Vodka blimp was introduced, touring the US to promote the vodka. It set off on a six-month tour in 2011, with stops in 30 different cities. In August 2011, during a thunderstorm, the blimp broke free of its moorings in Columbus, Ohio, and landed in a 94-year-old Ohio woman's backyard.

It is widely performed by Muslims and it is considered \"sunnah\" to slaughter a sheep for the baby and distribute the meat to the poor. Muslims also prepare a feast for family and friends in celebration for being blessed with a child. Aqiqah is a \"sunnat al mu'akkadah\" (confirmed sunnah). If the guardian of the child is capable of slaughtering a sheep for the child, they should do it. Muhammad said : “A baby is being pledged for his aqiqah, sacrifice is made for him on the seventh day, his head is shaved, and a name is given him\". If one cannot slaughter on the seventh day, someone may slaughter on the fourteenth day or on the twenty-first day.If one is not capable of doing so, then a person may slaughter any time before the puberty of the child. The aqiqah is sunnah and mustahabb; it is not obligatory at all, so there is no sin on the one who does it, or the one who delays it and does not do it at the time that is mustahabb, although he misses out on the virtue and reward of that. (He may postpone it) until he is able to do it, or he may take it out Ja'far al-Sadiq, a great grandchild of Muhammad and prominent scholar in his era, claimed that ideally the shaving, slaughtering for aqiqah, and naming of the child should be done within one hour. \nAdditionally, Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq replied in response to a question about \"Is almsgiving (equal to the price of aqeegah) would be sufficient instead of aqeeqah\" that: No, it wouldn't be sufficient; Allah likes giving food and slaughtering.\n\nAqiqah is a type of \"sadaqah\" and it is also \"sunnah\". According to another hadith from Ja'far al-Sadiq, every born is in pawn of aqeeqah; namely it would be exposed to death/kinds of calamities if they don't do aqeeqah for the child. It is Sunnah for the parents to eat from the meat of aqiqah.\n\nAbu Talib performed aqiqah for Muhammad on the seventh day of his birth and invited members of his family for the occasion, who asked \"what is this?\" to which he replied \"Aqiqah for Ahmad\". He claimed to have named him Ahmad \"because of the praises of the inhabitants of the skies and the Earth for him.\"\n\nMuhammad is said to have performed aqiqah for both Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, his grandsons, on the seventh day of their births respectively by sacrificing one sheep each; the leg of which was given to the nurse that helped with the delivery. Anointing the baby with the blood of the sacrificed animal for aqiqah was a common practice among Arab pagans and was therefore prohibited in Islam.\n"}

Parts of its production are regulated by the European Union under the protected geographical indication (PGI) status (see also \"Tyrolean Speck\").\n\nThe first documents containing the word \"speck\" date back to the 18th century, although it already appears in the butcher regulations and in the accounting records of the Tyrolean princes in the year 1200 under different names and definitions.\n\nInitially, speck was produced in order to preserve the meat for a long time. It was a method that allowed families to have access throughout the year to the meat of the pigs butchered around Yuletide. Most importantly, speck was the only opportunity the poorer echelons of society had of eating meat and of acquiring lipids. Over time it became one of the main courses for feasts and banquets. Today it is still the star of the South Tyrolean “snack” served together with bread and wine.\n\nSpeck is a product typical of South Tyrol and originates from the merging of two different meat conservation methods: curing, typical of the cured ham of the Mediterranean area, and smoking, typical of Northern Europe. As a location at the crossways between northern and southern Europe, and thanks to its unique climate, South Tyrol has blended the two methods to produce speck according to the rule of \"a little salt, a little smoke and a lot of fresh air\", consisting in light curing and in the alternation between smoke and fresh air.\n\nInitially, speck was produced only by individual farmer families. Later on, its production was taken up by the workshops of local butchers and in the 60’s it became an industrial product.\n\nSpeck Alto Adige is produced by light smoking of salted pork hind quarters followed by an approximately 22-week-long curing period and the application of a special crust of salt that must never exceed 5% of the final product.\n\nThe element shared by all small and large speck producers is their compliance with the \"a little salt, a little smoke and a lot of fresh air\" rule. Production consists in five phases: selection of raw materials, salting, smoking, curing, inspections and quality marking.\n\nTo produce Speck Alto Adige PGI lean, firm pork thighs are used. The hind quarters are selected according to the criteria defined in the raw materials specifications and trimmed following traditional methods. They are branded with the date of production start as reference for later inspections.\n\nThe speck hams are salted and flavoured with a mixture of aromas (salt, pepper, juniper, rosemary and bay). They are then dry-corned for three weeks at controlled temperatures and turned over various times to help the corning penetrate.\n\nThen the hams are exposed alternately to the smoking and to the drying phases. The smoking phase is light and is done over low-resin wood so as not to give the speck too strong a flavour, and the smoke temperature must never exceed 20 °C.\n\nIn the final phase, the hams are cured by being put up to dry in rooms pervaded by fresh air. The ageing period is defined considering the final weight of the ham, and usually lasts about 22 weeks. In this phase, a natural layer of aromatic mould forms on the hams and is then removed at the end of the ageing process. The mould layer finishes off the characteristic taste of the speck and prevents it from becoming excessively dry.\n\nThe speck that meets the production criteria imposed by the production standards and that has passed controls is fire-branded in 4 different places of the rind with the specific seal.\n\nSpeck Alto Adige PGI is protected by the European Union as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). This status is assigned only to selected products obtained according to traditional methods and in specific geographical areas.\n\nTo guarantee the quality and authenticity of Speck Alto Adige PGI, the quality consortium \"Südtiroler Speck Consortium\", together with the independent control institute INEQ (Istituto Nord Est Qualità), has developed an inspection system applied to all production phases, from meat selection to the finished product.\n\nSpeck Alto Adige PGI has a high protein content. The nutrition facts per 100 g serving are: \nIn South Tyrol, speck was traditionally a farmers’ fare, a source of energy during their work in the fields. Over time, it became one of the main courses in banquets for festivities and welcoming ceremonies. The latter function has reached our modern times, when speck, together with bread and wine, is served as the typical South Tyrolean \"snack\", offered as a sign of hospitality.\n\n\"Marende\" is the local name of the snack (\"Brettljause\" in German). The snack consists of a wooden cutting board loaded with speck, sausages, local cheeses and pickled cucumbers, served together with farmers’ bread and wine. For the \"Marende\", the speck is served in a single piece about 3 cm wide and then cut into smaller pieces.\n\nThe most famous event linked to Speck Alto Adige PGI is the \"Südtiroler Speckfest\", namely the traditional speck festival held each year in fall in St. Magdalena, Villnöß/Funes, at the base of the Dolomites mountain range. The \"Südtiroler Speckfest\", in 2010 at its 8th edition, is an event organized together by the Villnöß tourism association, the \"Südtiroler Speck Consortium\" quality consortium and the EOS – South Tyrol Export Organization of the Chamber of Commerce of Bolzano. Each year, at the festival, Hans Mantinger \"Gletscherhons\", a master in the art of slicing speck, presents his surprise creations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29272158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29272158", "title": "Mazurek (cake)", "text": "Mazurek (cake)\n\nMazurek is a variety of very sweet, flat cake baked in Poland for Easter. In some regions it is also prepared at Christmas and holiday season.\n\nAccording to Polish gastronomy coursebooks, typical \"mazurek\" is a cake that can be made of one or two sheets of short (or \"half-short\") pastry or one sheet of short (or \"half-short\") pastry covered with a sheet of butter sponge cake. The two sheets are \"glued\" together with a help of a layer of marmalade. In case of one-sheet version, marmalade is skipped or goes on top, under the layer of icing. The top of \"mazurek\" is covered with a layer of icing (i.e. sugar icing or fudge caramel cream) or jelly. It is also decorated with nut-based icing or almond-based icing and candied fruits. Traditionally, home-baked \"mazurek\" cakes are often decorated with dried fruits and nuts.\n\nIn case of one-sheet version the cake includes the borders made of rolled \"half-short\" pastry. Sometimes the shortcrust base is crowned with a lattice made of half-short or macaroon pastry.\n\nAmong other versions, often to be found in popular cook books and gastronomy coursebooks is \"Gypsy mazurek\" (\"mazurek cygański\"). A sheet of \"half-short\" pastry is \"half-baked\", covered with a layer made of dried fruit, almonds, egg yolks creamed with sugar and whipped egg white and baked again.\n\nThe cake's name may have its origins in the Mazur (or Masurian) tribe inhabiting the Mazovia region of central Poland. Another theory says it might originate from the word (Polish for mazurka), traditional folk dance in triple metre from Poland. A shortcrust pastry, Mazurek is considered one of the primary desserts of Easter across Poland. What distinguishes it from other festive dessert cakes is the abundance of decoration with dried fruit and nuts, its overall sweetness, and chocolate icing, contributing to its prolonged freshness.\n\nAlthough considered uniquely Polish, almost a seasonal national dessert, the recipe for Mazurek came to Poland most likely from the East, via the spice trade-route from Turkey in the early 17th century.\n\nIts symbolism is closely associated with the period of \"\" (Polish for Lent) thus marking its successful completion. In fact, after a 40-day fast (not a total abstinence from food by any means), which is celebrated in Christian liturgy in memory of the Temptation of Christ, mazurek was supposed to be the rich reward for adherence to faith and tradition. Although today, the religious meaning of mazurek is virtually lost in Poland, the cake is closely associated with the seasonal celebrations nevertheless.\n\nUsually, the decorative patterns includes Easter symbols like hares, pussy willows and Easter greetings.\n\nNews portal Wirtualna Polska insisted that mazurek cannot resemble any other regular cake. It is supposed to be flat in multitude of varieties, each with different flavour and lavishly decorated. Twelve of them (served side by side, as claimed by the magazine), would not be entirely out of line traditionally.\n\nAt Christmas, the emphasis on a symbolic number twelve is closely related to the Twelve Apostles at the Last Supper, celebrated by Catholics by twelve different food offerings.\n\nThe nutty mazurek (\"nutty Easter shortcake\", pol. \"mazurek orzechowy\") was entered onto the list of Polish traditional bakery and confectionery products for the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MRiRW) on 3 November 2011, described in a particular way. The shortcrust (half-short) base is prepared from ground walnuts, flour, sugar, margarine, small number of eggs and a little bit of sour cream. The frosting is a walnut cream or – according to \"Polish Food\" magazine published by MRiRW – icing made of sugar, water and milk powder melted together. The thick layer of icing is spread over baked cake and finally decorated with dried fruit (raisins), almonds and walnuts into a pattern. \"Nutty mazurek\" is supposed to be considerably flat, rectangular, by in size, very sweet with distinct aroma of walnuts, golden or golden-brown in color.\n\n\n"}

Restaurant chains devoted to Shan dishes are popular in Yangon where meeshay is one of the top choices amongst customers.

A thicker rice flour gloop is added. It is dressed with fried peanut oil, salted fermented soybeans and chilli oil, then garnished with blanched bean sprouts, pickled daikon, fried batter, crushed garlic and coriander.

Traditionally flaons were part of Easter family celebrations in Menorca, but now they are available all year round.\n\nThe flaons have different shapes, semicircular or circular, and fillings usually based on some type of cheese, varying according to the location. Sweet flaons are usually sweetened with sugar, but traditionally honey was used more often. Historically the first recorded mention of these cakes is from 1252 and they are mentioned as well in Ramon Llull's book \"Blanquerna\", written in 1283. There is a similar pastry in Cyprus known as flaounes.\n\nIn the Alt Maestrat and Ports areas the cake has a semicircular shape and it is filled with a mixture of local cottage cheese \"(brull)\" and ground almonds flavored with aiguardent and mistela. The flaons of Morella are the gastronomic icon of the ancient city. An average-sized Morella flaó is about 12 cm long.\n\nThe \"flaó d'Eivissa\" has a circular shape and has a filling of sheep or goat cottage cheese, eggs and sugar, slightly aromatized with peppermint leaves and aniseed. Flaons are usually eaten along with a glass of sweet wine or the local Liqueur \"frígola\", a thyme-based digestive beverage.\n\nThe \"flaó de Menorca\" is a pastry made with tender Maó cheese, wheat flour, olive oil and yeast. Often they include egg and a little lard in the recipe. Good Menorca flaons have to be very puffy in the middle. There are salty and sweet versions of this pastry in Menorca. Some of them have a filling, while in others all the ingredients are mixed together.\n\nThe flaonets de Calaceit ( = little flaons) are made in Calaceit, a town of La Franja region of Aragon. They are a different kind of pastry despite their name, for instead of cheese these small pastries have a filling based on pumpkin jam and honey.\nThese \"flaonets\" were one of the traditional Spanish pastries fondly remembered by painter Salvador Dalí.\n\n\n"}

There are currently at least six distilleries producing English whisky, although there are currently 14 whisky distilleries spread across England in various stages of development Though England is not very well known for making whisky, there were distillers previously operating in London, Liverpool and Bristol until the late 19th century, after which production of English single malt whisky ceased until 2003.\n\nEngland, like Scotland, has a history of producing single malt whisky. However, the production of English single malt whisky ceased around 1905 with the closure of Lea Valley Distillery, in Stratford, London, by the Distillers Company Limited, one of the forerunners of Diageo.\n\nIn the 1887 book \"The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom\" by Alfred Barnard, the following English distilleries were listed:\n\nIn 2013 The London Distillery Company began production of the first single malt whisky in London since Lea Valley Distillery closed in 1903. Two other English distilleries, also producing whisky by 2014, were The Lakes Distillery and The Cotswolds Distillery.\n\nIn 2003 two of Cornwall's drinks producers, St Austell Brewery and Healey's Cyder Farm, announced that they had begun to produce the first whisky in England for almost a century.\n\nIn September 2011 the partnership released a 7-year old single malt and opted to use the spelling \"whiskey\". Whisky commentator and author of \"The Whisky Bible,\" Jim Murray, described the whiskey as \"among the best debut bottlings of the last decade\".\n\nSt George's Distillery in Roudham, Norfolk, began production in 2006. \n\nThe company founder James Nelstrop described it as a 45-year-old dream to make whisky in Norfolk and said that barley has historically been sent from Norfolk to Scotland to make whisky.\n\nThe Cotswolds Distillery was established in 2014, and was the first full-scale distillery to be located in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Situated in a 5-acre site in Stourton in the North Cotswolds, its focus is distilling single malt whisky. It is one of only six distilleries producing English whisky.\n\nThe London Distillery Company (TLDC) was based in a former dairy cold room in Battersea, London until December 2015 before moving to a railway arch in Bermondsey.\n\nTLDC was registered with Companies House in July 2011 by Darren Rook, and investor and former microbrewery owner, Nick Taylor.\n\nEast London Liquor Company is based in a building that was once a glue factory in Bow Wharf, East London.\n\nWharf Distillery is an independent small batch distillery founded in 2014 by Laurence Conisbee to produce apple brandy from its own cider (Virtual Orchard Cider).\n\nThe distillery uses 300 litre, hand-beaten copper pot alembic stills from Portugal. Their range now includes gin \"Safine Drenc\", vodka \"Gadan Drenc\", and a range of single malts \"Fyr Drenc\". Later in 2019 they plan to introduce a dark rum.\n\nTheir first whisky, named \"Cattle Creep\" after the narrow tunnel passing under the nearby Grand Union canal, was finally released in January 2019. Matured in a Madeira cask, this very limited release was bottled at 42.9% with a cask strength \"Distiller's Cut\" at 58.8% being made available some time after. The release of their whisky will make them England's smallest whisky distillery.\n\nThe distillery takes its name from its original location on \"Galleon Wharf\" alongside the Grand Union canal, although it is currently located in the village of Potterspury, Northamptonshire.\n\nBased in Humanby, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Partnered with the Woldtop Brewery Co., this distillery has been producing single malt in a pair of classic Forsyth stills since May 2016. 'Maturing spirit' at various stages has been released by the distillery, with the first bottles of their single malt whisky due for release in 2019. Emphasis is on quality, and innovation in wood management.\n\nCooper King Distillery is an independent English whisky and gin distillery based in Sutton on the Forest, Yorkshire, which was founded after the owners spent time living in Tasmania and became inspired by the Australian whisky industry.\n\nEstablished in 2016 by co-founders Christopher Jaume and Dr Abbie Neilson, the distillery started producing gin in early 2018 and will cask their single malt whisky in the summer of 2018. It is the country’s first self-built whisky and gin distillery.\n\nCooper King’s single malt whisky is produced using a 900 litre Tasmanian-made copper pot still the only one of its kind outside Australasia, using Yorkshire barley, and aged in a variety of casks including ex-port, ex-sherry, and ex-bourbon. The distillery is powered by 100% renewable energy.\n\nCasks for the distillery are handmade at White Rose Cooperage by Alastair Simms, one of England’s last master coopers.\n\nThe distillery is named after owner Chris Jaume’s great-great-grandfather, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cooper King, who traced the family’s history back to Yorkshire in 1030 AD.\n\n"}

Obstetrical nurses help provide prenatal care and testing, care of patients experiencing pregnancy complications, care during labor and delivery, and care of patients following delivery. Obstetrical nurses work closely with obstetricians, midwives, and nurse practitioners. They also provide supervision of patient care technicians and surgical technologists.\n\nObstetrical nurses perform postoperative care on a surgical unit, stress test evaluations, cardiac monitoring, vascular monitoring, and health assessments. Obstetrical nurses are required to possess specialized skills such as electronic fetal monitoring, nonstress tests, neonatal resuscitation, and medication administration by continuous intravenous drip.\n\nObstetrical nurses are also expected to be detailed and organized because they usually have more than one patient to deal with at a time. Their mental and physical strength is important because the nurses work long hours usually standing and also have to be able to perform tasks expertly. Nurses should be emotionally stable because they will have to cope with emergencies and loss. Lastly, they need to have critical thinking skills because the patient's health could change in an instant and they have to be ready to know what to do quickly and accurately.. \nObstetrical nurses work in many different environments such as medical offices, prenatal clinics, labor & delivery units, antepartum units, postpartum units, operating theatres, and clinical research.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the professional nursing organization for obstetrical nurses is the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nursing (AWHONN).\n\nThe National Certification Corporation (NCC) offers certifications for obstetrical nurses. These include RNC-OB (Inpatient Obstetrics), a certification that allows graduate nurses who have completed a bachelor's degree in the US or Canada, who want to expand into obstetrics. It is an online exam that costs around $325, and by the end of it they will gain themselves RNC-OB certificates. RNC-MNN (Maternal Newborn Nursing) is another online exam that is for certified registered nurses, who have completed their bachelor's degrees in Nursing and have gained experienced in the area of newborn nursing, and are wanting to gain a certification/qualification in the area. The test costs around $325 and they have a 90-day window to complete the actual exam and C-EFM (Electronic Fetal Monitoring). This certification like the other two is an online citification exam, for US and Canadian graduate nursing students. To do the online certification they are required to be either a licensed registered nurse, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, physician, physician assistant, or paramedic, according to the US and Canada requirements.\n\nBachelor's degrees in either nursing and/or midwifery are required to become an obstetrical or perinatal nurse in Australia. In Australia alone there are 32 different universities that offer nursing as an undergraduate degree, such as Australian Catholic university, Charles Darwin University and the University of Notre Dame in Australia. Once completing their degree, they are required to complete their master's degree in nursing. Bachelor's degrees and jobs as licensed nurses/midwives are required in order to be accepted for the master's degree. There are 24 different universities in Australia that offer a master's degree in nursing, including Edith Cowan University, Monash University, James Cook University and University of Canberra.\n\n"}

It is traditionally made from minced \"tenggiri\" (wahoo) fish meat, although other types of seafood such as tuna, mackerel, and prawn may also be used. The fish paste is subsequently stuffed into wonton skins or filled into tofu, and then deep fried in palm oil.\n\nStreet-side batagor fried dumplings are usually served with fried tofu and finger-shaped fried \"otak-otak\" fish cakes. These batagor components are cut into bite-size pieces and topped with peanut sauce, \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce), \"sambal\" (chili paste), and lime juice. As a fried food, batagor generally have a crispy and crunchy texture; since the serving method is identical, batagor and siomay are often sold by the same vendor, with batagor being offered as a crispy variation of siomay.\n\nBatagor is ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, and can be found in street-side food stalls, travelling carts, bicycle vendors, and restaurants. However, it is most strongly associated with the West Javan city of Bandung. The dish is influenced by Chinese Indonesian cuisine, and might be derived from siomay, with the main difference being that batagor is fried instead of steamed. It has been readily adapted into local Sundanese cuisine, and today, most batagor sellers are Sundanese.\n\nBatagor began appearing in various Indonesian cities throughout the country in the 1980s, and is believed to have been invented in 1968 in Bandung. According to legend, batagor was created as a way to salvage unsold \"bakso\" meatballs. It is said that one day the \"bakso\" did not sell well, and a seller was stuck with too many leftovers. In order to cut his losses, he then came up with the idea to grind the meatballs, stuff them into tofu, deep fry them, and serve them with peanut sauce in a fashion similar to \"siomay\". This created a new dish of \"bakso tahu goreng\" (\"fried bakso [and] tofu\"), abbreviated as \"batagor\".\n\nBatagor is traditionally served with peanut sauce, although in Bandung, most batagor sellers also offer a variant served in clear broth, \"batagor kuah\" (\"batagor soup\"). The soup can be made by boiling chicken broth and adding various ingredients such as pepper, sugar, salt, leek, and celery. Chili sauce, tomato sauce, and lime can also be added to bring more flavor into the soup.\n\nBatagor is popular for its savory flavor, crispy texture of its deep fried wonton skin and tofu, and its sweet and savoury peanut sauce. The typical price of batagor is fairly affordable, with a plate of modest street-side batagor costing around 10,000 Indonesian rupiah, less than one US dollar, as of 2018.\n\n\n"}

In religious usage, it is sometimes translated as God. It is used in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament. \"Kyrios\" appears about 740 times in the New Testament, usually referring to Jesus. \n\nIn Classical Athens, the word \"kyrios\" referred to the head of the household (\"oikos\"), who was responsible for his wife, children, and any unmarried female relatives.\n\nIn Classical Athens, the word \"kyrios\" referred to the head of the household, who was responsible for his wife, children, and any unmarried female relatives. It was the responsibility of the \"kyrios\" to arrange the marriages of his female relatives, provide their dowries, represent them in court, if necessary, and deal with any economic transactions they were involved in worth more than a \"medimnos\" of barley. When an Athenian woman married, her husband became her new \"kyrios\".\n\nThe existence of the system of \"kurioi\" elsewhere in ancient Greece is debated, and the evidence is not clear-cut, but Cartledge has argued that in Sparta \"kurioi\" existed, although in Gortyn they do not appear to have done.\n\nThe term \"κύριος\" is still in use in the Modern Greek language and is the equivalent to the English terms \"mister\" (title conferred on an adult male), \"master\" (someone who has control over something or someone), and \"sir\" (an address to any male). For example, the English term \"Mr. Smith\" is translated to \"κύριος Σμίθ\" (kyrios Smith) in Greek.\n\n\"Kyrios\" appears about 740 times in the New Testament, usually referring to Jesus. The use of \"kyrios\" in the New Testament has been the subject of debate among modern scholars, and three schools of thought exist on that topic. The first school is that based on the Septuagint usage, the designation is intended to assign to Jesus the Old Testament attributes of God. The reasoning here is that at the time that the Septuagint was written, when reading out loud Jews pronounced \"Adonai\", the Hebrew word for \"Lord\", when they encountered the name of God, \"YHWH\", which was thus translated into Greek in each instance as \"kyrios\". Also, the early Christians, the majority of whom were speakers of Greek, would have been deeply familiar with the Septuagint. The second school is that as the early Church expanded, Hellenistic influences resulted in the use of the term. The third is that it is a translation of the Aramaic title \"Mari\" applied to Jesus.\n\nIn everyday Aramaic, \"Mari\" was a very respectful form of polite address, well above \"teacher\" and similar to rabbi. In Greek this has at times been translated as \"kyrios\". While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, Christians eventually came to interpret the Greek \"kyrios\" as representing lordship over the world.\n\nThe Gospel of John seldom uses \"kyrios\" to refer to Jesus during his ministry, but does so after the Resurrection, although the vocative \"kyrie\" (meaning sir) appears frequently. The Gospel of Mark never applies the term kyrios as a direct reference to Jesus, unlike Paul who uses it 163 times. When Mark uses \"kyrios\" (e.g., in 1:3, 11:9, 12:11, etc.) it is in reference to YHWH/God. Mark does, however, use the word in passages where it is unclear whether it applies to God or Jesus, e.g., in 5:19 or 11:3.\n\n\"Kyrios\" is a key element of the Christology of Apostle Paul. Most scholars agree that the use of \"kyrios\", and hence the Lordship of Jesus, predated the Pauline Epistles, but that Saint Paul expanded and elaborated on that topic. More than any other title, \"kyrios\" defined the relationship between Jesus and those who believed in him as Christ: Jesus was their Lord and Master who was to be served with all their hearts and who would one day judge their actions throughout their lives.\n\nThe \"kyrios\" title for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology, for the early Christians placed it at the center of their understanding and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.\n\nIn some cases, when reading the Hebrew Bible, the Jews would substitute Adonai (my Lord) for the Tetragrammaton, and they may have also substituted \"Kurios\" when reading to a Greek audience. Origen refers to both practices in his commentary on Psalms (2.2). The practice was due to the desire not to overuse the name of God. Examples of this can be seen in Philo.\n"}

The people and the Keraton (court) of Yogyakarta often communally cook \"sayur lodeh\" for the \"slametan\" ceremony. It is believed this can deter disasters such as wind storm, earthquake, volcanic eruption, drought and plague. It is well known in Javanese cuisine and has spread throughout Indonesia and the region. Because of Javanese migration to neighboring countries, today \"sayur lodeh\" is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n\"Sayur lodeh\" can be served with steamed rice (separated or mixed in one plate), or with sliced \"lontong\" rice cake. Although \"sayur lodeh\" basically is a vegetarian dish, it is popularly consumed with \"ikan asin\" (salted fish), \"opor ayam, empal gepuk\" or beef \"serundeng\". \"Sambal terasi\" (\"shrimp paste chili sauce\") is usually served separately.\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, when \"sayur lodeh\" is served with \"lontong\" (\"nasi himpit\"), it is known as \"lontong\". Dried squid sambal, boiled egg and coconut \"serunding\" are often added to \"lontong\".\n\n"}

The salad is typically composed of lettuce, pineapple, banana, cherry, and either mayonnaise or, according to some recipes, cottage cheese. Whipped cream may also be used. The process is as follows: First arrange a few leaves of lettuce on a plate or decorative napkin. This forms the salad's base. Then stack pineapple rings on top of the lettuce, providing a niche for inserting one whole (or more often half) peeled banana. For garnish the banana is topped with choice of cream and a cherry.\n\nThe Food Timeline History website states that \"The earliest print reference we find for Candle Salad is dated 1916. It was presented in this socialite menu; no description or recipe was included: \"Fruit Cocktail, Chicken a la King, Mashed Potatoes, Buttered Peas, Rolls, Olives, Candle Salad, Cheese Straws, Fancy Cakes, Nut Ice Creams, Candies and Nuts, Coffee.\"---Oelwein Daily Register [IA] April 5, 1916 (p. 4).\" The site lists several other references to the salad in cookbooks and newspapers throughout the 1920s.\n\nCandle salad was known as an easy way to get kids to eat fruit because of its unusual appearance. It was also considered a child-friendly introduction to cooking because of its simple construction. The recipe for candle salad was published in the 1950 edition of \"A Child's First Cook Book\" by Alma S. Lach, one of the first cookbooks written for children. It is also in the 1957 edition of the \"Betty Crocker's Cook Book for Boys and Girls\" with the description, “It’s better than a real candle because you can eat it.” \n\nA version of this salad appeared in the Mormon children's magazine \"\"The Friend\" in 2008, which included a bed of alfalfa sprouts and strawberry yogurt drizzled over the top of the banana to look like dripping candle wax. Mormon bloggers have republished the recipe. Jerilyn Hassell Pool, an outspoken LGBTQ activist and a Mormon, has contributed to the awareness of candle salads by serving a visiting group of Mormon missionaries this dish.\n\nThe Tested Recipes Institute of New York published it as a recipe card in 1958.\n\nCarolyn Andrew Lynch published a small booklet called \"The Candle Salad Story\" in 2003 with several reprinted images from cookbooks and articles.

It is made from unpasteurized colostrum milk, the first milk produced by a cow after giving birth.\n\nKalvdans has a long tradition in Swedish cuisine. It is mentioned in the encyclopedia \"Project af swensk grammatica\" from 1682. The encyclopedia mentions 'kalvost' (lit. calf-cheese) as an alternative name. The name kalvdans refers to the jiggly pudding-like consistency of the dessert. Swedish emigrants brought the tradition of kalvdans to North America, as well. It is however rarely consumed today, as very few families keep cows of their own.\n\nIn preparing the dessert, the colostrum milk is mixed with water and carefully heated. Due to the high levels of protein in the colostrum milk, it coagulates and hardens when boiled (much like eggs do). Thus the dessert gets a pudding-like consistency.\n\nDue to Swedish health regulations, unpasteurized milk may only be sold directly from the farms. Thus the capacity to produce kalvdans is somewhat limited. As a consequence kalvdans is very rarely prepared in Swedish households today. In 2008 kalvdans, along with four other Swedish dishes, was included in the 'Ark of Taste' of the Slow Food movement.\n\nA related dessert is råmjölkspannkaka. Similar desserts like kalvdans exists in other countries. In Iceland, a pudding called \"Ábrystir\" is made out of colostrum milk. A similar Finnish version is called uunijuusto. In England colostrum milk, or beestings as it is called locally, was traditionally used for puddings. In India \"Junnu\" is a dessert made out of colostrum milk from buffaloes. In Norwegian and Danish dialects, the word \"kalvedans\" sometimes refers to a type of jelly made by veal meat.\n\n"}

In the Italian dictionary—\"Vocabolario della Lingua\" (Nicola Zanichelli, 1970)—stregoneria is defined as a magical practice intended to produce harm or illness. The statement that stregoneria refers to a harmful magical practice is supported by ethnologist Elsa Guggino, who states that words related to stregoneria are always used disparagingly to describe someone practicing malevolent magic (\"Stregoneria: The \"Old Religion\" in Italy from Historical to Modern Times\", by Marguerite Rigoglioso, 2000). This is also noted by scholar Gary R. Varner, in his book \"Charles G. Leland: The Man & the Myth\", in which he states that the word \"strega\" (witch) is a disparaging term used to denote those who practice black magic, and that the term \"maga\" is used to denote those who practice white magic and healing.\n\nAnthropologist Sabina Magliocco, in her article titled \"Spells, Saints and Streghe: Folk Magic and Healing in Italy,\" remarks that \"\"At one time, many villages had a number of folk healers who could cure a variety of illnesses, They ranged from those who cured with herbs, magic formulas and prayers to professional sorcerers who were called in serious cases of magical attack. In practice, however, these practitioners overlapped, since almost any illness could be judged to be the result of a magical working. Folk healers seldom referred to themselves as streghe (although their neighbors might call them such), but as fattuccchiere, \"fixers,\" maghi (masculine plural; singular mago), maghe (feminine plural; sing. maga), \"magic-workers.\"\"\nIn contrast to the academic and historical evidence some modern practitioners of Stregoneria claim that the term is an umbrella for the Folk Magic practices of Italy. The use of the word \"Stregoneria\" to describe Italian Folk Magic is common mostly among Italian-American practitioners. Practitioners of Folk Magic traditionally would usually be called something along the lines of fixers, healers, or those who help, but to be called a witch would be a direct insult. Virtually all practitioners would have considered themselves Roman Catholic and witches in Italian folklore and Roman Catholicism are traditionally connected to the devil. \n\nPractices of Stregoneria include making \"Brevi\", or charm bags, and healing the \"Malocchio\" Although Stregoneria does indeed make use of a variety of Catholic practices, due to the use of magic Stregoneria, unlike Benedicaria, tends to be more at odds with the teachings of the Catholic Church, blending Catholic and Pre-Christian traditions.\n\nBenedicaria is Italian Folk Catholicism that, in its purest form, is completely in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church. Stregoneria and Benedicaria often overlap, specifically in the intercession of the Saints, Catholic prayers, and the use of Catholic Sacramentals. Many practitioners of both Benedicaria and Stregoneria typically make use of each other’s practices to the point where it’s almost impossible to see where one ends and the other begins.\n\nStregheria is the religious practice of witchcraft with roots in Italy. Its Italian-American branch, popularized by author Raven Grimassi, is reflective of Neo-Paganism, and makes use of much of the magical practices of Stregoneria but does not include elements of Catholic-based folk magic, which displaced the pre-Christian enchanted worldview in Italian culture.\n\n\nLINKS:\nSouthern Italian Traditionalist Craft \n"}

{"id": "30205647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30205647", "title": "Duecento", "text": "Duecento\n\nDuecento was the Italian word for the Italian culture during the 13th century.\n\nIn the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. \n\nThe trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the Hanseatic League of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The city-states of Italy expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the Holy Roman Empire; outside European powers kept their armies out of Italy.\n\nDuring this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with the creation in Italy of the double-entry book-keeping, joint stock companies, an international banking system, a systematized foreign exchange market, insurance, and government debt. Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold florin became the main currency of international trade. The Republic of Venice and the Republic of Genova dominated the trade in the Mediterranean sea.\n\nMany argue that the ideas that characterized the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th century Florence, in particular with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) as well as the painting of Giotto (1267–1337).\n\nThe Duecento was followed by the beginning of the Italian Renaissance during the Trecento.\n\nThe thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the Italian language was not the literary language in Italy. \nIt was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than Latin, French, or Provençal. The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the \"Dolce Stil Novo\" (\"Sweet New Style\", which emphasized Platonic rather than courtly love) came into its own, pioneered by poets like Guittone d'Arezzo and Guido Guinizelli. Especially in poetry, major changes in Italian literature had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.\n\nWith the printing of books initiated in Venice by Aldus Manutius, an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe source for these works expanded beyond works of theology and towards the pre-Christian eras of Imperial Rome and Ancient Greece.\n\nThis is not to say that no religious works were published in this period: Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" reflects a distinctly medieval world view. This masterpiece helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written (also in most present-day Italian-market editions), as the standardized Italian language.\n\nChristianity remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the classics coming into their own as a second primary influence.\n\nThe art of the region of Tuscany (and northern Italy) in the second half of the 13th century was dominated by two masters: Cimabue of Florence and Duccio of Siena. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, Guido of Siena, Coppo di Marcovaldo and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have originated, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting. Cimabue and Duccio both took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, Pietro Cavallini of Rome.\n\nGiotto (born in 1266) by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time. Giotto, possibly influenced by Pietro Cavallini and other Roman painters, did not base the figures that he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine-related contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of frescoes of \"the Life of Christ\" and \"the Life of the Virgin\" that he painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua set a new standard for narrative pictures. His \"Ognissanti Madonna\" hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's \"Santa Trinita Madonna\" and Duccio's \"Ruccellai Madonna\" where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made. One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.\n\nIn the early Duecento in Italy started to appear the Italian Gothic. The first Italian Gothic edifices were Cistercian abbeys. They spread in the whole Italian territory, often adapting the construction techniques to the local traditions. There were in fact brickwork edifices in the Pianura Padana, while stone prevailed in central Italy and Tuscany. In the latter was sometimes present the by-chrome wall decoration from the local Romanesque tradition.\n\nThe most important edifices include the Chiaravalle Abbey in northern Italy and the Casamari Abbey in central Italy. Among the non-Cistercian buildings of this century which were influenced by the Gothic style, though still presenting important Romanesque features, are the Parma Baptistery by Benedetto Antelami and the church of Sant'Andrea in Vercelli, also featuring Antelami's influences.\n\nThis century saw the construction of numerous Gothic buildings for the Mendicant Orders. The most important ones include:\n\nAlso notable is the civil and military construction program promoted by Emperor and King of Sicily Frederick II of Hohenstaufen in southern Italy at the beginning of the century. The most important works promoted by him include:\n\n\nIn this period some cathedrals were also constructed or finished, such as the Siena Cathedral.\n\n\n"}

The pastry, and the corresponding Mutscheltag (Mutschel Day), have probably existed since the 13th century. Mutscheln are roughly circular and come in various sizes: usually approximately six inches in diameter, but bakeries often offer breads three or more feet in diameter. They are sometimes made in sweet varieties.\n\nThere are several theories about the origin of the bread form. One is that the high central part of the bread represents the castle atop the Achalm, a hill next to Reutlingen, and the eight points of the star represent medieval guilds. The star could also have Christian allegorical meaning as the Star of Bethlehem. A third possibility is that Reutlingen baker \"Albrecht Mutschler\" invented the shape in the 14th century. This baker was mentioned first in the 1435 \"Reutlinger Heimatbuch\".\n\nOn Mutscheltag (the first Thursday after Epiphany), townspeople gather in halls and homes to play dice games, the winner of which earns parts or whole Mutschel breads. The \"Mutschelspiele\" (Mutschel games) consist of small games scored by tally marks. The games are won both independently and by grand total at the end of the hour or night.\n\nIn the neighboring community of Pfullingen, there is a similar custom with a cake called \"star\".\n\nCommon dice games are:\n\nPlayed with one die. Player number one lays the die in front of him with one dot face up. He passes it to his neighbor on the right, who rolls and adds the numbers together (one dot from player one and the new roll from player two). She passes the die to the third player, who rolls and gets a new total. Whichever player reaches 21 or higher receives a tally mark. Play as long as desired. Choose whether the most or fewest tally marks wins. Note similarities to 21 (drinking game).\n\nPlayed with three dice. The point of the game is to get the smallest three-digit \"house number.\" Each player rolls three times. After each roll, write down the die result in the hundreds, tens, or ones place. The three rolls will therefore create a three-digit number. That is, a roll of one should most properly be written down in the hundreds place so that the house number can be as small as possible. A roll of six should be in the ones place.\n\nPlayed with three dice. The player who doesn't roll a sequence (1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5, or 4 5 6) receives a tally mark against him. Alternatively, players could play Yahtzee-style where after the first roll of three dice, a player can keep one or two dice and roll the others up to two more times. If after the third roll there is no sequence, she receives a tally mark against her. Play as long as desired.\n\nPlayed with two dice. Only the numbers 3 and 5 count. If players don't roll a 3 or 5, they receive tally marks against them. Play as long as desired.\n\nPlayed with three dice. Players must roll every number from 1 to 10 twice. Roll three dice and combine them into totals. For instance, rolling a 1, 2, and 4 allows a player to score 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 by adding the dice in various ways. Rolling 3, 5, and 6 results in the totals 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9. Going around the table one roll at a time, each player must roll all ten numbers first. Once all are reached, players have to roll 1 through 10 again to \"cross off\" what was rolled before. The first player to roll all ten numbers, then cross all ten numbers off, is the winner.\n\nPlayed with three dice. Only rolls in which players roll a 1, 2, and 3 count; all other rolls result in a tally mark against the player. The group can choose to let players roll two or three times (Yahtzee-style) to try for this sequence.\n\n\n\n"}

It is prepared as follows. First a lamb or sheep is slaughtered in the Islamic way, i.e., \"halal\". Then the wool is separated in a proper and skilled way, leaving only the skin. After that, the remaining hairs on the skin are burned away with fire, after which the meat is wiped to get rid of the carbon deposits. Then the meat is cut into smaller pieces and rubbed with salt to prevent bacteria. It is also rubbed with pungent-smelling asafoetida, which is a little like garlic and serves as a preservative, a much-needed additive in a part of the world where electricity and refrigerators are rare. Having been thus prepared, the meat is strung on \"lahndi\" poles (tall poles with crosspieces which stand outside most Afghan mud-houses and serve as winter larders). \nThe best time to prepare \"lahndi\" is December, when the meat dries out within fifteen days if it is cold enough. It is commonly eaten in winter to keep a person warm and help him face the extreme weather.\n\n"}

Attributes are closely related to variables. A variable is a logical set of attributes. Variables can \"vary\" - for example, be high or low. How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word \"low\" or \"high\"). \"(For example see: Binary option)\"\n\nWhile an attribute is often intuitive, the variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing. In data processing data are often represented by a combination of \"items\" (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns).\n\nValues of each variable statistically \"vary\" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called \"binary\" (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have \"non-dichotomous\" variables and the ones with a higher level of measurement. (See also domain of discourse.)\n\nSemantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from 'traits' (characteristics that are inherent to the object).\n\nAge is an attribute that can be operationalized in many ways. It can be dichotomized so that only two values - \"old\" and \"young\" - are allowed for further data processing. In this case the attribute \"age\" is operationalized as a binary variable. If more than two values are possible and they can be ordered, the attribute is represented by ordinal variable, such as \"young\", \"middle age\", and \"old\". Next it can be made of rational values, such as 1, 2, 3... 99\n\nThe \"social class\" attribute can be operationalized in similar ways as age, including \"lower\", \"middle\" and \"upper class\" and each class could be differentiated between upper and lower, transforming thus changing the three attributes into six (see the model proposed by William Lloyd Warner) or it could use different terminology (such as the working class as in the model by Gilbert and Kahl).\n\n"}

If the mummers are welcomed into a house, they often do a variety of informal performances that may include dance, music, jokes, or recitations. The hosts must guess the mummers’ identities before offering them food or drink. They may poke and prod the mummers or ask them questions. To make this a challenge for the hosts, the mummers may stuff their costumes, cross-dress, or speak while inhaling (ingressive speech). Once the mummers have been identified, they remove their disguises, spend some social time with the hosts, and then travel as a group to the next home.\n\nAn old Christmas custom from England and Ireland, mummering in a version of its modern form can be traced back in Newfoundland into the 19th century. Although it is unclear precisely when this tradition was brought to Newfoundland by the English and Irish, the earliest record dates back to 1819. The tradition varied, and continues to vary, from community to community. Some formal aspects of the tradition, such as the mummers play, have largely died out, with the informal house-visiting remaining the predominant form.\n\nOn June 25, 1861 an \"Act to make further provisions for the prevention of Nuisances\" was introduced in response to the death of Isaac Mercer in Bay Roberts. Mercer had been murdered by a group of masked mummers on December 28, 1860. The Bill made it illegal to wear a disguise in public without permission of the local magistrate. Mummering in rural communities continued despite the passage of the Bill, although the practice did die out in larger towns and cities. \n\nIn the 1980s, mummering experienced a revival, thanks to the locally popular musical duo Simani, who wrote and recorded \"The Mummer's Song\" in 1982. Joy Fraser has noted that, \"in common with many other folk revivals, the resurgence of Christmas mumming in Newfoundland is largely based on a selective and idealised conceptualisation of the custom. As part of this revival, one particular form of mumming - the informal house-visit described above - has come to represent the custom in Newfoundland as a whole, while other forms that were equally prominent in the island’s cultural history have received comparatively little attention.\"\n\nIn 2009, the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador's Intangible Cultural Heritage office established what would become an annual Mummers Festival, culminating in a Mummers Parade in St. John's. The success of the festival has influenced, in part, another revitalization and increase of interest in the tradition in the province.\n\n"}

The brand is sold as a straight bourbon, typically in 750 mL glass bottles.\n\nElijah Craig whiskey is offered in both small batch and single barrel bottlings. The small batch variation (94 U.S. proof, 47% ABV) is also available in glass 375 mL and 1.75 L bottles. The Barrel Select expression is only available in 200 mL bottles. The company is headquartered in Bardstown, Kentucky, and its distillery (called the Heaven Hill Bernheim distillery) is in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe bourbon brand is named in honor of Reverend Elijah Craig (1738/1743 – May 18, 1808), who was a Baptist preacher, educator, and entrepreneur in Fayette County, Virginia, which became Scott County, Kentucky, following Kentucky statehood in 1792. In approximately 1789, Craig founded a distillery there. The Heaven Hill company dubiously credits him with the invention of \"true Kentucky Bourbon\" by improving the locally made distillate from an un-aged corn liquor through barrel-aging in charred oak casks, \"a process that gives the bourbon its reddish color and unique taste.\" The Heaven Hill company uses this claim, calling Elijah Craig \"The Father of Bourbon\" in its advertising of their product. Elijah Craig is most widely known by association with this brand of bourbon.\n\nThe Elijah Craig label is currently offered worldwide in four variations. A fifth expression, called Elijah Craig Barrel Select, is only available at the distillery gift shop.\n\n\n\nThe 18, 20, 21, 22, and 23 year old Elijah Craig variants may be sold in a hard canister with a leather bag.\n\nThe Small Batch bottling of Elijah Craig was originally released in 1986 with a 12 year age statement. In early 2016, Heaven Hill announced that it would drop the age statement from the Small Batch label and switch to a composite of 8- and 12-year-old bourbon to extend their stocks. The new labeling of Elijah Craig Small Batch debuted shortly thereafter without an age statement. The company also increased the maximum number of barrels dumped per batch for the Small Batch expression from 100 to 200 barrels.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, Heaven Hill announced a redesign of the Elijah Craig Small Batch and Small Batch Barrel Proof offerings.\n\nThe Elijah Craig Small Batch (94 proof, 47% ABV) offering is the only Elijah Craig release available for private barrel selection.\n\nSince 2013, there have been three releases of Elijah Craig Small Batch Barrel Proof annually for a total of 17 releases as of May 2018. Starting with release #13 and the redesign of the Elijah Craig Small Batch Barrel Proof and Small Batch labels, batch numbers were included on the Barrel Proof label to specify the batch release order, month, and year. \n\nA single barrel variant of Elijah Craig is currently available in 18- and 23-year old bottlings. Heaven Hill has offered a single barrel version of Elijah Craig carrying 20, 21, and 22 year old age statements as well.\n\nIn May 2012, it was announced that the Elijah Craig 18 Year Old Single Barrel bottling would be suspended due to limited barrel stocks near this age. Heaven Hill announced that several extra-aged releases would be released annually to augment the lack of an 18-year-old offering. Shortly thereafter, 1,300 bottles of Elijah Craig 20 Year Old Single Barrel were released. In 2013, Elijah Craig 21 Year Old Single Barrel replaced the 20 year old offering. and in 2014, Elijah Craig 23 Year Old Single Barrel replaced the 21 year old. This release continues to be offered annually. In 2015, Elijah Craig 18 Year Old Single Barrel was offered again and continues to be released annually as well.\n\nIn the San Francisco World Spirits Competition of 2010, the 18-year-old Elijah Craig Single Barrel Bourbon was awarded \"Best Bourbon\" and received a \"Double Gold Medal\" rating. In previous years, it had received a \"Double Gold Medal\" rating in 2008, a \"Gold Medal\" rating in 2004, and four \"Silver\" ratings in other years (2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007).\n\nIn 2011, Elijah Craig 20 Year Old Single Barrel (Barrel #3735) was named by \"Whisky Advocate\" magazine as \"American Whiskey of the Year\". \n\nIn 2017, Elijah Craig Barrel Proof B517 (release 14, 124.2 proof, 62.1% ABV) was named by \"Whisky Advocate\" as \"Whisky of the Year\".. Reviewer Jeffery Lindenmuth described the whiskey as \"delivering a massive mouthful of incredibly robust flavors that drape leathery oak over a gooey caramel core, sprinkled with baking spice, while candied nuts and tobacco leaf notes appear on a drying finish dusted with cocoa.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30507176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30507176", "title": "Camba", "text": "Camba\n\nCamba is a word historically used in Bolivia to refer to the indigenous population in the Eastern tropical region of the country, or to those born in the area of Santa Cruz, Beni, and Pando (the Eastern region of Bolivia). Nowadays, the term \"Camba\" is used predominately to refer to white and mestizo Bolivians largely of Spanish mixed with some Chane and other Amazonian descent born in the eastern lowlands in and around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. \n\nColla people, who are the indigenous population that lives in Western Bolivia, have always been in conflict with Camba people due to their different customs, behavior and appearance. Therefore, it may be common to hear Camba people use the term \"Colla\" as a swear word or to insult the Western population as such as it is possible to hear Collas curse on cambas.\n\nCamba may also be used as a colloquial term for \"person\", as in \"Who is that person?\" translated to \"¿Quien es ese camba?\" (ignores the ethnicity of the subject and does not change depending on gender as most Spanish nouns do). Such use is predominant in eastern Bolivia.\n\nAccording to a theory presented by Ramón Rocha Monroy, some of the Bantu languages spoken by Angolans who were sold in America as slaves, were recorded in a book published by a Jesuit missionary named Pedro Dias in 1697, called \"Arte da Lengua de Angola\" (The art of the Angola language). This publication had recorded the word \"camba\" (Friend of the color black), among other words, and its plural form \"macamba\".\n\nDuring that time, Angola, which was a Portuguese Colony, was responsible for more than a third of the slave trade on the Atlantic directed toward Brazil From there the slaves went to the Spanish colonies, from the Río de la Plata (Plata River) to Eastern Bolivia. \"Kamba\" has become part of several Indigenous languages of the region, like Guaraní, as a demonym (nickname) for black persons (different than \"hũ\", which means ‘the color black’), as well as to refer to the King Mago Baltasar. In several local Liturgies he was called \"el Santo Cambá\", or the Camba Saint.\n\nToday, the term \"camba\" is used as a demonym for \"mestizos cruzeños\", or people with both Spanish and Indigenous descent from Santa Cruz, Pando or Beni. African slaves got all the way to modern day Potosí, Bolivia, however, they were able to settle mostly in the yungas. The term could have begun as a demonym there, and then spread to the rest of eastern Bolivia.\n\nAnother hypothesis states that the word \"camba\" comes from a town in Galicia, called \"Cambados\". Some dispute this theory considering it to be improbable, insulting or politically incorrect to have a nickname for “cruceños” (persons from Santa Cruz) with an African origin. They support this based on the chronicles written by the Jesuits, which describe many traditions of Spaniards and Creoles in America, but don’t make any mention that they would use African vocabulary to describe themselves.\n"}

It was named in honor of the historic distiller Col. Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr.\n\nCol. E. H. Taylor is a premium version available in small batch, single barrel, and barrel proof versions, and as a rye whiskey. Some expressions of the bourbon and rye are bottled in bond.\n\nOld Taylor Bourbon was named in honor of Edmund Haynes Taylor, Jr., who was born in Columbus, Kentucky, in 1832. \nTaylor was a grand nephew of U.S. President Zachary Taylor. Like various other figures in the Kentucky whiskey industry, Taylor is often referred to in public relations materials as a \"Colonel\", since he held the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel. The honorary title resembles that of the military rank but is not actually associated with military service and has primarily been used for public relations purposes (e.g., by \"Colonel\" Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken). Taylor started and owned seven different distilleries throughout his career, the most successful being the O.F.C. and Carlisle distilleries, the forerunners of today's Buffalo Trace Distillery.\n\nE. H. Taylor is said to have lobbied in favor of the Bottled-in-Bond Act, a law that gave participating whiskey producers a tax break and a government certification of product quality. He was a contemporary of and acquaintance with various other notable whiskey business figures as Dr. James C. Crow, Oscar Pepper, Judge William B. McBrayer, John H. McBrayer and W. F. Bond, and was an adept businessman and public relations professional when it came to packaging and promoting his bourbon. Some expressions of the current brand continue to be offered as bottled-in-bond versions.\n\nUnlike most distilleries of the time that looked like little more than a sawmill sitting in a thicket, Taylor's distillery on Glenn's Creek, near Frankfort, was designed to resemble a medieval castle with the landscaped grounds of an estate. The distillery attracted tourists and picnickers who were given complimentary \"tenth pint\" bottles of Old Taylor.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Old Taylor bourbon was promoted with the slogan, \"Sign of a good host\".\n\nBy 1972, the historic \"castle\" distillery structure had been abandoned, and it remained abandoned but still standing in deteriorating condition for more than 40 years. Some of the material from the barrel houses was reclaimed for construction. The facility was refurbished starting in 2015, and began operating as a distillery again in 2016. The new distillery operation is not affiliated with the current owners of the Old Taylor brand.\n\nOn June 24, 2009, Buffalo Trace Distillery (part of the Sazerac Company) purchased the Old Taylor Bourbon label and barrel inventory from Beam Global Spirits & Wine (now Beam Suntory), the maker of Jim Beam Bourbon and subsidiary of the Fortune Brands holding company. The brand was purchased in an agreement where Beam bought the Effen Vodka brand from Sazerac.\n\n"}

The company is identified on the product label as the Willett Distilling Company, which was the original name of the company until its name was changed in 1984 to Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, Ltd. (KBD). In October 2012, the company announced that it would return to using the Willett name as its primary business name. Recent bottlings are identified on the labels as a small batch bourbon, whereas it was originally released as a single barrel bourbon.\n\nWillett Pot Still Reserve is bottled in a decorative decanter that received a \"double gold\" award for packaging design at the 2008 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. In addition to the double gold medal for packaging, the product was also awarded a gold medal for taste at the event.\n\n\"Malt Advocate\" Magazine rated \"Willett Pot Still Reserve\" at 90 (\"outstanding\") on a 100-point rating scale in January 2008. It also included the brand in its 2008 Whisky Awards as one of the top ten new whiskies for 2008.\n\nAlthough the company has had the word \"distillery\" or \"distillers\" in its name (and similarly uses \"distilling company\" in the various company names that it prints on labels), it did not actually operate as a distillery in the period between the early 1980s and January 2012. The company has been refurbishing and enhancing its prior distillery plant, and resumed limited test distilling on January 21, 2012 – with plans to support both column still and pot still distillation processes. However, since multi-year aging is required, their products will continue to use whiskey distilled elsewhere for some time to come. The company generally does not identify where in Kentucky its products are actually distilled, although it has been reported that most of their products have been distilled by the Heaven Hill Distillery, which has its company headquarters located close to the Willett Distillery Company. The two companies are located about a half mile from each other along the same road in Bardstown, Kentucky.\n\nAlthough the product has the term \"pot still\" in its name, it has been reported that part of the distillation process for the product was performed using the more common column still distillation method – with a pot still used only for the doubler stage.\n\nThe product is named after the Willett family which founded the company that produces it. The company began as the Willett Distilling Company. John David Willett (born in 1841) had been the master distiller for the Moore, Willett & Frenke Distillery, which he had formed with his brother-in-law Thomas S. Moore of Bardstown, and a Mr. Frenke of Louisville. In 1876, Willett fell ill and sold his interest in the company. The resulting company became the Mattingly Moore Distillery. John David Willett would, however, live on for another 38 years after this transaction. He died in 1914.\n\nStarting at the age of 15 with a five-year stint at the Mattingly Moore Distillery, his son A. Lambert Willett (born in 1883) picked up his father's profession. Lambert Willett then worked for the Max Selliger & Co. Distillery for twenty years – eventually becoming one-third owner and superintendent of the plant. A. L. \"Thompson\" Willett, Lambert's son (born in 1909), also joined him at the plant as assistant superintendent. Lambert Willett later purchased a farm and, together with his sons and especially led by Thompson Willett, founded the Willett Distilling Company on the site. Thompson and Lambert Willett used John David Willett's bourbon recipes as the basis of the whiskey that they would distill there and brand as \"Old Bardstown\".\n\nThe construction of the Willett Distilling Company began in the Spring of 1935 (just after the 1933 repeal of alcohol prohibition in the United States), and the company produced its first batch of 300 bushels (about 30 barrels) on March 17, 1936. Five years after founding the Willett Distilling Company, Lambert Willett left Max Selliger & Co. to pursue the family business full-time. Lambert Willett and at least four of his sons held substantial positions of responsibility at the company. Lambert Willett died in 1970.\n\nA. L. \"Thompson\" Willett, the son of Lambert Willett, was the president of the Willett Distilling Company. At one time, he was also the president of the Kentucky Distillers Association, and he also held a number of other positions of prominence in the community. Thompson Willett's daughter Martha Harriet Willett and other members of her generation of the family worked for the company as well, and in 1972 she married Even (pronounced Evan) G. Kulsveen of Hamar, Norway, who would later purchase the company.\n\nDuring the 1970s energy crisis, the company switched from producing whiskey to producing ethanol for gasohol fuel. This strategy soon failed when fuel prices returned to lower levels, and the distilling facilities were completely shut down in the early 1980s.\n\nKulsveen purchased the company and the property on July 1, 1984, and renamed the company to Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD), Ltd. For some time, KBD continued to produce bourbon from the aging barrels that the Willett distillery had produced before they had stopped distilling. However, as time moved on, KBD increasingly began to purchase its bourbon from other distilleries and operate as an independent bottling company. Kulsveen continues to operate the facility to this day, and the next generation of the family, including their son E. A. \"Drew\" Kuslveen and their son's wife Janelle, their daughter K. M.-B. \"Britt\" Chavanne and her husband Hunter Chavanne, are also now involved in the company. Drew Kulsveen manages production, his wife Janelle runs the gift shop and tasting room, and Britt Chavanne runs day-to-day operations, and Hunter Chavanne covers sales and marketing.\n\nThe company introduced the Willett Pot Still Reserve bourbon brand in 2008. It was originally a single barrel bourbon.\nEach bottle was sealed with a label identifying the individual aging barrel, the number of the bottle within the series of bottles for that barrel, and the total number of bottles from the barrel (example: \"Bottle No. 116 of 242 from Single Barrel 149\"). However, at some point in time roughly around 2015, it stopped being a single barrel brand and became a small batch brand instead. The bottles as still sealed with a paper labeling strip, but they no longer carry bottle numbers (example: \"Small Batch Bourbon made in Kentucky – Batch No. 16A3\"). For its definition of the term \"small batch\", the company said in 2011 that it used at most 12 barrels per batch for its \"small batch\" brands.\n\nThe company also makes another brand of whiskey with a similar name – called Willett Family Reserve. The Family Reserve brand is a limited-production barrel proof single barrel whiskey produced in bottles that resemble wine bottles in shape. (Several other brands produced by Willett, such as Rowan's Creek and Noah's Mill, also use wine-type bottle shapes.)\n\n\n"}

The prototype of the modern rally towel was created in 1975 by former Pittsburgh Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope and is known as the Terrible Towel.\n\nSince the Terrible Towel's debut, teams have used similar gimmicks, mainly using white towels (or towels with the team's colors) and giving them out to fans. The main time teams give rally towels is during league postseasons. Towels have gained much popularity as distractions to visiting players. Teams that use rally towels include the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots, and New York Jets, the NHL's Anaheim Ducks, Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, San Jose Sharks, Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers, New Jersey Devils and Dallas Stars, the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder, and the MLB's San Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and the Washington Nationals.\nThough not known as a rally towel at the time — the concept had not been introduced yet — one of the first recorded regular similar uses of a towel was at Western Kentucky University, where basketball coach E. A. Diddle waved a red towel on the sideline during games. Diddle, who coached at WKU from 1922 to 1964, originally used a plain white towel; the red towel came as a result of an effort to keep students from pilfering towels from the physical education department. A logo featuring the towel is now used by the school's sports teams, most prominently on football helmets.\n\nOn December 27, 1975, the Pittsburgh Steelers entered the NFL playoffs against the Baltimore Colts. Two weeks prior to the game, the team's flagship radio station, WTAE, decided to create a gimmick to attract sponsors, with the help of Myron Cope, the Steelers radio broadcaster. They soon hit upon the idea of the Terrible Towel – a gold or yellow towel with the words \"The Terrible Towel\" printed on the front – which would be marketed to Steelers fans. The idea was criticized by the Steelers and the local press, but on the day of the game, as Cope later recalled: \"...the Steelers gathered in the tunnel for introductions, whereupon the crowd exploded—and suddenly, by my estimation, 30,000 Terrible Towels twirled from the fists of fans around the stadium!\" The Steelers not only won the game, but went on to win the Super Bowl for the second year running.\n\nRally towels came to professional hockey by accident in 1982. Outraged by a string of unfavorable calls in a road game during the conference finals, Vancouver Canucks coach Roger Neilson draped a white towel over a player's stick and waved it above his bench in mock surrender. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost the game, but the incident restored the team's morale. Fans started waving white towels—first at the airport when the team returned to Vancouver, then at the next game—and \"Towel Power\" propelled the Canucks to victory in the series.\n\nThe first rally towels in baseball came from the Minnesota Twins. The Homer Hanky first appeared during the Twins playoff run in 1987, when they won the World Series.\n\nToday, rally towels are seen in all four major American sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL). They have also been seen in the MLS. Almost all MLB teams use rally towels now.\n\nThe first rally towel, to be used in Major League Baseball (MLB) was the Homer Hanky (a handkerchief printed with the Twins logo) of the Minnesota Twins. It gained popularity throughout the 1987 pennant race as a promotional item created by the \"Minneapolis-Star Tribune\". The Twins would later go on to win the 1987 World Series. The Homer Hanky has been present in every Twins playoff run since, including during the Twins victory in the 1991 World Series.\n\nDuring the 2010 MLB postseason, five of the eight teams in the playoffs had rally towels. The two teams in the 2010 World Series, the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers, both had rally towels. The Giants had orange \"rally rags\", but only for Game 2, while the Rangers used red, white, and blue rally towels for Games 3, 4, and 5, all of the home games in Arlington. This was the first World Series that both teams had rally towels since the 2006 World Series.\n\nIn baseball, the teams that use rally towels that are common to hand out besides the Twins are usually the Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. The Toronto Blue Jays hand out rally towels as part of their \"Fan Fridays\" promotion, inaugurated in 2010. Along with the Giants and Rangers, the Cincinnati Reds also started in 2010.\n\n\n\nFew NBA teams have rally towels. The most significant team with towels is the Cleveland Cavaliers. Fans used them in the playoffs, including when LeBron James returned to Quicken Loans Arena as a member of the Miami Heat. For the Heat, rally towels are given during their playoff runs with the phrase \"White Hot\". Other teams include the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Boston Celtics. The 2011 NBA Champions Dallas Mavericks gave out towels during their first-round series against the Blazers, and in their Western Conference Finals series against the Thunder during their championship run in 2011. The Grizzlies, Pacers, and 76ers also came into use in 2011.\n\nIn the National Football League (American football), the Seattle Seahawks use rally towels as part of their 12th-man saga. In 2010, 12th-man rally towels were given out. The Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles also hand out rally towels in the playoffs.\n\nThe NHL has many teams that use rally towels. The Jets use white towels during the playoffs for their \"Winnipeg Whiteout\" tradition. The Coyotes, who were the original Winnipeg Jets, have also used white towels for \"Whiteout.\" The Penguins have also used white towels until they switched to gold towels for \"Gold-Out\" for the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Stars use them in the playoffs, especially when they won the Stanley Cup in 1999. As the Mighty Ducks, the Ducks referred to their towels as \"Fowl Towels\". The Ducks' towels are currently orange. The Blackhawks, Bruins, Canadiens, Capitals, Devils, Golden Knights, Kings, Predators, Rangers, Red Wings, Senators, and Sharks also have rally towels. The first team that used rally towels in hockey was in 1982 by the Vancouver Canucks. Canucks fans use the term Towel Power to describe the waving of rally towels by their fans.\n\nIn other sports, rally towels are rarely used. In the Major League Soccer (MLS), rally towels were never used because of the popularity of scarves. The rally towel made a rare appearance in the 2010 MLS Playoffs, when Real Salt Lake gave rally towels to fans during a semi-final match against FC Dallas. The towels did not help the team, as FC Dallas won in the aggregate and went all the way to the MLS Cup Final. They are used in minor leagues as well.\n\nCollege teams also occasionally use rally towels. Texas A&M began using \"12th Man\" Towels in 1985 with the 12th Man kickoff team to help boost student support at Kyle Field. TCU gave rally towels to fans of the Horned Frogs in Pasadena, when TCU defeated the BCS and won the Rose Bowl over Wisconsin on January 1, 2011. South Carolina and LSU are also known to give fans rally towels. The Michigan Wolverines also give towels to students for rivalry games.\n\n"}

The most characteristic element is -bri(s), from Proto-Celtic *brigs, with its derivative *brigā, both meaning 'hill', and thence 'hillfort' and 'town'. The only type of settlement known in Galicia during the Iron Age are forts and fortified towns (\"castros\") built in hills and peninsulas. Many of them were abandoned after the Roman conquest.\n\n\nIn the 5th or 6th centuries a colony of Britons settled in northern Galicia, and their bishops-abbots attended several councils, first of the Suebic Kingdom of Galicia, and later of the Visigoths in Toledo, until the 8th century. A series of place-names have been attributed to them:\nIt also existed a village called \"Bretonos\" near the city of Lugo, in the Middle Ages.\n\nWhile there are Celtic toponyms all over Galicia, most Celtic and pre-Latin toponyms can be found along the coastal areas, most notably in the Rías Altas region around A Coruña, and in the valley of the Ulla river.\n\nSome Galician regions - usually called 'comarcas' when spanning over several municipalities, or \"concellos\" (councils) otherwise - maintain names either directly inherited from pre-Roman tribal and sub-tribal names, or simply with pre-Roman origin:\n\n\nMany Galician rivers preserve old Celtic and pre-Roman Indo-European names, most notably larger ones:\n\n\nMost of the 3794 parishes, small rural districts, of Galicia continue medieval and Roman \"villas\", frequently founded near, or even on top, of old Iron Age hillforts. Many of these parishes preserve old pre-Latin names.\n\nThe most frequent element among the Celtic toponyms of Galicia is *brigs, meaning 'hill, high place', and by extension 'hillfort'. Usually it is the second element in composite toponyms ending in -bre, -be or -ve, being cognate of Irish Gaelic \"brí\" 'hill', with the same origin: Proto-Celtic *-brigs > -brixs > -bris. A few toponyms ending in -bra proceed from a derivative -brigā 'hill(fort)', which also originated Breton and Welsh languages \"bre\" 'hill'. Some of these toponyms are:\nSimilar meaning can be attributed to Ombre (\"Anovre\" in 1114), a parish in Pontedeume; Ombre (\"Anobre\" in 971), a village in O Pino; and Ombre, another three more villages in Culleredo, Miño and Brion.\n\nAnother frequent type of Celtic toponyms in Galicia are those whose names are formed as a superlative, either formed with the suffix -mmo- or with the composite one -is-mmo-:\n\n\nOther villages and parishes have names with pre-Latin, probably Celtic, origin, specially in the coastal areas of A Coruña and Pontevedra provinces and all along the valley of the Ulla river.

The word refers to a spicy stew seasoned with paprika, or powdered chili pepper. It derives from Hungarian , which denotes a dish of meat (beef, veal, pork or chicken) stewed with onions, paprika and sour cream, known outside of Hungary as a variant of goulash. The adjective denotes anything coming from or related to , a port city in West Pomerania, northwestern Poland.\n\nThe ingredients of differ by producer, but they typically include ground fish of various kinds, tomato paste, rice, onion, vegetable oil and spices. A Polish standard introduced in 1967 specifies \"Nigerian pepper\" as the principal spice. The spread is a uniform paste of light to dark red or reddish-brown color, with visible grains of rice. The consistency is firm, ranging from slightly dry to juicy with a possible thin layer of oil on the surface. The product is sterilized and packed into steel or aluminum cans.\n\nThe original recipe for is attributed to (1924–1987), deputy director and production manager at (\"Griffin\"), a state-owned far-sea fishing and fish processing company based in . Its invention was a result of an efficiency improvement project whose goal was to find a way to use up fish scraps left over from cutting blocks of frozen fish on 's fishing trawlers. The recipe was developed in laboratories between 1965 and 1967. The company's far-sea fishing activity at that time was located off the coast of West Africa. According to , a co-founder and long-time employee of , the recipe was inspired by \"chop-chop\", a West African delicacy sampled by 's fishermen in one of the local ports. The dish contained fish, rice and a hot spice called \"pima\". In 1967, Jakacki and his colleagues were issued a certificate for rationalization proposal, which, under communist intellectual property law, awarded them limited property rights to their improvement idea and allowed to put it in place. The first cans of were manufactured in the same year.\n\nOriginally, contained scraps of various kinds of fish caught off the West African coast, such as red porgy, as well as tomato pulp imported from the southern countries of the Eastern Bloc – Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania – and a spice imported from Nigeria. The fish component changed with time, as moved its fishing fleet to new locations; at various points, the paste contained Alaska pollock and blue grenadier from the Pacific Ocean or southern blue whiting from the waters around the Falkland Islands. By the end of the 1960s, the company had left the West African waters due to the Nigerian Civil War; in 1977, it moved out of the northern Pacific Ocean when Canada and the United States claimed their exclusive economic zones; and in 1982, it had to abandon the Falkland waters because of the Argentine-British war.\nDue to its low price and long shelf life, the spread quickly gained popularity among Polish students, artists and hikers. At the turn of the 1980s, amounted to about 50 percent of 's total annual canned fish output of . The product became Poland's export hit that was sold to 32 countries, including Côte d'Ivoire, Denmark, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, Liberia, the Soviet Union, Togo and the United States. According to 's internal report, the recipe was copied in Colombia, which exported its own version of the fish spread to neighboring countries.\n\nAn economic downturn, which hit Poland in the 1980s, resulted in inferior quality of the product. The Nigerian spice was replaced with cheaper Hungarian paprika and the original fish content of 50 percent was reduced in favor of rice. It was common to find fragments of fins, scales and bones in the paste. A slump in the sales of in the mid-1980s was brought about by a public revelation that the meat of the southern blue whiting was heavily infested with \"Kudoa alliaria\", a myxozoan parasite infecting marine fish. Consumers feared that the infected fish, rather than being recalled from the market, was ground and mixed into the ; some people took grains of rice visible in the paste for parasite cysts. During the food shortages of the time, cans of the fish paste often remained on grocery shelves along with vinegar as the only food products available.\nWith Poland's transition from command to market economy in the early 1990s, Polish far-sea fishing business became economically unsustainable, bringing Gryf to bankruptcy. According to Borysowicz, was protected by a patent, but the documents were lost during the company's liquidation. Several other Polish companies tried, without success, to obtain a patent for the same product in the 1990s and 2000s. As a result, both the recipe and the name of are legally unprotected, allowing various producers throughout Poland (all outside Szczecin) to manufacture their own versions of the paste, often using freshwater fish, under the same name. In 2010, the Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development placed on an official list of traditional products, per request from the West Pomeranian regional authorities. While this recognition itself does not grant the recipe any legal protection, it is considered a first step for Szczecin towards having the paste's name and geographic indication protected under European Union law.\n\n was one of the most recognizable brands in communist Poland.

It originates from Peshawar in northwest Pakistan , and is also known as the Peshawari kebab.\n\nThe chapli kebab is a popular barbecue and street food throughout Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other parts of Pakistan, as well as in eastern Afghanistan and India. It can be served and eaten hot with naan bread, rice, or in buns and sandwiches such as in a bun kebab.\n\nMughal culinary influences in the region popularised a number of kebab dishes, resulting in local recipes such as the chapli kebab. The name \"chapli\" is said to be derived from the Pashto word \"chaprikh\", meaning \"flat\" – alluding to the kebab's light, round and flattened texture. Another theory is that the name is derived from \"chappal\", the local word for sandals – implying the average shape and size of a kebab, which resembles that of a front part of the chappal sole.\n\nThe city of Peshawar, where the recipe took hold, alone has over 2,000 kebab houses that serve the chapli kebab. Such eateries have rapidly expanded in other cities as well. Today, the chapli kebab is featured on the menu of South Asian restaurants across the world.\n\nThe chapli kebab is prepared with raw, marinated mince and the meat can be either beef or lamb/mutton. The main ingredients include wheat flour, different herbs and spices such as garam masala and chili powder, coriander leaves, followed by smaller quantities of onions, tomatoes, eggs, ginger, coriander or cumin seeds, green chillies, corn starch, salt and pepper, baking powder, as well as a seasoning of lemon juice or pomegranate seeds.\n\nThe kebabs can be fried shallow or deep in vegetable cooking oil over medium heat. Some chefs fry the kebabs in lamb fat over wood-fired stoves to lend an organic flavour. This approach is avoided by other gastronomists, citing health-conscious reasons.\n\nOnce cooked, chapli kebabs can be served and garnished with parsley, chopped onions and tomatoes, along with other accompaniments such as various chutney sauces, salad, yoghurt, pickles or nuts. The chapli kebab is best served aromatic, moist and spicy. It is considered a specialty of Pashtun cuisine and often served to guests. The kebab is commonly consumed in meals with bread such as naan, rice dishes such as Kabuli pulao, or wrapped in fast food. In winters, green tea such as kahwah may traditionally be served alongside it, while cold drinks are preferred in the summers.\n\n"}

Syrian Jewish cuisine is distinct from Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine foods like gefilte fish, knish, or other dishes more familiar as Jewish in the United States, whose Jewish community was overwhelmingly Ashkenazi. In fact, in the diaspora Syrian Jewish dishes often differ from those of other Jews because they contain rice and dried fruits and other seasonings not found in other regional Jewish foodway. Because Jews are prohibited to mix meat and dairy, Syrian Jewish cuisine differed from standard Syrian cuisine because it used oil instead of butter or lamb fat in fried foods.

Some immigrants from Italy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (the so-called \"Francos\") brought with them Italian dishes such as \"calsone\" (a sort of cheese ravioli). These foods were intermixed with the local Syrian Mizrahi and Musta'arabi Jewish cuisine creating new flavors and styles. Syrian Jews also improved versions of Syrian dishes, by emphasizing fruit and sweet-sour flavors. The Syrian Jews of Aleppo also made heavy use of tamarind. In fact tamarind based sauces are distinctively unique to Syrian Jewish cuisine.\n\nCharacteristic of the Middle East and the Indo-Mediterranean Basin, Syrian Jewish cuisine contains many elements of cuisines from a wide geographic area. Moorish and Iberian elements arrived after Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492. Syrian Jewish merchants trading along the spice route also imported spices from the Far East and land of Persia, making rose water and lime an important addition to their cuisine. Naturally, elements of Syrian Jewish cuisine were adopted by non-Jewish communities in Syria while Syrian Jews also adopted non-Jewish Syrian flavors into their dishes. Syrian Jewish dishes differ in very specific ways from other Syrian cuisines. The addition of cinnamon, cumin and allspice to dishes, as well as the use of Moroccan saffron with Persian olives and preserved lemons help to distinguish the cuisine from standard Syrian foods.\n\n"}

{"id": "30836189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30836189", "title": "Accidental gap", "text": "Accidental gap\n\nIn linguistics an accidental gap, also known as a gap, accidental lexical gap, lexical gap, lacuna, or hole in the pattern, is a word or other form that does not exist in some language but which would be permitted by the grammatical rules of the language. Accidental gaps differ from systematic gaps, those words or other forms which do not exist in a language due to the boundaries set by phonological, morphological, and other rules of that specific language.\n\nIn English, for example, a word pronounced cannot exist because it has no vowels and therefore does not obey the word-formation rules of English. This is a systematic gap. In contrast, a word pronounced would obey English word-formation rules, but this is not a word in English. Although theoretically such a word could exist, it does not; its absence is therefore an accidental gap.\n\nVarious types of accidental gaps exist. Phonological gaps are either words allowed by the phonological system of a language which do not actually exist, or sound contrasts missing from one paradigm of the phonological system itself. Morphological gaps are non-existent words potentially allowed by the morphological system. A semantic gap refers to the non-existence of a word to describe a difference in meaning seen in other sets of words within the language.\n\nOften words that are allowed in the phonological system of a language are absent. For example, in English the consonant cluster is allowed at the beginning of words such as \"spread\" or \"spring\" and the syllable rime occurs in words such as \"sick\" or \"flicker\". Even so, there is no English word pronounced *. Although this potential word is phonologically well-formed according to English phonotactics, it happens to not exist.\n\nThe term \"phonological gap\" is also used to refer to the absence of a phonemic contrast in part of the phonological system. For example, Thai has several sets of stop consonants that differ in terms of voicing (whether or not the vocal cords vibrate) and aspiration (whether a puff of air is released). Yet the language has no voiced velar consonant (). This lack of an expected distinction is commonly called a \"hole in the pattern\".\n\nA morphological gap is the absence of a word that could exist given the morphological rules of a language, including its affixes. For example, in English a deverbal noun can be formed by adding either the suffix \"-al\" or \"-(t)ion\" to certain verbs (typically words from Latin through Anglo-Norman French or Old French). Some verbs, such as \"recite\" have two related nouns, \"recital\" and \"recitation\". However, in many cases there is only one such noun, as illustrated in the chart below. Although in principle the morphological rules of English allow for other nouns, those words do not exist.\nMany potential words that could be made following morphological rules of a language do not enter the lexicon. \"Homonymy blocking\" and \"synonymy blocking\" stop some potential words. A homonym of an existing word may be blocked. For example, the word \"liver\" meaning \"someone who lives\" is not used because the word \"liver\" (an internal organ) already exists. Likewise, a potential word can be blocked if it is a synonym of an existing word. An older, more common word blocks a potential synonym, known as \"token-blocking\". For example, the word \"stealer\" (\"someone who steals\") remains only a potential word because the word \"thief\" already exists. Not only individual words, but entire word formation processes may be blocked. For example, the suffix \"-ness\" is used to form nouns from adjectives. This productive word-formation pattern blocks many potential nouns that could be formed with \"-ity\". Nouns such as *\"calmity\" (a potential synonym of \"calmness\") and *\"darkity\" (cf. \"darkness\") are unused potential words. This is known as \"type-blocking\".\n\nA defective verb is a verb that lacks some grammatical conjugation. For example, several verbs in Russian do not have a first-person singular form in non-past tense. Although most verbs have such a form (e.g. \"vožu\" \"I lead\"), about 100 verbs in the second conjugation pattern (e.g. *\"derz'u\" \"I talk rudely\"; the asterisk indicates ungrammaticality) do not appear as first-person singular in the present-future tense. Morris Halle called this defective verb paradigm an example of an accidental gap.\n\nThe similar case of unpaired words occurs where one word is obsolete or rare while another word derived from it is more common. Examples include *\"effable\" and \"ineffable\" or *\"kempt\" and \"unkempt\".\n\nA gap in semantics occurs when a particular meaning distinction visible elsewhere in the lexicon is absent. For example, English words describing family members generally show gender distinction. Yet the English word \"cousin\" can refer to either a male or female cousin. Similarly, while there are general terms for siblings and parents, there is no comparable common gender-neutral term for a parent's sibling or a sibling's child. The separate words predicted on the basis of this semantic contrast are absent from the language, or at least from many speakers' dialects.\n"}
{"id": "30856578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30856578", "title": "Turkish folk literature", "text": "Turkish folk literature\n\nTurkish folk literature is an oral tradition deeply rooted, in its form, in Central Asian nomadic traditions. However, in its themes, Turkish folk literature reflects the problems peculiar to a settling (or settled) people who have abandoned the nomadic lifestyle. One example of this is the series of folktales surrounding the figure of Keloğlan, a young boy beset with the difficulties of finding a wife, helping his mother to keep the family house intact, and dealing with the problems caused by his neighbors. Another example is the rather mysterious figure of Nasreddin, a trickster figure who often plays jokes, of a sort, on his neighbors.\n\nNasreddin also reflects another significant change that had occurred between the days when the Turkish people were nomadic and the days when they had largely become settled in Anatolia; namely, Nasreddin is a Muslim imam. The Turkish people had first become an Islamic people sometime around the 9th or 10th century CE, and the religion henceforth came to exercise an enormous influence on their society and literature; particularly the heavily mystically oriented Sufi and Shi'a varieties of Islam. The Sufi influence, for instance, can be seen clearly not only in the tales concerning Nasreddin but also in the works of Yunus Emre, a towering figure in Turkish literature and a poet who lived at the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century CE, probably in the Karamanid state in south-central Anatolia. The Shi'a influence, on the other hand, can be seen extensively in the tradition of the \"aşık\"s, or \"ozan\"s, who are roughly akin to medieval European minstrels and who traditionally have had a strong connection with the Alevi faith, which can be seen as something of a homegrown Turkish variety of Shi'a Islam. However, in Turkish culture such a neat division into Sufi and Shi'a is scarcely possible: for instance, Yunus Emre is considered by some to have been an Alevi, while the entire Turkish \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition is permeated with the thought of the Bektashi Sufi order, which is itself a blending of Shi'a and Sufi concepts. The word \"aşık\" (literally, \"lover\") is in fact the term used for first-level members of the Bektashi order.\n\nBecause the Turkish folk literature tradition extends in a more or less unbroken line from about the 10th or 11th century CE to today, it is perhaps best to consider the tradition from the perspective of genre. There are three basic genres in the tradition: epic; folk poetry; and folklore.\n\nThe Turkish epic tradition properly begins with the \"Book of Dede Korkut\", which is in a language recognizably similar to modern Turkish and which developed from the oral traditions of the Oghuz Turks, that branch of the Turkic peoples which migrated towards western Asia and eastern Europe through Transoxiana beginning in the 9th century CE. The \"Book of Dede Korkut\" continued to survive in the oral tradition after the Oghuz Turks had, by and large, settled in Anatolia.\n\nThe \"Book of Dede Korkut\" was the primary element of the Turkish epic tradition in Anatolia for several centuries. Another epic circulating at the same time, however, was the so-called \"Epic of Köroğlu\", which concerns the adventures of Rüşen Ali (\"Köroğlu\", or \"son of the blind man\") to exact revenge for the blinding of his father. The origins of this epic are somewhat more mysterious than those of the \"Book of Dede Korkut\": many believe it to have arisen in Anatolia sometime between the 15th and 17th centuries CE; more reliable testimony, though, seems to indicate that the story is nearly as old as that of the \"Book of Dede Korkut\", dating from around the dawn of the 11th century CE. Complicating matters somewhat is the fact that Köroğlu is also the name of a poet of the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition.\n\nThat the epic tradition in Turkish literature may not have died out entirely can be seen from the \"Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin\" (\"Şeyh Bedreddin Destanı\"), published in 1936 by the poet Nâzım Hikmet Ran (1901–1963). This long poem—which concerns an Anatolian shaykh's rebellion against the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed I—is a sort of modern, written epic that nevertheless draws upon the same independent-minded traditions of the Anatolian people that can be seen in the \"Epic of Köroğlu\". Also, many of the works of the 20th-century novelist Yaşar Kemal (1923–2015), such as his long 1955 novel \"Memed, My Hawk\" (\"İnce Memed\"), can be considered modern prose epics.\n\nThe folk poetry tradition in Turkish literature, as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sufi and Shi'a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition—which is still alive today—the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two traditions of Turkish folk poetry:\n\n\nMuch of the poetry and song of the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century CE, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known \"aşık\"s from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century CE); Karacaoğlan (1606?–1689?), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century \"aşık\"s; Dadaloğlu (1785?–1868?), who was one of the last of the great \"aşık\"s before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The \"aşık\"s were essentially minstrels who travelled through Anatolia performing their songs on the \"bağlama\", a mandolin-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1938–2012), and many others.\nThe tradition of \"tekke\" literature shared a similar basis with the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition in that the poems were generally intended to be sung, generally in religious gatherings, making them somewhat akin to Western hymns (Turkish \"ilahi\"). One major difference from the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition, however, is that—from the very beginning—the poems of the \"tekke\" tradition were written down. This was because they were produced by revered religious figures in the literate environment of the \"tekke\", as opposed to the milieu of the \"aşık\"/\"ozan\" tradition, where the majority could not read or write. The major figures in the tradition of \"tekke\" literature are: Yunus Emre (1240?–1320?), who is one of the most important figures in all of Turkish literature; Süleyman Çelebi (?–1422), who wrote a highly popular long poem called \"Vesiletü'n-Necat\" (\"The Means of Salvation\", but more commonly known as the \"Mevlid\"), concerning the birth of the Prophet Muhammad; Kaygusuz Abdal (1397–?), who is widely considered the founder of Alevi/Bektashi literature; and Pir Sultan Abdal (?–1560), whom many consider to be the pinnacle of that literature.\n\nThe tradition of folklore—folktales, jokes, legends, and the like—in the Turkish language is very rich. Perhaps the most popular figure in the tradition is the aforementioned Nasreddin (known as \"Nasreddin Hoca\", or \"teacher Nasreddin\", in Turkish), who is the central character of thousands of jokes. He generally appears as a person who, though seeming somewhat stupid to those who must deal with him, actually proves to have a special wisdom all his own:\n\n\"One day, Nasreddin's neighbor asked him, \"Teacher, do you have any forty-year-old vinegar?\"—\"Yes, I do,\" answered Nasreddin.—\"Can I have some?\" asked the neighbor. \"I need some to make an ointment with.\"—\"No, you can't have any,\" answered Nasreddin. \"If I gave my forty-year-old vinegar to whoever wanted some, I wouldn't have had it for forty years, would I?\"\"\n\nSimilar to the Nasreddin jokes, and arising from a similar religious milieu, are the Bektashi jokes, in which the members of the Bektashi religious order—represented through a character simply named \"Bektaşi\"—are depicted as having an unusual and unorthodox wisdom, one that often challenges the values of Islam and of society.\n\nAnother popular element of Turkish folklore is the shadow theater centered around the two characters of Karagöz and Hacivat, who both represent stock characters: Karagöz—who hails from a small village—is something of a country bumpkin, while Hacivat is a more sophisticated city-dweller. Popular legend has it that the two characters are actually based on two real persons who worked for Osman I—the founder of the Ottoman dynasty—in the construction of his palace at Bursa in the early 14th century CE. The two workers supposedly spent much of their time entertaining the other workers, and were so funny and popular that they interfered with work on the palace, and were subsequently put to death.\n"}

{"id": "30860614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30860614", "title": "Mustard (condiment)", "text": "Mustard (condiment)\n\nMustard is a condiment made from the seeds of a mustard plant (white/yellow mustard, \"Sinapis alba\"; brown/Indian mustard, \"Brassica juncea\"; or black mustard, \"Brassica nigra\").\n\nThe whole, ground, cracked, or bruised mustard seeds are mixed with water, vinegar, lemon juice, wine, or other liquids, salt, and often other flavorings and spices, to create a paste or sauce ranging in color from bright yellow to dark brown. The taste of mustard ranges from sweet to spicy.\n\nCommonly paired with meats and cheeses, mustard is also added to sandwiches, hamburgers, corn dogs, and hot dogs. It is also used as an ingredient in many dressings, glazes, sauces, soups, and marinades. As a cream or as individual seeds, mustard is used as a condiment in the cuisine of India and Bangladesh, the Mediterranean, northern and southeastern Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa, making it one of the most popular and widely used spices and condiments in the world.\n\nThe English word \"mustard\" derives from the Anglo-Norman \"mustarde\" and Old French \"mostarde\" (Modern French is \"moutarde\"). The first element is ultimately from Latin \"mustum\", (\"must\", young wine)—the condiment was originally prepared by making the ground seeds into a paste with must. The second element comes also from Latin \"ardens\", (hot, flaming). It was first attested in English in the late 13th century, though it was found as a surname a century earlier.\n\nArcheological excavations in the Indus Valley (Indian Subcontinent) have revealed that mustard was cultivated there. That civilization existed until about 1800 BC.\n\nThe Romans were probably the first to experiment with the preparation of mustard as a condiment. They mixed unfermented grape juice (the must) with ground mustard seeds (called \"sinapis\") to make \"burning must\", \"mustum ardens\" — hence \"\". A recipe for mustard appears in \"De re coquinaria\", the anonymously compiled Roman cookbook from the late fourth or early fifth century; the recipe calls for a mixture of ground mustard, pepper, caraway, lovage, grilled coriander seeds, dill, celery, thyme, oregano, onion, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil, and was intended as a glaze for spit-roasted boar.\n\nThe Romans likely exported mustard seed to Gaul, and by the 10th century, monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris absorbed the mustard-making knowledge of Romans and began their own production. The first appearance of mustard makers on the royal registers in Paris dates back to 1292. Dijon, France, became a recognized center for mustard making by the 13th century. The popularity of mustard in Dijon is evidenced by written accounts of guests consuming of mustard creme in a single sitting at a gala held by the Duke of Burgundy in 1336. In 1777, one of the most famous Dijon mustard makers, Grey-Poupon, was established as a partnership between Maurice Grey, a mustard maker with a unique recipe containing white wine; and Auguste Poupon, his financial backer. Their success was aided by the introduction of the first automatic mustard-making machine. In 1937, Dijon mustard was granted an \"Appellation d'origine contrôlée\". Due to its long tradition of mustard making, Dijon is regarded as the mustard capital of the world.\n\nThe early use of mustard as a condiment in England is attested from the year 1390 in the book \"The Forme of Cury\" which was written by King Richard II's master cooks. It was prepared in the form of mustard balls—coarse-ground mustard seed combined with flour and cinnamon, moistened, rolled into balls, and dried—which were easily stored and combined with vinegar or wine to make mustard paste as needed. The town of Tewkesbury was well known for its high-quality mustard balls, originally made with ground mustard mixed with horseradish and dried for storage, which were then exported to London and other parts of the country, and are even mentioned in William Shakespeare's play \"King Henry the Fourth, Part II\".\n\nThe use of mustard as a hot dog condiment is said to have been first seen in the US at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, when the bright-yellow French's mustard was introduced by the R.T. French Company.\n\nMustard is most often used at the table as a condiment on cold meats.It is also used as an ingredient in mayonnaise, vinaigrette, marinades, and barbecue sauce. It is also a popular accompaniment to hot dogs, pretzels, and bratwurst. In the Netherlands and northern Belgium, it is commonly used to make mustard soup, which includes mustard, cream, parsley, garlic, and pieces of salted bacon. Mustard as an emulsifier can stabilize a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids, such as oil and water. Added to Hollandaise sauce, mustard can inhibit curdling.\n\nThe amounts of various nutrients in mustard seed are to be found in the USDA National Nutrient Database. As a condiment, mustard averages about 5 kcal per teaspoon. Some of the many vitamins and nutrients found in mustard seeds are selenium and omega 3 fatty acid.\n\nThe many varieties of prepared mustards have a wide range of strengths and flavors, depending on the variety of mustard seed and the preparation method. The basic taste and \"heat\" of the mustard are determined largely by seed type, preparation, and ingredients. Preparations from the white mustard plant (\"Sinapis alba\") have a less pungent flavor than preparations of black mustard (\"Brassica nigra\") or brown Indian mustard (\"Brassica juncea\"). The temperature of the water and concentration of acids such as vinegar also determine the strength of a prepared mustard; hotter liquids and stronger acids denature the enzymes that make the strength-producing compounds. Thus, \"hot\" mustard is made with cold water, whereas using hot water produces a milder condiment, all else being equal.\n\nMustard oil can be extracted from the chaff and meal of the seed.\n\nThe mustard plant ingredient itself has a sharp, hot, pungent flavor.\n\nMixing ground mustard seeds with water causes a chemical reaction between two compounds in the seed: the enzyme myrosinase and various glucosinolates such as sinigrin, myrosin, and sinalbin. The myrosinase enzyme turns the glucosinolates into various isothiocyanate compounds known generally as mustard oil. The concentrations of different glucosinolates in mustard plant varieties, and the different isothiocyanates that are produced, make different flavors and intensities.\n\n\nPrepared mustard condiment may also have ingredients giving salty, sour (vinegar), and sweet flavors. Turmeric is often added to commercially prepared mustards, mainly to give them a yellow color.\n\nPrepared mustard is sold in glass jars, plastic bottles, or metal squeeze tubes.\nBecause of its antibacterial properties, mustard does not require refrigeration for safety; it will not grow mold, mildew, or harmful bacteria. Mustard can last indefinitely without becoming inedible or harmful, though it may dry out, lose flavor, or brown from oxidation. Mixing in a small amount of wine or vinegar may improve dried-out mustard. Some types of prepared mustard stored for a long time may separate, which can be corrected by stirring or shaking. If stored unrefrigerated for a long time, mustard can acquire a bitter taste.\n\nWhen whole mustard seeds are wetted and crushed, an enzyme is activated that releases pungent sulphurous compounds; but they quickly evaporate. An acidic liquid, such as wine or vinegar, produces a longer-lasting paste. However, even then prepared mustard loses its pungency over time; the loss can be slowed by keeping a sealed container (opaque or in the dark) in a cool place or refrigerator.\n\nLocations renowned for their mustard include Dijon (medium-strength) and Meaux in France; Norwich (very hot) and Tewkesbury's mustard, in the United Kingdom; and Düsseldorf (hot), Bautzen (medium-strength) and Bavaria in Germany. They vary in the subsidiary spices and in the preparation of the mustard seeds. The mustard husks may be ground with the seeds, or winnowed away after the initial crushing; \"whole-grain mustard\" retains some unground or partially ground mustard seeds. Bavarian sweet mustard contains very little acid, substituting copious amounts of sugar for preservation. The Tecuci mustard from Romania is a sweet variety very popular in Eastern Europe and is suitable for grilled meats such as \"mititei\". Sometimes, prepared mustard is simmered to moderate its bite, and sometimes it is aged. Irish mustard is a whole-grain mustard blended with whiskey, stout (commonly Guinness), or honey. \"Karashi\" is a spicy Japanese mustard.\n\nHot table mustard may easily be prepared by the home cook by mixing \"powdered mustard\" (ground mustard seed, turmeric, and wheat flour) to the desired consistency with water or an acidic liquid such as wine, vinegar, or beer, and letting it stand for 10 minutes. It is usually prepared immediately before a meal; mustard prepared with water, in particular, is more pungent, but deteriorates rapidly.\n\nDijon mustard originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon replaced the usual ingredient of vinegar with verjuice, the acidic \"green\" juice of unripe grapes. Most mustards from Dijon today contain white wine rather than verjuice.\n\n\"Dijon mustard\" is not a protected food name. While mustard factories still operate in Dijon and adjoining towns, most mustard described as \"Dijon\" is manufactured elsewhere. Even that produced in France is made almost exclusively from Canadian mustard seed, particularly from the province of Saskatchewan, which produces 80% of the world's mustard seed exports.\n\nIt is bright yellow in color with a thicker consistency than the mild American mustard. The most famous brand of English mustard is Colman's, which first produced their variety in 1814 as a powder in their yellow tin. William Taylor, based in Newport Pagnell, was the first person to sell English mustard in a prepared format in 1830.\n\nThis dark brown, mild, and tangy/sweet mustard, despite its name, is not French in origin. \"French\" mustard is particular to the UK and was invented by Colman's in 1936. It became a popular accompaniment to steak in particular. Colman's ceased production of French mustard in 2001 after Unilever, which now own Colman's, were ordered to stop selling it by the EU, following its takeover of rival mustard-maker Amora Maille in 2000. Many British supermarkets still offer their own version of French mustard.\n\nThe most commonly used mustard in the United States – and tied with Dijon in Canada – is American mustard sold as \"yellow mustard\" (although most prepared mustards are yellow) and commonly referred to as just \"mustard\". A very mild prepared mustard colored bright yellow from turmeric powder, it was supposedly introduced in 1904 by George J. French as \"cream salad mustard\". American mustard is regularly used to top hot dogs, sandwiches, pretzels, and hamburgers. It is also an ingredient of many potato salads, barbecue sauces, and salad dressings. It is commonly referred to as \"hot dog\", \"ball park\", \"yellow\", \"sunshine\", or \"prepared\" mustard for these applications. In Austria, it is called \"Amerikanischer Senf\" (American mustard), and is regarded as much milder than local varieties.\n\nSpicy brown mustard is also commonly used in the United States. The seeds are coarsely ground, giving it a speckled brownish-yellow appearance. In general, it is spicier than American mustard. Some \"deli-style\" mustard incorporates horseradish, which actually makes it a little spicier than spicy brown. A variety popular in Louisiana is called Creole mustard. Typically, Creole mustard is much coarser than spicy brown.\n\nBeer mustard, which uses beer instead of vinegar, allegedly originated in the 20th century somewhere in the United States Midwest and has remained a popular local condiment.\n\nIn whole-grain mustard, also known as granary mustard, the seeds are mixed whole with other ingredients. Different flavors and strengths can be achieved through different blends of mustard seed species. Groningen mustard is an example of a mustard with partially ground grains.\n\nHoney mustard, as its name suggests, is a blend of mustard and honey, typically mixed in a 1:1 ratio. It is commonly used both on sandwiches and as a dip for finger foods such as chicken strips. It can also be combined with vinegar or olive oil to make a salad dressing.\n\nCombinations of English mustard with honey or Demerara sugar are used in British cuisine to coat grilled lamb cutlets or pork chops.\n\nChili peppers of various strengths are used to make a variety of mustards more piquant than plain mustard. Peppers or hot sauce made from peppers are added to mustards of different base styles such as yellow mustard, brown mustard, or spirited mustards.\n\nFruit and mustard have been combined since the Lombard creation of \"mostarda di frutta\" in the 14th century. Large chunks of fruit preserved in a sweet, hot mustard syrup were served with meat and game, and were said to be a favorite of the Dukes of Milan. Traditional variations of fruit mustards include apple mustard (traditional in Mantua and very hot), quince\" mostarda\" (or \"mostarda vicentina\", mild and with a jam-like appearance), and cherry mustard. In various areas of Italy, the term \"mostarda\" refers to sweet condiments made with fruit, vegetables, and \"mosto\", grape juice that gets simmered until syrupy.\n\nThe term \"hot mustard\" is used for mustards prepared to bring out the natural piquancy of the mustard seeds. This is enhanced by using pungent black or brown mustard seeds rather than the white mustard seeds used to make mild mustards.\n\nSpirited mustards are made with alcoholic spirits. Variations include Arran mustards with whisky, brandied peach mustard, cognac mustard, Irish \"pub\" mustard with whiskey, and Jack Daniel's mustard.\n\nSweet mustard is from Bavaria, made from kibbled mustard seed sweetened with sugar, apple sauce, or honey. It is typically served with \"Weißwurst\" or \"Leberkäse\". \"Weisswurstsenf\", mustard for \"Weisswursten\", is the most frequent name for this sweet mustard. Regional differences exist within Bavaria toward the combination of sweet mustard and \"Leberkäse\". Other types of sweet mustards are known in Austria and Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown mustard is a spice that was cultivated in the Indus Valley Civilization and is one of the important spices used in the Indian subcontinent today. \"Kasundi\" is a popular Bengali spicy relish of mustard. Many different kinds of \"kasundi\" are available. It is used during regular meals and with a variety of fruits and street food.\n\nA strong mustard can make the eyes water, and sting the tongue, palate, and throat. Home-made mustards may be hotter and more intensely flavored than most commercial preparations.\n\nAny part of the mustard plant can also, rarely, cause allergic reactions in some people, including anaphylaxis. Since 2005, packaged food in the European Union must show on its label if it contains mustard.\n\n<br>\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30861623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30861623", "title": "Rum baba", "text": "Rum baba\n\nA rum baba or baba au rhum is a small yeast cake saturated in syrup made with hard liquor, usually rum, and sometimes filled with whipped cream or pastry cream. It is most typically made in individual servings (about a 5 cm tall, slightly tapered cylinder) but sometimes can be made in larger forms similar to those used for Bundt cakes.\n\nThe batter for baba includes eggs, milk and butter.\n\nThe original form of the baba was similar to the babka, a tall, cylindrical yeast cake (babka is still baked in Ukraine, Poland and in Ukrainian and Polish communities over the world). The name means \"old woman\" or \"grandmother\" in the Slavic languages; \"babka\" is a diminutive of \"baba\".\n\nThe modern baba au rhum (rum baba), with dried fruit and soaking in rum, was invented in the rue Montorgueil in Paris, France, in 1835 or before. Today, the word \"baba\" in France and almost everywhere else outside eastern Europe usually refers specifically to the rum baba.\n\nThe original baba was introduced into France in the 18th century via Lorraine. This is attributed to Stanislaus I, the exiled king of Poland. The \"Larousse Gastronomique\" has reported that Stanislaus had the idea of soaking a dried Gugelhupf (a cake roughly similar to the baba and common in Alsace-Lorraine when he arrived there) or a baba with alcoholic spirit. Another version is that when Stanislaus brought back a baba from one of his voyages it had dried up. Nicolas Stohrer, one of his pâtissiers (or possibly just apprentice pâtissiers at the time), solved the problem by adding Malaga wine, saffron, dried and fresh raisin and crême pâtissière. The writer Courchamps stated in 1839 that the descendants of Stanislaus served the baba with a saucière containing sweet Malaga wine mixed with one sixth of Tanaisie liqueur.\n\nStohrer followed Stanislaus's daughter Marie Leszczyńska to Versailles as her pâtissier in 1725 when she married King Louis XV, and founded his pâtisserie in Paris in 1730. One of his descendants allegedly had the idea of using rum in 1835. While he is believed to have done so on the fresh cakes (right out of the mold), it is a common practice today to let the baba dry a little so that it soaks up better. Later, the recipe was refined by mixing the rum with aromatized sugar syrup.\n\nThe baba is also popular in Naples, and became a popular Neapolitan specialty under the name \"babà\" or \"babbà\".\n\nThe pastry has appeared on restaurant menus in the United States since 1899, if not earlier.\n\nIn 1844, the Julien Brothers, Parisian pâtissiers, invented the Savarin, which is strongly inspired by the \"baba au rhum\" but is soaked with a different alcoholic mixture and uses a circular (ring) cake mould instead of the simple round (cylindrical) form. The ring form is nowadays often associated with the \"baba au rhum\" as well, and the name \"Savarin\" is also sometimes given to the rum-soaked circular cake.\n\n\n\n"}

Pom-poms are shaken by cheerleaders, pom or dance teams, and sports fans during spectator sports.\n\n\n\"Pom-pom\" is derived from the French word \"pompon\", which refers to a small decorative ball made of fabric or feathers. It also means an \"ornamental round tuft\" and originally refers to its use on a hat, or an \"ornamental tuft; tuft-like flower head.\"\n\nCheerleaders use pom-poms at sports events for six reasons:\n\n\nMost often, pom-poms are used in pairs (one in each hand), but this may vary with the particular requirements of the choreography of a dance or cheer.\n\nCheerleading pom-poms come in a variety of shapes, styles, colors, color combinations, and sizes. Shiny metallic pom-poms have become very popular in recent years.\n\nPom-poms are also waved by sports fans, primarily at college and high school sports events in the United States, Cheap, light-weight \"faux\" pom-poms in team colors are sometimes given or sold to spectators at such events.\n\nMany schools and universities have dance teams in addition to their cheerleading groups. The dance teams may also use pom-poms occasionally, but many high school dance teams are now referred to as \"Poms\" squads. These squads are similar to drill teams, but usually have several routines that they strictly use pom-poms. Pom-poms have also come to be included in dance competitions in the United States. In many states, \"Pom\" or \"Open Pom\" is considered its own style of dance during competitions. For this style dancers use pom-poms and moves that are specifically choreographed to include pom-poms, but usually incorporate hip-hop and jazz choreography as well. When judging a routine in the Pom or Open Pom category, judges typically look for clean, sharp movements and complete synchronization of the team. These dances occasionally use different colored pom-poms and outfits to convey a theme and the dance team will create pictures from their pom-poms that relate to this theme.\n\nIn Australia, the term \"flogger\" is sometimes used rather than \"pom-pom\". Floggers are very large, heavy pom-poms in the team's colours. They sometimes require more than one person to lift them, and they are waved about when a goal is scored.\n\nFloggers are an important part of Australian rules football culture and cheer-squads.\n\nSmall pom-poms may be used to adorn hats (such as Tam o' Shanters and some styles of the tuque), socks, fringed dresses, and other kinds of clothing.\n\nPom-poms form a conspicuous part of the uniform of French naval personnel, being sewn onto the crown of their round cap. Belgian sailors wear a light blue version.\n\nTraditional Italian wedding shoes have small pom-poms, as do some Turkish dancing shoes.\n\nRoman Catholic clergy wear the biretta. The colour of its pom-pom denotes the wearer's rank. Priests wear a black biretta with a black pom. Protonotaries and domestic prelates (now prelates of honour) have a scarlet pom on their black birettas, and Papal Chamberlains (now Chaplains to His Holiness) wear a Roman purple pom on their black birettas.\n\nBishops and archbishops wear a Roman purple biretta with matching pom. The scarlet birettas of the cardinals have no pom, only a red loop. There is no papal biretta.\n\nSome religious orders and congregations have unique birettas, such as the Norbertines who wear a white biretta with a white pom. Some St. Francis fathers wear a brown biretta with a black pom. Other orders may wear a black biretta with a white, green, or blue pom, or the black biretta of the secular priesthood.\n\nIn reference to Scottish Highland dress and Scottish military uniforms, the small pom-pom on the crown of such hats as the Balmoral, the Glengarry, and the Tam o' Shanter is called a \"toorie.\"\n\nThe toorie is generally made of yarn and is traditionally red on both Balmorals and Glengarries (although specific units have used other colours). It has evolved into the smaller pom-pom found on older-style golf caps and the button atop baseball caps.\n\nScots refer to any such hat decoration as a toorie, irrespective of the headgear.\n\nPom-poms are sometimes used as children's toys. They are a common feature at the ends of the handlebars of children's tricycles and bicycles. They are also used in children's artistic crafts to add texture and color.\n"}
{"id": "30864202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30864202", "title": "68W", "text": "68W\n\n68W (often pronounced as sixty-eight whiskey using the NATO phonetic alphabet) is the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) for the United States Army's Combat Medic Specialist (Combat Medic). This specialty is open to males and females as well as allowing color vision deficient personnel.\n\nThe primary role of \"68W\" combat medic specialists in the U.S. Army is providing medical treatment to wounded soldiers. Other nations and services also have similarly-trained personnel, but this discussion and the following details apply only to those within the United States Army. These medics serve as the basic or first tier of the Army medical system accompanying units as small as platoons (approximately 12-40 soldiers) during training and deployments. Medics provide initial emergency medical care, evacuation, and supervision to other soldiers with medical training (such as Combat Lifesavers) as well as provide medical advice to unit chains of command.\n\nIn addition to first responder or combat medical support, medics provide paraprofessional care in medical treatment facilities—battalion aid stations, clinics, hospitals, etc.--to soldiers, military dependents, and authorized civilian personnel. In this capacity, healthcare specialists work under the supervision and purview of physician assistants and physicians and alongside other medical professionals.\n\nHealthcare specialists are initially trained as Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians (at the EMT-B level) with additional training in trauma and Army specific techniques and procedures. Maintenance of civilian accreditation is currently required and further education is commonly offered including the opportunity to add additional skill training or—with acceptable civilian education—application to the Inter-service Physician Assistant Program.\n\nCivilian equivalents are difficult to assess given the broad range of skills and training healthcare specialists may have but most healthcare specialists without additional specialized training are trained in or work in areas overlapping civilian EMTs, medical assistants, patient administration personnel, office managers, schedulers, ambulance drivers, pharmacy technicians, phlebotomists, patient care assistants, and others.\n\nAdvanced level healthcare specialists who have not specialized generally assume more administrative duties in medical sections or treatment facilities as well as training and supervisory duties while maintaining perishable treatment skills.\n\nSkill levels are appended to the MOS to identify positions a soldier may be assigned to and are followed by a letter code, Special Qualification Identifier, identifying special skills such as parachute qualification (\"P\") or Airborne Ranger qualification (\"V\"). When no appropriate skill modifier is used, a letter \"O\", erroneously read as a zero \"0\". For example, a healthcare specialist would be awarded MOS 68W1O.\n\n\nSkill identifiers are awarded to personnel with additional training in a particular specialty and affects what positions a soldier holding the skill identifier may be assigned to. Most require formal school training.\n\nCurrently known as 68W, the Army's basic medical MOS was changed, effective October 1, 2006. During the Vietnam War era, the MOS codes 91W (91 Whiskey, nuclear medicine specialist), 91B (91 Bravo, medical NCO) and 91A (91 Alpha, medical corpsman) were used.\n\nThe Department of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel issued a notice for future change for the MOS 91B and 91C (Licensed Practical Nurse) in September 1999. The notice established the transition of personnel holding both MOSs to 91W to begin on 1 October 2001 and end on 30 September 2007. The 91W MOS required additional training and the maintenance of civilian EMT certification which was previously optional for soldiers. Army personnel holding MOS 91C would become 91Ws (and later 68Ws) with an additional skill identifier of M6. During the transitory period, all 91B and 91C classified soldiers were given the Y2 identifier until completion of additional training to become 91W, reclassification to a different MOS, or discharge from the US Army.\n\nLater—as part of an ongoing administrative revision of Army Enlisted MOSs—MOS 91W was redesignated 68W.\n\nNotable Medal of Honor recipients who served as combat medics include Desmond Doss, Joseph G. LaPointe Jr., Thomas W. Bennett, and Gary M. Rose.\n\nAfter completion of Basic Combat Training, soldiers training for 68W10 ship to Fort Sam Houston, Texas for Advanced Individual Training (AIT). The AIT or job training may last for 16 to 68 weeks, depending what additional skill training is completed. Training includes a combination of lecture, hands-on, and practical field exercises with many skills—including starting intravenous lines—practiced on each other. The first part of the course focuses on CPR and EMT-Basic training and concludes with certification tests for both skills. Further training is on Army specific tasks.\n\nAfter assignment to a unit, \"68Ws\" may, at the request of their unit's Physician Assistant (PA), attend any number of advanced topics. Topics are generally prescribed per each unit's functional role. For example, front-line combat medic (aka \"line medic\") may learn about advanced trauma treatments including venous cutdowns, placement of chest tubes, or use of specialty hemorrhage control methods. In the case of those attached to medical units, they may learn to administer medications which result in more definitive treatment than their civilian counterparts are allowed to.\n\nUnlike civilian hospitals, field hospital units usually do not have a large number of 68W\"M6\" (LPN), and instead use the combat medic who is readily available and partially trained. Some medics opt for EMT-I or EMT-P certification or additional certifications through civilian education.\n\nMedics completing the equivalent of a bachelor's degree with required science prerequisites may apply for the Interservice Physician Assistant Program (IPAP). The intensive two-year program results in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies degree from the University of Nebraska Medical College, an officer's commission, and the opportunity to sit for civilian certification.\nHealthcare specialist also serve as the primary source for recruiting for special operations medics including \"18D\" Special Forces Medical Sergeant and Ranger Medics. Those completing the assessment course for Special Forces, 160th SOAR, or the 75th Ranger Regiment are required to complete the Special Operations Combat Medic (SOCM) course (\"W1\"). SOCM qualified medics are assigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment (Ranger Medic), 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR Flight Medic), 96th Civil Affairs Battalion (CA-Med SGT), Special Operations Support Command, and in direct support positions of these United States Army Special Operation Command (USASOC) positions. The training is an intensive 10month Special Operations Combat Medic Course/18D located at Ft.Bragg, NC to be awarded the W1 identifier. The SOCM \"68W\" is currently the most independent-duty enlisted medical personnel in the CMF 68 field.\n\nSOCM medics work independently within specific protocols; the scope of practice may be expanded during the absence of a medical officer. SOCM medics assigned to special operations units regularly attend advanced medical and military training after the SOCM course to maintain interoperability with special operations forces.\n\nSOCM (W1's) Credentials include:\n\n\nHealth Care Specialists may be awarded the Combat Medical Badge (CMB) and Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB), if they meet qualification requirements. The EFMB is awarded following successful completion of an extensive 2 week-long test of field medical skills (Many excellent medics fail this test). \n\nAR 600-8-22 Chapter 8 section 7:\n(4) On or after 18 September 2001:\n(a) Medical personnel assigned or attached to, or under operational control of any ground combat arms or combat aviation units of brigade or smaller size, who satisfactorily perform medical duties while the unit is engaged in active ground combat, provided they are personally present and under fire.\n\nThe Health Care Specialist is primarily responsible for providing emergency medical treatment, limited primary care and health protection and evacuation from a point of injury or illness. Some of the duties as a Health Care Specialist may include:\n\n\nA Combat Lifesaver (CLS) is non-medic soldier with moderate emergency medical training to provide care at the point of wounding. Combat Lifesaver skills are intended for use in combat; however, the skills may be applied to soldiers in non-combat situations. The Combat Lifesaver is instructed in various techniques to treat and stabilize injuries related to combat. To include, but not limited to, blast injury, amputation, severe bleeding, penetrating chest injuries, simple airway management, and evacuation techniques. The Combat Lifesaver doctrine was developed as an effort to increase survivability in combat environments where the combat medic may not be readily available. The Combat Lifesaver is a bridge between self aid or buddy aid, and the Combat Medic (68W). The Combat Lifesaver can augment the Combat Medic, as needed. The \"68W\" trains the Combat Lifesaver. It is a requirement that all IET (Initial Entry Training) soldiers complete the CLS (Combat Lifesaver) course, and pass the CLS exam during BCT (Basic Combat Training). Those IET Soldiers who fail to complete the course, or pass the exam are recycled to another Troop that is beginning the CLS Course.\n\n\n\nSTP 8-91W15-SM-TG SOLDIER'S MANUAL AND TRAINER'S GUIDE, MOS 91W, HEALTH CARE SPECIALIST, SKILL LEVELS 1/2/3/4/5\n\nU.S. Army AIPD Course Curriculum ISO0873\n\nU.S. Army Regulation 350-1\n\n"}

It is designed to compete with the Burger King Whopper sandwich. A similar variation called the Big Tasty, without the center \"N'\", which was first released in Saudi Arabia, is sold outside the United States in parts of Europe, South America, South Africa, The Middle East, and Taiwan.\n\nThe Big N' Tasty consists of a seasoned quarter-pound (4 oz, 113.4 g) beef meat patty with ketchup, mayonnaise, slivered onions, two dill pickle slices, leaf lettuce, and one tomato slice on a sesame seed bun.\n\nThe Big Tasty configuration is somewhat different, consisting of a third-pound (151 g) beef patty, 5-inch (12.7 cm) sesame seed bun, square-cut lettuce, two tomato slices, sliced onions, three slices of Emmental cheese, and Big Tasty sauce (which has a smoke flavor).\n\nThe Big Tasty Bacon variant also contains strips of streaky bacon. This variant is not available in the U.S., only internationally.\n\n\nThe Big N' Tasty is the latest in a series of burgers that were designed to compete against the Whopper from Burger King. The first sandwich in this line of products was the McDLT, launched in 1984. It was sold in a novel form of packaging where the meat and bottom bun was prepared separately from the lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickles, sauces, and top bun and both were then packaged into a specially designed two-sided container. The consumer was then expected to finalize preparation of it by combining the \"hot\" and \"cool\" sides just before eating. The company discontinued it between December 1990 and January 1991 to appear more environmentally friendly as it moved away from polystyrene packaging which was integral to the McDLT \"experience\".\n\nThe McDLT was eventually succeeded by the McLean Deluxe in 1991. This was a lower fat burger that included carrageenan to replace the beef fat in the patty, and was served without mayonnaise. While it tested good, it failed to catch on after the national roll-out and was discontinued in February 1996 in favor of the new Arch Deluxe, an adult oriented burger that featured a higher quality roll and a dijon mustard based mayonnaise. It was also unsuccessful and was discontinued in 1998.\n\nThe Big N' Tasty was introduced in 1997 and was originally tested in the California market, while the Big Xtra was test marketed in the Northeastern United States as the MBX; during the simultaneous testing phase, either one could be sold depending upon the test market. The Big N' Tasty was phased in nationally in 2000, displacing the Big Xtra in the United States. The national introduction was done to coincide with the opening of Disney's California Adventure. From 2002 until 2003, the Big N' Tasty was one of the flagship products for the McDonald's Dollar Menu. McDonald's removed the Big N' Tasty from the Dollar Menu on February 1, 2003, so that the Double Cheeseburger could take its place. McDonald's removed the Big N' Tasty from its menu in the United States on January 1, 2011.\n\n\nThe Big N' Tasty was first test marketed under a different name in a limited number of McDonald's restaurants in Sweden during the summer of 2003, followed by a national release during the autumn with the current name. In the UK, it launched in December 2003 with the advertising slogan \"Sorry Yanks, this one's for us\". It was phased out of all restaurants in August 2005 as part of the menu clear up that made way for the launch of the Deli Sandwiches. It was reintroduced to the UK menu as part of the limited time offer program in the Autumn of 2006. It was again introduced to the menu in the summers of 2007, 2008, and continues to do so as a promotional item, generally during winter and summer when other food events (such as the World Cup or the company's popular Monopoly promotion) are not running. The Big Tasty returned in January 2013 as part of the January food promotion. It was recently removed in Denmark and in the Netherlands for unknown reasons; it was reintroduced in the Netherlands on 2 April, 2012. It is still available at all McDonald's restaurants in Latvia, Norway, Greece and the majority of the restaurants in Sweden. The Big N' Tasty was also introduced to the Philippine market.\n\n"}
{"id": "30865215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30865215", "title": "Trauma surgery", "text": "Trauma surgery\n\nTrauma surgery is a surgical specialty that utilizes both operative and non-operative management to treat traumatic injuries, typically in an acute setting. Trauma surgeons generally complete residency training in General Surgery and often fellowship training in trauma or surgical critical care. The trauma surgeon is responsible for initially resuscitating and stabilizing and later evaluating and managing the patient. The attending trauma surgeon also leads the trauma team, which typically includes nurses and support staff as well as resident physicians in teaching hospitals.\n\n Most United States trauma surgeons practice in larger centers and complete a 1-2 year trauma surgery fellowship, which often includes a surgical critical care fellowship. They may therefore sit for the American Board of Surgery (ABS) certifying examination in Surgical Critical Care.\n\nNational surgical boards usually supervise European training programs; they also certify for subspecialization in trauma surgery. An official European trauma surgical exam exists.\n\nTraining for trauma surgeons is sometimes difficult to obtain. In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Surgeons of England is responsible for training consultants via the Definitive Surgical Trauma Skills course (DSTS) for Orthopaedics . It remains the only course of its kind in the United Kingdom. The course was originally designed to teach the military and now trains both military and civilian surgeons. In the US there is the Advanced Trauma Operative Management (ATOM) course and the Advanced Surgical Skills for Exposure in Trauma (ASSET) which provide operative trauma training to surgeons and surgeons in training. The Advanced Trauma Life Support course (ATLS) is a course that most US practitioners who take care of trauma patients are required to take (Emergency medicine, Surgery and Trauma attendings, and physician extenders as well as trainees).\n\nThe broad scope of their surgical critical care training enables the trauma surgeon to address most injuries to the neck, chest, abdomen, and extremities. In large parts of Europe trauma surgeons treat most of the musculoskeletal trauma, whereas injuries to the central nervous system are generally treated by neurosurgeons. In the US and Britain skeletal injuries are treated by trauma orthopedic surgeons. Facial injuries are often treated by maxillofacial surgeons. There is significant variation across hospitals in the degree to which other specialists, such as cardiothoracic surgeons, plastic surgeons, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists are involved in treating trauma patients.\n\nTrauma surgeons must be familiar with a large variety of general surgical, thoracic, and vascular procedures and must be able to make complex decisions, often with little time and incomplete information. Proficiency in all aspects of intensive care medicine/critical care is required. Hours are irregular and there is a considerable amount of night, weekend, and holiday work. Salaries for trauma surgeons are comparable to that of general surgeons.\n\nMost patients presenting to trauma centers have multiple injuries involving different organ systems, and so the care of such patients often requires a significant number of diagnostic studies and operative procedures. The trauma surgeon is responsible for prioritizing such procedures and for designing the overall treatment plan. This process starts as soon as the patient arrives in the emergency department and continues to the operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital floor. In most settings, patients are evaluated according to a set of predetermined protocols (triage) designed to detect and treat life-threatening conditions as soon as possible. After such conditions have been addressed (or ruled out), non-life-threatening injuries are addressed.\n\nOver the last few decades, a large number of advances in trauma and critical care have led to an increasing frequency of non-operative care for injuries to the neck, chest, and abdomen. Most injuries requiring operative treatment are musculoskeletal. For this reason, part of US trauma surgeons devote at least some of their practice to general surgery. In most American university hospitals and medical centers, a significant portion of the emergency general surgery calls are taken by trauma surgeons. The field combining trauma surgery and emergency general surgery is often called acute care surgery.\n\nDr. George E. Goodfellow is credited as the United States' first civilian trauma surgeon. He opened a medical practice in the silver boom town of Tombstone, Arizona Territory in November 1880 where he practiced for the next 11 years.\n\nOn July 2, 1881, U.S. President Garfield was shot in the abdomen by Charles J. Guiteau. Two days later, a miner was shot outside Tombstone. On July 13, 1881, Goodfellow performed the first recorded laparotomy to treat the miner's gunshot wound. The man had a perforated small intestine, large intestine and bowel. Goodfellow sutured six holes in the man's organs. Similarly, President Garfield was thought later to have a bullet possibly lodged near his liver but it could not be found. Sixteen doctors attended to Garfield and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments. Unlike the President, the miner survived.\n\nGoodfellow treated a number of notorious outlaw Cowboys in Tombstone, Arizona during the 1880s, including Curly Bill Brocius. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and his brother Assistant Deputy U.S. Marshal Morgan Earp were both seriously wounded. Goodfellow treated both men's injuries. Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp again two months later on December 28, 1881 after he was ambushed, removing of bone from his humerus and attended to Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882, when he was shot while playing a round of billiards at the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor. Morgan died of his wounds.\n\nGoodfellow once traveled to Bisbee, from Tombstone, to treat an abdominal gunshot wound. He operated on the patient stretched out on a billiard table. Goodfellow removed a .45-calibre bullet, washed out the cavity with hot water, folded the intestines back into position, stitched the wound closed with silk thread, and ordered the patient to take to a hard bed for recovery. He wrote about the operation: \"I was entirely alone having no skilled assistant of any sort, therefore was compelled to depend for aid upon willing friends who were present—these consisting mostly of hard-handed miners just from their work on account of the fight. The anesthetic was administered by a barber, lamps held, hot water brought and other assistance rendered by others.\"\n\nGoodfellow pioneered the use of sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds, washing the patient's wound and his hands with lye soap or whisky. He became America's leading authority on gunshot wounds and was widely recognized for his skill as a surgeon.\n\nBy the late 1950s, mandatory laparotomy had become the standard of care for managing patients with abdominal penetrating trauma. A laparotomy is still the standard procedure for treating abdominal gunshot wounds today.\n\n\n"}

Most commonly known as \"tostones\" (in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Jamaica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Venezuela), they are also known as \"tachinos\" or \"chatinos\" (Cuba), \"Platano frito\" (Dominican Republic), \"bananes pesées\" (Haiti), \"patacón pisao\" in Colombia and \"patacones\" (in Panama, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Peru, and Ecuador).\n\nGreen (unripe) plantains are peeled, sliced length-wise, diagonally, or width-wise, and then fried twice. The raw slices of plantains are fried for one to two minutes on each side until they are golden in color, and removed and patted to remove excess cooking oil. Afterwards, they are pounded flat with a hinged utensil made for the task, called a \"tostonera\", or less conveniently with any kitchen utensil that has a large enough flat surface, for instance between two plates. The flattened plantain slices are then fried once again until they are crisp and golden brown.\n\nIt's unclear on where this recipe originated from but most believe it Dominican Republic or Puerto Rican. Its the only place that retained the true name tostones and is closely related to other fried plantain dishes in Puerto Rico such as mofongo, arañitas (fried shredded plantains), alcapurria and tostones de pana (twice fried breadfruit).\n\nTostones are salted and eaten much like potato chips/crisps or French fries/chips. In some regions, it is customary to dip them in \"mojo\" (a garlic sauce) or ají. In Colombia they are sometimes served with hogao sauce or topped with seasoned shredded beef. In Costa Rica, they are often eaten with a paste-like dip made from black beans. In the Dominican Republic, they are commonly served with fresh lime wedges to squeeze over them and salt for sprinkling. In Guatemala on the Caribbean side they are usually served as a side when you order fish or any type of poultry. Normally sprinkled with a little salt. In some countries, they are served topped with cheese as an appetizer, or with shrimp ceviche, pulled chicken, or avocado salad. They can also be bought prepared from supermarkets. This food is found in all varieties of Caribbean cuisine. In Nicaragua they're typically served with fried cheese and sometimes with refried beans. \n\nTostones are also a staple of Latin American countries and the Caribbean, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Panama, the north coast of Honduras, and in Haiti, where they are often served with the traditional \"griot\" (fried pork) or \"picklise\" (pikliz) - a pickled hot pepper mix.\n\nThey can also be found in West African cuisine, where they are referred to as plantain crisps.\n\nIn Honduras, the term \"tostón\" may also refer to the 50-cent coin of the local currency, the lempira. This is also the case in Mexico in 50 cents of a peso.\n\n"}
{"id": "30870778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30870778", "title": "Option-adjusted spread", "text": "Option-adjusted spread\n\nOption-adjusted spread (OAS) is the yield spread which has to be added to a benchmark yield curve to discount a security's payments to match its market price, using a dynamic pricing model that accounts for embedded options. OAS is hence model-dependent. This concept can be applied to a mortgage-backed security (MBS), or another bond with embedded options, or any other interest rate derivative or option. More loosely, the OAS of a security can be interpreted as its \"expected outperformance\" versus the benchmarks, if the cash flows and the yield curve behave consistently with the valuation model.\n\nIn the context of an MBS or callable bond, the embedded option relates primarily to the borrower's right to refinance the debt at a lower interest rate. These securities must therefore pay higher yields than noncallable debt, and their values are more fairly compared by OAS than by yield. OAS is usually measured in basis points (bp, or 0.01%).\n\nFor a security whose cash flows are independent of future interest rates, OAS is essentially the same as Z-spread.\n\nIn contrast to simpler \"yield-curve spread\" measurements of bond premium using a fixed cash-flow model (I-spread or Z-spread), the OAS quantifies the yield premium using a probabilistic model that incorporates two types of volatility:\n\nDesigning such models in the first place is complicated because prepayment rates are a path-dependent and behavioural function of the stochastic interest rate. (They tend to go up as interest rates come down.) Specially calibrated Monte Carlo techniques are generally used to simulate hundreds of yield-curve scenarios for the calculation.\n\nOAS is an emerging term with fluid use across MBS finance. The definition here is based on Lakhbir Hayre's \"Mortgage-Backed Securities\" textbook. Other definitions are rough analogs:\n\nTreasury bonds (or alternate benchmarks, such as the noncallable bonds of some other borrower, or interest rate swaps) are generally not available with maturities exactly matching MBS cash flow payments, so interpolations are necessary to make the OAS calculation.\n\nFor an MBS, the word \"Option\" in Option-adjusted spread relates primarily to the right of property owners, whose mortgages back the security, to prepay the mortgage amount. Since mortgage borrowers will tend to exercise this right when it is favourable for them and unfavourable for the bond-holder, buying an MBS implicitly involves selling an option. (The presence of interest-rate caps can create further optionality.) The embedded \"option cost\" can be quantified by subtracting the OAS from the Z-spread (which ignores optionality and volatility).\n\nSince prepayments typically rise as interest rates fall and vice versa, the basic (pass-through) MBS typically has negative bond convexity (second derivative of price over yield), meaning that the price has more downside than upside as interest rates vary. The MBS-holder's exposure to borrower prepayment has several names:\n\nThis difference in convexity can also be used to explain the price differential from an MBS to a Treasury bond. However, the OAS figure is usually preferred. The discussion of the \"negative convexity\" and \"option cost\" of a bond is essentially a discussion of a single MBS feature (rate-dependent cash flows) measured in different ways.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (“Clear Lemon Fanta”) and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up.\n\nSprite advertising often makes use of the portmanteau word \"lymon\", a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".\n\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\n\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.\n\nThe brand's slogan was changed to; \"Obey Your Thirst\", and jingles containing it became urban-oriented, featuring a hip-hop theme. One of the first lyrics for the new slogan were: \"never forget yourself 'cause first things first, grab a cold, cold can, and obey your thirst.” Under the new slogan, Sprite tapped into hip-hop culture by leveraging up and coming, as well as underground rap artists including; LL Cool J, A Tribe Called Quest, KRS-One, Missy Elliott, Grand Puba, Common, Fat Joe, Nas and others in television commercials. Sprite expanded its urban connections in the late 1990s by featuring both amateur and accomplished basketball players in their advertisements. To this day, NBA players and hip-hop artists such as LeBron James, Vince Staples, and Lil Yachty frequently appear in Sprite adverts.\n\nIn 1998, one commercial poked fun at products which featured cartoon mascots in the style of a horror film. In it, the mascot for a fictitious orange juice drink called \"Sun Fizz\" comes to life, terrifying the kids and mother, and starts to chase them. This commercial is also notorious for ending on a cliffhanger which still remains unresolved to this day.\n\nIn the 1990s, one of Sprite's longest-running ad campaigns was \"Grant\nHill Drinks Sprite\" (overlapping its \"Obey Your Thirst\" campaign), in which the well-liked basketball player's abilities, and Sprite's importance in giving him his abilities, were humorously exaggerated.\n\nIn 2000, Sprite commissioned graffiti artist Temper to design limited edition art, which appeared on 100 million cans across Europe.\n\nIn 2004, Coke created Miles Thirst, a vinyl doll voiced by Reno Wilson, used in advertising to exploit the hip-hop market for soft drinks.\n\nIn 2006, a new Sprite logo, consisting of two yellow and green \"halves\" forming an \"S\" lemon/lime design, made its debut on Sprite bottles and cans. The slogan was changed from its long running \"Obey Your Thirst\" to just \"Obey\" in the United States and was outright replaced with \"Freedom From Thirst\" in many countries. This was the decade's first major shift in advertising themes.\n\nThe \"Sublymonal\" campaign was also used as part of the alternate reality game the \"Lost Experience\". This also resurrected the \"lymon\" word.\n\nSprite redesigned their label in 2009, removing the \"S\" logo.\n\nIn France in 2012, the drink was reformulated removing 30% of the sugar and replacing it with the sweetener Stevia. This led to the drink containing fewer calories. This soon spread to Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands in 2013.\n\nA further formula change happened in the UK in 2018. This formula replaces Stevia with Aspartame and Acesulfame K and has less sugar than before. In Ireland in the same year, Sprite was relaunched and the Sprite Zero was renamed Sprite. The Sprite with sugar is no longer being sold. In addition, a version of the sugar free drink with Cucumber taste was added to the range.\n\n\n"}

Examples of whole foods include whole grains, tubers, legumes, fruits, vegetables.\n\nThere is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods, in particular animal foods. The modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with \"whole foods plant-based diet\" with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods.\n\nThe earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in The Farmer, a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by F. Newman Turner, a writer and pioneering organic farmer. The magazine sponsored the establishment of the Producer Consumer Whole Food Society Ltd, with Newman Turner as president and Derek Randal as vice-president. Whole food was defined as \"mature produce of field, orchard, or garden without subtraction, addition, or alteration grown from seed without chemical dressing, in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes, and composts therefrom, and ground, raw rock and without chemical manures, sprays, or insecticides,\" having intent to connect suppliers and the growing public demand for such food.

Potatoes are peeled and sliced very thin. The slices, salted and peppered, are layered into a pan (see below), generously doused with clarified butter, and baked/fried until they form a cake. Then the cake is flipped every ten minutes until the outside is golden and crisp. At the end of the cooking period, the dish is unmoulded and forms a cake in diameter and about high. It is then cut in wedges and served immediately on a hot plate, usually accompanying roasted meats.\n\nA special double baking dish made of copper called \"la cocotte à pommes Anna\" is still manufactured in France for the cooking of this dish. It consists of upper and lower halves which fit into each other so that the whole vessel with its contents can be inverted during cooking.\n\nThe dish is generally credited with having been created during the time of Napoleon III by the chef Adolphe Dugléré, a pupil of Carême, when Dugléré was head chef at the Café Anglais, the leading Paris restaurant of the 19th century, where he reputedly named the dish for one of the \"grandes cocottes\" of the period. There is disagreement about which beauty the dish was named after: the actress \"Dame Judic\" (real name: Anna Damiens), or Anna Deslions. Some widely believe it may be named after Anna of the Hellawell clan from Ampthill. \n\n"}
