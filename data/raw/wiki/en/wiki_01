{"id": "20366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20366", "title": "Cuisine of the Midwestern United States", "text": "Cuisine of the Midwestern United States\n\nMidwestern cuisine is a regional cuisine of the American Midwest. It draws its culinary roots most significantly from the cuisines of Central, Northern and Eastern Europe, and Native North America, and is influenced by regionally and locally grown foodstuffs and cultural diversity.\n\nEveryday Midwestern home cooking generally showcases simple and hearty dishes that make use of the abundance of locally grown foods. Its culinary profiles may seem synonymous with \"American food.\" Quoted in a 2007 interview with the \"Daily Herald\", Chef Stephen Langlois, a pioneer in the Midwestern local food movement, described it: \"Think of Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey and cranberry sauce and wild rice and apple pie.\"\n\nThe Midwest's restaurants also offer a diverse mix of ethnic cuisines as well as sophisticated, contemporary techniques.\n\nSometimes called \"the breadbasket of America,\" the Midwest serves as a center for grain production, particularly wheat, corn and soybeans. Midwestern states also produce most of the country's wild rice.\n\nBeef and pork processing have always been important Midwestern industries, with a strong role in regional diets. Chicago and Kansas City were historically stockyard and processing centers of the beef trade and Cincinnati, nicknamed 'Porkopolis', was once the largest pork-producing city in the world. Iowa is the center of pork production in the U.S.\n\nFar from the oceans, Midwesterners traditionally ate little seafood, relying on local freshwater fish, such as perch and trout, supplemented by canned tuna and canned or cured salmon and herring, although modern air shipping of ocean seafood has been increasing Midwesterners' taste for ocean fish.\n\nDairy products, especially cheese, form an important group of regional ingredients, with Wisconsin known as \"America's Dairyland.\"\n\nThe upper Midwest, a prime fruit-growing region, sees the extensive use of apples, blueberries, cranberries, cherries, peaches and other cold-climate fruit in its cuisine.\n\nAs with many American regional cuisines, Midwestern cooking has been heavily influenced by immigrant groups. Throughout the northern Midwest, northern European immigrant groups predominated, so Swedish pancakes and Polish pierogi are common. Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Ohio and Illinois were destinations for many ethnic German immigrants, so pork sausages and potatoes are prevalent. In the Rust Belt, many Greeks became restaurateurs, imparting a Mediterranean influence. Native American influences show up in the uses of corn and wild rice.\n\nTraditionally, Midwestern cooks used a light hand with seasonings, preferring sage, dill, caraway, mustard and parsley to hot, bold and spicy flavors. However, with new waves of immigrants from Latin America and Asia moving into the region, these tastes are changing.\n\nThis section of the region is also headquarters for several seminal hamburger chains, including McDonald's in Chicago, Illinois (founded in California, but turned into the iconic franchise by Ray Kroc beginning with a still-standing store in Des Plaines, Illinois). The Midwest is also home to Hardee's in St. Louis, Missouri, Culver's in Sauk City, Wisconsin; Steak n Shake, founded in Normal, Illinois, and now based in Indianapolis; Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio. Diner chain Big Boy, known for burgers, is headquartered in Warren, Michigan. Both Pizza Hut (now based in Plano, Texas) and White Castle (based in Columbus, Ohio since 1933) were founded in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nBesides Pizza Hut, the Midwest is home to the other largest pizza chains in the U.S.: Little Caesars and Domino's Pizza, both based in Michigan (respectively in Detroit and Ann Arbor), and Papa John's Pizza, founded in Indiana (though its current headquarters are just outside the federally defined Midwest in Louisville, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from the chain's original home of Jeffersonville).\nA Wurst mart, sometimes spelled Wurstmart or Wurst Markt, is a variation on a fish fry found predominantly in German-American communities. Wurst marts are usually held by churches as fundraising events, where people will pay for a buffet of sausages and other side dishes. Common side dishes include mashed potatoes, gravy and sauerkraut. Wurst Mart comes from the German word \"Wurstmarkt\", meaning sausage market. Wurst marts are found mostly in small rural German-American communities in the Midwest, particularly around St. Louis.\n\nMajor urban areas in the Midwest feature distinctive cuisines very different from those of the region's rural areas, and some larger cities have world-class restaurants.\n\nPart of the greater Akron area, this small industrial city with a strong Central and Eastern European heritage has a culinary contribution called Barberton Chicken, created by Serbian immigrants, deep fried in lard, and usually accompanied by a hot rice dish, vinegar coleslaw and french fries.\n\nThe ethnic mix of the people of Chicago has led to a distinctive cuisine of restaurant foods exclusive to the area, such as Italian beef, the Maxwell Street Polish, the Chicago-style hot dog, Chicago-style pizza, chicken Vesuvio and the jibarito, as well as a large number of steakhouses.\n\nChicago also boasts many gourmet restaurants, as well as a wide variety of ethnic food stores and eateries, most notably Mexican, Polish, Italian, Greek, Indian/Pakistani and Asian, often clustered in ethnic neighborhoods. Many of these cuisines have evolved significantly in Chicago. For example, the Greek cheese dish saganaki was first flambéed at the table in Greektown.\n\nChicago is the Midwest's center of molecular gastronomy, likely due to the influence of Grant Achatz.\n\nAs a major rail hub, Chicago historically had access to a broad range of the country's foodstuffs, so even in the 19th century, Chicagoans could easily buy items like live oysters and reasonably fresh shrimp. Chicago's oldest signature dish, shrimp de Jonghe, was invented around the turn of the 20th century. Today, flights into O'Hare Airport bring Chicago fresh food from all over the world.\n\nThe Queen City is known for its namesake Cincinnati chili, a Greek-inspired meat sauce (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, and ground chilis), served over spaghetti or hot dogs. Unlike chili con carne, Cincinnati-style chili is almost never eaten by itself and is instead consumed in \"ways\" or on cheese coneys, which are a regional variation on a chili dog.\n\nGoetta, a meat-and-grain sausage or mush made from pork and oats, is unique to the Greater Cincinnati area and \"every bit as much a Queen City icon\" as Cincinnati chili. It is similar to the traditional porridge-like German peasant food stippgrutze but incorporates a higher proportion of meat-to-grain and is thicker, forming a sliceable loaf. Slices are typically fried like sausage patties and served for breakfast. More than a million pounds of goetta are served in the Cincinnati area per year.\n\nThe city has a strong German heritage and a variety of German-oriented restaurants and menu items can be found in the area. Cincinnati's Oktoberfest Zinzinnati, an annual food and music celebration held each September, is the second-largest in the world. Taste of Cincinnati, the longest running culinary arts festival in the United States, is held each year on Memorial Day weekend. In 2014, local chefs and food writers organized the first annual Cincinnati Food & Wine Classic, which drew chefs and artisan food producers from the region.\n\nThe area was once a national center for pork processing and is often nicknamed Porkopolis, with many references to that heritage in menu-item names and food-event names; pigs are a \"well-loved symbol of the city.\"\n\nCleveland's many immigrant groups and heavily blue-collar demographic have long played an important role in defining the area's cuisine. Ethnically, Italian foods as well as several Eastern European cuisines, particularly those of Poland and Hungary, have become gastronomical staples in the Greater Cleveland area. Prominent examples of these include cavatelli, rigatoni, pizza, Chicken paprikash, stuffed cabbage, pierogi, and kielbasa all of which are widely popular in and around the city. Local specialties, such as the pork-based dish City Chicken and the Polish Boy (a loaded sausage sandwich native to Cleveland), are dishes definitive of a cuisine that is based on hearty, inexpensive fare. Commercially, Hector Boiardi (aka Chef Boyardee) started his business in Cleveland's Little Italy.\n\nSweets specific to the Cleveland area include the coconut bar (similar in many respects to the Australian Lamington). Coconut bars, which are found in many Jewish bakeries in the area, are small squares of cake that have been dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut. In Italian bakeries around the Cleveland area, a variation of the Cassata cake is widely popular. This local version is unlike those typically found elsewhere being that it is made with layers of sponge cake custard and strawberries, then frosted with whipped cream. In a celebrity-chef nod to this version, Mario Batali said that the Cassata cake at Corbo's was the best in the United States.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio area is the home and birthplace of many well-known fast food chains, especially those known for hamburgers. Wendy's opened its first store in Columbus in 1969, and is now headquartered in nearby Dublin. America's oldest hamburger chain, White Castle, is based there. Besides burgers, Columbus is noted for the German Village, a neighborhood south of downtown where German cuisine such as sausages and kuchen are served. In recent years, local restaurants focused on organic, seasonal, and locally or regionally sourced food have become more prevalent, especially in the Short North area, between downtown and the OSU campus. Numerous Somali restaurants are also found in the city, particularly around Cleveland Avenue.\n\nColumbus is also the birthplace of the famed Marzetti Italian Restaurant, opened in 1896. Owner Teresa Marzetti is credited with creation of the beef-and-pasta casserole named after her brother-in-law, Johnny Marzetti. The restaurant's popular salad dressings became the foundation for the T. Marzetti Company, an international specialty foods manufacturer and distributor, headquartered in Columbus.\n\nDetroit specialties include Coney Island hot dogs, found at hundreds of unaffiliated \"Coney Island\" restaurants. Not to be confused with a chili dog, a coney is served with a ground beef sauce, chopped onions and mustard. The Coney Special has an additional ground beef topping. It is often served with French fries. Food writers Jane and Michael Stern call out Detroit as the only \"place to start\" in pinpointing \"the top Coney Islands in the land.\"\n\nDetroit also has its own style of pizza, a thick-crusted, Sicilian cuisine-influenced, rectangular type called square pizza. Other Detroit foods include zip sauce, served on steaks; the triple-decker Dinty Moore sandwich, corned beef layered with lettuce, tomato and Russian dressing; and a Chinese-American dish called \"warr shu gai\" or almond boneless chicken.\n\nThe Detroit area has many large groups of immigrants. A large Arabic-speaking population reside in and around the suburb of Dearborn, home to many Lebanese storefronts. Detroit also has a substantial number of Greek restaurateurs. Thus, numerous Mediterranean restaurants dot the region and typical foods such as gyros, hummus and falafel can be found in many run-of-the-mill grocery stores and restaurants.\n\nPolish food is also prominent in the region, including popular dishes such as pierogi, borscht, and pączki. Bakeries concentrated in the Polish enclave of Hamtramck, Michigan, within the city, are celebrated for their \"pączki,\" especially on Fat Tuesday. Hungarian food is featured in nearby eastern Toledo, Ohio with Tony Packo's Hungarian hot dog, a form of kolbász.\n\nChinese restaurants in the Detroit area serve Almond boneless chicken, a regional Chinese-American dish consisting of battered fried boneless chicken breasts served sliced on a bed of lettuce with a gravy-like chicken flavored sauce and slivered almonds.\n\nIn nearby Ann Arbor the Chipati, a tossed salad, is served inside a freshly baked pita pocket with the \"secret\" Chipati sauce on the side. The Chipati's origination is claimed by both Pizza Bob's on S. State St. and by Pizza House on Church St.\n\nIndianapolis was settled predominantly by Americans of British descent and Irish and German immigrants, so much of the city's food draws upon these influences. Much of the food is considered to be \"Classic American Cuisine\". Later immigrants included many Jews, Poles, Eastern Europeans and Italians, all of whom influenced local food. Two of the city's most distinct dishes are the pork tenderloin sandwich and sugar cream pie.\n\nA fast-growing immigrant population from places such as Mexico and India is also beginning to influence the local food. The area offers many diverse, locally owned ethnic restaurants, as well as nationally and internationally renowned restaurants. Indy is also home to many local pubs.\n\nKansas City is an important barbecue and meat-processing center with a distinctive barbecue style. The Kansas City metropolitan area has more than 100 barbecue restaurants and proclaims itself to be the \"world's barbecue capital.\" The Kansas City Barbeque Society spreads its influence across the nation through its barbecue-contest standards. The oldest continuously operating barbecue restaurant is Rosedale Barbecue near downtown Kansas City. Other popular barbecue restaurants are Gates Bar-B-Q, Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que and Arthur Bryant's. Both Arthur Bryant's and Gates Bar-B-Q sell bottled versions of their barbecue sauces in restaurants and specialty stores in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe capital and second-largest city in the state of Wisconsin, Madison has a diverse and cosmopolitan food scene. One representative is Dane County Farmers' Market, the largest producers-only farmer's market in the nation.\n\nMansfield is the home of two well-known food companies. Isaly Dairy Company (AKA Isaly's) was a chain of family-owned dairies and restaurants started by William Isaly in the early 1900s until the 1970s, famous for creating the Klondike Bar ice cream treat, popularized by the slogan \"What would you do for a Klondike Bar?\". Stewart's Restaurants is a chain of root beer stands started in Mansfield by Frank Stewart in 1924, famous for their Stewart's Fountain Classics line of premium beverages now sold worldwide.\n\nGerman immigrants settled Milwaukee. Sauerkraut, bratwurst, beer, and other traditional German favorites continue to be popular, both in homes and at Milwaukee's famous German restaurants. Milwaukee also offers a diverse selection of other ethnic restaurants.\n\nServed under various names, a favorite sandwich for Milwaukeeans and Wisconsinites consists of a brat (often butterflied to lay flat) on top of a hamburger in a kaiser roll.\n\nFrozen custard is a local favorite in the Cream City, with many competing stands throughout the area.\n\nCheese curds are another local favorite, and Wisconsinites enjoy them \"squeaky\" (cold), or fried (usually in batter).\n\nAlso known as Brew City, Milwaukee is home to many breweries and the traditional and nominal headquarters for national beer brands.\n\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul offer a diverse array of cuisines influenced by their many immigrant groups, as well as those restaurant chefs who follow the trends of larger cities. Within Minnesota, at-home fare varies broadly within various ethnic groups and their culture, historically, the overall majority of Minnesotans were of Northern European ancestry, many with farming backgrounds and many home-cooked meals still reflect this, with comfort food items such as hotdish, hearty soups and stews and meat and potatoes commonly being served. Many Minnesotans claim some Scandinavian heritage, and while iconic dishes such as lefse and lutefisk are quite commonly served at home as well as church potlucks and community get-togethers, few Twin Cities restaurants serve these items. Traditionally wild rice has been popular in Minnesota, which has been gathered in area lakes by Native Americans for centuries; In the fall, the Twin Cities share along with Green Bay, Wisconsin, the tradition of the neighborhood booyah, a cuisine and cultural event featuring a hodge-podge of ingredients in stews. One item of note: Minneapolis and Saint Paul pioneered the Jucy Lucy (or \"Juicy Lucy\"), a hamburger with a core of melted cheese.\n\nAmerican restaurants in the Twin Cities supply a wide spectrum of choices and styles that range from small diners offering simple short order grill fare and the typical sports bars and decades old supper clubs to high-end steakhouses and eateries that serve new American cuisine using locally grown ingredients. Most types of American regional cuisine can be found at restaurants in the Twin Cities. Barbecue restaurants in the area tend to feature a combination of the various regional styles of this type of cooking. In the inner cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, it's not uncommon to find a few Chicago-influenced African American barbecue restaurants. Recently Minneapolis is becoming central to the newly thriving Native American cuisine movement. It has been announced that a Native American restaurant by Sioux Chef author and educator Sean Sherman called Owanmi will be part of the Water Works, a park development project overlooking St. Anthony Falls and the Stone Arch Bridge, set to open in 2019.\n\nGermans comprise the majority of the state's ethnic heritage and one can find authentic German cuisine at the Gasthaus Bavarian Hunter in nearby Stillwater, and at the Black Forest Inn and the Gasthof zur Gemutlichkeit both found in Minneapolis. The latter restaurant is in Minneapolis' Northeast community which is also home to thriving Czech, Polish, Ukrainian and other Eastern European restaurants such as Jax Café, Kramarczuk's, Mayslack's and the former Nye's Polonaise lending this area an old world character and charm. The Twin Cities can also boast of authentic French, Irish, Italian and Russian restaurants. Spanish tapas restaurants exist, but are more trendy than homage. In the Twin Cities, pizzerias tend to be American rather than rustic Italian. Pies tend to feature thinner crusts, and are usually cut into squares (Also known as \"tavern cut\" or \"party cut\"). Rustic Italian pizzerias however, are not absent. A few do exist, and feature inventive styles of pizza.\n\nAuthentic Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants are quite popular in the Twin Cities, as there are Hispanic neighborhoods in both Saint Paul and Minneapolis. Many entrepreneurs have taken authentic Mexican cuisine into the suburbs as well. Latin American purveyors are also pioneering their home cuisines from Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru and the Spanish Speaking West Indies offering authentic churrasco and ceviche among their dining options.\n\nAsian cuisine was initially dominated by Chinese Cantonese immigrants that served Americanized offerings. In 1883 Woo Yee Sing and his younger brother, Woo Du Sing, opened the Canton Cafe in Minneapolis, the first Chinese restaurant in Minnesota. Authentic offerings began at the influential Nankin Cafe which opened in 1919, and many new Chinese immigrants soon took this cuisine throughout the Twin Cities and to the suburbs. Authentic Chinese cuisine from the provinces of Hunan and Szechaun and from Beijing, Shanghai and Taiwan are relatively new. The cuisine of Japan has been present since the opening of the area's very first Japanese restaurant, Fuji Ya in 1959. Since then, sushi and teppanyaki restaurants have also become increasingly more common. In the 1970s the Twin Cities saw a large influx of Southeast Asian immigrants from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The urban areas are now proliferated by Vietnamese phở noodle shops, banh mi and Thai curry restaurants. Since 1976 Supenn Supatanskinkasem (now Harrison) has been cooking and serving Thai food through her Minnesota State Fair Booth, Siam Café, and Sawatdee chain of Thai restaurants. Thanks to her persistence and success, others have opened Thai restaurants and there are now more than 100 establishments throughout Minnesota offering the food of Thailand.\nCambodian cuisine has also flourished given the large Hmong population familiar with it. Korean restaurants are few, as possibly their dining style and flavors have not been as adopted into the American mainstream. In the Twin Cities suburbs, Oriental buffets are popular for offering different Asian cuisines together. Restaurants offering other cuisines of Asia including those from Afghanistan, India, Nepal and the Philippines are also fairly recent additions to the Twin Cities dining scene and have been well received. Local ingredients are often integrated into Asian offerings, for example Chinese steamed walleye and Nepalese curried bison.\n\nThe Twin Cities are home to many restaurants that serve the cuisines of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. There are numerous Greek restaurants that range from fine dining to casual fast food shops that specialize in gyros. In both Minneapolis and Saint Paul, there exist long established Jewish cafes and delicatessens. Lebanese restaurants have also had a long time presence in both cities.\n\nAuthentic offerings of Arab cuisine, as well as other Middle Eastern cuisines, exist in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan area. Egyptian, Iranian (Persian), Kurdish, and Turkish restaurants can be found throughout the Twin Cities.\n\nRelated cuisines from Northeast Africa can also be found throughout the Twin Cities metropolitan area. While restaurants that serve Ethiopian dishes have been in the Twin Cities for decades, more recent immigrants from Somalia have also opened a number of restaurants in Minnesota. Somali cuisine consists of an exotic mixture of native Somali, Ethiopian, Yemeni, Indian, Persian, Turkish and Italian culinary influences.\n\nIn addition, West African immigrants have introduced their own unique cuisine in recent years. There is also a presence of Afro-Caribbean restaurants, with the famed Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis being home to two Caribbean restaurants.\n\nThe University of Minnesota has been a center for food research with inventions such as the Haralson, Honeycrisp and SweeTango apple varieties. The Minnesota State Fair offers a sampling of many cuisines each year and Twin Citians claim that the all-American Corn Dog and Pronto Pup made their very first appearances there. Much like other states in the Midwest with a significant dairy industry, deep fried cheese curds are very popular at carnivals, city festivals, baseball games, county fairs, and the aforementioned Minnesota State Fair. Additionally, many important agricultural conglomerates, including Cargill, General Mills/Pillsbury, and International Multifoods make their home in Minneapolis-Saint Paul. The Betty Crocker food brand (named after a non-existent housewife) was born there. Several national restaurant chains, such as Buca di Beppo, Famous Dave's and the now defunct Chi-Chi's started in the Twin Cities. Buffalo Wild Wings, Dairy Queen, KarmelKorn Shoppes, the former Old Country Buffet, Orange Julius and T.G.I. Friday's (a division of Carlson Companies) are also well known chains headquartered in the Twin Cities.\n\nOmaha has some unusual steakhouses such as the famous Gorat's, several of which are Sicilian in origin or adjacent to the Omaha Stockyards. Central European and Southern influences can be seen in the local popularity of carp and South 24th Street contains a multitude of Mexican restaurants. North Omaha also has its own barbecue style.\n\nOmaha is one of the places claiming to have invented the reuben sandwich, supposedly named for Reuben Kulakofsky, a grocer from the Dundee neighborhood.\n\nBronco's, Godfather's Pizza, and the Garden Cafe are among the chain restaurants that originated in Omaha.\n\nOmaha also has a thriving local pizza scene, with popular restaurants including Zio's, La Casa, Mama's and Valentino's. However, Big Fred's and Johnny Sortino's are the two that routinely vie for the title of the best pizza in town.\n\nThe cheese frenchee is also a local favorite and staple, originating from the original King's Food Host fast food restaurants. Today in Omaha, you can find them at Amigos/Kings Classic and Don & Millies fast food restaurants.\n\nThe large number of Irish and German immigrants who came to St. Louis beginning in the early nineteenth century contributed significantly to the shaping of local cuisine as confirmed by a variety of uses of beef, pork and chicken, often roasted or grilled, as well as a variety of desserts including rich cakes, stollens, fruit pies, doughnuts and cookies. Even a local form of fresh stick pretzel, called Gus's Pretzels, has been sold singly or by the bagful by street corner vendors.\n\nMayfair salad dressing was invented at a St. Louis hotel of the same name, and is richer than Caesar salad dressing. St. Louis is also known for popularizing the ice cream cone and for inventing gooey butter cake (a rich, soft-centered coffee cake) and frozen custard. Iced tea is also rumored to have been invented at the World's Fair, as well as the hot dog bun.\n\nAlthough St. Louis is typically not included on the list of major styles of barbecue in the United States, it was recognized by Kingsford as \"America’s Top Grilling City\" in its second annual list of \"Top 10 Grilling Cities.\" A staple of grilling in St. Louis is the pork steak, which is sliced from the shoulder of the pig and often basted with or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking. Other popular grilled items include crispy snoots, cut from the cheeks and nostrils of the pig; bratwurst; and Italian sausage, often referred to as \"sah-zittsa,\" a localization of its Italian name, salsiccia. Maull's is a popular brand of barbecue sauce in the St. Louis area.\n\nRestaurants on The Hill reflect the lasting influence of the early twentieth century Milanese and Sicilian immigrant community. Two unique Italian-American style dishes include \"toasted\" ravioli, which is breaded and fried, and St. Louis-style pizza, which has a crisp, thin crust and is usually made with Provel cheese instead of traditional mozzarella cheese.\n\nA Poor boy sandwich is the traditional name in St. Louis for a submarine sandwich. A St. Paul sandwich is a St. Louis sandwich, available in Chinese-American restaurants. A Slinger is a diner and late night specialty consisting of eggs, hash browns and hamburger, topped with chili, cheese and onion.\n\nIllinois is a top producer of corn and soybeans, but corn, particularly sweet corn, figures most substantially in its cuisine. Chicago-style cuisine is dominant in Northeastern Illinois, while other parts of the state mirror adjoining regions.\n\nSpringfield, Illinois, and the surrounding area are known for the horseshoe sandwich.\n\nA popular dish seen almost exclusively in Indiana is sugar cream pie, which most likely originated in the state's Amish community. Persimmon pudding is also a favorite Indiana dessert very difficult to find outside of the Hoosier State.\n\nThe pork tenderloin sandwich, a sandwich of boneless pork loin that has been pounded flat, breaded, and fried, is a popular state food; Huntington is the likely first appearance in 1913. Beef and noodles is another homespun Hoosier dish.\n\nFrog legs are traditional in old-fashioned Indiana restaurants, and brain sandwiches have a following. Fried biscuits with apple butter are served at many restaurants in southern Indiana, as are fried-brain sandwiches.\n\nIowa is the leading pork producer in the United States. This is reflected in Iowan cuisine, which includes the pork tenderloin sandwich (or simply 'pork tenderloin'), consisting of a lean section of boneless pork loin that is pounded flat, breaded, and deep fried before being served on a seeded hamburger bun with any or all of ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and dill pickle slices. In Iowa, the meat of a pork tenderloin sandwich is often far larger than the area of the bun.\n\nIowa is the center for loose-meat sandwiches, also called tavern sandwiches and appearing on many menus by each restaurant's unique name for them. They originated in the region in the Ye Olde Tavern restaurant in 1934 before being popularized by Maid-Rite in 1936, which now has franchises in other midwestern states. The Sioux City take-out restaurant \"Tastee Inn and Out\" originated in 1955 and is now one of the last extant tavern sandwich specialty single-restaurant operations in the country. In Illinois, this sandwich is also known as a \"loose hamburger sandwich\".\n\nDutch letters, pastries filled with almond paste and shaped like an 'S,' are also common in Iowa.\n\nIowa is the leader in corn production in the United States; Iowans celebrate this with numerous sweet corn feeds during the summer months.\n\nAs of November 2006, Kansas still has 29 dry counties and only 17 counties have passed liquor-by-the-drink without a food sales requirement. Today there are more than 2600 liquor and 4000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.\n\nMichigan is a large producer of asparagus, a vegetable crop widespread in Spring. Western and northern Michigan are notable in the production of apples, blueberries, and cherries. The Northwestern region of Michigan's Lower Peninsula accounts for approximately 75 percent of the U.S. crop of tart cherries, usually about 250 million pounds (11.3 Gg). A popular dish, Michigan Chicken Salad, includes cherries and often apples. Fruit salsas are also popular with cherry salsa being especially prominent. Michigan's wine and beer industries are substantial in the region. The Traverse City area is a popular destination to visit wineries and the state makes many varieties of wine, such as Rieslings, ice wines, and fruit wines. Micro-breweries continue to blossom creating a wide range of unique beers. Grand Rapids was voted Beer City USA 2013 in the Beer City USA poll, with Founders being the largest of Grand Rapids' breweries. Bell's, another large Michigan craft brewery is located further south in Kalamazoo.\n\nMichigan is the home of both Post and Kellogg, with Battle Creek being called Cereal City. Vernor's ginger ale and Faygo pop also originate in Michigan. Vernor's ginger ale is often used as a home remedy for an upset stomach.\n\nConey Islands, a type of diner originating with Greek immigrants in Detroit, are fairly common throughout the state. A Coney is many times a natural casing hot dog on a bun, topped with raw onion, mustard, and Coney sauce, a type of chili. Cheese may be added as well and variations are found throughout the state, with each city claiming theirs is the best. These diners usually also have gyros served with cucumber or honey mustard sauce, as well as hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast and dinner entrees. Most Coney Islands are open 24 hours and also a popular place to get a late or early coffee.\n\nIn Polish communities throughout the state Pączki can be found every year on Fat Tuesday (Mardi Gras) in a wide assortment of flavors including lemon, blueberry to custard. Pierogis, goulash, and Polish style sausage are common specialties in many restaurants.\n\nFish fries are common on Fridays and during Lent. Fish fries are usually set up buffet style typically consisting of items including rolls, potatoes (typically in the form of french fries and mashed), salad, coleslaw, apple sauce, deep fried fish and sometimes fried shrimp and baked fish. Fish is generally popular throughout the state due to the state's location on four of the Great Lakes. Trout, walleye, perch and catfish are common. Whitefish is a regional specialty usually offered along the coast, with smoked whitefish and whitefish dip being noteworthy.\n\nCornish immigrant miners introduced the pasty to Michigan's Upper Peninsula (U.P.) as a convenient meal to take to work in the numerous copper, silver, and nickel mines of that region. The pasty is today considered iconic of the U.P.\n\nFudge is commonly sold in tourist areas, with Mackinac Island being most famous for its fudge, traditionally chocolate, but there is a wide variety of flavors from mint to maple and may include nuts, fruit, or other candy pieces.\n\nPerhaps the most iconic Minnesota dishes are lefse and lutefisk, brought to the state by Scandinavian immigrants. Lefse and lutefisk dinners are held near Christmas and have become associated with that holiday. Lutefisk is a traditional dish of the Nordic countries made from stockfish (air-dried whitefish) and soda lye (\"lut\"). Walleye is the state fish of Minnesota and it is common to find it on restaurant menus. Its popularity with Minnesotans is such that the residents of the state consume more of the fish than does any other jurisdiction. Battered and deep-fried is a popular preparation for walleye, as is grilling. Many restaurants will feature walleye on their Friday night fish fry, which is popular at locales throughout the state.\n\nIn northern Minnesota, along the North Shore of Lake Superior, commercial fishing has been practiced for generations. Settlers were used to the cold, rugged work as many of these immigrants came directly from the coastal fishing villages of Norway. Ciscoes (also known as lake herring), lake trout, lake whitefish, and rainbow smelt are still commercially fished today. Shops along the North Shore that sell smoked local fish caught from the waters of the big lake are very popular with tourists and locals alike.\n\nMinnesota is known for its church potlucks, where hotdish is often served. Hotdish is any of a variety of casserole dishes, which are popular throughout the United States, although the term \"hotdish\" is used mainly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Hotdishes are filling comfort foods that are convenient and easy to make. \"Tater Tot Hotdish\" is a popular dish, and as Minnesota is one of the leading producers of wild rice, wild rice hotdishes are quite popular. Minnesota goulash, a combination of tomatoes, macaroni, ground beef and creamed corn is popular as well.\n\nBars are the second of the two essentials for potlucks in Minnesota. According to \"You Know You're in Minnesota When...: 101 Quintessential Places, People, Events, Customs, Lingo, and Eats of the North Star State\" by Berit Thorkelson, the bar is a Minnesota staple and a \"typical Minnesota dessert\". Thorkelson notes that bars are not included in Webster's Dictionary, and the word pronunciation of the \"ar\" is with \"a pirate-like arrr\" followed by a soft clipped s.\n\nThe immigrants that settled in the state in the 1800s were predominantly from Central and Eastern Europe (particularly Germany) and Scandinavia. They brought with them taste preferences that largely remain to this day. Those Minnesotans with this Northern European ancestry, in general, avoid hot spices in favor of earthy or aromatic spices.\n\nIn the northeastern section of the state, in the region collectively known as the Iron Range, the Mesabi Range area is known for Cornish pasties. The pasty, a meat and vegetable combination in a pastry crust, was brought to Minnesota by way of early Finnish iron miners as an easy lunch for miners working deep in the iron mines. It remains a favorite for both \"locals\" and summer tourists.\n\nA traditional Slovenian nut bread called potica served at Easter and Christmas is still very popular in northern Minnesota. It is a yeast dough rolled and stretched paper thin and spread with a mixture of ground walnuts, butter, eggs, cream, and honey or sugar. It is then rolled jellyroll fashion and baked. Traditionally it was spiraled in a round pan, but now one is more likely to find it baked as a loaf.\nThe state is a productive area for chicken, dairy and turkey farms and crops such as corn, soybeans, and sugar beets and as such, eggs and meat along with potatoes and vegetables are mainstay foods. Warm baked goods along with stews and hearty soups are a favorite in the winter given the extreme Minnesota climate. Recipes using local wild game such as bison, deer or elk are also common. Other popular dishes statewide include glorified rice, Jell-O salad, and krumkake.\n\nIn Missouri, much of the cuisine is influenced by that of the Ozarks. Barbecue, both pork and beef, is popular in both St. Louis and Kansas City, as well as in much of the southern half of the state. In the Bootheel, sweet tea is commonly available at restaurants. Missouri also leans heavily on beer and bratwurst, and St. Louis features the fried brain sandwich, the St. Paul sandwich, toasted ravioli, St. Louis-style pizza, gooey butter cake, the slinger, and many other dishes that are popular throughout the state.\n\nFishing is a popular sport throughout the state, and many fish fry events feature catfish and large-mouthed bass. The \"Missouri Rhineland\" along the valley of the Missouri River is known for its wineries.\n\nA significant population of Germans from Russia settled in Nebraska, leading to one of the state's most iconic dishes, the Runza sandwich. Large numbers of Czech immigrants, particularly to southeastern Nebraska, influenced the culture and cuisine of the area. Wilber, Nebraska is the self-designated \"Czech Capital of the U.S.A.\" and celebrates an annual \"Czech Days\" festival at which Czech food, such as kolaches, roast duck, and pork and dumplings, is served. In 2015, Nebraska resettled the largest number of refugees per capita in the United States and Lincoln, Nebraska has been a significant resettlement location for refugees since the 1980s, particularly Vietnamese-Americans. A large Vietnamese-American population in Lincoln has created Vietnamese markets—which sell ingredients, such as fresh persimmon, not typically found in Midwestern grocery store chains—and Vietnamese restaurants which sell cuisine such as pho and Bánh mì.\n\nNebraska is also known as the \"Cornhusker State\" in reference to the abundance of corn grown in the state. Corn is a common fixture of late-summer and autumnal meals in Nebraska in dishes such as corn souffle, corn chowder, cornbread, and corn on the cob. Early pioneers relied heavily on corn and cornmeal in everything from breads, (cornbread, corn mush rolls); to soups, (corn soup, Indian meal mush); and desserts, (green corn pudding, popcorn pudding, sweet corn cake).\n\nCuisine in North Dakota has been heavily influenced by both Norwegians and Germans from Russia, ethnic groups which have historically accounted for a large portion of North Dakota's population. Norwegian influences in the state include lefse, lutefisk, krumkake, and rosettes. Much of the Norwegian-influenced cuisine is also common in Minnesota and other states where Norwegians and their descendants live(d), although Norwegian influence may be the greater in North Dakota than any other state, as Norwegians played a large role in settling the area, and nearly one-third of North Dakotans claim Norwegian ancestry. Norwegian ancestry was historically more widespread throughout the northern half and eastern third of North Dakota, and therefore plays a stronger role in local cuisine in those parts of the state.\n\nGerman-Russian cuisine is primarily influenced by that of the Schwarzmeerdeutsche, or Black Sea Germans, that heavily populated south-central and southwestern North Dakota (an area known as the German-Russian Triangle), as well as areas of South Dakota. While large numbers of Wolgadeutsche, Germans from Russia who lived near the Volga River in Russia (several hundred miles away from the Black Sea), also settled in the United States, they did not settle in large numbers in the Dakotas. Popular German-Russian cuisine includes kuchen, a thin, cheesecake-like custard pastry often filled with fruit such as cherries, apricot, prunes, and sometimes cottage cheese. Fleischkuekle (or fleischkuechle) is a popular meat-filled thin flatbread that is deep-fried and served hot. Another German-Russian specialty in the area is knoephla, a dumpling soup that almost always includes potatoes, and to a lesser extent, celery.\n\nA confection popular in the state of Ohio is the local variation of a peanut butter cup known as a 'Buckeye'. Coated in chocolate, with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, in appearance the candy resembles the chestnut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the Buckeye.\n\nCincinnati-style chili is a Greek-inspired meat sauce, (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, chili powder, unsweetened dark chocolate, salt and pepper), used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs. Additionally, red beans, chopped onions, and shredded cheese are offered as extra toppings referred to as \"ways.\"\n\nA popular snack food in Ohio are Sauerkraut Balls, a meatball-sized fritter containing sauerkraut and some combination of ham, bacon, and pork. The recipe was invented in the late 1950s by two brothers, Max and Roman Gruber for their five star restaurant, Gruber's, located in Shaker Heights, Ohio. These were a derivative of the various ethnic cultures of Northeast Ohio, which includes Akron and Greater Cleveland. An annual Sauerkraut Festival is held in Waynesville, Ohio. at which sauerkraut balls, along with other sauerkraut specialities, are served.\n\nClam bakes are very popular in Northeast Ohio. The region, which was originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, was initially settled by people from Connecticut and other New England states. A typical Northeast Ohio clam bake typically includes clams, chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, and other side dishes. Unlike in New England, seaweed is not used and the clams, chicken, and sweet potatoes are all steamed together in a large pot.\n\nWisconsin is \"America's Dairyland,\" and is home to numerous frozen custard stands, particularly around Milwaukee and along the Lake Michigan corridor. The state also has a special relationship with Blue Moon ice cream, being one of the only places the flavor can be found. While the flavor's origins are not well documented, it was most likely developed by flavor chemist Bill \"Doc\" Sidon of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The state is also well known as a home to many cheesemakers. Currently, Wisconsin boasts 58 Master Cheesemakers, who are all qualified through an extensive process set by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board. The program is the only one of its kind outside of Europe. However, Wisconsin cheesemaking is even more diverse, ranging from artisans who hand-craft their product from the milk of their own dairy herds to large factories. Colby cheese was first created in Wisconsin in 1885 (named after the town it came from), and Brick cheese was first created in the state in 1877. The state has also played origin to Blue Marble Jack cheese, and is the only producer of Limburger cheese in the United States. Cheese curds can be eaten separately \"squeaky,\" or cold, as a snack, or covered in batter and fried as an appetizer, often served with ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.\n\nArguably the most universal Wisconsin dessert would be the cream puff, a type of profiterole that is a famous treat at the Wisconsin State Fair. The southeastern Wisconsin city of Racine is known for its Danish kringle, a sweet flaky pastry often served as a dessert. The capital city of Madison, Wisconsin was home to Carson Gulley, a famous local African American chef of the University of Wisconsin–Madison from the 1920s to the 1950s. He is credited with creating the famous dessert Fudge-Bottom pie and spreading its popularity.\n\nThe Friday night fish fry, often battered and fried perch or walleye, is traditional throughout Wisconsin, while in northeast Wisconsin along Lake Michigan, the Door County fish boil holds sway. The supper club is another common phenomenon of Wisconsin culinary heritage and often a destination for fish frys, which usually feature a portion of aforementioned fish, along with various sides: a fried food such as french fries and onion rings are common, along with condiments of tartar sauce and cole slaw (especially crimson slaw, a variety of cole slaw that incorporates Wisconsin's cranberries) and garnishes of parsley and lemon wedges.\n\nBesides its \"Cheesehead\" status, Wisconsin has a reputation for alcohol consumption. Common traits of \"drinking culture\" are embedded in Wisconsin traditions, from festivals and holidays to everyday life. Many large breweries were founded in Wisconsin, largely in Milwaukee, which gained the epithet \"Brew City\" before the turn of the century: Miller, Pabst, Schlitz (all from and originally based in Milwaukee) and Leinenkugel all began as local favorites before entering the national and international markets. Wisconsin has experienced a resurgence in this industry, however, with numerous microbreweries and craft beers now being created and exported. Several other favorites include Ale Asylum, Capital, Sprecher, and New Glarus, the latter being well known for the Spotted Cow Farmhouse Ale. Besides beer, Wisconsinites also drink large quantities of brandy, often mixed into the unique Badger libation, the \"brandy Old Fashioned,\" which can be sweet, sour, or press. Another though considerably more recent brandy-based cocktail is the Wisconsin Badger, derived from a mix of brandy, cranberry juice, and cherry schnapps—all very Wisconsin-inspired ingredients. Pewaukee, Wisconsin is also home to the alcoholic beverage Rumchata, described as an \"horchata\" recipe containing the primary ingredients of rum and Wisconsin cream.\n\nCooking with alcohol is also quite standard across the state. Wisconsinites commonly boil or braise their sausages (especially bratwursts) in several types of beer (most often a pilsner) with butter and onions, and \"Beer batter\" fish, typically walleye or perch, as well as cheese curds and onion rings are also common fare. Beer cheese soup is another beloved recipe, usually made from a variety of beer and a sharp cheddar or more mild colby cheese, with sausage, potatoes, and green onions. Another ubiquitous but perhaps less-mentioned recipe involving alcohol is \"Beer Butt\" or \"Beer Can\" Chicken (similar to drunken chicken), a vernacular meal involving a whole chicken slow-roasted, typically over a fire, with a can of usually amber beer directly inserted into the poultry's cavity; the result being a tender meat soaked inside with the flavors of the beer chosen.\n\n\"Booyah\" is another very common and hearty Wisconsin meal, found especially in the Northeast region of the state. The origins of this dish are disputed, but the Wisconsin origin contends that the word is a vernacular Flemish or Walloon Belgian spelling of the French word \"bouillon\", in this context meaning \"broth.\" Recipes vary but common ingredients usually involve chicken or other meats—beef, pork, or ox tail are most often used—as well as a mirepoix of vegetables, commonly onion, celery, carrots, cabbage, peas, potatoes, and rutabaga. The ingredients are all cooked together in a special kind of large, cast-iron kettle often known as a \"booyah kettle,\" over low heat for several days.\n\nWisconsin cuisine also features a large amount of sausage, or \"wurst\" (German for \"sausage\"). The state is also a major producer and consumer of summer sausage, as well as the nation's top producer and consumer of brats. Brats are typically boiled in a mix of beer, butter, and onions, served on a bratwurst bun, and topped with sauerkraut and often a spicy, brown style mustard. The city of Madison, Wisconsin, the state's capital, plays host to the annual \"World's Largest\" Brat Fest, a four-day-long festival incorporating music, recreational activities, and of course bratwursts grilled on a 65-foot-long grill. At Miller Park in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin's deep affection for sausage plays out in the Sausage Race, a mascot race involving racing sausage mascots representative of some of the most common sausages found in the state: bratwurst, kielbasa, Italian sausage, the hot dog, and chorizo. Venison sausage, Andouille sausage, and Belgian trippe are a few other common sausages found in the state, though they do not constitute a part of the Sausage Race. Miller Park is also notable for being the only U.S. stadium in which brats outsell hot dogs.\n\nSeymour, Wisconsin, claims to be the birthplace of the modern hamburger, although several other locations make similar claims. Certainly, however, the \"Butter Burger\" is a uniquely Wisconsin take on the classic American dish. Traditionally, a pad of butter is worked or \"stuffed\" into the raw hamburger patty before grilling.\n\nThese dishes, while not all exclusive to the Midwest, are typical of Midwestern foods. Although many foods are shared with other U.S. regions, they often feature uniquely Midwestern preparation styles.\n\n"}
{"id": "20829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20829", "title": "Moxie", "text": "Moxie\n\nMoxie is a brand of carbonated beverage that was among the first mass-produced soft drinks in the United States. It continues to be regionally popular today, particularly in New England. It is produced by the Moxie Beverage Company of Bedford, New Hampshire. Moxie was purchased by the Coca-Cola company in 2018.\n\nMoxie's flavor is unique, a sweet drink with a bitter aftertaste. Moxie is flavored with gentian root extract, an extremely bitter substance commonly used in herbal medicine. It originated around 1876 as a patent medicine called \"Moxie Nerve Food\".\n\nMoxie is closely associated with the state of Maine and was designated the official soft drink of Maine on May 10, 2005. Its creator, Dr. Augustin Thompson, was born in Union, Maine, but Moxie was created and first produced in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\nThe name has become the word \"moxie\" in American English, a noun meaning courage, daring, or determination.\n\nMoxie originated as a patent medicine called \"Moxie Nerve Food\", which was created around 1876 by Dr. Augustin Thompson in Lowell, Massachusetts. Thompson claimed that it contained an extract from a rare, unnamed South American plant, which is now known to be gentian root. Moxie, he claimed, was especially effective against \"paralysis, softening of the brain, nervousness, and insomnia\".\n\nThompson claimed that he named the beverage after a Lieutenant Moxie, a purported friend of his, who he claimed had discovered the plant and used it as a panacea, and the company he created continued to promulgate legendary stories about the word's origin. It likely derives from an Abenaki word that means \"dark water\" and that is found in lake and river names in Maine, where Thompson was born and raised.\n\nAfter a few years, Thompson added soda water to the formula and changed the product's name to \"Beverage Moxie Nerve Food\". By 1884 he was selling Moxie both in bottles and in bulk as a soda fountain syrup. In 1885, he received a trade mark for the term. He marketed it as \"a delicious blend of bitter and sweet, a drink to satisfy everyone's taste\". Thompson died in 1903.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in 1907 by the Moxie Nerve Food Company of New England against the Modox Company and others, alleging that they had copied the ingredients of Moxie and were using the name \"Modox\", which closely resembled \"Moxie\", and were infringing upon patents and trademarks. The suit was dismissed by the judge, who said the court could not protect the legitimate part of the plaintiff's business in this case. In a later case in New York, the Moxie Nerve Food Company won a lawsuit against Modox, which subsequently went out of business.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge was known to favor the drink, and Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams endorsed it on radio and in print. The company also marketed a beverage called \"Ted's Root Beer\" in the early sixties. Author E. B. White once claimed that \"Moxie contains gentian root, which is the path to the good life.\" Currently, one of the ingredients of Moxie is \"Gentian Root Extractives\", which may contribute to the drink's unique flavor.\n\nThe brand suffered a significant decline in sales during the 1930s.\n\nThe Catawissa Bottling Company in Catawissa, Pennsylvania, is one of six bottlers in the United States that produce Moxie. Catawissa has produced it since 1945. Polar Beverages also bottles Moxie in Worcester, Massachusetts, as does Orca Beverage in Mukilteo, Washington.\n\nSugar-free Diet Moxie was introduced in 1962, about the same time that \"Mad\" magazine began placing the Moxie logo in the background of its articles to increase public awareness of it. As a result of \"Mad\" ’s efforts, sales of the soft drink increased 10%; this led to the \"Mad About Moxie\" campaign.\n\nThe Moxie brand was purchased in 1966 by the Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta. In 2007 Monarch sold it to its current owner, Cornucopia Beverages of Bedford, New Hampshire, which is owned by the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England, a subsidiary of the Kirin Brewery Company, which is a subsidiary of Kirin Company, Limited, which is a subsidiary of Kirin Holdings Company, Limited, based in Tokyo, Japan (a member of the Mitsubishi \"keiretsu\").\n\nIn its decision to step up efforts to distribute the product, Cornucopia cited increasing requests for Moxie from fans across the country. In 2007 it launched pilot sales in Florida and in 2010 granted distribution in Florida to Florida Micro Beverage Distributors.\n\nIn 2011, Cornucopia began doing business as the Moxie Beverage Company to market Moxie and Moxie-branded products. A website, DrinkMoxie.com, was created to promote Moxie. Drink recipes using Moxie were created.\n\nDemand for Moxie has waned in recent years, although the brand persists in New England and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn August 28, 2018 Coca-Cola Co. announced it was buying Moxie from Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England Inc. for an unspecified amount.\n\nThrough extensive advertising, the term \"moxie\" has become a widely known term in American English with the meaning \"courage, daring, or spirit\", as in \"This guy's got moxie!\"\n\nIn its advertising, Moxie used \"Make Mine Moxie!\" advertising jingles, the slogan \"Just Make It Moxie for Mine\", and a \"Moxie Man\" logo. The Moxie Man had appeared on Moxie labels since the beverage was first sold. But in 2010 the Moxie Man logo was removed from labels because it was thought to be too old-fashioned. In 2011 the company's head of marketing, Ryan Savage, made the executive decision to bring the logo back in response to complaints from long-standing customers.\n\nA unique advertising tool was the Moxie Horsemobile, a modified automobile whose driver sat on a large model of a horse. The first Horsemobiles were deployed around 1918. A 1935 Rolls-Royce Moxie Horsemobile was sold for $55,000 at the May 20, 2011, Mecum Auction in Indianapolis, Indiana. Moxie at one time maintained about two dozen of them, and they appeared in parades and other public functions.\n\nThere is also a \"Moxie Energy Drink\" and a variety of \"\"Olde New England Seltzers.\"\" The energy drink is citrus-based; it lacks Moxie's gentian root tang, caramel color, and (as of 2008) its distinctive branding; similarly, the waters are simply carbonated waters with fruit flavors marketed under the Moxie brand.\n\nMoxie ice cream is seasonally available in Maine in limited quantities and is mild in flavor as compared to the soft drink.\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}
{"id": "20879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20879", "title": "Manhattan (cocktail)", "text": "Manhattan (cocktail)\n\nA Manhattan is a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters. While rye is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly used whiskeys include Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is usually stirred then strained into a cocktail glass and garnished with a Maraschino cherry. A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.\n\nThe whiskey-based Manhattan is one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough. It is closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, which uses dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, and Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan's angostura bitters.\n\nThe Manhattan is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's classic \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\".\n\nA popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the early 1870s, where it was invented by Dr. Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—\"the \"Manhattan\" cocktail\". However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely a fiction.\n\nHowever, there are prior references to various similar cocktail recipes called \"Manhattan\" and served in the Manhattan area. By one account it was invented in the 1860s by a bartender named Black at a bar on Broadway near Houston Street.\n\nThe original \"Manhattan cocktail\" was a mix of \"American Whiskey, Italian Vermouth and Angostura bitters\". During Prohibition (1920–1933) Canadian whisky was primarily used because it was available.\n\nAn early record of the cocktail can be found in William Schmidt's \"The Flowing Bowl\", published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (gomme syrup), 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, portion of whiskey and portion of vermouth.\n\nThe same cocktail appears listed as a \"Tennessee Cocktail\" in \"Shake 'em Up!\" by V. Elliott and P. Strong, copyright 1930 (p. 39): \"Two parts of whiskey, one part of Italian Vermouth and a dash of bitters poured over ice and stirred vigorously.\"\n\nOn the small North Frisian island of Föhr, the Manhattan cocktail is a standard drink at almost every cafe, restaurant, and \"get together\" of locals. The story goes, that many of the people of Föhr emigrated to Manhattan during deep sea fishing trips, took a liking to the drink, and brought it back to Föhr with them. The drink is usually mixed 1 part vermouth to 2 parts whiskey, with a dash of bitters, served ice cold, in an ice cold glass, or with ice and a cherry garnish.\n\nTraditional views insist that a Manhattan be made with American rye whiskey. However it can also be made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. The Manhattan is subject to considerable variation and innovation, and is often a way for the best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth on the surface of the drink. Angostura is the classic bitters, but orange bitters or Peychaud's Bitters may be used. Some make their own bitters and syrups, substitute comparable digestifs in place of vermouth, specialize in local or rare whiskeys, or use other exotic ingredients. A lemon peel may be used as garnish. Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color.\n\nOriginally, bitters were considered an integral part of any cocktail, as the ingredient that differentiated a cocktail from a sling. Over time, those definitions of \"cocktail\" and \"sling\" have become archaic, as \"sling\" has fallen out of general use (other than in certain drink names), and \"cocktail\" can mean any drink that resembles a martini, or simply any mixed drink.\n\nThe following are other variations on the classic Manhattan: \n\n"}
{"id": "20923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20923", "title": "Matzo", "text": "Matzo\n\nMatzo, matzah, or matza ( \"matsoh\", \"matsa\"; plural matzot; matzos of Ashkenazi Jewish dialect) is an unleavened flatbread that is part of Jewish cuisine and forms an integral element of the Passover festival, during which \"chametz\" (leaven and five grains that, per Jewish Law, can be leavened) is forbidden.\n\nAs the Torah recounts, God commanded the Jews to create this special unleavened bread. During Passover it is eaten as a flat, cracker-like bread or used in dishes as breadcrumbs and in the traditional matzo ball soup.\n\nMatzo that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzo made from flour and water. The flour may be whole grain or refined grain, but must be either wheat, spelt, barley, rye, or oat. Some Sephardic communities allow matzos containing eggs and fruit juice to be used throughout the holiday.\n\nPassover and non-Passover matzo may be soft or crisp, but only the crisp \"cracker\" type is available commercially in most locations. Soft matzo, if it were commercially available, would essentially be a kosher flour tortilla.\n\nNon-Passover matzo may be made with onion, garlic, poppy seed, etc. It can even be made from rice, maize, buckwheat and other non-traditional flours that can never be used for Passover matzo. Gluten-free matzo-lookalike made from potato starch, tapioca, and other non-traditional flour is available and may be eaten on Passover, but does not fulfill the commandment of eating matzo, even for people with celiac disease who cannot eat Passover matzo, because matzo must be made from one of the five grains (wheat, barley, oat, spelt, and rye), all of which contain gluten, except for most (but not all) types of oat matzo. Oat matzo may only be used by those who cannot have any other kind because it's not certain that oat is actually one of the five grains (it may be a mistranslation), so those who can have wheat matzo should do so.\n\n\"Matzo\" is mentioned in the Torah several times in relation to The Exodus from Egypt:\n\nThere are numerous explanations behind the symbolism of matzo. One is historical: Passover is a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The biblical narrative relates that the Israelites left Egypt in such haste they could not wait for their bread dough to rise; the bread, when baked, was matzo. (Exodus 12:39). The other reason for eating matzo is symbolic: On the one hand, matzo symbolizes redemption and freedom, but it is also \"lechem oni\", \"poor man's bread\". Thus it serves as a reminder to be humble, and to not forget what life was like in servitude. Also, leaven symbolizes corruption and pride as leaven \"puffs up\". Eating the \"bread of affliction\" is both a lesson in humility and an act that enhances the appreciation of freedom.\n\nAnother explanation is that matzo has been used to replace the pesach, or the traditional Passover offering that was made before the destruction of the Temple. During the Seder the third time the matzo is eaten it is preceded with the Sephardic rite, \"zekher l'korban pesach hane'ekhal al hasova\". This means \"remembrance of the Passover offering, eaten while full\". This last piece of the matzo eaten is called afikoman and many explain it as a symbol of salvation in the future.\n\nThe Passover Seder meal is full of symbols of salvation, the closing line, \"Next year in Jerusalem,\" but the use of matzo is the oldest symbol of salvation in the Seder.\n\nAt the Passover seder, simple matzo made of flour and water is mandatory. Sephardic tradition additionally permits the inclusion of eggs in the recipe. The flour must be ground from one of the five grains specified in Jewish law for Passover matzo: wheat, barley, spelt, rye or oat. Per Ashkenazic tradition, matzo made with wine, fruit juice, onion, garlic, etc., is not acceptable for use at any time during the Passover festival except by the elderly or unwell.\n\nMatzo dough is quickly mixed and rolled out without an autolyse step as used for leavened breads. Most forms are pricked with a fork or a similar tool to keep the finished product from puffing up, and the resulting flat piece of dough is cooked at high temperature until it develops dark spots, then set aside to cool and, if sufficiently thin, to harden to crispness. Dough is considered to begin the leavening process 18 minutes from the time it gets wet; sooner if eggs, fruit juice, or milk is added to the dough. The entire process of making matzo takes only a few minutes in efficient modern matzo bakeries.\n\nAfter baking, matzo may be ground into fine crumbs, known as matzo meal. Matzo meal can be used like flour during the week of Passover when flour can otherwise be used only to make matzo.\n\nThere are two major forms of matzo. In many western countries the most common form is the hard form of matzo which is cracker-like in appearance and taste and is used in all Ashkenazic and most Sephardic communities. Yemenites, and Iraqi Jews traditionally made a form of soft matzo which looks like Greek pita or like a tortilla. Soft matzo is made only by hand, and generally with \"shmurah\" flour.\n\nFlavored varieties of matzo are produced commercially, such as poppy seed- or onion-flavored. Oat and spelt matzo with kosher certification are produced. Oat matzo is generally suitable for those who cannot eat gluten. Whole wheat, bran and organic matzo are also available. Chocolate-covered matzo is a favorite among children, although some consider it \"enriched matzo\" and will not eat it during the Passover holiday. A quite different flat confection of chocolate and nuts that resembles matzo is sometimes called \"chocolate matzo\".\n\nMatzo contains typically 111 calories per 1-ounce/28g (USDA Nutrient Database), about the same as rye crispbread.\n\n\"Shĕmura\" (\"guarded\") matzo ( \"matsa shĕmura\") is made from grain that has been under special supervision from the time it was harvested to ensure that no fermentation has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. (\"Shĕmura\" wheat may be formed into either handmade or machine-made matzo, while non-\"shĕmura\" wheat is only used for machine-made matzo. It is possible to hand-bake matzo in \"shĕmura\" style from non-shmurah flour—this is a matter of style, it is not actually in any way \"shĕmura\"—but such matzo has rarely been produced since the introduction of machine-made matzo.)\n\nHaredi Judaism is scrupulous about the supervision of matzo and have the custom of baking their own or at least participating in some stage of the baking process. Rabbi Haim Halberstam of Sanz ruled that machine-made matzo were chametz. According to that opinion, handmade non-\"shmurah\" matzo may be used on the eighth day of Passover outside of the Holy Land. However the non-Hasidic Haredi community of Jerusalem follows the custom that machine-made matzo may be used, with preference to the use of \"shĕmurah\" flour, in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Yosef Haim Sonnenfeld, who ruled that machine-made matzo may be preferable to hand made in some cases. The commentators to the Shulhan `Aruch record that it is the custom of some of Diaspora Jewry to be scrupulous in giving Hallah from the dough used for baking \"Matzot Mitzvah\" (the Shĕmurah matzo eaten during Passover) to a Kohen child to eat.\n\n\"Egg (sometimes \"enriched\") matzo\" are matzot usually made with fruit juice, often grape or apple juice instead of water, but not necessarily with eggs themselves. There is a custom among some Ashkenazi Jews not to eat them during Passover, except for the elderly, infirm, or children, who cannot digest plain matzo; these matzot are considered to be kosher for Passover if prepared otherwise properly. The issue of whether egg matzo is allowed for Passover comes down to whether there is a difference between the various liquids that can be used. Water facilitates fermentation of grain flour, but the question is whether fruit juice, eggs, honey, oil or milk are also deemed to do so.\n\nThe \"Talmud\", Pesachim 35a, states that liquid food extracts do not cause flour to leaven the way that water does. According to this view, flour mixed with other liquids would not need to be treated with the same care as flour mixed with water. The \"Tosafot\" (commentaries) explain that such liquids only produce a leavening reaction within flour \"if\" they themselves have had water added to them and otherwise the dough they produce is completely permissible for consumption during Passover, whether or not made according to the laws applying to matzot.\n\nAs a result, Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, author of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" or \"Code of Jewish Law\" (Orach Chayim 462:4) granted blanket permission for the use of any matzo made from non-water-based dough, including egg matzo, on Passover. Many egg matzo boxes no longer include the message, \"Ashkenazi custom is that egg matzo is only allowed for children, elderly and the infirm during Passover.\" Even amongst those who consider that enriched matzot may not be \"eaten\" during Passover, it is permissible to \"retain\" it in the home.\n\nMatzo may be used whole, broken, chopped (\"matzo farfel\"), or finely ground (\"matzo meal\") to make numerous matzo-based cooked dishes. These include matzo balls, which are traditionally served in chicken soup; matzo brei, a dish of Ashkenazi origin made from matzo soaked in water, mixed with beaten egg, and fried; matzo pizza, in which the piece of matzo takes the place of pizza crust and is topped with melted cheese and sauce; and kosher for Passover cakes and cookies, which are made with matzo meal or a finer variety called \"cake meal\" that gives them a denser texture than ordinary baked foods made with flour. Hasidic Jews do not cook with matzo, believing that mixing it with water may allow leavening; this stringency is known as \"gebrochts\". However, Jews who avoid eating \"gebrochts\" will eat cooked matzo dishes on the eighth day of Passover outside the Land of Israel, as the eighth day is of rabbinic and not Torah origin.\n\nSephardim use matzo soaked in water or stock to make pies or lasagne, known as \"mina\", \"méguena\", \"mayena\" or .\n\nCommunion wafers used by the Catholic Church as well as in some Protestant traditions for the Eucharist are flat, unleavened bread. The main reason for the use of this bread is the belief, that because the last supper was described in the Synoptic Gospels as a passover meal, the unleavened matzo bread was used by Jesus when he held it up and said \"this is my body\". All Byzantine Rite churches use leavened bread for the Eucharist as this symbolizes the risen Christ.\n\nSome Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Christians use leavened bread, as in the east there is the tradition, based upon the gospel of John, that leavened bread was on the table of the Last Supper. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, unleavened bread called \"qǝddus qurban\" in Ge'ez, the liturgical language of the Eritreans and Ethiopians, is used for communion.\n\nCatholic Christians living on the Malabar coast of Kerala, India have the customary celebration of Pesaha in their homes. On the evening before Good Friday, Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they consume a sweet drink made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night, the bread is baked (steamed) immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out steam so that the bread will not rise (this custom is called \"juthante kannu kuthal\" in the Malayalam language meaning \"piercing the bread according to the custom of Jews\"). This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members.\n\nIn Israel, the Saint James Vicariate For Hebrew Speaking Catholics uses matzo as the host for the Eucharistic celebration in the Mass as a form of inculturation.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the National Jewish Welfare Board had a matzo factory (according to the American Jewish Historical Society, it was probably the Manischewitz matzo factory in New Jersey) produce matzo in the form of a giant \"V\" for \"Victory\", for shipment to military bases overseas and in the U.S., for Passover seders for Jewish military personnel. Passover in 1945 began on 1 April, when the collapse of the Axis in Europe was clearly imminent; Germany surrendered five weeks later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21023", "title": "Mormonism", "text": "Mormonism\n\nMormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 30s. After Smith was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called the Community of Christ, does not describe itself as \"Mormon\", but follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine.\n\nThe word \"Mormon\" originally derived from the Book of Mormon, a religious text published by Smith, which he said he translated from golden plates with divine assistance. The book describes itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas and their dealings with God. Based on the book's name, Smith's early followers were more widely known as \"Mormons\", and their faith \"Mormonism\". The term was initially considered pejorative, but Mormons no longer consider it so (although generally preferring other terms such as Latter-day Saint or LDS).\n\nMormonism has common beliefs with the rest of the Latter Day Saint movement, including the use of and belief in the Bible, and in other religious texts including the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. It also accepts the Pearl of Great Price as part of its scriptural canon, and has a history of teaching eternal marriage, eternal progression and polygamy (plural marriage), although the LDS Church formally abandoned the practice of plural marriage in 1890. Cultural Mormonism, a lifestyle promoted by Mormon institutions, includes cultural Mormons who identify with the culture, but not necessarily the theology.\n\nMormonism originated in the 1820s in western New York during a period of religious excitement known as the Second Great Awakening. After praying about which denomination he should join, Joseph Smith, Jr. said he received a vision in the spring of 1820. Called the \"First Vision\", Smith said God the Father instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong. During the 1820s Smith reported several angelic visitations, and was eventually told that God would use him to re-establish the true Christian church, and that the Book of Mormon would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church. Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and other early followers, began baptizing new converts in 1829. Formally organized in 1830 as the Church of Christ. Smith was seen by his followers as a modern-day prophet.\n\nJoseph Smith said the Book of Mormon was translated from writing on golden plates in a reformed Egyptian language, translated with the assistance of the Urim and Thummim and seer stones. Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the \"Urim and Thummim\". He said an angel first showed him the location of the plates in 1823, buried in a nearby hill, but he was not allowed to take the plates until 1827. Smith began dictating the text of The Book of Mormon around the fall of 1827 until the summer of 1828 when 116 pages were lost. Translation began again in April 1829 and finished in June 1829, saying that he translated it \"by the gift and power of God\". Oliver Cowdery acted as scribe for the majority of the translation. After the translation was completed, Smith said the plates were returned to the angel. During Smith's supposed possession, very few people were allowed to \"witness\" the plates.\n\nThe book described itself as a chronicle of an early Israelite diaspora, integrating with the pre-existing indigenous peoples of the Americas, written by a people called the Nephites. According to The Book of Mormon, Lehi's family left Jerusalem at the urging of God c. 600 BC, and later sailed to the Americas c. 589 BC. The Nephites are described as descendants of Nephi, the fourth son of the prophet Lehi. The Nephites are portrayed as having a belief in Christ hundreds of years before his birth. Historical accuracy and veracity of the Book of Mormon was and continues to be hotly contested. No archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America has been discovered.\n\nTo avoid confrontation with New York residents, the members moved to Kirtland, Ohio, and hoped to establish a permanent New Jerusalem or City of Zion in Jackson County, Missouri. However, they were expelled from Jackson County in 1833 and fled to other parts of Missouri in 1838. Violence between the Missourians and church members resulted in the governor of Missouri issuing an \"extermination order,\" again forcing the church to relocate. The displaced Mormons fled to Illinois, to a small town called Commerce. The church bought the town, renamed it Nauvoo, and lived with a degree of peace and prosperity for a few years. However, tensions between Mormons and non-Mormons again escalated, and in 1844 Smith was killed by a mob, precipitating a succession crisis.\n\nThe largest group of Mormons (LDS Church) accepted Brigham Young as the new prophet/leader and emigrated to what became the Utah Territory. There, the church began the open practice of plural marriage, a form of polygyny which Smith had instituted in Nauvoo. Plural marriage became the faith's most sensational characteristic during the 19th century, but vigorous opposition by the United States Congress threatened the church's existence as a legal institution. Further, polygamy was also a major cause for the opposition to Mormonism in the states of Idaho and Arizona. In the 1890 Manifesto, church president Wilford Woodruff announced the official end of plural marriage.\n\nBecause of the formal abolition of plural marriage in 1890, several smaller groups of Mormons broke with the LDS Church forming several denominations of Mormon fundamentalism. Meanwhile, the LDS Church had become a proponent of monogamy and patriotism, has extended its reach internationally by a vigorous missionary program, and has grown in size to a reported membership of over 16 million. The church is becoming a part of the American and international mainstream. However, it consciously and intentionally retains its identity as a \"peculiar people,\" believing their unique relationship with God helps save them from \"worldliness\" (non-spiritual influences).\n\nLike most other Christian groups, Mormonism teaches that there is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but unlike trinitarian faiths, the LDS Church teaches that they are separate and distinct beings with the Father and Son having perfected physical bodies and the Holy Ghost having only a body of spirit. While the three beings are physically distinct, in Mormon theology they are one in thoughts, actions, and purpose and commonly referred to collectively as the \"Godhead\". Also, Mormonism teaches that God the Father is the literal father of the spirits of all men and women, which existed prior to their mortal existence. The LDS Church also believes that a Heavenly Mother exists. Further, it is believed that all humans as children of God can become exalted, inheriting all that God has, as joint-heirs with Christ, and becoming like him as a God. Lorenzo Snow is quoted as saying \"As man now is God once was: As God now is, man may be.\"\n\nMormonism describes itself as falling within world Christianity, but as a distinct restored dispensation; it characterizes itself as the only true form of the Christian religion since the time of a Great Apostasy that began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. According to Mormons this Apostasy involved the corruption of the pure, original Christian doctrine with Greek and other philosophies, and followers dividing into different ideological groups.\nAdditionally, Mormons claim the martyrdom of the Apostles\nled to the loss of Priesthood authority to administer the Church and its ordinances.\n\nMormons believe that God re-established the early Christian Church as found in the New Testament through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, and John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and others and bestowed various Priesthood authorities on them. Mormons thus believe that their Church is the \"only true and living church\" because divine authority was restored to it through Smith. In addition, Mormons believe that Smith and his legitimate successors are modern prophets who receive revelation from God to guide the church. They maintain that other religions have a portion of the truth and are guided by the light of Christ.\n\nSmith's cosmology is laid out mostly in Smith's later revelations and sermons, but particularly the Book of Abraham, the Book of Moses, and the King Follett discourse. Mormon cosmology presents a unique view of God and the universe, and places a high importance on human agency. In Mormonism, life on earth is just a short part of an eternal existence. Mormons believe that in the beginning, all people existed as spirits or \"intelligences,\" in the presence of God. In this state, God proposed a plan of salvation whereby they could progress and \"have a privilege to advance like himself.\" The spirits were free to accept or reject this plan, and a \"third\" of them, led by Satan rejected it. The rest accepted the plan, coming to earth and receiving bodies with an understanding that they would experience sin and suffering.\n\nIn Mormonism, the central part of God's plan is the atonement of Jesus Christ. Mormons believe that one purpose of earthly life is to learn to choose good over evil. In this process, people inevitably make mistakes, becoming unworthy to return to the presence of God. Mormons believe that Jesus paid for the sins of the world and that all people can be saved through his atonement. Mormons accept Christ's atonement through faith, repentance, formal covenants or ordinances such as baptism, and consistently trying to live a Christ-like life.\n\nAccording to Mormon scripture, the Earth's creation was not \"ex nihilo\", but organized from existing matter. The Earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and there are many governing heavenly bodies, including the planet or star Kolob, which is said to be nearest the throne of God.\n\nIn Mormonism, an ordinance is a religious ritual of special significance, often involving the formation of a covenant with God. Ordinances are performed by the authority of the priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ. The term has a meaning roughly similar to that of the term \"sacrament\" in other Christian denominations.\nSaving ordinances (or ordinances viewed as necessary for salvation) include: baptism by immersion after the age of accountability (normally age 8); confirmation and reception of the gift of the Holy Ghost, performed by laying hands on the head of a newly baptized member; ordination to the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods for males; an endowment (including washing and anointing) received in temples; and marriage (or sealing) to a spouse.\n\nMormons also perform other ordinances, which include the Lord's supper (commonly called the sacrament), naming and blessing children, giving priesthood blessings and patriarchal blessings, anointing and blessing the sick, participating in prayer circles, and setting apart individuals who are called to church positions.\n\nIn Mormonism, the saving ordinances are seen as necessary for salvation, but they are not sufficient in and of themselves. For example, baptism is required for exaltation, but simply having been baptized does not guarantee any eternal reward. The baptized person is expected to be obedient to God's commandments, to repent of any sinful conduct subsequent to baptism, and to receive the other saving ordinances.\n\nBecause Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform ordinances on behalf of deceased persons. These ordinances are performed vicariously or by \"proxy\" on behalf of the dead. In accordance with their belief in each individual's \"free agency\", living or dead, Mormons believe that the deceased may accept or reject the offered ordinance in the spirit world, just as all spirits decided to accept or reject God's plan originally. In addition, these \"conditional\" ordinances on behalf of the dead are performed only when a deceased person's genealogical information has been submitted to a temple and correctly processed there before the ordinance ritual is performed. Only ordinances for salvation are performed on behalf of deceased persons. \n\nMormons believe in the Old and New Testaments, and the LDS Church uses the King James Bible as its official scriptural text of the Bible. While Mormons believe in the general accuracy of the modern day text of the Bible, they also believe that it is incomplete and that errors have been introduced. In Mormon theology, many lost truths are restored in the Book of Mormon, which Mormons hold to be divine scripture and equal in authority to the Bible.\n\nThe Mormon scriptural canon also includes a collection of revelations and writings contained in the Doctrine and Covenants which contains doctrine and prophecy and the Pearl of Great Price which addresses briefly Genesis to Exodus. These books, as well as the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, have varying degrees of acceptance as divine scripture among different denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nIn Mormonism, continuous revelation is the principle that God or his divine agents still continue to communicate to mankind. This communication can be manifest in many ways: influences of the Holy Ghost (the principal form in which this principle is manifest), visions, visitations of divine beings, and others. Joseph Smith used the example of the Lord's revelations to Moses in Deuteronomy to explain the importance of continuous revelation.\n\nMormons believe that Smith and subsequent church leaders could speak scripture \"when moved upon by the Holy Ghost.\" In addition, many Mormons believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. In Mormonism, revelation is not limited to church members. For instance, Latter Day Saints believe that the United States Constitution is a divinely inspired document.\n\nMormons are encouraged to develop a personal relationship with the Holy Ghost and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family. The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to \"personal\" revelation with respect to his or her stewardship (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve.\n\nThe important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion.\n\nMormonism categorizes itself within Christianity, and nearly all Mormons self-identify as Christian. For some who define Christianity within the doctrines of Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism, Mormonism's differences place it outside the umbrella of Christianity.\n\nSince its beginnings, the faith has proclaimed itself to be Christ's Church restored with its original authority, structure and power; maintaining that existing denominations believed in incorrect doctrines and were not acknowledged by God as his church and kingdom. Though the religion quickly gained a large following of Christian seekers, in the 1830s, many American Christians came to view the church's early doctrines and practices as politically and culturally subversive, as well as doctrinally heretical, abominable, and condemnable. This discord led to a series of sometimes-deadly conflicts between Mormons and others who saw themselves as orthodox Christians. Although such violence declined during the twentieth century, the religion's unique doctrinal views and practices still generate criticism, sometimes vehemently so. This gives rise to efforts by Mormons and opposing types of Christians to proselytize each other.\n\nMormons believe in Jesus Christ as the literal Son of God and Messiah, his crucifixion as a conclusion of a sin offering, and subsequent resurrection. However, Latter-day Saints (LDS) reject the ecumenical creeds and the definition of the Trinity. (In contrast, the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Community of Christ, is Trinitarian and monotheistic.) Mormons hold the view that the New Testament prophesied both the apostasy from the teachings of Christ and his apostles as well as the restoration of all things prior to the second coming of Christ.\n\nSome notable differences with mainstream Christianity include: A belief that Jesus began his atonement in the garden of Gethsemane and continued it to his crucifixion, rather than the orthodox belief that the crucifixion alone was the physical atonement; and an afterlife with three degrees of glory, with hell (often called spirit prison) being a temporary repository for the wicked between death and the resurrection. Additionally, Mormons do not believe in creation \"ex nihilo\", believing that matter is eternal, and creation involved God organizing existing matter.\n\nMuch of the Mormon belief system is geographically oriented around the North and South American continents. Mormons believe that the people of the Book of Mormon lived in the western hemisphere, that Christ appeared in the western hemisphere after his death and resurrection, that the true faith was restored in Upstate New York by Joseph Smith, that the Garden of Eden was located in North America, and that the New Jerusalem would be built in Missouri. For this and other reasons, including a belief by many Mormons in American exceptionalism, Molly Worthen speculates that this may be why Leo Tolstoy described Mormonism as the \"quintessential 'American religion'\".\n\nAlthough Mormons do not claim to be part of Judaism, Mormon theology claims to situate Mormonism within the context of Judaism to an extent that goes beyond what most other Christian denominations claim. The faith incorporates many Old Testament ideas into its theology, and the beliefs of Mormons sometimes parallel those of Judaism and certain elements of Jewish culture. In the earliest days of Mormonism, Joseph Smith taught that the Indigenous peoples of the Americas were members of some of the Lost Tribes of Israel. Later, he taught that Mormons were Israelites, and that they may learn of their tribal affiliation within the twelve Israelite tribes. Members of the LDS Church receive Patriarchal blessings which declare the recipient's lineage within one of the tribes of Israel. The lineage is either through true blood-line or adoption. The LDS Church teaches that if one is not a direct descendant of one of the twelve tribes, upon baptism he or she is adopted into one of the tribes. Patriarchal blessings also include personal information which is revealed through a patriarch by the power of the priesthood.\n\nThe Mormon affinity for Judaism is expressed by the many references to Judaism in the Mormon liturgy. For example, Smith named the largest Mormon settlement he founded \"Nauvoo\", which means \"to be beautiful\" in Hebrew. Brigham Young named a tributary of the Great Salt Lake the \"Jordan River\". The LDS Church created a writing scheme called the Deseret Alphabet, which was based, in part, on Hebrew. The LDS Church has a Jerusalem Center in Israel, where students focus their study on Near Eastern history, culture, language, and the Bible.\n\nThere has been some controversy involving Jewish groups who see the actions of some elements of Mormonism as offensive. In the 1990s, Jewish groups vocally opposed the LDS practice of baptism for the dead on behalf of Jewish victims of the Holocaust and Jews in general. According to LDS Church general authority Monte J. Brough, \"Mormons who baptized 380,000 Holocaust victims posthumously were motivated by love and compassion and did not understand their gesture might offend Jews ... they did not realize that what they intended as a 'Christian act of service' was 'misguided and insensitive'\". Mormons believe that when the dead are baptized through proxy, they have the option of accepting or rejecting the ordinance.\n\nSince its origins in the 19th century, Mormonism has been compared to Islam, often by detractors of one religion or the other. For instance, Joseph Smith was referred to as \"the modern mahomet\" by the \"New York Herald\", shortly after his murder in June 1844. This epithet repeated a comparison that had been made from Smith's earliest career, one that was not intended at the time to be complimentary. Comparison of the Mormon and Muslim prophets still occurs today, sometimes for derogatory or polemical reasons but also for more scholarly (and neutral) purposes. While Mormonism and Islam have many similarities, there are also significant, fundamental differences between the two religions. Mormon–Muslim relations have been historically cordial; recent years have seen increasing dialogue between adherents of the two faiths, and cooperation in charitable endeavors, especially in the Middle and Far East.\n\nIslam and Mormonism both originate in the Abrahamic traditions. Each religion sees its founder (Muhammad for Islam, and Joseph Smith for Mormonism) as being a true prophet of God, called to re-establish the truths of these ancient theological belief systems that have been altered, corrupted, or lost. In addition, both prophets received visits from an angel, leading to additional books of scripture. Both religions share a high emphasis on family life, charitable giving, chastity, abstention from alcohol, and a special reverence for, though not worship of, their founding prophet. Before the 1890 Manifesto against plural marriage, Mormonism and Islam also shared in the belief in and practice of plural marriage, a practice now held in common by Islam and various branches of Mormon fundamentalism.\n\nThe religions differ significantly in their views on God. Islam insists upon the complete oneness and uniqueness of God (Allah), while Mormonism asserts that the Godhead is made up of three distinct \"personages.\"\nMormonism sees Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and the literal Son of God, while Islam insists that the title \"Messiah\" means that Jesus (or \"Isa\") was a prophet sent to establish the true faith, not that he was the Son of God or a divine being. Despite opposition from other Christian denominations, Mormonism identifies itself as a Christian religion, the \"restoration\" of primitive Christianity. Islam does not refer to itself as \"Christian\", asserting that Jesus and all true followers of Christ's teachings were (and are) Muslims–a term that means \"submitters to God\". Islam proclaims that its prophet Muhammad was the \"seal of the prophets\", and that no further prophets would come after him. Mormons, though honoring Joseph Smith as the first prophet in modern times, see him as just one in a long line of prophets, with Jesus Christ being the premier figure of the religion.\n\nMormon theology includes three main movements. By far the largest of these is \"mainstream Mormonism\", defined by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The two broad movements outside mainstream Mormonism are Mormon fundamentalism, and liberal reformist Mormonism.\n\nMainstream Mormonism is defined by the leadership of the LDS Church which identifies itself as Christian. Members of the LDS Church consider their top leaders to be prophets and apostles, and are encouraged to accept their positions on matters of theology, while seeking confirmation of them through personal study of the Book of Mormon and the Bible. Personal prayer is encouraged as well. The LDS Church is by far the largest branch of Mormonism. It has continuously existed since the succession crisis of 1844 that split the Latter Day Saint movement after the death of founder Joseph Smith, Jr.\n\nThe LDS Church seeks to distance itself from other branches of Mormonism, particularly those that practice polygamy.\nThe church maintains a degree of orthodoxy by excommunicating or disciplining its members who take positions or engage in practices viewed as apostasy. For example, the LDS Church excommunicates members who practice polygamy or who adopt the beliefs and practices of Mormon fundamentalism.\n\nOne way Mormon fundamentalism distinguishes itself from mainstream Mormonism is through the practice of plural marriage. Fundamentalists initially broke from the LDS Church after that doctrine was discontinued around the beginning of the 20th century. Mormon fundamentalism teaches that plural marriage is a requirement for exaltation (the highest degree of salvation), which will allow them to live as gods and goddesses in the afterlife. Mainstream Mormons, by contrast, believe that a single Celestial marriage is necessary for exaltation.\n\nIn distinction with the LDS Church, Mormon fundamentalists also often believe in a number of other doctrines taught and practiced by Brigham Young in the 19th century, which the LDS Church has either abandoned, repudiated, or put in abeyance. These include:\n\nMormon fundamentalists believe that these principles were wrongly abandoned or changed by the LDS Church, in large part due to the desire of its leadership and members to assimilate into mainstream American society and avoid the persecutions and conflict that had characterized the church throughout its early years. Others believe that it was a necessity at some point for \"a restoration of all things\" to be a truly restored Church.\n\nSome LDS Church members have worked towards a more liberal reform of the church. Others have left the LDS Church and still consider themselves to be cultural Mormons. Others have formed new religions (many of them now defunct). For instance the Godbeites broke away from the LDS Church in the late 19th century, on the basis of both political and religious liberalism, and in 1985 the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ broke away from the LDS Church as an LGBT-friendly denomination, which was formally dissolved in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Basil, bay leaf, thyme, oregano, peppercorns, cloves, olives, and mushrooms may be included depending on taste preferences. Some variants include carrots and celery.

Spumone was introduced to the United States in the 1870s as Neapolitan-style ice cream. Early recipes used a variety of flavors; however, the number of three molded together was a common denominator, to resemble the Italian flag (cf. insalata tricolore). More than likely, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry became the standard for the reason that they were the most popular flavors in the United States at the time of introduction.\n\nIt is the first type of ice cream to combine three flavors. The first recorded recipe was created by head chef of the royal Prussian household Louis Ferdinand Jungius in 1839, who dedicated the recipe to Fürst Pückler.\n\nJenifer Harvey Lang, in \"Larousse Gastronomique\": \"Cosmopolitan slice.

However small the pieces, the block should be cut so that each person gets some of each kind. They are generally laid on a lace paper on an ice plate. Four or five kinds are usually put in the mold, though three sorts will do. The following will serve as a guide in arranging: First, vanilla cream, then raspberry or cherry or currant water; coffee or chocolate in the middle; the strawberry cream, with lemon or orange or pineapple water to finish. A cream ice flavored with any liqueur, a brown bread cream flavored with brandy, with a couple of bright-colored water ices, form another agreeable mixture.

In most countries, neurosurgeon training requires a minimum period of seven years after graduating from medical school.\n\nIn the United States, a neurosurgeon must generally complete four years of undergraduate education, four years of medical school, and seven years of residency (PGY-1-7). Most, but not all, residency programs have some component of basic science or clinical research. Neurosurgeons may pursue additional training in the form of a fellowship, after residency or in some cases, as a senior resident. These fellowships include pediatric neurosurgery, trauma/neurocritical care, functional and stereotactic surgery, surgical neuro-oncology, radiosurgery, neurovascular surgery, skull-base surgery, peripheral nerve and spine surgery. In the U.S., neurosurgery is considered a highly competitive specialty composed of 0.6% of all practicing physicians.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, students must gain entry into medical school. MBBS qualification (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) takes four to six years depending on the student's route. The newly qualified physician must then complete foundation training lasting two years; this is a paid training program in a hospital or clinical setting covering a range of medical specialties including surgery. Junior doctors then apply to enter the neurosurgical pathway. Unlike most other surgical specialties, it currently has its own independent training pathway which takes around eight years (ST1-8); before being able to sit for consultant exams with sufficient amounts of experience and practice behind them. Neurosurgery remains consistently amongst the most competitive medical specialties in which to obtain entry.\n\nNeurosurgery, or the premeditated incision into the head for pain relief, has been around for thousands of years, but notable advancements in neurosurgery have only come within the last hundred years.\n\nThe Incas appear to have practiced a procedure known as trepanation since the late Stone age. During the Middle Ages in Arabia from 936 to 1013 AD, Al-Zahrawi performed surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and headache.\n\nThere was not much advancement in neurosurgery until late 19th early 20th century, when electrodes were placed on the brain and superficial tumors were removed.\n\nHistory of electrodes in the brain: In 1878 Richard Canton discovered that electrical signals transmitted through an animal's brain. In 1950 Dr. Jose Delgado invented the first electrode that was implanted in an animal's brain, using it to make it run and change direction. In 1972 the cochlear implant, a neurological prosthetic that allowed deaf people to hear was marketed for commercial use. In 1998 researcher Philip Kennedy implanted the first Brain Computer Interface (BCI) into a human subject.\n\nHistory of tumor removal: In 1879 after locating it via neurological signs alone, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848-1924) performed the first successful brain tumor removal. On November 25, 1884 after English physician Alexander Hughes Bennett (1848-1901) used Macewen's technique to locate it, English surgeon Rickman Godlee (1849-1925) performed the first primary brain tumor removal, which differs from Macewen's operation in that Bennett operated on the exposed brain, whereas Macewen operated outside of the \"brain proper\" via trepanation. On March 16, 1907 Austrian surgeon Hermann Schloffer became the first to successfully remove a pituitary tumor.\n\nThe main advancements in neurosurgery came about as a result of highly crafted tools. Modern neurosurgical tools, or instruments, include chisels, curettes, dissectors, distractors, elevators, forceps, hooks, impactors, probes, suction tubes, power tools, and robots. Most of these modern tools, like chisels, elevators, forcepts, hooks, impactors, and probes, have been in medical practice for a relatively long time. The main difference of these tools, pre and post advancement in neurosurgery, were the precision in which they were crafted. These tools are crafted with edges that are within a millimeter of desired accuracy. Other tools such as hand held power saws and robots have only recently been commonly used inside of a neurological operating room. As an example, the University of Utah developed a device for computer-aided design / computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) which uses an image-guided system to define a cutting tool path for a robotic cranial drill.\n\nGeneral neurosurgery involves most neurosurgical conditions including neuro-trauma and other neuro-emergencies such as intracranial hemorrhage. Most level 1 hospitals have this kind of practice.\n\nSpecialized branches have developed to cater to special and difficult conditions. These specialized branches co-exist with general neurosurgery in more sophisticated hospitals. To practice advanced specialization within neurosurgery, additional higher fellowship training of one to two years is expected from the neurosurgeon.\nSome of these divisions of neurosurgery are:\n\nNeuropathology is a specialty within the study of pathology focused on the disease of the brain, spinal cord, and neural tissue. This includes the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. Tissue analysis comes from either surgical biopsies or post mortem autopsies. Common tissue samples include muscle fibers and nervous tissue. Common applications of neuropathology include studying samples of tissue in patients who have Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mitochondria disease, and any disorder that has neural deterioration in the brain or spinal cord.\n\nPathology has been studied ever since men have decided to cut each other open and see what is inside. But only within the last few hundred years has medicine focused on a tissue- and organ-based approach to tissue disease. In 1810, Thomas Hodgkin started to look at the damaged tissue for the cause, not the gods. This was conjoined with the emergence of microscopy and started the current understanding of how the tissue of the human body is studied.\n\nNeuroanesthesia is a field of anesthesiology which focuses on neurosurgery. Anesthesia is not used during the middle of an \"awake\" brain surgery. Awake brain surgery is where the patient is conscious for the middle of the procedure and sedated for the beginning and end. This procedure is used when the tumor does not have clear boundaries and the surgeon wants to know if they are invading on critical regions of the brain which involve functions like talking, cognition, vision, and hearing. It will also be conducted for procedures which the surgeon is trying to combat epileptic seizures.\n\nEarly forms of neuroanesthesia were found during procedures of trepanning in Southern America, like Peru. In these procedures coca leaves and datura plants were used to manage pain as the person had dull primitive tools cut open their skull. In 400 BC The physician Hippocrates made accounts of using different wines to sedate patients while trepanning. In 60 AD Dioscorides, a physician, pharmacologist, and botanist, detailed how mandrake, henbane, opium, and alcohol were used to put patients to sleep during trepanning. In 972 AD two brother surgeons, in modern-day India, used \"samohine\" to sedate a patient while removing a small tumor and awoke the patient by pouring onion and vinegar in the patients mouth. Since then, multiple cocktails have been derived in order to sedate a patient during a brain surgery. The most recent form of neuroanesthesia is the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and nitrogen. This was discovered in the 18th century by Sir Humphry Davy and brought into the operating room by Sir Astley Cooper.\n\nNeuroradiology plays a key role not only in diagnosis but also in the operative phase of neurosurgery.\n\nNeuroradiology methods are used in modern neurosurgery diagnosis and treatment. They include computer assisted imaging computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and stereotactic radiosurgery. Some neurosurgery procedures involve the use of intra-operative MRI and functional MRI.\n\nIn \"conventional open surgery\" the neurosurgeon opens the skull, creating a large opening to access the brain. Techniques involving smaller openings with the aid of microscopes and endoscopes are now being used as well. Methods that utilize small craniotomies in conjunction with high-clarity microscopic visualization of neural tissue offer excellent results. However, the open methods are still traditionally used in trauma or emergency situations.\n\n\"Microsurgery\" is utilized in many aspects of neurological surgery. Microvascular techniques are used in EC-IC bypass surgery and in restoration carotid endarterectomy. The clipping of an aneurysm is performed under microscopic vision. minimally-invasive spine surgery utilizes microscopes or endoscopes. Procedures such as microdiscectomy, laminectomy, and artificial disc replacement rely on microsurgery.\n\nUsing \"stereotaxy\" neurosurgeons can approach a minute target in the brain through a minimal opening. This is used in functional neurosurgery where electrodes are implanted or gene therapy is instituted with high level of accuracy as in the case of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. Using the combination method of open and stereotactic surgery, intraventricular hemorrhages can potentially be evacuated successfully. Conventional surgery using image guidance technologies is also becoming common and is referred to as surgical navigation, computer assisted surgery, navigated surgery, stereotactic navigation. Similar to a car or mobile Global Positioning System (GPS), image guided surgery systems, like Curve Image Guided Surgery and StealthStation, use cameras or electromagnetic fields to capture and relay the patient’s anatomy and the surgeon’s precise movements in relation to the patient, to computer monitors in the operating room. These sophisticated computerized systems are used before and during surgery to help orient the surgeon with three-dimensional images of the patient’s anatomy including the tumor.\n\nMinimally invasive \"endoscopic surgery\" is commonly utilized by neurosurgeons when appropriate. Techniques such as endoscopic endonasal surgery are used in pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, chordomas, and the repair of cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Ventricular endoscopy is used in the treatment of intraventricular bleeds, hydrocephalus, colloid cyst and neurocysticercosis. Endonasal endoscopy is at times carried out with neurosurgeons and ENT surgeons working together as a team.\n\nRepair of craniofacial disorders and disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation is done by neurosurgeons who also occasionally team up with maxillofacial and plastic surgeons. Cranioplasty for craniosynostosis is performed by pediatric neurosurgeons with or without plastic surgeons.\n\nNeurosurgeons are involved in \"stereotactic radiosurgery\" along with radiation oncologists in tumor and AVM treatment. Radiosurgical methods such as Gamma knife, Cyberknife and Novalis Radiosurgery are used as well.\n\n\"Endovascular surgical neuroradiology\" utilize endovascular image guided procedures for the treatment of aneurysms, AVMs, carotid stenosis, strokes, and spinal malformations, and vasospasms. Techniques such as angioplasty, stenting, clot retrieval, embolization, and diagnostic angiography are endovascular procedures.\n\nA common procedure performed in neurosurgery is the placement of Ventriculo-Peritoneal Shunt (VP Shunt). In pediatric practice this is often implemented in cases of congenital hydrocephalus. The most common indication for this procedure in adults is Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH).\n\n\"Neurosurgery of the spine\" covers the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal vertebral discs are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure is known as a \"discectomy\". Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the disc space to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs. \"Laminectomy\" is the removal of the Lamina portion of the vertebrae of the spine in order to make room for the compressed nerve tissue.\n\nRadiology assisted spine surgery uses minimally-invasive procedures. They include the techniques of \"vertebroplasty\" and \"kyphoplasty\" in which certain types of spinal fractures are managed.\nPotentially unstable spines will need \"spine fusions\". At present these procedures include complex instrumentation. Spine fusions could be performed as open surgery or as minimally invasive surgery. Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion is a common surgery that is performed for disc disease of cervical spine.\nHowever, each method described above may not work in all patients. Therefore, careful selection of patients for each procedure is important. It has to be noted that if there is prior permanent neural tissue damage spinal surgery may not take away the symptoms.\n\nSurgery for chronic pain is a sub branch of functional neurosurgery. Some of the techniques include implantation of deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, peripheral stimulators and pain pumps.\n\nSurgery of the peripheral nervous system is also possible, and includes the very common procedures of carpal tunnel decompression and peripheral nerve transposition. Numerous other types of nerve entrapment conditions and other problems with the peripheral nervous system are treated as well.\n\nConditions treated by neurosurgeons include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21961", "title": "Nucleon", "text": "Nucleon\n\nIn chemistry and physics, a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron, considered in its role as a component of an atomic nucleus. The number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an isotope's mass number (nucleon number).\n\nUntil the 1960s, nucleons were thought to be elementary particles, not made up of smaller parts. Now they are known to be composite particles, made of three quarks bound together by the so-called strong interaction. The interaction between two or more nucleons is called internucleon interaction or nuclear force, which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction. (Before the discovery of quarks, the term \"strong interaction\" referred to just internucleon interactions.)\n\nNucleons sit at the boundary where particle physics and nuclear physics overlap. Particle physics, particularly quantum chromodynamics, provides the fundamental equations that explain the properties of quarks and of the strong interaction. These equations explain quantitatively how quarks can bind together into protons and neutrons (and all the other hadrons). However, when multiple nucleons are assembled into an atomic nucleus (nuclide), these fundamental equations become too difficult to solve directly (see lattice QCD). Instead, nuclides are studied within nuclear physics, which studies nucleons and their interactions by approximations and models, such as the nuclear shell model. These models can successfully explain nuclide properties, as for example, whether or not a particular nuclide undergoes radioactive decay.\n\nThe proton and neutron are both fermions, hadrons and baryons. The proton carries a positive net charge and the neutron carries a zero net charge; the proton's mass is only about 0.13% less than the neutron's. Thus, they can be viewed as two states of the same nucleon, and together form an isospin doublet (). In isospin space, neutrons can be transformed into protons via SU(2) symmetries, and vice versa. These nucleons are acted upon equally by the strong interaction, which is invariant under rotation in isospin space. According to the Noether theorem, isospin is conserved with respect to the strong interaction.\n\nProtons and neutrons are best known in their role as nucleons, i.e., as the components of atomic nuclei, but they also exist as free particles. Free neutrons are unstable, with a half-life of around 13 minutes, but they are common in nature and have important applications (see neutron radiation and neutron scattering). Singular protons, not bound to other nucleons, are usually regarded as the nuclei of hydrogen atoms or ions, but in some extreme cases (cosmic rays, proton beams), they may be regarded as free protons.\n\nNeither the proton nor neutron is an elementary particle, meaning each is composed of smaller parts, namely three quarks each. A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark, while the neutron has one up quark and two down quarks. Quarks are held together by the strong force, or equivalently, by gluons, which mediate the strong force.\n\nAn up quark has electric charge  \"e\", and a down quark has charge  \"e\", so the summed electric charges of proton and neutron are +\"e\" and 0, respectively. Thus, the neutron has a charge of 0 (zero), and therefore is electrically neutral; indeed, the term \"neutron\" comes from the fact that a neutron is electrically neutral.\n\nThe mass of the proton and neutron is quite similar: The proton is or , while the neutron is or . The neutron is roughly 0.13% heavier. The similarity in mass can be explained roughly by the slight difference in masses of up quarks and down quarks composing the nucleons. However, a detailed explanation remains an unsolved problem in particle physics.\n\nThe spin of both protons and neutrons is , which means they are fermions and, like electrons (and unlike bosons), are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, a very important phenomenon in nuclear physics: protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus cannot all be in the same quantum state; instead they spread out into nuclear shells analogous to electron shells in chemistry. Also important, this spin (of proton and neutron) is the source of nuclear spin in larger nuclei. Nuclear spin is best known for its crucial role in the NMR/MRI technique for chemical and biochemical analyses.\n\nThe magnetic moment of a proton, denoted μ, is , while the magnetic moment of a neutron is μ = . These parameters are also important in NMR/MRI.\n\nA neutron in free state is an unstable particle, with a half-life around ten minutes. It undergoes decay (a type of radioactive decay) by turning into a proton while emitting an electron and an electron antineutrino. (See the Neutron article for more discussion of neutron decay.) A proton by itself is thought to be stable, or at least its lifetime is too long to measure. This is an important discussion in particle physics, (see Proton decay).\n\nInside a nucleus, on the other hand, combined protons and neutrons (nucleons) can be stable or unstable depending on the nuclide, or nuclear species. Inside some nuclides, a neutron can turn into a proton (producing other particles) as described above; the reverse can happen inside other nuclides, where a proton turns into a neutron (producing other particles) through decay, or electron capture. And inside still other nuclides, both protons and neutrons are stable and do not change form.\n\nBoth nucleons have corresponding antiparticles: the antiproton and the antineutron, which have the same mass and opposite charge as the proton and neutron respectively, and they interact in the same way. (This is generally believed to be \"exactly\" true, due to CPT symmetry. If there is a difference, it is too small to measure in all experiments to date.) In particular, antinucleons can bind into an \"antinucleus\". So far, scientists have created antideuterium and antihelium-3 nuclei.\n\n The masses of the proton and neutron are known with far greater precision in atomic mass units (u) than in MeV/c, due to the relatively poorly known value of the elementary charge. The conversion factor used is 1 u = MeV/c.\nThe masses of their antiparticles are assumed to be identical, and no experiments have refuted this to date. Current experiments show any percent difference between the masses of the proton and antiproton must be less than and the difference between the neutron and antineutron masses is on the order of MeV/c.\n\n† \"The P(939) nucleon represents the excited state of a normal proton or neutron, for example, within the nucleus of an atom. Such particles are usually stable within the nucleus, i.e. Lithium-6.\"\n\nIn the quark model with SU(2) flavour, the two nucleons are part of the ground state doublet. The proton has quark content of \"uud\", and the neutron, \"udd\". In SU(3) flavour, they are part of the ground state octet (8) of spin baryons, known as the Eightfold way. The other members of this octet are the hyperons strange isotriplet , , the and the strange isodoublet . One can extend this multiplet in SU(4) flavour (with the inclusion of the charm quark) to the ground state 20-plet, or to SU(6) flavour (with the inclusion of the top and bottom quarks) to the ground state 56-plet.\n\nThe article on isospin provides an explicit expression for the nucleon wave functions in terms of the quark flavour eigenstates.\n\nAlthough it is known that the nucleon is made from three quarks, , it is not known how to solve the equations of motion for quantum chromodynamics. Thus, the study of the low-energy properties of the nucleon are performed by means of models. The only first-principles approach available is to attempt to solve the equations of QCD numerically, using lattice QCD. This requires complicated algorithms and very powerful supercomputers. However, several analytic models also exist:\n\nThe Skyrmion models the nucleon as a topological soliton in a non-linear SU(2) pion field. The topological stability of the Skyrmion is interpreted as the conservation of baryon number, that is, the non-decay of the nucleon. The local topological winding number density is identified with the local baryon number density of the nucleon. With the pion isospin vector field oriented in the shape of a hedgehog space, the model is readily solvable, and is thus sometimes called the \"hedgehog model\". The hedgehog model is able to predict low-energy parameters, such as the nucleon mass, radius and axial coupling constant, to approximately 30% of experimental values.\n\nThe \"MIT bag model\" confines three non-interacting quarks to a spherical cavity, with the boundary condition that the quark vector current vanish on the boundary. The non-interacting treatment of the quarks is justified by appealing to the idea of asymptotic freedom, whereas the hard boundary condition is justified by quark confinement.\n\nMathematically, the model vaguely resembles that of a radar cavity, with solutions to the Dirac equation standing in for solutions to the Maxwell equations and the vanishing vector current boundary condition standing for the conducting metal walls of the radar cavity. If the radius of the bag is set to the radius of the nucleon, the bag model predicts a nucleon mass that is within 30% of the actual mass.\n\nAlthough the basic bag model does not provide a pion-mediated interaction, it describes excellently the nucleon-nucleon forces through the 6 quark bag s-channel mechanism using the P matrix. \nThe \"chiral bag model\" merges the \"MIT bag model\" and the \"Skyrmion model\". In this model, a hole is punched out of the middle of the Skyrmion, and replaced with a bag model. The boundary condition is provided by the requirement of continuity of the axial vector current across the bag boundary.\n\nVery curiously, the missing part of the topological winding number (the baryon number) of the hole punched into the Skyrmion is exactly made up by the non-zero vacuum expectation value (or spectral asymmetry) of the quark fields inside the bag. , this remarkable trade-off between topology and the spectrum of an operator does not have any grounding or explanation in the mathematical theory of Hilbert spaces and their relationship to geometry. Several other properties of the chiral bag are notable: it provides a better fit to the low energy nucleon properties, to within 5–10%, and these are almost completely independent of the chiral bag radius (as long as the radius is less than the nucleon radius). This independence of radius is referred to as the \"Cheshire Cat principle\", after the fading to a smile of Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat. It is expected that a first-principles solution of the equations of QCD will demonstrate a similar duality of quark-pion descriptions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22028", "title": "Nephrology", "text": "Nephrology\n\nNephrology (from Greek\" nephros\" \"kidney\", combined with the suffix \"-logy\", \"the study of\") is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the kidneys: the study of normal kidney function and kidney disease, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney disease, from diet and medication to renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation).\n\nNephrology also studies systemic conditions that affect the kidneys, such as diabetes and autoimmune disease; and systemic diseases that occur as a result of kidney disease, such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension. A physician who has undertaken additional training and become certified in nephrology is called a \"nephrologist\".\n\nThe term \"nephrology\" was first used in about 1960. Before then, the specialty was usually referred to as \"kidney medicine.\"\n\nNephrology concerns the diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, including electrolyte disturbances and hypertension, and the care of those requiring renal replacement therapy, including dialysis and renal transplant patients. Many diseases affecting the kidney are systemic disorders not limited to the organ itself, and may require special treatment. Examples include acquired conditions such as systemic vasculitides (e.g. ANCA vasculitis) and autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus), as well as congenital or genetic conditions such as polycystic kidney disease.\n\nPatients are referred to nephrology specialists after a urinalysis, for various reasons, such as acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, hematuria, proteinuria, kidney stones, hypertension, and disorders of acid/base or electrolytes.\n\nA nephrologist is a physician who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an expert with advanced skills. Nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in general/internal medicine, transplant medicine, immunosuppression management, intensive care medicine, clinical pharmacology, perioperative medicine, or pediatric nephrology.\n\nNephrologists may further sub-specialise in dialysis, kidney transplantation, chronic kidney disease, cancer-related kidney diseases (Onconephrology), procedural nephrology or other non-nephrology areas as described above.\n\nProcedures a nephrologist may perform include native kidney and transplant kidney biopsy, dialysis access insertion (temporary vascular access lines, tunnelled vascular access lines, peritoneal dialysis access lines), fistula management (angiographic or surgical fistulogram and plasty), and bone biopsy.\n\nNephrology training in Australia and New Zealand typically includes completion of a medical degree (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery: 4–6 years), internship (1 year), Basic Physician Training (3 years minimum), successful completion of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians written and clinical examinations, and Advanced Physician Training in Nephrology (2–3 years). The training pathway is overseen and accredited by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Increasingly, nephrologists may additionally complete of a post-graduate degree (usually a PhD) in a nephrology research interest (3–4 years). Finally, all Australian and New Zealand nephrologists participate in career-long professional and personal development through the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and other bodies such as the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology and the Transplant Society of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nephrology (or often renal medicine) is a subspecialty of general medicine. A nephrologist has completed medical school, foundation year posts (FY1 and FY2) and core medical training (CMT) and passed the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) exam before competing for a National Training Number (NTN) in renal medicine. The typical subspecialty training is five years and leads to a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) in both renal medicine and general (internal) medicine. Subspecialty trainees often interrupt their clinical training to obtain research degrees (MD/PhD).\n\nNephrology training can be accomplished through one of two routes. The first pathway is through an internal medicine pathway leading to an Internal Medicine/Nephrology specialty, and sometimes known as \"adult nephrology\". The second pathway is through Pediatrics leading to a speciality in Pediatric Nephrology. In the United States, after medical school adult nephrologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed by a two-year (or longer) fellowship in nephrology. Complementary to an adult nephrologist, a pediatric nephrologist will complete a three-year pediatric residency after medical school or a four-year Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residency. This is followed by a three-year fellowship in Pediatic Nephrology. Once training is satisfactorily completed, the physician is eligible to take the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) or American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM) nephrology examination. Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards. To be approved, the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in nephrology in order to qualify to take the board's examination. If a physician passes the examination, then he or she can become a nephrology specialist. Typically, nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an ACGME or AOA accredited fellowship in nephrology. Nearly all programs train nephrologists in continuous renal replacement therapy; fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of plasmapheresis. Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric nephrology, and internal medicine (adult) trained physicians may enter general (adult) nephrology fellowships.\n\nHistory and physical examination are central to the diagnostic workup in nephrology. The history typically includes the present illness, family history, general medical history, diet, medication use, drug use and occupation. The physical examination typically includes an assessment of volume state, blood pressure, heart, lungs, peripheral arteries, joints, abdomen and flank.\n\nExamination of the urine (urinalysis) allows a direct assessment for possible kidney problems, which may be suggested by appearance of blood in the urine (haematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), pus cells in the urine (pyuria) or cancer cells in the urine. A 24-hour urine collection can be used to quantify daily protein loss (see proteinuria), urine output, creatinine clearance or electrolyte handling by the renal tubules.\n\nBasic blood tests can be used to check the concentration of hemoglobin, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, calcium, magnesium or phosphate in the blood. All of these may be affected by kidney problems. The serum creatinine concentration can be used to estimate the function of the kidney, called the creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). More specialized tests can be ordered to discover or link certain systemic diseases to kidney failure such as infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA vasculitis), paraproteinemias (amyloidosis, multiple myeloma) and metabolic diseases (diabetes, cystinosis).\n\nStructural abnormalities of the kidneys are identified with imaging tests. These may include Medical ultrasonography/ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT), scintigraphy (nuclear medicine), angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nIn certain circumstances, less invasive testing may not provide a certain diagnosis. Where definitive diagnosis is required, a biopsy of the kidney (renal biopsy) may be performed. This typically involves the insertion, under local anaesthetic and ultrasound or CT guidance, of a core biopsy needle into the kidney to obtain a small sample of kidney tissue. The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also stage a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of prognostication. In some circumstances, kidney biopsy will also be used to monitor response to treatment and identify early relapse.\n\nTreatments in nephrology can include medications, blood products, surgical interventions (urology, vascular or surgical procedures), renal replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplantation) and plasma exchange. Kidney problems can have significant impact on quality and length of life, and so psychological support, health education and advanced care planning play key roles in nephrology.\n\nChronic kidney disease is typically managed with treatment of causative conditions (such as diabetes), avoidance of substances toxic to the kidneys (nephrotoxins like radiologic contrast and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), antihypertensives, diet and weight modification and planning for end-stage kidney failure. Impaired kidney function has systemic effects on the body. An erythropoetin stimulating agent may be required to ensure adequate production of red blood cells, activated vitamin D supplements and phosphate binders may be required to counteract the effects of kidney failure on bone metabolism, and blood volume and electrolyte disturbance may need correction.\n\nAuto-immune and inflammatory kidney disease, such as vasculitis or transplant rejection, may be treated with immunosuppression. Commonly used agents are prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus, thymoglobulin and sirolimus. Newer, so-called \"biologic drugs\" or monoclonal antibodies, are also used in these conditions and include rituximab, basiliximab and eculizumab. Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and a process known as plasma exchange can also be employed.\n\nWhen the kidneys are no longer able to sustain the demands of the body, end-stage kidney failure is said to have occurred. Without renal replacement therapy, death from kidney failure will eventually result. Dialysis is an artificial method of replacing some kidney function to prolong life. Renal transplantation replaces kidney function by inserting into the body a healthier kidney from an organ donor and inducing immunologic tolerance of that organ with immunosuppression. At present, renal transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage kidney failure although its worldwide availability is limited by lack of availability of donor organs.\n\nMost kidney conditions are chronic conditions and so long term followup with a nephrologist is usually necessary.\n\nThe world's first society of nephrology was the French 'Societe de Pathologie Renale'. Its first president was Jean Hamburger, and its first meeting was in Paris in February 1949. In 1959, Hamburger also founded the 'Société de Néphrologie', as a continuation of the older society. The UK's Renal Association was founded in 1950; the second society of nephrologists. Its first president was Arthur Osman. Its first meeting was on 30 March 1950 in London. The Società di Nefrologia Italiana was founded in 1957 and was the first national society to incorporate the phrase nephrologia (or nephrology) into its name.\n\nThe word 'nephrology' appeared for the first time in a conference, on 1–4 September 1960 at the \"Premier Congrès International de Néphrologie\" in Evian and Geneva, the first meeting of the International Society of Nephrology (ISN, International Society of Nephrology). The first day (1.9.60) was in Geneva and the next three (2–4.9.60) were in Evian, France. The early history of the ISN is described by Robinson and Richet in 2005 and the later history by Barsoum in 2011. The ISN is the largest global society representing medical professionals engaged in advancing kidney care worldwide.\n\nIn the USA, founded in 1964, the National Kidney Foundation is a national organization representing patients and professionals who treat kidney diseases. Founded in 1966, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) is the world’s largest professional society devoted to the study of kidney disease. The American Nephrology Nurses' Association (ANNA), founded in 1969, promotes excellence in and appreciation of nephrology nursing to make a positive difference for patients with kidney disease. The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP) is a non-profit, patient-centric group focused on improving the health and well-being of CKD and dialysis patients. The National Renal Administrators Association (NRAA), founded in 1977, is a national organization that represents and supports the independent and community-based dialysis providers. The American Kidney Fund directly provides financial support to patients in need, as well as participating in health education and prevention efforts. ASDIN (American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology) is the main organization of interventional nephrologists. Other organizations include CIDA, VASA etc. which deal with dialysis vascular access. The Renal Support Network (RSN) is a nonprofit, patient-focused, patient-run organization that provides non-medical services to those affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the UK National Kidney Federation and British Kidney Patient Association (BKPA) represents patients, and the Renal Association represents renal physicians and works closely with the National Service Framework for kidney disease.\n\n"}
{"id": "22048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22048", "title": "Cuisine of New England", "text": "Cuisine of New England\n\nNew England cuisine is an American cuisine which originated in the New England region of the United States, and traces its roots to English cuisine. It is characterized by extensive use of seafood and dairy products, which results from its historical reliance on its seaports and fishing industry, as well as extensive dairy farming in inland regions. Many of New England's earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England, where baking foods was more common than frying, such as pies, beans, and turkey, as was the tradition elsewhere. Two prominent characteristic foodstuffs native to New England are maple syrup and cranberries. The traditional standard starch is potato, though rice has a somewhat increased popularity in modern cooking. New England cuisine is known for limited use of spices aside from ground black pepper, although parsley and sage are common, with a few Caribbean additions such as nutmeg. Use of cream is common, due to the reliance on dairy. The favored cooking techniques are stewing, steaming, and baking.\n\nIn 1620, the Pilgrims survived their first winter in Plymouth Rock, Massachusetts with the help of Native Americans. The Wampanoag taught the newly arrived Pilgrims how to plant and fertilize the native maize plant, which the settlers called \"Indian corn\". Maize could be steamed, roasted, or turned into cornmeal. Cornmeal mush served with milk and butter was eaten hot or cold and became a staple of the early American diet. Early Americans adapted traditional English recipes by using this cornmeal as a substitute for hearth cakes. Johnny cakes and various puddings made with maize became part of the traditional American cuisine.\n\nOther Native American foods and cooking methods were adopted by early immigrants to New England , such as oysters, succotash, and New England clam bakes, as were many staples of their diet, such as the nuts of the black walnut tree, the nuts of the shagbark hickory, popcorn, blueberries, blackberries, and beach plums. These augmented more traditional English-style ingredients. In England during this period, carrying weapons (especially guns) was forbidden to any but the upper classes. Upon reaching the New World, these Englishmen found themselves in a land where they could feast on venison from the white tailed deer and the Eastern moose and shoot pigeons for their meat, some of which were likely featured at the first Thanksgiving feast in 1621.\n\nMany of New England's earliest Puritan settlers were from eastern England and also brought with them traditions of dairy products and baking pies and other foods common in England. Baked beans, apple pies, baked or roast turkey, pease porridge, and steamed puddings became common Yankee dishes; some are now common nationally during Thanksgiving dinners. Other foods which they would have prized included roast duck and roast goose, lamb, and hams, and all of these were brought to the New World as farmyard stock as soon as the colonies began to prosper.\nMolasses and rum were common in New England cuisine, due to New England's involvement in the Triangle Trade in the 18th century. Molasses from the Caribbean and honey were staple sweeteners for all but the upper class well into the 19th century. Some of the finest rum distilleries were located in New England prior to Prohibition.\n\nMany herbs were uncommon, particularly Mediterranean herbs, which are not hardy in much of New England away from the coast. As a result, most savory New England dishes do not have much strong seasoning, aside from salt and ground black pepper, nor are there many particularly spicy staple items. Other dishes meant as desserts often contain ingredients such as nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and ground ginger which are a legacy of trade with the Caribbean Sea that began in the 17th Century and lasted well into the 19th.\n\nEven today, traditional English cuisine remains a strong part of New England's identity. Some of its plates are now enjoyed by the entire United States, including clam chowder, baked beans, and homemade ice cream. In the past two centuries, New England cooking was strongly influenced and transformed by Irish Americans, Portuguese Americans, and Italian Americans.\n\nThe oldest operating restaurant in the United States is the Union Oyster House (1826) located in Boston.\n\nConnecticut is known for its apizza (particularly the white clam pie), shad and shadbakes, grinders (including the state-based Subway chain), and New Haven's claim as the birthplace of the hamburger sandwich at Louis' Lunch in 1900. Italian-inspired cuisine is dominant in the New Haven area, while southeastern Connecticut relies heavily on the fishing industry. Irish American influences are common in the interior portions of the state, including the Hartford area. Hasty pudding is sometimes found in rural communities, particularly around Thanksgiving.\n\nMaine is known for its lobster. Relatively inexpensive lobster rolls—lobster meat mixed with mayonnaise and other ingredients, served in a grilled hot dog roll—are often available in the summer, particularly on the coast. Northern Maine produces potato crops, second only to Idaho in the United States. Moxie was America's first mass-produced soft drink and is the official state soft drink. It is known for its strong aftertaste and is found throughout New England. Wax-wrapped salt water taffy is a popular item sold in tourist areas, although it is originally from New Jersey. Wild blueberries are a common ingredient or garnish, and blueberry pie is the official state dessert (when made with wild Maine blueberries). Red snappers are considered the most popular type of hot dog in Maine, natural casing frankfurters colored bright red. The whoopie pie, which is also a staple in the Philadelphia/Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, is the official state treat. Finally, the Italian sandwich is popular in Portland and southern Maine. Portland restaurant Amato's claims to have invented the Italian sandwich in 1902—specifically, a submarine sandwich made with ham, cheese, tomato, raw peppers, and pickles, served with or without oil, salt, and pepper. The city of Portland, Maine is known for its numerous nationally renowned restaurants; it was ranked as Bon Appétit magazine's \"America's Foodiest Small Town\" in 2009.\nCoastal Massachusetts is known for its clams, haddock, and cranberries, and previously cod. Boston is known for, baked beans (hence the nickname \"Beantown\"), bulkie rolls, and various pastries. Hot roast beef sandwiches are popular in Boston's surrounding area, served with a sweet barbecue sauce and usually on an onion roll. The North Shore area is locally known for its roast beef establishments, which slice tender roast beef extremely thin. The North Shore is also known for steak tips (marinated cubes of sirloin), a common menu item at pizza establishments and backyard cookouts. The South Shore area maintains a following for bar pizza, with many popular restaurants serving these crisp, thin, often heavily topped creations. Apples are grown commercially throughout the Commonwealth. Common plant foods in Massachusetts are similar to those of interior northern New England, because of the landlocked, hilly terrain, including potatoes, maple syrup, and wild blueberries. Dairy production is also prominent in this central and western area. Cuisine in western Massachusetts had similar immigrant influences as the coastal regions, though historically strong Eastern European populations instilled kielbasa and pierogi as common dishes.\n\nSouthern New Hampshire cuisine is similar to that of the Boston area, featuring fish, shellfish, and local apples. As with Maine and Vermont, French-Canadian dishes are popular, including tourtière, which is traditionally served on Christmas Eve, and poutine. Corn chowder is also common, which is similar to clam chowder but with corn and bacon replacing the clams. Portsmouth is known for its orange cake.\n\nRhode Island and bordering Bristol County, Massachusetts are known for Rhode Island clam chowder (clear chowder), quahogs (hard clams), johnny cakes, coffee milk, celery salt, milkshakes known as \"cabinets\" (called \"frappes\" elsewhere in New England), grinders, pizza strips, clam cakes, the chow mein sandwich, and Del's Frozen Lemonade. Another food item popular in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts is called a \"hot wiener\" or \"New York System wiener,\" although it is unknown in New York (including Coney Island). Italian cooking is long established in the region. In Rhode Island and other parts of New England with a large Portuguese American population, Portuguese foods are common, including linguiça, chouriço, caldo verde, malasadas, and Portuguese sweet bread.\n\nVermont produces Cheddar cheese and other dairy products. It is known in and outside of New England for its maple syrup. Maple syrup is used as an ingredient in some Vermont dishes, including baked beans. Rhubarb pie is a common dessert and has been combined with strawberries in late spring.\n\nNew England also has its own food language. Hot and cold sandwiches in elongated rolls are called subs or grinders whereas in New York City they are called heroes, and in Philadelphia they are called hoagies. Sub is short for submarine sandwich, for which Boston, Massachusetts is one of three main claimants for inventing. In Maine, the Italian sandwich—a variation specifically made up of ham or salami, cheese, peppers, pickles, tomatoes and optional oil—is popular, though usually kept distinct from other subs.\n\nNew England hot dog rolls are split on top instead of on the side, and have a more rectangular shape. While smaller than common hot dog rolls, New England hot dog rolls have a larger soft surface area which allows for buttering and toasting, which are also commonly used for convenient serving of seafood like lobster or fried clams. Regional bread makers often differentiate between these and the more traditional-style American hot dog rolls by referring to the New England variation as \"Frankfurt Rolls\" on packaging, with both commonly available next to each other on store shelves (though when purchasing a cooked hot dog or seafood \"roll\" from a restaurant or food stand, the Frankfurt style is almost exclusively used).\n\nLike many of its sister cities of the East Coast, Boston shares a love of a sandwich that is made up of a long soft roll and filled with grilled sweet peppers, sweet onion, a little olive oil, and Italian-style pork sausage, called a sausage and pepper sandwich; it is a nod to the Italian immigrants who settled in Boston a century ago, invented it as a quick snack, and now is part of the fabric of local cuisine. It is only served in the spring and summer and is a staple at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team.\n\nNew England has many local lagers and ales. Notable examples include Samuel Adams of the Boston Beer Company in Boston (even though the recipe for the beer does not come from New England); Sea Dog Brewing Company of Bangor; Shipyard Brewing Company of Portland; Smuttynose Brewing Company of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Vermont-based Woodchuck Draft Cider is a popular alcoholic cider. New England has also played a major role in the craft beer revolution, with Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont having notable breweries such as Treehouse Brewing Company, Trillium Brewing Company, The Alchemist Brewery, Rock Art Brewery, Long Trail Brewing Company, Kent Falls Brewing Company and Two Roads Brewing Company. \n\nMuch of the pizza in New England is Greek pizza, owing to the strong presence of Greek immigrants and Greek Americans in the food service industry in New England. Greek pizza (as understood in New England) is typified by its chewy, bready crust similar to focaccia, which is baked in shallow, round metal pan liberally coated with olive oil. Greek-style pizzerias in New England are often found under the name \"House of Pizza\". Many such pizzerias also serve submarine sandwiches (known as \"grinders\" in the local dialect), commonly including a local variation on the steak sandwich known as a \"steak bomb\", which includes thin sliced steak, Italian-style cold cuts such as pepperoni or salami, cheese, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22158", "title": "Nuclear proliferation", "text": "Nuclear proliferation\n\nNuclear proliferation is the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information to nations not recognized as \"Nuclear Weapon States\" by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), commonly known as the Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT. Proliferation has been opposed by many nations with and without nuclear weapons, as governments fear that more countries with nuclear weapons will increase the possibility of nuclear warfare (up to and including the so-called \"countervalue\" targeting of civilians with nuclear weapons), de-stabilize international or regional relations, or infringe upon the national sovereignty of states.\n\nFour countries besides the five recognized Nuclear Weapons States have acquired, or are presumed to have acquired, nuclear weapons: India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. None of these four is a party to the NPT, although North Korea acceded to the NPT in 1985, then withdrew in 2003 and conducted announced nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017. One critique of the NPT is that the treaty is discriminatory in the sense that only those countries that tested nuclear weapons before 1968 are recognized as nuclear weapon states while all other states are treated as non-nuclear-weapon states who can only join the treaty if they forswear nuclear weapons.\n\nResearch into the development of nuclear weapons was initially undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States was the first and is the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. After surrendering to end the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved in any nuclear weapon research. In August 1949, the USSR tested a nuclear weapon, becoming the second country to detonate a nuclear bomb. The United Kingdom first tested a nuclear weapon in October 1952. France first tested a nuclear weapon in 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated a nuclear weapon in 1964. India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974, which prompted Pakistan to develop its own nuclear program and, when India conducted a second series of nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan followed with a series of tests of its own. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.\n\nEarly efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation involved intense government secrecy, the wartime acquisition of known uranium stores (the Combined Development Trust), and at times even outright sabotage—such as the bombing of a heavy-water facility thought to be used for a German nuclear program. These efforts began immediately after the discovery of nuclear fission and its military potential. None of these efforts were explicitly public, because the weapon developments themselves were kept secret until the bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nEarnest international efforts to promote nuclear non-proliferation began soon after World War II, when the Truman Administration proposed the Baruch Plan of 1946, named after Bernard Baruch, America's first representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The Baruch Plan, which drew heavily from the Acheson–Lilienthal Report of 1946, proposed the verifiable dismantlement and destruction of the U.S. nuclear arsenal (which, at that time, was the only nuclear arsenal in the world) after all governments had cooperated successfully to accomplish two things: (1) the establishment of an \"international atomic development authority,\" which would actually own and control all military-applicable nuclear materials and activities, and (2) the creation of a system of automatic sanctions, which not even the U.N. Security Council could veto, and which would proportionately punish states attempting to acquire the capability to make nuclear weapons or fissile material.\n\nBaruch's plea for the destruction of nuclear weapons invoked basic moral and religious intuitions. In one part of his address to the UN, Baruch said, \"Behind the black portent of the new atomic age lies a hope which, seized upon with faith, can work out our salvation. If we fail, then we have damned every man to be the slave of Fear. Let us not deceive ourselves. We must elect World Peace or World Destruction... We must answer the world's longing for peace and security.\" With this remark, Baruch helped launch the field of nuclear ethics, to which many policy experts and scholars have contributed.\n\nAlthough the Baruch Plan enjoyed wide international support, it failed to emerge from the UNAEC because the Soviet Union planned to veto it in the Security Council. Still, it remained official American policy until 1953, when President Eisenhower made his \"Atoms for Peace\" proposal before the U.N. General Assembly. Eisenhower's proposal led eventually to the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957. Under the \"Atoms for Peace\" program thousands of scientists from around the world were educated in nuclear science and then dispatched home, where many later pursued secret weapons programs in their home country.\n\nEfforts to conclude an international agreement to limit the spread of nuclear weapons did not begin until the early 1960s, after four nations (the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France) had acquired nuclear weapons (see List of states with nuclear weapons for more information). Although these efforts stalled in the early 1960s, they renewed once again in 1964, after China detonated a nuclear weapon. In 1968, governments represented at the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee (ENDC) finished negotiations on the text of the NPT. In June 1968, the U.N. General Assembly endorsed the NPT with General Assembly Resolution 2373 (XXII), and in July 1968, the NPT opened for signature in Washington, DC, London and Moscow. The NPT entered into force in March 1970.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, the primary focus of non-proliferation efforts has been to maintain, and even increase, international control over the fissile material and specialized technologies necessary to build such devices because these are the most difficult and expensive parts of a nuclear weapons program. The main materials whose generation and distribution is controlled are highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Other than the acquisition of these special materials, the scientific and technical means for weapons construction to develop rudimentary, but working, nuclear explosive devices are considered to be within the reach of industrialized nations.\n\nSince its founding by the United Nations in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has promoted two, sometimes contradictory, missions: on the one hand, the Agency seeks to promote and spread internationally the use of civilian nuclear energy; on the other hand, it seeks to prevent, or at least detect, the diversion of civilian nuclear energy to nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices or purposes unknown. The IAEA now operates a safeguards system as specified under Article III of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which aims to ensure that civil stocks of uranium and plutonium, as well as facilities and technologies associated with these nuclear materials, are used only for peaceful purposes and do not contribute in any way to proliferation or nuclear weapons programs. It is often argued that proliferation of nuclear weapons to many other states has been prevented by the extension of assurances and mutual defence treaties to these states by nuclear powers, but other factors, such as national prestige, or specific historical experiences, also play a part in hastening or stopping nuclear proliferation.\n\nDual-use technology refers to the possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology. Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that several stages of the nuclear fuel cycle allow diversion of nuclear materials for nuclear weapons. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to the atomic bomb or a public annex to a secret bomb program. The crisis over Iran’s nuclear activities is a case in point.\n\nMany UN and US agencies warn that building more nuclear reactors unavoidably increases nuclear proliferation risks. A fundamental goal for American and global security is to minimize the proliferation risks associated with the\nexpansion of nuclear power. If this development is \"poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous\". For nuclear power programs to be developed and managed safely and securely, it is important that countries have domestic “good governance” characteristics that will encourage proper nuclear operations and management:\n\nThese characteristics include low degrees of corruption (to avoid officials selling materials and technology for their own personal gain as occurred with the A.Q. Khan smuggling network in Pakistan), high degrees of political stability (defined by the World Bank as “likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including motivated violence and terrorism”), high governmental effectiveness scores (a World Bank aggregate measure of “the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures [and] the quality of policy formulation and implementation”), and a strong degree of regulatory competence.\n\nAt present, 189 countries are States Parties to the \"Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons\", more commonly known as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or NPT. These include the five Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) recognized by the NPT: the People's Republic of China, France, Russian Federation, the UK, and the United States.\n\nNotable non-signatories to the NPT are Israel, Pakistan, and India (the latter two have since tested nuclear weapons, while Israel is considered by most to be an unacknowledged nuclear weapons state). North Korea was once a signatory but withdrew in January 2003. The legality of North Korea's withdrawal is debatable but as of 9 October 2006, North Korea clearly possesses the capability to make a nuclear explosive device.\n\nThe IAEA was established on 29 July 1957 to help nations develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Allied to this role is the administration of safeguards arrangements to provide assurance to the international community that individual countries are honoring their commitments under the treaty. Though established under its own international treaty, the IAEA reports to both the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.\n\nThe IAEA regularly inspects civil nuclear facilities to verify the accuracy of documentation supplied to it. The agency checks inventories, and samples and analyzes materials. Safeguards are designed to deter diversion of nuclear material by increasing the risk of early detection. They are complemented by controls on the export of sensitive technology from countries such as UK and United States through voluntary bodies such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The main concern of the IAEA is that uranium not be enriched beyond what is necessary for commercial civil plants, and that plutonium which is produced by nuclear reactors not be refined into a form that would be suitable for bomb production.\n\nTraditional safeguards are arrangements to account for and control the use of nuclear materials. This verification is a key element in the international system which ensures that uranium in particular is used only for peaceful purposes.\n\nParties to the NPT agree to accept technical safeguard measures applied by the IAEA. These require that operators of nuclear facilities maintain and declare detailed accounting records of all movements and transactions involving nuclear material. Over 550 facilities and several hundred other locations are subject to regular inspection, and their records and the nuclear material being audited. Inspections by the IAEA are complemented by other measures such as surveillance cameras and instrumentation.\n\nThe inspections act as an alert system providing a warning of the possible diversion of nuclear material from peaceful activities. The system relies on;\n\nAll NPT non-weapons states must accept these full-scope safeguards. In the five weapons states plus the non-NPT states (India, Pakistan and Israel), facility-specific safeguards apply. IAEA inspectors regularly visit these facilities to verify completeness and accuracy of records.\n\nThe terms of the NPT cannot be enforced by the IAEA itself, nor can nations be forced to sign the treaty. In reality, as shown in Iraq and North Korea, safeguards can be backed up by diplomatic, political and economic measures.\n\nWhile traditional safeguards easily verified the correctness of formal declarations by suspect states, in the 1990s attention turned to what might not have been declared. While accepting safeguards at declared facilities, Iraq had set up elaborate equipment elsewhere in an attempt to enrich uranium to weapons grade. North Korea attempted to use research reactors (not commercial electricity-generating reactors) and a reprocessing plant to produce some weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nThe weakness of the NPT regime lay in the fact that no obvious diversion of material was involved. The uranium used as fuel probably came from indigenous sources, and the nuclear facilities were built by the countries themselves without being declared or placed under safeguards. Iraq, as an NPT party, was obliged to declare all facilities but did not do so. Nevertheless, the activities were detected and brought under control using international diplomacy. In Iraq, a military defeat assisted this process.\n\nIn North Korea, the activities concerned took place before the conclusion of its NPT safeguards agreement. With North Korea, the promised provision of commercial power reactors appeared to resolve the situation for a time, but it later withdrew from the NPT and declared it had nuclear weapons.\n\nIn 1993 a program was initiated to strengthen and extend the classical safeguards system, and a model protocol was agreed by the IAEA Board of Governors 1997. The measures boosted the IAEA's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities, including those with no connection to the civil fuel cycle.\n\nInnovations were of two kinds. Some could be implemented on the basis of IAEA's existing legal authority through safeguards agreements and inspections. Others required further legal authority to be conferred through an Additional Protocol. This must be agreed by each non-weapons state with IAEA, as a supplement to any existing comprehensive safeguards agreement. Weapons states have agreed to accept the principles of the model additional protocol.\n\nKey elements of the model Additional Protocol:\n\nAs of 3 July 2015, 146 countries have signed Additional Protocols and 126 have brought them into force. The IAEA is also applying the measures of the Additional Protocol in Taiwan. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran has agreed to implement its protocol provisionally. Among the leading countries that have not signed the Additional Protocol are Egypt, which says it will not sign until Israel accepts comprehensive IAEA safeguards, and Brazil, which opposes making the protocol a requirement for international cooperation on enrichment and reprocessing, but has not ruled out signing.\n\nThe greatest risk from nuclear weapons proliferation comes from countries which have not joined the NPT and which have significant unsafeguarded nuclear activities; India, Pakistan, and Israel fall within this category. While safeguards apply to some of their activities, others remain beyond scrutiny.\n\nA further concern is that countries may develop various sensitive nuclear fuel cycle facilities and research reactors under full safeguards and then subsequently opt out of the NPT. Bilateral agreements, such as insisted upon by Australia and Canada for sale of uranium, address this by including fallback provisions, but many countries are outside the scope of these agreements. If a nuclear-capable country does leave the NPT, it is likely to be reported by the IAEA to the UN Security Council, just as if it were in breach of its safeguards agreement. Trade sanctions would then be likely.\n\nIAEA safeguards can help ensure that uranium supplied as nuclear fuel and other nuclear supplies do not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation. In fact, the worldwide application of those safeguards and the substantial world trade in uranium for nuclear electricity make the proliferation of nuclear weapons much less likely.\n\nThe Additional Protocol, once it is widely in force, will provide credible assurance that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in the states concerned. This will be a major step forward in preventing nuclear proliferation.\n\nThe Nuclear Suppliers Group communicated its guidelines, essentially a set of export rules, to the IAEA in 1978. These were to ensure that transfers of nuclear material or equipment would not be diverted to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities, and formal government assurances to this effect were required from recipients. The Guidelines also recognised the need for physical protection measures in the transfer of sensitive facilities, technology and weapons-usable materials, and strengthened retransfer provisions. The group began with seven membersthe United States, the former USSR, the UK, France, Germany, Canada and Japanbut now includes 46 countries including all five nuclear weapons states.\n\nThe International Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation is an international project involving 25 partner countries, 28 observer and candidate partner countries, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Generation IV International Forum, and the European Commission. Its goal is to \"[..] provide competitive, commercially-based services as an alternative to a state’s development of costly, proliferation-sensitive facilities, and address other issues associated with the safe and secure management of used fuel and radioactive waste.\"\n\nAccording to Kenneth D. Bergeron's \"Tritium on Ice: The Dangerous New Alliance of Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Power\", tritium is not classified as a \"special nuclear material\" but rather as a by-product. It is seen as an important litmus test on the seriousness of the United States' intention to nuclear disarm. This radioactive super-heavy hydrogen isotope is used to boost the efficiency of fissile materials in nuclear weapons. The United States resumed tritium production in 2003 for the first time in 15 years. This could indicate that there is a potential nuclear arm stockpile replacement since the isotope naturally decays.\n\nIn May 1995, NPT parties reaffirmed their commitment to a Fissile Materials Cut-off Treaty to prohibit the production of any further fissile material for weapons. This aims to complement the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 (not entered into force as of 2011) and to codify commitments made by the United States, the UK, France and Russia to cease production of weapons material, as well as putting a similar ban on China. This treaty will also put more pressure on Israel, India and Pakistan to agree to international verification.\n\nOn 9 August 2005, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. Khamenei's official statement was made at the meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. As of February 2006 Iran formally announced that uranium enrichment within their borders has continued. Iran claims it is for peaceful purposes but the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the United States claim the purpose is for nuclear weapons research and construction.\n\nIndia, Pakistan and Israel have been \"threshold\" countries in terms of the international non-proliferation regime. They possess or are quickly capable of assembling one or more nuclear weapons. They have remained outside the 1970 NPT. They are thus largely excluded from trade in nuclear plant or materials, except for safety-related devices for a few safeguarded facilities.\n\nIn May 1998 India and Pakistan each exploded several nuclear devices underground. This heightened concerns regarding an arms race between them, with Pakistan involving the People's Republic of China, an acknowledged nuclear weapons state. Both countries are opposed to the NPT as it stands, and India has consistently attacked the Treaty since its inception in 1970 labeling it as a lopsided treaty in favor of the nuclear powers.\n\nRelations between the two countries are tense and hostile, and the risks of nuclear conflict between them have long been considered quite high. Kashmir is a prime cause of bilateral tension, its sovereignty being in dispute since 1948. There is persistent low level bilateral military conflict due to alleged backing of insurgency by Pakistan in India and infiltration of Pakistani state backed militants in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, along with the disputed status of Kashmir.\n\nBoth engaged in a conventional arms race in the 1980s, including sophisticated technology and equipment capable of delivering nuclear weapons. In the 1990s the arms race quickened. In 1994 India reversed a four-year trend of reduced allocations for defence, and despite its much smaller economy, Pakistan was expected to push its own expenditures yet higher. Both have lost their patrons: India, the former USSR, and Pakistan, the United States.\n\nBut it is the growth and modernization of China's nuclear arsenal and its assistance with Pakistan's nuclear power programme and, reportedly, with missile technology, which exacerbate Indian concerns. In particular, as viewed by Indian strategists, Pakistan is aided by China's People's Liberation Army.\n\nNuclear power for civil use is well established in India. Its civil nuclear strategy has been directed towards complete independence in the nuclear fuel cycle, necessary because of its outspoken rejection of the NPT. Due to economic and technological isolation of India after the nuclear tests in 1974, India has largely diverted focus on developing and perfecting the fast breeder technology by intensive materials and fuel cycle research at the dedicated center established for research into fast reactor technology, Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research (IGCAR) at Kalpakkam, in the southern part of the country. At the moment, India has a small fast breeder reactor and is planning a much larger one (Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor). This self-sufficiency extends from uranium exploration and mining through fuel fabrication, heavy water production, reactor design and construction, to reprocessing and waste management. It is also developing technology to utilise its abundant resources of thorium as a nuclear fuel.\n\nIndia has 14 small nuclear power reactors in commercial operation, two larger ones under construction, and ten more planned. The 14 operating ones (2548 MWe total) comprise:\n\nThe two under construction and two of the planned ones are 450 MWe versions of these 200 MWe domestic products. Construction has been seriously delayed by financial and technical problems. In 2001 a final agreement was signed with Russia for the country's first large nuclear power plant, comprising two VVER-1000 reactors, under a Russian-financed US$3 billion contract. The first unit is due to be commissioned in 2007. A further two Russian units are under consideration for the site. Nuclear power supplied 3.1% of India's electricity in 2000.\n\nIts weapons material appears to come from a Canadian-designed 40 MW \"research\" reactor which started up in 1960, well before the NPT, and a 100 MW indigenous unit in operation since 1985. Both use local uranium, as India does not import any nuclear fuel. It is estimated that India may have built up enough weapons-grade plutonium for a hundred nuclear warheads.\n\nIt is widely believed that the nuclear programs of India and Pakistan used CANDU reactors to produce fissionable materials for their weapons; however, this is not accurate. Both Canada (by supplying the 40 MW research reactor) and the United States (by supplying 21 tons of heavy water) supplied India with the technology necessary to create a nuclear weapons program, dubbed CIRUS (Canada-India Reactor, United States). Canada sold India the reactor on the condition that the reactor and any by-products would be \"employed for peaceful purposes only.\". Similarly, the United States sold India heavy water for use in the reactor \"only... in connection with research into and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes\". India, in violation of these agreements, used the Canadian-supplied reactor and American-supplied heavy water to produce plutonium for their first nuclear explosion, Smiling Buddha. The Indian government controversially justified this, however, by claiming that Smiling Buddha was a \"peaceful nuclear explosion.\"\n\nThe country has at least three other research reactors including the tiny one which is exploring the use of thorium as a nuclear fuel, by breeding fissile U-233. In addition, an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle is under development.\n\nIndia exploded a nuclear device in 1974, the so-called Smiling Buddha test, which it has consistently claimed was for peaceful purposes. Others saw it as a response to China's nuclear weapons capability. It was then universally perceived, notwithstanding official denials, to possess, or to be able to quickly assemble, nuclear weapons. In 1999 it deployed its own medium-range missile and has developed an intermediate-range missile capable of reaching targets in China's industrial heartland.\n\nIn 1995 the United States quietly intervened to head off a proposed nuclear test. However, in 1998 there were five more tests in Operation Shakti. These were unambiguously military, including one claimed to be of a sophisticated thermonuclear device, and their declared purpose was \"to help in the design of nuclear weapons of different yields and different delivery systems\".\n\nIndian security policies are driven by:\n\nIt perceives nuclear weapons as a cost-effective political counter to China's nuclear and conventional weaponry, and the effects of its nuclear weapons policy in provoking Pakistan is, by some accounts, considered incidental.\nIndia has had an unhappy relationship with China. After an uneasy ceasefire ended the 1962 war, relations between the two nations were frozen until 1998. Since then a degree of high-level contact has been established and a few elementary confidence-building measures put in place. China still occupies some territory which it captured during the aforementioned war, claimed by India, and India still occupies some territory claimed by China. Its nuclear weapon and missile support for Pakistan is a major bone of contention.\n\nAmerican President George W. Bush met with India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss India's involvement with nuclear weapons. The two countries agreed that the United States would give nuclear power assistance to India.\n\nOver the several years, the Nuclear power infrastructure has been well established by Pakistan which is dedicated for the industrial and economic development of the country. Its current nuclear policy is directed and aimed to promote the socio-economic development of the people as a \"foremost priority\"; and to fulfill the energy, economic, and industrial needs from the nuclear sources. Currently, there are three operational mega-commercial nuclear power plants while three larger ones are under construction. The nuclear power supplies 787 MW (roughly ≈3.6%) of electricity as of 2012, and the country has projected to produce 8800 MW electricity by 2030. Infrastructure established by the IAEA and the U.S. in the 1950s–1960s were based on peaceful research and development and economic prosperity of the country.\n\nAlthough the civil-sector nuclear power was established in the 1950s, the country has an active nuclear weapons program which was started in the 1970s. The bomb program has its roots after East-Pakistan gained its independence as Bangladesh after India's successful intervention led to a decisive victory on Pakistan in 1971. This large-scale but clandestine atomic bomb project was directed towards the development of ingenious development of reactor and military-grade plutonium. In 1974, when India surprised the outer world with its successful detonation of its own bomb, codename \"Smiling Buddha\", it became \"imperative for Pakistan\" to pursue the weapons research. According to leading scientist in the program, it became clear once India detonated the bomb, \"Newton's third law\" came into \"operation\", from then on it was a classic case of \"action and reaction\". Earlier efforts were directed towards mastering the plutonium technology from France, but plutonium route was partially slowed down when the plan was failed after the U.S. intervention to cancel the project. Contrary to popular perception, Pakistan did not forego the \"plutonium\" route and covertly continued its indegenious research under Munir Khan and it succeeded with plutonium route in the early 1980s. Reacting on India's nuclear test (Smiling Buddha), Bhutto and the country's elite political and military science circle sensed this test as final and dangerous anticipation to Pakistan's \"moral and physical existence.\" With Aziz Ahmed on his side, Bhutto launched a serious diplomatic offense and aggressively maintained at the session of the United Nations Security Council:\n\nAfter 1974, Bhutto's government redoubled its effort, this time equally focused on uranium and plutonium. Pakistan had established science directorates in almost all of her embassies in the important countries of the world, with theoretical physicist S.A. Butt being the director. Abdul Qadeer Khan then established a network through Dubai to smuggle URENCO technology to Engineering Research Laboratories. Earlier, he worked with \"Physics Dynamics Research Laboratories\" (FDO), a subsidiary of the Dutch firm VMF-Stork based in Amsterdam. Later after joining, the Urenco, he had access through photographs and documents of the technology. Against the popular perception, the technology that A.Q. Khan had brought from Urenco was based on first generation civil rector technology, filled with many serious technical errors, though it was authentic and vital link for centrifuge project of the country. After the British Government stopped the British subsidiary of the American Emerson Electric Co. from shipping the components to Pakistan, he describes his frustration with a supplier from Germany as: \"That man from the German team was unethical. When he did not get the order from us, he wrote a letter to a Labour Party member and questions were asked in [British] Parliament.\" By 1978, his efforts were paid off and made him into a national hero. In 1981, as a tribute, President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, renamed the research institute after his name.\n\nIn early 1996, Prime minister Benazir Bhutto made it clear that \"if India conducts a nuclear test, Pakistan could be forced to \"follow suit\". In 1997, her statement was echoed by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif who maintained to the fact that \"since 1972, [P]akistan had progressed significantly, and we have left that stage (developmental) far behind. Pakistan will not be made a \"hostage\" to India by signing the CTBT, before (India).!\" In May 1998, within weeks of India's nuclear tests, Pakistan announced that it had conducted six underground tests in the Chagai Hills, five on the 28th and one on the 30th of that month. Seismic events consistent with these claims were recorded.\n\nIn 2004, the revelation of A.Q. Khan's efforts led to the exposure of many defunct European consortiums which had defied export restrictions in the 1970s, and of many defunct Dutch companies that exported thousands of centrifuges to Pakistan as early as 1976. Many centrifuge components were apparently manufactured in Malaysian Scomi Precision Engineering with the assistance of South Asian and German companies, and used a UAE-based computer company as a false front.\n\nIt was widely believed to have direct involvement of the government of Pakistan. This claim could not be verified due to the refusal of the government of Pakistan to allow IAEA to interview the alleged head of the nuclear black market, who happened to be no other than A.Q. Khan. Confessing his crimes later a month on national television, he bailed out the government by taking full responsibility. Independent investigation conducted by IISS confirmed that he had control over the import-export deals, and his acquisition activities were largely unsupervised by Pakistan governmental authorities. All of his activities went undetected for several years. He duly confessed of running the atomic proliferation ring from Pakistan to Iran and North Korea. He was immediately given presidential immunity. Exact nature of the involvement at the governmental level is still unclear, but the manner in which the government acted cast doubt on the sincerity of Pakistan.\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea (or better known as North Korea), joined the NPT in 1985 and had subsequently signed a safeguards agreement with the IAEA. However, it was believed that North Korea was diverting plutonium extracted from the fuel of its reactor at Yongbyon, for use in nuclear weapons. The subsequent confrontation with IAEA on the issue of inspections and suspected violations, resulted in North Korea threatening to withdraw from the NPT in 1993. This eventually led to negotiations with the United States resulting in the Agreed Framework of 1994, which provided for IAEA safeguards being applied to its reactors and spent fuel rods. These spent fuel rods were sealed in canisters by the United States to prevent North Korea from extracting plutonium from them. North Korea had to therefore freeze its plutonium programme.\n\nDuring this period, Pakistan-North Korea cooperation in missile technology transfer was being established. A high level delegation of Pakistan military visited North Korea in August–September 1992, reportedly to discuss the supply of missile technology to Pakistan. In 1993, PM Benazir Bhutto repeatedly traveled to China, and the paid state visit to North Korea. The visits are believed to be related to the subsequent acquisition technology to developed its Ghauri system by Pakistan. During the period 1992–1994, A.Q. Khan was reported to have visited North Korea thirteen times. The missile cooperation program with North Korea was under Dr. A. Q. Khan Research Laboratories. At this time China was under U.S. pressure not to supply the M Dongfeng series of missiles to Pakistan. It is believed by experts that possibly with Chinese connivance and facilitation, the latter was forced to approach North Korea for missile transfers. Reports indicate that North Korea was willing to supply missile sub-systems including rocket motors, inertial guidance systems, control and testing equipment for US$50 million.\n\nIt is not clear what North Korea got in return. Joseph S. Bermudez Jr. in \"Jane's Defence Weekly\" (27 November 2002) reports that Western analysts had begun to question what North Korea received in payment for the missiles; many suspected it was the nuclear technology. The KRL was in charge of both uranium program and also of the missile program with North Korea. It is therefore likely during this period that cooperation in nuclear technology between Pakistan and North Korea was initiated. Western intelligence agencies began to notice exchange of personnel, technology and components between KRL and entities of the North Korean 2nd Economic Committee (responsible for weapons production).\n\nA \"New York Times\" report on 18 October 2002 quoted U.S. intelligence officials having stated that Pakistan was a major supplier of critical equipment to North Korea. The report added that equipment such as gas centrifuges appeared to have been \"part of a barter deal\" in which North Korea supplied Pakistan with missiles. Separate reports indicate (\"The Washington Times\", 22 November 2002) that U.S. intelligence had as early as 1999 picked up signs that North Korea was continuing to develop nuclear arms. Other reports also indicate that North Korea had been working covertly to develop an enrichment capability for nuclear weapons for at least five years and had used technology obtained from Pakistan (\"The Washington Times\", 18 October 2002).\n\nIsrael is also thought to possess an arsenal of potentially up to several hundred nuclear warheads based on estimates of the amount of fissile material produced by Israel. This has never been openly confirmed or denied however, due to Israel's policy of deliberate ambiguity.\n\nAn Israeli nuclear installation is located about ten kilometers to the south of Dimona, the Negev Nuclear Research Center. Its construction commenced in 1958, with French assistance. The official reason given by the Israeli and French governments was to build a nuclear reactor to power a \"desalination plant\", in order to \"green the Negev\". The purpose of the Dimona plant is widely assumed to be the manufacturing of nuclear weapons, and the majority of defense experts have concluded that it does in fact do that. However, the Israeli government refuses to confirm or deny this publicly, a policy it refers to as \"ambiguity\".\n\nNorway sold 20 tonnes of heavy water needed for the reactor to Israel in 1959 and 1960 in a secret deal. There were no \"safeguards\" required in this deal to prevent usage of the heavy water for non-peaceful purposes. The British newspaper \"Daily Express\" accused Israel of working on a bomb in 1960.\nWhen the United States intelligence community discovered the purpose of the Dimona plant in the early 1960s, it demanded that Israel agree to international inspections. Israel agreed, but on a condition that U.S., rather than IAEA, inspectors were used, and that Israel would receive advanced notice of all inspections.\nSome claim that because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to hide the alleged purpose of the site from the inspectors by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection. The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect. In 1969, the United States terminated the inspections.\n\nIn 1986, Mordechai Vanunu, a former technician at the Dimona plant, revealed to the media some evidence of Israel's nuclear program. Israeli agents arrested him from Italy, drugged him and transported him to Israel, and an Israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of treason and espionage, and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment. He was freed on 21 April 2004, but was severely limited by the Israeli government. He was arrested again on 11 November 2004, though formal charges were not immediately filed.\n\nComments on photographs taken by Mordechai Vanunu inside the Negev Nuclear Research Center have been made by prominent scientists. British nuclear weapons scientist Frank Barnaby, who questioned Vanunu over several days, estimated Israel had enough plutonium for about 150 weapons.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Colonel Warner D. Farr in a report to the USAF Counterproliferation Center while France was previously a leader in nuclear research \"Israel and France were at a similar level of expertise after WWII, and Israeli scientists could make significant contributions to the French effort.\" In 1986 Francis Perrin, French high-commissioner for atomic energy from 1951 to 1970 stated that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the Saclay nuclear research facility, this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe public stance of the two states on non-proliferation differs markedly. Pakistan has initiated a series of regional security proposals. It has repeatedly proposed a nuclear free zone in South Asia and has proclaimed its willingness to engage in nuclear disarmament and to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty if India would do so. It has endorsed a United States proposal for a regional five power conference to consider non-proliferation in South Asia.\n\nIndia has taken the view that solutions to regional security issues should be found at the international rather than the regional level, since its chief concern is with China. It therefore rejects Pakistan's proposals.\n\nInstead, the 'Gandhi Plan', put forward in 1988, proposed the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it regards as inherently discriminatory in favor of the nuclear-weapon States, and a timetable for complete nuclear weapons disarmament. It endorsed early proposals for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and for an international convention to ban the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons purposes, known as the 'cut-off' convention.\n\nThe United States for some years, especially under the Clinton administration, pursued a variety of initiatives to persuade India and Pakistan to abandon their nuclear weapons programs and to accept comprehensive international safeguards on all their nuclear activities. To this end, the Clinton administration proposed a conference of the five nuclear-weapon states, Japan, Germany, India and Pakistan.\n\nIndia refused this and similar previous proposals, and countered with demands that other potential weapons states, such as Iran and North Korea, should be invited, and that regional limitations would only be acceptable if they were accepted equally by China. The United States would not accept the participation of Iran and North Korea and these initiatives have lapsed.\n\nAnother, more recent approach, centers on 'capping' the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, which would hopefully be followed by 'roll back'. To this end, India and the United States jointly sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution in 1993 calling for negotiations for a 'cut-off' convention. Should India and Pakistan join such a convention, they would have to agree to halt the production of fissile materials for weapons and to accept international verification on their relevant nuclear facilities (enrichment and reprocessing plants). It appears that India is now prepared to join negotiations regarding such a Cut-off Treaty, under the UN Conference on Disarmament.\n\nBilateral confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan to reduce the prospects of confrontation have been limited. In 1990 each side ratified a treaty not to attack the other's nuclear installations, and at the end of 1991 they provided one another with a list showing the location of all their nuclear plants, even though the respective lists were regarded as not being wholly accurate. Early in 1994 India proposed a bilateral agreement for a 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and an extension of the 'no attack' treaty to cover civilian and industrial targets as well as nuclear installations.\n\nHaving promoted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since 1954, India dropped its support in 1995 and in 1996 attempted to block the Treaty. Following the 1998 tests the question has been reopened and both Pakistan and India have indicated their intention to sign the CTBT. Indian ratification may be conditional upon the five weapons states agreeing to specific reductions in nuclear arsenals. The UN Conference on Disarmament has also called upon both countries \"to accede without delay to the Non-Proliferation Treaty\", presumably as non-weapons states.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Egypt disclosed past undeclared nuclear activities and material to the IAEA. In 2007 and 2008, high enriched and low enriched uranium particles were found in environmental samples taken in Egypt. In 2008, the IAEA states Egypt's statements were consistent with its own findings. In May 2009, \"Reuters\" reported that the IAEA was conducting further investigation in Egypt.\n\nIn 2003, the IAEA reported that Iran had been in breach of its obligations to comply with provisions of its safeguard agreement. In 2005, the IAEA Board of Governors voted in a rare non-consensus decision to find Iran in non-compliance with its NPT Safeguards Agreement and to report that non-compliance to the UN Security Council. In response, the UN Security Council passed a series of resolutions citing concerns about the program. Iran's representative to the UN argues sanctions compel Iran to abandon its rights under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to peaceful nuclear technology. Iran says its uranium enrichment program is exclusively for peaceful purposes and has enriched uranium to \"less than 5 percent,\" consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and significantly below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, said in 2009 he had not seen any evidence in IAEA official documents that Iran was developing nuclear weapons.\n\nUp to the late 1980s it was generally assumed that any undeclared nuclear activities would have to be based on the diversion of nuclear material from safeguards. States acknowledged the possibility of nuclear activities entirely separate from those covered by safeguards, but it was assumed they would be detected by national intelligence activities. There was no particular effort by IAEA to attempt to detect them.\n\nIraq had been making efforts to secure a nuclear potential since the 1960s. In the late 1970s a specialised plant, Osiraq, was constructed near Baghdad. The plant was attacked during the Iran–Iraq War and was destroyed by Israeli bombers in June 1981.\n\nNot until the 1990 NPT Review Conference did some states raise the possibility of making more use of (for example) provisions for \"special inspections\" in existing NPT Safeguards Agreements. Special inspections can be undertaken at locations other than those where safeguards routinely apply, if there is reason to believe there may be undeclared material or activities.\n\nAfter inspections in Iraq following the UN Gulf War cease-fire resolution showed the extent of Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons program, it became clear that the IAEA would have to broaden the scope of its activities. Iraq was an NPT Party, and had thus agreed to place all its nuclear material under IAEA safeguards. But the inspections revealed that it had been pursuing an extensive clandestine uranium enrichment programme, as well as a nuclear weapons design programme.\n\nThe main thrust of Iraq's uranium enrichment program was the development of technology for electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) of indigenous uranium. This uses the same principles as a mass spectrometer (albeit on a much larger scale). Ions of uranium-238 and uranium-235 are separated because they describe arcs of different radii when they move through a magnetic field. This process was used in the Manhattan Project to make the highly enriched uranium used in the Hiroshima bomb, but was abandoned soon afterwards.\n\nThe Iraqis did the basic research work at their nuclear research establishment at Tuwaitha, near Baghdad, and were building two full-scale facilities at Tarmiya and Ash Sharqat, north of Baghdad. However, when the war broke out, only a few separators had been installed at Tarmiya, and none at Ash Sharqat.\n\nThe Iraqis were also very interested in centrifuge enrichment, and had been able to acquire some components including some carbon-fibre rotors, which they were at an early stage of testing. In May 1998, \"Newsweek\" reported that Abdul Qadeer Khan had sent Iraq centrifuge designs, which were apparently confiscated by the UNMOVIC officials. Iraqi officials said \"the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with A. Q. Khan, fearing an ISI sting operation, due to strained relations between two countries. The Government of Pakistan and A. Q. Khan strongly denied this allegation whilst the government declared the evidence to be \"fraudulent\".\n\nThey were clearly in violation of their NPT and safeguards obligations, and the IAEA Board of Governors ruled to that effect. The UN Security Council then ordered the IAEA to remove, destroy or render harmless Iraq's nuclear weapons capability. This was done by mid-1998, but Iraq then ceased all cooperation with the UN, so the IAEA withdrew from this work.\n\nThe revelations from Iraq provided the impetus for a very far-reaching reconsideration of what safeguards are intended to achieve.\n\nLibya possesses ballistic missiles and previously pursued nuclear weapons under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi. On 19 December 2003, Gaddafi announced that Libya would voluntarily eliminate all materials, equipment and programs that could lead to internationally proscribed weapons, including weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles. Libya signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and ratified it in 1975, and concluded a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1980. In March 2004, the IAEA Board of Governors welcomed Libya's decision to eliminate its formerly undeclared nuclear program, which it found had violated Libya's safeguards agreement, and approved Libya's Additional Protocol. The United States and the United Kingdom assisted Libya in removing equipment and material from its nuclear weapons program, with independent verification by the IAEA.\n\nA report in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"Searchina\", a Japanese newspaper, report that two Myanma defectors saying that the Myanmar junta was secretly building a nuclear reactor and plutonium extraction facility with North Korea's help, with the aim of acquiring its first nuclear bomb in five years. According to the report, \"The secret complex, much of it in caves tunnelled into a mountain at Naung Laing in northern Burma, runs parallel to a civilian reactor being built at another site by Russia that both the Russians and Burmese say will be put under international safeguards.\" In 2002, Myanmar had notified IAEA of its intention to pursue a civilian nuclear programme. Later, Russia announced that it would build a nuclear reactor in Myanmar. There have also been reports that two Pakistani scientists, from the AQ Khan stable, had been dispatched to Myanmar where they had settled down, to help Myanmar's project. Recently, the David Albright-led Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) rang alarm bells about Myanmar attempting a nuclear project with North Korean help. If true, the full weight of international pressure will be brought against Myanmar, said officials familiar with developments. But equally, the information that has been peddled by the defectors is also \"preliminary\" and could be used by the west to turn the screws on Myanmar—on democracy and human rights issues—in the run-up to the elections in the country in 2010. During an ASEAN meeting in Thailand in July 2009, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton highlighted concerns of the North Korean link. \"We know there are also growing concerns about military cooperation between North Korea and Burma which we take very seriously,\" Clinton said. However, in 2012, after contact with the American president, Barack Obama, the Burmese leader, Thein Sein, renounced military ties with DPRK (North Korea).\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) acceded to the NPT in 1985 as a condition for the supply of a nuclear power station by the USSR. However, it delayed concluding its NPT Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA, a process which should take only 18 months, until April 1992.\n\nDuring that period, it brought into operation a small gas-cooled, graphite-moderated, natural-uranium (metal) fuelled \"Experimental Power Reactor\" of about 25 MWt (5 MWe), based on the UK Magnox design. While this was a well-suited design to start a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development, it also exhibited all the features of a small plutonium production reactor for weapons purposes. North Korea also made substantial progress in the construction of two larger reactors designed on the same principles, a prototype of about 200 MWt (50 MWe), and a full-scale version of about 800 MWt (200 MWe). They made only slow progress; construction halted on both in 1994 and has not resumed. Both reactors have degraded considerably since that time and would take significant efforts to refurbish.\n\nIn addition it completed and commissioned a reprocessing plant that makes the Magnox spent nuclear fuel safe, recovering uranium and plutonium. That plutonium, if the fuel was only irradiated to a very low burn-up, would have been in a form very suitable for weapons. Although all these facilities at Yongbyon were to be under safeguards, there was always the risk that at some stage, the DPRK would withdraw from the NPT and use the plutonium for weapons.\n\nOne of the first steps in applying NPT safeguards is for the IAEA to verify the initial stocks of uranium and plutonium to ensure that all the nuclear materials in the country have been declared for safeguards purposes. While undertaking this work in 1992, IAEA inspectors found discrepancies which indicated that the reprocessing plant had been used more often than the DPRK had declared, which suggested that the DPRK could have weapons-grade plutonium which it had not declared to the IAEA. Information passed to the IAEA by a Member State (as required by the IAEA) supported that suggestion by indicating that the DPRK had two undeclared waste or other storage sites.\n\nIn February 1993 the IAEA called on the DPRK to allow special inspections of the two sites so that the initial stocks of nuclear material could be verified. The DPRK refused, and on 12 March announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT (three months' notice is required). In April 1993 the IAEA Board concluded that the DPRK was in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations and reported the matter to the UN Security Council. In June 1993 the DPRK announced that it had \"suspended\" its withdrawal from the NPT, but subsequently claimed a \"special status\" with respect to its safeguards obligations. This was rejected by IAEA.\n\nOnce the DPRK's non-compliance had been reported to the UN Security Council, the essential part of the IAEA's mission had been completed. Inspections in the DPRK continued, although inspectors were increasingly hampered in what they were permitted to do by the DPRK's claim of a \"special status\". However, some 8,000 corroding fuel rods associated with the experimental reactor have remained under close surveillance.\n\nFollowing bilateral negotiations between the United States and the DPRK, and the conclusion of the Agreed Framework in October 1994, the IAEA has been given additional responsibilities. The agreement requires a freeze on the operation and construction of the DPRK's plutonium production reactors and their related facilities, and the IAEA is responsible for monitoring the freeze until the facilities are eventually dismantled. The DPRK remains uncooperative with the IAEA verification work and has yet to comply with its safeguards agreement.\n\nWhile Iraq was defeated in a war, allowing the UN the opportunity to seek out and destroy its nuclear weapons programme as part of the cease-fire conditions, the DPRK was not defeated, nor was it vulnerable to other measures, such as trade sanctions. It can scarcely afford to import anything, and sanctions on vital commodities, such as oil, would either be ineffective or risk provoking war.\n\nUltimately, the DPRK was persuaded to stop what appeared to be its nuclear weapons programme in exchange, under the agreed framework, for about US$5 billion in energy-related assistance. This included two 1000 MWe light water nuclear power reactors based on an advanced U.S. System-80 design.\n\nIn January 2003 the DPRK withdrew from the NPT. In response, a series of discussions among the DPRK, the United States, and China, a series of six-party talks (the parties being the DPRK, the ROK, China, Japan, the United States and Russia) were held in Beijing; the first beginning in April 2004 concerning North Korea's weapons program.\n\nOn 10 January 2005, North Korea declared that it was in the possession of nuclear weapons. On 19 September 2005, the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks ended with a joint statement in which North Korea agreed to end its nuclear programs and return to the NPT in exchange for diplomatic, energy and economic assistance. However, by the end of 2005 the DPRK had halted all six-party talks because the United States froze certain DPRK international financial assets such as those in a bank in Macau.\n\nOn 9 October 2006, North Korea announced that it has performed its first-ever nuclear weapon test. On 18 December 2006, the six-party talks finally resumed. On 13 February 2007, the parties announced \"Initial Actions\" to implement the 2005 joint statement including shutdown and disablement of North Korean nuclear facilities in exchange for energy assistance. Reacting to UN sanctions imposed after missile tests in April 2009, North Korea withdrew from the six-party talks, restarted its nuclear facilities and conducted a second nuclear test on 25 May 2009.\n\nOn 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion with an estimated yield of 6 to 7 kilotonnes. The detonation registered a magnitude 4.9 disturbance in the area around the epicenter.\n\n\"See also: North Korea and weapons of mass destruction and Six-party talks\"\n\nSecurity of nuclear weapons in Russia remains a matter of concern. According to high-ranking Russian SVR defector Tretyakov, he had a meeting with two Russian businessman representing a state-created \"C-W\" corporation in 1991. They came up with a project of destroying large quantities of chemical wastes collected from Western countries at the island of Novaya Zemlya (a test place for Soviet nuclear weapons) using an underground nuclear blast. The project was rejected by Canadian representatives, but one of the businessmen told Tretyakov that he keeps his own nuclear bomb at his dacha outside Moscow. Tretyakov thought that man was insane, but the \"businessmen\" (Vladimir K. Dmitriev) replied: \"Do not be so naive. With economic conditions the way they are in Russia today, anyone with enough money can buy a nuclear bomb. It's no big deal really\".\n\nIn 1991, South Africa acceded to the NPT, concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and submitted a report on its nuclear material subject to safeguards. At the time, the state had a nuclear power programme producing nearly 10% of the country's electricity, whereas Iraq and North Korea only had research reactors.\n\nThe IAEA's initial verification task was complicated by South Africa's announcement that between 1979 and 1989 it built and then dismantled a number of nuclear weapons. South Africa asked the IAEA to verify the conclusion of its weapons programme. In 1995 the IAEA declared that it was satisfied all materials were accounted for and the weapons programme had been terminated and dismantled.\n\nSouth Africa has signed the NPT, and now holds the distinction of being the only known state to have indigenously produced nuclear weapons, and then verifiably dismantled them.\n\nOn 6 September 2007, Israel bombed an officially unidentified site in Syria which it later asserted was a nuclear reactor under construction (\"see Operation Outside the Box\"). The alleged reactor was not asserted to be operational and it was not asserted that nuclear material had been introduced into it. Syria said the site was a military site and was not involved in any nuclear activities. The IAEA requested Syria to provide further access to the site and any other locations where the debris and equipment from the building had been stored. Syria denounced what it called the Western \"fabrication and forging of facts\" in regards to the incident. IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei criticized the strikes and deplored that information regarding the matter had not been shared with his agency earlier.\n\nFor a state that does not possess nuclear weapons, the capability to produce one or more weapons quickly and with little warning is called a breakout capability.\n\n\nThere has been much debate in the academic study of International Security as to the advisability of proliferation. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gen. Pierre Marie Gallois of France, an adviser to Charles DeGaulle, argued in books like \"The Balance of Terror: Strategy for the Nuclear Age\" (1961) that mere possession of a nuclear arsenal, what the French called the \"force de frappe\", was enough to ensure deterrence, and thus concluded that the spread of nuclear weapons could increase international stability.\n\nSome very prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, Emeritus Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University, and John Mearsheimer, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, continue to argue along the lines of Gallois in a separate development. Specifically, these scholars advocate some forms of nuclear proliferation, arguing that it will decrease the likelihood of war, especially in troubled regions of the world. Aside from the majority opinion which opposes proliferation in any form, there are two schools of thought on the matter: those, like Mearsheimer, who favor selective proliferation, and those such as Waltz, who advocate a laissez-faire attitude to programs like North Korea's.\n\nIn embryo, Waltz argues that the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD) should work in all security environments, regardless of historical tensions or recent hostility. He sees the Cold War as the ultimate proof of MAD logicthe only occasion when enmity between two Great Powers did not result in military conflict. This was, he argues, because nuclear weapons promote caution in decision-makers. Neither Washington nor Moscow would risk a nuclear apocalypse to advance territorial or power goals, hence a peaceful stalemate ensued (Waltz and Sagan (2003), p. 24). Waltz believes there to be no reason why this effect would not occur in all circumstances.\n\nJohn Mearsheimer would not support Waltz's optimism in the majority of potential instances; however, he has argued for nuclear proliferation as policy in certain places, such as post–Cold War Europe. In two famous articles, Professor Mearsheimer opines that Europe is bound to return to its pre–Cold War environment of regular conflagration and suspicion at some point in the future. He advocates arming both Germany and Ukraine with nuclear weaponry in order to achieve a balance of power between these states in the east and France/UK in the west. If this does not occur, he is certain that war will eventually break out on the European continent.\n\nAnother separate argument against Waltz's open proliferation and in favor of Mearsheimer's selective distribution is the possibility of nuclear terrorism. Some countries included in the aforementioned laissez-faire distribution could predispose the transfer of nuclear materials or a bomb falling into the hands of groups not affiliated with any governments. Such countries would not have the political will or ability to safeguard attempts at devices being transferred to a third party. Not being deterred by self-annihilation, terrorism groups could push forth their own nuclear agendas or be used as shadow fronts to carry out the attack plans by mentioned unstable governments.\n\nThere are numerous arguments presented against both selective and total proliferation, generally targeting the very neorealist assumptions (such as the primacy of military security in state agendas, the weakness of international institutions, and the long-run unimportance of economic integration and globalization to state strategy) its proponents tend to make. With respect to Mearsheimer's specific example of Europe, many economists and neoliberals argue that the economic integration of Europe through the development of the European Union has made war in most of the European continent so disastrous economically so as to serve as an effective deterrent. Constructivists take this one step further, frequently arguing that the development of EU political institutions has led or will lead to the development of a nascent European identity, which most states on the European continent wish to partake in to some degree or another, and which makes all states within or aspiring to be within the EU regard war between them as unthinkable.\n\nAs for Waltz, the general opinion is that most states are not in a position to safely guard against nuclear use, that he underestimates the long-standing antipathy in many regions, and that weak states will be unable to prevent – or will actively provide for – the disastrous possibility of nuclear terrorism. Waltz has dealt with all of these objections at some point in his work; though to many, he has not adequately responded (Betts (2000)).\n\nThe Learning Channel documentary Doomsday: \"On The Brink\" illustrated 40 years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons accidents. Even the 1995 Norwegian rocket incident demonstrated a potential scenario in which Russian democratization and military downsizing at the end of the Cold War did not eliminate the danger of accidental nuclear war through command and control errors. After asking: might a future Russian ruler or renegade Russian general be tempted to use nuclear weapons to make foreign policy? The documentary writers revealed a greater danger of Russian security over its nuclear stocks, but especially the ultimate danger of human nature to want the ultimate weapon of mass destruction to exercise political and military power. Future world leaders might not understand how close the Soviets, Russians, and Americans were to doomsday, how easy it all seemed because apocalypse was avoided for a mere 40 years between rivals, politicians not terrorists, who loved their children and did not want to die, against 30,000 years of human prehistory. History and military experts agree that proliferation can be slowed, but never stopped (technology cannot be uninvented).\n\nProliferation begets proliferation is a concept described by Scott Sagan in his article, \"Why Do States Build Nuclear Weapons?\". This concept can be described as a strategic chain reaction. If one state produces a nuclear weapon it creates almost a domino effect within the region. States in the region will seek to acquire nuclear weapons to balance or eliminate the security threat. Sagan describes this reaction best in his article when he states, “Every time one state develops nuclear weapons to balance against its main rival, it also creates a nuclear threat to another region, which then has to initiate its own nuclear weapons program to maintain its national security”. Going back through history we can see how this has taken place. When the United States demonstrated that it had nuclear power capabilities after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Russians started to develop their program in preparation for the Cold War. With the Russian military buildup, France and the United Kingdom perceived this as a security threat and therefore they pursued nuclear weapons (Sagan, pg 71). Even though proliferation causes proliferation, this does not guarantee that other states will successfully develop nuclear weapons because the economic stability of a state plays an important role on whether the state will successfully be able to acquire nuclear weapons. The article written by Dong-Jong Joo and Erik Gartzke discusses how the economy of a country determines whether they will successfully acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nFormer Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been a frequent critic of the concept of \"nuclear apartheid\" as it has been put into practice by several countries, particularly the United States. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Ahmadinejad said that Iran was \"against 'nuclear apartheid,' which means some have the right to possess it, use the fuel, and then sell it to another country for 10 times its value. We're against that. We say clean energy is the right of all countries. But also it is the duty and the responsibility of all countries, including ours, to set up frameworks to stop the proliferation of it.\" Hours after that interview, he spoke passionately in favor of Iran's right to develop nuclear technology, claiming the nation should have the same liberties.\n\nIran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and claims that any work done in regards to nuclear technology is related only to civilian uses, which is acceptable under the treaty. Iran violated its safeguards obligations under the treaty by performing uranium-enrichment in secret, after which the United Nations Security Council ordered Iran to suspend all uranium-enrichment until July 2015.\n\nIndia has also been discussed in the context of \"nuclear apartheid\". India has consistently attempted to pass measures that would call for full international disarmament, however they have not succeeded due to protests from those states that already have nuclear weapons. In light of this, India viewed nuclear weapons as a necessary right for all nations as long as certain states were still in possession of nuclear weapons. India stated that nuclear issues were directly related to national security.\n\nYears before India's first underground nuclear test in 1998, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was passed. Some have argued that coercive language was used in an attempt to persuade India to sign the treaty, which was pushed for heavily by neighboring China. India viewed the treaty as a means for countries that already had nuclear weapons, primarily the five nations of the United Nations Security Council, to keep their weapons while ensuring that no other nations could develop them.\n\nIn their article, \"The Correlates of Nuclear Proliferation,\" Sonali Singh and Christopher R. Way argue that states protected by a security guarantee from a great power, particularly if backed by the \"nuclear umbrella\" of extended deterrence, have less of an incentive to acquire their own nuclear weapons. States that lack such guarantees are more likely to feel their security threatened and so have greater incentives to bolster or assemble nuclear arsenals. As a result, it is then argued that bipolarity may prevent proliferation where as multipolarity may actually influence proliferation.\n\n"}
{"id": "22522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22522", "title": "Oscillation", "text": "Oscillation\n\nOscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. The term \"vibration\" is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current.\n\nOscillations occur not only in mechanical systems but also in dynamic systems in virtually every area of science: for example the beating of the human heart (for circulation), business cycles in economics, predator–prey population cycles in ecology, geothermal geysers in geology, vibration of strings in guitar and other string instruments, periodic firing of nerve cells in the brain, and the periodic swelling of Cepheid variable stars in astronomy.\n\nThe simplest mechanical oscillating system is a weight attached to a linear spring subject to only weight and tension. Such a system may be approximated on an air table or ice surface. The system is in an equilibrium state when the spring is static. If the system is displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net \"restoring force\" on the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium. However, in moving the mass back to the equilibrium position, it has acquired momentum which keeps it moving beyond that position, establishing a new restoring force in the opposite sense. If a constant force such as gravity is added to the system, the point of equilibrium is shifted. The time taken for an oscillation to occur is often referred to as the oscillatory \"period\".\n\nThe systems where the restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its displacement, such as the dynamics of the spring-mass system, are described mathematically by the simple harmonic oscillator and the regular periodic motion is known as simple harmonic motion. In the spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, at the static equilibrium displacement, the mass has kinetic energy which is converted into potential energy stored in the spring at the extremes of its path. The spring-mass system illustrates some common features of oscillation, namely the existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the system deviates from equilibrium.\n\nAll real-world oscillator systems are thermodynamically irreversible. This means there are dissipative processes such as friction or electrical resistance which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. This is called damping. Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.\n\nIn addition, an oscillating system may be subject to some external force, as when an AC circuit is connected to an outside power source. In this case the oscillation is said to be \"driven\".\n\nSome systems can be excited by energy transfer from the environment. This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded in some fluid flow. For example, the phenomenon of flutter in aerodynamics occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an aircraft wing (from its equilibrium) results in an increase in the angle of attack of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in lift coefficient, leading to a still greater displacement. At sufficiently large displacements, the stiffness of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enables an oscillation.\n\nThe harmonic oscillator and the systems it models have a single degree of freedom. More complicated systems have more degrees of freedom, for example two masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed points and to each other). In such cases, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others. This leads to a \"coupling\" of the oscillations of the individual degrees of freedom. For example, two pendulum clocks (of identical frequency) mounted on a common wall will tend to synchronise. This phenomenon was first observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665. The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically appears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simpler and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into normal modes.\n\nMore special cases are the coupled oscillators where energy alternates between two forms of oscillation. Well-known is the Wilberforce pendulum, where the oscillation alternates between an elongation of a vertical spring and the rotation of an object at the end of that spring.\n\nAs the number of degrees of freedom becomes arbitrarily large, a system approaches continuity; examples include a string or the surface of a body of water. Such systems have (in the classical limit) an infinite number of normal modes and their oscillations occur in the form of waves that can characteristically propagate.\n\nThe mathematics of oscillation deals with the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes. There are several related notions: oscillation of a sequence of real numbers, oscillation of a real valued function at a point, and oscillation of a function on an interval (or open set).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22529", "title": "Onomatopoeia", "text": "Onomatopoeia\n\nOnomatopœia (; from the Greek ὀνοματοποιία; ὄνομα for \"name\" and ποιέω for \"I make\", adjectival form: \"onomatopœic\" or \"onomatopœtic\") is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. As such words are uncountable nouns, \"onomatopoeia\" refers to the property of such words. Common occurrences of words of the onomatopoeia process include animal noises such as \"oink\", \"miaow\" (or \"meow\"), \"roar\" and \"chirp\". Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as \"tick tock\" in English, \"tictac\" in Spanish, \"dī dā\" in Mandarin, \"katchin katchin\" in Japanese, or \"tik-tik\" in Hindi.\n\nAlthough in the English language the term onomatopœia means \"the imitation of a sound\", the compound word \"onomatopœia\" (ὀνοματοποιία) in the Greek language means \"making or creating names\". For words that imitate sounds, the term ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) or echomimetic) is used. The word ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) derives from \"ὴχώ\", meaning echo or sound, and \"μιμητικό\", meaning mimetic or imitating.\n\nIn the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek \"brekekekex koax koax\" (only in Aristophanes' comic play \"The Frogs\") probably for marsh frogs; English \"ribbit\" for species of frog found in North America; English verb \"croak\" for the common frog.\n\nSome other very common English-language examples are \"hiccup\", \"zoom\", \"bang\", \"beep\", \"moo\", and \"splash\". Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: \"honk\" or \"beep-beep\" for the horn of an automobile, and \"vroom\" or \"brum\" for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word \"zap\" is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough interference or destruction similar to that produced in short-circuit sparking).\n\nHuman sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when \"mwah\" is used to represent a kiss.\n\nFor animal sounds, words like \"quack\" (duck), \"moo\" (cow), \"bark\" or \"woof\" (dog), \"roar\" (lion), \"meow\"/\"miaow\" or \"purr\" (cat), \"cluck\" (chicken) and \"baa\" (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).\n\nSome languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word \"bleat\" for sheep noise: in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as \"blairt\" (but without an R-component), or \"blet\" with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.\n\nAn example of the opposite case is \"cuckoo\", which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo-Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word \"furrow\".\n\n\"Verba dicendi\" (\"words of saying\") are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar.\n\nSometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the zip (in the UK) or zipper (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the bobwhite quail, the weero, the morepork, the killdeer, chickadees and jays, the cuckoo, the chiffchaff, the whooping crane, the whip-poor-will, and the kookaburra. In Tamil and Malayalam, the word for crow is \"kaakaa\". This practice is especially common in certain languages such as Māori, and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.\n\nAlthough a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages. For example, the \"snip\" of a pair of scissors is \"cri-cri\" in Italian, \"riqui-riqui\" in Spanish, \"terre-terre\" or \"treque-treque\" in Portuguese, \"krits-krits\" in modern Greek and \"katr-katr\" in Hindi. Similarly, the \"honk\" of a car's horn is \"ba-ba\" (Han: 叭叭) in Mandarin, \"tut-tut\" in French, \"pu-pu\" in Japanese, \"bbang-bbang\" in Korean, \"bært-bært\" in Norwegian, \"fom-fom\" in Portuguese and \"bim-bim\" in Vietnamese.\n\nAn onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase \"\"furrow followed free\"\" in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The words \"followed\" and \"free\" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with \"furrow\" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line \"\"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore...\"\", to recreate the sound of breaking waves, in the poem \"I, She and the Sea\".\n\nComic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist Roy Crane (1901–1977), the creator of \"Captain Easy\" and \"Buz Sawyer\":\n\nIn 2002, DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia, an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who often speaks pure sounds.\n\nAdvertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in Alka-Seltzer's \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!\" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by Sammy Davis, Jr.\n\nRice Krispies (US and UK) and Rice Bubbles (AU) make a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator Vernon Grant developed Snap, Crackle and Pop as gnome-like mascots for the Kellogg Company.\n\nSounds appear in road safety advertisements: \"clunk click, every trip\" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or \"click, clack, front and back\" (click, clack of connecting the seat belts; AU campaign) or \"click it or ticket\" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).\n\nThe sound of the container opening and closing gives Tic Tac its name.\n\nIn many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese \"barabara\" is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and \"shiiin\" is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). It is used in English as well with terms like \"bling\", which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, \"kirakira\" is used for glittery things.\n\n\nA key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound. No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn't necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with \"sn-\". Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (\"sneeze\", \"snot\", \"snore\"). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.\n\nIn linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound. It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a “buzz” sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.\n\nOnomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process. The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a phoneme, is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language’s connection to a sound's meaning, that language’s onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.\n\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this. Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.\n\nIn the development of a language, sounds that are associated with natural objects then go on to form words with related meanings. For example, \"gl-\" at the beginning of an English word can denote something that is shining or iridescent (e.g. glitter, glisten, gleam).\n\nWhen first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds. Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called \"tame\" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or \"wild\" onomatopoeia. As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of \"wild\" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.\n\nDuring the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.\n\nIn the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role. The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma with either a round or angular shape, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.\n\n\"Main article: Japanese sound symbolism\"\n\nThe Japanese language has a large inventory of ideophone words that are symbolic sounds. These are used in contexts ranging from day to day conversation to serious news. These words fall into four categories:\n\nThe two former correspond directly to the concept of onomatopoeia, while the two latter are similar to onomatopoeia in that they are intented to represent a concept mimetically and performatively rather than referentially, but different from onomatopoeia in that they aren't just imitative of sounds. For example, \"shiinto\" represents something being silent, just as how an anglophone might say \"clatter, crash, bang!\" to represent something being noisy. That \"representative\" or \"performative\" aspect is the similarity to onomatopoeia.\n\nSometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.\n\nThere is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded. As well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok, kelok and telok (locomotive, cove and curve respectively).\n\nWithin the Qur'an, written in Arabic, instances of onomatopoeia are documented. Out of about 77,701 words, there are 9 words that are onomatopoeic, 3 which are animal sounds (e.g. \"mooing\"), 2 which are sounds of nature (e.g. \"thunder\") and 4 that are human sounds (e.g. \"whisper\" or \"groan\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22775", "title": "Old Fashioned", "text": "Old Fashioned\n\nThe Old Fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters, then adding alcohol, originally whiskey but now sometimes brandy and finally a twist of citrus rind. It is traditionally served in a short, round, tumbler-like glass, which is called an Old Fashioned glass, after the drink.\n\nThe Old Fashioned, developed during the 19th century and given its name in the 1880s, is an IBA Official Cocktail. It is also one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's \"The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks\".\n\nThe first documented definition of the word \"cocktail\" was in response to a reader's letter asking to define the word in the May 6, 1806 issue of \"The Balance and Columbian Repository\" in Hudson, New York. In the May 13, 1806 issue, the paper's editor wrote that it was a potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar; it was also referred to at the time as a bittered sling.\nJ.E. Alexander describes the cocktail similarly in 1833, as he encountered it in New York City, as being rum, gin, or brandy, significant water, bitters, and sugar, though he includes a nutmeg garnish as well.\n\nBy the 1860s, it was common for orange curaçao, absinthe, and other liqueurs to be added to the cocktail. The original concoction, albeit in different proportions, came back into vogue, and was referred to as \"old-fashioned\". The most popular of the in-vogue \"old-fashioned\" cocktails were made with whiskey, according to a Chicago barman, quoted in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" in 1882, with rye being more popular than Bourbon. The recipe he describes is a similar combination of spirits, bitters, water and sugar of seventy-six years earlier.\n\nThe first use of the name \"Old Fashioned\" for a Bourbon whiskey cocktail was said to have been at the Pendennis Club, a gentlemen's club founded in 1881 in Louisville, Kentucky. The recipe was said to have been invented by a bartender at that club in honor of Colonel James E. Pepper, a prominent bourbon distiller, who brought it to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel bar in New York City.\n\nWith its conception rooted in the city's history, in 2015 the city of Louisville named the Old Fashioned as its official cocktail. Each year, during the first two weeks of June, Louisville celebrates \"Old Fashioned Fortnight\" which encompasses bourbon events, cocktail specials and National Bourbon Day which is always celebrated on June 14.\n\nGeorge Kappeler provides several of the earliest published recipes for Old Fashioned cocktails in his 1895 book. Recipes are given for Whiskey, Brandy, Holland gin, and Old Tom gin. The Whiskey Old Fashioned recipe specifies the following (with a jigger being ):\n\nBy the 1860s, as illustrated by Jerry Thomas' 1862 book, basic cocktail recipes included Curaçao, or other liqueurs. These liqueurs were not mentioned in the early 19th century descriptions, nor the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" descriptions of the \"Old Fashioned\" cocktails of the early 1880s; they were absent from Kappeler's Old Fashioned recipes as well. The differences of the Old Fashioned cocktail recipes from the cocktail recipes of the late 19th Century are mainly preparation method, the use of sugar and water in lieu of simple or gomme syrup, and the absence of additional liqueurs. These Old Fashioned cocktail recipes are literally for cocktails done the old-fashioned way.\n\nA book by David Embury published in 1948 provides a slight variation, specifying 12 parts American whiskey, 1 part simple syrup, 1-3 dashes Angostura bitters, a twist of lemon peel over the top, and serve garnished with the lemon peel.\n\nTwo additional recipes from the 1900s vary in the precise ingredients, but omit the cherry which was introduced after 1930 as well as the soda water which the occasional recipe calls for. Orange bitters were a popular ingredient in the late 19th century.\n\nThe original Old Fashioned recipe would have showcased the whiskey available in America in the 19th century: Irish, Bourbon or rye whiskey. But in some regions, especially Wisconsin, brandy is substituted for whiskey (sometimes called a Brandy Old Fashioned). Eventually the use of other spirits became common, such as a gin recipe becoming popularized in the late 1940s.\n\nCommon garnishes for an Old Fashioned include an orange slice or a maraschino cherry or both, although these modifications came around 1930, some time after the original recipe was invented. While some recipes began making sparse use of the orange zest for flavor, the practice of muddling orange and other fruit gained prevalence as late as the 1990s.\n\nAn example of an old fashioned-influenced cocktail is the American Trilogy. Barmen Richard Boccato and Michael McIlroy, created the American Trilogy in 2007 while bartending together at New York's Little Branch. This Old Fashioned-style cocktail follows the same bitters, sugar, whiskey and orange peel profile as the classic, but uses orange bitters, a brown sugar cube and one part applejack and one part rye whiskey. As the name implies, each ingredient of this three-part cocktail represents one pillar of the Trilogy. Laird's Bonded Applejack Brandy is the first and oldest distilled spirit in America with American rye whiskey following soon after in the late 1700s. The third pillar of this cocktail is somewhat of a mystery but according to creator Richard Boccato, is often thought to be the orange bitters because of its American origins. \n\nThe Old Fashioned is the cocktail of choice of Don Draper, the lead character on the \"Mad Men\" television series, set in the 1960s. The use of the drink in the series coincided with a renewed interest in this and other classic cocktails in the 2000s.\n\nIn the movie \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), pilot Tyler Fitzgerald (Jim Backus) directs passenger Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) to the aircraft's bar to \"make us some Old Fashioneds.\" Annoyed by suggestions that he should limit drinking while piloting an airplane, and finding Bell's Old Fashioneds too sweet, Fitzgerald turns the controls over to Bell's sidekick Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett) and retires to the back of the plane to \"make some Old Fashioneds the Old Fashioned way, the way dear old dad used to.\" When Benjamin asks what if something happens, Fitzgerald replies, \"What could happen to an Old Fashioned?\"\n\nIn the television series \"M*A*S*H\", character Margaret Houlihan frequently orders an Old Fashioned, \"without the fruit\", while in the Officers Club.\n\nIn the television series \"Grey's Anatomy\", in the fourth episode of the ninth season, Dr. Christina Yang and Dr. Thomas order two Old Fashioned in a bar after duty hours at The Clinic.\n\nIn the movie \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\", the Old Fashioned is the preferred cocktail of pickup artist Jacob Palmer, and he is shown drinking it both in the bar and at home.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23871", "title": "Pasta", "text": "Pasta\n\nPasta () is a staple food of Italian cuisine. Pasta is typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes, such as beans or lentils are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative.\n\nPastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (\"pasta secca\") and fresh (\"pasta fresca\"). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.\nBoth dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1300 documented names. In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form \"cavatelli\" is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.\nAs a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as \"pasta asciutta\" (or \"pastasciutta\"), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary side sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is \"pasta in brodo\", in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is \"pasta al forno\", in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.\nIn terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.\n\nFirst attested in English in 1874, the word \"pasta\" comes from Italian \"pasta\", in turn from Latin \"pasta\", latinisation of the Greek παστά (\"pasta\") \"barley porridge\".\n\nIn the 1st century AD writings of Horace, \"lagana\" (singular: \"laganum\") were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for \"lagana\" which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called \"lagana\" that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day \"lasagna\". However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape. The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.\n\nHistorians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd century AD Greek physician Galen mention \"itrion\", homogeneous compounds made of flour and water. The Jerusalem Talmud records that \"itrium\", a kind of boiled dough, was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD. A dictionary compiled by the 9th century Arab physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali defines \"itriyya\", the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. The geographical text of Muhammad al-Idrisi, compiled for the Norman King of Sicily Roger II in 1154 mentions \"itriyya\" manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily:\n\nOne form of \"itriyya\" with a long history is \"laganum\" (plural \"lagana\"), which in Latin refers to a thin sheet of dough, and gives rise to Italian \"lasagna\".\n\nIn North Africa, a food similar to pasta, known as couscous, has been eaten for centuries. However, it lacks the distinguishing malleable nature of pasta, couscous being more akin to droplets of dough. At first, dry pasta was a luxury item in Italy because of high labor costs; durum wheat semolina had to be kneaded for a long time.\n\nThere is a legend of Marco Polo importing pasta from China which originated with the \"Macaroni Journal\", published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting pasta in the United States. Rustichello da Pisa writes in his \"Travels\" that Marco Polo described a food similar to \"lagana\". Jeffrey Steingarten asserts that Arabs introduced pasta in the Emirate of Sicily in the ninth century, mentioning also that traces of pasta have been found in ancient Greece and that Jane Grigson believed the Marco Polo story to have originated in the 1920s or 30s in an advertisement for a Canadian spaghetti company.\n\nIn Greek mythology, it is believed that the god Hephaestus invented a device that made strings of dough. This was the earliest reference to a pasta maker.\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, dried pasta became popular for its easy storage. This allowed people to store pasta on ships when exploring the New World. A century later, pasta was present around the globe during the voyages of discovery.\n\nAlthough tomatoes were introduced to Italy in the 16th century and incorporated in Italian cuisine in the 17th century, description of the first Italian tomato sauces dates from the late 18th century: the first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook \"L'Apicio Moderno\" by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi. Before tomato sauce was introduced, pasta was eaten dry with the fingers; the liquid sauce demanded the use of a fork.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective. In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice. During the 1800s, water mills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market. In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824−1876) founded the first pasta factory of Hungary in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories of Central Europe. By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany became an established pasta manufacturer. During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called \"The Industry of Pasta\". In 1884, the Zátka Brothers’s plant in Boršov nad Vltavou was founded and this was the first Pasta factory of Bohemia.\n\nUsing tomato sauce to give pasta its flavour was revolutionary, since it was originally eaten plain. The consumption of pasta has changed over time; while once a small, simple item, it is now often eaten in much larger portions and as part of complex, sophisticated dishes. Factors such as low prices and ease of cooking contribute to the growing popularity of this staple item.\n\nThe art of pasta making and the devotion to the food as a whole has evolved since pasta was first conceptualized. It is estimated that Italians eat over of pasta per person, per year, easily beating Americans, who eat about per person. Pasta is so beloved in Italy that individual consumption exceeds the average production of wheat of the country; thus Italy frequently imports wheat for pasta making. In contemporary society pasta is ubiquitous and individuals can find a variety of types in local supermarkets. With the worldwide demand for this staple food, pasta is now largely mass-produced in factories and only a tiny proportion is crafted by hand.\n\nPasta was originally solely a part of Italian and European cuisine. With an increase in popularity on a worldwide scale, pasta has crossed international borders and is now a popular form of fast food and a staple in North America and elsewhere. This is due to the great amount of Italian immigration into Canada and the United States around the beginning of the 20th century. Similarly, an immense immigration of Italians into South Africa ensured that spaghetti with meatballs became an essential part of South African cuisine.\n\nSince at least the time of Cato's \"De Agri Cultura\", basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina, with durum wheat used predominantly in the South of Italy and soft wheat in the North. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours.\n\nTo address needs of people affected by gluten-related disorders (such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers), some recipes use rice or maize for making pasta. Grain flours may also be supplemented with cooked potatoes.\n\nOther additions to the basic flour-liquid mixture may include vegetable purees such as spinach or tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, spices and other seasonings. While pastas are, most typically, made from unleavened doughs, the use of yeast-raised doughs are also known for at least nine different pasta forms.\n\nAdditives in dried, commercially sold pasta include vitamins and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground. Micronutrients added may include niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate, thiamine (vitamin B1), and ferrous iron.\n\nFresh pasta is usually locally made with fresh ingredients unless it is destined to be shipped, in which case consideration is given to the spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or “00” low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.\n\nFresh pastas do not expand in size after cooking; therefore, of pasta are needed to serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is generally cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g. fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta is well known in the Piedmont region and Emilia Romagna region in North Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavour and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or cavatelli. Fresh pasta for cavatelli is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.\n\nDried pasta can also be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually produced in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. Dried pasta is mainly shipped over to farther locations and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavour and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to fresh pasta, dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes like ragu sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually grow to twice its original size. Therefore, approximately of dried pasta serves up to four people.\n\nPasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs, and \"white sauce\" is more common. However Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia Romagna. In Bologna, the meat-based \"Bolognese sauce\" incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called \"pesto\" originates from Genoa. In Central Italy, there are sauces such as \"tomato sauce\", \"amatriciana\", \"arrabbiata\" and the egg-based \"carbonara\".\nTomato sauces are also present in Southern Italian cuisine, where they originated. In Southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include \"puttanesca\", \"pasta alla norma\" (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese), \"pasta con le sarde\" (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), \"spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino\" (literally with garlic, [olive] oil and hot chili peppers).\n\nIngredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt and water. Flour is first mounded on a flat surface and then a well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour. There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti, and macaroni.\n\nKitchen pasta machines, also called pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make large amounts of fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand, and by turning a hand crank, rolls the pasta to thin it incrementally. On the final pass through the pasta machine, the pasta may be directed through a machine 'comb' to shape the pasta noodles as they emerge.\n\nSemolina flour consists of a protein matrix with entrapped starch granules. Upon the addition of water, during mixing, intermolecular forces allow the protein to form a more ordered structure in preparation for cooking.\n\nDurum wheat is ground into semolina flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour to move to a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency, the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.\n\nThe ingredients to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in some types of pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.\n\nThe dough is then ready to be shaped into different types of pasta. Depending on the type of pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time depending on the type of pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.\n\nGluten, the protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, spelt, and barley, contributes to protein aggregation and firm texture of a normally cooked pasta. Gluten-free pasta is produced with wheat flour substitutes, such as vegetable powders, rice, corn, quinoa, amaranth, oats and buckwheat flours. Other possible gluten-free pasta ingredients may include hydrocolloids to improve cooking pasta with high heat resistance, xanthan gum to retain moisture during storage, or hydrothermally-treated polysaccharide mixtures to produce textures similar to those of wheat pasta.\n\nThe storage of pasta depends its processing and extent of drying. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the cupboard for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. Cooked pasta may be frozen for up to two or three months. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.\n\nPasta exhibits a random molecular order rather than a crystalline structure. The moisture content of dried pasta is typically around 12%, indicating that dried pasta will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable. The cooked product is, as a result, softer, more flexible, and chewy.\n\nSemolina flour is the ground endosperm of durum wheat, producing granules that absorb water during heating and an increase in viscosity due to semi-reordering of starch molecules.\n\nAnother major component of durum wheat is protein which plays a large role in pasta dough rheology. Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 75–80%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.\n\nBefore the mixing process takes place, semolina particles are irregularly shaped and present in different sizes. Semolina particles become hydrated during mixing. The amount of water added to the semolina is determined based on the initial moisture content of the flour and the desired shape of the pasta. The desired moisture content of the dough is around 32% wet basis and will vary depending on the shape of pasta being produced.\n\nThe forming process involves the dough entering an extruder in which the rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape. As the starch granules swell slightly in the presence of water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.\n\nStarch gelatinization and protein coagulation are the major changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within the pasta cause a constant change in structure as the pasta cooks.\n\nIn 2011, the three largest producers of dried pasta were Italy (3.2 million tonnes), the United States (3 million tonnes), and Brazil (1.3 million tonnes). By 2016, Italy was still the largest producer of pasta in the world (3.4 million tonnes), followed by United States (2 million tonnes) and 3 countries in the one million tonnes range: Brazil, Turkey, and Russia. The largest per capita consumers of pasta in 2015 were Italy (23.5 kg/person), Tunisia (16.0 kg/person), Venezuela (12.0 kg/person) and Greece (11.2 kg/person). Nationally, the United States is the largest consumer of pasta with 2.7 million tons consumed in 2017.\n\nIn the European Union, total pasta sales in 2008 were US $8.361 billion, of which $5.722 billion was for dried pasta, $2.244 billion was for fresh or chilled pasta, and $395 million was for canned or preserved pasta. In 2009, retail sales of pasta represented a $2.8 billion market in Italy, $1.4 billion in Germany, and $1.2 billion in France.\n\nIn 2016, Italy was the world's largest exporter of pasta, with $2.8 billion sold, followed by China with $1.1 billion. The United States was the largest importer of pasta in 2016, with $1 billion acquired, followed by Germany and the UK.\n\nWhen cooked, plain pasta is composed of 62% water, 31% carbohydrates (26% starch), 6% protein, and 1% fat. A 100 gram portion of unenriched cooked pasta provides 160 Calories and a moderate level of manganese (15% of the Daily Value), but few other micronutrients.\n\nPasta has a lower glycemic index than many other staple foods in Western culture, like bread, potatoes, and rice.\n\nAs pasta was introduced elsewhere in the world, it became incorporated into a number of local cuisines, which often have significantly different ways of preparation from those of Italy. In Hong Kong, the local Chinese have adopted pasta, primarily spaghetti and macaroni, as an ingredient in the Hong Kong-style Western cuisine.\n\nWhen pasta was introduced to several nations, every culture adopted different style of preparing it. In the past, ancient Romans cooked pastas by frying or boiling it. It was also sweetened with honey or tossed with garum. Ancient Romans also enjoyed baking it in rich pies, called timballi.\n\nIn Cha chaan teng, macaroni is cooked in water and served in broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare. These affordable dining shops evolved from American food rations after World War II due to lack of supplies, and they continue to be popular for people with modest means.\nTwo common spaghetti dishes served in Japan are the Bolognese and the Napolitan. In Nepal, macaroni has been adopted and cooked in a Nepalese way. Boiled macaroni is sautéed along with cumin, turmeric, finely chopped green chillies, onions and cabbage. In Greece hilopittes is considered one of the finest types of dried egg pasta. It is cooked either in tomato sauce or with various kinds of casserole meat. It is usually served with Greek cheese of any type.\n\nPasta is also widespread in the Southern Cone, as well most of the rest of Brazil, mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where macaroni are called \"macarrão\", and more general pasta is under the umbrella term \"massa\", literally \"dough\", together with some Japanese noodles, such as \"bifum\" rice vermicelli and yakisoba, which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as ñoquis/nhoque for gnocchi, ravioles/ravióli for ravioli, or tallarines/talharim for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the \"parafuso\" (\"screw\", \"bolt\"), a specialty of the country's pasta salads, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the fusilli.\n\nIn Sweden, spaghetti is traditionally served with \"köttfärssås\" (Bolognese sauce), which is minced meat in a thick tomato soup.\n\nIn the Philippines, spaghetti is often served with a distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base of which would be tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano sprigs and sometimes with dried bay leaf, and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in \"sopas\", a local chicken broth soup.\n\n\"Fettuccine alfredo\" with cream, cheese and butter, and spaghetti with tomato sauce (with or without meat) are popular Italian-style dishes in the United States.\n\nIn Australia, boscaiola sauce, based on bacon and mushrooms, is one favorite among many.\n\nAlthough numerous variations of ingredients for different pasta products are known, in Italy the commercial manufacturing and labeling of pasta for sale as a food product within the country is highly regulated. Italian regulations recognise three categories of commercially manufactured dried pasta as well as manufactured fresh and stabilized pasta:\n\nPasta, or dried pasta with three subcategories – (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (\"pasta di semola di grano duro\"), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta (\"pasta di semolato di grano duro\") and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (\"pasta di semola integrale di grano duro\"). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.\n\nSpecial pastas (\"paste speciali\") – As Pasta above, with additional ingredients other than flour and water or eggs. Special pastas must be labeled as durum wheat semolina pasta on the packaging completed by mentioning the added ingredients used (e.g., spinach). The 3% soft flour limitation still applies.\n\nEgg pasta (\"pasta all'uovo\") – May only be manufactured using durum wheat semolina with at least 4 hens’ eggs (chicken) weighing at least 200 grams (without the shells) per kilogram of semolina, or a liquid egg product produced only with hen’s eggs. Pasta made and sold in Italy under this category must be labeled egg pasta.\nFresh and stabilized pastas (\"paste alimentari fresche e stabilizzate\") – Includes fresh and stabilized pastas, which may be made with soft-wheat flour without restriction on the amount. Prepackaged fresh pasta must have a water content not less than 24%, must be stored refrigerated at a temperature of not more than 4 °C (with a 2 °C tolerance), must have undergone a heat treatment at least equivalent to pasteurisation, and must be sold within 5 days of the date of manufacture. Stabilized pasta has a lower allowed water content of 20%, and is manufactured using a process and heat treatment that allows it to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures.\n\nThe Italian regulations under Presidential Decree N° 187 apply only to the commercial manufacturing of pastas both made and sold within Italy. They are not applicable either to pasta made for export from Italy or to pastas imported into Italy from other countries. They also do not apply to pastas made in restaurants.\n\nIn the US, regulations for commercial pasta products occur both at the federal and state levels. At the Federal level, consistent with Section 341 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined standards of identity for what are broadly termed \"macaroni products\". These standards appear in 21 CFR Part 139. Those regulations state the requirements for standardized \"macaroni products\" of 15 specific types of dried pastas, including the ingredients and product-specific labeling for conforming products sold in the US, including imports:\n\nMacaroni products – defined as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including egg white, frozen egg white or dried egg white alone or in any combination; disodium phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.\n\nNoodle products – the class of food that is prepared by drying units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, alone or in any combination with liquid eggs, frozen eggs, dried eggs, egg yolks, frozen yolks, dried yolks, alone or in any combination, with or without water. Optional ingredients that may be added in allowed amounts are onions, celery, garlic, and bay leaf; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate.\n\nIt is important to note that the federal regulations under 21 CFR Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA’s standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut’s law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain grain products, including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.\n\nBeyond the FDA’s standards and state statutes, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which regulates federal school nutrition programs, broadly requires grain and bread products served under these programs either be enriched or whole grain (see 7 CFR 210.10 (k) (5)). This includes macaroni and noodle products that are served as part the category grains/breads requirements within those programs. The USDA also allows that enriched macaroni products fortified with protein may be used and counted to meet either a grains/breads or meat/alternative meat requirement, but not as both components within the same meal.\n\n"}
{"id": "24147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24147", "title": "Palindrome", "text": "Palindrome\n\nA palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\" or the number \"10801.\" Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\", \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\" or \"No 'x' in Nixon\".\n\nComposing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing.\n\nThe word \"palindrome\" was coined by the English playwright Ben Jonson in the 17th century from the Greek roots ' (; \"again\") and ' (; \"way, direction\").\n\nPalindromes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, a city buried by ash in that year. This palindrome, called the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: \"Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas\" (\"The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels\"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic. \n\nA palindrome with the same square property is the Hebrew palindrome, \"We explained the glutton who is in the honey was burned and incinerated\", (פרשנו רעבתן שבדבש נתבער ונשרף; \"perashnu: ra`avtan shebad'vash nitba`er venisraf\"), credited to Abraham ibn Ezra in 1924, and referring to the halachic question as to whether a fly landing in honey makes the honey \"treif\" (non-kosher).\n\nThe palindromic Latin riddle \"\"In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni\"\" (\"we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire\") describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled \"gyrum\".\n\nByzantine Greeks often inscribed the palindrome, \"Wash [the] sins, not only [the] face\" (\"\"Nipson anomēmata mē monan opsin\"\", engraving \"\"ps\"\" with the single Greek letter Ψ, psi), on baptismal fonts; a variant, also a palindrome, replaces the plural (\"sins\") by the singular (\"sin\"). This practice was continued in many English churches. Examples include the font at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham and also the font in the basilica of St. Sophia, Constantinople, the font of St. Stephen d'Egres, Paris; at St. Menin's Abbey, Orléans; at Dulwich College; and at the following churches: Worlingworth (Suffolk), Harlow (Essex), Knapton (Norfolk), St Martin, Ludgate (London), and Hadleigh (Suffolk).\n\nSome well-known English palindromes are, \"Able was I ere I saw Elba\", \"A man, a plan, a canal – Panama\", \"Madam, I'm Adam\" and \"Never odd or even\".\n\nEnglish palindromes of notable length include mathematician Peter Hilton's \"Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod\" and Scottish poet Alastair Reid's \"T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad; I'd assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.\"\n\nThe most familiar palindromes in English are character-unit palindromes. The characters read the same backward as forward. Some examples of palindromic words are \"redivider\", \"deified\", \"civic\", \"radar\", \"level\", \"rotor\", \"kayak\", \"reviver\", \"racecar\", \"redder\", \"madam\", and \"refer\".\n\nThere are also word-unit palindromes in which the unit of reversal is the word (\"Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?\"). Word-unit palindromes were made popular in the [[Logology|recreational linguistics]] community by [[J. A. Lindon]] in the 1960s. Occasional examples in English were created in the 19th century. Several in French and Latin date to the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThere are also line-unit palindromes.\n\nPalindromes often consist of a sentence or phrase, e.g., \"Mr. Owl ate my metal worm\", \"Was it a car or a cat I saw?\", \"Murder for a jar of red rum\" or \"Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog\". Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored. Some, such as \"Rats live on no evil star\", \"Live on time, emit no evil\", and \"Step on no pets\", include the spaces.\n\nSemordnilap (palindromes spelled backward) is a name coined for words that spell a different word in reverse. The word was coined by [[Martin Gardner]] in his notes to C.C. Bombaugh's book \"Oddities and Curiosities of Words and Literature\" in 1961. \n\nAn example of this is the word \"stressed\", which is \"desserts\" spelled backward.\n\nSome semordnilaps are deliberate creations. An example in electronics (although rarely used now) is the [[mho]], a unit of electrical conductance, which is [[ohm]] spelled backwards, the unit of [[electrical resistance]] and the reciprocal of conductance. Similarly, the [[daraf]], a unit of [[elastance]], is [[farad]] spelled backwards, the unit of [[capacitance]] and the reciprocal of elastance. In fiction, many characters have names deliberately made to be semordnilaps of other names or words, the most widely used of which is [[Alucard (disambiguation)|Alucard]] (a semordnilap of \"[[Dracula]]\").\n\nSemordnilaps are also known as emordnilaps, word reversals, [[Anagram|reversible anagrams]], heteropalindromes, semi-palindromes, half-palindromes, reversgrams, mynoretehs, volvograms, or anadromes. They have also sometimes been called antigrams, though this term usually refers to [[anagram]]s which have opposite meanings. In 2017, a six-year-old Canadian named Levi Budd called this a levidrome, which garnered support into making it a word from celebrities [[William Shatner]] and [[Patricia Arquette]] As of October 2018, none of these terms have been accepted as official entries in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].\n\nSome names are palindromes, such as the [[given name]]s Hannah, Ada, Anna, Bob, Nitin and Otto, or the [[surname]]s Harrah, Renner, Salas and Nenonen.\n[[Lon Nol]] (1913–1985) was Prime Minister of Cambodia. [[Nisio Isin]] is a Japanese novelist and [[manga]] writer, whose pseudonym (西尾 維新, \"Nishio Ishin\") is a palindrome when romanized using the [[Kunrei-shiki]] or the [[Nihon-shiki]] systems, and is often written as NisiOisiN to emphasize this. Some people have changed their name in order to make of it a palindrome (such as actor [[Robert Trebor]] and rock-vocalist [[Ola Salo]]), while others were given a palindromic name at birth (such as the philologist [[Revilo P. Oliver]] or the flamenco dancer [[Sara Baras]]).\n\nThere are also palindromic names in fictional media. \"Stanley Yelnats\" is the name of the main character in \"[[Holes (novel)|Holes]]\", a 1998 novel and [[Holes (film)|2003 film]]. Four of the fictional \"[[Pokémon]]\" [[List of Pokémon|species]] have palindromic names in English ([[Eevee]], Girafarig, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola).\n\nThe 1970s pop band [[ABBA]] is a palindrome using the starting letter of the first name of each of the four band members.\n\nA palindromic number is a number whose digits, with [[decimal]] representation usually assumed, are the same read backward, for example, 5885. They are studied in [[recreational mathematics]] where palindromic numbers with special properties are sought. A [[palindromic prime]] is a palindromic number that is a [[prime number]], for example, 191 and 313.\n\nThe [[continued fraction]] of + ⌊⌋ is a repeating palindrome when \"n\" is an integer, where essentially, for any positive \"x\", ⌊\"x\"⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integer part]] of \"x\".\n\nThe question of whether [[Lychrel number]]s exist is an unsolved problem in mathematics about whether all numbers become palindromes when they are continuously reversed and added. For example, 56 is not a Lychrel number as 56 + 65 = 121, and 121 is a palindrome. The number 59 becomes a palindrome after three iterations: 59 + 95 = 154; 154 + 451 = 605; 605 + 506 = 1111, so 59 is not a Lychrel number either. Numbers such as 196 are thought to never become palindromes when this reversal process is carried out and are therefore suspected to be Lychrel numbers. If a number is not a Lychrel number, it is called a \"delayed palindrome\" (56 has a delay of 1 and 59 has a delay of 3). In January 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as [[oeis:A281509|A281509]], and described as \"The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome\", with a delay of 261. Several smaller 261-delay palindromes were published separately as [[oeis:A281508|A281508]].\n\nRemarkably, a 2018 paper has demonstrated that every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.\n\nA phonetic palindrome is a portion of [[Speech communication|speech]] that is identical or roughly identical when reversed. It can arise in context where language is played with, for example in slang dialects like \"[[verlan]]\". In French, there is the phrase \"une Slave valse nue\" (\"a Slavic woman waltzes naked\"), phonemically . [[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] discussed his experience of phonetic palindromes while working on audio tape versions of the [[cut-up technique]] using recorded readings by [[William S. Burroughs]]. A list of phonetic palindromes discussed by [[word puzzle]] columnist O.V. Michaelson include \"crew work\"/\"work crew\", \"dry yard\", \"easy\", \"Funny enough\", \"Let Bob tell\", \"new moon\", \"selfless\", \"Sorry, Ross\", \"Talk, Scott\", \"to boot\", \"top spot\" (also an orthographic palindrome), \"Y'all lie\", \"You're caught. Talk, Roy\", and \"You're damn mad, Roy\".\n\n[[File:Berg lulu palindrome mirror point.png|thumb|Center part of palindrome in Alban Berg's opera \"Lulu\"]]\n[[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 47 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 47]] in G is nicknamed \"the Palindrome\". The third movement, [[minuet]] and [[trio (music)|trio]] is a musical palindrome. The second half of the piece is the same as the first but backwards.\n\nThe interlude from [[Alban Berg]]'s opera \"[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]\" is a palindrome, as are sections and pieces, in [[arch form]], by many other composers, including [[James Tenney]], and most famously [[Béla Bartók]]. [[George Crumb]] also used musical palindrome to text paint the [[Federico García Lorca]] poem \"¿Por qué nací?\", the first movement of three in his fourth book of [[Madrigal (music)|Madrigals]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s final composition, \"The Owl and the Pussy Cat\", is a palindrome.\n\nThe first movement from [[Constant Lambert]]'s [[ballet]] \"[[Horoscope (ballet)|Horoscope]]\" (1938) is entitled \"Palindromic Prelude\". Lambert claimed that the theme was dictated to him by the ghost of [[Bernard van Dieren]], who had died in 1936.\n\nBritish composer [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]] also composed music in the palindrome or based on palindromic themes; the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Simpson)|Symphony No. 2]] is a palindrome, as is the slow movement of his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Simpson)|String Quartet No. 1]]. His hour-long [[String Quartet No. 9 (Simpson)|String Quartet No. 9]] consists of thirty-two variations and a fugue on a palindromic theme of Haydn (from the minuet of his Symphony No. 47). All of Simpson's thirty-two variations are themselves palindromic.\n\n\"Hin und Zurück\" (\"There and Back\": 1927) is an operatic 'sketch' (Op. 45a) in one scene by Paul Hindemith, with a German libretto by Marcellus Schiffer. It is essentially a dramatic palindrome. Through the first half, a tragedy unfolds between two lovers, involving jealousy, murder and suicide. Then, in the reversing second half, this is replayed with the lines sung in reverse order to produce a happy ending.\n\nThe music of [[Anton Webern]] is often palindromic. Webern, who had studied the music of the Renaissance composer [[Heinrich Isaac]], was extremely interested in symmetries in music, be they horizontal or vertical. An example of horizontal or linear symmetry in Webern's music is the first phrase in the second movement of the [[symphony]], Op. 21. A striking example of vertical symmetry is the second movement of the [[Variations for piano (Webern)|Piano Variations]], Op. 27, in which Webern arranges every pitch of this [[dodecaphonic]] work around the central pitch axis of A4. From this, each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction. For example, a G3—13 half-steps down from A4 is replicated as a B5—13 half-steps above.\n\nJust as the letters of a verbal palindrome are not reversed, so are the elements of a musical palindrome usually presented in the same form in both halves. Although these elements are usually single notes, palindromes may be made using more complex elements. For example, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s composition \"[[Mixtur]]\", originally written in 1964, consists of twenty sections, called \"moments\", which may be [[Permutation|permuted]] in several different ways, including retrograde presentation, and two versions may be made in a single program. When the composer revised the work in 2003, he prescribed such a palindromic performance, with the twenty moments first played in a \"forwards\" version, and then \"backwards\". Each moment, however, is a complex musical unit, and is played in the same direction in each half of the program. By contrast, [[Karel Goeyvaerts]]'s 1953 electronic composition, \"[[Nummer 5]] (met zuivere tonen)\" is an \"exact\" palindrome: not only does each event in the second half of the piece occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa. It is a perfect example of Goeyvaerts's aesthetics, the perfect example of the imperfection of perfection.\n\nIn [[classical music]], a [[crab canon]] is a [[canon (music)|canon]] in which one line of the melody is reversed in time and pitch from the other.\nA large-scale musical palindrome covering more than one movement is called \"chiasic\", referring to the cross-shaped Greek letter \"[[Chi (letter)|χ]]\" (pronounced /ˈkaɪ/.) This is usually a form of reference to the crucifixion; for example, the \"\" movement of Bach's [[Mass in B minor]]. The purpose of such palindromic balancing is to focus the listener on the central movement, much as one would focus on the center of the cross in the crucifixion. Other examples are found in Bach's cantata BWV 4, \"[[Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4|Christ lag in Todes Banden]]\", Handel's \"[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]\" and Fauré's [[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]].\n\nA [[table canon]] is a rectangular piece of sheet music intended to be played by two musicians facing each other across a table with the music between them, with one musician viewing the music upside down compared to the other. The result is somewhat like two speakers simultaneously reading the [[Sator square]] from opposite sides, except that it is typically in two-part polyphony rather than in unison.\n\nThe longest palindromic word in the \"[[Oxford English Dictionary]]\" is the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] \"tattarrattat\", coined by [[James Joyce]] in \"[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]\" (1922) for a knock on the door. The \"Guinness Book of Records\" gives the title to \"detartrated\", the [[preterite]] and past participle of \"detartrate\", a chemical term meaning to remove [[tartrate]]s. [[Rotary tiller|Rotavator]], a trademarked name for an agricultural machine, is often listed in dictionaries. The term \"redivider\" is used by some writers, but appears to be an invented or derived term—only \"redivide\" and \"redivision\" appear in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. \"[[Malayalam]]\", a language of southern India, is of equal length.\n\nIn English, two palindromic novels have been published: \"Satire: Veritas\" by David Stephens (1980, 58,795 letters), and \"Dr Awkward & Olson in Oslo\" by Lawrence Levine (1986, 31,954 words). What is better known is the 224-word long poem \"Dammit I'm Mad\" by [[Demetri Martin]].\n\nAccording to [[Guinness World Records]], the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] 19-letter word \"saippuakivikauppias\" (a [[soapstone]] vendor), is the world's longest palindromic word in everyday use.\n\n[[File:DNA palindrome.svg|thumb|600px|right|Palindrome of [[DNA structure]]A: Palindrome, B: Loop, C: Stem]]\nIn most [[genome]]s or sets of [[gene]]tic instructions, palindromic motifs are found. The meaning of palindrome in the context of genetics is slightly different, however, from the definition used for words and sentences. Since the [[DNA]] is formed by two paired strands of [[nucleotides]], and the nucleotides always pair in the same way ([[Adenine]] (A) with [[Thymine]] (T), [[Cytosine]] (C) with [[Guanine]] (G)), a (single-stranded) sequence of DNA is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its complementary sequence read backward. For example, the sequence ACCTAGGT is palindromic because its complement is TGGATCCA, which is equal to the original sequence in reverse complement.\n\nA palindromic [[DNA]] sequence may form a [[stem-loop|hairpin]]. Palindromic motifs are made by the order of the [[nucleotide]]s that specify the complex chemicals ([[protein]]s) that, as a result of those [[genetics|genetic]] instructions, the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is to produce. They have been specially researched in [[bacteria]]l chromosomes and in the so-called Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Elements (BIMEs) scattered over them. Recently a research genome sequencing project discovered that many of the bases on the [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] are arranged as palindromes. A palindrome structure allows the Y-chromosome to repair itself by bending over at the middle if one side is damaged.\n\nIt is believed that palindromes frequently are also found in proteins, but their role in the protein function is not clearly known. It has recently been suggested that the prevalence existence of palindromes in peptides might be related to the prevalence of low-complexity regions in proteins, as palindromes frequently are associated with low-complexity sequences. Their prevalence might also be related to an [[alpha helical]] formation propensity of these sequences, or in formation of proteins/protein complexes.\n\nIn [[automata theory]], a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all palindromes in a given [[alphabet]] is a typical example of a [[formal language|language]] that is [[context-free language|context-free]], but not [[Regular language|regular]]. This means that it is impossible for a [[finite automaton|computer with a finite amount of memory]] to reliably test for palindromes. (For practical purposes with modern computers, this limitation would apply only to impractically long letter-sequences.)\n\nIn addition, the set of palindromes may not be reliably tested by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] which also means that they are not [[LR parser|LR(k)-parsable]] or [[LL parser|LL(k)-parsable]]. When reading a palindrome from left-to-right, it is, in essence, impossible to locate the \"middle\" until the entire word has been read completely.\n\nIt is possible to find the [[longest palindromic substring]] of a given input string in [[linear time]].\n\nThe palindromic density of an infinite word \"w\" over an alphabet \"A\" is defined to be zero if only finitely many prefixes are palindromes; otherwise, letting the palindromic prefixes be of lengths \"n\" for \"k\"=1,2... we define the density to be\n\nAmong aperiodic words, the largest possible palindromic density is achieved by the [[Fibonacci word]], which has density 1/φ, where φ is the [[Golden ratio]].\n\nA palstar is a [[concatenation]] of palindromic strings, excluding the trivial one-letter palindromes – otherwise all strings would be palstars.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Palindromes| ]]"}
{"id": "24304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24304", "title": "Password", "text": "Password\n\nA password is a word or string of characters used for user authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource (example: an access code is a type of password), which is to be kept secret from those not allowed access.\n\nThe use of passwords is known to be ancient. Sentries would challenge those wishing to enter an area or approaching it to supply a password or \"watchword\", and would only allow a person or group to pass if they knew the password. In modern times, user names and passwords are commonly used by people during a log in process that controls access to protected computer operating systems, mobile phones, cable TV decoders, automated teller machines (ATMs), etc. A typical computer user has passwords for many purposes: logging into accounts, retrieving e-mail, accessing applications, databases, networks, web sites, and even reading the morning newspaper online.\n\nDespite the name, there is no need for passwords to be actual words; indeed passwords which are not actual words may be harder to guess, a desirable property. Some passwords are formed from multiple words and may more accurately be called a passphrase. The terms passcode and passkey are sometimes used when the secret information is purely numeric, such as the personal identification number (PIN) commonly used for ATM access. Passwords are generally short enough to be easily memorized and typed, although they may be longer and more complex if the user wishes to be more secure.\n\nMost organizations specify a password policy that sets requirements for the composition and usage of passwords, typically dictating minimum length, required categories (e.g. upper and lower case, numbers, and special characters), prohibited elements (e.g. own name, date of birth, address, telephone number). Some governments have national authentication frameworks that define requirements for user authentication to government services, including requirements for passwords.\n\nPasswords or \"watchwords\" have been used since ancient times. Polybius describes the system for the distribution of watchwords in the Roman military as follows:\n\nThe way in which they secure the passing round of the watchword for the night is as follows: from the tenth maniple of each class of infantry and cavalry, the maniple which is encamped at the lower end of the street, a man is chosen who is relieved from guard duty, and he attends every day at sunset at the tent of the tribune, and receiving from him the watchword—that is a wooden tablet with the word inscribed on it – takes his leave, and on returning to his quarters passes on the watchword and tablet before witnesses to the commander of the next maniple, who in turn passes it to the one next him. All do the same until it reaches the first maniples, those encamped near the tents of the tribunes. These latter are obliged to deliver the tablet to the tribunes before dark. So that if all those issued are returned, the tribune knows that the watchword has been given to all the maniples, and has passed through all on its way back to him. If any one of them is missing, he makes inquiry at once, as he knows by the marks from what quarter the tablet has not returned, and whoever is responsible for the stoppage meets with the punishment he merits.\n\nPasswords in military use evolved to include not just a password, but a password and a counterpassword; for example in the opening days of the Battle of Normandy, paratroopers of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division used a password—\"flash\"—which was presented as a challenge, and answered with the correct response—\"thunder\". The challenge and response were changed every three days. American paratroopers also famously used a device known as a \"cricket\" on D-Day in place of a password system as a temporarily unique method of identification; one metallic click given by the device in lieu of a password was to be met by two clicks in reply.\n\nPasswords have been used with computers since the earliest days of computing. The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), an operating system introduced at MIT in 1961, was the first computer system to implement password login. CTSS had a LOGIN command that requested a user password. \"After typing PASSWORD, the system turns off the printing mechanism, if possible, so that the user may type in his password with privacy.\" In the early 1970s, Robert Morris developed a system of storing login passwords in a hashed form as part of the Unix operating system. The system was based on a simulated Hagelin rotor crypto machine, and first appeared in 6th Edition Unix in 1974. A later version of his algorithm, known as crypt(3), used a 12-bit salt and invoked a modified form of the DES algorithm 25 times to reduce the risk of pre-computed dictionary attacks.\n\nThe easier a password is for the owner to remember generally means it will be easier for an attacker to guess. However, passwords which are difficult to remember may also reduce the security of a system because (a) users might need to write down or electronically store the password, (b) users will need frequent password resets and (c) users are more likely to re-use the same password. Similarly, the more stringent requirements for password strength, e.g. \"have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and digits\" or \"change it monthly\", the greater the degree to which users will subvert the system. Others argue longer passwords provide more security (e.g., entropy) than shorter passwords with a wide variety of characters.\n\nIn \"The Memorability and Security of Passwords\", Jeff Yan et al. examine the effect of advice given to users about a good choice of password. They found that passwords based on thinking of a phrase and taking the first letter of each word are just as memorable as naively selected passwords, and just as hard to crack as randomly generated passwords.\n\nCombining two or more unrelated words and altering some of the letters to special characters or numbers is another good method, but a single dictionary word is not. Having a personally designed algorithm for generating obscure passwords is another good method.\n\nHowever, asking users to remember a password consisting of a \"mix of uppercase and lowercase characters\" is similar to asking them to remember a sequence of bits: hard to remember, and only a little bit harder to crack (e.g. only 128 times harder to crack for 7-letter passwords, less if the user simply capitalises one of the letters). Asking users to use \"both letters and digits\" will often lead to easy-to-guess substitutions such as 'E' → '3' and 'I' → '1', substitutions which are well known to attackers. Similarly typing the password one keyboard row higher is a common trick known to attackers.\n\nIn 2013, Google released a list of the most common password types, all of which are considered insecure because they are too easy to guess (especially after researching an individual on social media):\n\nThe security of a password-protected system depends on several factors. The overall system must be designed for sound security, with protection against computer viruses, man-in-the-middle attacks and the like. Physical security issues are also a concern, from deterring shoulder surfing to more sophisticated physical threats such as video cameras and keyboard sniffers. Passwords should be chosen so that they are hard for an attacker to guess and hard for an attacker to discover using any of the available automatic attack schemes. See password strength and computer security for more information.\n\nNowadays, it is a common practice for computer systems to hide passwords as they are typed. The purpose of this measure is to prevent bystanders from reading the password; however, some argue that this practice may lead to mistakes and stress, encouraging users to choose weak passwords. As an alternative, users should have the option to show or hide passwords as they type them.\n\nEffective access control provisions may force extreme measures on criminals seeking to acquire a password or biometric token. Less extreme measures include extortion, rubber hose cryptanalysis, and side channel attack.\n\nSome specific password management issues that must be considered when thinking about, choosing, and handling, a password follow.\n\nThe rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g., three) of failed password entry attempts. In the absence of other vulnerabilities, such systems can be effectively secure with relatively simple passwords, if they have been well chosen and are not easily guessed.\n\nMany systems store a cryptographic hash of the password. If an attacker gets access to the file of hashed passwords guessing can be done offline, rapidly testing candidate passwords against the true password's hash value. In the example of a web-server, an online attacker can guess only at the rate at which the server will respond, while an off-line attacker (who gains access to the file) can guess at a rate limited only by the hardware on which the attack is running.\n\nPasswords that are used to generate cryptographic keys (e.g., for disk encryption or Wi-Fi security) can also be subjected to high rate guessing. Lists of common passwords are widely available and can make password attacks very efficient. (See Password cracking.) Security in such situations depends on using passwords or passphrases of adequate complexity, making such an attack computationally infeasible for the attacker. Some systems, such as PGP and Wi-Fi WPA, apply a computation-intensive hash to the password to slow such attacks. See key stretching.\n\nAn alternative to limiting the rate at which an attacker can make guesses on a password is to limit the total number of guesses that can be made. The password can be disabled, requiring a reset, after a\nsmall number of consecutive bad guesses (say 5); and the user may be required to change the password after a larger cumulative number of bad guesses (say 30), to prevent an attacker from making an arbitrarily large number of bad guesses by interspersing them between good guesses made by the legitimate password owner. Attackers may conversely use knowledge of this mitigation to implement a denial of service attack against the user by intentionally locking the user out of their own device; this denial of service may open other avenues for the attacker to manipulate the situation to their advantage via social engineering.\n\nSome computer systems store user passwords as plaintext, against which to compare user log on attempts. If an attacker gains access to such an internal password store, all passwords—and so all user accounts—will be compromised. If some users employ the same password for accounts on different systems, those will be compromised as well.\n\nMore secure systems store each password in a cryptographically protected form, so access to the actual password will still be difficult for a snooper who gains internal access to the system, while validation of user access attempts remains possible. The most secure don't store passwords at all, but a one-way derivation, such as a polynomial, modulus, or an advanced hash function.\nRoger Needham invented the now common approach of storing only a \"hashed\" form of the plaintext password. When a user types in a password on such a system, the password handling software runs through a cryptographic hash algorithm, and if the hash value generated from the user's entry matches the hash stored in the password database, the user is permitted access. The hash value is created by applying a cryptographic hash function to a string consisting of the submitted password and, in many implementations, another value known as a salt. A salt prevents attackers from easily building a list of hash values for common passwords and prevents password cracking efforts from scaling across all users. MD5 and SHA1 are frequently used cryptographic hash functions but they are not recommended for password hashing unless they are used as part of a larger construction such as in PBKDF2.\n\nThe stored data—sometimes called the \"password verifier\" or the \"password hash\"—is often stored in Modular Crypt Format or RFC 2307 hash format, sometimes in the /etc/passwd file or the /etc/shadow file.\n\nThe main storage methods for passwords are plain text, hashed, hashed and salted, and reversibly encrypted. If an attacker gains access to the password file, then if it is stored as plain text, no cracking is necessary. If it is hashed but not salted then it is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks (which are more efficient than cracking). If it is reversibly encrypted then if the attacker gets the decryption key along with the file no cracking is necessary, while if he fails to get the key cracking is not possible. Thus, of the common storage formats for passwords only when passwords have been salted and hashed is cracking both necessary and possible.\n\nIf a cryptographic hash function is well designed, it is computationally infeasible to reverse the function to recover a plaintext password. An attacker can, however, use widely available tools to attempt to guess the passwords. These tools work by hashing possible passwords and comparing the result of each guess to the actual password hashes. If the attacker finds a match, they know that their guess is the actual password for the associated user.\nPassword cracking tools can operate by brute force (i.e. trying every possible combination of characters) or by hashing every word from a list; large lists of possible passwords in many languages are widely available on the Internet. The existence of password cracking tools allows attackers to easily recover poorly chosen passwords. In particular, attackers can quickly recover passwords that are short, dictionary words, simple variations on dictionary words or that use easily guessable patterns.\nA modified version of the DES algorithm was used as the basis for the password hashing algorithm in early Unix systems. The crypt algorithm used a 12-bit salt value so that each user's hash was unique and iterated the DES algorithm 25 times in order to make the hash function slower, both measures intended to frustrate automated guessing attacks. The user's password was used as a key to encrypt a fixed value. More recent Unix or Unix like systems (e.g., Linux or the various BSD systems) use more secure password hashing algorithms such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, and scrypt which have large salts and an adjustable cost or number of iterations.\nA poorly designed hash function can make attacks feasible even if a strong password is chosen. See LM hash for a widely deployed, and insecure, example.\n\nPasswords are vulnerable to interception (i.e., \"snooping\") while being transmitted to the authenticating machine or person. If the password is carried as electrical signals on unsecured physical wiring between the user access point and the central system controlling the password database, it is subject to snooping by wiretapping methods. If it is carried as packeted data over the Internet, anyone able to watch the packets containing the logon information can snoop with a very low probability of detection.\n\nEmail is sometimes used to distribute passwords but this is generally an insecure method. Since most email is sent as plaintext, a message containing a password is readable without effort during transport by any eavesdropper. Further, the message will be stored as plaintext on at least two computers: the sender's and the recipient's. If it passes through intermediate systems during its travels, it will probably be stored on there as well, at least for some time, and may be copied to backup, cache or history files on any of these systems.\n\nUsing client-side encryption will only protect transmission from the mail handling system server to the client machine. Previous or subsequent relays of the email will not be protected and the email will probably be stored on multiple computers, certainly on the originating and receiving computers, most often in clear text.\n\nThe risk of interception of passwords sent over the Internet can be reduced by, among other approaches, using cryptographic protection. The most widely used is the Transport Layer Security (TLS, previously called SSL) feature built into most current Internet browsers. Most browsers alert the user of a TLS/SSL protected exchange with a server by displaying a closed lock icon, or some other sign, when TLS is in use. There are several other techniques in use; see cryptography.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a conflict between stored hashed-passwords and hash-based challenge-response authentication; the latter requires a client to prove to a server that they know what the shared secret (i.e., password) is, and to do this, the server must be able to obtain the shared secret from its stored form. On many systems (including Unix-type systems) doing remote authentication, the shared secret usually becomes the hashed form and has the serious limitation of exposing passwords to offline guessing attacks. In addition, when the hash is used as a shared secret, an attacker does not need the original password to authenticate remotely; they only need the hash.\n\nRather than transmitting a password, or transmitting the hash of the password, password-authenticated key agreement systems can perform a zero-knowledge password proof, which proves knowledge of the password without exposing it.\n\nMoving a step further, augmented systems for password-authenticated key agreement (e.g., AMP, B-SPEKE, PAK-Z, SRP-6) avoid both the conflict and limitation of hash-based methods. An augmented system allows a client to prove knowledge of the password to a server, where the server knows only a (not exactly) hashed password, and where the unhashed password is required to gain access.\n\nUsually, a system must provide a way to change a password, either because a user believes the current password has been (or might have been) compromised, or as a precautionary measure. If a new password is passed to the system in unencrypted form, security can be lost (e.g., via wiretapping) before the new password can even be installed in the password database and if the new password is given to a compromised employee, little is gained. Some web sites include the user-selected password in an unencrypted confirmation e-mail message, with the obvious increased vulnerability.\n\nIdentity management systems are increasingly used to automate issuance of replacements for lost passwords, a feature called self service password reset. The user's identity is verified by asking questions and comparing the answers to ones previously stored (i.e., when the account was opened).\n\nSome password reset questions ask for personal information that could be found on social media, such as mother's maiden name. As a result, some security experts recommend either making up one's own questions or giving false answers.\n\n\"Password aging\" is a feature of some operating systems which forces users to change passwords frequently (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even more often). Such policies usually provoke user protest and foot-dragging at best and hostility at worst. There is often an increase in the people who note down the password and leave it where it can easily be found, as well as helpdesk calls to reset a forgotten password. Users may use simpler passwords or develop variation patterns on a consistent theme to keep their passwords memorable. Because of these issues, there is some debate as to whether password aging is effective. Changing a password will not prevent abuse in most cases, since the abuse would often be immediately noticeable. However, if someone may have had access to the password through some means, such as sharing a computer or breaching a different site, changing the password limits the window for abuse.\n\n Single passwords are also much less convenient to change because many people need to be told at the same time, and they make removal of a particular user's access more difficult, as for instance on graduation or resignation. Separate logins are also often used for accountability, for example to know who changed a piece of data.\n\nCommon techniques used to improve the security of computer systems protected by a password include:\n\nSome of the more stringent policy enforcement measures can pose a risk of alienating users, possibly decreasing security as a result.\n\nIt is common practice amongst computer users to reuse the same password on multiple sites. This presents a substantial security risk, since an attacker need only compromise a single site in order to gain access to other sites the victim uses. This problem is exacerbated by also reusing usernames, and by websites requiring email logins, as it makes it easier for an attacker to track a single user across multiple sites. Password reuse can be avoided or minimused by using mnemonic techniques, writing passwords down on paper, or using a password manager.\n\nIt has been argued by Redmond researchers Dinei Florencio and Cormac Herley, together with Paul C. van Oorschot of Carleton University, Canada, that password reuse is inevitable, and that users should reuse passwords for low-security websites (which contain little personal data and no financial information, for example) and instead focus their efforts on remember long, complex passwords for a few important accounts, such as bank accounts. Similar arguments were made by Forbes in not change passwords as often as many \"experts\" advise, due to the same limitations in human memory.\n\nHistorically, many security experts asked people to memorize their passwords: \"Never write down a password\". More recently, many security experts such as Bruce Schneier recommend that people use passwords that are too complicated to memorize, write them down on paper, and keep them in a wallet.\n\nPassword manager software can also store passwords relatively safely, in an encrypted file sealed with a single master password.\n\nAccording to a survey by the University of London, one in ten people are now leaving their passwords in their wills to pass on this important information when they die. One third of people, according to the poll, agree that their password protected data is important enough to pass on in their will.\n\nTwo factor authentication makes passwords more secure. For example, two-factor authentication will send you a text message, e-mail, or alert via a third-party app whenever a login attempt is made and possibly ask you to verify a code sent to you.\n\nMany websites put certain conditions on the passwords their users may choose. These nearly always include standard rules such as minimum and maximum length, but also frequently include composition rules such as featuring at least one capital letter and at least one number/symbol. These latter, more specific rules were largely based on a 2003 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), authored by Bill Burr. It originally proposed the practice of using numbers, obscure characters and capital letters and updating regularly. In a 2017 \"Wall Street Journal\" article, Burr reported he regrets these proposals and made a mistake when he recommended them.\n\nAccording to a 2017 rewrite of this NIST report, many websites have rules that actually have the opposite effect on the security of their users. This includes complex composition rules as well as forced password changes after certain periods of time. While these rules have long been widespread, they have also long been seen as annoying and ineffective by both users and cyber-security experts. The NIST recommends people use longer phrases as passwords (and advises websites to raise the maximum password length) instead of hard-to-remember passwords with \"illusory complexity\" such as \"pA55w+rd\". A user prevented from using the password \"password\" may simply choose \"Password1\" if required to include a number and uppercase letter. Combined with forced periodic password changes, this can lead to passwords that are difficult to remember but easy to crack.\n\nPaul Grassi, one of the 2017 NIST report's authors, further elaborated: \"Everyone knows that an exclamation point is a 1, or an I, or the last character of a password. $ is an S or a 5. If we use these well-known tricks, we aren’t fooling any adversary. We are simply fooling the database that stores passwords into thinking the user did something good.\"\n\nAttempting to crack passwords by trying as many possibilities as time and money permit is a brute force attack. A related method, rather more efficient in most cases, is a dictionary attack. In a dictionary attack, all words in one or more dictionaries are tested. Lists of common passwords are also typically tested.\n\nPassword strength is the likelihood that a password cannot be guessed or discovered, and varies with the attack algorithm used. Cryptologists and computer scientists often refer to the strength or 'hardness' in terms of entropy.\n\nPasswords easily discovered are termed \"weak\" or \"vulnerable\"; passwords very difficult or impossible to discover are considered \"strong\". There are several programs available for password attack (or even auditing and recovery by systems personnel) such as L0phtCrack, John the Ripper, and Cain; some of which use password design vulnerabilities (as found in the Microsoft LANManager system) to increase efficiency. These programs are sometimes used by system administrators to detect weak passwords proposed by users.\n\nStudies of production computer systems have consistently shown that a large fraction of all user-chosen passwords are readily guessed automatically. For example, Columbia University found 22% of user passwords could be recovered with little effort. According to Bruce Schneier, examining data from a 2006 phishing attack, 55% of MySpace passwords would be crackable in 8 hours using a commercially available Password Recovery Toolkit capable of testing 200,000 passwords per second in 2006. He also reported that the single most common password was \"password1\", confirming yet again the general lack of informed care in choosing passwords among users. (He nevertheless maintained, based on these data, that the general quality of passwords has improved over the years—for example, average length was up to eight characters from under seven in previous surveys, and less than 4% were dictionary words.)\n\n\nThe numerous ways in which permanent or semi-permanent passwords can be compromised has prompted the development of other techniques. Unfortunately, some are inadequate in practice, and in any case few have become universally available for users seeking a more secure alternative. A 2012 paper examines why passwords have proved so hard to supplant (despite numerous predictions that they would soon be a thing of the past); in examining thirty representative proposed replacements with respect to security, usability and deployability they conclude \"none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide.\"\n\nThat \"the password is dead\" is a recurring idea in computer security. It often accompanies arguments that the replacement of passwords by a more secure means of authentication is both necessary and imminent. This claim has been made by numerous people at least since 2004. Notably, Bill Gates, speaking at the 2004 RSA Conference predicted the demise of passwords saying \"they just don't meet the challenge for anything you really want to secure.\" In 2011 IBM predicted that, within five years, \"You will never need a password again.\" Matt Honan, a journalist at Wired, who was the victim of a hacking incident, in 2012 wrote \"The age of the password has come to an end.\" Heather Adkins, manager of Information Security at Google, in 2013 said that \"passwords are done at Google.\" Eric Grosse, VP of security engineering at Google, states that \"passwords and simple bearer tokens, such as cookies, are no longer sufficient to keep users safe.\" Christopher Mims, writing in the Wall Street Journal said the password \"is finally dying\" and predicted their replacement by device-based authentication.\nAvivah Litan of Gartner said in 2014 \"Passwords were dead a few years ago. Now they are more than dead.\"\nThe reasons given often include reference to the usability as well as security problems of passwords.\n\nThe claim that \"the password is dead\" is often used by advocates of alternatives to passwords, such as biometrics, two-factor authentication or single sign-on. Many initiatives have been launched with the explicit goal of eliminating passwords. These include Microsoft's Cardspace, the Higgins project, the Liberty Alliance, NSTIC, the FIDO Alliance and various Identity 2.0 proposals. Jeremy Grant, head of NSTIC initiative (the US Dept. of Commerce National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace), declared \"Passwords are a disaster from a security perspective, we want to shoot them dead.\" The FIDO Alliance promises a \"passwordless experience\" in its 2015 specification document.\n\nIn spite of these predictions and efforts to replace them passwords still appear as the dominant form of authentication on the web. In \"The Persistence of Passwords,\" Cormac Herley and Paul van Oorschot suggest that every effort should be made to end the \"spectacularly incorrect assumption\" that passwords are dead.\nThey argue that \"no other single technology matches their combination of cost, immediacy and convenience\" and that \"passwords are themselves the best fit for many of the scenarios in which they are currently used.\"\n\nFollowing the work of Herley and van Oorschot, Bonneau et al. systematically compared web passwords to 35 competing authentication schemes in terms of their usability, deployability, and security. (The technical report is an extended version of the peer-reviewed paper by the same name.) Their analysis shows that most schemes do better than passwords on security, some schemes do better and some worse with respect to usability, while \"every\" scheme does worse than passwords on deployability. The authors conclude with the following observation: “Marginal gains are often not sufficient to reach the activation energy necessary to overcome significant transition costs, which may provide the best explanation of why we are likely to live considerably longer before seeing the funeral procession for passwords arrive at the cemetery.”\n\nPasswords are used on websites to authenticate users and are usually maintained on the Web server, meaning the browser on a remote system sends a password to the server (by HTTP POST), the server checks the password and sends back the relevant content (or an access denied message). This process eliminates the possibility of local reverse engineering as the code used to authenticate the password does not reside on the local machine.\n\nTransmission of the password, via the browser, in plaintext means it can be intercepted along its journey to the server. Many web authentication systems use SSL to establish an encrypted session between the browser and the server, and is usually the underlying meaning of claims to have a \"secure Web site\". This is done automatically by the browser and increases integrity of the session, assuming neither end has been compromised and that the SSL/TLS implementations used are high quality ones.\n\n"}
{"id": "24393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24393", "title": "Parousia", "text": "Parousia\n\nParousia (; ) is an ancient Greek word meaning presence, arrival, or official visit.\n\nFrom the Ptolemaic period to the second century of the common era \"parousia\" was used in the East as a technical expression to denote the arrival or visit of a king or emperor, and celebrated the glory of the sovereign publicly. In memory of the visit of Emperor Nero to the cities of Patras and Corinth, advent coins were struck that carried the legend \"Adventus Augusti Corinth\". The Greek word parousia here corresponded to the Latin word advent. The numerous journeyings of the Emperor Hadrian were celebrated by many advent coins, and often new eras were reckoned from date of the parousia.\n\nThe term occurs only twice in the Septuagint (2 Maccabees 8:12 and 15:21) in its ordinary meaning of arrival. The verb \"πάρειμι\" (páreimi) meaning \"to come\" occurs in the Septuagint and the writings of Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion over 70 times.\n\nThe word is used 24 times in the New Testament. Of these, six uses refer to the coming of individuals: Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (1Co.16:17), Titus (2Co.7:6 & 7) the physical \"presence\" of Paul himself (2Co.10:10, Php.1:26, 2:12), and a 7th use to the \"coming of the lawless one\" (2Thess.2:9). The other seventeen uses refer to the Second Coming of Christ, except the one case in which it refers to the coming of the \"Day of God\" (2Pe.3:12, see also The Day of the Lord).\n\nThe word parousia is found in the following verses: Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39; 1 Corinthians 15:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:19; 3:13; 4:15; 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8, 9; James 5:7, 8; 2 Peter 1:16; 3:4, 12; 1 John 2:28.\n\nThe word \"parousia\" is mainly used in Christian theology to refer to the second coming of Christ.\n\nTwentieth-century theologian Karl Barth suggested that the parousia includes not only Resurrection Sunday but also Pentecost as well. As such, Barth concluded that the New Testament parousia is not limited to Christ's final return.\n\nThe following Greek-English words may be related to, and can be distinguished from, \"parousia\":\n"}
{"id": "24573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24573", "title": "Pepsi", "text": "Pepsi\n\nPepsi is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by PepsiCo. Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28, 1898, and then as Pepsi in 1961.\n\nPepsi was first introduced as \"Brad's Drink\" in New Bern, North Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the root of the word \"dyspepsia\" and the kola nuts used in the recipe. The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.\n\nIn 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer Barney Oldfield was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi-Cola, describing it as \"A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race.\" The advertising theme \"Delicious and Healthful\" was then used over the next two decades.\n\nIn 1931, at the depth of the Great Depression, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcy—in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark. Megargel was unsuccessful, and soon Pepsi's assets were purchased by Charles Guth, the President of Loft, Inc. Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace Coca-Cola at his stores' fountains after The Coca-Cola Company refused to give him a discount on syrup. Guth then had Loft's chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula.\n\nOn three separate occasions between 1922 and 1933, The Coca-Cola Company was offered the opportunity to purchase the Pepsi-Cola company, and it declined on each occasion.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Pepsi-Cola gained popularity following the introduction in 1936 of a 12-ounce bottle. With a radio advertising campaign featuring the jingle \"Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that's a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you\", arranged in such a way that the jingle never ends. Pepsi encouraged price-watching consumers to switch, obliquely referring to the Coca-Cola standard of 6.5 ounces per bottle for the price of five cents (a nickel), instead of the 12 ounces Pepsi sold at the same price. Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi's status. From 1936 to 1938, Pepsi-Cola's profits doubled.\nPepsi's success under Guth came while the Loft Candy business was faltering. Since he had initially used Loft's finances and facilities to establish the new Pepsi success, the near-bankrupt Loft Company sued Guth for possession of the Pepsi-Cola company. A long legal battle, \"Guth v. Loft\", then ensued, with the case reaching the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately ending in a loss for Guth.\n\nFrom the 1930s through the late 1950s, \"Pepsi-Cola Hits The Spot\" was the most commonly used slogan in the days of old radio, classic motion pictures, and later television. Its jingle (conceived in the days when Pepsi cost only five cents) was used in many different forms with different lyrics. With the rise of radio, Pepsi utilized the services of a young, up-and-coming actress named Polly Bergen to promote products, oftentimes lending her singing talents to the classic \"...Hits The Spot\" jingle.\n\nFilm actress Joan Crawford, after marrying Pepsi-Cola President Alfred N. Steele became a spokesperson for Pepsi, appearing in commercials, television specials, and televised beauty pageants on behalf of the company. Crawford also had images of the soft drink placed prominently in several of her later films. When Steele died in 1959, Crawford was appointed to the Board of Directors of Pepsi-Cola, a position she held until 1973, although she was not a board member of the larger PepsiCo, created in 1965.\n\nThe Buffalo Bisons, an American Hockey League team, were sponsored by Pepsi-Cola in its later years; the team adopted the beverage's red, white, and blue color scheme along with a modification of the Pepsi logo (with the word \"Buffalo\" in place of the Pepsi-Cola wordmark). The Bisons ceased operations in 1970, making way for the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nThrough the intervening decades, there have been many different Pepsi theme songs sung on television by a variety of artists, from Joanie Summers to the Jacksons to Britney Spears. (See Slogans.)\n\nIn 1975, Pepsi introduced the Pepsi Challenge marketing campaign where PepsiCo set up a blind tasting between Pepsi-Cola and rival Coca-Cola. During these blind taste tests, the majority of participants picked Pepsi as the better tasting of the two soft drinks. PepsiCo took great advantage of the campaign with television commercials reporting the results to the public.\n\nPepsi has been featured in several films, including \"Back to the Future\" (1985), \"Home Alone\" (1990), \"Wayne's World\" (1992), \"Fight Club\" (1999), and \"World War Z\" (2013).\n\nIn 1996, PepsiCo launched the highly successful Pepsi Stuff marketing strategy. \"Project Blue\" was launched in several international markets outside the United States in April. The launch included extravagant publicity stunts, such as a Concorde aeroplane painted in blue colors (which was owned by Air France) and a banner on the Mir space station.\n\nThe Project Blue design arrived in the United States test marketed in June 1997, and finally released in 1998 worldwide to celebrate Pepsi's 100th anniversary. It was at this point the logo began to be referred to as the Pepsi Globe.\n\nBy 2002, the strategy was cited by Promo Magazine as one of 16 \"Ageless Wonders\" that \"helped redefine promotion marketing\".\n\nIn 2007, PepsiCo redesigned its cans for the fourteenth time, and for the first time, included more than thirty different backgrounds on each can, introducing a new background every three weeks. One of its background designs includes a string of repetitive numbers, \"73774\". This is a numerical expression from a telephone keypad of the word \"Pepsi\". The same number is the SMS short code for Pepsi.\n\nIn late 2008, Pepsi overhauled its entire brand, simultaneously introducing a new logo and a minimalist label design. The redesign was comparable to Coca-Cola's earlier simplification of its can and bottle designs. Pepsi also teamed up with YouTube to produce its first daily entertainment show called Poptub. This show deals with pop culture, internet viral videos, and celebrity gossip.\n\nPepsi has official sponsorship deals with the National Football League, National Hockey League, and National Basketball Association. It was the sponsor of Major League Soccer until December 2015 and Major League Baseball until April 2017, both leagues signing deals with Coca-Cola. Pepsi also has the naming rights to the Pepsi Center, an indoor sports facility in Denver, Colorado. In 1997, after his sponsorship with Coca-Cola ended, retired NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver turned Fox NASCAR announcer Jeff Gordon signed a long-term contract with Pepsi, and he drives with the Pepsi logos on his car with various paint schemes for about 2 races each year, usually a darker paint scheme during nighttime races. Pepsi has remained as one of his sponsors ever since. Pepsi has also sponsored the NFL Rookie of the Year award since 2002.\n\nPepsi also has sponsorship deals in international cricket teams. The Pakistani national cricket team is one of the teams that the brand sponsors. The team wears the Pepsi logo on the front of their test and ODI test match clothing.\n\nIn July 2009, Pepsi started marketing itself as Pecsi in Argentina in response to its name being mispronounced by 25% of the population and as a way to connect more with all of the population.\n\nIn October 2008, Pepsi announced that it would be redesigning its logo and re-branding many of its products by early 2009. In 2009, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Max began using all lower-case fonts for name brands. The brand's blue and red globe trademark became a series of \"smiles\", with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product until 2010. Pepsi released this logo in U.S. in late 2008, and later it was released in 2009 in Canada (the first country outside of the United States for Pepsi's new logo), Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Panama, Chile, Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Australia. In the rest of the world, the new logo was released in 2010. The old logo is still used in several international markets, and has been phased out most recently in France and Mexico. The UK started to use the new Pepsi logo on cans in an order different from the US can. Starting in mid-2010, all Pepsi variants, regular, diet, and Pepsi Max, have started using only the medium-sized \"smile\" Pepsi Globe.\n\nIn 2011, for New York Fashion Week, Diet Pepsi introduced a \"skinny\" can that is taller and has been described as a \"sassier\" version of the traditional can that Pepsi said was made in \"celebration of beautiful, confident women\". The company's equating of \"skinny\" and \"beautiful\" and \"confident\" drew criticism from brand critics, consumers who did not back the \"skinny is better\" ethos, and the National Eating Disorders Association, which said that it took offense to the can and the company's \"thoughtless and irresponsible\" comments. PepsiCo Inc. is a Fashion Week sponsor. This new can was made available to consumers nationwide in March.\n\nIn April 2011, Pepsi announced that customers would be able to buy a complete stranger a soda at a new \"social\" vending machine, and even record a video that the stranger would see when they pick up the gift.\n\nIn March 2013, Pepsi for the first time in 17 years reshaped its 20-ounce bottle. However, some areas did not get the updated bottles until early 2014.\n\nIn November 2013, Pepsi issued an apology on their official Swedish Facebook page for using pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo as a voodoo doll in various scenes before the Sweden v Portugal 2014 FIFA World Cup playoff game.\n\nIn November 2015, Pepsi announced it would launch a new variation called \"1893\". This variation was released in 2016 as a Pepsi variation made with all natural ingredients.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, Pepsi posted a commercial, dubbed “Live for Now (Pepsi)” to YouTube. In the commercial, Kendall Jenner is seen taking off her wig, removing her necklace, and leaving her photoshoot to join a protest going on. The protest ends when Jenner hands a police officer a can of Pepsi soda, reuniting everyone. The advertisement generated public controversy and criticism for trivializing protest movements such as Black Lives Matter. On April 5, 2017, Pepsi issued an apology and removed the commercial from YouTube.\n\nIn May 2018, Pepsi began selling 0,33L cans with designs of older Pepsi generations, with stylized prints of celebrities associated with the brand and the older designs of the Pepsi logo.\n\nWalter Mack was named the new President of Pepsi-Cola and guided the company through the 1940s. Mack, who supported progressive causes, noticed that the company's strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored African Americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks. Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called \"the Negro market\" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. Mack realized that blacks were an untapped niche market and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them. To this end, he hired Hennan Smith, an advertising executive \"from the Negro newspaper field\" to lead an all-black sales team, which had to be cut due to the onset of World War II.\n\nIn 1947, Walter Mack resumed his efforts, hiring Edward F. Boyd to lead a twelve-man team. They came up with advertising portraying black Americans in a positive light, such as one with a smiling mother holding a six pack of Pepsi while her son (a young Ron Brown, who grew up to be Secretary of Commerce) reaches up for one. Another ad campaign, titled \"Leaders in Their Fields\", profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche and photographer Gordon Parks.\n\nBoyd also led a sales team composed entirely of blacks around the country to promote Pepsi. Racial segregation and Jim Crow laws were still in place throughout much of the U.S.; Boyd's team faced a great deal of discrimination as a result, from insults by Pepsi co-workers to threats by the Ku Klux Klan. On the other hand, it was able to use its anti-racism stance as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of The Coca-Cola Company for segregationist Governor of Georgia Herman Talmadge. As a result, Pepsi's market share as compared to Coca-Cola's shot up dramatically in the 1950s with African American soft-drink consumers three times more likely to purchase Pepsi over Coke. After the sales team visited Chicago, Pepsi's share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time.\n\nJournalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s. The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, ladies groups, schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to promote Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.\n\nPepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens, whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead, it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.\n\nThis focus on the market for black people caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. It did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear white customers would be pushed away. In a national meeting, Mack tried to assuage the 500 bottlers in attendance by pandering to them, saying \"We don't want it to become known as a nigger drink.\" After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and it was cut.\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores, in what was called the \"Pepsi Challenge\". These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi (which is believed to have more lemon oil, and less orange oil, and uses vanillin rather than vanilla) to Coke. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the \"Challenge\" across the nation. This became known as the \"Cola Wars\".\n\nIn 1985, The Coca-Cola Company, amid much publicity, changed its formula. The theory has been advanced that New Coke, as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge. However, a consumer backlash led to Coca-Cola quickly reintroducing the original formula as \"Coca-Cola Classic\".\n\nIn 1989, Billy Joel mentioned the rivalry between the two companies in the song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\". The line \"Rock & Roller Cola Wars\" refers to Pepsi and Coke's usage of various musicians in advertising campaigns. Coke used Paula Abdul, while Pepsi used Michael Jackson. Both companies then competed to get other musicians to advertise its beverages.\n\nAccording to \"Beverage Digest\"s 2008 report on carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo's U.S. market share is 30.8 percent, while The Coca-Cola Company's is 42.7 percent. Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi in most parts of the U.S., notable exceptions being central Appalachia, North Dakota, and Utah. In the city of Buffalo, New York, Pepsi outsells Coca-Cola by a two-to-one margin.\n\nOverall, Coca-Cola continues to outsell Pepsi in almost all areas of the world. However, exceptions include: Oman, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, and Northern Ontario.\n\nPepsi had long been the drink of French-Canadians, and it continues to hold its dominance by relying on local Québécois celebrities (especially Claude Meunier, of \"La Petite Vie\" fame) to sell its product. PepsiCo introduced the Quebec slogan \"here, it's Pepsi\" (\"Ici, c'est Pepsi\") in response to Coca-Cola ads proclaiming \"Around the world, it's Coke\" (\"Partout dans le monde, c'est Coke\").\n\nAs of 2012, Pepsi is the third most popular carbonated drink in India, with a 15% market share, behind Sprite and Thums Up. In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.8% of the Indian market share. By most accounts, Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977, when it left India because of the new foreign exchange laws which mandated majority shareholding in companies to be held by Indian shareholders. The Coca-Cola Company was unwilling to dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), thus sharing its formula with an entity in which it did not have majority shareholding. In 1988, PepsiCo gained entry to India by creating a joint venture with the Punjab government-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation (PAIC) and Voltas India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994. In 1993, The Coca-Cola Company returned in pursuance of India's Liberalization policy.\n\nIn Russia, Pepsi initially had a larger market share than Coke, but it was undercut once the Cold War ended. In 1972, PepsiCo struck a barter agreement with the then government of the Soviet Union, in which PepsiCo was granted exportation and Western marketing rights to Stolichnaya vodka in exchange for importation and Soviet marketing of Pepsi. This exchange led to Pepsi being the first foreign product sanctioned for sale in the Soviet Union.\n\nReminiscent of the way that Coca-Cola became a cultural icon and its global spread spawned words like \"cocacolonization\", Pepsi-Cola and its relation to the Soviet system turned it into an icon. In the early 1990s, the term \"Pepsi-stroika\" began appearing as a pun on \"perestroika\", the reform policy of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. Critics viewed the policy as an attempt to usher in Western products in deals there with the old elites. Pepsi, as one of the first American products in the Soviet Union, became a symbol of that relationship and the Soviet policy. This was reflected in Russian author Victor Pelevin's book \"Generation P\".\n\nIn 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Coca-Cola was introduced to the Russian market. As it came to be associated with the new system and Pepsi to the old, Coca-Cola rapidly captured a significant market share that might otherwise have required years to achieve. By July 2005, Coca-Cola enjoyed a market share of 19.4 percent, followed by Pepsi with 13 percent.\n\nPepsi was introduced in Romania in 1966, during the early liberalization policies of Nicolae Ceaușescu, opening up a factory at Constanța in 1967. This was done as a barter agreement similar to the one in the USSR, however, Romanian wine would be sold in the United States instead. The product quickly became popular, especially among young people, but due to the austerity measures imposed in the 1980s, the product became scarce and rare to find. Starting from 1991, PepsiCo entered the new Romanian market economy, and still maintains a bigger popularity than its competitor, Coca Cola, introduced in Romania in 1992, despite heavy competition during the 1990s (sometime between 2000 and 2005, Pepsi overtook Coca-Cola in sales in Romania). \n\nPepsi did not sell soft drinks in Israel until 1991. Many Israelis and some American Jewish organizations attributed Pepsi's previous reluctance to expand operations in Israel to fears of an Arab boycott. Pepsi, which has a large and lucrative business in the Arab world, denied that, saying that economic, rather than political, reasons kept it out of Israel.\n\nPepsiman is an official Pepsi mascot from Pepsi's Japanese corporate branch, created sometime around the mid-1990s. Pepsiman took on three different outfits, each one representing the current style of the Pepsi can in distribution. Twelve commercials were created featuring the character. His role in the advertisements is to appear with Pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda. Pepsiman happens to appear at just the right time with the product. After delivering the beverage, sometimes Pepsiman would encounter a difficult and action-oriented situation which would result in injury. Another more minor mascot, Pepsiwoman, also featured in a few of her own commercials for Pepsi Twist; her appearance is basically a female Pepsiman wearing a lemon-shaped balaclava.\n\nIn 1996, Sega-AM2 released the Sega Saturn version of its arcade fighting game \"Fighting Vipers\". In this game Pepsiman was included as a special character, with his specialty listed as being the ability to \"quench one's thirst\". He does not appear in any other version or sequel. In 1999, KID developed a video game for the PlayStation entitled \"Pepsiman\". As the titular character, the player runs \"on rails\" (forced motion on a scrolling linear path), skateboards, rolls, and stumbles through various areas, avoiding dangers and collecting cans of Pepsi, all while trying to reach a thirsty person as in the commercials.\n\nIn 2002, at Novosibirsk, Pepsi created a contest to win a car, where customers who bought a bottle of Pepsi could win a car by choosing the right key for the car. However, when a man was able to open a car, he was sued by Pepsi, as Pepsi considered that he had forced the car open by applying pressure on the lock instead of selecting the right key, although the man stated that he had complied with every step of the contest rules.\n\nIn 2004, advertising agency BBDO Paris produced a three-minute music video-style commercial for Pepsi featuring singers Britney Spears, Beyoncé and Pink as gladiatrices sent into an ancient Roman colosseum to battle one another. Instead, they throw down their weapons and perform a cover version of Queen's 1977 hit song \"We Will Rock You\" to a cheering, foot-stomping crowd. They then drink cans of Pepsi while the Emperor (played by Enrique Iglesias) is thrown into the arena to face a lion.\n\nIn the United States, Pepsi is made with carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, sugar, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid, and natural flavors. A can of Pepsi (12 fl ounces) has 41 grams of carbohydrates (all from sugars), 30 mg of sodium, 0 grams of fat, 0 grams of protein, 38 mg of caffeine, and 150 calories. Pepsi has 10 more calories and 2 more grams of sugar and carbohydrates than Coca-Cola. Caffeine-Free Pepsi contains the same ingredients but without the caffeine.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24768", "title": "Pizza", "text": "Pizza\n\nPizza (, ) is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand. Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas.\n\nThe term \"pizza\" was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery. Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.\n\nThe \"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\" (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.\n\nThe word \"pizza\" first appeared in a Latin text from the central Italian town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta \"duodecim pizze\" (\"twelve pizzas\") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.\n\nSuggested etymologies include:\n\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of Achaemenid Empire during the rule King Darius I baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.\n\nModern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, antecedents to modern pizzerias.\n\nA popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, \"pizza Margherita\", was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although later research cast doubt on this legend. An official letter of recognition from the Queen's \"head of service\" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.\n\nPizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular. Since then pizza consumption has exploded in the United States. Pizza chains such as Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide. 13% of the United States population consumes pizza on any given day.\n\nPizza is prepared fresh, frozen, and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.\n\nAnother form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.\n\nIn restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly in a metal oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it. Aficionado home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. Dome-shaped pizza ovens have been used for centuries, which is one way to achieve true heat distribution in a wood-fired pizza oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\n\nWhen it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass production of pizza, the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.\n\nThe bottom of the pizza, called the \"crust\", may vary widely according to style, thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the \"cornicione\". Pizza dough often contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.\n\nDipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust.\n\nMozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples. Eventually, other cheeses were used well as pizza ingredients, particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was in the U.S. and in Europe.\n\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizza (\"pizza napoletana\") is made with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio. This mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin. Other traditional pizzas include \"pizza alla marinara\", which is topped with marinara sauce and is supposedly the most ancient tomato-topped pizza,\npizza capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham, mushroom, artichoke and tomato, and pizza pugliese, prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onions.\n\nA popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called \"sfincione\" or \"sfinciuni\"), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, \"sfincione\" was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island. Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example \"pizza al padellino\" or \"pizza al tegamino\", a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.\n\nCommon toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the 20th century, including California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York and St. Louis styles. The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905 and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.\n\nAnother variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side. Toppings may be sliced thin to ensure that they heat through, and chunkier toppings such as sausage or peppers may be precooked before being placed on the pizza. Garlic, herbs, or other ingredients are sometimes added to the pizza or the crust to maximize the flavor of the dish.\n\nGrilled pizza was offered in the United States at the Al Forno restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island by owners Johanne Killeen and George Germon in 1980. Although it was inspired by a misunderstanding that confused a wood-fired brick oven with a grill, grilled pizza did exist prior to 1980, both in Italy, and in Argentina where it is known as \"pizza a la parrilla\". It has become a popular cookout dish, and there are even some pizza restaurants that specialize in the style. The traditional style of grilled pizza employed at Al Forno restaurant uses a dough coated with olive oil, strained tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella, and a garnish made from shaved scallions, and is served uncut. The final product can be likened to flatbread with pizza toppings. Another Providence establishment, Bob & Timmy's Grilled Pizza, was featured in a Providence-themed episode of the Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food Nation\" in 2011.\n\nArgentina, and more specifically Buenos Aires, received a massive Italian immigration at the turn of the 19th century. Immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though over time Spanish residents came to own the majority of the pizza businesses.\n\nStandard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called \"media masa\" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Argentine gastronomy tradition, served pizza with fainá, which is a Genovese chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza, and moscato wine. The most popular variety of pizza is called \"muzarela\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker \"media masa\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found in nearly every corner of the country; Buenos Aires is considered the city with the most pizza bars by person of the world. Other popular varieties include jam, tomato slices, red pepper and longaniza. Two Argentine-born varieties of pizza with onion, are also very popular: fugazza with cheese and fugazzetta. The former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the later has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.\n\nThe world's largest pizza was prepared in Rome in December 2012, and measured . The pizza was named \"Ottavia\" in homage to the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus, and was made with a gluten-free base. The world's longest pizza was made in\nFontana, California in 2017 and measured .\n\nThe world's most expensive pizza listed by \"Guinness World Records\" is a commercially available thin-crust pizza at Maze restaurant in London, United Kingdom, which costs . The pizza is wood fire-baked, and is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce, and fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle.\n\nThere are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the \"Pizza Royale 007\" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which has caviar, lobster and is topped with 24-carat gold dust, and the caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York. However, these are not officially recognized by \"Guinness World Records\". Additionally, a pizza was made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla that included toppings such as sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon, medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster marinated in cognac, and champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was auctioned for charity in 2007, raising .\n\nIn 2017, the world pizza market was $128 billion and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over, consumed pizza on any given day.\n\nSome mass-produced pizzas by fast food chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat and calories (food energy). The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,101 mg per pizza in fast food chains. There are concerns about negative health effects. Food chains have come under criticism at various times for the high salt content of some of their meals.\n\nFrequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease and digestive tract cancers relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the correlation between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various health benefits.\n\nSome attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce, which research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers.\n\nNational Pizza Month is an annual observance that occurs for the month of October in the United States and some areas of Canada. This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of \"Pizza Today\" magazine. During this time, some people observe National Pizza Month by consuming various types of pizzas or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.\n\n\n\n"}

The word is probably a corruption or imagined version of the word \"puppetuse,\" an original coinage, written by a fourteen year old Vernon Green, and subsequently released in 1954 as the Doo Wop song \"The Letter\" performed by himself and The Medallions -- a song which also included another original coinage, \"pismotality.\" In other songs, \"Enter Maurice\" and \"The Conversation,\" Miller adds the word \"epismetology\" to \"pompatus,\" one in spoken word, the style of \"The Letter,\" in a likely homage to the Doo Wop song. The oddness of the word \"pompatus\" occasioned some attention and further use, including being used in the title of a movie.\n\nThe lyrics of \"The Joker\" include the quatrain:\n\nEach line references a track on a previous Miller album: \"Space Cowboy\" on \"Brave New World\" (1969); \"Gangster of Love\" on \"Sailor\" (1968); and \"Enter Maurice\" on \"Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden\" (1972), which includes the lines:\n\nAlthough Miller claims he invented the words \"epismetology\" (a metathesis of the word epistemology) and \"pompatus\", both are variants of words which Miller most likely heard in a song by Vernon Green called \"The Letter,\" which was recorded by the Los Angeles Doo-Wop group The Medallions in 1954.\n\nGreen's \"The Letter\" as performed by the Medallions had the lines:\n\nGreen describes the lyrics as a description of his dream woman. \"\"Pizmotality\" described words of such secrecy that they could only be spoken to the one you loved\", Green explained. He coined the term \"puppetutes\" \"to mean a secret paper-doll fantasy figure who would be my everything and bear my children\".\n\nBecause of its peculiarity, the word \"pompatus\" has secured a niche in 20th century pop culture. Wolfman Jack frequently referenced the phrase and there is a sound clip of him using the line within the song \"Clap for the Wolfman\" by The Guess Who. \"The Pompatus of Love\", a 1996 film starring Jon Cryer, featured four men discussing a number of assorted topics, including attempts to determine the meaning of the phrase. Jon Cryer was also a writer of the film, and describes finding out the meaning of the phrase during a phone call with Vernon Green in his autobiography \"so that happened\" in chapter 22, page 217. The line has been mentioned in various television show gags, including \"The Simpsons\" and \"South Park\".\n\nHumor columnist Dave Barry frequently refers to the song line as a source of comedic value, particularly in his 1997 book \"Dave Barry's Book of Bad Songs\". 'Pompatus' is used by Michael Ondaatje in his 2001 book \"Anil's Ghost\". Stephen King uses the word in his 2006 novel \"Lisey's Story\". Tim Dorsey uses the word in his 2010 novel, \"Gator a-Go-Go\". It was the subject of the October 9, 2011 \"Over the Hedge\" comic strip.\n\n\nhttps://santafe.com/blogs/read/the-jo"}

{"id": "24851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24851", "title": "Potato chip", "text": "Potato chip\n\nPotato chips (often just chips), or crisps, are thin slices of potato that have been deep fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.\n\nPotato chips are a predominant part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total savory snacks market in that year ($46.1 billion).\n\nThe earliest known recipe for something similar to today's potato chips is in William Kitchiner's cookbook \"The Cook's Oracle\", first published in 1817, which was a bestseller in England. The 1822 edition's version of recipe 104 is called \"Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings\" and reads \"peel large potatoes, slice them about a quarter of an inch thick, or cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping\". Early recipes for potato chips in the United States are found in Mary Randolph's \"Virginia House-Wife\" (1824), and in N.K.M. Lee's \"Cook's Own Book\" (1832), both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.\n\nHowever, a legend associates the creation of potato chips with Saratoga Springs, New York, decades later. By the late nineteenth century, a popular version of the story attributed the dish to George Crum, an American cook of African American and Native American heritage at Moon's Lake House, who was trying to appease an unhappy customer on 24 August 1853. The customer kept sending his French-fried potatoes back, complaining that they were too thick, too \"soggy,\" and/or not salted well enough. Frustrated, Crum personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried the potato slices to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To Crum's surprise, the customer loved them. They soon came to be called \"Saratoga Chips,\" a name that persisted into at least the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips, said that Crum's customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt. Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time, and by 1860, he owned his own lakeside restaurant, which he called Crum's House.\n\nIn the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption. The Dayton, Ohio-based Mike-sell's Potato Chip Company, founded in 1910, identifies as the \"oldest potato chip company in the United States\". New England-based Tri-Sum Potato Chips, founded in 1908 as the Leominster Potato Chip Company, in Leominster, Massachusetts claim to be America's first potato chip manufacturer.\n\nIn an idea originated by the Smiths Potato Crisps Company Ltd, formed in 1920, Frank Smith packaged a twist of salt with his chips in greaseproof paper bags, which were sold around London. The potato chip remained otherwise unseasoned until an innovation by Joe \"Spud\" Murphy, the owner of the Irish crisps company Tayto, who in the 1950s developed a technology to add seasoning during manufacture. After some trial and error, Murphy and his employee Seamus Burke produced the world's first seasoned chips: Cheese & Onion and Salt & Vinegar. Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto's technique.\n\nThe first flavored chips in the United States, barbecue flavor, were being manufactured and sold by 1954. In 1958, Herr's was the first company to introduce barbecue-flavored potato chips in Pennsylvania.\n\nChips sold in markets were usually sold in tins or scooped out of storefront glass bins and delivered by horse and wagon. Early potato chip bags were wax paper with the ends ironed or stapled together. At first, potato chips were packaged in barrels or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled.\n\nIn the 1920s, Laura Scudder, an entrepreneur in Monterey Park, California, started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day. This pioneering method reduced crumbling and kept the chips fresh and crisp longer. This innovation, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed potato chips to become a mass-market product. Today, chips are packaged in plastic bags, with nitrogen gas blown in prior to sealing to lengthen shelf life, and provide protection against crushing.\n\nChips were long made in a batch process, where the potato slices are rinsed with cold water to release starch, fried at a low temperature (), and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together.\n\nIndustrial advances resulted in a shift to production by a continuous process, running chips through a vat of hot oil and drying them in a conveyor process.\n\nSome small producers continued to use a batch process, notably in Maui. In 1980, inspired by the Maui Chip, an entrepreneur started Cape Cod Potato Chips to produce thicker, batch-cooked \"Hawaiian style\" potato chips, which came to be known as kettle-style (US) or hand-cooked (UK) chips and became a premium, \"gourmet\" item. Kettle chips are thicker and the surface starch is not rinsed off, resulting in a style of chip called \"hard bite\".\n\nLittle consistency exists in the English-speaking world for names of fried potato slices, thick or thin. American and Canadian English use \"chips\" for the above-mentioned dish — this term is also used (but not universally) in other parts of world, and sometimes \"crisps\" for the same made from batter.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, \"crisps\" are potato chips which are eaten at room temperature, whilst \"chips\" are similar to french fries (as in \"fish and chips\") and are served hot. In Australia, some parts of South Africa, New Zealand, India, the general West Indies especially in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as \"chips\", as are the larger \"home-style\" potato crisps. In the north of New Zealand, they are known as \"chippies\", but are marketed as \"chips\" throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand, sometimes the distinction is made between \"hot chips\" (fried potatoes) and \"chips\" or \"potato chips\". In Bangladesh, they are generally known as \"chip\" or \"chips\", and much less frequently as \"crisps\" (pronounced \"kirisp\") and locally, \"alu bhaja\" (for their similarity to the native potato \"bhajji\").\n\nIn German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: \"\"Kartoffelchips\"\"; Switzerland: \"\"Pommes Chips\"\") and in countries of the former SFR Yugoslavia, fried thin potato slices are known as \"chips\" (locally pronounced very similar to the actual English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from french fries. In Brazil, \"home-style\" potato chips are known as (\"Portuguese potatoes\") if their sides are relatively smooth and (\"Prussian potatoes\") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato purée-based dough are known as \"batata chips\" (\"potato chips\"), or just .\n\nMost potato chips contain high levels of sodium, from salt. This has been linked to health issues such as high blood pressure. However, researchers at Queen Mary University of London in 2004 have noted that a small \"bag of ready-salted crisps\" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including \"every brand of cornflakes on sale in the UK.\"\n\nSome potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. PepsiCo research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of Lay's potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.\n\nUnsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand Salt 'n' Shake, whose chips are not seasoned, but instead include a small salt sachet in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as Frito-Lay, also offer such a product.\n\nAnother possible health concern related to potato chips is acrylamide, which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. Studies suggest that rodents exposed to high levels of acrylamide develop cancer, however it is currently unclear whether a similar risk exists in humans. Many potato chip manufacturers attempt to remove burned and thus potentially acrylamide-rich chips before the packaging process. Large scanners are used to eliminate crisps worst affected by heat. \n\nIn Canada, seasonings include dill pickle, jalapeño, ketchup, barbecue, all dressed, sour cream and onion, and salt and vinegar. In 2006, Lay's introduced wasabi chips in Toronto and Vancouver, but no longer offers them. Loblaw, Canada's largest food retailer, offers several unusual flavors under its President's Choice brand, including poutine, maple bacon, Jamaican jerk chicken, Greek feta and olive, ballpark hot dog, and barbeque baby back ribs.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the two prominent potato chips are the spicy \"Ethnican\" variety by Calbee, and barbecue by Jack 'n Jill. Lay's are also popular in Hong Kong.\n\nIn Indonesia, potato chips are commonly called as \"kripik kentang\", traditionally fell under \"kripik\" category. Indonesian potato chips market is mainly ruled by two brands; Indofood's Chitato (since 1990s) and Lay's (an Indofood and Frito-Lay joint venture). In 2014, Japanese Calbee and Indonesian Wing's food formed Calbeewings, a joint venture and marketed Potabee potato chips in Indonesia. \n\nCommon potato chips flavors marketed in Indonesia include beef barbecue, spicy chicken, cheese and plain salted. \nLay's potato chips sold in Indonesia is available in 6 flavors; honey butter, sour cream and onion, nori seaweed, beef barbecue, classic salty, and salmon teriyaki flavors. Potabee sold in Indonesia offers two flavors; beef BBQ and grilled seaweed. In 2018 Chitato launched \"Do Us A Flavor\" campaign that sell three unusual flavors; beef rendang, fried crab golden egg yolk, and mango sticky rice.\n\nIn Ireland, the two most popular flavors are cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar. However in Ireland, the word \"Tayto\" is synonymous with potato chips after the Tayto brand and can be used to describe all varieties of chips, including those not produced by Tayto. Hunky Dorys and King crisps are other popular Irish brands. In November 2010, the Tayto company opened a theme park called \"Tayto Park\".\n\nIn Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands only two flavors were traditionally available, red paprika (\"paprika\", sometimes also called \"ungarisch\") and salted (\"gesalzen\"). These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"chakalaka\", \"currywurst\", \"pommes\" (french fries), \"\"Rot-weiss\"\" (red and white - french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). Potato chips made from ground potatoes are called \"Stapelchips\" rather than \"Kartoffelchips\" for legal reasons.\n\nIn Colombia, lemon, chicken, chorizo, and sirloin steak with mushroom sauce flavored potato chips are sold.\n\nIn Japan, flavors include norishio (nori and salt), \"consommé\", wasabi, soy sauce and butter, garlic, plum, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, and black pepper. Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are also available. Major manufacturers are Calbee, Koikeya and Yamayoshi.\n\nThe market in the United Kingdom is led by Walkers, which held 56% of the British crisp market in 2013. Walkers is known for its wide variety of potato crisps. The three main flavors are ready salted, cheese and onion, and salt and vinegar; however, other examples are prawn cocktail (which were incorrectly described in the media as being subject to an EU directive banning them), Worcester sauce, roast chicken, beef and onion, smoky bacon, lamb and mint, ham and mustard, barbecue, BBQ rib, tomato ketchup, sausage and ketchup, pickled onion, Branston pickle, and Marmite. \n\nMore exotic flavors are Thai sweet chili, roast pork and creamy mustard sauce, lime and Thai spices, chicken with Italian herbs, sea salt and cracked black pepper, sea salt and chardonnay wine vinegar, sea salt and cider vinegar, spicy and aromatic curry, turkey and bacon, caramelized onion and sweet balsamic vinegar, Stilton and cranberry, mango chili, and special flavors, such as American cheeseburger and English roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Kettle Foods Ltd's range of thick-cut crunchy potato crisps include gourmet flavors: Mexican limes with a hint of chilli, salsa with mesquite, buffalo mozzarella tomato and basil, mature cheddar with Adnams Broadside Beer, Soulmate cheeses, and onion. McCoys Crisps are also popular in the UK. In the north of England, Seabrook Potato Crisps are popular, but they are much less common in the south. Tayto is a popular brand in Northern Ireland. Since 2008, Walkers has launched its \"Do Us a Flavour\" campaign, challenging the UK public to think up unique flavours for their crisps. Six flavours were chosen from among the entries and released as special editions. Consumers could vote on their favourite, and the winner would become a permanent flavour.\n\nIn the United States, popular potato chip flavorings include sour cream and onion, salt and vinegar, and barbecue. In the Gulf South, Zapp's Potato Chips of Gramercy, Louisiana, manufactures kettle-fried chips with regional flavors such as Crawtator, Cajun dill, Voodoo, and Creole onion.\n\nPennsylvania leads the United States in potato-chip production, and it has been dubbed \"the Potato Chip Capital\" by several sources. Pennsylvania-based companies that produce potato chips include Utz Quality Foods, Herr's Snacks, Snyder's of Hanover, Martin's Potato Chips, Wise Foods, Middleswarth Potato Chips, Dieffenbach's Potato Chips, Hartley's Potato Chips, Gibbles Foods, Stehman's Potato Chips, and Charles Chips. These are all member companies of \"The Snack Food Association of the United States.\"\n\nAnother type of potato chip, notably the Pringles and Lay's Stax brands, is made by extruding or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potatoes into the desired shape before frying. This makes chips that are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as \"potato crisps\", but they are rarely referred to as such by Americans. Conversely, Pringles may be termed \"potato chips\" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional \"crisps\". Munchos, another brand that uses the term \"potato crisps\", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.\n\nAn additional variant of potato chips exists in the form of \"potato sticks\", also called \"shoestring potatoes\". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3 mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name \"Hickory Sticks\". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category under the Durkee Potato Stix and French's Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.\n\nA larger variant (about 1 cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as Andy Capp's Pub Fries, using the theme of a long-running British comic strip, which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors.\nWalkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called \"Chipsticks\" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.\n\nSome companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.\nAmericans' appetite for crispy snacks gave birth to the packaged, flavored corn chips, with such brands as Fritos, CC's, and Doritos dominating the market. \"Swamp chips\" are similarly made from a variety of root vegetables, such as parsnips, rutabagas, and carrots. Japanese-style variants include extruded chips, like products made from rice or cassava. In South Indian snack cuisine, an item called \"happla\" in Kannada/\"vadam\" in Tamil, is a chip made of an extruded rice-sago or multigrain base that has been around for many centuries.\n\nMany other products might be called \"crisps\" in Britain, but would not be classed as \"potato chips\" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, Wotsits, Quavers, Skips, Hula Hoops, and Monster Munch).\n\nKumara (sweet potato) chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, beetroot, and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and casava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.\n"}
{"id": "24985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24985", "title": "Pronoun", "text": "Pronoun\n\nIn linguistics and grammar, a pronoun (abbreviated ) is a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase. It is a particular case of a pro-form.\n\nPronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform cross-linguistically. Subtypes include personal and possessive pronouns, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, relative and interrogative pronouns, and indefinite pronouns.\n\nThe use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on an antecedent. This applies especially to third-person personal pronouns and relative pronouns. For example, in the sentence \"That poor man looks as if he needs a new coat\", the antecedent of the pronoun \"he\" is dependent on \"that poor man\".\n\nThe adjective associated with \"pronoun\" is pronominal. A pronominal is also a word or phrase that acts as a pronoun. For example, in \"That's not the one I wanted\", the phrase \"the one\" (containing the prop-word \"one\") is a pronominal.\n\nPronouns \"(antōnymía)\" are listed as one of eight parts of speech in \"The Art of Grammar\", a treatise on Greek grammar attributed to Dionysius Thrax and dating from the 2nd century BC. The pronoun is described there as \"a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person.\" Pronouns continued to be regarded as a part of speech in Latin grammar (the Latin term being \"pronomen\", from which the English name – through Middle French – ultimately derives), and thus in the European tradition generally.\n\nIn more modern approaches, pronouns are less likely to be considered to be a single word class, because of the many different syntactic roles that they play, as represented by the various different types of pronouns listed in the previous sections.\n\nCertain types of pronouns are often identical or similar in form to determiners with related meaning; some English examples are given in the table on the right. This observation has led some linguists, such as Paul Postal, to regard pronouns as determiners that have had their following noun or noun phrase deleted. (Such patterning can even be claimed for certain personal pronouns; for example, \"we\" and \"you\" might be analyzed as determiners in phrases like \"we Brits\" and \"you tennis players\".) Other linguists have taken a similar view, uniting pronouns and determiners into a single class, sometimes called \"determiner-pronoun\", or regarding determiners as a subclass of pronouns or vice versa. The distinction may be considered to be one of subcategorization or valency, rather like the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs – determiners take a noun phrase complement like transitive verbs do, while pronouns do not. This is consistent with the determiner phrase viewpoint, whereby a determiner, rather than the noun that follows it, is taken to be the head of the phrase.\n\nThe grammatical behavior of certain types of pronouns, and in particular their possible relationship with their antecedents, has been the focus of studies in binding, notably in the Chomskyan government and binding theory. In this binding context, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns in English (such as \"himself\" and \"each other\") are referred to as anaphors (in a specialized restricted sense) rather than as pronominal elements. The type of binding that applies to subsets of pronouns varies cross linguistically.\n\nPersonal pronouns may be classified by person, number, gender and case. English has three persons (first, second and third) and two numbers (singular and plural); in the third person singular there are also distinct pronoun forms for male, female and neuter gender. Principal forms are shown in the adjacent table (see also English personal pronouns).\n\nEnglish personal pronouns have two cases, \"subject\" and \"object\". Subject pronouns are used in subject position (I like to eat chips, but she does not\"). Object pronouns are used for the object of a verb or preposition (\"John likes me but not her).\n\nOther distinct forms found in some languages include:\n\n\nSome special uses of personal pronouns include:\n\n\nPossessive pronouns are used to indicate possession (in a broad sense). Some occur as independent noun phrases: \"mine\", \"yours\", \"hers\", \"ours\", \"theirs\". An example is: \"Those clothes are mine.\" Others act as a determiner (adjective) and must accompany a noun: \"my\", \"your\", \"her\", \"our\", \"your\", \"their\", as in: \"I lost my wallet.\" (\"His\" and \"its\" can fall into either category, although \"its\" is nearly always found in the second.) Those of the second type have traditionally also been described as possessive adjectives, and in more modern terminology as possessive determiners. The term \"possessive pronoun\" is sometimes restricted to the first type. Both types replace possessive noun phrases. As an example, Their crusade to capture our attention\" could replace The advertisers' crusade to capture our attention.\"\n\nReflexive pronouns are used when a person or thing acts on itself, for example, \"John cut himself.\" In English they all end in \"-self\" or \"-selves\" and must refer to a noun phrase elsewhere in the same clause.\n\nReciprocal pronouns refer to a reciprocal relationship (\"each other\", \"one another\"). They must refer to a noun phrase in the same clause. An example in English is: \"They do not like each other.\" In some languages, the same forms can be used as both reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.\n\nDemonstrative pronouns (in English, \"this\", \"that\" and their plurals \"these\", \"those\") often distinguish their targets by pointing or some other indication of position; for example, \"I'll take these.\" They may also be \"anaphoric\", depending on an earlier expression for context, for example, \"A kid actor would try to be all sweet, and who needs that?\"\n\nIndefinite pronouns, the largest group of pronouns, refer to one or more unspecified persons or things. One group in English includes compounds of \"some-\", \"any-\", \"every-\" and \"no-\" with \"-thing\", \"-one\" and \"-body\", for example: \"Anyone can do that.\" Another group, including \"many\", \"more\", \"both\", and \"most\", can appear alone or followed by \"of\". In addition,\n\n\nRelative pronouns (\"who\", \"whom\", \"whose\", \"what\", \"which\" and \"that\") refer back to people or things previously mentioned: \"People who smoke should quit now.\" They are used in relative clauses.\n\nRelative pronouns can be used in an interrogative setting as interrogative pronouns. Interrogative pronouns ask which person or thing is meant. In reference to a person, one may use \"who\" (subject), \"whom\" (object) or \"whose\" (possessive); for example, \"Who did that?\" In colloquial speech, \"whom\" is generally replaced by \"who\". English non-personal interrogative pronouns (\"which\" and \"what\") have only one form.\n\nIn English and many other languages (e.g. French and Czech), the sets of relative and interrogative pronouns are nearly identical. Compare English: \"Who is that?\" (interrogative) and \"I know the woman who came\" (relative). In some other languages, interrogative pronouns and indefinite pronouns are frequently identical; for example, Standard Chinese 什么 \"shénme\" means \"what?\" as well as \"something\" or \"anything\".\n\nThough the personal pronouns described above are the \"contemporary\" English pronouns, older forms of \"modern\" English (as used by Shakespeare, for example) use a slightly different set of personal pronouns as shown in the table. The difference is entirely in the second person. Though one would rarely find these older forms used in literature from recent centuries, they are nevertheless considered \"modern\".\n\nThe use of pronouns often involves anaphora, where the meaning of the pronoun is dependent on another referential element. The referent of the pronoun is often the same as that of a preceding (or sometimes following) noun phrase, called the antecedent of the pronoun. The following sentences give examples of particular types of pronouns used with antecedents:\n\n\nSome other types, such as indefinite pronouns, are usually used without antecedents. Relative pronouns are used without antecedents in free relative clauses. Even third-person personal pronouns are sometimes used without antecedents (\"unprecursed\") – this applies to special uses such as dummy pronouns and generic \"they\", as well as cases where the referent is implied by the context.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25033", "title": "Piña colada", "text": "Piña colada\n\nThe piña colada (; , \"pineapple,\" and , \"strained\") is a sweet cocktail made with rum, coconut cream or coconut milk, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both.\n\nThe name \"piña colada\" literally means \"strained pineapple\", a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation.\n\nThe earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, to boost his crew's morale, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple and white rum. This was what would be later known as the famous piña colada. With his death in 1825, the recipe for the piña colada was lost. Historian Haydée Reichard disputes this version of the story.\n\nIn 1950 \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Drinks in the West Indies range from Martinique's famous rum punch to Cuba's pina colada (rum, pineapple and coconut milk).\"\n\nThe Caribe Hilton claims Ramón \"Monchito\" Marrero created the Piña Colada in 1954 while a bartender at the hotel. According to this account, Mr. Marrero finally settled upon the recipe for the Piña Colada, which he felt captured the true nature and essence of Puerto Rico. The hotel was presented with a proclamation in 2004 by Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. Calderón celebrating the drink's 50th anniversary.\n\nBarrachina, a restaurant in Puerto Rico, says that \"a traditional Spanish bartender Don Ramon Portas Mingot in 1963 created what became the world's famous drink: the Piña Colada.\"\n\nIn 1978 Puerto Rico officially proclaimed the cocktail its national drink.\nNational Piña Colada Day is celebrated on the islands on 10 July.\n\nThis cocktail gained fame in Puerto Rico from 1978, and it gained worldwide fame after Rupert Holmes released his 1979 song \"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)\", which became a popular hit around the world.\n\nJazz icon and flugelhorn player Chuck Mangione likewise released a tune titled \"Piña Colada\" on his 1979 album \"Fun and Games\".\n\nThe cocktail serves as part of the title of the Garth Brooks song \"Two Piña Coladas\".\nThere are many recipes of how to make a piña colada.\n\nThe IBA specifies\nmixed with crushed ice in blender until smooth, then poured into a chilled glass, garnished and served. Alternately, the three main components can simply be added to a cocktail glass with ice cubes.\n\nAs recounted by his friends in José L. Díaz de Villegas's book, the original Monchito recipe was to pour 85 grams of coconut cream, 170 grams of pineapple juice and 43 grams of white rum into a blender or shaker with crushed ice, blend or shake very well until smooth, then pour into chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry.\nDifferent proportions of the core ingredients, as well as different types of rum, may all be used in the piña colada. Frozen piña coladas are also served. Other named variations include:\nStaten Island Ferry is a cocktail consisting of equal parts Malibu (flavoured rum) and pineapple juice served over ice. In flavor it resembles a Piña Colada (due to the coconut flavor of Malibu rum). As it does not require coconut cream, it is thus more easily prepared in bars that lack the specialty ingredients and blender that a Piña Colada would typically require.\n\nVariants of Blue Hawaii with creme of coconut differ from piña colada mainly by including also blue Curaçao.\n\n"}
{"id": "25065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25065", "title": "Parameter", "text": "Parameter\n\nA parameter (from the Ancient Greek παρά, \"para\": \"beside\", \"subsidiary\"; and μέτρον, \"metron\": \"measure\"), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.\n\n\"Parameter\" has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including mathematics, computing and computer programming, engineering, statistics, logic and linguistics. Within and across these fields, careful distinction must be maintained of the different usages of the term \"parameter\" and of other terms often associated with it, such as argument, property, axiom, variable, function, attribute, etc.\n\nWhen a system is modeled by equations, the values that describe the system are called \"parameters\". For example, in mechanics, the masses, the dimensions and shapes (for solid bodies), the densities and the viscosities (for fluids), appear as parameters in the equations modeling movements. There are often a several choices for the parameters, and choosing a convenient set of parameters is called \"parametrization\". \n\nFor example, if one were considering the movement of an object on the surface of a sphere much larger than the object (e.g. the Earth), there are two commonly used parametrizations of its position: angular coordinates (like latitude/longitude), which neatly describe large movements along circles on the sphere, and directional distance from a known point (e.g. \"10km NNW of Toronto\" or equivalently \"8km due North, and then 6km due West, from Toronto\" ), which are often simpler for movement confined to a (relatively) small area, like within a particular country or region. Such parametrizations are also relevant to the modelization of geographic areas (i.e. map drawing).\n\nMathematical functions have one or more arguments that are designated in the definition by variables. A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general quadratic function by declaring\n\nHere, the variable \"x\" designates the function's argument, but \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-\"b\" logarithm by the formula\nwhere \"b\" is a parameter that indicates which logarithmic function is being used. It is not an argument of the function, and will, for instance, be a constant when considering the derivative formula_3.\n\nIn some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. However, changing the status of symbols between parameter and variable changes the function as a mathematical object. For instance, the notation for the falling factorial power\ndefines a polynomial function of \"n\" (when \"k\" is considered a parameter), but is not a polynomial function of \"k\" (when \"n\" is considered a parameter). Indeed, in the latter case, it is only defined for non-negative integer arguments. More formal presentations of such situations typically start out with a function of several variables (including all those that might sometimes be called \"parameters\") such as\nas the most fundamental object being considered, then defining functions with fewer variables from the main one by means of currying.\n\nSometimes it is useful to consider all functions with certain parameters as \"parametric family\", i.e. as an indexed family of functions. Examples from probability theory are given further below.\n\n\nW.M. Woods ... a mathematician ... writes ... \"... a variable is one of the many things a \"parameter\" is not.\" ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.\n\n[Kilpatrick quoting Woods] \"Now ... the engineers ... change the lever arms of the linkage ... the speed of the car ... will still depend on the pedal position ...\" but in a ... different manner\". You have changed a parameter\"\n\n\nIn the context of a mathematical model, such as a probability distribution, the distinction between variables and parameters was described by Bard as follows:\n\nIn analytic geometry, curves are often given as the image of some function. The argument of the function is invariably called \"the parameter\". A circle of radius 1 centered at the origin can be specified in more than one form:\nHence these equations, which might be called functions elsewhere are in analytic geometry characterized as parametric equations and the independent variables are considered as parameters.\n\nIn mathematical analysis, integrals dependent on a parameter are often considered. These are of the form\nIn this formula, \"t\" is the argument of the function \"F\", and on the right-hand side the \"parameter\" on which the integral depends. When evaluating the integral, \"t\" is held constant, and so it is considered to be a parameter. If we are interested in the value of \"F\" for different values of \"t\", we then consider \"t\" to be a variable. The quantity \"x\" is a \"dummy variable\" or \"variable of integration\" (confusingly, also sometimes called a \"parameter of integration\").\n\nIn statistics and econometrics, the probability framework above still holds, but attention shifts to estimating the parameters of a distribution based on observed data, or testing hypotheses about them. In frequentist estimation parameters are considered \"fixed but unknown\", whereas in Bayesian estimation they are treated as random variables, and their uncertainty is described as a distribution.\n\nIn estimation theory of statistics, \"statistic\" or estimator refers to samples, whereas \"parameter\" or estimand refers to populations, where the samples are taken from. A statistic is a numerical characteristic of a sample that can be used as an estimate of the corresponding parameter, the numerical characteristic of the population from which the sample was drawn.\n\nFor example, the sample mean (estimator), denoted formula_9, can be used as an estimate of the \"mean\" parameter (estimand), denoted \"μ\", of the population from which the sample was drawn. Similarly, the sample variance (estimator), denoted \"S\", can be used to estimate the \"variance\" parameter (estimand), denoted \"σ\", of the population from which the sample was drawn. (Note that the sample standard deviation (\"S\") is not an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (\"σ\"): see Unbiased estimation of standard deviation.)\n\nIt is possible to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of \"non-parametric statistics\" as opposed to the parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.\n\nIn probability theory, one may describe the distribution of a random variable as belonging to a \"family\" of probability distributions, distinguished from each other by the values of a finite number of \"parameters\". For example, one talks about \"a Poisson distribution with mean value λ\". The function defining the distribution (the probability mass function) is:\nThis example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. \"e\" is Euler's number, a fundamental mathematical constant. The parameter λ is the mean number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system. \"k\" is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample. If we want to know the probability of observing \"k\" occurrences, we plug it into the function to get formula_11. Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of \"k\", but the system is always characterized by the same λ.\n\nFor instance, suppose we have a radioactive sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. The measurements exhibit different values of \"k\", and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of \"k\" will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. From measurement to measurement, however, λ remains constant at 5. If we do not alter the system, then the parameter λ is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter λ would increase.\n\nAnother common distribution is the normal distribution, which has as parameters the mean μ and the variance σ².\n\nIn these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance. In such a case, we have a parameterized distribution.\n\nIt is possible to use the sequence of moments (mean, mean square, ...) or cumulants (mean, variance, ...) as parameters for a probability distribution: see Statistical parameter.\n\nIn computing, a parameter is defined as \"a reference or value that is passed to a function, procedure, subroutine, command, or program\". For example, the name of a file, (a parameter), is passed to a computer program, which then performs a specific function; that is, a program may be passed the name of a file on which it will perform the specific function.\n\nIn computer programming, two notions of parameter are commonly used, and are referred to as parameters and arguments—or more formally as a formal parameter and an actual parameter.\n\nFor example, in the definition of a function such as\n\"x\" is the \"formal parameter\" (the \"parameter\") of the defined function.\n\nWhen the function is evaluated for a given value, as in\n3 is the \"actual parameter\" (the \"argument\") for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the \"formal parameter\" of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms \"parameter\" and \"argument\" might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)\n\nThese concepts are discussed in a more precise way in functional programming and its foundational disciplines, lambda calculus and combinatory logic. Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as C define parameter and argument as given here, while Eiffel uses an alternative convention.\n\nIn engineering (especially involving data acquisition) the term \"parameter\" sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. This usage isn't consistent, as sometimes the term \"channel\" refers to an individual measured item, with \"parameter\" referring to the setup information about that channel.\n\n\"Speaking generally, properties are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; parameters are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal.\"\n\nThe term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences.\n\nIn environmental science and particularly in chemistry and microbiology, a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or microbiological entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but may also be a logical entity (present or absent), a statistical result such as a 95%ile value or in some cases a subjective value.\n\nWithin linguistics, the word \"parameter\" is almost exclusively used to denote a binary switch in a Universal Grammar within a Principles and Parameters framework.\n\nIn logic, the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an \"open predicate\" are called \"parameters\" by some authors (e.g., Prawitz, \"Natural Deduction\"; Paulson, \"Designing a theorem prover\"). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called \"variables\". This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate \"variables\", and when defining substitution have to distinguish between \"free variables\" and \"bound variables\".\n\nIn music theory, a parameter denotes an element which may be manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for pitch, loudness, duration, and timbre, though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in serial music, where each parameter may follow some specified series. Paul Lansky and George Perle criticized the extension of the word \"parameter\" to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense, but it remains common. The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).\n\n"}

It can refer to French spoken in Quebec. It may also be used, with an upper- or lower-case initial, as an adjective relating to Quebec, or to the French culture of Quebec. A resident or native of Quebec is often referred to in English as a Quebecer or Quebecker. In French, Québécois or Québécoise usually refers to any native or resident of Quebec. Its use became more prominent in the 1960s as French Canadians from Quebec increasingly self-identified as Québécois.\n\nThe name \"Quebec\" comes from a Mi'kmaq word \"k'webeq\" meaning \"where the waters get narrow\" and originally referred to the area around Quebec City, where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. French explorer Samuel de Champlain chose this name in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of Canada and New France. The Province of Quebec was first founded as a British colony in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 after the Treaty of Paris formally transferred the French colony of New France to Britain after the Seven Years' War. Quebec City remained the capital. In 1774, Guy Carleton obtained from the British Government the Quebec Act, which gave Canadiens most of the territory they held before 1763; the right of religion; and their right of language and culture. The British Government did this to in order to keep their loyalty, in the face of a growing menace of independence from the 13 original British colonies.\n\nThe term became more common in English as \"Québécois\" largely replacing \"French Canadian\" as an expression of cultural and national identity among French Canadians living in Quebec during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. The predominant French Canadian nationalism and identity of previous generations was based on the protection of the French language, the Roman Catholic Church, and Church-run institutions across Canada and in parts of the United States. In contrast, the modern Québécois identity is secular and based on a social democratic ideal of an active Quebec government promoting the French language and French-speaking culture in the arts, education, and business within the Province of Quebec. Politically, this resulted in a push towards more autonomy for Quebec and an internal debate on Quebec independence and identity that continues to this day. The emphasis on the French language and Quebec autonomy means that French-speakers across Canada now self-identify more specifically with provincial or regional identity-tags, such as \"acadienne\", or \"franco-canadienne\", \"franco-manitobaine\", \"franco-ontarienne\" or \"fransaskoise\". Terms such as Franco-Ontarian, acadian and Franco-Manitoban are still predominant. Francophones and anglophones use many terms when discussing issues of francophone linguistic and cultural identity in English.\n\nThe political shift towards a new Quebec nationalism in the 1960s led to Québécois increasingly referring to provincial institutions as being national. This was reflected in the change of the provincial \"Legislative Assembly\" to \"National Assembly\" in 1968. Nationalism reached an apex the 1970s and 1990s, with contentious constitutional debates resulting in close to half of all of French-speaking Québécois seeking recognition of nation status through tight referendums on Quebec sovereignty in 1980 and 1995. Having lost both referendums, the sovereigntist Parti Québécois government renewed the push for recognition as a nation through symbolic motions that gained the support of all parties in the National Assembly. They affirmed the right to determine the independent status of Quebec. They also renamed the area around Quebec City the \"Capitale-Nationale\" (national capital) region and renamed provincial parks \"Parcs Nationaux\" (national parks). In opposition in October 2003, the Parti Québécois tabled a motion that was unanimously adopted in the National Assembly affirming that the Quebec people formed a nation. Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe scheduled a similar motion in the House of Commons for November 23, 2006, that would have recognized \"Quebecers as a nation\". Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper tabled the \"Québécois nation motion\" the day before the Bloc Québécois resolution came to a vote. The English version changed the word \"Quebecer\" to \"Québécois\" and added \"within a united Canada\" at the end of the Bloc motion.\n\nThe \"Québécois nation\" was recognized by the House of Commons of Canada on November 27, 2006. The Prime Minister specified that the motion used the \"\"cultural\"\" and \"\"sociological\"\" as opposed to the \"\"legal\"\" sense of the word \"\"nation\"\". According to Harper, the motion was of a symbolic political nature, representing no constitutional change, no recognition of Quebec sovereignty, and no legal change in its political relations within the federation. The Prime Minister has further elaborated, stating that the motion's definition of Québécois relies on personal decisions to self-identify as Québécois, and therefore is a personal choice.\n\nDespite near-universal support in the House of Commons, several important dissenters criticized the motion. Intergovernmental Affairs minister Michael Chong resigned from his position and abstained from voting, arguing that this motion was too ambiguous and had the potential of recognizing a destructive ethnic nationalism in Canada. Liberals were the most divided on the issue and represented 15 of the 16 votes against the motion. Liberal MP Ken Dryden summarized the view of many of these dissenters, maintaining that it was a game of semantics that cheapened issues of national identity. A survey by Leger Marketing in November 2006 showed that Canadians were deeply divided on this issue. When asked if Québécois are a nation, only 53 per cent of Canadians agreed, 47 per cent disagreed, with 33 per cent strongly disagreeing; 78 per cent of French-speaking Canadians agreed that Québécois are a nation, compared with 38 per cent of English-speaking Canadians. As well, 78 per cent of 1,000 Québécois polled thought that Québécois should be recognized as a nation.\n\nThe Québécois self-identify as an ethnic group in both the English and French versions of the Canadian census and in demographic studies of ethnicity in Canada.\n\nIn the 2016 census, 74,575 chose Québécois as one of multiple responses with 119,985 choosing it as a single response (194,555 as a combined response).\n\nIn the 2001 Census of Canada, 98,670 Canadians, or just over 1% of the population of Quebec identified \"Québécois\" as their ethnicity, ranking \"Québécois\" as the 37th most common response. These results were based on a question on residents in each household in Canada: \"\"To which ethnic or cultural group(s) did this person's ancestors belong?\"\", along with a list of sample choices (\"Québécois\" did not appear among the various sample choices). The ethnicity\"\"Canadien\"\" or Canadian, did appear as an example on the questionnaire, and was selected by 4.9 million people or 68.2% of the Quebec population.\n\nIn the more detailed \"Ethnic Diversity Survey\",\nQuébécois was the most common ethnic identity in Quebec, reported by 37% of\nQuebec's population aged 15 years and older, either as their only identity or alongside\nother identities. The survey, based on interviews, asked the following questions: \"\"1) I would now like to ask you about your ethnic ancestry, heritage or background. What were the ethnic or cultural origins of your ancestors? 2) In addition to \"Canadian\", what were the other ethnic or cultural origins of your ancestors on first coming to North America?\"\" This survey did not list possible choices of ancestry and permitted multiple answers.\nIn census ethnic surveys, French-speaking Canadians identify their ethnicity most often as French, \"Canadien\", \"Québécois\", or French Canadian, with the latter three referred to by Jantzen (2005) as \"French New World\" ancestries because they originate in Canada. Jantzen (2005) distinguishes the English \"Canadian\", meaning \"someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations\", and the French \"Canadien\", used to refer to descendants of the original settlers of New France in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThose reporting \"French New World\" ancestries overwhelmingly had ancestors that went back at least 4 generations in Canada: specifically, 90% of \"Québécois\" traced their ancestry back this far. Fourth generation Canadiens and Québécois showed considerable attachment to their ethno-cultural group, with 70% and 61% respectively reporting a strong sense of belonging.\n\nThe generational profile and strength of identity of French New World ancestries contrast with those of British or Canadian ancestries, which represent the largest ethnic identities in Canada. Although deeply rooted Canadians express a deep attachment to their ethnic identity, most English-speaking Canadians of British ancestry generally cannot trace their ancestry as far back in Canada as French-speakers. As a result, their identification with their ethnicity is weaker tending to have a more broad based cultural identification: for example, only 50% of third generation \"Canadians\" strongly identify as such, bringing down the overall average. The survey report notes that 80% of Canadians whose families had been in Canada for three or more generations reported \"Canadian and provincial or regional ethnic identities\". These identities include \"Québécois\" (37% of Quebec population), \"Acadian\" (6% of Atlantic provinces) and \"Newfoundlander\" (38% of Newfoundland and Labrador).\n\nEnglish expressions employing the term may imply specific reference to francophones; such as \"Québécois music\", \"a Québécois rocker\" or \"Québécois literature\".\n\nThe dictionary \"Le Petit Robert\", published in France, states that the adjective \"québécois\", in addition to its territorial meaning, may refer specifically to francophone or French Canadian culture in Quebec. The dictionary gives as examples \"cinéma québécois\" and \"littérature québécoise\".\n\nHowever, an ethnic or linguistic sense is absent from \"Le Petit Larousse, also published in France, as well as from French dictionaries published in Canada such as \"Le Dictionnaire québécois d'aujourd'hui\" and \"Le Dictionnaire du français Plus\", which indicate instead \"Québécois francophone\" \"francophone Quebecer\" in the linguistic sense.\n\nThe online dictionary \"Grand dictionnaire terminologique\" of the Office québécois de la langue française mentions only a territorial meaning for \"Québécois\".\n\nNewspaper editor Lysiane Gagnon has referred to an ethnic sense of the word \"Québécois\" in both English and French.\n\nFrench expressions employing \"Québécois\" often appear in both French and English.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25519", "title": "Reich", "text": "Reich\n\nReich (; ) is a German word analogous in meaning to the English word \"realm\". The terms ' (literally \"realm of an emperor\") and ' (literally \"realm of a king\") are used in German to refer to empires and kingdoms respectively. The \"Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary\" indicates that in English usage, the term \"the Reich\" refers to \"Germany during the period of Nazi control from 1933 to 1945\".\n\nThe term \"Deutsches Reich\" (sometimes translated to \"German Empire\") continued to be used even after the collapse of the German Empire and abolition of the monarchy in 1918. There was no emperor, but many Germans had imperialistic ambitions. According to Richard J. Evans:\n\nThe continued use of the term 'German Empire', \"Deutsches Reich,\" by the Weimar Republic... conjured up an image among educated Germans that resonated far beyond the institutional structures Bismarck created: the successor to the Roman Empire; the vision of God's Empire here on earth; the universality of its claim to suzerainty; and a more prosaic but no less powerful sense, the concept of a German state that would include all German speakers in central Europe--'one People, one Reich, one Leader', as the Nazi slogan was to put it.\n\nThe term derives from the Germanic word meaning \"realm\" in general, but is typically used in German to designate a kingdom or an empire, especially the Roman Empire. The terms ' (roughly \"Emperordom\") and ' are used in German to more specifically define an empire ruled by an emperor.\n\n\"Reich\" is comparable in meaning and development (as well as descending from the same Proto-Indo-European root) to the English word \"realm\" (via French \"reaume\" \"kingdom\" from Latin \"regalis\" \"royal\"). It is used for historical empires in general, such as the Roman Empire ('), Persian Empire ('), and both the Tsardom of Russia and the Russian Empire (', literally \"Tsar realm\"). The Eastern Realm (') of the Holy Roman Empire is still the name used today for Austria.\n\nIn the history of Germany specifically, it is used to refer to:\n\nThe term \"Third Reich\" was adopted by the Nazis as propaganda to legitimize their government as a successor to the retroactively renamed \"First\" and \"Second\" Reichs. The terms \"First Reich\" and \"Second Reich\" are not used by historians, whilst the term \"Fourth Reich\" is used mainly in fiction and for political humour; however, it also used by those who subscribe to the belief of Neo-Nazism or the belief of \"\"Aryan Supremacy\".\"\n\nThe Latin equivalent of \"Reich\" is ' or rather with a king '. Both terms translate to \"rule, sovereignty, government\", usually of monarchs (kings or emperors), but also of gods, and of the Christian God. The German version of the Lord's Prayer uses the words \"\" for \"\" (usually translated as \"thy kingdom come\" in English).\n\n\"Himmelreich\" is the German term for the concept of \"kingdom of heaven\".\n\nThe German noun \"Reich\" is derived from Old High German \"rīhhi\", which together with its cognates in Old English \"rīce\" Old Norse \"ríki\" (modern Scandinavian \"rike\"/\"rige\") and Gothic \"reiki\" is from a Common Germanic \"*rīkijan\".\nThe English noun is obsolete, but persists in composition, for example in \"bishopric\".\n\nThe German adjective \"\", on the other hand, has an exact cognate in English rich. Both the noun (\"*rīkijan\") and the adjective (\"*rīkijaz\") are derivations based on a Common Germanic \"*rīks\" \"ruler, king\", reflected in Gothic as \"reiks\", glossing \"leader, ruler, chieftain\".\n\nIt is probable that the Germanic word was not inherited from pre-Proto-Germanic, but rather loaned from Celtic (i.e. Gaulish \"rīx\", Welsh \"rhi\", both meaning 'king') at an early time.\n\nThe word has many cognates outside of Germanic and Celtic, notably Latin \"rex\" and Sanskrit \"Raj\" \"rule\". It is ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root \"*reg-\", meaning \"to straighten out or rule\".\n\n\"Frankenreich\" or \"Fränkisches Reich\" is the German name given to the Frankish Kingdom of Charlemagne. \n\"Frankenreich\" came to be used of Western Francia and medieval France after the development of Eastern Francia into the Holy Roman Empire.\nThe German name of France, \"Frankreich\", is a contraction of \"Frankenreich\" used in reference to the kingdom of France from the late medieval period.\n\nThe term \"Reich\" was part of the German names for Germany for much of its history. Reich was used by itself in the common German variant of the Holy Roman Empire, ('). \"Der rîche\" was a title for the Emperor. However, Latin, not German, was the formal legal language of the medieval Empire ('), so English-speaking historians are more likely to use Latin ' than German ' as a term for this period of German history. The common contemporary Latin legal term used in documents of the Holy Roman Empire was for a long time \"regnum\" (\"rule, domain, empire\", such as in \"Regnum Francorum\" for the Frankish Kingdom) before \"imperium\" was in fact adopted, the latter first attested in 1157, whereas the parallel use of \"regnum\" never fell out of use during the Middle Ages.\n\nAt the beginning of the modern age, some circles redubbed the HRE into the \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" (\"), a symptom of the formation of a German nation state as opposed to the multinational state the Empire was throughout its history.\n\nResistance against the French revolution with its concept of the state brought a new movement to create a German \"ethnical state\", especially after the Napoleonic wars. Ideal for this state was the Holy Roman Empire; the legend arose that Germany were \"un-defeated when unified\", especially after the Franco-Prussian War (\", lit. \"German-French war\"). Before that, the German question ruptured this \"German unity\" after the 1848 Revolution before it was achieved, however; Austria-Hungary as a multinational state could not become part of the new \"German empire\", and nationality conflicts in Prussia with the Prussian Poles arose (\"We can never be Germans – Prussians, every time!\").\n\nThe advent of national feeling and the movement to create an ethnically German Empire did lead directly to nationalism in 1871. Ethnic minorities declined since the beginning of the modern age; the Polabs, Sorbs and even the once important Low Germans had to assimilate themselves. This marked the transition between Antijudaism, where converted Jews were accepted as full citizens (in theory), to Antisemitism, where Jews were thought to be from a different ethnicity that could never become German. Apart from all those ethnic minorities being de facto extinct, even today the era of national feeling is taught in history in German schools as an important stepping-stone on the road to a German nation.\n\nIn the case of the Hohenzollern Empire (1871–1918), the official name of the country was \"Deutsches Reich\" (\"German Realm\"), because under the Constitution of the German Empire, it was legally a confederation of German states under the permanent presidency of the King of Prussia. The constitution granted the King of Prussia the title of \"German Emperor\" (\"Deutscher Kaiser\"), but this referred to the German nation rather than directly to the \"state\" of Germany.\n\nThe exact translation of the term \"German Empire\" would be \"Deutsches Kaiserreich\". This name was sometimes used informally for Germany between 1871 and 1918, but it was disliked by the first German Emperor, Wilhelm I, and never became official.\n\nThe unified Germany which arose under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1871 was the first entity that was officially called in German \"\". \"Deutsches Reich\" remained the official name of Germany until 1945, although these years saw three very different political systems more commonly referred to in English as: \"the German Empire\" (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–1933; this term is a pre-World War II coinage not used at the time), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945).\n\nAfter 1918 \"Reich\" was usually not translated as \"Empire\" in English-speaking countries, and the title was instead simply used in its original German. During the Weimar Republic the term ' and the prefix ' referred not to the idea of empire but rather to the institutions, officials, affairs etc. of the whole country as opposed to those of one of its constituent federal states ('), in the same way that the terms ' (federation) and \"\" (federal) are used in Germany today, and comparable to \"The Crown\" in Commonwealth countries and \"The Union\" in the United States.\n\nThe Nazis sought to legitimize their power historiographically by portraying their ascendancy to rule as the direct continuation of an ancient German past. They adopted the term \"\" (\"Third Empire\" – usually rendered in English in the partial translation \"the Third Reich\"), first used in a 1923 book entitled \"Das Dritte Reich\" by Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, that counted the medieval Holy Roman Empire (which nominally survived until the 19th century) as the first and the 1871–1918 monarchy as the second, which was then to be followed by a \"reinvigorated\" third one. This ignored the previous 1918–1933 Weimar period, which the Nazis denounced as a historical aberration, contemptuously referring to it as \"the System\". In the summer of 1939 the Nazis themselves actually banned the continued use of the term in the press, ordering it to use expressions such as \"nationalsozialistisches Deutschland\" (\"National Socialist Germany\"), \"Großdeutsches Reich\" (\"Greater German Reich\"), or simply \"Deutsches Reich\" (German Reich) to refer to the German state instead. It was Adolf Hitler's personal desire that \"Großdeutsches Reich\" and \"nationalsozialistischer Staat\" (\"[the] National Socialist State\") would be used in place of \"Drittes Reich\". \"Reichskanzlei Berchtesgaden\" (\"Reich Chancellery Berchtesgaden\"), another nickname of the regime (named after the eponymous town located in the vicinity of Hitler's mountain residence where he spent much of his time in office) was also banned at the same time, despite the fact that a sub-section of the Chancellery was in fact installed there to serve Hitler's needs.\n\nAlthough the term \"Third Reich\" is still in common use to refer to this historical period, the terms \"First Reich\" and \"Second Reich\" for the earlier periods are seldom found outside Nazi propaganda. To use the terms \"First Reich\" and \"Second Reich\", as some commentators did in the post-war years, is generally frowned upon as accepting Nazi historiography. During and following the Anschluss (annexation) of Austria in 1938 Nazi propaganda also used the political slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer\" (\"One people, one \"Reich\", one leader\"), in order to enforce pan-German sentiment. The term ' (\"old Reich\"; cf. French \"ancien regime\" for monarchical France) is sometimes used to refer to the Holy Roman Empire. The term ' was also used after the Anschluss to denote Germany with its pre-1938 post-World War I borders. Another name that was popular during this period was the term \"Tausendjähriges Reich\" (\"Thousand-Year Reich\"), the millennial connotations of which suggested that Nazi Germany would last for a thousand years.\n\nThe Nazis also spoke of enlarging the then-established Greater German Reich into a \"Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation\" (\"Großgermanisches Reich Deutscher Nation\") by gradually annexing all the historically Germanic countries and regions of Europe (Flanders, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden etc.) directly into the Nazi state.\n\nA number of previously neutral words used by the Nazis have later taken on negative connotations in German (e.g. ' or '); while in many contexts ' is not one of them (\"Frankreich\", France; \"Römisches Reich\", Roman Empire), it can imply German imperialism or strong nationalism if it is used to describe a political or governmental entity. ' has thus not been used in official terminology since 1945, though it is still found in the name of the Reichstag building, which since 1999 has housed the German federal parliament, the Bundestag. The decision not to rename the Reichstag building was taken only after long debate in the Bundestag; even then, it is described officially as \"\" (Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag). As seen in this example, the term \"Bund\" (federation) has replaced \"Reich\" in the names of various state institutions such as the army (\"Bundeswehr\"). The term \"Reichstag\" also remains in use in the German language as the term for the parliaments of some foreign monarchies, such as Sweden's Riksdag and Japan's pre-war Imperial Diet.\n\nThe exception is that during the Cold War, the East German railway incongruously continued to use the name \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" (German Reich Railways), which had been the name of the national railway during the Weimar Republic and the Nazi era. Even after German reunification in October 1990, the Reichsbahn continued to exist for over three years as the operator of the railroad in eastern Germany, ending finally on 1 January 1994 when the Reichsbahn and the western Deutsche Bundesbahn were merged to form the privatized Deutsche Bahn AG.\n\nThe early medieval form of the word, used in the sense \"strong\", \"powerful\" or \"ruler\", appears as an element in many male personal names from the Germanic heroic tradition, such as Richard (strong heart), Dietrich (ruler of the people), Heinrich (ruler of the home), or Friedrich (guardian of the peace).\n\nThe cognate of the word Reich is used in all the Scandinavian languages with the identical meaning, i.e. \"realm\". It is spelled rike in Swedish and modern Norwegian and rige in Danish and older Norwegian (before the 1907 spelling reform). The word is traditionally used for sovereign entities, generally simply means \"country\" or \"nation\" (in the sense of a sovereign state) and does not have any special or political connotations. It does not imply any particular form of government, but it does imply that the entity is both of a certain size and of a certain standing, like the Scandinavian kingdoms themselves; hence the word might be considered exaggerated for very small states, like a city-state. Its use as a stand-alone word is more widespread than in contemporary German, but most often it refers to the three Scandinavian states themselves and certain historical empires, like the Roman Empire; the standard word for a \"country\" is usually \"land\" and there are many other words used to refer to countries. The word is part of the official names of Denmark, Norway and Sweden in the form of \"kongerike\" (Norwegian), \"kongerige\" (Danish) and \"konungarike\" (Swedish), all meaning kingdom, or literally the \"realm of a king\" (a kingdom can also be called \"kongedømme\" in Danish and Norwegian and \"kungadöme\" in Swedish, direct cognates of the English word). Two regions in Norway that were petty kingdoms before the unification of Norway around 900 AD have retained the word in the names (see Ringerike and Romerike).\n\nThe word is also used in \"Svea rike\", with the current spelling \"Sverige,\" the name of Sweden in Swedish. Thus in the official name of Sweden, \"Konungariket Sverige\", the word \"rike\" appears twice.\n\nThe derived prefix \"riks-\" (Swedish and Norwegian) and \"rigs-\" (Danish and pre-1907 Norwegian) implies nationwide or under central jurisdiction. Examples include \"riksväg\" and \"riksvei\", names for a national road in Swedish and Norwegian. It is also present in the names of numerous institutions in all the Scandinavian countries. It is used in words such as \"utrikes\" (Swedish), \"utenriks\" (Norwegian) and \"udenrigs\" (Danish), relating to foreign countries and other things from abroad. The opposite word is \"inrikes\"/\"innenriks\"/\"indenrigs\", meaning domestic.\n\nThe Lord's Prayer uses the word in the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish versions: \"Tillkomme ditt rike\", \"Komme ditt rike\", \"Komme dit rige\" ('Thy kingdom come' – old versions). \"Låt ditt rike komma!\", \"La ditt rike komme\", \"Komme dit rige\" ('Let your kingdom come' – new versions).\n\n\"Riik\" is also an Estonian word for country and realm.\n\n\"Rike\" is also a now-archaic English word cognate with \"reich\".\n\nRijk is the Dutch and ryk the Afrikaans equivalent of German \"Reich\".\n\nIn a political sense in the Netherlands and Belgium the word \"rijk\" often connotes a connection with the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Belgium as opposed to the European part of the country or as opposed to provincial or municipal governments; the \"ministerraad\" is the executive body of the Netherlands' government and the \"rijksministerraad\" that of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a similar distinction is found in \"wetten\" (laws) versus \"rijkswetten\" (kingdom laws), or the now-abolished \"rijkswacht\" for gendarmerie in Belgium. The word \"rijk\" can also be found in institutions like Rijkswaterstaat, Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu, and Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.\n\nIn Afrikaans, \"ryk\" refers to rulership and area of governance (mostly a kingdom), but in a modern sense the term is used in a much more figurative sense (e.g. \"Die Hemelse Ryk\" (the heavenly kingdom, China)), as the sphere under one's control or influence, such as:\n\nLike in German, the adjective \"rijk\"/\"ryk\" means \"rich\".\n\n"}

Its most popular variety is the \"rosół z kury\", or clear chicken soup. It is commonly served with capellini pasta. A vegetarian version can be made, substituting meat with oil or butter.\n\nIt is one of the most popular Polish soups and is served during family dinners as well as a traditional soup for weddings. It is also said to be a great remedy if one catches a cold. The name \"\"rosół\"\" derives from a dish made of salted meat (an old conservation method) cooked in water to make it more edible. Later on, fresh meat was used instead. Over time the dish evolved to that of cooked meat in a soup that is commonly known today.\n\nThere are many types of \"rosół\", as:\n\"Rosół Królewski\" (The royal rosół), made of three meats: beef or veal, white poultry (hen, turkey or chicken) and dark poultry as duck, goose (crob only), just a couple of dried king boletes, one single cabbage leaf and a variety of vegetables such as parsley, celery, carrot, and leek. The cooking must take at least six hours of sensitive boiling over a small fire. At the end, softly burnt onion is added to the soup.\n\n\"Rosół myśliwski\" (The hunter's rosół) is made of a variety of wild birds as well as pheasant, capercaillie, wood grouse, black grouse, or grey partridge, with a small addition of roe deer meat, a couple of wild mushrooms, and 2-3 juniper fruits. Instead of wild poultry, helmeted guinea fowl can also be used.\n\nThe most important thing about making \"rosół\" is that there can be no addition of pork, since that would no longer make the broth clear. It cannot be boiled too quickly for the same reason.\n\nThis is the way to cook Polish rosół: take beef meat or veal,\nhazel grouse or partridge, and whatever meat that in rosół can be cooked.\nSoak it, lay in pot, then strain and pour over meat, add parsley, butter, salt, and skim well.\nOne has to know what to put in the rosół for it not to smell.\nthat is parsley, dill, onion or garlic, nutmeg or rosmarin or pepper to taste.\nLime would not spoil any rosół as well.\n"}

{"id": "26918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26918", "title": "Submarine sandwich", "text": "Submarine sandwich\n\nA submarine sandwich, also known as a sub, hoagie, hero, grinder, po'boy or Italian sandwich, is the name given in the United States to a type of sandwich that consists of a length of bread or roll split lengthwise and filled with a variety of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments. The sandwich has no standardized name, with over a dozen variations used around the world. Larger submarine sandwiches, particularly those that are longer in length or overstuffed with greater quantities of ingredients than usual, are sometimes called battleship sandwiches, flattop sandwiches or destroyer sandwiches.\n\nThe terms \"submarine\" and \"sub\" are widespread and not assignable to any certain region, though many of the localized terms are clustered in the northeastern United States.\n\nThe Italian sandwich originated in several different Italian American communities in the Northeastern United States from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. Portland, Maine, claims to be the birthplace of the Italian sandwich and it is considered Maine's signature sandwich. The popularity of this Italian-American cuisine has grown from its origins in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island to most parts of the United States and Canada, and with the advent of chain restaurants, is now available in many parts of the world.\n\nThe use of the term \"submarine\" or \"sub\" (after the resemblance of the roll to the shape of a submarine) is widespread. While some accounts source the name as originating in New London, Connecticut (site of the United States Navy's primary submarine base) during World War II, written advertisements from 1940 in Wilmington, Delaware, indicate the term originated prior to the United States' entry into World War II.\n\nOne theory says the submarine was brought to the U.S. by Dominic Conti (1874–1954), an Italian immigrant who came to New York in the early 1900s. He is said to have named it after seeing the recovered 1901 submarine called \"Fenian Ram\" in the Paterson Museum of New Jersey in 1928. His granddaughter has stated the following:\n\nThe term \"hoagie\" originated in the Philadelphia area. \"The Philadelphia Bulletin\" reported, in 1953, that Italians working at the World War I–era shipyard in Philadelphia known as Hog Island, where emergency shipping was produced for the war effort, introduced the sandwich by putting various meats, cheeses, and lettuce between two slices of bread. This became known as the \"Hog Island\" sandwich; shortened to \"Hoggies\", then the \"hoagie\".\n\nThe \"Philadelphia Almanac and Citizen's Manual\" offers a different explanation, that the sandwich was created by early-twentieth-century street vendors called \"hokey-pokey men\", who sold antipasto salad, meats, cookies and buns with a cut in them. When Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" opened in Philadelphia in 1879, bakeries produced a long loaf called the pinafore. Entrepreneurial \"hokey-pokey men\" sliced the loaf in half, stuffed it with antipasto salad, and sold the world's first \"hoagie\".\n\nAnother explanation is that the word \"hoagie\" arose in the late 19th to early 20th century, among the Italian community in South Philadelphia, when \"on the hoke\" was a slang term used to describe a destitute person. Deli owners would give away scraps of cheeses and meats in an Italian bread-roll known as a \"hokie\", but the Italian immigrants pronounced it \"hoagie\".\n\nShortly after World War II, there were numerous varieties of the term in use throughout Philadelphia. By the 1940s, the spellings \"hoagie\" and, to a lesser extent, \"hoagy\", had come to dominate less-used variations like \"hoogie\" and \"hoggie\". By 1955, restaurants throughout the area were using the term \"hoagie\". Listings in Pittsburgh show hoagies arriving in 1961 and becoming widespread in that city by 1966.\n\nFormer Philadelphia mayor (and later Pennsylvania governor) Ed Rendell declared the hoagie the \"Official Sandwich of Philadelphia\". However, there are claims that the hoagie was actually a product of nearby Chester, Pennsylvania. DiCostanza's in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, claims that the mother of DiConstanza's owner originated the hoagie in 1925 in Chester. DiCostanza relates the story that a customer came into the family deli and through an exchange matching the customer's requests and the deli's offerings, the hoagie was created.\n\nWoolworth's to-go sandwich was called a \"hoagie\" in all U.S. stores.\n\nBánh mì sandwiches are sometimes referred to as \"Vietnamese hoagies\" in Philadelphia.\n\nThe New York term \"hero\" is first attested in 1937. The name is sometimes credited to the \"New York Herald Tribune\" food writer Clementine Paddleford in the 1930s, but there is no good evidence for this. It is also sometimes claimed that it is related to the \"gyro\", but this is unlikely as the \"gyro\" was unknown in the United States until the 1960s, according to sources.\n\n\"Hero\" (plural usually \"\", not \"heroes\") remains the prevailing New York City term for most sandwiches on an oblong roll with a generally Italian flavor, in addition to the original described above. Pizzeria menus often include eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, and meatball , each served with sauce.\n\nA common term in New England, its origin has several possibilities. One theory has the name coming from Italian-American slang for a dock worker, among whom the sandwich was popular. Others say it was called a grinder because it took a lot of chewing to eat the hard crust of the bread used.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware, and parts of New England, the term \"grinder\" usually refers to a \"hot\" submarine sandwich (meatball; sausage; etc.), whereas a cold sandwich (e.g., cold cuts) is usually just simply called a \"sub\".\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, the term \"grinder\" is also applied to any hoagie (whether or not it is made with traditionally hot ingredients) that is toasted in the oven after assembly.\n\nThe term \"wedge\" is used in Westchester County, New York, Putnam County, New York, Dutchess County, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut – four counties directly north of New York City.\n\nSome base the name \"wedge\" on a diagonal cut in the middle of the sandwich, creating two halves or \"wedges\", or a \"wedge\" cut out of the top half of the bread with the fillings \"wedged\" in between, or a sandwich that is served between two \"wedges\" of bread. It has also been said \"wedge\" is just short for \"sandwich\", with the name having originated from an Italian deli owner located in Yonkers, who got tired of saying the whole word.\n\nThe term \"spukie\" (\"spukkie\" or \"spuckie\") is unique to the city of Boston and derives from the Italian word \"spuccadella\", meaning \"long roll\". The word \"spucadella\" is not typically found in Italian dictionaries, which may suggest that it could be a regional Italian dialect, or possibly a Boston Italian-American innovation. Spukie is typically heard in parts of Dorchester and South Boston. Some bakeries in Boston's North End neighborhood have homemade spucadellas for sale.\n\n\nRolls filled with condiments have been common in several European countries for more than a century, notably in France and Scotland.\n\nIn the United States, from its origins with the Italian American labor force in the northeast, the sub began to show up on menus of local pizzerias. As time went on and popularity grew, small restaurants, called hoagie shops and sub shops, that specialized in the sandwich began to open.\n\nSubs or their national equivalents were already popular in many European, Asian and Australasian countries when late 20th-century franchisee chain restaurants and fast food made them even more popular and increased the prevalence of the word \"sub\". Many outlets offer non-traditional ingredient combinations.\n\nIn the United States, many chain restaurants have arisen that specialize in subs including Capriotti's, Submarina, Jersey Mike's Subs, Charley's Grilled Subs, Blimpie, Jimmy John's, Lenny's Sub Shop, Milio's Sandwiches, Port of Subs, Eegee's, Firehouse Subs, Penn Station, Planet Sub, Potbelly, Togo's, Tubby's, Which Wich? and D'Angelo Sandwich Shops. Major international chains include Quiznos, Mr. Sub and the largest restaurant chain in the world, Subway. The sandwich is also often available at supermarkets and convenience stores, such as Wawa, who annually run a sub promotional event during the summer called Hoagiefest.\n\n"}
{"id": "27178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27178", "title": "Shoe", "text": "Shoe\n\nA shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot while the wearer is doing various activities. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion. The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with appearance originally being tied to function. Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones. Contemporary footwear in the 2010s varies widely in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost. High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars a pair. Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing.\n\nTraditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, but in the 2010s, they are increasingly made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials. Though the human foot is adapted to varied terrain and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-soled boots which are required on construction sites.\n\nThe earliest known shoes are sagebrush bark sandals dating from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC, found in the Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon in 1938. The world's oldest leather shoe, made from a single piece of cowhide laced with a leather cord along seams at the front and back, was found in the Areni-1 cave complex in Armenia in 2008 and is believed to date to 3500 BC. Ötzi the Iceman's shoes, dating to 3300 BC, featured brown bearskin bases, deerskin side panels, and a bark-string net, which pulled tight around the foot. The Jotunheimen shoe was discovered in August 2006. Archaeologists estimate that the leather shoe was made between 1800 and 1100 BC, making it the oldest article of clothing discovered in Scandinavia.\n\nIt is thought that shoes may have been used long before this, but because the materials used were highly perishable, it is difficult to find evidence of the earliest footwear. By studying the bones of the smaller toes (as opposed to the big toe), it was observed that their thickness decreased approximately 40,000 to 26,000 years ago. This led archaeologists to deduce that wearing shoes resulted in less bone growth, resulting in shorter, thinner toes. These earliest designs were very simple in design, often mere \"foot bags\" of leather to protect the feet from rocks, debris, and cold. They were more commonly found in colder climates.\n\nMany early natives in North America wore a similar type of footwear, known as the moccasin. These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes typically made out of leather or bison hides. Many moccasins were also decorated with various beads and other adornments. Moccasins were not designed to be waterproof, and in wet weather and warm summer months, most Native Americans went barefoot.\n\nAs civilizations began to develop, thong sandals (the precursors of the modern flip-flop) were worn. This practice dates back to pictures of them in ancient Egyptian murals from 4000 BC. One pair found in Europe was made of papyrus leaves and dated to be approximately 1,500 years old. They were also worn in Jerusalem during the first century of the Common Era. Thong sandals were worn by many civilizations and made from a wide variety of materials. Ancient Egyptian sandals were made from papyrus and palm leaves. The Masai of Africa made them out of rawhide. In India they were made from wood. In China and Japan, rice straw was used. The leaves of the sisal plant were used to make twine for sandals in South America while the natives of Mexico used the Yucca plant.\n\nWhile thong sandals were commonly worn, many people in ancient times, such as the Egyptians, Hindus and Greeks, saw little need for footwear, and most of the time, preferred being barefoot. The Egyptians and Hindus made some use of ornamental footwear, such as a soleless sandal known as a \"Cleopatra\", which did not provide any practical protection for the foot. The ancient Greeks largely viewed footwear as self-indulgent, unaesthetic and unnecessary. Shoes were primarily worn in the theater, as a means of increasing stature, and many preferred to go barefoot. Athletes in the Ancient Olympic Games participated barefoot – and naked. Even the gods and heroes were primarily depicted barefoot, the hoplite warriors fought battles in bare feet and Alexander the Great conquered his vast empire with barefoot armies. The runners of Ancient Greece are also believed to have run barefoot. Pheidippides, the first marathoner, ran from Athens to Sparta in less than 36 hours. After the Battle of Marathon, he ran straight from the battlefield to Athens to inform the Athenians of the news.\n\nThe Romans, who eventually conquered the Greeks and adopted many aspects of their culture, did not adopt the Greek perception of footwear and clothing. Roman clothing was seen as a sign of power, and footwear was seen as a necessity of living in a civilized world, although the slaves and paupers usually went barefoot. Roman soldiers were issued with chiral (left and right shoe different) footwear. There are references to shoes being worn in the Bible.\n\nA common casual shoe in the Pyrenees during the Middle Ages was the espadrille. This is a sandal with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often includes fabric laces that tie around the ankle. The term is French and comes from the esparto grass. The shoe originated in the Catalonian region of Spain as early as the 13th century, and was commonly worn by peasants in the farming communities in the area.\n\nMany medieval shoes were made using the turnshoe method of construction, in which the upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some shoes were developed with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather around the foot for a better fit. Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely, with the right and left shoe being mirror images. Around 1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method (where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be turned inside-out). The turnshoe method is still used for some dance and specialty shoes.\n\nBy the 15th Century, pattens became popular by both men and women in Europe. These are commonly seen as the predecessor of the modern high-heeled shoe, while the poor and lower classes in Europe, as well as slaves in the New World, were barefoot. In the 15th century, the Crakow was fashionable in Europe. This style of shoe is named because it is thought to have originated in Kraków, the capital of Poland. The style is characterized by the point of the shoe, known as the \"polaine\", which often was supported by a whalebone tied to the knee to prevent the point getting in the way while walking. Also during the 15th century, chopines were created in Turkey, and were usually 7-8 inches (17.7-20.3 cm) high. These shoes became popular in Venice and throughout Europe, as a status symbol revealing wealth and social standing. During the 16th century, royalty started wearing high-heeled shoes to make them look taller or larger than life, such as Catherine de Medici or Mary I of England. By 1580, even men wore them, and a person with authority or wealth was often referred to as, \"well-heeled\".\n\nEventually the modern shoe, with a sewn-on sole, was devised. Since the 17th century, most leather shoes have used a sewn-on sole. This remains the standard for finer-quality dress shoes today. Until around 1800, welted rand shoes were commonly made without differentiation for the left or right foot. Such shoes are now referred to as \"straights\". Only gradually did the modern foot-specific shoe become standard.\n\nShoemaking became more commercialized in the mid-18th century, as it expanded as a cottage industry. Large warehouses began to stock footwear, made by many small manufacturers from the area.\n\nUntil the 19th century, shoemaking was a traditional handicraft, but by the century's end, the process had been almost completely mechanized, with production occurring in large factories. Despite the obvious economic gains of mass-production, the factory system produced shoes without the individual differentiation that the traditional shoemaker was able to provide.\n\nThe first steps towards mechanisation were taken during the Napoleonic Wars by the engineer, Marc Brunel. He developed machinery for the mass-production of boots for the soldiers of the British Army. In 1812 he devised a scheme for making nailed-boot-making machinery that automatically fastened soles to uppers by means of metallic pins or nails. With the support of the Duke of York, the shoes were manufactured, and, due to their strength, cheapness, and durability, were introduced for the use of the army. In the same year, the use of screws and staples was patented by Richard Woodman. Brunel's system was described by Sir Richard Phillips as a visitor to his factory in Battersea as follows:\n\nHowever, when the war ended in 1815, manual labour became much cheaper, and the demand for military equipment subsided. As a consequence, Brunel's system was no longer profitable and it soon ceased business.\n\nSimilar exigencies at the time of the Crimean War stimulated a renewed interest in methods of mechanization and mass-production, which proved longer lasting. A shoemaker in Leicester, Tomas Crick, patented the design for a riveting machine in 1853. His machine used an iron plate to push iron rivets into the sole. The process greatly increased the speed and efficiency of production. He also introduced the use of steam-powered rolling-machines for hardening leather and cutting-machines, in the mid-1850s.\nThe sewing machine was introduced in 1846, and provided an alternative method for the mechanization of shoemaking. By the late 1850s, the industry was beginning to shift towards the modern factory, mainly in the US and areas of England. A shoe stitching machine was invented by the American Lyman Blake in 1856 and perfected by 1864. Entering into partnership with McKay, his device became known as the McKay stitching machine and was quickly adopted by manufacturers throughout New England. As bottlenecks opened up in the production line due to these innovations, more and more of the manufacturing stages, such as pegging and finishing, became automated. By the 1890s, the process of mechanisation was largely complete.\n\nOn January 24, 1899, Humphrey O'Sullivan of Lowell, Massachusetts, was awarded a patent for a rubber heel for boots and shoes.\n\nSince the mid-20th Century, advances in rubber, plastics, synthetic cloth, and industrial adhesives have allowed manufacturers to create shoes that stray considerably from traditional crafting techniques. Leather, which had been the primary material in earlier styles, has remained standard in expensive dress shoes, but athletic shoes often have little or no real leather. Soles, which were once laboriously hand-stitched on, are now more often machine stitched or simply glued on. Many of these newer materials, such as rubber and plastics, have made shoes less biodegradable. It is estimated that most mass-produced shoes require 1000 years to degrade in a landfill. In the late 2000s, some shoemakers picked up on the issue and began to produce shoes made entirely from degradable materials, such as the Nike Considered.\n\nIn 2007, the global shoe industry had an overall market of $107.4 billion, in terms of revenue, and is expected to grow to $122.9 billion by the end of 2012. Shoe manufacturers in the People's Republic of China account for 63% of production, 40.5% of global exports and 55% of industry revenue. However, many manufacturers in Europe dominate the higher-priced, higher value-added end of the market.\n\nAs an integral part of human culture and civilization, shoes have found their way into our culture, folklore, and art. A popular 18th century nursery rhyme is \"There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe\". This story tells about an old woman living in a shoe with a lot of children. In 1948, Mahlon Haines, a shoe salesman in Hallam, Pennsylvania, built an actual house shaped like a work boot as a form of advertisement. The Haines Shoe House was rented to newlyweds and the elderly until his death in 1962. Since then, it has served as an ice cream parlor, a bed and breakfast, and a museum. It still stands today and is a popular roadside attraction.\n\nShoes also play an important role in the fairy tales \"Cinderella\" and \"The Red Shoes\". In the movie adaption of the children's book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot. The 1985 comedy \"The Man with One Red Shoe\" features an eccentric man wearing one normal business shoe and one red shoe that becomes central to the plot.\n\nAthletic sneaker collection has also existed as a part of urban subculture in the United States for several decades. Recent decades have seen this trend spread to European nations such as the Czech Republic. A Sneakerhead is a person who owns multiple pairs of shoes as a form of collection and fashion. A contributor to the growth of sneaker collecting is the continued worldwide popularity of the Air Jordan line of sneakers designed by Nike for Basketball star Michael Jordan.\n\nIn the Bible's Old Testament, the shoe is used to symbolize something that is worthless or of little value. In the New Testament, the act of removing one's shoes symbolizes servitude. Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples regarded the act of removing their shoes as a mark of reverence when approaching a sacred person or place. In the Book of Exodus, Moses was instructed to remove his shoes before approaching the burning bush:\nThe removal of the shoe also symbolizes the act of giving up a legal right. In Hebrew custom, the widow removed the shoe of her late husband's brother to symbolize that he had abandoned his duty. In Arab custom, the removal of one's shoe also symbolized the dissolution of marriage.\n\nIn Arab culture, showing the sole of one's shoe is considered an insult, and to throw a shoe and hit someone with it is considered an even greater insult. Shoes are considered to be dirty as they frequently touch the ground, and are associated with the lowest part of the body — the foot. As such, shoes are forbidden in mosques, and it is also considered unmannerly to cross the legs and display the soles of one's shoes to someone when talking to them. This insult was demonstrated in Iraq, first when Saddam Hussein's statue was toppled in 2003, Iraqis gathered around it and struck the statue with their shoes. Secondly, in 2008, United States President George W. Bush had a shoe thrown at him by a journalist as a statement against the war that was brought to Iraq and the lives that it has cost. More generally, shoe-throwing or shoeing, showing the sole of one's shoe or using shoes to insult are forms of protest in many parts of the world. Incidents where shoes were thrown at political figures have taken place in Australia, India, Ireland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and most notably the Arab world.\n\nEmpty shoes may also symbolize death. In Greek culture, empty shoes are the equivalent of the American funeral wreath. For example, empty shoes placed outside of a Greek home would tell others that the family's son has died in battle. At an observation memorializing the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, 3,000 pairs of empty shoes were used to recognize those killed. The Shoes on the Danube Bank is a memorial in Budapest, Hungary. Conceived by film director Can Togay, he created it on the east bank of the Danube River with sculptor Gyula Pauer to honor the Jews who were killed by fascist Arrow Cross militiamen in Budapest during World War II. They were ordered to take off their shoes, and were shot at the edge of the water so that their bodies fell into the river and were carried away. The memorial represents their shoes left behind on the bank.\n\nThe basic anatomy of a shoe is recognizable, regardless of the specific style of footwear.\nAll shoes have a , which is the bottom of a shoe, in contact with the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, although most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Soles can be simple — a single material in a single layer — or they can be complex, with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers are used, soles may consist of an insole, midsole, and an outsole.\n\nThe is the interior bottom of a shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during the closing of the shoe during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or smell of the shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).\n\nThe is the layer in direct contact with the ground. Dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a synthetic material like polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece, or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called cleated shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction.\n\nThe is the layer in between the outsole and the insole, typically there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down. Some shoes may not have a midsole at all.\n\nThe heel is the bottom rear part of a shoe. Its function is to support the heel of the foot. They are often made of the same material as the sole of the shoe. This part can be high for fashion or to make the person look taller, or flat for a more practical and comfortable use. On some shoes the inner forward point of the heel is chiselled off, a feature known as a \"gentleman's corner\". This piece of design is intended to alleviate the problem of the points catching the bottom of trousers and was first observed in the 1930s. A heel is the projection at the back of a shoe which rests below the heel bone. The shoe heel is used to improve the balance of the shoe, increase the height of the wearer, alter posture or other decorative purposes. Sometimes raised, the high heel is common to a form of shoe often worn by women, but sometimes by men too. See also stiletto heel.\n\nThe helps hold the shoe onto the foot. In the simplest cases, such as sandals or flip-flops, this may be nothing more than a few straps for holding the sole in place. Closed footwear, such as boots, trainers and most men's shoes, will have a more complex upper. This part is often decorated or is made in a certain style to look attractive. The upper is connected to the sole by a strip of leather, rubber, or plastic that is stitched between it and the sole, known as a welt.\n\nMost uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, zippers, elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for tightening the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces usually have a tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks to make it easier to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.\n\nThe is the front part of the shoe, starting behind the toe, extending around the eyelets and tongue and towards back part of the shoe.\n\nThe is the part of the shoe closest to a person's center of symmetry, and the lateral is on the opposite side, away from their center of symmetry. This can be in reference to either the outsole or the vamp. Most shoes have shoelaces on the upper, connecting the medial and lateral parts after one puts their shoes on and aiding in keeping their shoes on their feet. In 1968, Puma SE introduced the first pair of sneakers with Velcro straps in lieu of shoelaces, and these became popular by the 1980s, especially among children and the elderly.\n\nThe is the part that covers and protects the toes. People with toe deformities, or individuals who experience toe swelling (such as long distance runners) usually require a larger toe box.\n\nThere are a wide variety of different types of shoes. Most types of shoes are designed for specific activities. For example, boots are typically designed for work or heavy outdoor use. Athletic shoes are designed for particular sports such as running, walking, or other sports. Some shoes are designed to be worn at more formal occasions, and others are designed for casual wear. There are also a wide variety of shoes designed for different types of dancing. Orthopedic shoes are special types of footwear designed for individuals with particular foot problems or special needs. Other animals, such as dogs and horses, may also wear special shoes to protect their feet as well.\n\nDepending on the activity for which they are designed, some types of footwear may fit into multiple categories. For example, Cowboy boots are considered boots, but may also be worn in more formal occasions and used as dress shoes. Hiking boots incorporate many of the protective features of boots, but also provide the extra flexibility and comfort of many athletic shoes. Flip-flops are considered casual footwear, but have also been worn in formal occasions, such as visits to the White House.\n\nAthletic shoes are specifically designed to be worn for participating in various sports. Since friction between the foot and the ground is an important force in most sports, modern athletic shoes are designed to maximize this force, and materials, such as rubber, are used. Although, for some activities such as dancing or bowling, sliding is desirable, so shoes designed for these activities often have lower coefficients of friction. The earliest athletic shoes date back to the mid 19th century were track spikes — leather shoes with metal cleats on the soles to provide increased friction during running. They were developed by J.W. Foster & Sons, which later become known as Reebok. By the end of the 19th century, Spalding also manufactured these shoes as well. Adidas started selling shoes with track spikes in them for running and soccer in 1925. Spikes were eventually added to shoes for baseball and American football in the 20th century. Golfers also use shoes with small metal spikes on their soles to prevent slipping during their swing.\n\nThe earliest rubber-soled athletic shoes date back to 1876 in the United Kingdom, when the New Liverpool Rubber Company made plimsolls, or sandshoes, designed for the sport of croquet. Similar rubber-soled shoes were made in 1892 in the United States by Humphrey O'Sullivan, based on Charles Goodyear's technology. The United States Rubber Company was founded the same year and produced rubber-soled and heeled shoes under a variety of brand names, which were later consolidated in 1916 under the name, Keds. These shoes became known as, \"sneakers\", because the rubber sole allowed the wearer to sneak up on another person. In 1964, the founding of Nike by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman of the University of Oregon introduced many new improvements common in modern running shoes, such as rubber waffle soles, breathable nylon uppers, and cushioning in the mid-sole and heel. During the 1970s, the expertise of podiatrists also became important in athletic shoe design, to implement new design features based on how feet reacted to specific actions, such as running, jumping, or side-to-side movement. Athletic shoes for women were also designed for their specific physiological differences.\n\nShoes specific to the sport of basketball were developed by Chuck Taylor, and are popularly known as Chuck Taylor All-Stars. These shoes, first sold in 1917, are double-layer canvas shoes with rubber soles and toe caps, and a high heel (known as a \"high top\") for added support. In 1969, Taylor was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in recognition of this development, and in the 1970s, other shoe manufacturers, such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and others began imitating this style of athletic shoe. In April 1985, Nike introduced its own brand of basketball shoe which would become popular in its own right, the Air Jordan, named after the then-rookie Chicago Bulls basketball player, Michael Jordan. The Air Jordan line of shoes sold $100 million in their first year.\n\nAs barefoot running became popular by the late 20th and early 21st century, many modern shoe manufacturers have recently designed footwear that mimic this experience, maintaining optimum flexibility and natural walking while also providing some degree of protection. Termed as Minimalist shoes, their purpose is to allow one's feet and legs to feel more subtly the impacts and forces involved in running, allowing finer adjustments in running style. Some of these shoes include the Vibram FiveFingers, Nike Free, and Saucony's Kinvara and Hattori. Mexican huaraches are also very simple running shoes, similar to the shoes worn by the Tarahumara people of northern Mexico, who are known for their distance running abilities. Wrestling shoes are also very light and flexible shoes that are designed to mimic bare feet while providing additional traction and protection.\n\nMany athletic shoes are designed with specific features for specific activities. One of these includes roller skates, which have metal or plastic wheels on the bottom specific for the sport of roller skating. Similarly, ice skates have a metal blade attached to the bottom for locomotion across ice. Skate shoes have also been designed to provide a comfortable, flexible and durable shoe for the sport of skateboarding. Climbing shoes are rubber-soled, tight-fitting shoes designed to fit in the small cracks and crevices for rock climbing. Cycling shoes are similarly designed with rubber soles and a tight fit, but also are equipped with a metal or plastic cleat to interface with clipless pedals, as well as a stiff sole to maximize power transfer and support the foot.\n\nA boot is a special type of shoe which covers the foot and the ankle and extends up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. They are typically made of leather or rubber, although they may be made from a variety of different materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality — protecting the foot and leg from water, snow, mud or hazards or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities — as well as for reasons of style and fashion.\n\nCowboy boots are a specific style of riding boot which combines function with fashion. They became popular among cowboys in the western United States during the 19th century. Traditional cowboy boots have a Cuban heel, rounded to pointed toe, high shaft, and, traditionally, no lacing. They are normally made from cowhide leather but may be made from more exotic skins such as ostrich, anaconda, or elephant skins.\n\nHiking boots are designed to provide extra ankle and arch support, as well as extra padding for comfort during hiking. They are constructed to provide comfort for miles of walking over rough terrains, and protect the hiker's feet against water, mud, rocks, and other wilderness obstacles. These boots support the ankle to avoid twisting but do not restrict the ankle's movement too much. They are fairly stiff to support the foot. A properly fitted boot and/or friction-reducing patches applied to troublesome areas ensures protection against blisters and other discomforts associated with long hikes on rugged terrain.\n\nDuring wet or snowy weather, snow boots are worn to keep the foot warm and dry. They are typically made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and designed to provide a way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.\n\nBoots are designed to withstand heavy wear to protect the wearer and provide good traction. They are generally made from sturdy leather uppers and non-leather outsoles. They may be used for uniforms of the police or military, as well as for protection in industrial settings such as mining and construction. Protective features may include steel-tipped toes and soles or ankle guards.\n\nDress shoes are characterized by smooth and supple leather uppers, leather soles, and narrow sleek figure. Casual shoes are characterized by sturdy leather uppers, non-leather outsoles, and wide profile.\n\nSome designs of dress shoes can be worn by either gender. The majority of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This upper part of the shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or zippers, although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on.\n\nMen's shoes can be categorized by how they are closed:\n\nMen's shoes can also be decorated in various ways:\n\nFormal high-end men's shoes are manufactured by several companies around the world, most notably in England, France, Italy, and America. Notable British brands include: Church's English Shoes (est. 1873), John Lobb Bootmaker (est. 1849), Edward Green Shoes (est. 1890), and Crockett & Jones (est. 1879). Both John Lobb and Edward Green offer bespoke products. In between the world wars, men's footwear received significant innovation and design, led by cobblers and cordwainers in London's West End. The most notable French product is made by J.M. Weston. Armani of Italy was a major influence on men's shoe design in the 1960s–1980s until they returned to the larger proportions of its forebears, the welt-constructed Anglo-American dress shoe originally created in Edwardian England. Another well-known Italian company is Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.. The remaining elite American companies are Allen Edmonds and Alden Shoe Company. Alden, located in New England, specializes in genuine shell cordovan leather from the only remaining horse tannery in America (Chicago) and is completely manufactured in America, whereas Allen Edmonds, of Wisconsin, is a larger company that outsources some of its production.\n\nThere is a large variety of shoes available for women, in addition to most of the men's styles being more accepted as unisex. Some broad categories are:\n\n\nA wide variety of footwear is used by dancers. The choice of dance shoe type depends on the style of dance that is to be performed and, in many cases, the characteristics of the surface that will be danced on.\n\nOrthopedic shoes are specially-designed footwear to relieve discomfort associated with many foot and ankle disorders, such as blisters, bunions, calluses and corns, hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, or heel spurs. They may also be worn by individuals with diabetes or people with unequal leg length. These shoes typically have a low heel, tend to be wide with a particularly wide toe box, and have a firm heel to provide extra support. Some may also have a removable insole, or orthotic, to provide extra arch support.\nThe measure of a foot for a shoe is from the heel to the longest toe. Shoe size is an alphanumerical indication of the fitting size of a shoe for a person. Often it just consists of a number indicating the length because many shoemakers only provide a standard width for economic reasons. There are several different shoe-size systems that are used worldwide. These systems differ in what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Only a few systems also take the width of the feet into account. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g., men's, women's, children's, sport, or safety shoes).\n\nUnits for shoe sizes vary widely around the world. European sizes are measured in \"Paris Points\", which are worth two-thirds of a centimeter. The UK and American units are approximately one-quarter of an inch, starting at 8¼ inches. Men's and women's shoe sizes often have different scales. Shoes size is often measured using a Brannock Device, which can determine both the width and length size values of the foot.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28271", "title": "Sushi", "text": "Sushi\n\nSushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (\"gari\"), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (\"takuan\") are popular garnishes for the dish.\n\n\"Sushi\" is sometimes confused with \"sashimi\", a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.\n\nSushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as \"narezushi\" ( – \"salted fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term \"sushi\" comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means \"sour-tasting\"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as \"funa-zushi\" from Shiga Prefecture.\n\nVinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became \"oshi-zushi\" or \"hako-zushi\"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.\n\nIt was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's \"nigirizushi\" became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of \"nigirizushi\"'s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed \"Edomae zushi\" as it used freshly caught fish from the \"Edo-mae\" (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term \"Edomae nigirizushi\" is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.\n\nThe earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the \"Oxford English Dictionary is\" in an 1893 book, \"A Japanese Interior\", where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\". There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal \"Notes and Queries\".\n\nThe common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared \"sushi rice\". Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.\n\nNote that due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with \"zu\" instead of \"su\" whenever a prefix is attached, such as in nigirizushi for instance.\n\n\"Chirashizushi\" (, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as \"barazushi\") serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.\n\nInarizushi () is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.\n\nTales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god \"Inari\". Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.\n\nRegional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (, \"fukusa-zushi\", or , \"chakin-zushi\") instead of tofu. It should not be confused with \"inari maki\", which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.\n\nCone sushi is a variant of \"inarizushi\" originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage piece. It is often sold in \"okazu-ya\" (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.\n\nMakizushi (, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (, \"Nori roll\") or makimono (, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a \"makisu\" (). \"Makizushi\" is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. \"Makizushi\" is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of \"makizushi\", but many other kinds exist.\nFutomaki (, \"thick, large or fat rolls\") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"futomaki\" is in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called \"ehō-maki\" (, lit. happy direction rolls). By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, \"kampyō\" gourd, \"takenoko\" bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of \"tamagoyaki\" omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and \"oboro (food)\" whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Traditionally, the rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil/perilla oil. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, or seasoned beef rib-eye. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, spinach, carrot and (pickled radish). After the makizushi has been rolled and sliced, it is typically served with takuan.\n\nShort grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice.\nNowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc.Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating.\nTamago makizushi (玉子巻き寿司) is makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg. Tempura Makizushi (天ぷら 巻き寿司) or Agezushi (揚げ寿司ロール) is a fried version of the dish.\n\nHosomaki (, \"thin rolls\") is a small cylindrical piece, with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"hosomaki\" has a diameter of about . They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, \"kanpyō\", thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. \"Kappamaki\", () a kind of \"Hosomaki\" filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, \"kappamaki\" is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. \"Tekkamaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word \"tekka\", meaning \"red hot iron\", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called \"tekkaba\" (), much like the sandwich. \"Negitoromaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with scallion (\"negi\") and chopped tuna (\"toro\"). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. \"Tsunamayomaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.\n\nTemaki (, \"hand roll\") is a large cone-shaped piece of \"nori\" on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical \"temaki\" is about long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, \"temaki\" must be eaten quickly after being made because the \"nori\" cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the \"nori\" in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.\n\n\"Narezushi\" (, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this \"sushi\" can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more.\n\nThe most famous variety of \"narezushi\" are the ones offered as a specialty dish of Shiga Prefecture, particularly the \"funa-zushi\" made from fish of the crucian carp genus, the authentic version of which calls for the use \"nigorobuna\", a particular locally differentiated variety of wild goldfish endemic to Lake Biwa).\n\n\"Nigirizushi\" (, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of \"sushi rice\" that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the \"neta\") draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of \"wasabi\"; \"neta\" are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of \"nori\", most commonly octopus (\"tako\"), freshwater eel (\"unagi\"), sea eel (\"anago\"), squid (\"ika\"), and sweet egg (\"tamago\"). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.\n\n\"Gunkanmaki\" (, \"warship roll\") is a special type of \"nigirizushi\": an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of \"nori\" wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of \"nori\" such as roe, \"nattō\", oysters, \"uni\" (sea urchin roe), corn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. \"Gunkan-maki\" was invented at the \"Ginza Kyubey\" restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.\n\n\"Temarizushi\" (, \"ball sushi\") is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.\n\n, also known as , is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an \"oshibako\". The chef lines the bottom of the \"oshibako\" with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is (\"battera\", pressed mackerel sushi) or (\"saba zushi\"). In \"oshizushi\", all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used.\n\nThe increasing popularity of \"sushi\" around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry in the 1980s.. Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a \"norimaki\" with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (\"norimaki\" and \"uramaki\") has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of \"uramakizushi\" filled with \"tamago\" (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with \"shiso\" leaf and \"nori\", topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.\n\nUramaki (, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings, and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. \"Uramaki\" differs from other \"makimono\" because the rice is on the outside and the \"nori\" inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by \"nori\", then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\n\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced \"maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake\" and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\n\nIn Japan, \"uramaki\" is an uncommon type of \"makimono\"; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.\n\n\"Futomaki\" is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the tempura roll, where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.\n\nPer Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites. Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan, raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent a component in American-style sushi.\n\nSince rolls are often made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g. salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include:\n\nAll sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.\n\n\"Sushi-meshi\" (also known as \"Su-meshi\" , \"shari\" , or \"gohan\" ) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and \"sake\". It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a \"sushi\" or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (\"shinmai\") typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\nThe black seaweed wrappers used in \"makimono\" are called \"nori\" (海苔). \"Nori\" is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a \"nori\" sheet influences the size of \"makimono\". A full-size sheet produces \"futomaki\", and a half produces \"hosomaki\" and \"temaki\". To produce \"gunkan\" and some other \"makimono\", an appropriately-sized piece of \"nori\" is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n\"Nori\" by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making \"fukusazushi\", a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of \"nori\" as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.\n\nFor culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (\"maguro, shiro-maguro\"), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (\"hamachi\"), snapper (\"kurodai\"), mackerel (\"saba\"), and salmon (\"sake\"). The most valued sushi ingredient is \"toro,\" the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of \"ōtoro\" (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and \"chūtoro\", meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between \"toro\" and the regular cut. \"Aburi\" style refers to \"nigiri\" sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw \"neta\".\n\nOther seafoods such as squid (\"ika\"), eel (\"anago\" and \"unagi\"), pike conger (\"hamo\"), octopus (\"tako\"), shrimp (\"ebi\" and \"amaebi\"), clam (\"mirugai\", \"aoyagi\" and \"akagai\"), fish roe (\"ikura\", \"masago\", \"kazunoko\" and \"tobiko\"), sea urchin (\"uni\"), crab (\"kani\"), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. \"Kani kama\", or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.\n\nPickled daikon radish (\"takuan\") in \"shinko maki\", pickled vegetables (\"tsukemono\"), fermented soybeans (\"nattō\") in \"nattō maki\", avocado, cucumber in \"kappa maki\", asparagus, yam, pickled ume (\"umeboshi\"), gourd (\"kanpyō\"), burdock (\"gobo\"), and sweet corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi.\n\nTofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called \"tamagoyaki\" and raw quail eggs ride as a \"gunkan-maki\" topping) are common.\n\nSushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the \"Wasabia japonica\" plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.\n\nTrue wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or \"samegawa oroshi\". An imitation wasabi (\"seiyo-wasabi\"), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end \"kaiten-zushi\" restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\".\n\nGari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (\"ocha\") is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as \"mecha\". In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as \"agari\".\n\nSushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called \"baran\" or \"kiri-zasa\" (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the \"Aspidistra elatior\" (葉蘭 \"haran\") and \"Sasa veitchii\" (熊笹 \"kuma-zasa\") plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.\n\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are \"gari\" and \"nori\". Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function.\n\nGenerally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content. Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from \"shoyu\" soy sauce seasoning.\n\nSome of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.\n\nAccording to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish. This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover, are also a concern as well.\n\nSashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nFor the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours. As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users \"super-freeze\" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C. As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.\n\nSome forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass.\n\nSustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental, economic and social stability and human health.\n\nTraditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.\n\nMany sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \"shō-chiku-bai\" (), \"shō/matsu\" (, pine), \"chiku/take\" (, bamboo) and (\"bai/ume\"), with \"matsu\" the most expensive and \" ume\" the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.\n\nSushi may be served \"kaiten zushi\" (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer \"kaiten zushi\" restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.\n\nSome specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars.\n\n\nUnlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, \"nigirizushi\" is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a \"bento\", a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart. If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using \"gari\" (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use. However, today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.\n\n"}

Each sutra is any short rule, like a theorem distilled into few words or syllables, around which teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar, or any field of knowledge can be woven. The oldest sutras of Hinduism are found in the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas. Every school of Hindu philosophy, Vedic guides for rites of passage, various fields of arts, law, and social ethics developed respective sutras, which helped teach and transmit ideas from one generation to the next.\n\nIn Buddhism, sutras, also known as \"suttas\", are canonical scriptures, many of which are regarded as records of the oral teachings of Gautama Buddha. They are not aphoristic, but are quite detailed, sometimes with repetition. This may reflect a philological root of \"sukta\" (well spoken), rather than \"sutra\" (thread).\n\nIn Jainism, sutras also known as \"suyas\" are canonical sermons of Mahavira contained in the Jain Agamas as well as some later (post-canonical) normative texts.\n\nThe Sanskrit word \"Sūtra\" (Sanskrit: सूत्र, Pali: \"sūtta\", Ardha Magadhi: \"sūya\") means \"string, thread\". The root of the word is \"siv\", that which sews and holds things together. The word is related to \"sūci\" (Sanskrit: सूचि) meaning \"needle, list\", and \"sūnā\" (Sanskrit: सूना) meaning \"woven\".\n\nIn the context of literature, \"sūtra\" means a distilled collection of syllables and words, any form or manual of \"aphorism, rule, direction\" hanging together like threads with which the teachings of ritual, philosophy, grammar, or any field of knowledge can be woven.\n\nA \"sūtra\" is any short rule, states Moriz Winternitz, in Indian literature; it is \"a theorem condensed in few words\". A collection of \"sūtras\" becomes a text, and this is also called \"sūtra\" (often capitalized in Western literature).\n\nA \"sūtra\" is different from other components such as \"Shlokas\", \"Anuvyakhayas\" and \"Vyakhyas\" found in ancient Indian literature. A \"sūtra\" is a condensed rule which succinctly states the message, while a \"Shloka\" is a verse that conveys the complete message and is structured to certain rules of musical meter, a \"Anuvyakhaya\" is an explanation of the reviewed text, while a \"Vyakhya\" is a comment by the reviewer.\n\nSutras first appear in the Brahmana and Aranyaka layer of Vedic literature. They grow in the Vedangas, such as the Shrauta Sutras and Kalpa Sutras. These were designed so that they can be easily communicated from a teacher to student, memorized by the recipient for discussion or self-study or as reference.\n\nA sutra by itself is condensed shorthand, and the threads of syllable are difficult to decipher or understand, without associated scholarly Bhasya or deciphering commentary that fills in the \"woof\".\n\nThe oldest manuscripts that have survived into the modern era, that contain extensive sutras, are part of the Vedas dated to be from the late 2nd millennium BCE through mid 1st-millennium BCE. The Aitareya Aranyaka for example, states Winternitz, is primarily a collection of \"sutras\". Their use and ancient roots are attested by sutras being mentioned in larger genre of ancient non-Vedic Hindu literature called \"Gatha\", \"Narashansi\", \"Itihasa\", and \"Akhyana\" (songs, legends, epics, and stories).\n\nIn the history of Indian literature, large compilations of sutras, in diverse fields of knowledge, have been traced to the period from 600 BCE to 200 BCE (mostly after Buddha and Mahavira), and this has been called the \"sutras period\". This period followed the more ancient \"Chhandas period\", \"Mantra period\" and \"Brahmana period\".\n\nSome of the earliest surviving specimen of \"sutras\" of Hinduism are found in the \"Anupada Sutras\" and \"Nidana Sutras\". The former distills the epistemic debate whether Sruti or Smriti or neither must be considered the more reliable source of knowledge, while the latter distills the rules of musical meters for Samaveda chants and songs.\n\nA larger collection of ancient sutra literature in Hinduism corresponds to the six Vedangas, or six limbs of the Vedas. These are six subjects that were called in the Vedas as necessary for complete mastery of the Vedas. The six subjects with their own \"sutras\" were \"pronunciation (Shiksha), meter (Chandas), grammar (Vyakarana), explanation of words (Nirukta), time keeping through astronomy (Jyotisha), and ceremonial rituals (Kalpa). The first two, states Max Muller, were considered in the Vedic era to be necessary for reading the Veda, the second two for understanding it, and the last two for deploying the Vedic knowledge at yajnas (fire rituals). The \"sutras\" corresponding to these are embedded inside the Brahmana and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas. Taittiriya Aranyaka, for example in Book 7, embeds sutras for accurate pronunciation after the terse phrases \"On Letters\", \"On Accents\", \"On Quantity\", \"On Delivery\", and \"On Euphonic Laws\".\n\nThe fourth and often the last layer of philosophical, speculative text in the Vedas, the Upanishads, too have embedded sutras such as those found in the Taittiriya Upanishad.\n\nThe compendium of ancient Vedic sutra literature that has survived, in full or fragments, includes the Kalpa Sutras, Smarta Sutras, Srauta Sutras, Dharma Sutras, Grhya Sutras, and Sulba Sutras. Other fields for which ancient sutras are known include etymology, phonetics, and grammar.\n\nSome examples of sutra texts in various schools of Hindu philosophy include:\n\n\n\nIn Buddhism, a \"sutta\" or \"sutra\" is a part of the canonical literature. These early Buddhist sutras, unlike Hindu texts, are not aphoristic. On the contrary, they are most often quite lengthy. According to Norman, the Buddhist term \"sutta\" or \"sutra\" probably has roots in Sanskrit \"sūkta\" (\"su\" + \"ukta\"), \"well spoken\" from the belief that \"all that was spoken by the Lord Buddha was well-spoken\". They share the character of sermons of \"well spoken\" wisdom with the Jaina sutras.\n\nIn Chinese, these are known as 經 (pinyin: \"jīng\"). These teachings are assembled in part of the Tripiṭaka which is called the \"Sutta Pitaka\". There are many important or influential Mahayana texts, such as the \"Platform Sutra\" and the \"Lotus Sutra\", that are called sutras despite being attributed to much later authors.\n\nIn the Jain tradition, sutras are an important genre of \"fixed text\", which used to be memorized.\n\nThe Kalpa Sūtra is, for example, a Jain text that includes monastic rules, as well as the mythical biographies of the Jain Tirthankaras. Many sutras discuss all aspects of ascetic and lay life in Jainism. Various ancient sutras particularly from the early 1st millennium CE, for example, states M. Whitney Kelting, recommend \"bhakti as devotionalism is a central part of a Jain practice\".\n\nThe surviving scriptures of Jaina tradition, such as the Acaranga Sutra (Agamas) exist in sutra format, as is the Tattvartha Sutra – a Sanskrit text accepted by all four Jainism sects as the most authoritative philosophical text that completely summarizes the foundations of Jainism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28367", "title": "Spam (food)", "text": "Spam (food)\n\nSpam (stylized as SPAM) is a brand of canned cooked pig meat made by Hormel Foods Corporation, based out of Minnesota. It was first introduced in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II. By 2003, Spam was sold in 41 countries on six continents and trademarked in over 100 countries (not including the Middle East and North Africa). Spam's basic ingredients are pork with ham meat added, salt, water, modified potato starch (as a binder), sugar, and sodium nitrite (as a preservative). Natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its tins on the production line. Many have raised concerns over Spam's nutritional attributes, in large part due to its high content of fat, sodium, and preservatives.\n\nBy the early 1970s the name \"spam\" had become a genericized trademark used to describe any canned meat product containing pork, such as pork luncheon meat. With an expansion in communications technology, it became the subject of urban legends about mystery meat and made other appearances in pop culture. The most notable was a Monty Python sketch which led to its name being borrowed for unsolicited electronic messages, especially email.\n\nSpam was introduced by Hormel on July 5, 1937. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America states that the product was intended to increase the sale of pork shoulder which was not a very popular cut. Ken Daigneau, brother of a company executive, won a $100 prize that year in a competition to name the new item. Hormel claims that the meaning of the name \"is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Foods executives\", but popular beliefs are that the name is an abbreviation of \"spiced ham\".\nThe difficulty of delivering fresh meat to the front during World War II saw Spam become a ubiquitous part of the U.S. soldier's diet. It became variously referred to as \"ham that didn't pass its physical\", \"meatloaf without basic training\", and \"Special Army Meat\". Over 150 million pounds of Spam were purchased by the military before the war's end.\n\nDuring World War II and the occupations which followed, Spam was introduced into Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific. Immediately absorbed into native diets, it has become a unique part of the history and effects of U.S. influence in the Pacific.\n\nAs a consequence of World War II rationing and the Lend-Lease Act, Spam also gained prominence in the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher later referred to it as a \"wartime delicacy\". In addition to increasing production for the U.K., Hormel expanded Spam output as part of Allied aid to the similarly beleaguered Soviet Union. Nikita Khrushchev declared: \"Without Spam we wouldn't have been able to feed our army\". Throughout the war, countries ravaged by the conflict and faced with strict food rations came to appreciate Spam.\n\nThe billionth can was sold in 1959, and in 2007, the seven billionth can of Spam was sold.In 2012, the eight billionth can of Spam was sold.\n\nDomestically, Spam's chief advantages were affordability, accessibility, and extended shelf life. At the time it was introduced, it was the only canned meat product on the market that needed no refrigeration. Statistics from the 1990s say that 3.8 cans of Spam are consumed every second in the United States, totaling nearly 122 million cans annually. It became part of the diet of almost 30% of American households, perceived differently in various regions of the country. It is also sometimes associated with economic hardship because of its relatively low cost.\n\nSpam that is sold in North America, South America, and Australia is produced in Austin, Minnesota (also known as \"Spam Town USA\") and in Fremont, Nebraska. Austin, Minnesota also has a restaurant with a menu devoted exclusively to Spam, called \"Johnny's SPAMarama Menu\".\n\nIn 1963, Spam was introduced to various private and public schools in South Florida as cheap food and even for art sculptures. Due to the success of the introduction, Hormel Foods also introduced school \"color-themed\" spam, the first being a blue and green variety which is still traditionally used in some private schools of South Florida.\n\nSpam is especially popular in the state of Hawaii, where residents have the highest per capita consumption in the United States. Its perception there is very different from on the mainland. Hawaiians sometimes call it \"Portagee Steak\".\n\nA popular local dish in Hawaii is Spam musubi, where cooked Spam is placed atop rice and wrapped in a band of nori, a form of \"onigiri\".\nVarieties of Spam are found in Hawaii that are unavailable in other markets, including Honey Spam, Spam with Bacon, and Hot and Spicy Spam.\n\nHawaiian Burger King restaurants began serving Spam in 2007 to compete with the local McDonald's chains. In Hawaii, Spam is so popular that it is sometimes referred to as \"The Hawaiian Steak\". There is even an annual Spam-themed festival on the island of Oahu that takes place every spring, known as the \"Waikiki Spam Jam. Local chefs and restaurants compete to create new Spam-themed dishes, which are then sold in a massive street fair on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki.\n\nIn 2017, Hawaii was plagued by a rash of thefts of Spam. Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the magnitude of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved. This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.\n\nIn Guam, average per capita consumption is 16 tins (cans) per year. It is also found on McDonald's menus there. The \"Spam Games\" also takes place in Guam, where locals sample and honor the best original, homemade Spam recipes.\n\nIn the Northern Mariana Islands, lawyers from Hormel have threatened to sue the local press for publishing articles alleging ill-effects of high Spam consumption on the health of the local population.\n\nSandwich de Mezcla is a party staple in Puerto Rico containing Spam, Velveeta, and pimientos between two slices of sandwich bread.\n\nAfter World War II, Newforge Foods, part of the Fitch Lovell group, was awarded the license to produce the product in the UK at its Gateacre factory, Liverpool, where it stayed until production switched to the Danish Crown Group (owners of the Tulip Food Company) in 1998.\n\nThe United Kingdom has adopted Spam into various recipes. For example, recipes include Spam Yorkshire Breakfast, Spamish Omelette, and Spam Hash. Spam can also be sliced, battered and deep-fried into Spam fritters.\n\nIn the Philippines, Spam is a popular food item and seen as a cultural symbol. As a former US territory, Spam reached the islands similar to how it reached Hawaii and Guam: as a result of World War 2 rationing. Spam is commonly eaten with rice (usually garlic fried rice) and a sunny-side up egg for breakfast. It is prepared and used in a variety of ways, including being fried, served alongside condiments, or used in sandwiches. It has also been featured in numerous Filipino fusion cuisine dishes including Spam burgers, Spam spaghetti, Spam nuggets, and others.\n\nThe popularity of Spam in the Philippines transcends economic class, and Spam gift sets are even used as homecoming gifts. There are at least ten different varieties of Spam currently available in the country and an estimated 1.25 million kilos of the meat is sold every year in the Philippines. During the rescue efforts after Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in 2009, Hormel Foods donated over 30,000 pounds of Spam to the Philippine National Red Cross.\n\nIn China, Hormel decided to adopt a different strategy to market Spam, promoting it as a foreign, premium food product and changing the Spam formula to be meatier in order to accommodate local Chinese tastes.\nIn Okinawa, Japan, the product is added into onigiri alongside eggs and used as a staple ingredient in the traditional Okinawan dish \"chanpurū\", and a Spam burger is sold by local fast food chain Jef. For the 70th anniversary of Spam in 2007, cans with special designs were sold in Japan due to its popularity, primarily in Okinawa.\nFollowing the March 2011 earthquake, Spam sales in Japan declined and Hormel shifted its focus to China although Hormel did pledge to donate $100,000 along with cans of Spam for relief efforts.\nIn the summer of 2011, Burger King introduced its own version of a burger made of Spam, called 'BK Shot' Spam Burgers. These small burgers are filled with slices of the canned meat and were an attempt by Burger King to capitalize on Spam's popularity in Japan. In early 2014, Burger King also introduced the Spam and Cheese burger as a breakfast menu item.\nIn Hong Kong after World War II, meat was scarce and expensive, so Spam was an accessible, affordable alternative. The luncheon meat has been incorporated into dishes such as macaroni with fried egg and spam in chicken soup, as well as ramen.\nIn later years, the surfeit of Spam in both North and South Korea during the Korean War led to the establishment of the Spam \"kimbap\" (rice and vegetable filled seaweed roll). Because of a scarcity of fish and other traditional kimbap products such as kimchi or fermented cabbage, Spam was added to a rice roll with kimchi and cucumber and wrapped in seaweed. Spam was also used by US soldiers in Korea as a means of trading for items, services or information around their bases.\n\nIn South Korea, Spam (, licensed from Hormel by CJ CheilJedang) is popular with a majority of the population, and outranks Coca-Cola and KFC in status as a foodstuff. Today, South Korea produces and consumes more Spam than any other country except the United States.\n\nSpam is also an original ingredient in \"budae jjigae\" (\"army base stew\"), a spicy stew with different types of preserved meat.\n\nIn Mandatory Palestine, demand for kosher canned meats increased as Spam became more popular during World War II. Canned meat was briefly mentioned during wartime from 1939–43, but the true boom in kosher canned meat came in 1945. This is when kosher canned meat became the key item in Europe's Jewish war victim relief packages. Then in 1946, the Chicago Kosher Sausage Manufacturing Company registered a patent for a kosher canned meat product called Breef. Made of beef, Breef has a similar texture to Spam but tastes like corned beef. Also, a kosher variant of Spam, known as Loof (, a Hebrew linguistic play on meatloaf), was produced by Richard Levi, and mostly used as part of field rations by the Israel Defense Forces. A Glatt kosher version was also produced. It was phased out of field rations during the early 2000s and was finally removed from rations when production ceased in 2009.\n\nBeginning in 1940, Spam sponsored George Burns and Gracie Allen on their radio program.\n\nDuring WWII, Spam was not only eaten but was also incorporated into many other aspects of the war (grease for guns, cans for scrap metal, etc.); it was so prominent that Uncle Sam was nicknamed \"Uncle Spam\". Other terms influenced by the product’s name include the European invasion fleet, or the \"Spam Fleet\". Furthermore, the United Service Organizations (USO) toured the \"Spam Circuit\".\n\nIn the United States in the aftermath of World War II, a troupe of former servicewomen was assembled by Hormel Foods to promote Spam from coast to coast. The group was known as the Hormel Girls and associated the food with being patriotic. In 1948, two years after its formation, the troupe had grown to 60 women with 16 forming an orchestra. The show went on to become a radio program where the main selling point was Spam. The Hormel Girls were disbanded in 1953.\n\nSpam has long had a somewhat dubious reputation in the United States and (to a lesser degree) United Kingdom as a poverty food. The image of Spam as a low cost meat product gave rise to the Scottish colloquial term \"Spam valley\" to describe certain affluent housing areas where residents appear to be wealthy but in reality may be living at poverty levels.\n\nSpam was featured in an iconic 1970 Monty Python sketch called \"Spam\". Set in a café which mostly served dishes containing Spam, including \"egg and Spam, egg bacon and Spam, Spam egg sausage and Spam, Spam egg Spam Spam bacon and Spam \", the piece also featured a companion song. By the 1990s, Spam's perceived ubiquity led to its name being adopted for unsolicited electronic messages, especially spam email. Because of its use in a line of a song in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", the title of the musical version of the film became \"Spamalot\".\n\nSpam is the subject of the \"Weird Al\" Yankovic song \"Spam\", which is a parody of the R.E.M. song \"Stand\".\n\nOther offshoots of Spam in popular culture include a book of haikus about Spam titled \"Spam-Ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf\". There is also a mock Church of Spam, and a Spam Cam which is a webcam trained on a can of decaying Spam.\n\nIn the 1982 film \"Sophie's Choice\", the character Stingo brings a carton of Spam to his newly-rented room.\n\nSpam is referenced in \"Island of the Sequined Love Nun\" by Christopher Moore, where SPAM is explained as \"Shaped Pork Approximating Man\", which was used to explain its popularity amongst Pacific Island Cannibals.\n\nSpam has also been mentioned in the online point and click game \"Escape from Plastic Beach\" from 2010 on gorillaz.com. In the game it's used as bait for a talking fish.\n\nSpam is celebrated in Austin, Minnesota, home to the Spam Museum. The museum tells the history of the Hormel company, the origin of Spam, and its place in world culture, including Hawaii where Spam is eaten daily by locals.\n\nAustin is also the location of final judging in the national Spam recipe competition. Competing recipes are collected from winning submissions at the top 40 state fairs in the nation. The Spamettes are a quartet from Austin who only sing about Spam in parodies of popular songs. They first performed at the first Spam Jam in 1990 and continue to perform at various events.\n\nHawaii holds an annual Spam Jam in Waikiki during the last week of April. The small town of Shady Cove, Oregon is home to the annual Spam Parade and Festival, with the city allocating US$1,500 for it.\n\nSpamarama was a yearly festival held around April Fool's Day in Austin, Texas. The theme of Spamarama was a gentle parody of Spam, rather than a straightforward celebration: the event at the heart of the festival was a Spam cook-off that originated as a challenge to produce the most appetizing recipe for the meat. A rule of the event was that contestants had to be prepared to eat the Spam dish if requested by a judge. The festival included light sporting activities and musical acts, in addition to the cook-off.\nThe ingredients of Spam vary according to variety and market; those of variety \"Spam Classic\" are: pork, ham, salt, water, potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite.\n\nAs listed on the official Spam website, there are numerous different flavors of Spam products, including:\n\n"}
{"id": "28486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28486", "title": "Stella Artois", "text": "Stella Artois\n\nStella Artois ( ) is a Belgian pilsner of between 4.8 and 5.2% ABV which was first brewed by \"Brouwerij Artois\" (the Artois Brewery) in Leuven, Belgium, in 1926. Since 2008, a 4% ABV version has also been sold in Britain, Ireland and Canada. Stella Artois is now owned by Interbrew International B.V. which is a subsidiary of the world's largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.\n\nIn 1708, Sébastien Artois became head brewer at the Den Hoorn brewery in Leuven, a brewery established in 1366. Artois purchased the brewery in 1717 and renamed it \"Brouwerij Artois\".\n\nIn 1926, \"Brouwerij Artois\" launched Stella as a Christmas beer, named after the Christmas star. First sold in the winter season, it eventually became available year-round, with exports into the broad European market commencing in 1930. Production was halted for a period when \"Brouwerij Artois\" suspended operations during World War II. By 1960, about 100 million litres of Stella Artois were being produced annually. Whitbread began to brew it under contract in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1976.\n\nIn 1988, \"Brouwerij Artois\" was a founding member in the merger creating Interbrew. That year, Taylorbrands founder David Taylor created the current package design, bottle design, and shape. The original 1926 bottle label inspired the design, which replaced a 1960s design. The design incorporates the horn symbol and the 1366 date of the original Den Hoorn brewery. The label also shows medals for excellence awarded to \"Brouwerij Artois\" at a number of trade exhibitions in Belgium in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Stella Artois is held within a cartouche which was influenced by the style of Belgian architecture in Leuven.\n\nIn 1993, Interbrew moved production of Stella Artois into a new, fully automated brewery in Leuven. In 2004, Interbrew was part of the merger creating InBev, and by 2006, total annual production volume of Stella Artois exceeded one billion litres.\n\nIn 2008, InBev was part of the merger creating the Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) brewery company. That same year, a lower-alcohol version, Stella Artois 4%, was introduced in the UK market. In 2011, a cider, Stella Artois Cidre, was launched.\n\nIn 2012, AB InBev reduced the alcohol content of their beers for the UK market, from 5% to 4.8%. The original UK strength of Stella Artois was 5.2%. According to Prof Freddy Delvaux, former head of the in-house laboratory, the Belgian version was 33 IBU when he joined the lab in 1973, compared to just 20 IBU in 2014.\n\nStella Artois is brewed in Belgium (in the plants at Leuven and Jupille) and the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries, including Australia, Brazil and Ukraine. Much of the beer exported from Europe is produced at InBev's brewery in Belgium, and packaged in the Beck's Brewery in Bremen, Germany. Stella Artois is also brewed for the Australian market by Lion. In the United States, Stella Artois is imported and distributed by Anheuser-Busch. For the Hungarian market, Stella Artois is also brewed in Bőcs, Hungary, by Borsod Brewery, under licence from InBev.\n\nStella Artois is available on draught and in several packaged sizes: 250 ml bottle, 275 ml bottle, 284 ml bottle, 330 ml bottle, 330 ml can, 440 ml can, 500 ml can, 660 ml bottle, 700 ml bottle, 985 ml bottle, 1 litre bottle, and pint-sized can known as \"La Grande Bière\" (568 ml).\nInitially, brewers Whitbread launched Stella in the UK with a campaign by its then advertising agency Allen, Brady and Marsh. The theme was \"strength\". With copy by Rod Allen and art direction by Bob Stannard and Creative director Peter Monkcom, the ads featured the slogan \"Stella's for the fellas who take their lager strong\". The images showed only a Stella-monogrammed half-pint glass (due to its strength) – in one advertisement with a muscular 'glass arm' for a handle, in the other a glass sitting beside a torn-in-half telephone directory. This was the same creative unit which was involved, at the time, in Whitbread's launch of Trophy Bitter \"The pint that thinks it's a quart\".\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Stella Artois advertising slogan in the United Kingdom was \"Reassuringly Expensive\". The UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotiv inspired by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La forza del destino\". The campaigns began with a series of advertisements based on the 1986 French film \"Jean de Florette\", directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres, including war films, silent comedy and even surrealism. They have used notable film directors such as Jonathan Glazer. Furthermore, the brand makes extensive use of the French language in its advertising campaigns, even though the beer brand originates from the monolingual Dutch-speaking city of Leuven. An example of this can be seen in the advertising campaign for Stella Artois Cidre, in which the tag-line \"C'est cidre, not cider\" is used, although this cider is produced in Zonhoven, which also lies in the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region.\n\nStella Artois is advertised as containing \"only 4 ingredients: hops, malted barley, maize and water\". Yeast is also an ingredient used in the fermentation process, but almost all of it is removed before packaging. Since 2009, Stella Artois has been suitable for vegetarians, as isinglass (fish bladder) is no longer used to remove trace amounts of yeast.\n\nStella Artois has been nicknamed \"wife beater\" in the United Kingdom, due to a perceived connection with aggression and binge drinking. AB InBev lobbyists, Portland Communications, were exposed as trying to remove all \"wife beater\" references from the Wikipedia article about the product.\n\nAn advertisement for Stella Artois featuring actor Adrien Brody aired during Super Bowl XLV in February 2011. Although Anheuser-Busch InBev is a regular advertiser during the Super Bowl, this was the first time Stella Artois had been featured in a Super Bowl advertisement. The commercial was heavily criticised in Flemish media for giving the impression that the beer is French.\n\nStella Artois has been associated with film in the UK since 1994, organising events, sponsoring television, and hosting a website. Stella Artois has been or is a primary sponsor of the Cannes, Melbourne, and Sundance film festivals, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Dallas International Film Festival, and the Little Rock Film Festival.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28490", "title": "Swedish cuisine", "text": "Swedish cuisine\n\nSwedish cuisine is the traditional food of the people of Sweden. Due to Sweden's large North–South expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.\n\nHistorically, in the far North, meats such as reindeer, and other (semi-) game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South. Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of meatballs and brown cream sauce with tart, pungent lingonberry jam (slightly similar in taste to cranberry sauce).\n\nSwedes have traditionally been very open to foreign influences, ranging from French cuisine during the 17th and 18th centuries, to the sushi and cafe latte of today.\n\nSwedish cuisine could be described as centered around cultured dairy products, crisp and soft (often sugared) breads, berries and stone fruits, beef, chicken, lamb, pork, eggs, and seafood. Potatoes are often served as a side dish, often boiled. Swedish cuisine has a huge variety of breads of different shapes and sizes, made of rye, wheat, oat, white, dark, sourdough, and whole grain, and including flatbreads and crispbreads. There are many sweetened bread types and some use spices. Many meat dishes, especially meatballs, are served with lingonberry jam. Fruit soups with high viscosity, like rose hip soup and blueberry soup (\"blåbärssoppa\") served hot or cold, are typical of Swedish cuisine. Butter and margarine are the primary fat sources, although olive oil is becoming more popular. Sweden's pastry tradition features a variety of yeast buns, cookies, biscuits and cakes; many of them are in a very sugary style and often eaten with coffee (\"fika\").\n\nThe importance of fish has governed Swedish population and trade patterns far back in history. For preservation, fish were salted and cured. Salt became a major trade item at the dawn of the Scandinavian middle ages, which began circa 1000 AD. Cabbage preserved as sauerkraut and various kinds of preserved berries, apples, etc. were used once as a source of vitamin C during the winter (today sauerkraut is very seldom used in Swedish cuisine). Lingonberry jam, still a favourite, may be the most traditional and typical Swedish way to add freshness to sometimes rather heavy food, such as steaks and stews.\n\nSweden's long winters explain the lack of fresh vegetables in many traditional recipes. In older times, plants that would sustain the population through the winters were cornerstones; various turnips such as the \"kålrot\" (rutabaga) (aptly named 'swede' in British English) were gradually supplanted or complemented by the potato in the 18th century. A lack of distinct spices made everyday food rather bland by today's standards, although a number of local herbs and plants have been used since ancient times. This tradition is still present in today's Swedish dishes, which are still rather sparingly spiced.\n\nBoth before and after this period, some new Germanic dishes were also brought in by immigrants, such as people related to the Hanseatic League, settling in Stockholm, Visby, and Kalmar. Swedish traders and aristocrats naturally also picked up some food traditions in foreign countries; cabbage rolls (\"kåldolmar\") being one example. Cabbage rolls were introduced in Sweden by Karl XII who came in contact with this dish at the time of the Battle of Poltava and during his camp in the Turkish Bender and later introduced by his Ottoman creditors, who moved to Stockholm in 1716. An of \"kåldolmar\" was first published in 1765 in the fourth edition of \"Hjelpreda i Hushållningen för Unga Fruentimber\" by Cajsa Warg, though it was closer to the Turkish \"dolma\" than later dishes.\nSwedish \"husmanskost\" denotes traditional Swedish dishes with local ingredients, the classical everyday Swedish cuisine. The word \"husmanskost\" stems from \"husman\", meaning 'house owner' (without associated land), and the term was originally used for most kinds of simple countryside food outside of towns. Genuine Swedish \"husmanskost\" used predominantly local ingredients such as pork in all forms, fish, cereals, milk, potato, root vegetables, cabbage, onions, apples, berries etc.; beef and lamb were used more sparingly. Beside berries, apples are the most used traditional fruit, eaten fresh or served as apple pie, apple sauce, or apple cake. Time-consuming cooking methods such as \"redningar\" (roux) and \"långkok\" (literally 'long boil') are commonly employed and spices are sparingly used. Examples of Swedish husmanskost are pea soup (\"ärtsoppa\"), boiled and mashed carrots, potato and rutabaga served with pork (\"rotmos med fläsk\"), many varieties of salmon (such as \"gravlax\", \"inkokt lax\", fried, pickled), varieties of herring (most commonly pickled, but also fried, \"au gratin\", etc.), fishballs (\"fiskbullar\"), meatballs (\"köttbullar\"), potato dumplings with meat or other ingredients (\"palt\"), potato pancake (\"raggmunk\"), varieties of porridge (\"gröt\"), a fried mix of pieces of potato, different kind of meats, sausages, bacon and onion (\"pytt i panna\"), meat stew with onion (\"kalops\"), and potato dumplings with a filling of onions and pork (\"kroppkakor\"). Many of the dishes would be considered comfort food for the nostalgic value.\n\nDishes akin to Swedish \"husmanskost\" and food traditions are found also in other Scandinavian countries; details may vary.\nSweden is part of the vodka belt and historically distilled beverages, such as \"brännvin\" and snaps, have been a traditional daily complement to food.\nConsumption of wine in Sweden has increased during the last fifty years, partly at the expense of beer and stronger alcoholic beverages.\nIn many countries, locally produced wines are combined with local \"husmanskost\".\n\n\"Husmanskost\" has undergone a renaissance during the last decades as well known (or famous) Swedish chefs, such as Tore Wretman, have presented modernised variants of classical Swedish dishes. In this \"nouvel husman\" the amount of fat (which was needed to sustain hard manual labour in the old days) is reduced and some new ingredients are introduced. The cooking methods are tinkered with as well, in order to speed up the cooking process or enhance the nutritional value or flavour of the dishes. Many Swedish restaurateurs mix traditional \"husmanskost\" with a modern, gourmet approach.\n\nSwedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.\n\nInternationally, the most renowned Swedish culinary tradition is the \"smörgåsbord\" and, at Christmas, the \"julbord\", including well known Swedish dishes such as \"gravlax\" and meatballs.\nIn Sweden, traditionally, Thursday has been \"soup day\" because the maids had half the day off and soup was easy to prepare in advance. One of the most traditional Swedish soups, \"ärtsoppa\" is still served in many restaurants and households every Thursday, a tradition since the middle ages. \"Ärtsoppa\" is a yellow pea soup, commonly served with pancakes as dessert. This is a simple meal, a very thick soup, basically consisting of boiled yellow peas, a little onion, salt and small pieces of pork. It is often served with mustard and followed by a dessert of thin pancakes (see \"pannkakor\"). The Swedish Armed Forces also serve their conscripts pea soup and pancakes every Thursday.\n\nPotatoes are eaten year-round as the main source of carbohydrates, and are a staple in many traditional dishes. Not until the last 50 years have pasta or rice become common on the dinner table.\nThere are several different kinds of potatoes: the most appreciated is the \"new potato\", a potato which ripens in early summer, and is enjoyed at the traditional midsummer feast. New potatoes at midsummer are served with pickled herring, chives, sour cream, and the first strawberries of the year are traditionally served as dessert.\n\nThe most highly regarded mushroom in Sweden is the chanterelle, which is considered a delicacy. The chanterelle is usually served as a side dish together with steaks, or fried with onions and sauce served on an open sandwich. Second to the chanterelle, and considered almost as delicious, is the porcini mushroom, or \"karljohansvamp\", named after Charles XIV John (Karl XIV Johan) who introduced its use as food.\n\nIn August, at the traditional feast known as \"kräftskiva\", crayfish party, Swedes eat large amounts of crayfish, boiled and then marinated in a broth with salt, a little bit of sugar, and a large amount of dill weed.\n\nSome Swedish dishes are:\n\nMeals consists of breakfast in the early morning (\"frukost\"), a light lunch before noon (\"lunch\"), and a heavy dinner (\"middag\") around six or seven in the evening. It is also common to have a snack, often a sandwich or fruit, in between meals (\"mellanmål\"). Most Swedes also have a coffee break in the afternoon, often together with a pastry (\"fika\"). In all primary schools, and most, but not all secondary schools, a hot meal is served at lunch as part of Sweden's welfare state. According to the Swedish school law, this meal has to be nutrient dense. \n\nBreakfast usually consists of open sandwiches (\"smörgås\"), possibly on crisp bread (\"knäckebröd\"). The sandwich is most often buttered, with toppings such as hard cheese, cold cuts, caviar, \"messmör\" (a sweet spread made from butter and whey), ham (\"skinka\"), and tomatoes or cucumber. \"Filmjölk\" (fermented milk), or sometimes yogurt, is also traditional breakfast food, usually served in a bowl with cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, or \"knäckebröd\", and sometimes with sugar, fruit or jam. Porridge is sometimes eaten at breakfast, made of rolled oats eaten with milk and jam or cinnamon with sugar. Common drinks for breakfast are milk, juice, tea, or coffee. Swedes are among the most avid milk and coffee drinkers in the world.\n\nSwedes sometimes have sweet toppings on their breads, such as jam (like the French and Americans), or chocolate (like the Danes), although many older Swedes chose not to use these sweet toppings. However, orange marmalade on white bread is common, usually with morning coffee or tea.\n\nMany traditional kinds of Swedish bread, such as \"sirapslimpa\" (less fashionable today, but still very popular) are somewhat sweetened in themselves, baked with small amounts of syrup. Like in many other European countries, there are also lots of non-sweetened breads, often made with sourdough (\"surdeg\"). Swedish breads may be made from wholegrain, fine grain, or anything in between, and there are white, brown, and really dark (like in Finland) varieties which are all common. \"Barkis\" or \"bergis\" is a localised version of \"challah\" usually made without eggs and at first only available in Stockholm and Göteborg where Jews first settled but now available elsewhere.\n\nA limited range of fish and other seafood is an important part of the Swedish cuisine. Farmed salmon from Norway has become increasingly popular. And pickled, sweetened herring, \"inlagd sill\", is the most traditional of Swedish appetizers. Shrimp and lobster are specialties of the Skagerrak coast. There is also the fermented Baltic herring that with its pungent aroma is both loved and hated ‒ in Swedish: \"surströmming\".\n\nCommon desserts include:\n\nIn recent years, American brownies, cookies, and cupcakes have become popular in Swedish cafés and restaurants.\n\n\"Bakelser\" and other types of \"kaffebröd\" (or more colloquially \"fikabröd\") are various forms of pastries, pieces of cake, cookies, and buns that are usually consumed, with coffee (see \"fika\"). Popular kinds of \"kaffebröd\" available in a traditional Swedish \"konditori\" (coffee shop / pâtisserie) include:\n\nIn the summer, various seasonal fruit cakes are common. Strawberry and cream cake is highly regarded. Strawberries are also often eaten on their own with sugar and milk or cream. In the late summer and autumn, apple cakes and pies are baked. The apple cake is often served with vanilla custard, but sometimes with ice cream or whipped cream.\n\nDuring the winter holidays, traditional candy and pastries include:\n\nOther typical Swedish candy includes:\nSweden is second placed among the heaviest coffee drinking countries in the world. Milk consumption in Sweden is also very high, second only to Finland. Milk is bought in milk cartons, and it is no coincidence that Tetra Pak, the world's largest maker of milk cartons, was founded in Sweden. Milk is considered the standard drink to have with meals during weekdays in many families, for both children and adults.\n\nFruit soups, especially rose hip soup and bilberry soup, are eaten or drunk, usually hot during the winter.\n\nThe most important of stronger beverages in the Swedish cuisine is \"Brännvin\", which is a general term that includes mainly two kinds of beverages: \"akvavit\" and vodka. When consumed traditionally it is often served as a \"snaps\", but vodka is also popularly consumed as a drink ingredient. Renat is often considered to be the national vodka of Sweden, but other highly popular brands are Explorer Vodka and Absolut Vodka, the latter being one of the world's best-known liquor brands. Most forms of \"brännvin\" have around 40% alcohol.\n\nThe production of hard liquor has a tradition dating back to the 18th century and was at a high in the 1840s. Since the 1880s, the state-owned Systembolaget has a monopoly on selling spirits with more than 3.5% ABV, limiting access. \"Hembränt\" (moonshine) used to be made in rural Sweden, but production has lessened in recent years due to more liberal rules for the import of alcohol as well as increased smuggling.\n\n\"Punsch\" is a traditional liqueur in Sweden that was immensely popular during the 19th century. It was adopted as the drink of choice by university students, and many traditional songs from that time are about the consumption of \"punsch\" or are meant to be sung during the collective festivities that were part of the cultural life in the universities' student associations at the time and still is.\n\nBeer is also widely consumed in Sweden and the typical Swedish beer is lager of a bright and malty kind. The brands Pripps Blå and Norrlands Guld are common examples. In the last few decades, many small breweries (\"microbreweries\") have emerged all over Sweden offering a wide range of styles and brands. Nils Oscar Brewery, Dugges Ale och Porterbryggeri and Närke Kulturbryggeri are examples of these young Swedish microbreweries. Many microbreweries in Sweden are inspired by the US craft beer movement, brewing American styles or styles commonly associated with American craft breweries, e.g. American Pale Ale and American IPA.\n\nBrödinstitutet ('The Bread Institute') once campaigned with a quotation from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, recommending eating six to eight slices of bread daily. Drinking milk has also been recommended and campaigned for by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare; it is often recommended to drink two to three glasses of milk per day. A survey conducted on behalf of Mjölkfrämjandet, an organisation promoting consumption of Swedish milk, concluded that 52% of Swedes surveyed drink milk at least once a day, usually one glass with lunch and another glass or two in the evening or morning.\n\nLow-fat products, wholemeal bread and other alternatives are common ‒ grocery stores usually sell milk in four or five different fat levels, from 3% to 0.1%.\n\n\n\n"}

This is the recipe as used in \"Larousse Gastronomique\", a seminal work of French \"haute cuisine\", first published in 1938.\n\nA light squeeze of lemon juice is commonly added. In many cases, chefs also choose to add finely chopped and lightly sautéed mushrooms to the dish, although this was not specifically mentioned in \"Larousse Gastronomique\" or by Auguste Escoffier, the \"Emperor of the World's Kitchens\", who was an arbiter of classic French cuisine.\n\nIt is possible to make a similar sauce to pass for \"sauce suprême\" by taking béchamel sauce (a classic mother sauce made with butter, flour and milk), with a poultry stock (effectively a shortcut to making a \"velouté\" by combining the roux and stock elements) and butter.\n\n\"The Cook's Decameron\" suggests the following recipe: the sauce is made by placing three-quarters of a pint of white sauce into a saucepan, and when it is nearly boiling, adding half a cup of concentrated fowl stock.

{"id": "28747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28747", "title": "Sangha", "text": "Sangha\n\nSangha is a word in Pali and Sanskrit meaning \"association\", \"assembly\", \"company\" or \"community\" and most commonly refers in Buddhism to the monastic community of bhikkhus (monks) and bhikkhunis (nuns). These communities are traditionally referred to as the \"bhikkhu-sangha\" or \"bhikkhuni-sangha\". As a separate category, those who have attained any of the four stages of enlightenment, whether or not they are members of the monastic community, are referred to as the \"āryasaṅgha\" \"noble Sangha\".\n\nAccording to the Theravada school, the term \"sangha\" does not refer to the community of sāvakas (lay followers) nor the community of Buddhists as a whole.\n\nIn a glossary of Buddhist terms, Richard Robinson et al. define Sangha as:\n\nMahayana practitioners may use the word \"Sangha\" as a collective term for all Buddhists, but the Theravada Pāli Canon uses the word \"pariṣā\" (Sanskrit \"pariṣad\") for the larger Buddhist community—the monks, nuns, lay men, and lay women who have taken the Three Refuges—with a few exceptions reserving \"Sangha\" for a its original use in the Pāli Canon—the ideal (\"arya\") and the conventional.\n\nThe \"Sangha\" is the third of the Three Jewels in Buddhism. Common over all schools is that the \"āryasaṅgha\" is the foremost form of this third jewel. As for recognizable current-life forms, the interpretation of what is the Jewel depends on how a school defines Sangha. E.g. for many schools, monastic life is considered to provide the safest and most suitable environment for advancing toward enlightenment and liberation due to the temptations and vicissitudes of life in the world.\n\nIn Buddhism, the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha each are described as having certain characteristics. These characteristics are chanted either on a daily basis and/or on Uposatha days, depending on the school of Buddhism. In Theravada tradition they are a part of daily chanting:\n\nThe Sangha: The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples (sāvakas) is:\n\nThat is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals - This Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is:\n\n\nThe Sangha was originally established by Gautama Buddha in the fifth century BCE in order to provide a means for those who wish to practice full-time in a direct and highly disciplined way, free from the restrictions and responsibilities of the household life. The Sangha also fulfils the function of preserving the Buddha’s original teachings and of providing spiritual support for the Buddhist lay-community. The Sangha has historically assumed responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the doctrine as well as the translation and propagation of the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThe key feature of Buddhist monasticism is the adherence to the vinaya which contains an elaborate set of 227 main rules of conduct (known as \"Patimokkha\" in Pāli) including complete chastity, eating only before noon, and not indulging in malicious or salacious talk. Between midday and the next day, a strict life of scripture study, chanting, meditation, and occasional cleaning forms most of the duties for members of the Sangha. Transgression of rules carries penalties ranging from confession to permanent expulsion from the Sangha.\n\nSaichō, the founder of the Japanese school of Tendai, decided to reduce the number of rules down to about 60 based on the Bodhisattva Precepts. In the Kamakura, many Japanese schools that originated in or were influenced by the Tendai such as Zen, Pure Land Buddhism and Nichiren Buddhism abolished traditional ordination in favor of this new model of the vinaya.\n\nThe Order of Interbeing, established in 1964 and associated with the Plum Village Tradition, has fourteen precepts observed by all monastics. They were written by Thích Nhất Hạnh.\n\nMonks and nuns generally own a minimum of possessions due to their samaya as renunciants, including three robes, an alms bowl, a cloth belt, a needle and thread, a razor for shaving the head, and a water filter. In practice, they often have a few additional personal possessions.\n\nTraditionally, Buddhist monks, nuns, and novices eschew ordinary clothes and wear robes. Originally the robes were sewn together from rags and stained with earth or other available dyes. The color of modern robes varies from community to community: saffron is characteristic for Theravada groups; blue, grey or brown for Mahayana Sangha members in Vietnam, maroon in Tibetan Buddhism, grey in Korea, and black in Japan.\n\nA Buddhist monk is a \"bhikkhu\" in Pali, Sanskrit \"bhikṣu\" while a nun is a \"bhikkhuni\", Sanskrit \"bhikṣuṇī\". These words literally mean \"beggar\" or \"one who lives by alms\", and it was traditional in early Buddhism for the Sangha to go on \"alms round\" for food, walking or standing quietly in populated areas with alms bowls ready to receive food offerings each day. Although in the vinaya laid down by the Buddha the Sangha was not allowed to engage directly in agriculture, this later changed in some Mahayana schools when Buddhism moved to East Asia, so that in the East Asian cultural sphere, the monastic community traditionally has engaged in agriculture. An emphasis on working for food is attributed to additional training guidelines laid down by a Chan Buddhist master, Baizhang Huaihai, notably the phrase, \"A day without work is a day without food\" ().\n\nThe idea that all Buddhists, especially Sangha members, practice vegetarianism is a Western misperception.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha rejected a suggestion by Devadatta to impose vegetarianism on the Sangha. According to the Pali Texts, the Buddha ate meat as long as the animal was not killed specifically for him. The Buddha in the Pali Canon allowed Sangha members to eat whatever food is donated to them by laypeople, except that they may not eat meat if they know or suspect the animal was killed specifically for them. Consequently, the Theravada tradition does not practice strict vegetarianism, although an individual may do so as his or her personal choice .\n\nOn this question Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions vary depending on their interpretation of their scriptures. In some Mahayana sutras, meat eating is strongly discouraged and it is stated that the Buddha did not eat meat. In particular, East Asian Sangha members take on the Bodhisattva Precepts originating in the \"Brahmajala Sutra\", which has a vow of vegetarianism as part of the Triple Platform Ordination, where they receive the three sets of vows: śrāmaṇera/śrāmaṇerī (novitiate), monastic, and then Bodhisattva Precepts, whereas the Tibetan lineages transmit a tradition of Bodhisattva Precepts from Asanga's \"Yogacarabhumi-sastra\", which does not include a vow of vegetarianism. In some areas such as China, Korea and Vietnam the Sangha practices strict vegetarianism, while in other areas such as Japan or Tibet, they do not.\n\nAccording to Mahayana sutras, Gautama Buddha always maintained that lay persons were capable of great wisdom and of reaching enlightenment. In some areas there has been a misconception that Theravada regards enlightenment to be an impossible goal for those outside the Sangha, but in Theravada suttas it is clearly recorded that the Buddha's uncle, a lay follower, reached enlightenment by hearing the Buddha's discourse, and there are many other such instances described in the Pāli Canon. Accordingly, emphasis on lay persons, as well as Sangha members, practicing the Buddhist path of morality, meditation, and wisdom is present in all major Buddhist schools.\n\nSome scholars noted that \"sangha\" is frequently (and according to them, mistakenly) used in the West to refer to any sort of Buddhist community. The terms \"parisa\" and \"gaṇa\" are suggested as being more appropriate references to a community of Buddhists. \"Pariṣā\" means \"following\" and it refers to the four groups of the Buddha's followers: monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen. The Sanskrit term \"gaṇa\" has meanings of \"flock, troop, multitude, number, tribe, series, class\", and is usable as well in more mundane senses.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai, a new religious movement which began as a lay organization previously associated with Nichiren Shōshū in Japan, disputes the traditional definition of sangha. It interprets the meaning of the Three Jewels of Buddhism, in particular the \"treasure of the Sangha,\" to include all people who practice Buddhism correctly, whether lay or clerical. Nichiren Shu holds this position as do some progressive Mahayana movements as well.\n\nNichiren Shoshu Buddhism maintains the traditional definition of Sangha as the head temple priesthood collective as sole custodians and arbiters of Buddhist doctrine.\n\n"}
{"id": "28896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28896", "title": "Scotch whisky", "text": "Scotch whisky\n\nScotch whisky (; often simply called Scotch) is malt whisky or grain whisky made in Scotland. Scotch whisky must be made in a manner specified by law.\n\nAll Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky.\n\nAll Scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years. Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement (NAS) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky contained in that bottle is at least three years old.\n\nThe first written mention of Scotch whisky is in the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, 1495. A friar named John Cor was the distiller at Lindores Abbey in Newburgh, Fife, where, in October 2017, malt whisky production restarted for the first time in 522 years.\n\nMany Scotch whisky drinkers refer to a unit for drinking as a dram.\n\nAs of 23 November 2009, the Scotch Whisky Regulations 2009 (SWR) define and regulate the production, labelling, packaging as well as the advertising of Scotch whisky in the United Kingdom. They replace previous regulations that focused solely on production. International trade agreements have the effect of making some provisions of the SWR apply in various other countries as well as in the UK. The SWR define \"Scotch whisky\" as whisky that is:\n\nA Scotch whisky label comprises several elements that indicate aspects of production, age, bottling, and ownership. Some of these elements are regulated by the SWR, and some reflect tradition and marketing. The spelling of the term \"whisky\" is often debated by journalists and consumers. Scottish, English, Welsh, Australian and Canadian whiskies use \"whisky\", Irish whiskies use \"whiskey\", while American and other styles vary in their spelling of the term.\n\nThe label always features a declaration of the malt or grain whiskies used. A single malt Scotch whisky is one that is entirely produced from malt in one distillery. One may also encounter the term \"single cask\", signifying the bottling comes entirely from one cask. The term \"blended malt\" signifies that single malt whisky from different distilleries are blended in the bottle. The Cardhu distillery also began using the term \"pure malt\" for the same purpose, causing a controversy in the process over clarity in labelling – the Glenfiddich distillery was using the term to describe some single malt bottlings. As a result, the Scotch Whisky Association declared that a mixture of single malt whiskies must be labelled a \"blended malt\". The use of the former terms \"vatted malt\" and \"pure malt\" is prohibited. The term \"blended malt\" is still debated, as some bottlers maintain that consumers confuse the term with \"blended Scotch whisky\", which contains some proportion of grain whisky.\n\nThe brand name featured on the label is usually the same as the distillery name (for example, the Talisker Distillery labels its whiskies with the Talisker name). Indeed, the SWR prohibit bottlers from using a distillery name when the whisky was not made there. A bottler name may also be listed, sometimes independent of the distillery. In addition to requiring that Scotch whisky be distilled in Scotland, the SWR require that it also be bottled and labelled in Scotland. Labels may also indicate the region of the distillery (for example, Islay or Speyside).\n\nAlcoholic strength is expressed on the label with \"Alcohol By Volume\" (\"ABV\") or sometimes simply \"Vol\". Typically, bottled whisky is between 40% and 46% ABV. Whisky is considerably stronger when first emerging from the cask—normally 60–63% ABV. Water is then added to create the desired bottling strength. If the whisky is not diluted before bottling, it can be labelled as cask strength.\n\nA whisky's age may be listed on the bottle providing a guarantee of the youngest whisky used. An age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old. In the early 21st century, such \"No age statement\" whiskies became more common, as distilleries responded to the depletion of aged stocks caused by improved sales.\n\nLabels may also carry various declarations of filtration techniques or final maturation processes. A Scotch whisky labelled as \"natural\" or \"non-chill-filtered\" has not been through a filtration process during bottling that removes compounds that some consumers see as desirable. Whisky is aged in various types of casks—and often in used sherry or port casks—during distinct portions of the maturation process, and will take on characteristics, flavour and aromas from such casks. Special casks are sometimes used at the end of the maturation process, and such whiskies may be labelled as \"wood finished\", \"sherry/port finished\", and so on.\n\nThere are two basic types of Scotch whisky, from which all blends are made:\n\nExcluded from the definition of \"single grain Scotch whisky\" is any spirit that qualifies as a single malt Scotch whisky or as a blended Scotch whisky. The latter exclusion is to ensure that a blended Scotch whisky produced from single malt(s) and single grain(s) distilled at the same distillery does not also qualify as single grain Scotch whisky.\n\nThree types of blends are defined for Scotch whisky:\n\nThe five Scotch whisky definitions are structured in such a way that the categories are mutually exclusive. The 2009 regulations changed the formal definition of blended Scotch whisky to achieve this result, but in a way that reflected traditional and current practice: before the 2009 SWR, any combination of Scotch whiskies qualified as a blended Scotch whisky, including for example a blend of single malt Scotch whiskies.\n\nAs was the case under the Scotch Whisky Act 1988, regulation 5 of the SWR 2009 stipulates that the only whisky that may be manufactured in Scotland is Scotch whisky. The definition of \"manufacture\" is \"keeping for the purpose of maturation; and keeping, or using, for the purpose of blending, except for domestic blending for domestic consumption\". This provision prevents the existence of two \"grades\" of whisky originating from Scotland, one “Scotch whisky” and the other, a \"whisky – product of Scotland\" that complies with the generic EU standard for whisky. According to the Scotch Whisky Association, allowing non-Scotch whisky production in Scotland would make it difficult to protect Scotch whisky as a distinctive product.\n\nThe majority of grain whisky produced in Scotland goes to make blended Scotch whisky. The average blended whisky is 60%–85% grain whisky.\nSome higher-quality grain whisky from a single distillery is bottled as single grain whisky.\n\nBlended malt whisky—formerly called \"vatted malt\" or \"pure malt\" (terms that are now prohibited in the SWR 2009)—is one of the least common types of Scotch: a blend of single malts from more than one distillery (possibly with differing ages). Blended malts contain only malt whiskies—no grain whiskies—and are usually distinguished from other types of whisky by the absence of the word \"single\" before \"malt\" on the bottle, and the absence of a distillery name. The age of the vat is that of the youngest of the original ingredients. For example, a blended malt marked \"8 years old\" may include older whiskies, with the youngest constituent being eight years old. Johnnie Walker Green Label and Monkey Shoulder are examples of blended malt whisky. Starting from November 2011, no Scotch whisky could be labelled as a vatted malt or pure malt, the SWR requiring them to be labelled blended malt instead.\n\nBlended Scotch whisky constitutes about 90% of the whisky produced in Scotland. Blended Scotch whiskies contain both malt whisky and grain whisky. Producers combine the various malts and grain whiskies to produce a consistent brand style. Notable blended Scotch whisky brands include Ballantine's, Bell's, Chivas Regal, Cutty Sark, Dewar's, J&B, Johnnie Walker, Teacher's Highland Cream, The Famous Grouse, and Whyte and Mackay.\n\nMost malt distilleries sell a significant amount of whisky by the cask for blending, and sometimes to private buyers as well. Whisky from such casks is sometimes bottled as a single malt by \"independent bottling\" firms such as Duncan Taylor, Master of Malt, Gordon & MacPhail, Cadenhead's, The Scotch Malt Whisky Society, Murray McDavid, Berry Bros. & Rudd, Douglas Laing, and others. These are usually labelled with the distillery's name, but not using the distillery's trademarked logos or typefaces. An \"official bottling\" (or \"proprietary bottling\"), by comparison, is from the distillery (or its owner). Many independent bottlings are from single casks, and they may sometimes be very different from an official bottling.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, some independent brands do not identify which facility distilled the whisky in the bottle. They may instead identify only the general geographical area of the source, or they simply market the product using their own brand name without identifying their source. This may, in some cases, be simply to give the independent bottling company the flexibility to purchase from multiple distillers without changing their labels.\n\nAccording to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a Scottish drink called \"uisge beatha\", which means \"water of life\". The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred as long ago as 1494, as documented in the \"Exchequer Rolls\", which were records of royal income and expenditure. The quote above records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae (Latin for \"water of life,\" = \"uisge beatha\") over the previous year. This would be enough for 1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well-established by the late 15th century.\n\nWhisky production was first taxed in 1644, causing a rise in illicit whisky distilling in the country. Between the 1760s and the 1830s a substantial unlicensed trade originated from the Highlands, forming a significant part of region's export economy. In 1782, more than 1,000 illegal stills were seized in the Highlands: these can only have been a fraction of those in operation. The Lowland distillers, who had no opportunity to avoid taxation, complained that un-taxed Highland whisky made up more than half the market. The heavy taxation during the Napoleonic Wars gave the illicit trade a big advantage, but their product was also considered better quality, commanding a higher price in the Lowlands. This was due to the method of taxation: malt was subject to tax (at a rate that climbed substantially between the 1790s and 1822). The licensed distillers therefore used more raw grain in an effort to reduce their tax bill. \n\nThe Highland magistrates, themselves members of the landowning classes, had a lenient attitude to unlicensed distillers - all of whom would be tenants in the local area. They understood that the trade supported the rents paid. Imprisoned tenants would not be able to pay any rent.\n\nIn 1823, Parliament eased restrictions on licensed distilleries with the \"Excise Act\", while at the same time making it harder for the illegal stills to operate. Magistrates found counsel for the crown appearing in their courts, so forcing the maximum penalties to be applied, with some cases removed to the Court of Exchequer in Edinburgh for tougher sentences. Highland landowners were now happy to remove tenants who were distillers in clearances on their estates. These changes ushered in the modern era of Scotch production: in 1823 2,232,000 gallons of whisky had duty paid on it; in 1824 this increased to 4,350,000 gallons.\n\nTwo events helped to increase whisky's popularity: first, the introduction in 1831 of the column still; the whisky produced with this process was generally less expensive to produce and also less intense and smoother, because a column still can perform the equivalent of multiple distillation steps in a continuous distillation process. Second, the \"phylloxera\" bug destroyed wine and cognac production in France in 1880.\n\nScotland was traditionally divided into four regions: The Highlands, The Lowlands, The Isle of Islay, and Campbeltown. Due to the large number of distilleries found there, the Speyside region is now also recognized by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) as a distinct region. The whisky-producing islands other than Islay are not recognised as a distinct region by the SWA, which groups them into the Highlands region.\n\n\nAlthough only five regions are specifically described, any Scottish locale may be used to describe a whisky if it is distilled entirely within that place; for example a single malt whisky distilled on Orkney could be described as \"Orkney Single Malt Scotch Whisky\" instead of as an Island whisky.\n\n\nNotes\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}
{"id": "29178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29178", "title": "Spaghetti", "text": "Spaghetti\n\nSpaghetti (; sing. \"spaghetto\") is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. \"Spaghettoni\" is a thicker form of spaghetti, while \"capellini\" is a very thin spaghetti. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Authentic Italian spaghetti is made from durum wheat semolina, but elsewhere it may be made with other kinds of flour. Typically the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.\n\nOriginally, spaghetti was notably long, but shorter lengths gained in popularity during the latter half of the 20th century and now it is most commonly available in lengths. A variety of pasta dishes are based on it, and it is frequently served with tomato sauce or meat or vegetables.\n\n\"Spaghetti\" is the plural form of the Italian word \"spaghetto\", which is a diminutive of \"spago\", meaning \"thin string\" or \"twine\".\n\nThe first written record of pasta comes from the Talmud in the 5th century AD and refers to dried pasta that could be cooked through boiling, which was conveniently portable. Some historians think that Berbers introduced pasta to Europe during a conquest of Sicily. In the West, it may have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century, as the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi attested, reporting some traditions about the Sicilian kingdom.\n\nThe popularity of spaghetti spread throughout Italy after the establishment of spaghetti factories in the 19th century, enabling the mass production of spaghetti for the Italian market.\n\nIn the United States around the end of the 19th century, spaghetti was offered in restaurants as \"Spaghetti Italienne\" (which likely consisted of noodles cooked past \"al dente\", and a mild tomato sauce flavored with easily found spices and vegetables such as cloves, bay leaves, and garlic) and it was not until decades later that it came to be commonly prepared with oregano or basil.\n\nSpaghetti is made from ground grain (flour) and water. Whole-wheat and multigrain spaghetti are also available.\n\nAt its simplest, spaghetti can be formed using no more than a rolling pin and a knife. A home pasta machine simplifies the rolling and makes the cutting more uniform. Fresh spaghetti would normally be cooked within hours of being formed. Commercial versions of 'fresh' spaghetti are manufactured.\nThe bulk of dried spaghetti is produced in factories using auger extruders. While essentially simple, the process requires attention to detail to ensure that the mixing and kneading of the ingredients produces a homogeneous mix, without air bubbles. The forming dies have to be water cooled to prevent spoiling of the pasta by overheating. Drying of the newly formed spaghetti has to be carefully controlled to prevent strands sticking together, and to leave it with sufficient moisture so that it is not too brittle. Packaging for protection and display has developed from paper wrapping to plastic bags and boxes.\n\nFresh or dry spaghetti is cooked in a large pot of salted, boiling water and then drained in a colander ().\n\nIn Italy, spaghetti is generally cooked \"al dente\" (Italian for \"to the tooth\"), fully cooked but still firm to the bite. It may also be cooked to a softer consistency.\n\n\"Spaghettoni\" is a thicker spaghetti which takes more time to cook. \"Spaghettini\" is a thinner form which takes less time to cook. \"Capellini\" is a very thin form of spaghetti (it is also called \"angel hair spaghetti\" or \"angel hair pasta\") which cooks very quickly.\n\nUtensils used in spaghetti preparation include the spaghetti scoop and spaghetti tongs.\n\nAn emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil), olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano, Parmesan and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.\n\nIn some countries, spaghetti is sold in cans/tins with sauce.\n\nIn the United States, it is sometimes served with chili con carne. Unlike in Italy, abroad spaghetti is often served with Bolognese sauce.\n\nIn the Philippines, an immensely popular variant is the Filipino spaghetti, which is distinctively sweet with the tomato sauce sweetened with banana ketchup or sugar. It typically uses a large amount of \"giniling\" (ground meat), sliced hotdogs, and cheese. The dish dates back to the period between the 1940s to the 1960s. During the American Commonwealth Period, a shortage of tomato supplies in the Second World War forced the development of the banana ketchup. Spaghetti was introduced by the Americans and was tweaked to suit the local Filipino predilection for sweet dishes.\n\n\"Sapaketti phat khi mao\" (Spaghetti fried drunken noodle style) is a popular dish in Thai cuisine.\n\n\nBy 1955, annual consumption of spaghetti in Italy doubled from per person before World War II to . By that year, Italy produced 1,432,990 tons of spaghetti, of which 74,000 were exported, and had a production capacity of 3 million tons.\n\nPasta provides carbohydrates, along with some protein, iron, dietary fiber, potassium and B vitamins. Pasta prepared with whole wheat grain provides more dietary fiber than that prepared with degermed flour.\n\nThe world record for the largest bowl of spaghetti was set in March 2009 and reset in March 2010 when a Buca di Beppo restaurant in Garden Grove, California, filled a swimming pool with more than of pasta.\n\nSpaghetti Westerns have little to do with spaghetti other than using the name as a shorthand for Italian.\n\nThe BBC television program \"Panorama\" featured a hoax program about the spaghetti harvest in Switzerland on April Fools' Day, 1957.\n"}
{"id": "29969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29969", "title": "Tea", "text": "Tea\n\nTea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the \"Camellia sinensis\", an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.\n\nTea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty, where it was used as a medicinal drink. An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo. It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and commercialization of the plant in India. Combined, China and India supplied 62% of the world's tea in 2016.\n\nThe term herbal tea refers to drinks not made from \"Camellia sinensis\": infusions of fruit, leaves, or other parts of the plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These are sometimes called \"tisanes\" or \"herbal infusions\" to prevent confusion with tea made from the tea plant.\n\nThe Chinese character for tea is 茶, originally written with an extra stroke as 荼 (pronounced \"tú\", used as a word for a bitter herb), and acquired its current form during the Tang Dynasty. The word is pronounced differently in the different varieties of Chinese, such as \"chá\" in Mandarin, \"zo\" and \"dzo\" in Wu Chinese, and \"ta\" and \"te\" in Min Chinese. One suggestion is that the different pronunciations may have arisen from the different words for tea in ancient China, for example \"tú\" (荼) may have given rise to \"tê\"; historical phonologists however argued that the \"cha\", \"te\" and \"dzo\" all arose from the same root with a reconstructed pronunciation \"dra\", which changed due to sound shift through the centuries. There were other ancient words for tea, though \"ming\" (茗) is the only other one still in common use. It has been proposed that the Chinese words for tea, \"tu\", \"cha\" and \"ming\", may have been borrowed from the Austro-Asiatic languages of people who inhabited southwest China; \"cha\" for example may have been derived from an archaic Austro-Asiatic root *\"la\", meaning \"leaf\".\nMost Chinese languages, such as Mandarin and Cantonese, pronounce it along the lines of \"cha\", but Hokkien and Teochew Chinese varieties along the Southern coast of China pronounce it like \"teh\". These two pronunciations have made their separate ways into other languages around the world.\n\nStarting in the early 17th century, the Dutch played a dominant role in the early European tea trade via the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch borrowed the word for \"tea\" (\"thee\") from Min Chinese, either through trade directly from Hokkien speakers in Formosa where they had established a port, or from Malay traders in Bantam, Java. The Dutch then introduced to other European languages this Min pronunciation for tea, including English \"tea\", French \"thé\", Spanish \"té\", and German \"Tee\". This pronunciation is also the most common form worldwide. The \"Cha\" pronunciation came from the Cantonese \"chàh\" of Guangzhou (Canton) and the ports of Hong Kong and Macau, which were also major points of contact, especially with the Portuguese traders who settled Macau in the 16th century. The Portuguese adopted the Cantonese pronunciation \"chá\", and spread it to India. However, the Korean and Japanese pronunciations of \"cha\" were not from Cantonese, but were borrowed into Korean and Japanese during earlier periods of Chinese history.\n\nA third form, the increasingly widespread \"chai,\" came from Persian چای \"chay\". Both the \"châ\" and \"chây\" forms are found in Persian dictionaries. They are derived from the Northern Chinese pronunciation of \"chá\", which passed overland to Central Asia and Persia, where it picked up the Persian grammatical suffix \"-yi\" before passing on to Russian as чай (, \"chay\"), Arabic as شاي (pronounced \"shay\" due to the lack of a sound in Arabic), Urdu as چائے \"chay\", Hindi as चाय \"chāy\", Turkish as çay, etc. The few exceptions of words for tea that do not fall into the three broad groups of \"te\", \"cha\" and \"chai\" are mostly from the minor languages from the botanical homeland of the tea plant from which the Chinese words for tea might have been borrowed originally. English has all three forms: \"cha\" or \"char\" (both pronounced ), attested from the 16th century; \"tea\", from the 17th; and \"chai\", from the 20th. However, the form \"chai\" refers specifically to a black tea mixed with sugar or honey, spices and milk in contemporary English.\n\nTea plants are native to East Asia, and probably originated in the borderlands of north Burma and southwestern China.\n\nChinese (small leaf) type tea (\"C. sinensis\" var. \"sinensis\") may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. However, since there are no known wild populations of this tea, the precise location of its origin is speculative.\n\nGiven their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam type tea (\"C. sinensis\" var. \"assamica\") may have two different parentages – one being found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu'er City) and the other in western Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species \"Camellia taliensis.\" Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam type tea (also \"C. sinensis\" var. \"assamica\"). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species \"Camellia pubicosta.\"\n\nAssuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. The divergence of Chinese small leaf tea and Assam tea would correspond to the last glacial maximum.\n\nTea drinking may have begun in the Yunnan region during the Shang Dynasty in China, when it was used for medicinal purposes. It is also believed that in Sichuan, \"people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction.\"\n\nChinese legends attribute the invention of tea to the mythical Shennong (in central and northern China) in 2737 BC although evidence suggests that tea drinking may have been introduced from the southwest of China (Sichuan/Yunnan area). The earliest written records of tea come from China. The word \"tú\" 荼 appears in the \"Shijing\" and other ancient texts to signify a kind of \"bitter vegetable\" (苦菜), and it is possible that it referred to many different plants such as sowthistle, chicory, or smartweed, as well as tea. In the \"Chronicles of Huayang\", it was recorded that the Ba people in Sichuan presented \"tu\" to the Zhou king. The Qin later conquered the state of Ba and its neighbour Shu, and according to the 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu who wrote in \"Ri Zhi Lu\" (日知錄): \"It was after the Qin had taken Shu that they learned how to drink tea.\" Another possible early reference to tea is found in a letter written by the Qin Dynasty general Liu Kun who requested that some \"real tea\" to be sent to him.\n\nThe earliest known physical evidence of tea was discovered in 2016 in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi'an, indicating that tea from the genus \"Camellia\" was drunk by Han Dynasty emperors as early as the 2nd century BC. The Han dynasty work, \"The Contract for a Youth\", written by Wang Bao in 59 BC, contains the first known reference to boiling tea. Among the tasks listed to be undertaken by the youth, the contract states that \"he shall boil tea and fill the utensils\" and \"he shall buy tea at Wuyang\". The first record of tea cultivation is also dated to this period (the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han), during which tea was cultivated on Meng Mountain (蒙山) near Chengdu. Another early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text by Hua Tuo, who stated, \"to drink bitter t'u constantly makes one think better.\" However, before the mid-8th century Tang dynasty, tea-drinking was primarily a southern Chinese practice. It became widely popular during the Tang Dynasty, when it was spread to Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.\n\nThrough the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.\n\nTea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century, at which time it was termed \"chá\". The earliest European reference to tea, written as \"Chiai\", came from \"Delle navigationi e viaggi\" written by a Venetian, Giambattista Ramusio, in 1545. The first recorded shipment of tea by a European nation was in 1607 when the Dutch East India Company moved a cargo of tea from Macao to Java, then two years later, the Dutch bought the first assignment of tea which was from Hirado in Japan to be shipped to Europe. Tea became a fashionable drink in The Hague in the Netherlands, and the Dutch introduced the drink to Germany, France and across the Atlantic to New Amsterdam (New York).\n\nThe first record of tea in English came from a letter written by Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, writing to a merchant in Macao requesting \"the best sort of chaw\" in 1615. Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fujian in 1637, wrote, \"\"chaa\" – only water with a kind of herb boyled in it \". Tea was sold in a coffee house in London in 1657, Samuel Pepys tasted tea in 1660, and Catherine of Braganza took the tea-drinking habit to the British court when she married Charles II in 1662. Tea, however, was not widely consumed in Britain until the 18th century, and remained expensive until the latter part of that period. British drinkers preferred to add sugar and milk to black tea, and black tea overtook green tea in popularity in the 1720s. Tea smuggling during the 18th century led to the general public being able to afford and consume tea. The British government removed the tax on tea, thereby eliminating the smuggling trade by 1785. In Britain and Ireland, tea was initially consumed as a luxury item on special occasions, such as religious festivals, wakes, and domestic work gatherings. The price of tea in Europe fell steadily during the 19th century, especially after Indian tea began to arrive in large quantities; by the late 19th century tea had become an everyday beverage for all levels of society. The popularity of tea also informed a number of historical events – the Tea Act of 1773 provoked the Boston Tea Party that escalated into the American Revolution, and the need to address the issue of British trade deficit caused by the demand for Chinese tea led to a trade in opium that resulted in the Opium Wars.\n\nChinese small leaf type tea was introduced into India in 1836 by the British in an attempt to break the Chinese monopoly on tea. In 1841, Archibald Campbell brought seeds of Chinese tea from the Kumaun region and experimented with planting tea in Darjeeling. The Alubari tea garden was opened in 1856 and Darjeeling tea began to be produced. In 1848, Robert Fortune was sent by the East India Company on a mission to China to bring the tea plant back to Great Britain. He began his journey in high secrecy as his mission occurred in the lull between the Anglo-Chinese First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860). The Chinese tea plants he brought back were introduced to the Himalayas, though most did not survive. The British had discovered that a different variety of tea was endemic to Assam and the northeast region of India and that it was used by the local Singpho people, and these were then grown instead of the Chinese tea plant and then were subsequently hybridized with Chinese small leaf type tea as well as likely closely related wild tea species. Using the Chinese planting and cultivation techniques, the British launched a tea industry by offering land in Assam to any European who agreed to cultivate it for export. Tea was originally consumed only by anglicized Indians; however, it became widely popular in India in the 1950s because of a successful advertising campaign by the India Tea Board.\n\n\"Camellia sinensis\" is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Some varieties can also tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England, Perthshire in Scotland, Washington state in the United States, and Vancouver Island in Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart on the Australian island of Tasmania and Waikato in New Zealand.\n\nTea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting. In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall a year and prefer acidic soils. Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour.\n\nTwo principal varieties are used: \"Camellia sinensis\" var. \"sinensis,\" which is used for most Chinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, and \"C. sinensis\" var. \"assamica,\" used in Pu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical varieties, many strains and modern clonal varieties are known. Leaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, with three primary classifications being, Assam type, characterised by the largest leaves; China type, characterised by the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambod type tea (\"C. assamica\" subsp. \"lasiocaly\") was originally considered a type of assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea. Darjeeling tea also appears to be hybrids between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea.\n\nA tea plant will grow into a tree of up to if left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are generally pruned to waist height for ease of plucking. Also, the short plants bear more new shoots which provide new and tender leaves and increase the quality of the tea.\n\nOnly the top of the mature plant are picked. These buds and leaves are called 'flushes'. A plant will grow a new flush every seven to 15 days during the growing season. Leaves that are slow in development tend to produce better-flavoured teas.\n\nPests of tea include mosquito bugs of the genus \"Helopeltis\" (which are true bugs that must not be confused with the dipteran) that can tatter leaves, so they may be sprayed with insecticides. In addition, there may be Lepidopteran leaf feeders and various tea diseases.\n\nPhysically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. It is a solution of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted from the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols and amino acids, but is a suspension when all of the insoluble components are considered, such as the cellulose in the tea leaves.\n\nCaffeine constitutes about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating to between and per 8-oz (250-ml) cup depending on the type, brand, and brewing method. A study found that the caffeine content of of black tea ranged from , while the caffeine content of of green tea ranged from , reflecting a significant difference. Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to caffeine.\nBlack and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant amounts, with the exception of the dietary mineral, manganese at per cup or 26% of the Daily Value. Because of modern environmental pollution, fluoride sometimes occur in tea. Certain types of brick tea made from old leaves and stems have the highest levels.\n\nThe astringency in tea can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols. These are the most abundant compounds in tea leaves, making up 30–40% of their composition.\nPolyphenols include flavonoids, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and other catechins.\n\nIt has been suggested that green and black tea may protect against cancer or other diseases such as obesity or Alzheimer's disease, but the compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect on human diseases.\n\nTea is generally divided into categories based on how it is processed. At least six different types are produced:\n\nAfter picking, the leaves of \"C. sinensis\" soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless immediately dried. An enzymatic oxidation process triggered by the plant's intracellular enzymes causes the leaves to turn progressively darker as their chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea unfit for consumption.\n\nAfter basic processing, teas may be altered through additional processing steps before being sold, and is often consumed with additions to the basic tea leaf and water added during preparation or drinking. Examples of additional processing steps that occur before tea is sold are blending, flavouring, scenting, and decaffeination of teas. Examples of additions added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.\n\nTea blending is the combination of different teas together to achieve the final product. Almost all tea in bags and most loose tea sold in the West is blended. Such teas may combine others from the same cultivation area or several different ones. The aim is to obtain consistency, better taste, higher price, or some combination of the three.\n\nFlavoured and scented teas add new aromas and flavours to the base tea. This can be accomplished through directly adding flavouring agents, such as Ginger or dried Ginger, Cloves, Mintleaves, Elaichi, bergamot (found in Earl Grey), vanilla, and spearmint. Alternatively, because tea easily retains odours, it can be placed in proximity to an aromatic ingredient to absorb its aroma, as in traditional Jasmine tea.\n\nThe addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de Sévigné. Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas tend to be very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity. The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style milk tea is based on British colonial habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink tea with milk or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries (Russia, Poland and Hungary) and in Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea with milk is called a \"bawarka\" (\"Bavarian style\"), and is often drunk by pregnant and nursing women. In Australia, tea with milk is \"white tea\".\n\nThe order of steps in preparing a cup of tea is a much-debated topic, and can vary widely between cultures or even individuals. Some say it is preferable to add the milk before the tea, as the high temperature of freshly brewed tea can denature the proteins found in fresh milk, similar to the change in taste of UHT milk, resulting in an inferior-tasting beverage. Others insist it is better to add the milk after brewing the tea, as black tea is often brewed as close to boiling as possible. The addition of milk chills the beverage during the crucial brewing phase, if brewing in a cup rather than using a pot, meaning the delicate flavour of a good tea cannot be fully appreciated. By adding the milk afterwards, it is easier to dissolve sugar in the tea and also to ensure the desired amount of milk is added, as the colour of the tea can be observed. Historically, the order of steps was taken as an indication of class: only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk. Higher temperature difference means faster heat transfer, so the earlier milk is added, the slower the drink cools. A 2007 study published in the \"European Heart Journal\" found certain beneficial effects of tea may be lost through the addition of milk.\n\nPopular varieties of black tea include Assam, Nepal, Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Rize, Keemun, and Ceylon teas.\n\nMany of the active substances in black tea do not develop at temperatures lower than 90 °C (194 °F). As a result, black tea in the West is usually steeped in water near its boiling point, at around 99 °C (210 °F). Since boiling point drops with increasing altitude, it is difficult to brew black tea properly in mountainous areas.\n\nWestern black teas are usually brewed for about four minutes. In many regions of the world, however, actively boiling water is used and the tea is often stewed. In India, black tea is often boiled for fifteen minutes or longer to make Masala chai, as a strong brew is preferred. Tea is often strained while serving.\n\nA food safety management group of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has published a standard for preparing a cup of tea (ISO 3103: \"Tea – Preparation of liquor for use in sensory tests\"), primarily intended for standardizing preparation for comparison and rating purposes.\n\nIn regions of the world that prefer mild beverages, such as the Far East, green tea is steeped in water around . Regions such as North Africa or Central Asia prefer a bitter tea, and hotter water is used. In Morocco, green tea is steeped in boiling water for 15 minutes.\n\nThe container in which green tea is steeped is often warmed beforehand to prevent premature cooling. High-quality green and white teas can have new water added as many as five or more times, depending on variety, at increasingly higher temperatures.\n\nOolong tea is brewed around 82 to 96 °C (185 to 205 °F), with the brewing vessel warmed before pouring the water. Yixing purple clay teapots are the traditional brewing-vessel for oolong tea which can be brewed multiple times from the same leaves, unlike green tea, seeming to improve with reuse. In the southern Chinese and Taiwanese Gongfu tea ceremony, the first brew is discarded, as it is considered a rinse of leaves rather than a proper brew.\n\nPu-erh teas require boiling water for infusion. Some prefer to quickly rinse pu-erh for several seconds with boiling water to remove tea dust which accumulates from the ageing process, then infuse it at the boiling point (100 °C or 212 °F), and allow it to steep from 30 seconds to five minutes.\n\nMeaning \"spiced tea\", masala chai tea is prepared using black or green tea with milk (in which case it may be called a \"latte\"), and may be spiced with ginger.\n\nWhile most tea is prepared using hot water, it is also possible to brew a beverage from tea using room temperature or cooled water. This requires longer steeping time to extract the key components, and produces a different flavor profile. Cold brews use about 1.5 times the tea leaves that would be used for hot steeping, and are refrigerated for 4–10 hours. The process of making cold brew tea is much simpler than that for cold brew coffee.\n\nCold brewing has some disadvantages compared to hot steeping. If the leaves or source water contain unwanted bacteria, they may flourish, whereas using hot water has the benefit of killing most bacteria. This is less of a concern in modern times and developed regions. Cold brewing may also allow for less caffeine to be extracted.\n\nThe flavor of tea can also be altered by pouring it from different heights, resulting in varying degrees of aeration. The art of elevated pouring is used principally to enhance the flavor of the tea, while cooling the beverage for immediate consumption.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the practice of pouring tea from a height has been refined further using black tea to which condensed milk is added, poured from a height from one cup to another several times in alternating fashion and in quick succession, to create a tea with entrapped air bubbles, creating a frothy \"head\" in the cup. This beverage, \"teh tarik\", literally, \"pulled tea\" (which has its origin as a hot Indian tea beverage), has a creamier taste than flat milk tea and is common in the region.\n\nTea may be consumed early in the day to heighten calm alertness ; it contains L-theanine, theophylline, and bound caffeine (sometimes called \"theine\"). Decaffeinated brands are also sold. While herbal teas are also referred to as tea, most of them do not contain leaves from the tea plant. While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, in many cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea party.\n\nTea ceremonies have arisen in different cultures, such as the Chinese and Japanese traditions, each of which employs certain techniques and ritualised protocol of brewing and serving tea for enjoyment in a refined setting. One form of Chinese tea ceremony is the \"Gongfu tea ceremony\", which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, tea is consumed daily and is perceived as one of Britain's cultural beverages. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea is consumed both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of scones, clotted cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some parts of Britain & India 'tea' may also refer to the evening meal.\n\nIreland has long been one of the biggest per-capita consumers of tea in the world. The national average is four cups per person per day, with many people drinking six cups or more. Tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar and is slightly spicier and stronger than the traditional English blend.\n\nTea is prevalent in most cultures in the Middle East. In Arab culture, tea is a focal point for social gatherings.\n\nTurkish tea is an important part of that country's cuisine, and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption. In 2004 Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported. In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at 2.7 kg. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.\n\nIn Iranian culture, tea is so widely consumed, it is generally the first thing offered to a household guest.\n\nRussia has a long, rich tea history dating to 1638 when tea was introduced to Tsar Michael. Social gatherings were considered incomplete without tea, which was traditionally brewed in a samovar, and today 82% of Russians consume tea daily.\n\nIn Pakistan, both black and green teas are popular and are known locally as \"sabz chai\" and \"kahwah\", respectively. The popular green tea called \"kahwah\" is often served after every meal in the Pashtun belt of Balochistan and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which is where the Khyber Pass of the Silk Road is found. In central and southern Punjab and the metropolitan Sindh region of Pakistan, tea with milk and sugar (sometimes with pistachios, cardamom, etc.), commonly referred to as \"chai\", is widely consumed. It is the most common beverage of households in the region. In the northern Pakistani regions of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, a salty, buttered Tibetan-style tea is consumed.\n\nIn the transnational Kashmir region, which straddles the border between India and Pakistan, Kashmiri chai or \"noon chai\", a pink, creamy tea with pistachios, almonds, cardamom, and sometimes cinnamon, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter months when it is sold in many kiosks.\nIndian tea culture is strong – the drink is the most popular hot beverage in the country. It is consumed daily in almost all houses, offered to guests, consumed in high amounts in domestic and official surroundings, and is made with the addition of milk with or without spices, and usually sweetened. At homes it is sometimes served with biscuits to be dipped in the tea and eaten before consuming the tea. More often than not, it is drunk in \"doses\" of small cups (referred to as \"Cutting\" chai if sold at street tea vendors) rather than one large cup. On 21 April 2012, the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission (India), Montek Singh Ahluwalia, said tea would be declared as national drink by April 2013. The move is expected to boost the tea industry in the country. Speaking on the occasion, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in the future to ensure its development. The history of tea in India is especially rich.\n\nIn Burma (Myanmar), tea is consumed not only as hot drinks, but also as sweet tea and green tea known locally as \"laphet-yay\" and \"laphet-yay-gyan\", respectively. Pickled tea leaves, known locally as \"laphet\", are also a national delicacy. Pickled tea is usually eaten with roasted sesame seeds, crispy fried beans, roasted peanuts and fried garlic chips.\n\nIn Mali, gunpowder tea is served in series of three, starting with the highest oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea, locally referred to as \"strong like death\", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added (\"pleasant as life\"), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added (\"sweet as love\"). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom, the \"Grin\", an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and extending late into the night, and is widely popular in Bamako and other large urban areas.\n\nIn the United States, 80% of tea is consumed as iced tea. Sweet tea is native to the southeastern US, and is iconic in its cuisine.\n\nIn 2016, global production of tea was about 6 million tonnes, led by China with 40% and India with 22% of the world total (table). Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Turkey were other major producers.\n\nTea is the most popular manufactured drink consumed in the world, equaling all others – including coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, and alcohol – combined. Most tea consumed outside East Asia is produced on large plantations in the hilly regions of India and Sri Lanka, and is destined to be sold to large businesses. Opposite this large-scale industrial production are many small \"gardens,\" sometimes minuscule plantations, that produce highly sought-after teas prized by gourmets. These teas are both rare and expensive, and can be compared to some of the most expensive wines in this respect.\n\nIndia is the world's largest tea-drinking nation, although the per capita consumption of tea remains a modest per person every year. Turkey, with of tea consumed per person per year, is the world's greatest per capita consumer.\n\nMultiple recent reports have found that most Chinese and Indian teas contain residues of banned toxic pesticides.\n\nTea production in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda has been reported to make use of child labor according to the U.S. Department of Labor's \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\" (a report on the worst forms of child labor).\n\nWorkers who pick and pack tea on plantations in developing countries can face harsh working conditions and may earn below the living wage.\n\nA number of bodies independently certify the production of tea. Tea from certified estates can be sold with a certification label on the pack. The most important certification schemes are Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, UTZ Certified, and Organic, which also certify other crops such as coffee, cocoa and fruit. Rainforest Alliance certified tea is sold by Unilever brands Lipton and PG Tips in Western Europe, Australia and the US. Fairtrade certified tea is sold by a large number of suppliers around the world. UTZ Certified announced a partnership in 2008 with Sara Lee brand Pickwick tea.\n\nProduction of organic tea has risen since its introduction in 1990 at Rembeng, Kondoli Tea Estate, Assam. tons of organic tea were sold in 1999. About 75% of organic tea production is sold in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIn 2013, China – the world's largest producer of tea – exported 325,806 tonnes, or 14% of their total crop. India exported 254,841 tonnes or 20% of their total production.\n\nIn 2013, the largest importer of tea was the Russian Federation with 173,070 tonnes, followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Pakistan.\n\nIn 1907, American tea merchant Thomas Sullivan began distributing samples of his tea in small bags of Chinese silk with a drawstring. Consumers noticed they could simply leave the tea in the bag and reuse it with fresh tea. However, the potential of this distribution and packaging method would not be fully realised until later on. During World War II, tea was rationed in the United Kingdom. In 1953, after rationing in the UK ended, Tetley launched the tea bag to the UK and it was an immediate success.\n\nThe \"pyramid tea bag\" (or sachet), introduced by Lipton and PG Tips/Scottish Blend in 1996, attempts to address one of the connoisseurs' arguments against paper tea bags by way of its three-dimensional tetrahedron shape, which allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. However, some types of pyramid tea bags have been criticised as being environmentally unfriendly, since their synthetic material is not as biodegradable as loose tea leaves and paper tea bags.\n\nThe tea leaves are packaged loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container such as a tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum-packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control at the expense of convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.\n\nCompressed tea (such as pu-erh) is produced for convenience in transport, storage, and ageing. It can usually be stored longer without spoilage than loose leaf tea.\n\nCompressed tea is prepared by loosening leaves from the cake using a small knife, and steeping the extracted pieces in water. During the Tang dynasty, as described by Lu Yu, compressed tea was ground into a powder, combined with hot water, and ladled into bowls, resulting in a \"frothy\" mixture. In the Song dynasty, the tea powder would instead be whisked with hot water in the bowl. Although no longer practiced in China today, the whisking method of preparing powdered tea was transmitted to Japan by Zen Buddhist monks, and is still used to prepare matcha in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\nCompressed tea was the most popular form of tea in China during the Tang dynasty. By the beginning of the Ming dynasty, it had been displaced by loose-leaf tea. It remains popular, however, in the Himalayan countries and Mongolian steppes. In Mongolia, tea bricks were ubiquitous enough to be used as a form of currency. Among Himalayan peoples, compressed tea is consumed by combining it with yak butter and salt to produce butter tea.\n\n\"Instant tea\", similar to freeze-dried instant coffee and an alternative to brewed tea, can be consumed either hot or cold. Instant tea was developed in the 1930s, with Nestlé introducing the first commercial product in 1946, while Redi-Tea debuted instant iced tea in 1953.\n\nDelicacy of flavour is sacrificed for convenience. Additives such as chai, vanilla, honey or fruit, are popular, as is powdered milk.\n\nDuring the Second World War British and Canadian soldiers were issued an instant tea known as \"Compo\" in their Composite Ration Packs. These blocks of instant tea, powdered milk, and sugar were not always well received. As Royal Canadian Artillery Gunner, George C Blackburn observed:\n\nCanned tea is sold prepared and ready to drink. It was introduced in 1981 in Japan.\n\nThe first bottled tea introduced by Indonesian tea company PT. Sinar Sosro in 1969 with brand name Teh Botol Sosro (or Sosro bottled tea).\n\nIn 1983, Swiss-based Bischofszell Food Ltd., was the first company to bottle iced tea on an industrial scale.\n\nStorage conditions and type determine the shelf life of tea. Black tea's is greater than green's. Some, such as flower teas, may last only a month or so. Others, such as pu-erh, improve with age.\n\nTo remain fresh and prevent mold, tea needs to be stored away from heat, light, air, and moisture. Tea must be kept at room temperature in an air-tight container. Black tea in a bag within a sealed opaque canister may keep for two years. Green tea deteriorates more rapidly, usually in less than a year. Tightly rolled gunpowder tea leaves keep longer than the more open-leafed Chun Mee tea.\n\nStorage life for all teas can be extended by using desiccant or oxygen-absorbing packets, vacuum sealing, or refrigeration in air-tight containers (except green tea, where discrete use of refrigeration or freezing is recommended and temperature variation kept to a minimum).\n\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "29985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29985", "title": "Taco", "text": "Taco\n\nA taco (, , ) is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese, allowing great versatility and variety. Tacos are generally eaten without utensils, often garnished with salsa, chili pepper, avocado, guacamole, cilantro (coriander), tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.\n\nThe origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical. According to the Real Academia Española, publisher of \"Diccionario de la Lengua Española\", the word \"taco\" describes a typical Mexican dish of a maize tortilla folded around food. This meaning of the Spanish word \"taco\" is a Mexican innovation, but in other dialects \"taco\" is used to mean \"wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood.\" In this non-culinary usage, the word \"taco\" has cognates in other European languages, including the French word \"tache\" and the English word \"tack (nail).\"\n\nAccording to one etymological theory, the culinary meaning of \"taco\" derives from its \"plug\" meaning as employed among Mexican silver miners, who used explosive charges in plug form consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.\n\nIndigenous origins for the culinary word \"taco\" are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word \"tlahco\", meaning \"half\" or \"in the middle,\" in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla. Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the Náhuatl word \"tlaxcalli\" (a type of corn tortilla).\n\nThe taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hernán Cortés arranged for his captains in Coyoacán.\n\nThere are many traditional varieties of tacos:\n\n\n\nAs an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions.\n\nThe hard-shell or crispy taco is a tradition that developed in the United states. Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century, various types of tacos become popular in the country, especially in Texas and California but also elsewhere. An early appearance of a description of the taco in the United States in English was in a 1914 cookbook, \"California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook\", by Bertha Haffner Ginger. The most common type of taco in the US is the hard-shell, U-shaped version, first described in a cookbook, \"The good life: New Mexican food\", authored by Fabiola Cabeza de Baca Gilbert and published in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1949. These types are sold by restaurants and by fast food chains, while kits are readily available in most supermarkets. Even non-Mexican oriented fast food restaurants have sold tacos. Mass production of this type of taco was encouraged by the invention of devices to hold the tortillas in the U-shape as they were deep-fried. A patent for such a device was issued to New York restaurateur Juvencio Maldonado in 1950, based on his patent filing of 1947 (U.S. Patent No. 2,506,305). Such tacos are crisp-fried corn tortillas filled with seasoned ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and sometimes tomato, onion, salsa, sour cream, and avocado or guacamole.\n\nTraditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco - usually by grilling or steaming. More recently, the term has come to include flour tortilla based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, \"soft tacos\" are tacos made with wheat flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.\n\nThe breakfast taco, found in Tex-Mex cuisine, is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, and can also contain other ingredients. Some have claimed that Austin, Texas is the home of the breakfast taco. However, food writer and \"OC Weekly\" editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a statement reflects a common trend of \"whitewashed\" foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas \"never had to brag about its breakfast taco love—folks there just call it 'breakfast'.\n\nIndian tacos, or \"Navajo tacos\", are made using frybread instead of tortillas. They are commonly eaten at pow-wows, festivals, and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the United States and Canada.\n\nSince at least 1978, a variation called the \"puffy taco\" has been popular. \"Henry's Puffy Tacos\", opened by Henry Lopez in San Antonio, Texas, claims to have invented the variation, in which uncooked corn tortillas (flattened balls of masa dough) are quickly fried in hot oil until they expand and become \"puffy\". Fillings are similar to hard-shell versions. Restaurants offering this style of taco have since appeared in other Texas cities, as well as in California, where Henry's brother, Arturo Lopez, opened \"Arturo's Puffy Taco\" in Whittier, not long after Henry's opened. Henry's continues to thrive, managed by the family's second generation.\n\nKits are available at grocery and convenience stores and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and taco sauce. Commercial vendors for the home market also market soft taco kits with tortillas instead of taco shells.\n\nThe tacodilla contains melted cheese in between the two folded tortillas, thus resembling a quesadilla.\n\nIn the United States, the \"National Taco Day\" is celebrated annually on October 4.\n\n"}
{"id": "30051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30051", "title": "Torch", "text": "Torch\n\nA torch is a stick with combustible material at one end, which is ignited and used as a light source. Torches have been used throughout history, and are still used in processions, symbolic and religious events, and in juggling entertainment. In some countries, the word \"torch\" is used as the term for a battery-operated portable light.\n\nFrom the Old French \"\"torche\"\" meaning \"twisted thing\", hence \"torch formed of twisted tow dipped in wax\", probably from Vulgar Latin *\"torca\", alteration of Late Latin \"torqua\", variant of classical Latin \"torques\" \"collar of twisted metal\", from \"torquere\" \"to twist\".\n\nTorch construction has varied through history depending on the torch's purpose. Torches were usually constructed of a wooden stave with one end wrapped in a material which was soaked in a flammable substance. In ancient Rome some torches were made of sulfur mixed with lime. This meant that the fire would not diminish after being plunged into water. Modern procession torches are made from coarse hessian rolled into a tube and soaked in wax. A wooden handle is usually used, and a cardboard collar is attached to deflect any wax droplets. They are an easy, safe and relatively cheap way to hold a flame aloft in a parade or to provide illumination in any after-dark celebration.\n\nModern torches suitable for juggling are made of a wooden-and-metal or metal-only stave with one end wrapped in a Kevlar wick. This wick is soaked in a flammable liquid, usually paraffin (kerosene).\n\nThe torch is a common emblem of both enlightenment and hope. Thus the Statue of Liberty, actually \"Liberty Enlightening the World\", lifts her torch. Crossed reversed torches were signs of mourning that appear on Greek and Roman funerary monuments—a torch pointed downwards symbolizes death, while a torch held up symbolizes life, truth and the regenerative power of flame. The torch is also a symbol used by political parties, for instance by both Labour (from 1918 to 1980) and the Conservatives (from 1983 to 2006) in the UK, and the Malta Labour Party. In the seals of schools in the Philippines, the torch symbolizes the vision of education to provide enlightenment to all the students.\n\nA torch carried in relay by runners is used to light the Olympic flame which burns without interruption until the end of the Games. These torches and the relay tradition were introduced in the 1936 Summer Olympics by Carl Diem, the chairman of the event because during the duration of the Ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, a sacred flame burnt inside of the temple of Hera, kept in custody by her priestess.\n\nJuggling torches are often used as a prop in toss juggling: they can be flipped into the air in an end-over-end motion while being juggled, in the same manner as juggling clubs or juggling knives, but because of their sound and 'trail of flame', they can appear much more impressive to audiences. To a skilled juggler, there is only a slight chance of being burned, but they are still dangerous.\n\nIn former times, liturgical torches were carried in Eucharistic processions simply to give light. The Church eventually adopted their use for Solemn High Masses.\n\nAccording to Adrian Fortescue, the more correct form of liturgical torches are non-freestanding (i.e. cannot stand up on their own). However, today, even in the Vatican, freestanding, tall candles in ornate candle-stick holders have replaced the former type. The torches are carried by torchbearers, who enter at the Sanctus and leave after Communion.\n\nAnglicans of the High Church and some Lutherans use torches in some of their liturgical celebrations as well.\nThe association of a torch with love may date to the Greek and Roman tradition of a wedding torch,\nlit in the bride's hearth on her wedding night, then used to light the hearth in her new home. Such a torch is associated with the Greek god of marriage Hymen.\n\nThe idiom to carry a torch (for someone) means to love or to be romantically infatuated with someone, especially when such feelings are not reciprocated. It is often used to characterize a situation in which a romantic relationship has ended, but where one partner still loves the other. It is considered by some to be dated, but still in wide usage. A torch song is typically a sentimental love song in which a female singer laments an unrequited love.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30365", "title": "Taoism", "text": "Taoism\n\nTaoism (, ), or Daoism (), is a religious or philosophical tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the \"Tao\" (, also romanized as \"Dao\"). The \"Tao\" is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order, but is similar in the sense that it is a teaching about the various disciplines for achieving \"perfection\" by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe called \"the way\" or \"dao\". Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize \"wu wei\" (action without intention), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 \"compassion\", 儉 \"frugality\", and 不敢為天下先 \"humility\".\n\nThe roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists), and was deeply influenced by one of the oldest texts of Chinese culture, the \"I Ching\", which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. The \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai (c. 400 – c. 337 BCE) may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei. The \"Tao Te Ching\", a compact book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (), is widely considered the keystone work of the Taoist tradition, together with the later writings of Zhuangzi.\n\nBy the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), the various sources of Taoism had coalesced into a coherent tradition of religious organizations and orders of ritualists in the state of Shu (modern Sichuan). In earlier ancient China, Taoists were thought of as hermits or recluses who did not participate in political life. Zhuangzi was the best known of these, and it is significant that he lived in the south, where he was part of local Chinese shamanic traditions.\n\nFemale shamans played an important role in this tradition, which was particularly strong in the southern state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own institution in contrast to shamanism, but absorbed basic shamanic elements. Shamans revealed basic texts of Taoism from early times down to at least the 20th century. Institutional orders of Taoism evolved in various strains that in more recent times are conventionally grouped into two main branches: Quanzhen Taoism and Zhengyi Taoism. After Laozi and Zhuangzi, the literature of Taoism grew steadily and was compiled in form of a canon—the Daozang—which was published at the behest of the emperor. Throughout Chinese history, Taoism was nominated several times as a state religion. After the 17th century, however, it fell from favor.\n\nTaoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries, and Taoists (, \"masters of the Tao\"), a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers, usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders, which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Taoism. Chinese alchemy (especially neidan), Chinese astrology, Chan (Zen) Buddhism, several martial arts, traditional Chinese medicine, feng shui, and many styles of qigong have been intertwined with Taoism throughout history. Beyond China, Taoism also had influence on surrounding societies in Asia.\n\nToday, the Taoist tradition is one of the five religious doctrines officially recognized in the People's Republic of China (PRC) as well as the Republic of China (ROC), and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots, it claims adherents in a number of societies, in particular in Hong Kong, Macau, and in Southeast Asia.\n\nSince the introduction of the Pinyin system for romanizing Mandarin Chinese, there have been those who have felt that \"Taoism\" would be more appropriately spelled as \"Daoism\". The Mandarin Chinese pronunciation for the word (\"way, path\") is spelled as \"tao<sup>4\" in the older Wade–Giles romanization system (from which the spelling 'Taoism' is derived) while it is spelled as \"dào\" in the newer Pinyin romanization system (from which the spelling 'Daoism' is derived). Both the Wade–Giles \"tao<sup>4\" and the Pinyin \"dào\" are intended to be pronounced identically in Mandarin Chinese (like the 'd' in 'dog'), but despite this fact, \"Taoism\" and \"Daoism\" can be pronounced differently in English vernacular.\n\nThe word \"Taoism\" is used to translate different Chinese terms which refer to different aspects of the same tradition and semantic field:\n\nHowever, the discussed distinction is rejected by the majority of Western and Japanese scholars. It is contested by hermeneutic (interpretive) difficulties in the categorization of the different Taoist schools, sects and movements. Taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single organized religion like the Abrahamic traditions; nor can it be studied as a mere variant of Chinese folk religion, as although the two share some similar concepts, much of Chinese folk religion is separate from the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. The sinologists Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn agree that \"Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations.\"\n\nChung-ying Cheng, a Chinese philosopher, views Taoism as a religion that has been embedded into Chinese history and tradition. \"Whether Confucianism, Daoism, or later Chinese Buddhism, they all fall into this pattern of thinking and organizing and in this sense remain religious, even though individually and intellectually they also assume forms of philosophy and practical wisdom.\" Chung-ying Cheng also noted that the Daoist view of heaven flows mainly from \"observation and meditation, [though] the teaching of the way (dao) can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature\". In Chinese history, the three religions of Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism stand on their own independent views, and yet are \"involved in a process of attempting to find harmonization and convergence among themselves, so that we can speak of a 'unity of three religious teaching' (sanjiao heyi)\".\n\nTraditionally, the Chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to the doctrines or the practices of Taoism, who fall instead within the field of folk religion. \"Taoist\", in Western sinology, is traditionally used to translate \"daoshi\" (道士, \"master of the Tao\"), thus strictly defining the priests of Taoism, ordained clergymen of a Taoist institution who \"represent Taoist culture on a professional basis\", are experts of Taoist liturgy, and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skills for the benefit of a community.\n\nThis role of Taoist priests reflects the definition of Taoism as a \"liturgical framework for the development of local cults\", in other words a scheme or structure for Chinese religion, proposed first by the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in \"The Taoist Body\" (1986). \"Daoshi\" are comparable to the non-Taoist \"fashi\" (法師, \"ritual masters\") of vernacular traditions (the so-called \"Faism\") within Chinese religion.\n\nThe term \"dàojiàotú\" (), with the meaning of \"Taoist\" as \"lay member or believer of Taoism\", is a modern invention that goes back to the introduction of the Western category of \"organized religion\" in China in the 20th century, but it has no significance for most of Chinese society in which Taoism continues to be an \"order\" of the larger body of Chinese religion.\n\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as one of the founders of Taoism and is closely associated in this context with \"original\" or \"primordial\" Taoism. Whether he actually existed is disputed; however, the work attributed to him—the \"Tao Te Ching\"—is dated to the late 4th century BCE.\n\nTaoism draws its cosmological foundations from the School of Naturalists (in the form of its main elements—yin and yang and the Five Phases), which developed during the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BC).\n\nRobinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism:\n\nSome elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition. In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring-States-era phenomena of the \"wu\" (connected to the shamanic culture of northern China) and the \"fangshi\" (which probably derived from the \"archivist-soothsayers of antiquity, one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself\"), even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case. Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to \"... magic, medicine, divination... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings\" as well as exorcism; in the case of the \"wu\", \"shamans\" or \"sorcerers\" is often used as a translation. The \"fangshi\" were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists, and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities.\n\nThe first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters') school (later known as Zhengyi school), developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142. The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.\n\nTaoism, in form of the Shangqing school, gained official status in China again during the Tang dynasty (618–907), whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. The Shangqing movement, however, had developed much earlier, in the 4th century, on the basis of a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi in the years between 364 and 370.\n\nBetween 397 and 402, Ge Chaofu compiled a series of scriptures which later served as the foundation of the Lingbao school, which unfolded its greatest influence during the Song dynasty (960–1279). Several Song emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the \"Daozang.\"\n\nIn the 12th century, the Quanzhen School was founded in Shandong. It flourished during the 13th and 14th century and during the Yuan dynasty became the largest and most important Taoist school in Northern China. The school's most revered master, Qiu Chuji, met with Genghis Khan in 1222 and was successful in influencing the Khan towards exerting more restraint during his brutal conquests. By the Khan's decree, the school also was exempt from taxation.\n\nAspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes under the Ming (1368–1644).\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), however, due to discouragements of the government, many people favored Confucian and Buddhist classics over Taoist works.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the imperial library was constituted, but excluded virtually all Taoist books. By the beginning of the 20th century, Taoism went through many catastrophic events.(As a result, only one complete copy of the Daozang still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing).\n\nToday, Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the People's Republic of China. The government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association. Taoism is freely practiced in Taiwan, where it claims millions of adherents.\n\nTaoism tends to emphasize various themes of the \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"Zhuangzi\", such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, wu wei. However, the concepts of those keystone texts cannot be equated with Taoism as a whole.\n\n\"Tao\" () literally means \"way\", but can also be interpreted as road, channel, path, doctrine, or line. In Taoism, it is \"the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course.\" It has variously been denoted as the \"flow of the universe\", a \"conceptually necessary ontological ground\", or a demonstration of nature. The Tao also is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves.\n\nThe active expression of Tao is called \"Te\" (also spelled—and pronounced—\"De\", or even \"Teh\"; often translated with \"Virtue\" or \"Power\"; ), in a sense that Te results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao.\n\nThe ambiguous term \"wu-wei\" () constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism. \"Wei\" refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while \"wu\" carries the meaning of \"there is no ...\" or \"lacking, without\". Common translations are \"nonaction\", \"effortless action\" or \"action without intent\". The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression \"wei wu wei\": \"action without action\".\n\nIn ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature. Taoist philosophy, in accordance with the \"I Ching\", proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. Taoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe. Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. \"By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction.\"\n\nNaturalness (; lit. \"self-such\"，\"self organisation\") is regarded as a central value in Taoism. It describes the \"primordial state\" of all things as well as a basic character of the Tao, and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity. To attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao; this involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire, and appreciating simplicity.\n\nAn often cited metaphor for naturalness is \"pu\" (; lit. \"uncut wood\"), the \"uncarved block\", which represents the \"original nature... prior to the imprint of culture\" of an individual. It is usually referred to as a state one \"returns\" to.\n\nThe Taoist \"Three Treasures\" or \"Three Jewels\" () comprise the basic virtues of \"ci\" (, usually translated as \"compassion\"), \"jian\" (, usually translated as \"moderation\"), and \"bugan wei tianxia xian\" (, literally \"not daring to act as first under the heavens\", but usually translated as \"humility\").\n\nAs the \"practical, political side\" of Taoist philosophy, Arthur Waley translated them as \"abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment\", \"absolute simplicity of living\", and \"refusal to assert active authority\".\n\nThe Three Treasures can also refer to jing, qi and shen (; jing is usually translated with \"essence\" and shen with \"spirit\"). These terms are elements of the traditional Chinese concept of the human body, which shares its cosmological foundation—Yinyangism or the Naturalists—with Taoism. Within this framework, they play an important role in neidan (\"Taoist Inner Alchemy\").\n\nTaoist cosmology is cyclic; relativity, evolution and 'extremes meet' are main characters. It shares similar views with the School of Naturalists (Yinyang) which was headed by Zou Yan (305–240 BCE). The school's tenets harmonized the concepts of the Wu Xing (Five Phases) and yin and yang. In this spirit, the universe is seen as being in a constant process of re-creating itself, as everything that exists is a mere aspect of qi, which, \"condensed, becomes life; diluted, it is indefinite potential\". Qi is in a perpetual transformation between its condensed and diluted state. These two different states of qi, on the other hand, are embodiments of the abstract entities of yin and yang, two complementary extremes that constantly play against and with each other and cannot exist without the other.\n\nHuman beings are seen as a microcosm of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.\n\nTaoism can be defined as pantheistic, given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness of the Tao and the primacy of the \"Way\" rather than anthropomorphic concepts of God. This is one of the core beliefs that nearly all the sects share.\n\nTaoist orders usually present the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities, visualizing the hierarchy emanating from the Tao. Laozi (\"Laojun\", \"Lord Lao\"), is considered the incarnation of one of the Three Purities and worshipped as the ancestor of the philosophical doctrine.\n\nDifferent branches of Taoism often have differing pantheons of lesser deities, where these deities reflect different notions of cosmology. Lesser deities also may be promoted or demoted for their activity. Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor, derived from the main of the Three Purities, as a representation of the most high God.\n\nPersons from the history of Taoism, and people who are considered to have become immortals (\"xian\"), are venerated as well by both clergy and laypeople.\n\nDespite these hierarchies of deities, traditional conceptions of Tao should not be confused with the Western theism. Being one with the Tao does not necessarily indicate a union with an eternal spirit in, for example, the Hindu sense.\n\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\" or \"Daodejing\" is widely considered the most influential Taoist text. According to legend, it was written by Laozi, and often the book is simply referred to as the \"Laozi.\" However, authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate, and will probably never be known with certainty. The earliest texts of the \"Tao Te Ching\" that have been excavated (written on bamboo tablets) date back to the late 4th century BCE. Throughout the history of religious Taoism, the \"Tao Te Ching\" has been used as a ritual text.\n\nThe famous opening lines of the \"Tao Te Ching\" are:\n\n道可道非常道 ()\n\"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao\"\n名可名非常名 ()\n\"The name that can be named is not the eternal name.\"\nThere is significant, at times acrimonious, debate regarding which English translation of the Tao Te Ching is preferable, and which particular translation methodology is best. The \"Tao Te Ching\" is not thematically ordered. However, the main themes of the text are repeatedly expressed using variant formulations, often with only a slight difference.\n\nThe leading themes revolve around the nature of Tao and how to attain it. Tao is said to be ineffable, and accomplishing great things through small means. Ancient commentaries on the \"Tao Te Ching\" are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the \"Heshang Gong\" commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE. Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xiang'er.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" (), named after its traditional author Zhuangzi, is a composite of writings from various sources, and is generally considered the most important of all Taoist writings. The commentator Guo Xiang (c. CE 300) helped establish the text as an important source for Taoist thought. The traditional view is that Zhuangzi himself wrote the first seven chapters (the \"inner chapters\") and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the \"outer\" and \"miscellaneous\" chapters). The work uses anecdotes, parables and dialogues to express one of its main themes, that is aligning oneself to the laws of the natural world and \"the way\" of the elements.\n\nThe \"I Ching,\" or \"Yijing,\" was originally a divination system that had its origins around 1150 BCE Although it predates the first mentions of Tao as an organised system of philosophy and religious practice, this text later became of philosophical importance to Daoism and Confucianism.\n\nThe \"I Ching\" itself, shorn of its commentaries, consists of 64 combinations of 8 trigrams (called \"hexagrams\"), traditionally chosen by throwing coins or yarrow sticks, to give the diviner some idea of the situation at hand and, through reading of the \"changing lines\", some idea of what is developing.\n\nThe 64 original notations of the hexagrams in the \"IChing\" can also be read as a meditation on how change occurs, so it assists Taoists with managing yin and yang cycles as Laozi advocated in the \"Tao Te Ching\" (the oldest known version of this text was dated to 400 BCE). More recently as recorded in the 18th century, the Taoist master Liu Yiming continued to advocate this usage.\n\nThe Daozang (, \"Treasury of Tao\") is also referred to as the Taoist canon. It was originally compiled during the Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties. The version surviving today was published during the Ming Dynasty. The Ming \"Daozang\" includes almost 1500 texts. Following the example of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka, it is divided into three \"dong\" (, \"caves\", \"grottoes\"). They are arranged from \"highest\" to \"lowest\":\n\n\n\"Daoshi\" generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose, or inherit, texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student.\n\nThe Shangqing school has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality.\n\nWhile the Tao Te Ching is most famous, there are many other important texts in traditional Taoism. \"Taishang Ganying Pian\" (\"Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution\") discusses sin and ethics, and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries. It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives. The wicked, and their descendants, will suffer and have shortened lives.\n\nLowe's summary of a Taoist worldview highlights points such as:\n\nThe \"taijitu\" (; commonly known as the \"yin and yang symbol\" or simply the \"yin yang\") and the \"bagua\" 八卦 (\"Eight Trigrams\") have importance in Taoist symbolism. In this cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang is the active principle, seen in all forms change and difference such as the annual season cycles, the landscape, sexual coupling, the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history. While almost all Taoist organizations make use of it, one could also regard it as Confucian, Neo-Confucian or pan-Chinese. One can see this symbol as a decorative element on Taoist organization flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. According to Song dynasty sources, it originated around the 10th century CE. Previously, a tiger and a dragon had symbolized yin and yang.\n\nTaoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. They typically feature mystical writing or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.\n\nA zigzag with seven stars is sometimes displayed, representing the Big Dipper (or the Bushel, the Chinese equivalent). In the Shang Dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while during the Han Dynasty, it was considered a \"qi\" path of the circumpolar god, \"Taiyi\".\n\nTaoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.\n\nAt ancient times, before Daoism Religion was founded, food may be set out as a sacrifice to the spirits of the deceased or the gods. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. The Daoist Celestial Master Zhang Daoling rejected food and animal sacrifices to the Gods. He tore apart temples which demanded animal sacrifice and drove away its priests. Nowadays Daoism Temples are still not allowed to use animal sacrifices. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of joss paper, or hell money, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. The joss paper is mostly used when memorizing ancestors, such as time of Qingming.\n\nAlso on particular holidays, street parades take place. These are lively affairs which invariably involve firecrackers and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include lion dances and dragon dances; human-occupied puppets (often of the \"Seventh Lord\" and \"Eighth Lord\"), Kungfu-practicing and palanquins carrying god-images. The various participants are not considered performers, but rather possessed by the gods and spirits in question.\n\nFortune-telling—including astrology, I Ching, and other forms of divination—has long been considered a traditional Taoist pursuit. Mediumship is also widely encountered in some sects. There is an academic and social distinction between martial forms of mediumship (such as \"tongji\") and the spirit-writing that is typically practiced through planchette writing.\n\nA recurrent and important element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally to the point of immortality. Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as xian.\n\nA characteristic method aiming for longevity is Taoist alchemy. Already in very early Taoist scriptures—like the \"Taiping Jing\" and the \"Baopuzi\"—alchemical formulas for achieving immortality were outlined.\n\nA number of martial arts traditions, particularly the ones falling under the category of Neijia (like T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Bagua Zhang and Xing Yi Quan) embody Taoist principles to a significant extent, and some practitioners consider their art a means of practizing Taoism.\n\nThe number of Taoists is difficult to estimate, due to a variety of factors including defining Taoism. According to a survey of religion in China in the year 2010, the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million (70% of the Chinese). Among these, 173 million (13%) claim an affiliation with Taoist practices. Further in detail, 12 million people claim to be \"Taoists\", a term traditionally used exclusively for initiates, priests and experts of Taoist rituals and methods.\n\nMost Chinese people and many others have been influenced in some way by Taoist traditions. Since the creation of the People's Republic of China, its government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao, but was re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the \"Baiyunguan\", or White Cloud Temple of Beijing, belonging to the Longmen branch of Quanzhen Taoism. Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.\n\nTaoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non-Chinese following until modern times. In Taiwan 7.5 million people (33% of the population) identify themselves as Taoists. Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong and Singapore show that, respectively, 14% and 11% of the people of these cities identify as Taoists.\n\nThroughout Chinese history there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoist thought. Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei, Huang Gongwang, Mi Fu, Muqi Fachang, Shitao, Ni Zan, T'ang Mi, and Wang Tseng-tsu. Taoist arts represents the diverse regions, dialects, and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy, however scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.\nDaoism never had a unified political theory. While Huang-Lao positions justified a strong emperor as the legitimate ruler, the \"primitivists\" (like in the chapters 8-11 of the Zhuangzi) argued in strongly for a radical anarchism. A more moderate position is presented in the Inner Chapters of the Zhuangzi in which the political life is presented with disdain and some kind of pluralism or perspectivism is preferred. The syncretist position in texts like the Huainanzi and some Outer Chapters of the Zhuangzi blended some daoist positions with confucian ones.\n\nMany scholars believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The philosophical terms \"Dao\" and \"De\" are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucian and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucian emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors \"naturalness\", spontaneity, and individualism instead.\n\nThe entry of Buddhism into China was marked by significant interaction and syncretism with Taoism. Originally seen as a kind of \"foreign Taoism\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism, like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng, knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts.\n\nTaoism especially shaped the development of Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introducing elements like the concept of \"naturalness\", distrust of scripture and text, and emphasis on embracing \"this life\" and living in the \"every-moment\".\n\nTaoism on the other hand also incorporated Buddhist elements during the Tang dynasty, such as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in tripartite organization.\n\nIdeological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, one of the most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and the \"Yijing\"), was a Confucian. The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalized when aspects of the three schools were synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school.\n\nSome authors have dealt with comparative studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been done by several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar. In neighboring Vietnam, Taoist values have been shown to adapt to social norms and formed emerging socio-cultural beliefs together with Confucianism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30529", "title": "Thai cuisine", "text": "Thai cuisine\n\nThai cuisine (, , ) is the national cuisine of Thailand.\n\nThai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. Thai chef McDang characterises Thai food as demonstrating \"intricacy; attention to detail; texture; color; taste; and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits, as well as good flavor\", as well as care being given to the food's appearance, smell and context. Australian chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines, Thai cooking rejects simplicity and is about \"the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish\".\n\nIn 2017, seven Thai dishes appeared on a list of the \"World's 50 Best Foods\"— an online poll of 35,000 people worldwide by \"CNN Travel\". Thailand had more dishes on the list than any other country. They were: tom yam goong (4th), pad Thai (5th), som tam (6th), massaman curry (10th), green curry (19th), Thai fried rice (24th) and mu nam tok (36th).\n\nThai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main regions of Thailand:\n\nThai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors have mutually influenced one another over the course of many centuries. Regional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and ethnicity on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with Shan State in Burma, northern Laos, and also with Yunnan Province in China, whereas the cuisine of Isan (northeastern Thailand) is similar to that of southern Laos, and is also influenced by Khmer cuisine from Cambodia to its south, and by Vietnamese cuisine to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of coconut milk and fresh turmeric, has that in common with Indian, Malaysian, and Indonesian cuisine. In addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the cosmopolitan palace cuisine of the Ayutthaya kingdom (1351–1767 CE). Its refinement, cooking techniques, presentation, and use of ingredients were of great influence to the cuisine of the central Thai plains.\n\nMany dishes that are now popular in Thailand were originally Chinese dishes. They were introduced to Thailand by the Hokkien people starting in the 15th century, and by the Teochew people who started settling in larger numbers from the late–18th century onward, mainly in the towns and cities, and now form the majority of Thai Chinese. Such dishes include \"chok\" (), rice porridge; \"salapao\" (steamed buns); \"kuaitiao rat na\" (fried rice-noodles); and \"khao kha mu\" (stewed pork with rice). The Chinese also introduced the use of the wok for cooking, the technique of deep-frying and stir frying dishes, several types of noodles, \"taochiao\" (fermented bean paste), soy sauces, and tofu. The cuisines of India and Persia, brought first by traders, and later settlers from these regions, with their use of dried spices, gave rise to Thai adaptations and dishes such as \"kaeng kari\" (yellow curry) and \"kaeng matsaman\" (massaman curry).\n\nWestern influences, starting in 1511 when the first diplomatic mission from the Portuguese arrived at the court of Ayutthaya, have created dishes such as \"foi thong\", the Thai adaptation of the Portuguese fios de ovos, and \"sangkhaya\", where coconut milk replaces cow's milk in making a custard. These dishes were said to have been brought to Thailand in the 17th century by Maria Guyomar de Pinha, a woman of mixed Japanese-Portuguese-Bengali ancestry who was born in Ayutthaya, and became the wife of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adviser to King Narai. The most notable influence from the West must be the introduction of the chili pepper from the Americas in the 16th or 17th century. It, and rice, are now two of the most important ingredients in Thai cuisine. During the Columbian Exchange, Portuguese and Spanish ships brought new foodstuffs from the Americas including tomatoes, corn, papaya, pea eggplants, pineapple, pumpkins, culantro, cashews, and peanuts.\n\nThai food was traditionally eaten with the hand while seated on mats or carpets on the floor or coffee table in upper middle class family, customs still found in the more traditional households. Today, however, most Thais eat with a fork and spoon. Tables and chairs were introduced as part of a broader Westernization drive during the reign of King Mongkut, Rama IV. The fork and spoon were introduced by King Chulalongkorn after his return from a tour of Europe in 1897 CE.\n\nImportant to Thai dining is the practice of \"khluk\", mixing the flavors and textures of different dishes with the rice from one's plate. The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth. A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table. It is common practice for both the Thais and the hill tribe peoples who live in Lanna and Isan to use sticky rice as an edible implement by shaping it into small, and sometimes flattened, balls by hand (and only the right hand by custom) which are then dipped into side dishes and eaten.\n\nChopsticks were foreign utensils to most ethnic groups in Thailand with the exception of the Thai Chinese, and a few other cultures such as the Akha people, who are recent arrivals from Yunnan Province, China. Traditionally, the majority of ethnic Thai people ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at Chinese, Japanese, or Korean restaurants. Stir fried noodle dishes such as \"pad Thai\", and curry-noodle dishes such as \"khanom chin nam ngiao\", are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.\n\nThai meals typically consist of rice (\"khao\" in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (\"khrueang chim\") is the most crucial component of any Thai meal. \"Khrueang chim\", considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy chili sauce or relish called \"nam phrik\" (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called \"lon\". The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy \"tom yam\" or a mellow \"tom chuet\"), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the \"kaeng\" prefix), a deep-fried dish and a stir fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.\nIn most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces (\"nam chim\") and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include: \"phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik\" (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes, sweet chili sauce, sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as \"khao kha mu\" (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole Thai peppers and raw garlic are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a garnish, especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the \"khanom chin\" (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy Thai curry or stir fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.\n\nWhen time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called \"khao rat kaeng\" (lit., \"rice covered with curry\"), or for short \"khao kaeng\" (lit., \"rice curry\"). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing their order at these places, Thais will state if they want their food served as separate dishes, or together on one plate with rice (\"rat khao\"). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made \"rice curry\" dishes on their menu for single customers.\n\nThailand has about the same land area as Spain and a length of approximately 1,650 kilometers or 1,025 miles (Italy, in comparison, is about 1,250 kilometers or 775 miles long), with the foothills of the Himalayas in the north, a high plateau in the northeast, a verdant river basin in the center, and tropical rainforests and islands in the south. With over 40 distinct ethnic groups each with its own culture and even more languages, it comes as no surprise that Thai cuisine, as a whole, features many different ingredients (\"suan phasom\"; ), and ways of preparing food.\n\nThai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain \"Borassus\" palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s. Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish play an important role in the diet of Thai people. Anna Leonowens (of \"The King and I\" fame) observed in her book \"The English Governess at the Siamese Court\" (1870):\n\n\"The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its \"platoo\", a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer's bowl of rice.\"\nFreshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the giant river prawn, need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature. Aquaculture of species such as Nile tilapia, catfish, tiger prawns, and blood cockles, now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand.\n\nLike most other Asian cuisines, rice is the staple grain of Thai cuisine. According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same: \"khao\". As in many other rice eating cultures, to say \"eat rice\" (in Thai \"\"kin khao\"\"; pronounced as \"keen cow\") means to eat food.\nRice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is \"\"kin khao reu yang?\"\" which literally translates as \"Have you eaten rice yet?\".\n\nThai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice. That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.\n\nNon-glutinous rice (\"Oryza sativa\") is called \"khao chao\" (lit., \"royal rice\"). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling jasmine rice (\"\"). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the patchwork of paddy fields that blanket Thailand's central plains. Once the rice is steamed or cooked, it is called \"khao suai\" (lit., \"beautiful rice\"). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for congee, of which there are three main varieties: \"khao tom\" (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish), \"khao tom kui\" (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or \"chok\" (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).\n\nOther varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include: sticky rice (\"khao niao\"), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Sticky rice, not jasmine rice, is a staple food in the local cuisines of northern Thailand and of Isan (northeastern Thailand), both regions of Thailand directly adjacent to Laos with which they share many cultural traits. Thai Red Cargo rice, an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.\n\nNoodles are usually made from either rice flour, wheat flour or mung bean flour. \"Khanom chin\" is fresh rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with spicy curries such as green chicken curry (\"khanom chin kaeng khiao wan kai\") or with salads such as \"som tam\". Other rice noodles, adapted from Chinese cuisine to suit Thai taste, are called \"kuaitiao\" in Thailand and come in three varieties: \"sen yai\" are wide flat noodles, \"sen lek\" are thin flat rice noodles, and \"sen mi\" (also known as rice vermicelli in the West) are round and thin. \"Bami\" is made from egg and wheat flour and usually sold fresh. They are similar to the Teochew \"mee pok\". \"Wun sen\", called cellophane noodles in English, are extremely thin noodles made from mung bean flour which are sold dried. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like \"phat Thai\" or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.\n\nRice flour (\"paeng khao chao\") and tapioca flour (\"paeng man sampalang\") are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.\nAn ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is \"nam pla\", a clear fish sauce that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is pla ra. It is more pungent than \"nam pla\", and, in contrast to \"nam pla\", which is a clear liquid, \"pla ra\" is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a \"som tam\" (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. \"Kapi\", Thai shrimp paste, is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called \"nam phrik kapi\", in rice dishes such as \"khao khluk kapi\" and it is indispensable for making Thai curry pastes. \"Tai pla\" is a pungent sauce used in the southern Thai cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the shortbodied mackerel (\"pla thu\"). It is one of the main condiments of \"kaeng tai pla\" curry and is also used to make \"nam phrik tai pla\". Far removed from the nearest sea, from northern Thailand comes \"nam pu\", a thick, black paste made by boiling mashed rice-paddy crabs for hours. It is used as an ingredient for certain northern Thai salads, curries, and chili pastes. It too has a strong and pungent flavor.\n\"Nam phrik\" are Thai chili pastes, similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian sambals. Each region has its own special versions. The words \"\"nam phrik\"\" are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called \"nam chim\". Thai curry pastes are normally called \"phrik kaeng\" or \"khrueang kaeng\" (lit. curry ingredients), but some people also use the word \"nam phrik\" to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called \"phrik kaeng phet\" or \"khrueang kaeng phet\" in Thai, but also \"nam phrik kaeng phet\". Both \"nam phrik\" and \"phrik kaeng\" are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a mortar and pestle. Some \"nam phrik\" are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is \"nam phrik num\", a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called \"nam phrik phao\" is often used as an ingredient in \"tom yam\" or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy \"jam\" on bread, or served as a dip with prawn crackers. The dry \"nam phrik kung\", made with pounded dried shrimp (\"kung haeng\"), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat Simon de la Loubère observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for \"nam phrik\" with \"pla ra\" and onions in \"Du Royaume de Siam\", an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691.\n\nThe soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially) loanwords from the Teochew dialect: \"si-io dam\" (black soy sauce), \"si-io khao\" (light soy sauce), \"si-io wan\" (sweet soy sauce), and \"taochiao\" (fermented whole soy beans). \"Namman hoi\" (oyster sauce) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.\n\nThai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of kaffir lime leaves (\"bai makrut\") appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour \"tom yam\") or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai lime (\"manao\") is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with galangal (\"kha\") and lemongrass (\"takhrai\"), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh Thai basil, distinctively redolent of cloves, and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as green curry. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include \"phak chi\", (coriander or cilantro leaves), \"rak phak chi\" (cilantro/coriander roots), spearmint (\"saranae\"), holy basil (\"kraphao\"), ginger (\"khing\"), turmeric (\"khamin\"), fingerroot (\"krachai\"), culantro (\"phak chi farang\"), pandanus leaves (\"bai toei\"), and Thai lemon basil (\"maenglak\"). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include \"phong phalo\" (five-spice powder), \"phong kari\" (curry powder), and fresh and dried peppercorns (\"phrik thai\"). Northern Thai \"larb\" uses a very elaborate spice mix, called \"phrik lap\", which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon.\n\nBesides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as \"cha-om\", the young feathery leaves of the \"Acacia pennata\" tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads. Banana leaves are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in \"ho mok pla\", a spicy steamed pâté or soufflé made with fish and coconut milk. Banana flowers are also used in Thai salads or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the neem tree (\"sadao\") are also eaten blanched. \"Phak lueat\" (leaves from the \"Ficus virens\") are cooked in curries, and \"bai makok\" (from the \"Spondias mombin\") can be eaten raw with a chili paste.\n\nFive main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about ) and is known as the hottest chili: \"phrik khi nu suan\" (\"garden mouse-dropping chili\"). The slightly larger chili \"phrik khi nu\" (\"mouse-dropping chili\") is the next hottest. The green or red \"phrik chi fa\" (\"sky pointing chili\") is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large \" phrik yuak\", which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies: \"phrik haeng\" are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.\n\nOther typical ingredients are the several types of eggplant (\"makhuea\") used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized \"makhuea phuang\" and the egg-sized \"makhuea suai\", often also eaten raw. Although broccoli is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in \"phat phak ruam\" (stir fried mixed vegetables) and \"rat na\" (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand, khana is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are \"thua fak yao\" (yardlong beans), \"thua ngok\" (bean sprouts), \"no mai\" (bamboo shoots), tomatoes, cucumbers, \"phak tam lueng\" (\"Coccinia grandis\"), \"phak kha na\" (Chinese kale), \"phak kwangtung\" (choy sum), sweet potatoes (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of squash, \"phak krathin\" (\"Leucaena leucocephala\"), \"sato\" (\"Parkia speciosa\"), \"tua phū\" (winged beans) and \"khaophot\" (corn).\n\nAmong the green, leafy vegetables and herbs that are usually eaten raw in a meal or as a side dish in Thailand, the most important are: \"phak bung\" (morning glory), \"horapha\" (Thai basil), \"bai bua bok\" (Asian pennywort), \"phak kachet\" (water mimosa), \"phak kat khao\" (Chinese cabbage), \"phak phai\" (praew leaves), \"phak kayang\" (rice paddy herb), \"phak chi farang\" (culantro), \"phak tiu\" (\"Cratoxylum formosum\"), \"phak \"phaai\"\" (yellow burr head) and \"kalamplī\" (cabbage). Some of these leaves are highly perishable and must be used within a couple of days.\n\nSeveral types of mushroom (\"het\") also feature in Thai cuisine such as straw mushrooms (\"het fang\"), shiitake (\"het hom\"), and white jelly fungus (\"het hu nu khao\").\n\nFlowers are also commonly used ingredients in many Thai dishes, either as a vegetable, such as \"dok khae\" (\"Sesbania grandiflora\") and \"huapli\" (the flower bud of the banana), or as a food coloring, such as with the blue-colored \"dok anchan\" (the flowers of the \"Clitoria ternatea\", which can also be eaten raw or fried).\nFresh fruit forms a large part of the Thai diet, and are customarily served after a meal as dessert. The Scottish author John Crawfurd, sent on an embassy to Bangkok in 1822, writes in his account of the journey:\n\n\"The fruits of Siam, or at least of the neighbourhood of Bangkok, are excellent and various, surpassing, according to the experience of our party (...) those of all other parts of India.\" The Siamese themselves consume great quantities of fruit, and the whole neighbourhood of Bangkok is one forest of fruit trees.\n\nFruit is not only eaten on its own, but often served with spicy dips made from sugar, salt, and chilies. Fruits feature in spicy salads such as \"som tam\" (green papaya salad) and \"yam som-o\" (pomelo salad), in soups with tamarind juice such as \"tom khlong\" and \"kaeng som\", and in Thai curries such as \"kaeng kanun\" (jackfruit curry), \"kaeng pet phet yang\" (grilled duck curry with pineapple or grapes), and \"kaeng pla sapparot\" (fish and pineapple curry). Fruits are also used in certain Thai chili pastes, such as in \"nam phrik long rue\" made with \"madan\" (a close relative of the mangosteen), and \"nam phrik luk nam liap\", salted black Chinese olive chilli paste.\n\nAlthough many of the exotic fruits of Thailand may have been sometimes unavailable in Western countries, Asian markets now import such fruits as rambutan and lychees. In Thailand one can find papaya, jackfruit, mango, mangosteen, langsat, longan, pomelo, pineapple, rose apples, durian, Burmese grapes and other native fruits. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the \"World Durian Festival\" in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand and a quarter of the world production. The \"Langsat Festival\" is held each year in Uttaradit on weekends in September. The \"langsat\" (\"Lansium parasiticum\"), for which Uttaradit is famous, is a fruit that is similar in taste to the longan.\n\nFrom the coconut comes coconut milk, used both in curries and desserts, and coconut oil. The juice of a green coconut can be served as a drink and the young flesh is eaten in either sweet or savory dishes. The grated flesh of a mature coconut is used raw or toasted in sweets, salads and snacks such as \"miang kham\". Thais not only consume products derived from the nut (actually a drupe), but they also make use of the growth bud of the palm tree as a vegetable. From the stalk of the flowers comes a sap that can be used to make coconut vinegar, alcoholic beverages, and sugar. Coconut milk and other coconut-derived ingredients feature heavily in the cuisines of central and southern Thailand. In contrast to these regions, coconut palms do not grow as well in northern and northeastern Thailand, where in wintertime the temperatures are lower and where there is a dry season that can last five to six months. In northern Thai cuisine, only a few dishes, most notably the noodle soup \"khao soi\", use coconut milk. In the southern parts of northeastern Thailand, where the region borders Cambodia, one can again find dishes containing coconut. It is also here that the people eat non-glutinous rice, just as in central and southern Thailand, and not glutinous rice as they do in northern Thailand and in the rest of northeastern Thailand.\n\nApples, pears, peaches, grapes, and strawberries, which do not traditionally grow in Thailand and in the past had to be imported, have become increasingly popular in the last few decades since they were introduced to Thai farmers by the Thai Royal Projects, starting in 1969, and the Doi Tung Project since 1988. These temperate fruit grow especially well in the cooler, northern Thai highlands, where they were initially introduced as a replacement for the cultivation of opium, together with other crops such as cabbages, tea, and arabica coffee.\n\nAccording to the Thai government's \"The Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan (2012–2016)\", Thailand is number one in the world in the application of chemicals in agriculture. The report stated that, \"The use of chemicals in the agricultural and industrial sectors is growing while control mechanisms are ineffective making Thailand rank first in the world in the use of registered chemicals in agriculture.\"\n\nThe Thai Pesticide Alert Network (Thai-PAN), a food safety advocacy group, regularly tests Thai farm produce for contamination. In their August 2016 evaluation, the group found that of 158 samples, 56 percent of produce was found to have unsafe levels of chemicals. A spokesperson for the group said that 70.2 percent of the produce from supermarkets was contaminated. Chinese kale topped the list of contaminated vegetables with 10 out of 11 samples containing residues. Red chillies (9 of 12) came in second, followed by cowpeas and basil (8 of 12), morning glory (7 of 12), small eggplants (6 of 11), cucumbers (5 of 11), tomatoes (3 of 11), cabbage (2 of 11), and Chinese cabbage (2 of 12). Among fruits, Sai Nam Phueng oranges were most contaminated as traces of chemicals were found in all eight samples. They were followed by dragon fruit (7 of 8), guava (6 of 7), papaya (3 of 6), watermelon (3 of 7), and cantaloupe (1 of 7).\n\n\"Q-Mark\" goods showed a higher prevalence of contamination, 61.5 percent, than they did during Thai-PAN's March 2016 survey, 57 percent. Q-Mark is the National Bureau of Agricultural Commodity and Food Standards (ACFS) mark of quality.\n\nIn a survey of hydroponically-grown vegetables, Thai-PAN, in late-2017, tested 30 hydroponic vegetables purchased at Thai fresh markets and supermarkets. Of 30 vegetables tested, 19 contained noxious chemical levels above maximum limits. Three samples were contaminated, but at levels below the legal maximum. Eight samples were free of harmful chemicals.\n\n\nWhereas many Thai dishes are now familiar in the West, the vast majority are not. In many of the dishes below, different kinds of protein, or combinations of protein, are interchangeable as the main ingredient. Beef (\"nuea\"), chicken (\"kai\"), pork (\"mu\"), duck (\"pet\"), tofu (\"taohu\"), fish (\"pla\"), prawns or shrimp (\"kung\"), crab (\"pu\"), shellfish (\"hoi\"), or egg (\"khai\") can, for example, all be used as main ingredients for \"kaeng phet\" (red curry). Thus \"kaeng phet kai\" is red curry with chicken and \"kaeng phet mu\" is red curry made with pork.\n\nKhao chao (; lit. \"morning rice/food\"), breakfast dishes, for Thais are limited. Very often, a Thai breakfast can consist of the same dishes with rice which are also eaten for lunch or dinner. Single dishes such as fried rice, noodle soups, and steamed rice with something simple such as an omelette, fried/grilled pork or chicken, or a stir fry with vegetables, are commonly sold for breakfast from street stalls as a quick take-out.\n\nThe following dishes are viewed as being specific breakfast dishes but they can also be found at any other moment of the day:\n\nKnown as ahan chan diao (; lit., \"single dish food\"), it is not only the name for true single plate dishes, but also for dishes that are served \"\"rat khao\"\" (lit., \"poured on rice\"): one or more dishes are served together with rice on one plate. Some of these eateries offer a large selection of (pre-cooked) dishes, others are specialized in only a one, or a few dishes with rice.\n\nAhan Phak Klang (; lit. \"central region food\") is most often eaten with the non-glutinous jasmine rice. The cuisine has also incorporated many Thai Chinese dishes.\n\nAhan Isan (; lit. \"Isan food\") generally features dishes similar to those found in Laos, as Isan people historically have close ties with Lao culture and speak a language that is generally mutually intelligible with the Lao language. The staple food of Isan is glutinous rice and most of the Isaan food is spicy and cooked with local ingredients found on the farms all through northeastern Thailand. Isaan people primarily get their income from farming. Rice, sugar cane, pineapple, potato, and rubber are all farmed in this region.\n\nAhan Lanna (; lit. \"Lanna food\") shares certain dishes with neighboring Shan State, in Burma, and with Laos. As in northeastern Thailand, glutinous rice, not jasmine rice, is eaten as the staple food.\n\nAhan Phak Tai (; lit. \"southern region food\") shares certain dishes with the cuisine of northern Malaysia. Southern Thais, just like the people of central Thailand to the north, and the people of Malaysia to the south, eat non-glutinous rice as their staple food.\n\n\n(; ) lit. \"sweet things\"). Although most Thai meals finish with fresh fruit, sometimes sweet snacks, often eaten between meals, will also be served as a dessert.\n\n\nIce cream was introduced to Thailand during the reign of King Rama V when the first ice cream machine was imported to Thailand. Ice cream in the second half of the 19th century was made of coconut water blended with ice. At first, ice couldn't be produced in Thailand. That led to importing ice from Singapore. Ice cream was then an upper-class treat, but over time ice cream became more widely available and the product was improved by replacing coconut water with coconut milk.\n\nThere were two types of ice cream in Thailand. First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream \"tube\" was born during the reign of Rama VII. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice cream cold. Eventually, ice cream was manufactured and sold in small cups.\n\nAccording to the \"Bangkok Post\", \"aitim tat\" (; \"cut ice cream\"), was very popular 30 years ago (1986). It came in rectangular bars of various flavors, sliced into pieces by the vendor, who then inserted two wooden sticks into the pieces to use as holders. \"Aitim tat\" was made from milk, coconut milk, flour, sugar, and artificial flavour. The price was one or two baht, depending on the size.\n\nThe Pop Company in the 1970s set up the first ice-cream manufacturing plant in Thailand. The company used a duck logo, resulting it the nickname \"aitim tra pet\" (; \"duck brand ice cream\"). It was sold in front of Chaloemchai Theater. Its most popular offering was called \"banana split\", with three flavors of ice cream, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.\n\nKhrueang duem (; lit. \"beverages\")\n\nOther alcoholic beverages from Thailand include Mekhong whisky and Sang Som. Several brands of beer are brewed in Thailand, the two biggest brands are Singha and Chang.\n\nEdible insects, whole or in chili paste and as ingredients in fortified products, are common in Thailand. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that there are about 20,000 cricket farms alone in 53 of Thailand's 76 provinces.\n\nA wide range of insects are eaten in Thailand, especially in Isan and in the north. Many markets in Thailand sell deep-fried grasshoppers, crickets (\"ching rit\"), bee larvae, silkworm (\"non mai\"), ant eggs (\"khai mot\") and termites. The culinary creativity even extends to naming: one tasty larva, which is also known under the name \"bamboo worm\" (\"non mai phai\", \"Omphisa fuscidentalis\"), is colloquially called \"express train\" (\"rot duan\") due to its appearance.\n\nMost of the insects taste fairly bland when deep-fried, somewhat like popcorn and prawns. But when deep-fried together with kaffir lime leaves, chilies and garlic, the insects become an excellent snack to go with a drink. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the \"maeng da\" or \"maelong da na\" (\"Lethocerus indicus\") has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very ripe gorgonzola cheese. This giant water bug is famously used in a chili dip called \"nam phrik maeng da\". Ant eggs and silkworms are eaten boiled in a soup in Isan, or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand.\n\nThe quality and choice of street food in Thailand is world-renowned. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best street food cities in the world, and even called the street food capital of the world. The website VirtualTourist says:\"Few places in the world, if any, are as synonymous with street food as Thailand. For the variety of locations and abundance of options, we selected Bangkok, Thailand, as our number one spot for street food. Bangkok is notable for both its variety of offerings and the city's abundance of street hawkers.\"\n\nThere is scarcely a Thai dish that is not sold by a street vendor or at a market somewhere in Thailand. Some specialize in only one or two dishes, others offer a complete menu that rival that of restaurants. Some sell only pre-cooked foods, others make food to order. The foods that are made to order, tend to be dishes that can be quickly prepared: quick stir fries with rice, such as \"phat kaphrao\" (spicy basil-fried minced pork, chicken, or seafood) or \"phat khana\" (stir fried gailan), and quick curries such as \"pladuk phat phet\" (catfish fried with red curry paste).\n\nNoodles are a popular street food item as they are mainly eaten as a single dish. Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles (\"khanom chin\"), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand you will see \"som tam\" (green papaya salad) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken; but if the shop doesn't sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet \"roti\", a thin, flat fried dough envelop, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The \"roti\" is similar to the Malay \"roti canai\" and Singaporean \"roti prata\", and the stalls are often operated by Thai Muslims. Sweets snacks, collectively called \"khanom\", such as \"tako\" (coconut cream jelly), \"khanom man\" (coconut cassava cake), and \"khanom wun\" (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as \"khanom bueang\" and \"khanom khrok\" (somewhat similar to Dutch \"poffertjes\"), are made to order.\n\nIn the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling \"kap klaem\" (\"drinking food\"). Popular \"kap klaem\" dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness. \"Salapao\", steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed \"baozi\", are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.\n\nFood markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.\n\nThe dishes sold at wet markets in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and foam food containers, to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.\n\nAlthough the Vegetarian Festival is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand's population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand. All traditionally made Thai curries, for instance, contain shrimp paste, and fish sauce is used as salt in many Thai dishes. At shops and restaurants that specifically cater for vegetarians, substitutes for these ingredients are used. Meat dishes are also commonly part of the alms offered to Buddhist monks in Thailand as vegetarianism is not considered obligatory in Theravada Buddhism; but having an animal killed specifically to feed Buddhist monks is prohibited.\n\nIn most towns and cities, traditional Buddhist vegetarian fare, without any meat or seafood products of any kind and also excluding certain strong tasting vegetables and spices, is sold at specialized vegetarian restaurants which can be recognized by a yellow sign with in Thai script the word \"che\" () or \"ahan che\" () written on it in red. These restaurants serve what can be regarded as vegan food. Many Indian restaurants of the sizable Thai-Indian community will also have vegetarian dishes on offer, due to the fact that vegetarianism is held as an ideal by many followers of the Hindu faith. Indian vegetarian cuisine can incorporate dairy products and honey. Due to the increased demand for vegetarian food from foreign tourists, many hotels, guesthouses and restaurants that cater to them, will now also have vegetarian versions of Thai dishes on their menu. Pescatarians would have very few problems with Thai cuisine due to the abundance of Thai dishes which only contain fish and seafood as their source of animal protein.\n\nOriginally, thisit referred to the food that was cooked or prepared by people living in the palace. Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the Rattanakosin Era onwards.\n\nTypically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked, should be complex and delicate.\n\nLa Loubère, an envoy from France during the reign of King Narai the Great, recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. Ways that make Thai Royal cuisine different food was the beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.\n\nThere are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as \"ranchuan\" curry, \"nam phrik long rue\", \"matsaman\" curry, rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or \"khao chae\", spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.\n\nThai Chef McDang, himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction. He maintains that the only difference between the food of the palace and that of the common people is the former's elaborate presentation and better ingredients.\n\nThai cuisine only became well-known worldwide from the 1960s on, when Thailand became a destination for international tourism and US troops arrived in large numbers during the Vietnam War. The number of Thai restaurants went up from four in 1970s London to between two and three hundred in less than 25 years. The earliest attested Thai restaurant in the United States, \"Chada Thai\", opened its doors in 1959 in Denver, Colorado. It was run by the former newspaper publisher Lai-iad (Lily) Chittivej. The oldest Thai restaurant in London, \"The Bangkok Restaurant\", was opened in 1967 by Mr and Mrs Bunnag, a former Thai diplomat and his wife, in South Kensington.\n\nThe global popularity of Thai cuisine is seen as an important factor in promoting tourism, and also increased exports of Thailand's agricultural sector. It is a result of deliberate \"gastrodiplomacy\". In June 2009, the Tourism Authority of Thailand organised a conference to discuss these matters at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre in Bangkok. TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said, \"This conference was long overdue. The promotion of Thai cuisine is one of our major niche-market targets. Our figures show that visitors spent 38.8 billion baht on eating and drinking last year, up 16% over 1997.\"\n\nThe Thaksin administration (2001–2006) launched the \"Kitchen of the World\" campaign early in its tenure to promote Thai cuisine internationally, with a yearly budget of 500 million baht. It provided loans and training for restaurateurs seeking to establish Thai restaurants overseas; established the \"Thai Select\" certification program which encouraged the use of ingredients imported from Thailand; and promoted integration between Thai investors, Thai Airways, and the Tourism Authority of Thailand with Thai restaurants overseas.\n\nThe \"Global Thai\" program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously. By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.\n\nThe program was explained in \"Thailand: Kitchen of the World\", an e-book published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: \"In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide.\"\n\nThe Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Commerce offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different \"master restaurant\" types—from fast food to elegant—which investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan. Concomitantly, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants.\n\nOne survey conducted in 2003 by the Kellogg School of Management and Sasin Institute showed that Thai cuisine ranked fourth when people were asked to name an ethnic cuisine, after Italian, French, and Chinese cuisine. When asked \"what is your favourite cuisine?\", Thailand's cuisine came in at sixth place, behind the three aforementioned cuisines, and Indian and Japanese cuisine.\n\nIn the list of the \"World's 50 most delicious foods\", compiled by CNN in 2011, \"som tam\" stands at place 46, \"nam tok mu\" at 19, \"tom yam kung\" at 8, and massaman curry stands on first place as most delicious food in the world. In a reader's poll held a few months later by CNN, \"mu nam tok\" came in at 36, Thai fried rice at 24, green curry at 19, \"massaman\" curry at 10, and Thai \"som tam\", \"pad Thai\", and \"tom yam kung\" at six, five, and four.\n\nIn 2012, the British \"Restaurant Magazine\" included Nahm Bangkok of chef David Thompson in its yearly list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\n\nThai chefs of the Thailand Culinary Academy took second place in the Gourmet Team Challenge (Practical) of the FHC China International Culinary Arts Competition 14 in Shanghai, China on 14–16 November 2012. They won the IKA Culinary Olympic 2012 competition held in Erfurt, Germany between 5–10 October 2012, where they received four gold and one silver medal.\n\nIn 2011, the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef in the Northwestern United States, was presented to Andy Ricker of restaurant \"Pok Pok\" in Portland, Oregon, and for Best Chef in the Southwestern United States to Saipin Chutima of restaurant \"Lotus of Siam\" in Winchester, Nevada.\n\nThree restaurants that specialize in Thai cuisine, but are owned by non-Thai chefs, have received Michelin stars:\n\n\nCulinary tours of Thailand have gained popularity in recent years. Alongside other forms of tourism in Thailand, food tours have carved a niche for themselves. Many companies offer culinary and cooking tours of Thailand and many tourists visiting Thailand attend cooking courses offered by hotels, guesthouses and cooking schools.\n\nThe Thai government believes that a sub-standard Thai restaurant meal served abroad \"...sabotages the country's reputation.\" To ensure the quality of Thai food abroad, the government has over the years initiated a series of programs designed to create universal standards for Thai food.\n\nIn 2003 the Ministry of Finance sent officials to the US to award certificates to deserving restaurants. On their return the project was abandoned.\n\nSoon thereafter, the Ministry of Labor created \"Krua Thai Su Krua Lok\" ('Thai kitchen goes global'). Its centerpiece was a 10-day Thai cooking course for those who wanted to prepare Thai food overseas. The effort was short-lived.\n\nAfter some officials had a bad Thai meal abroad, in 2013 the Yingluck administration had the idea of standardising Thai food everywhere. The National Food Institute came up with a program called \"Rod Thai Tae\" ('authentic Thai taste'). A parallel effort was called the \"Thai Delicious\" project.\n\nThailand's National Innovation Agency (NIA), a public organization under the Thai Ministry of Science and Technology, spearheaded a 30 million baht (US$1 million), effort by the government to:\n\n\nThe agency has posted 11 \"authentic\" recipes for tom yum gung (nam sai), tom yum gung (nam khon), pad Thai, Massaman curry, kaeng kiew wan (green curry), kaeng lueng (southern Thai sour curry), Golek chicken sauce, khao soi, sai oui (northern Thai sausage), nam prik noom (green pepper chili paste), and nam prik aong (northern Thai chili paste). These recipes were featured at a gala dinner promoting \"Authentic Thai Food for the World\", held at the Plaza Athénée Hotel Bangkok on 24 August 2016 at which Thailand's Minister of Industry was the honored guest. By 2020, Thai Delicious plans to post over 300 Thai food recipes.\n\nTo determine authenticity, Thai researchers developed the \"e-delicious machine\", described as \"...an intelligent robot that measures smell and taste in food ingredients through sensor technology in order to measure taste like a food critic.\" The machine evaluates food by measuring its conductivity at different voltages. Readings from 10 sensors are combined to produce a chemical signature. Because the machine cannot judge taste, the food is compared with a standard derived from a database of popular preferences for each dish. For tom yam, the spicy soup flavored with Kaffir lime leaves and coriander, researchers posted notices at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, requesting 120 tasters. The tasters—students, university staff, and area workers—were paid a few baht for their opinions. They were served 10 differently prepared soups and rated each one. The winning soup was declared the standard, and its chemical characteristics were programmed into the machine. When testing food, the machine returns a numerical score from one to 100. A score lower than 80 is deemed \"not up to standard\". The machine cost about US$100,000 to develop. Restaurants that follow officially sanctioned recipes can affix a \"Thai Delicious\" logo to their menus. As each machine sells for 200,000 baht, this project was shelved also.\n\nThe Thai Delicious project has been criticized, the main rationale being that \"Standardisation is the enemy of Thai food.\" Some observers think, however, that the quality of Thai food, at least in the US, is declining with its increased popularity, a state of affairs that Thai Delicious aims to fix.\n\nIn August 2018, Thailand's Ministry of Commerce kicked off a project called \"Thai Select\". It issues certificates in three grades to domestic Thai restaurants: gold (five stars); red (four stars); and orange (three stars). The goal is to enable tourists to Thailand to choose a worthy restaurant.\n\nCulture Minister Vira Rojpojchanarat announced in 2018 that between 2020 and 2024, his ministry will investigate ways to preserve authentic Thai cuisine from the increasing influence of foreign dishes. \"Unique in its preparation with recipes handed down for generations, Thai culinary art needs better protection against foreign influences which are now changing the look and taste of certain local dishes,\" he warned. The plan will conform to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The 2003 convention intends to protect the \"uses, representations, expressions, knowledge and techniques that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, recognised as an integral part of their cultural heritage\".\n\nOn average, Thai people consume 4,300 mg of sodium per day, twice the WHO's recommended maximum. Thai street food is one of the top three contributors to high salt intake. The Public Health Ministry has embarked on a program to reduce the population's salt consumption by 30 percent.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30554", "title": "Tychonoff space", "text": "Tychonoff space\n\nIn topology and related branches of mathematics, Tychonoff spaces and completely regular spaces are kinds of topological spaces. These conditions are examples of separation axioms.\n\nTychonoff spaces are named after Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff, whose Russian name (Тихонов) is variously rendered as \"Tychonov\", \"Tikhonov\", \"Tihonov\", \"Tichonov\" etc.\n\nA topological space, formula_1, is called \"completely regular\" exactly in case points can be separated from closed sets via (bounded) continuous real-valued functions. In technical terms this means: for any closed set formula_2 and any point formula_3, then there exists a real-valued continuous function formula_4 such that formula_5 and formula_6. (Equivalently one can choose any two values instead of formula_7 and formula_8 and even demand that formula_9 be a bounded function.)\n\nA topological space, formula_1, is furthermore called a \"Tychonoff space\" (alternatively: \"T space\", or \"T space\", or \"completely T space\") in case it is a completely regular Hausdorff space.\n\nRemark. Completely regular spaces and Tychonoff spaces are related through the notion of Kolmogorov equivalence. A topological space is Tychonoff if and only if it's both completely regular and T. On the other hand, a space is completely regular if and only if its Kolmogorov quotient is Tychonoff.\n\nAcross mathematical literature different conventions are applied when it comes to the term \"completely regular\" and the \"T\"-Axioms. The definitions in this section are in typical modern usage. Some authors, however, switch the meanings of the two kinds of terms, or use all terms interchangeably. In Wikipedia, the terms \"completely regular\" and \"Tychonoff\" are used freely and the \"T\"-notation is generally avoided. In standard literature, caution is thus advised, to find out which definitions the author is using. For more on this issue, see History of the separation axioms.\n\nAlmost every topological space studied in mathematical analysis is Tychonoff, or at least completely regular.\nFor example, the real line is Tychonoff under the standard Euclidean topology.\nOther examples include:\n\n\nComplete regularity and the Tychonoff property are well-behaved with respect to initial topologies. Specifically, complete regularity is preserved by taking arbitrary initial topologies and the Tychonoff property is preserved by taking point-separating initial topologies. It follows that:\n\nLike all separation axioms, complete regularity is not preserved by taking final topologies. In particular, quotients of completely regular spaces need not be regular. Quotients of Tychonoff spaces need not even be Hausdorff. There are closed quotients of the Moore plane which provide counterexamples.\n\nFor any topological space \"X\", let \"C\"(\"X\") denote the family of real-valued continuous functions on \"X\" and let \"C\"(\"X\") be the subset of bounded real-valued continuous functions.\n\nCompletely regular spaces can be characterized by the fact that their topology is completely determined by \"C\"(\"X\") or \"C\"(\"X\"). In particular:\n\n\nGiven an arbitrary topological space (\"X\", τ) there is a universal way of associating a completely regular space with (\"X\", τ). Let ρ be the initial topology on \"X\" induced by \"C\"(\"X\") or, equivalently, the topology generated by the basis of cozero sets in (\"X\", τ). Then ρ will be the finest completely regular topology on \"X\" which is coarser than τ. This construction is universal in the sense that any continuous function\nto a completely regular space \"Y\" will be continuous on (\"X\", ρ). In the language of category theory, the functor which sends (\"X\", τ) to (\"X\", ρ) is left adjoint to the inclusion functor CReg → Top. Thus the category of completely regular spaces CReg is a reflective subcategory of Top, the category of topological spaces. By taking Kolmogorov quotients, one sees that the subcategory of Tychonoff spaces is also reflective.\n\nOne can show that \"C\"(\"X\") = \"C\"(\"X\") in the above construction so that the rings \"C\"(\"X\") and \"C\"(\"X\") are typically only studied for completely regular spaces \"X\".\n\nThe category of real compact Tychonoff spaces is anti-equivalent to the category of the rings \"C\"(\"X\") (where \"X\" is real compact) together with ring homomorphisms as maps. For example one can reconstruct \"X\" from \"C\"(\"X\") when \"X\" is (real) compact. The algebraic theory of these rings is therefore subject of intensive studies. \nA vast generalisation of this class of rings which still resembles many properties of Tychonoff spaces but is also applicable in real algebraic geometry, is the class of real closed rings.\n\nTychonoff spaces are precisely those spaces which can be\nembedded in compact Hausdorff spaces. More precisely, for every Tychonoff space \"X\", there exists a compact Hausdorff space \"K\" such that \"X\" is homeomorphic to a subspace of \"K\".\n\nIn fact, one can always choose \"K\" to be a Tychonoff cube (i.e. a possibly infinite product of unit intervals). Every Tychonoff cube is compact Hausdorff as a consequence of Tychonoff's theorem. Since every subspace of a compact Hausdorff space is Tychonoff one has:\n\nOf particular interest are those embeddings where the image of \"X\" is dense in \"K\"; these are called Hausdorff compactifications of \"X\". Given any embedding of a Tychonoff space \"X\" in a compact Hausdorff space \"K\" the closure of the image of \"X\" in \"K\" is a compactification of \"X\".\n\nAmong those Hausdorff compactifications, there is a unique \"most general\" one, the Stone–Čech compactification β\"X\".\nIt is characterised by the universal property that, given a continuous map \"f\" from \"X\" to any other compact Hausdorff space \"Y\", there is a unique continuous map \"g\" from β\"X\" to \"Y\" that extends \"f\" in the sense that \"f\" is the composition of \"g\" and \"j\".\n\nComplete regularity is exactly the condition necessary for the existence of uniform structures on a topological space. In other words, every uniform space has a completely regular topology and every completely regular space \"X\" is uniformizable. A topological space admits a separated uniform structure if and only if it is Tychonoff.\n\nGiven a completely regular space \"X\" there is usually more than one uniformity on \"X\" that is compatible with the topology of \"X\". However, there will always be a finest compatible uniformity, called the fine uniformity on \"X\". If \"X\" is Tychonoff, then the uniform structure can be chosen so that β\"X\" becomes the completion of the uniform space \"X\".\n\n"}
{"id": "30667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30667", "title": "Last Supper", "text": "Last Supper\n\nThe Last Supper is the final meal that, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus shared with his Apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, also known as \"Holy Communion\" or \"The Lord's Supper\".\n\nThe First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper. The four canonical Gospels all state that the Last Supper took place towards the end of the week, after Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem and that Jesus and his Apostles shared a meal shortly before Jesus was crucified at the end of that week. During the meal Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the Apostles present, and foretells that before the next morning, Peter will deny knowing him.\n\nThe three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to the Apostles, saying \"This is my body given to you\" (though the apostles are not explicitly mentioned in the account in First Corinthians). The Gospel of John does not include this episode, but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles, giving the new commandment \"to love one another as I have loved you\", and has a detailed farewell discourse by Jesus, calling the Apostles who follow his teachings \"friends and not servants\", as he prepares them for his departure.\n\nScholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharist traditions. Others see the account of the Last Supper as derived from 1st-century eucharistic practice as described by Paul in the mid-50s.\n\nThe term \"Last Supper\" does not appear in the New Testament, but traditionally many Christians refer so to the event. Many Protestants use the term \"Lord's Supper\", stating that the term \"last\" suggests this was one of several meals and not \"the\" meal. The term \"Lord's Supper\" refers both to the biblical event and the act of \"Holy Communion\" and Eucharistic (\"thanksgiving\") celebration within their liturgy. Evangelical Protestants also use the term \"Lord's Supper\", but most do not use the terms \"Eucharist\" or the word \"Holy\" with the name \"Communion\".\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox use the term \"Mystical Supper\" which refers both to the biblical event and the act of Eucharistic celebration within liturgy. The Russian Orthodox also use the term \"Secret Supper\" (, \"Taynaya vecherya\").\n\nThe last meal that Jesus shared with his disciples is described in all four canonical Gospels (, , and ). This meal later became known as the Last Supper. The Last Supper was likely a retelling of the events of the last meal of Jesus among the early Christian community, and became a ritual which recounted that meal.\n\nPaul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, which was likely written before the Gospels, includes a reference to the Last Supper but emphasizes the theological basis rather than giving a detailed description of the event or its background.\n\nThe overall narrative that is shared in all Gospel accounts that leads to the Last Supper is that after the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem early in the week, and encounters with various people and the Jewish elders, Jesus and his disciples share a meal towards the end of the week. After the meal, Jesus is betrayed, arrested, tried, and then crucified.\n\nKey events in the meal are the preparation of the disciples for the departure of Jesus, the predictions about the impending betrayal of Jesus, and the foretelling of the upcoming denial of Jesus by Apostle Peter.\n\nIn , , and during the meal, Jesus predicted that one of his Apostles would betray him. Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present, and saying that there would be \"woe to the man who betrays the Son of man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\"\n\nIn and , Judas is specifically identified as the traitor. In the Gospel of John, when asked about the traitor, Jesus states:\nThe three Synoptic Gospel accounts give somewhat different versions of the order of the meal. In chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus prays thanks for the bread, divides it, and hands the pieces of bread to his disciples, saying \"Take, eat, this is my body.\" Later in the meal Jesus takes a cup of wine, offers another prayer, and gives it to those present, saying \"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.\"\n\nIn chapter 22 of the Gospel of Luke, however, the wine is blessed and distributed before the bread, followed by the bread, then by a second, larger cup of wine, as well as somewhat different wordings. Additionally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples \"do this in remembrance of me.\" This event has been regarded by Christians of most denominations as the institution of the Eucharist. There is recorded celebration of the Eucharist by the early Christian community in Jerusalem.\n\nThe institution of the Eucharist is recorded in the three Synoptic Gospels and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. As noted above, Jesus's words differ slightly in each account. In addition, is a disputed text which does not appear in some of the early manuscripts of Luke. Some scholars, therefore, believe that it is an interpolation, while others have argued that it is original.\n\nA comparison of the accounts given in the Gospels and 1 Corinthians is shown in the table below, with text from the ASV. The disputed text from Luke 22:19b–20 is in \"italics\".\n\nJesus' actions in sharing the bread and wine have been linked with which refers to a blood sacrifice that, as recounted in , Moses offered in order to seal a covenant with God. Some scholars interpret the description of Jesus' action as asking his disciples to consider themselves part of a sacrifice, where Jesus is the one due to physically undergo it.\n\nAlthough the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread and wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a Eucharistic nature and resonates with the \"words of institution\" used in the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.\n\nIn , , and Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter will disown him three times before the rooster crows the next morning. The three Synoptic Gospels mention that after the arrest of Jesus, Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him. Peter then began to cry bitterly.\n\nIn John, Jesus's last supper is not explicitly referred to as a Passover meal. Furthermore, John's recounting of events has the crucifixion taking place concurrently with the evening Passover meal. Recent scholarship suggests that John's chronological peculiarity is a result of his use of a more modern calendar than the one that would have been in use when Jesus was alive years earlier. As a result, the evidence dates the Last Supper to the same evening as the start of Passover, with the crucifixion taking place two days later. John therefore stands alone in its sequencing, which contradicts not only the uniform chronology expressed in the Synoptics but also the recent scholarship, the conclusions of which are supported by historical astronomical data.\n\nIn the Gospel of John, after the departure of Judas from the Last Supper, Jesus tells his remaining disciples that he will be with them for only a short time, then gives them a New Commandment, stating: “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” in . Two similar statements also appear later in : \"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you\", and : \"This is my command: Love each other.\"\n\nAt the Last Supper in the Gospel of John, Jesus gives an extended sermon to his disciples. This discourse resembles farewell speeches called testaments, in which a father or religious leader, often on the deathbed, leaves instructions for his children or followers.\n\nThis sermon is referred to as the Farewell discourse of Jesus, and has historically been considered a source of Christian doctrine, particularly on the subject of Christology. is generally known as the \"Farewell Prayer\" or the \"High Priestly Prayer\", given that it is an intercession for the coming Church. The prayer begins with Jesus's petition for his glorification by the Father, given that completion of his work and continues to an intercession for the success of the works of his disciples and the community of his followers.\n\nHistorians estimate that the date of the crucifixion fell in the range AD 30–36. Physicists such as Isaac Newton and Colin Humphreys have ruled out the years 31, 32, 35, and 36 on astronomical grounds, leaving 7 April AD 30 and 3 April AD 33 as possible crucifixion dates. Humphreys proposes narrowing down the date of the Last Supper as having occurred in the evening of Wednesday, 1 April AD 33, by revising Annie Jaubert's double-Passover theory. The rationale is as follows.\n\nAll Gospels agree that Jesus held a Last Supper with his disciples prior to dying on a Friday at or just before the time of Passover (annually on 15 Nisan, the official Jewish day beginning at sunset) and that his body was left in the tomb for the whole of the next day, which was a Shabbat (Saturday). However, while the Synoptic Gospels present the Last Supper as a Passover meal, the Gospel of John makes no explicit mention that the Last Supper was a Passover meal and presents the official Jewish Passover feast as beginning in the evening a few hours \"after\" the death of Jesus. John thus implies that the Friday of the crucifixion was the day of preparation for the feast (14 Nisan), not the feast itself (15 Nisan), and astronomical calculations of ancient Passover dates initiated by Isaac Newton, and posthumously published in 1733, support John's chronology.\n\nHistorically, various attempts to reconcile the three synoptic accounts with John have been made, some of which are indicated in the article on the Last Supper by Francis Mershman in the 1912 Catholic Encyclopedia. The Maundy Thursday church tradition assumes that the Last Supper was held on the evening before the crucifixion day (although, strictly speaking, in no Gospel is it unequivocally said that this meal took place on the night before Jesus died).\n\nA new approach to resolve this contrast was undertaken in the wake of the excavations at Qumran in the 1950s when Annie Jaubert argued that there were two Passover feast dates: while the official Jewish lunar calendar had Passover begin on a Friday evening in the year that Jesus died, a solar calendar was also used, for instance by the Essene community at Qumran, which always had the Passover feast begin on a Tuesday evening. According to Jaubert, Jesus would have celebrated the Passover on Tuesday, and the Jewish authorities three days later, on Friday.\n\nHowever, Humphreys has calculated that Jaubert's proposal cannot be correct, as the Qumran solar Passover would always fall \"after\" the official Jewish lunar Passover. Nevertheless, he agrees with the approach of two Passover dates, and argues that the Last Supper took place on the evening of Wednesday 1 April 33, based on his recent discovery of the Essene, Samaritan, and Zealot \"lunar\" calendar, which is based on Egyptian reckoning. Humphreys' implication is that Jesus and other communities were following the original Hebrew calendar putatively imported from Egypt by Moses (which requires calculating the time of the invisible new moon), rather than the official Jewish calendar which had been adopted more recently, in the 6th century BC during the Babylonian exile (which simply requires observing the visible waxing moon). A Last Supper on Wednesday, he argues, would allow more time than in the traditional view (Last Supper on Thursday) for the various interrogations of Jesus and his presentation to Pilate before he was crucified on Friday. Furthermore, a Wednesday Last Supper, followed by a Thursday daylight Sanhedrin trial, followed by a Friday judicial confirmation and crucifixion would not require violating Jewish court procedure as documented in the 2nd century, which forbade capital trials at night and moreover required a confirmatory session the following day.\n\nIn a review of Humphreys' book, the Bible scholar William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which \"does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.\"\n\nAccording to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is today called The Room of the Last Supper on Mount Zion, just outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem, and is traditionally known as The Upper Room. This is based on the account in the Synoptic Gospels that states that Jesus had instructed two disciples (Luke 22:8 specifies that Jesus sent Peter and John) to go to \"the city\" to meet \"a man carrying a jar of water\", who would lead them to a house, where they would find \"a large upper room furnished and ready\". In this upper room they \"prepare the Passover\".\n\nNo more specific indication of the location is given in the New Testament, and the \"city\" referred to may be a suburb of Jerusalem, such as Bethany, rather than Jerusalem itself. The traditional location is in an area that, according to archaeology, had a large Essene community, a point made by scholars who suspect a link between Jesus and the group (Kilgallen 265).\n\nSaint Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem is another possible site for the room in which the Last Supper was held, and contains a Christian stone inscription testifying to early reverence for that spot. Certainly the room they have is older than that of the current coenaculum (crusader – 12th century) and as the room is now underground the relative altitude is correct (the streets of 1st century Jerusalem were at least lower than those of today, so any true building of that time would have even its upper story currently under the earth). They also have a revered Icon of the Virgin Mary, reputedly painted from life by St Luke.\n\nBargil Pixner claims the original site is located beneath the current structure of the Cenacle on Mount Zion.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas viewed The Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit as teachers and masters who provide lessons, at times by example. For Aquinas, the Last Supper and the Cross form the summit of the teaching that wisdom flows from intrinsic grace, rather than external power. For Aquinas, at the Last Supper Christ taught by example, showing the value of humility (as reflected in John's foot washing narrative) and self-sacrifice, rather than by exhibiting external, miraculous powers.\n\nAquinas stated that based on (in the Farewell discourse) in which Jesus said: \"No longer do I call you servants; ...but I have called you friends\". Those who are followers of Christ and partake in the Sacrament of the Eucharist become his friends, as those gathered at the table of the Last Supper. For Aquinas, at the Last Supper Christ made the promise to be present in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and to be with those who partake in it, as he was with his disciples at the Last Supper.\n\nJohn Calvin believed only in the two sacraments of Baptism and the \"Lord's Supper\" (i.e., Eucharist). Thus, his analysis of the Gospel accounts of the Last Supper was an important part of his entire theology. Calvin related the Synoptic Gospel accounts of the Last Supper with the Bread of Life Discourse in that states: \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry.\"\n\nCalvin also believed that the acts of Jesus at the Last Supper should be followed as an example, stating that just as Jesus gave thanks to the Father before breaking the bread, those who go to the \"Lord's Table\" to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist must give thanks for the \"boundless love of God\" and celebrate the sacrament with both joy and thanksgiving.\n\nThe institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is remembered by Roman Catholics as one of the Luminous Mysteries of the Rosary, the First Station of a so-called New Way of the Cross and by Christians as the \"inauguration of the New Covenant\", mentioned by the prophet Jeremiah, fulfilled at the last supper when Jesus \"took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, 'Take; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, 'This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Other Christian groups consider the Bread and Wine remembrance to be a change to the Passover ceremony, as Jesus Christ has become \"our Passover, sacrificed for us\", and hold that partaking of the Passover Communion (or fellowship) is now the sign of the New Covenant, when properly understood by the practicing believer.\n\nThese meals evolved into more formal worship services and became codified as the Mass in the Catholic Church, and as the Divine Liturgy in the Eastern Orthodox Church; at these liturgies, Catholics and Eastern Orthodox celebrate the Sacrament of the Eucharist. The name \"Eucharist\" is from the Greek word \"εὐχαριστία\" (eucharistia) which means \"thanksgiving\".\n\nEarly Christianity observed a ritual meal known as the \"agape feast\" These \"love feasts\" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the Lord's Day, to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, the appearance to Thomas and the Pentecost which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.\n\nAmong Christian denominations, the Eastern Orthodox Church holds that this Eucharistic meal was not the Passover Seder, but a separate meal. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) documents also specifically reject the Seder arguments and state that given that no Jewish Seder texts exist earlier than the 9th century, it is historically implausible to attempt a reconstruction of the Seder to create a parallel to the Last Supper, and that the Gospel accounts clearly indicate that the purpose of the Last Supper was not the annual repetition of the Exodus.\n\nThe fifth chapter in Quran, \"Al-Ma'ida\" (the table) contains a reference to a meal (Sura 5:114) with a table sent down from God to ʿĪsá (i.e., Jesus) and the apostles (Hawariyyin). However, there is nothing in Sura 5:114 to indicate that Jesus was celebrating that meal regarding his impending death, especially as the Qur'an insists that Jesus was never crucified to begin with. Thus, although Sura 5:114 refers to \"a meal\", there is no indication that it is the Last Supper. However, some scholars believe that Jesus' manner of speech during which the table was sent down suggests that it was an affirmation of the apostles' resolves and to strengthen their faiths as the impending trial was about to befall them.\n\nSome Jesus Seminar scholars consider the Lord's supper to have derived not from Jesus' last supper with the disciples but rather from the gentile tradition of memorial dinners for the dead. In this view, the Last Supper is a tradition associated mainly with the gentile churches that Paul established, rather than with the earlier, Jewish congregations.\n\nProminent New Testament Scholar E.P. Sanders states in his book \"The Historical Figure of Jesus\" that Jesus having a final meal with his disciples is almost beyond dispute, and belongs to the framework of the narrative of Jesus's life.\n\nLuke is the only Gospel in which Jesus tells his disciples to repeat the ritual of bread and wine. Bart D. Ehrman states that these particular lines do not appear in certain ancient manuscripts and might not be original to the text. However, it is in the earliest Greek manuscripts, e.g. P75, Sinaticus, Vaticanus and Ephraemi Rescriptus.\n\nHowever, many early Church Fathers have attested to the belief that at the Last Supper, Christ made the promise to be present in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, with attestations dating back to the first century AD. The teaching was also affirmed by many councils throughout the Church's history.\n\nThe Last Supper has been a popular subject in Christian art. Such depictions date back to early Christianity and can be seen in the Catacombs of Rome. Byzantine artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal. By the Renaissance, the Last Supper was a favorite topic in Italian art.\n\nThere are three major themes in the depictions of the Last Supper: the first is the dramatic and dynamic depiction of Jesus's announcement of his betrayal. The second is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the Eucharist. The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical. The third major theme is the farewell of Jesus to his disciples, in which Judas Iscariot is no longer present, having left the supper. The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure. There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.\n\nWell known examples include Leonardo da Vinci's depiction, which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art due to its high level of harmony, Tintoretto's depiction which is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table and Salvadore Dali's depiction combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of Surrealism.\n\nThe Lutheran Passion hymn \"Da der Herr Christ zu Tische saß\" (When the Lord Christ sat at the table) derives from a depiction of the Last Supper.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30845", "title": "Tiramisu", "text": "Tiramisu\n\nTiramisu (from the Italian language, spelled \"tiramisù\" , meaning \"pick me up\" or \"cheer me up\") is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Its origins are often disputed among Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.\n\nMost accounts of the origin of tiramisu date its invention to the 1960s in the region of Veneto, Italy, at the restaurant \"Le Beccherie\" in Treviso.\nSpecifically, the dish is claimed to have first been created by a confectioner named Roberto Linguanotto, owner of \"Le Beccherie\".\nSome debate remains, however. Historical records state that Tiramisu has aphrodisiac effects and was served in brothels in Treviso. Accounts by Carminantonio Iannaccone (as first reported by David Rosengarten in \"The Rosengarten Report\" and followed by \"The Baltimore Sun\" and \"The Washington Post\") claim the tiramisu sold at Le Beccherie was made by him in his bakery, created by him on 24 December 1969. Other sources report the creation of the cake as originating towards the end of the 17th century in Siena in honour of Grand Duke Cosimo III.\nRegardless, recipes named \"tiramisu\" are unknown in cookbooks before the 1960s. The Italian-language dictionary \"Sabatini Coletti\" traces the first printed mention of the word to 1980, while Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary gives 1982 as the first mention of the dessert.\n\nThere is also evidence of a \"Tiremesù\" semi-frozen dessert served by the Vetturino restaurant in Pieris, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia, since 1938. This may be the name's origin, while the recipe for Tiramisu may have originated as a variation of another layered dessert, \"Zuppa Inglese\".\n\nIt is mentioned in Giovanni Capnist's 1983 cookbook \"I Dolci del Veneto\". Among traditional pastry, tiramisu also has similarities with many other cakes, in particular with the Charlotte, in some versions composed of a Bavarian cream surrounded by a crown of ladyfingers and covered by a sweet cream; the Turin cake (\"dolce Torino\"), consisting of ladyfingers soaked in rosolio and alchermes with a spread made of butter, egg yolks, sugar, milk, and dark chocolate; and the \"Bavarese Lombarda\", which is similar in the preparation and the presence of certain ingredients such as ladyfingers and egg yolks (albeit cooked ones). In \"Bavarese\", butter and rosolio (or alchermes) are also used, but not mascarpone cream nor coffee.\n\nOn July 29, 2017, Tiramisu was entered by the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies on the list of traditional Friulian and Giulian agri-food products in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region.\n\nTraditional tiramisu contains a short list of ingredients: finger biscuits, egg yolks, sugar, coffee, mascarpone cheese and cocoa powder.\n\nThe original shape of the cake is round, although the shape of the biscuits favors the use of a rectangular or square pan, spreading the classic image \"to tile\". However, it is also often assembled in round glasses, which show the various layers, or pyramid. Modern versions have as a rule the addition of whipped cream or whipped egg, or both, combined with mascarpone cream. This makes the dish lighter, thick and foamy. Among the most common alcoholic changes includes the addition of Marsala. The cake is usually eaten cold.\n\nAnother variation involves the preparation of the cream with eggs heated to sterilize it, but not so much that the eggs scramble.\nOver time, replacing some of the ingredients, mainly coffee, there arose numerous variants such as tiramisu with chocolate, amaretto, berry, lemon, strawberry, pineapple, yogurt, banana, raspberry, coconut, and even beer (biramisu). Although these are not considered true Tiramisu as these variations only share the layered characteristic of Tiramisu; these examples more closely resemble variations of trifle.\n\nNumerous variations of Tiramisu exist. Some cooks use other cakes or sweet, yeasted breads, such as \"panettone\", in place of ladyfingers. Other cheese mixtures are used as well, some containing raw eggs, and others containing no eggs at all. Marsala wine can be added to the recipe, but other liquors are frequently substituted for it in both the coffee and the cheese mixture, including dark rum, Madeira, port, brandy, Malibu, or Irish cream and especially coffee-flavoured liqueurs such as Tia Maria and Kahlúa. Disaronno is also often used to enhance the taste of tiramisu.\n"}
{"id": "30916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30916", "title": "Tomato sauce", "text": "Tomato sauce\n\nTomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, or salsa di pomodoro in Italian) can refer to a large number of different sauces made primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish, rather than as a condiment. Tomato sauces are common for meat and vegetables, but they are perhaps best known as bases for Mexican salsas or sauces for pasta dishes. Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high water content, soft flesh which breaks down easily, and the right composition to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of thickeners such as roux). All of these qualities make them ideal for simple and appealing sauces.\n\nIn countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, the term \"tomato sauce\" is used to describe a condiment similar to ketchup. In some of these countries, both terms are used for the condiment.\n\nThe use of tomato sauce with pasta appears for the first time in 1790 in the Italian cookbook \"L'Apicio moderno\", by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi.\n\nThe simplest tomato sauce consists just of chopped tomatoes cooked down (possibly with olive oil) and simmered until it loses its raw flavor. Of course, it may be seasoned with salt, or other herbs or spices. Optionally, tomato skins may be scalded and peeled according to texture (especially thicker \"pelati\" paste varieties) and tomato seeds may be removed for aesthetic purposes, leaving just the tomato flesh and pulp.\n\nJust like tomato puree or tomato paste, tomato sauce may be one of the ingredients in other dishes, like a tomato-based soup. The sauce is thinner than either the puree, or the paste (which is the thickest), and it may have additional flavors.\n\nWater (or another, more flavorful, liquid, such as stock or wine) is sometimes added to keep it from drying out too much. Onion and garlic are almost always sweated or sautéed at the beginning before the tomato is added, or puréed together with tomatoes and then cooked together. Other seasonings typically include dried mild chili peppers (such as guajillo chili or pasilla chili), epazote, basil, oregano, parsley, and black pepper. Ground or chopped meat is also common.\n\nTomato sauce was an ancient condiment in Mesoamerican food. The first western person to write of what may have been a tomato sauce was Bernardino de Sahagún, a Franciscan friar, who made note of a prepared sauce that was offered for sale in the markets of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City today). Of this he wrote (translated from Spanish), Spaniards later brought the use of tomatoes to Europe.\n\nBasic Mexican tomato sauce (salsa de tomate rojo o jitomate) was traditionally prepared with a molcajete to puree the tomatoes. Food that is cooked in tomato sauce is known as entomatada. Tomato sauce is also stock for spicy sauces and moles.\n\nThe misconception that the tomato has been central to Italian cuisine since its introduction from the Americas is often repeated. Though the tomato was introduced from the Spanish New World to European botanists in the 16th century, tomato sauce made a relatively late entry in Italian cuisine: in Antonio Latini's cookbook \"Lo scalco alla moderna\" (Naples, 1692).\n\nLatini was chef to the Spanish viceroy of Naples, and one of his tomato recipes is for sauce \"alla spagnuola\", \"in the Spanish style\". The first known use of tomato sauce with pasta appears in the Italian cookbook \"L'Apicio moderno\", by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi, edited in 1790.\n\nItalian varieties of tomato sauce range from the very simple pasta al pomodoro to the piquant puttanesca and arrabbiata sauces. Tomato sauce with pasta can stand on its own or it can also be paired with ingredients such as Italian sausage, clams, bacon cubes, tuna, meatballs or vegetables, for a more lively pasta dish.\n\nTomato-garlic sauce is prepared using tomatoes as a main ingredient, and is used in various cuisines and dishes. In Italian cuisine, \"alla pizzaiola\" refers to tomato-garlic sauce, which is used on pizza, pasta and meats.\n\nSauce tomate is one of the five mother sauces of classical French cooking, as codified by Auguste Escoffier in the early 20th century. It consists of salt belly of pork, onions, bay leaves, thyme, tomato purée or fresh tomatoes, roux, garlic, salt, sugar, and pepper. Many times, butter and flour will be listed in the ingredients, but those are only used to make the roux (thickening agent).\n\nThe most common use of the term tomato sauce in New Zealand and South Africa is to describe a popular, commercially produced condiment that is a type of table sauce, similar to American ketchup but without vinegar, which is typically applied to foods such as meat pies, sausages, other cooked meat (in particular steak), and fish and chips. Tomato-based sauces served with pasta would commonly be referred to as \"pasta sauce\" or \"Napoletana sauce\".\n\nThe meaning of the term \"tomato sauce\" depends on the context; on a restaurant menu the phrase \"in a tomato sauce\" means a freshly prepared tomato based sauce as used on pasta, and colloquially it may refer to either the pasta sauce, or American ketchup.\n\nIn Australia \"tomato sauce\" generally refers to the same style of Table Sauce as American ketchup but varies in mixture and doesn't contain onions. Some sources claim that Australian tomato sauce has less tomato than ketchup, but this varies between brands and is not a universal feature. Australian tomato sauce is used in the same way as American ketchup. \n\"Tomato sauce\" may also be used in its generic English meaning of a sauce primarily based on tomatoes, as in a menu item \"Gnocchi in a tomato sauce\" where it would be understood that the sauce would be of the kind used in Italian cooking for pastas.\n\nIn the U.S., \"tomato sauce\" refers to two distinct sauces. One is a tomato concentrate with salt and minimal herbs, used in cooking. This product is considered incomplete and not normally used as is. Related ingredients are tomato purée and tomato paste, each of which is similar but of a thicker consistency. Tomato purée and tomato paste have FDA standards of identity (since 1939) for percentage of tomato solids, and generally do not contain seasonings other than salt; tomato sauce is nonstandardized.\n\nThe second use of the term \"tomato sauce\" in the U.S. is for a cooked sauce of tomatoes, usually containing olive oil and garlic. This type of tomato sauce is generally served with pasta, and sometimes with meat. Less commonly, it is served with chicken or beef alone. One popular variety of tomato sauce is \"marinara sauce, \"an Italian-American term for a simple tomato sauce with herbs—mostly parsley and basil.\n\nContrary to what the name might suggest ('marinara' is Italian for \"sailor-style\") it is without seafood. In Italy, marinara refers either to sauces made with tomato and garlic (as in pizza marinara) or to seafood-based sauces or foods; in this case, the name does not imply that tomato is either included or excluded.\n\nSome Italian Americans on the East Coast and around the Chicago area refer to tomato sauce as \"gravy\", \"tomato gravy\", or \"Sunday gravy\", especially sauces with a large quantity of meat simmered in them, similar to the Italian Neapolitan ragù. The term \"Sunday gravy\" derives from the Italian tradition of having a large, family dinner on Sunday afternoons. \"Gravy\" is an erroneous English translation from the Italian \"sugo\" which means juice, but can also mean sauce (as in \"sugo per pastasciutta\").\n\nThe expression for \"gravy\" in Italian is \"sugo d'arrosto\", which is literally \"juice of a roast\" and is not specifically tomato sauce. Sicilian Americans in communities like Buffalo and Rochester, New York use the terms \"\"sarsa\"\" and \"\"succu\"\" interchangeably for tomato sauces of all types used with pasta, and \"gravy\" only in reference to brown meat gravies. The Italian-American community of New Orleans, however, is largely Sicilian in origin and takes great pride in its Creole-Italian cuisine largely based on what is known locally as \"red gravy\" (tomato sauce).\n\nAmerican supermarkets commonly carry a variety of prepared tomato sauces described as \"spaghetti sauce\" or \"pasta sauce.\" Common variations include meat sauce, marinara sauce, and sauces with mushrooms or sweet red peppers.\n\nA spicy tomato sauce known as \"sauce piquante\" is common in Louisiana Cajun cuisine, that can contain any seafood, poultry, or meats such as wild game. It is typically served over white rice. In Louisiana Creole cuisine, there is a tomato sauce known as a Creole sauce. It is similar to Italian tomato sauce, but features more Louisiana flavors derived from the fusion of French and Spanish cooking styles. They both usually contain the traditional holy trinity of diced bell pepper, onion, and celery.\n\n\"Tomato gravy\" is distinct from the term as used by Italian Americans when referring to a type of tomato sauce particularly where tomatoes were a staple food. The cooked tomatoes, some fat (usually cured pork fat) and flour are cooked together until thick, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Onions or bell peppers may be added as well. Typically, tomato gravy is served over pasta. It is also eaten largely by Creole people in the Southern United States, who eat it over rice.\n\nSome Indian curries have a tomato based sauce, many vegetarian style dishes.\n\n"}

These spoons have heads more or less oval in shape. Teaspoons are a common part of a place setting.\n\nTeaspoons with longer handles, such as iced tea spoons, are commonly used also for ice cream desserts or floats. Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for use with the small type of coffee cup. Another teaspoon, called an \"orange spoon\" (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.\n\nA container designed to hold extra teaspoons, called a \"spooner\", usually in a set with a covered sugar container, formed a part of Victorian table service.\n\nThe teaspoon is first mentioned in an advertisement in a 1686 edition of the \"London Gazette\".\n\nIn some countries, a teaspoon (occasionally \"teaspoonful\") is a unit of volume, especially widely used in cooking recipes and pharmaceutic prescriptions. In English it is abbreviated as \"tsp.\" or, less often, as \"t.\", \"ts.\", or \"tspn.\" The abbreviation is never capitalized because a capital letter is customarily reserved for the larger tablespoon (\"Tbsp.\", \"T.\", \"Tbls.\", or \"Tb.\")\n\nThe metric teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure is 5 mL, equal to 5 cm; that is, UK/Canadian metric tablespoon, or Australian metric tablespoon.\n\nAs a unit of culinary measure, one teaspoon in the United States is tablespoon, that is, exactly 4.92892159375 mL; it is exactly 1 US fluid drams, US fl oz, US cup, and US liquid gallon and or 0.30078125 cubic inches. \n\nFor nutritional labeling and medicine in the US, the teaspoon is defined the same as a metric teaspoon - precisely 5 milliliters (mL)\n\nFor dry ingredients, if a recipe calls for a \"level\" teaspoon of a (salt, flour, etc.), this refers to an approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. A \"rounded\" teaspoon is a larger but less precise measure, produced without leveling the ingredient off or heaping it as high as possible. A \"heaping\" or \"heaped\" teaspoon is a larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the dry ingredient up without leveling it off. For some ingredients, e.g. flour, this quantity can vary considerably.\n\nAs an unofficial but once widely used unit of Apothecaries' measure, the teaspoon is equal to 1 fluid dram (or drachm) and thus of a tablespoon or of a fluid ounce. The Apothecaries' teaspoon (formerly \"tea spoon\" or \"tea-spoon\") was formally known by the Latin \"cochleare minus\", abbreviated \"cochl. min.\" to distinguish it from the tablespoon or \"cochleare majus\" (\"cochl. maj.\").\n\nWhen tea-drinking was first introduced to England circa 1660, tea was rare and expensive, as a consequence of which teacups and teaspoons were smaller than today. This situation persisted until about 1710, when the East India Company began importing tea directly from China. As the price of tea declined, the size of teacups and teaspoons increased. By the 1730s, the teaspoon as a unit of culinary measure had increased to of a tablespoon, but the apothecary unit of measure remained the same. Nevertheless, the teaspoon, usually under its Latin name, continued to be used in Apothecaries' measures for several more decades, with the original definition of one fluid dram.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31149", "title": "Twiglets", "text": "Twiglets\n\nTwiglets are a wheat-based snack with a \"distinctive knobbly shape\" similar to that of a small twig. The taste of Twiglets derives from the yeast extract used in its coating, and has been compared to that of Marmite. They are marketed in the United Kingdom and packaged in 24 g, 45 g, 105 g and 150 g bags, and in 200 g tubs.\n\nTwiglets were invented in 1929 by a French biscuit maker named J. Rondalin, a technical manager at Peek Freans' Bermondsey factory, who added brewer's yeast to a leftover batch of Vitawheat dough. They were first launched onto the consumer market in 1932 by Peek Freans. Today, Twiglets are manufactured in Aintree by United Biscuits subsidiary Jacob's.\n\nDuring the Christmas season, Twiglets were traditionally sold in drum shaped tin boxes as a high class cocktail accompaniment from the 1930s until the 1970s. In modern times, the tin boxes have been substituted with large cardboard tubes decorated with seasonal themes. \n\nIn the early 1990s, a range of tangy Worcester Sauce Twiglets was introduced. Jacobs also released a curry flavoured edition from 1999-2001, in collaboration with several Indian restaurant chains in Northern England. From 2010 until 2012, Tangy Twiglets were briefly re-released as a limited edition to commemorate Twiglets' 80th anniversary.\n\nTwiglets used to be manufactured partly from grain prepared using hammer milling machinery located at the Parker Brothers Lark Roller Mills in Mildenhall. The machinery was powered by water turbines fed by water from the river Lark and this process created the broken grains that give twiglets their crunchy irregular shape and texture, this water powered mill operating until the last decade of the 20th century in this capacity. \n\nTo celebrate the 85th anniversary of Twiglets in August 2014, United Biscuits hosted an event known as Camp Twiglet on the Cotswolds farm of Blur's Alex James. This included three wigwams made from Twiglets which were attributed to a local artist named Mrs Cakehead.\n\n"}
{"id": "31359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31359", "title": "Tapas", "text": "Tapas\n\nA tapa () is an appetizer or snack in Spanish cuisine and translates to small portion of any kind of Spanish cuisine.\n\nTapa may be cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or hot (such as \"chopitos\", which are battered, fried baby squid).\n\nIn some bars and restaurants in Spain and across the globe, tapas have evolved into a more sophisticated cuisine. Tapas can be combined to make a full meal. In some Central American countries, such snacks are known as \"bocas\". In parts of Mexico, similar dishes are called \"botanas\".\n\nThe word \"tapas\" is derived from the Spanish verb \"tapar\", \"to cover\", a cognate of the English \"top\".\n\nIn pre-19th century Spain tapas were served by \"posadas\", \"albergues\", or \"bodegas,\" offering meals and rooms for travellers. Since few innkeepers could write and few travellers read, inns offered their guests a sample of the dishes available, on a \"tapa\" (the word for pot cover in Spanish).\n\nAccording to \"The Joy of Cooking\", the original tapas were thin slices of bread or meat which sherry drinkers in Andalusian taverns used to cover their glasses between sips. This was a practical measure meant to prevent fruit flies from hovering over the sweet sherry (see below for more explanations). The meat used to cover the sherry was normally ham or chorizo, which are both very salty and activate thirst. Because of this, bartenders and restaurant owners created a variety of snacks to serve with sherry, thus increasing their alcohol sales. The tapas eventually became as important as the sherry.\n\nTapas have evolved through Spanish history by incorporating new ingredients and influences. Most of the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by the Romans, who introduced more extensive cultivation of the olive following their invasion of Spain in 212 B.C. and irrigation methods. The discovery of the New World brought the introduction of tomatoes, sweet and chili peppers, maize (corn), and potatoes, which were readily accepted and easily grown in Spain's microclimates.\n\nIt has also been claimed that tapas originated in the south of Spain during the time of the Spanish Inquisition as a means of publicly identifying \"conversos\", Jews who had converted to Christianity. Since tapas often consist in part of ham or other non-kosher foodstuffs, the reluctance of the \"conversos\" to eat whatever tapas dish was offered to them could be taken as a tacit admission that they had not abandoned their Jewish faith, thus tapas were a tool of the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nThere are many tapas competitions throughout Spain, but there is only one National Tapas competition, which is celebrated every year in November. Since 2008, the City of Valladolid and the International School of Culinary Arts have celebrated the International Tapas Competition for Culinary Schools. Various schools from around the world come to Spain annually to compete for the best tapa concept.\n\nThough the primary meaning of \"tapa\" is \"cover\" or \"lid\", it has in Spain also become a term for this style of food. The origin of this new meaning is uncertain but there are several theories:\n\n\nIn Spain, dinner is usually served between 9 and 11 p.m. (sometimes as late as midnight), leaving significant time between work and dinner. Therefore, Spaniards often go \"bar hopping\" () and eat tapas in the time between finishing work and having dinner. Since lunch is usually served between 1 and 4 p.m., another common time for tapas is weekend days around noon as a means of socializing before proper lunch at home.\n\nIn origin, a tapa was a free portion of food, generally small, served with any drink ordered. In Spain, tapas are traditional in Andalusia, Murcia, León, Extremadura and Ciudad Real.\n\nIt is very common for a bar or a small local restaurant to have eight to 12 different kinds of tapas in warming trays with glass partitions covering the food. They are often very strongly flavored with garlic, chilies or paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, saffron and sometimes in plentiful amounts of olive oil. Often, one or more of the choices is seafood (\"mariscos\"), often including anchovies, sardines or mackerel in olive oil, squid or others in a tomato-based sauce, sometimes with the addition of red or green peppers or other seasonings. It is rare to see a tapas selection not include one or more types of olives, such as Manzanilla or Arbequina olives. One or more types of bread are usually available to eat with any of the sauce-based tapas.\n\nIn Andalusia and certain places in Madrid, Castilla-La Mancha, Castile and León, Asturias, and Extremadura, when one goes to a bar and orders a drink, often a tapa will be served with it free. As a drink, it is usual to ask for a \"caña\" (small beer), a \"chato\" (glass of wine) or a \"mosto\" (grape juice). In several cities, entire zones are dedicated to tapas bars, each one serving its own unique dish. In León, one can find the Barrio Húmedo, in Logroño \"Calle Laurel\" and in Burgos \"Calle de la Sombrerería\" and \"Calle de San Lorenzo\".\n\nSometimes, especially in northern Spain, they are also called \"pinchos\" (\"pintxos\" in Basque) in Asturias, in Navarre, in La Rioja (Spain), the Basque Country, Cantabria and in some provinces, such as Salamanca, because many of them have a \"pincho\" or toothpick through them. The toothpick is used to keep whatever the snack is made of from falling off the slice of bread and to keep track of the number of tapas the customer has eaten. Differently priced tapas have different shapes or have toothpicks of different sizes. The price of a single tapa ranges from one to two euros. Another name for them is \"banderillas\" (diminutive of \"bandera\" \"flag\"), in part because some of them resemble the colorful spears used in bullfighting.\n\nTapas can be \"upgraded\" to bigger portions, equivalent to half a dish (\"media ración\") or a whole one (\"ración\"). This is generally more economical when tapas are being ordered by more than one person. The portions are usually shared by diners, and a meal made up of \"raciones\" resembles a Chinese \"dim sum\", Korean \"banchan\" or Middle Eastern \"mezze\".\n\nThe term \"tapas\" narrowly refers to a type of Spanish cuisine. More broadly, a similar format of dining is referred to as “small plates”. Such dishes are traditionally common in many parts of the world, and have become increasingly popular in the English-speaking world since about 2000, particularly under the influence of Spanish tapas.\n\nUpmarket tapas restaurants and tapas bars are common in many cities of the United States, Mexico, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. As with any cuisine exported from its original country, there can often be significant differences between the original Spanish dishes and the dishes as they are served abroad. \n\nIn Mexico, there are not many tapas bars. However, the \"cantinas botaneras\" come close to the Mexican version of a tapas bar, but they operate on a very different business model. The appetizers (\"botanas\") keep coming as long as the patron keeps ordering beer, liquor or mixed drinks. The more the patron drinks, the more he or she eats. These establishments, some over a hundred years old, such as La Opera, are particularly popular around the Centro Histórico in Mexico City, but there are similar cantinas farther out in other regions of the city (as in Coyoacán) and its metropolitan area, or even in other cities like Guadalajara, Jalisco and Xalapa, Veracruz.\n\n\"Picada\" is a type of tapas eaten in Argentina and Uruguay, usually involving only cold dishes, such as olives, ham, salami, mortadella, bologna, different types of cheese, marinated eggplants and red pimentos, sardines, nuts, corn puffs, fried wheat flour sticks, potato chips, and sliced baguette. It may also include hot dishes such as french fries, pizza or milanesa.\n\n () or () are served in the bars of Brazil and typical as tapas-like side dishes to accompany beer or other alcoholic drinks. The better bars tend to have a greater variety, and rarer, more traditional, dishes (using, for example, lamb or goat meat, which are relatively uncommon in the diet of urbanites in southern Brazil).\n\nPeople from the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, which had the most Portuguese and the second-most Spanish immigration in Brazil, are among those who are most proud of their bar culture as a symbol of the city's nightlife, but bars that serve a variety of tapas-like side dishes are common in all state capitals and cities with more than 700,000 inhabitants.\n\nMany tapas typical of Spanish cuisine that are rarer dishes in Portugal are more easily found in Brazil, due to the presence of the cultural heritage of the Spanish Brazilians as a result of immigration.\n\n\"Cicchetti\" are small tapas-like dishes served in cicchetti bars in Venice, Italy. Venetians typically eat \"cicchetti\" for lunch or as late-afternoon snacks.\n\nIn Korea, drinking establishments often serve \"anju\" (안주) of various types, including meat, seafood, and vegetables. In Japan, \"izakaya\" are drinking establishments that serve accompaniments similar to tapas. In Philippines, pulutan Filipino cuisine#Pulutan is the tapas-style food served to accompany liquor or beer.\n\n"}
{"id": "31395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31395", "title": "Tantra", "text": "Tantra\n\nTantra (; Sanskrit: तन्त्र, literally \"loom, weave, system\") denotes the esoteric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism that co-developed most likely about the middle of the 1st millennium AD. The term \"tantra\", in the Indian traditions, also means any systematic broadly applicable \"text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice\".\n\nStarting in the early centuries of common era, newly revealed Tantras centering on Vishnu, Shiva or Shakti emerged. In Buddhism, the Vajrayana tradition is known for its extensive tantra ideas and practices. Tantric Hindu and Buddhist traditions have influenced other Eastern religious traditions such as Jainism, the Tibetan Bön tradition, Daoism and the Japanese Shintō tradition.\n\nCertain modes of non-vedic worship such as Puja are considered tantric in their conception and rituals. Hindu temple building also generally conforms to the iconography of tantra. The Hindu texts that describe these topics are called Tantras, Āgamas or Samhitās. In Buddhism, its tantra-genre literature has influenced the artworks in Tibet, historic cave temples of India and imagery in Southeast Asia.\n\nTantra () literally means \"loom, warp, weave\".\n\nThe connotation of the word tantra to mean an esoteric practice or religious ritualism is a colonial era European invention. The term is based on the metaphor of weaving, states Ron Barrett, where the Sanskrit root \"tan\" means the warping of threads on a loom. It implies \"interweaving of traditions and teachings as threads\" into a text, technique or practice.\n\nThe word appears in the hymns of the \"Rigveda\" such as in 10.71, with the meaning of \"warp (weaving)\". It is found in many other Vedic era texts, such as in section 10.7.42 of the \"Atharvaveda\" and many Brahmanas. In these and post-Vedic texts, the contextual meaning of \"Tantra\" is that which is \"principal or essential part, main point, model, framework, feature\". In the Smritis and epics of Hinduism (and Jainism), the term means \"doctrine, rule, theory, method, technique or chapter\" and the word appears both as a separate word and as a common suffix, such as \"atma-tantra\" meaning \"doctrine or theory of Atman (soul, self)\".\n\nThe term \"Tantra\" after about 500 BC, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is a bibliographic category, just like the word Sutra (which means \"sewing together\", mirroring the metaphor of \"weaving together\" in \"Tantra\"). The same Buddhist texts are sometimes referred to as tantra or sutra; for example, \"Vairocabhisambodhi-tantra\" is also referred to as \"Vairocabhisambodhi-sutra\". The various contextual meanings of the word Tantra vary with the Indian text and are summarized in the appended table.\nThe 5th-century BC scholar Pāṇini in his Sutra 1.4.54–55 of Sanskrit grammar, cryptically explains tantra through the example of \"Sva-tantra\" (Sanskrit: स्वतन्त्र), which he states means \"independent\" or a person who is his own \"warp, cloth, weaver, promoter, karta (actor)\". Patanjali in his \"Mahābhāṣya\" quotes and accepts Panini's definition, then discusses or mentions it at a greater length, in 18 instances, stating that its metaphorical definition of \"warp (weaving), extended cloth\" is relevant to many contexts. The word \"tantra\", states Patanjali, means \"principal, main\".\n\nHe uses the same example of \"svatantra\" as a composite word of \"sva\" (self) and tantra, then stating \"svatantra\" means \"one who is self-dependent, one who is his own master, the principal thing for whom is himself\", thereby interpreting the definition of tantra. Patanjali also offers a semantic definition of Tantra, stating that it is structural rules, standard procedures, centralized guide or knowledge in any field that applies to many elements.\n\nThe ancient Mimamsa school of Hinduism uses the term tantra extensively, and its scholars offer various definitions. For example:\n\nMedieval texts present their own definitions of Tantra. \"\", for example, gives the following explanation of the term \"tantra\":\n\nThe occultist and businessman Pierre Bernard (1875–1955) is widely credited with introducing the philosophy and practices of tantra to the American people, at the same time creating a misleading impression of its connection to sex.\n\nIn modern scholarship, Tantra has been studied as an esoteric practice and ritualistic religion, sometimes referred to as Tantrism. There is a wide gap between what Tantra means to its followers, and what Tantra has been represented or perceived as since colonial era writers began commenting on Tantra. Many definitions of Tantra have been proposed since, and there is no universally accepted definition. André Padoux, in his review of Tantra definitions offers two, then rejects both. One definition, due to Padoux, is found among Tantra practitioners — it is any \"system of observances\" about the vision of man and the cosmos where correspondences between the inner world of the person and the macrocosmic reality play an essential role. Another definition, more common among observers and non-practitioners, is some \"set of mechanistic rituals, omitting entirely the ideological side\".\n\nTantric traditions have been studied mostly from textual and historical perspectives. Anthropological work on living Tantric tradition is scarce, and ethnography has rarely engaged with the study of Tantra. This is arguably a result of the modern construction of Tantrism as occult, esoteric and secret. Some scholars have tried to demystify the myth of secrecy in contemporary Tantric traditions, suggesting new methodological avenues to overcome the ethical and epistemological problems in the study of living Tantric traditions.\n\nAccording to David N. Lorenzen, two different kinds of definitions of Tantra exist, narrow and broad. According to the narrow definition, Tantrism, or \"Tantric religion\", is the elite traditions directly based on the Sanskrit texts called the Tantras, Samhitas, and Agamas. Lorenzen's \"broad definition\" extends this by including a broad range of \"magical beliefs and practices\" such as Yoga and Shaktism.\n\nRichard Payne states that Tantra has been commonly but incorrectly associated with sex, given popular culture's prurient obsession with intimacy. Tantra has been labelled as the \"yoga of ecstasy\", driven by senseless ritualistic libertinism. This is far from the diverse and complex understanding of what Tantra means to those Buddhists, Hindu and Jains who practice it.\n\nDavid Gray disagrees with broad generalizations and states that defining Tantra is a difficult task because \"Tantra traditions are manifold, spanning several religious traditions and cultural worlds. As a result they are also diverse, which makes it a significant challenge to come up with an adequate definition\". The challenge of defining Tantra is compounded by the fact that it has been a historically significant part of major Indian religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in and outside South Asia and East Asia. To its practitioners, Tantra is defined as a combination of texts, techniques, rituals, monastic practices, meditation, yoga, and ideology.\n\nAccording to Georg Feuerstein, \"The scope of topics discussed in the Tantras is considerable. They deal with the creation and history of the world; the names and functions of a great variety of male and female deities and other higher beings; the types of ritual worship (especially of Goddesses); magic, sorcery, and divination; esoteric \"physiology\" (the mapping of the subtle or psychic body); the awakening of the mysterious serpent power (kundalinî-shakti); techniques of bodily and mental purification; the nature of enlightenment; and not least, sacred sexuality.\" Hindu puja, temples and iconography all show tantric influence. These texts, states Gavin Flood, contain representation of \"the body in philosophy, in ritual and in art\", which are linked to \"techniques of the body, methods or technologies developed within the tantric traditions intended to transform body and self\".\n\nThe term \"tantrism\" is a 19th-century European invention not present in any Asian language; compare \"Sufism\", of similar Orientalist origin. According to Padoux, \"Tantrism\" is a Western term and notion, not a category that is used by the so-called \"Tantrists\" themselves. The term was introduced by 19th-century Indologists, with limited knowledge of India and in whose view Tantrism was a particular, unusual and minority practice in contrast to Indian traditions they believed to be mainstream.\n\nRobert Brown similarly notes that \"tantrism\" is a construct of Western scholarship, not a concept of the religious system itself. He defines Tantrism as an apologetic label of Westerners for a system that they little understand that is \"not coherent\" and which is \"an accumulated set of practices and ideas from various sources, that has varied between its practitioners within a group, varied across groups, across geography and over its history\". It is a system, adds Brown, that gives each follower the freedom to mix Tantric elements with non-Tantric aspects, to challenge and transgress any and all norms, experiment with \"the mundane to reach the supramundane\".\n\nTeun Goudriaan in his 1981 review of Hindu Tantrism, states that Tantrism usually means a \"systematic quest for salvation or spiritual excellence\" by realizing and fostering the divine within one's own body, one that is simultaneous union of the masculine-feminine and spirit-matter, and has the ultimate goal of realizing the \"primal blissful state of non-duality\". It is typically a methodically striven system, consisting of voluntarily chosen specific practices which may include Tantric items such as mantras (\"bijas\"), geometric patterns and symbols (\"mandala\"), gestures (\"mudra\"), mapping of the microcosm within one's body to the macrocosmic elements outside as the subtle body (\"kundalini-yoga\"), assignments of icons and sounds (\"nyasa\"), meditation (\"dhyana\"), ritual worship (\"puja\"), initiation (\"diksha\") and others. Tantrism, adds Goudriaan, is a living system that is decidedly monistic, but with wide variations, and it is impossible to be dogmatic about a simple or fixed definition.\n\nTantrism is an overarching term for \"Tantric traditions\", states David Gray in a 2016 review, that combine Vedic, yogic and meditative traditions from ancient Hinduism as well as rival Buddhist and Jain traditions. it is a neologism of western scholars and does not reflect the self-understanding of any particular tantric tradition. While Goudriaan's description is useful, adds Gray, there is no single defining universal characteristic common to all Tantra traditions, being an open evolving system. Tantrism, whether Buddhist or Hindu, can best be characterized as practices, a set of techniques, with a strong focus on rituals and meditation, by those who believe that it is a path to liberation that is characterized by both knowledge and freedom.\n\nAccording to Padoux, the term \"Tantrika\" is based on a comment by Kulluka Bhatta on \"Manava Dharmasastra 2.1\", who contrasted \"vaidika\" and \"tantrika\" forms of Sruti (canonical texts). The Tantrika, to Bhatta, is that literature which forms a parallel part of the Hindu tradition, independent of the Vedic corpus. The Vedic and non-Vedic (Tantric) paths are seen as two different approaches to ultimate reality, the Vedic approach based on Brahman, and Tantrika being based on the non-Vedic Āgama texts. Despite Bhatta attempt to clarify, states Padoux, in reality Hindus and Buddhists have historically felt free to borrow and blend ideas from all sources, Vedic, non-Vedic and in the case of Buddhism, its own canonical works.\n\nOne of the key differences between the Tantric and non-Tantric traditions – whether it be orthodox Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism – is their assumptions about the need for monastic or ascetic life. Non-Tantrika, or orthodox traditions in all three major ancient Indian religions, hold that the worldly life of a householder is one driven by desires and greeds which are a serious impediment to spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya). These orthodox traditions teach renunciation of householder life, a mendicant's life of simplicity and leaving all attachments to become a monk or nun. In contrast, the Tantrika traditions hold, states Robert Brown, that \"both enlightenment and worldly success\" are achievable, and that \"this world need not be shunned to achieve enlightenment\".\n\nThe Keśin hymn of the \"Rig Veda\" (10.136) describes the \"wild loner\" who, states Karel Werner, \"carrying within oneself fire and poison, heaven and earth, ranging from enthusiasm and creativity to depression and agony, from the heights of spiritual bliss to the heaviness of earth-bound labor\". The Rigveda uses words of admiration for these loners, and whether it is related to Tantra or not, has been variously interpreted. According to David Lorenzen, it describes \"munis\" (sages) experiencing Tantra-like \"ecstatic, altered states of consciousness\" and gaining the ability \"to fly on the wind\". In contrast, Werner suggests that these are early Yoga pioneers and accomplished yogis of the ancient pre-Buddhist Indian tradition, and that this Vedic hymn is speaking of those \"lost in thoughts\" whose \"personalities are not bound to earth, for they follow the path of the mysterious wind\".\n\nThe two oldest Upanishadic scriptures of Hinduism, the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" in section 4.2 and \"Chandogya Upanishad\" in section 8.6, refer to nadis (\"hati\") in presenting their theory on how the Atman (soul) and the body are connected and interdependent through energy carrying arteries when one is awake or sleeping, but they do not mention anything related to Tantric practices. The \"Shvetashvatara Upanishad\" describes breath control that became a standard part of Yoga, but Tantric practices do not appear in it. The \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" are an early codification of Yogic practices. Later, according to Lorenzen, these early Yoga-related ideas develop into Hatha Yoga, and then diversify into the \"mystical anatomy\" of \"nadis\" and \"chakras\" of Tantric practices. The 7th-century shamanic-yogic component of Tantrism appears clearly in Tantric form in Bāṇabhaṭṭa's \"Harshacharita\" and Daṇḍin's \"Dashakumaracharita\". In contrast to this theory of Lorenzen, other scholars such as Mircea Eliade consider Yoga and the evolution of Yogic practices to be separate and distinct from the evolution of Tantra and Tantric practices.\n\nDavid Gordon White views Yogini cults as foundational to early tantra but disputes scholars who see their roots in an \"autochthonous non-Vedic source\" such indigenous tribes or the Indus Valley Civilization. Instead, White suggests Vedic Srauta texts mention offerings to goddesses Rākā, Sinīvālī, and Kuhū in a manner similar to a tantric ritual. Frederick Smith – a professor of Sanskrit and Classical Indian Religions, views Tantra to be a parallel religious movement to Bhakti movement of the 1st millennium AD. Tantra along with Ayurveda, states Smith, has traditionally been attributed to \"Atharvaveda\", but this attribution is one of respect not of historicity. Ayurveda has primarily been an empirical practice with Vedic roots, but Tantra has been an esoteric, folk movement without grounding that can be traced to anything in \"Atharvaveda\" or any other vedic text.\n\nA series of artwork discovered in Gandhara, in modern-day Pakistan, dated to be from about 1st century AD, show Buddhist and Hindu monks holding skulls. One of them shows the Buddha sitting in the center, and on one side sits a Buddhist monk and on the other side sits a Hindu monk. The legend corresponding to these artworks is found in Buddhist texts, and describes monks \"who tap skulls and forecast the future rebirths of the person to whom that skull belonged\". According to Robert Brown, these Buddhist skull-tapping reliefs suggest tantric practices may have been vogue by the 1st century AD to appear prominently in Buddhist art and its texts.\n\nThe \"Mahabharata\", the \"Harivamsa\", the \"Devi Mahatmya\" in the \"Markandeya Purana\" all contain references to the fierce, demon-killing manifestations of the Great Goddess, Mahishamardini, who is identified with Durga-Parvati. These suggest reverence and worship for Goddess in the India culture was an established tradition (Shaktism), by the early centuries of the 1st millennium. However, this does not mean Tantric rituals and practices were as yet a part of either Hindu or Buddhist traditions. \"Apart from the somewhat dubious reference to Tantra in the Gangadhar inscription of 423 CE\", states David Lorenzen, it is only 7th-century Banabhatta's \"Kadambari\" which provide convincing proof of Tantra and Tantric texts.\n\nAccording to Flood, the earliest date for the Tantra texts related to Tantric practices is AD 600, though most of them were probably composed after the 8th century onwards. By the 10th century an extensive corpus existed. Regionally, the tantric texts were mostly composed during this period in Kashmir and Nepal. They were also called agamas in Shaivism, samhita or \"Pancaratra\" in Vaishnavism, and as tantras in Shaktism. The Buddhists developed their own corpus of Tantras, which became the textual basis of Vajrayana. In Jainism, secondary texts suggest a substantial Tantra corpus based on the Surya tradition developed in the western regions of India, but complete manuscripts of these have not survived into the modern era. Among the Hindus, those belonging to the Vedic orthodox traditions rejected the Tantra texts, the Tantric followers incorporated the Vedic ideas within their own systems considering the Tantras as the higher, refined understanding of older ideas. Some considered the Tantra texts to be superior to the Vedas, while others considered them complementary:\n\nAccording to Flood, very little is known about who created the Tantras, nor much is known about the social status of these and medieval era Tantrikas. The Tantra pioneers may have been ascetics who lived at the cremation grounds, possibly from \"above low-caste groups\" states Flood, and these were probably non-Brahmanical. These Hindu renouncers and ascetics trace back to far more ancient traditions, and they are mentioned in the Buddhist Pali canon. By the early medieval times, their practices may have included the imitation of the deities such as goddess Kali and god Bhairava, with offerings of non-vegetarian food, alcohol and sexual substances. According to this theory, these practitioners would have invited their deities to \"avesha mam\" (enter me), then reverted the role in order to control that deity and gain its power. These ascetics would have been supported by low castes living at the cremation places.\n\nThe early Tantric practices in Indian history are sometimes attributed to the Kapalikas (literally, \"skull men\", also called \"Somasiddhatins\" or \"Mahavartins\"). Little, however, is reliably known about them, and there is a paucity of primary sources on Kapalikas. The historical information about them is primarily available from dubious fictional works and the disparaging remarks made about them in the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts of the 1st millennium AD.\n\nIn Hāla’s \"Gatha-saptasati\" (composed by the 5th century AD), for example, the story calls a female character Kapalika, whose lover dies, he is cremated, she takes his cremation ashes and smears her body with it. The 6th-century Varāhamihira mentions Kapalikas in his literary works. Some of the Kāpālika practices mentioned in these texts are those found in Shaiva Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism, and scholars disagree on who influenced whom.\n\nThese early historical mentions are in passing and appear to be Tantra-like practices, they are not detailed nor comprehensive presentation of Tantric beliefs and practices. Epigraphic references to the \"Kaulas\" Tantric practices are rare. Reference is made in the early 9th century to \"vama\" (left-hand) Tantras of the Kaulas. Literary evidence suggests Tantric Buddhism was probably flourishing by the 7th-century. Matrikas, or fierce mother goddesses that later are closely linked to Tantra practices, appear both in Buddhist and Hindu arts and literature between the 7th and 10th centuries.\n\nTantra probably gained traction after 6th century, post-Gupta Empire era. Tantric practices were known by the 7th century, flourished between the 8th or 9th century and the 14th century.\n\nMajor Tantric texts had been written by the 10th century, particularly in Kashmir, Nepal and Bengal. By the 10th or 11th century, Tantric texts had been translated into regional languages such as Tamil, and Tantric practices probably had spread across South Asia. It was broadly influential, with Flood describing it as follows:\nThe 13th-century Dvaita Vedanta philosopher Madhvacharya wrote copious commentaries on then existing major schools of Indian philosophies and practices, and cited the works of the 10th century Abhinavagupta considered as a major and influential Tantra scholar. However, Madhvacharya does not mention Tantra as a separate, distinct religious or ritual-driven practice. The early 20th-century Indian scholar Pandurang Vaman Kane conjectured that Madhvacharya ignored Tantra because it may have been considered scandalous. In contrast, Padoux suggests that Tantra may have been so pervasive by the 13th century that \"it was not regarded as being a distinct system.\"\n\nTantrism further spread with the silk road transmission of Buddhism to East and Southeast Asia, and also influenced the Bön tradition of Tibet.\n\nThe Tantra texts and tantric practices involve a wide range of topics, mostly focused on spiritual topics, and not of a sexual nature. However, states Gavin Flood, Tantrism is more known in the West as being notorious for its antinomian elements, stereotypically portrayed as a practice that is esoteric eroticism and ritualized sex in the name of religion, one imbued with alcohol and offering of meat to fierce deities. This portrayal is not limited to the Western imagination, however. Jayanta Bhatta, the 9th-century scholar of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy and who commented on Tantra literature, stated that the Tantric ideas and spiritual practices are mostly well placed, but it also has \"immoral teachings\" such as by the so-called \"Nilambara\" sect where its practitioners \"wear simply one blue garment, and then as a group engage in unconstrained public sex\" on festivals. He wrote, this practice is unnecessary and it threatens fundamental values of society.\nSexuality has been a part of Tantric practices, sexual fluids have been viewed as \"power substances\" and used ritualistically. Some extreme texts, states Flood, go further such as the Buddhist text \"Candamaharosana-tantra\" advocating consumption of bodily waste products as \"power substances\", teaching the waste should be consumed as a diet \"eaten by all the Buddhas\" without slightest disgust. However, such esoteric practices are exceptional and extreme, they are not found in much of Buddhist and Hindu Tantric literature or practices. In the Kaula tradition and others where sexual fluids as power substances and ritual sex are mentioned, scholars disagree in their translations, interpretations and practical significance.\n\nDouglas Renfrew Brooks, for example, states that the antinomian elements such as the use of intoxicating substances and sex were not animistic, but were adopted in some Kaula traditions to challenge the Tantric devotee to break down the \"distinctions between the ultimate reality of Brahman and the mundane physical and mundane world\". By combining erotic and ascetic techniques, states Brooks, the Tantric broke down all social and internal assumptions, became Shiva-like. In Kashmir Shaivism, states David Gray, the antinomian transgressive ideas were internalized, for meditation and reflection, and as a means to \"realize a transcendent subjectivity\".\n\nIn most Hindu and Buddhist Tantra texts, extreme forms of sexual ritualism is absent. In Jain tantric text, this is entirely absent. Yet, emotions, eroticism and sex are universally regarded in Tantric literature as natural, desirable, a means of transformation of the deity within, to \"reflect and recapitulate the bliss of Shiva and Shakti\". \"Kama\" and sex is another aspect of life and a \"root of the universe\", in the Tantric view, whose purpose extends beyond procreation and is another means to spiritual journey and fulfillment. This idea flowers with the inclusion of kama art in Hindu temple arts, and its various temple architecture and design manuals such as the \"Shilpa-prakasha\" by the Hindu scholar Ramachandra Kulacara.\n\nRituals are the main focus of the \"Tantras\". Rather than one coherent system, Tantra is an accumulation of practices and ideas. Because of the wide range of communities covered by the term, it is problematic to describe tantric practices definitively.\n\nAndré Padoux notes that there is no consensus among scholars as to which elements are characteristic for Tantra, nor is there any text that contains all those elements. Also, most of those elements can also be found in non-Tantric traditions. According to Anthony Tribe, a scholar of Buddhist Tantra, Tantra has the following defining features:\n\nAccording to David N. Lorenzen, Tantra practices include the following:\n\nA number of techniques (sadhana) are used as aids for meditation and achieving spiritual power:\n\nAccording to David Gordon White, mandalas are a key element of Tantra. They represent the constant flow and interaction of both divine, demonic, human and animal energy or impulses (\"kleshas\", \"cetanā\", \"taṇhā\") in the universe. The mandala is a mesocosm, which mediates between the \"transcendent-yet-immanent\" macrocosm and the microcosm of mundane human experience. The godhead is at the center of the mandala, while all other beings, including the practitioner, are located at various distances from this center. Mandalas also reflected the medieaval feudal system, with the king at its centre.\n\nThe godhead is both transcendent and immanent, and the world is regarded as real, and not as an illusion. The goal is not to transcend the world, but to realize that the world is the manifestation of the godhead, while the \"I\" is \"the supreme egoity of the godhead.\" The world is to be seen with the eyes of the godhead, realizing that it is a manifestation as oneself. The totality of all that is a \"realm of Dharma\" which shares a common principle. The supreme is manifest in everyone, which is to be realized through Tantric practice.\n\nThe words \"mantram\", \"tantram\" and \"yantram\" are rooted linguistically and phonologically in ancient Indian traditions. \"Mantram\" denotes the chant, or \"knowledge.\" \"Tantram\" denotes philosophy, or ritual actions. \"Yantram\" denotes the means by which a person is expected to lead their life.\n\nThe mantra and yantra are instruments to invoke higher qualities, often associated with specific Hindu deities such as Shiva, Shakti, or Kali. Similarly, \"puja\" may involve focusing on a \"yantra\" or \"mandala\" associated with a deity.\n\nEach mantra is associated with a specific Nyasa. Nyasa involves touching various parts of the body at specific parts of the mantra, thought to invoke the deity in the body. There are several types of Nyasas; the most important are \"Kara Nyasa\" and \"Anga Nyasa\".\n\nThe deities are internalised as attributes of \"Ishta devata\" meditations, with practitioners visualizing themselves as the deity or experiencing the \"darshan\" (vision) of the deity. During meditation the initiate identifies with any of the Hindu gods and goddesses, visualising and internalising them in a process similar to sexual courtship and consummation. The \"Tantrika\" practitioner may use visualizations of deities, identifying with a deity to the degree that the aspirant \"becomes\" the \"Ishta-deva\" (or meditational deity).\n\nIn Hindu Tantra, uniting the deity and the devotee uses meditation and ritual practices. These practices are divided among three classes of devotees: the animal, heroic, and the divine. In the divine devotee, the rituals are internal. The divine devotee is the only one who can attain the object of the rituals (awakening energy).\n\nIn Hinduism, the tantric traditions are found in Shaivism's Shaiva Siddhanta and the Mantrapīṭha (Bhairava-centred), and in Shaktism's Vidyāpīṭha and the Kulamārga traditions.\n\nThe Tantra texts of the Vaishnava tradition are the Pancharatra, and typically called the Agamas in the Shaiva traditions. The term \"Tantra\" in Hindu genre of literature is usually used specifically to refer to Shakta Agamas. The Agamas literature is voluminous, and includes 28 Shaiva Agamas, 77 Shakta Agamas (also called Tantras), and 108 Vaishnava Agamas (also called Pancharatra Samhitas), and numerous Upa-Agamas.\n\nSome Tantra texts in Hinduism are Vedic and others non-Vedic. Agama traditions include Yoga and Self Realization concepts, some include Kundalini Yoga, asceticism, and philosophies ranging from \"Dvaita\" (dualism) to \"Advaita\" (monism).\n\nThe means of worship in the Hindu Tantric practice differs from the Vedic form. While the Vedic practice of yajna there are no idols and shrines, in its Tantric traditions, idols and symbolic icons with puja are the means of worship. Temples, symbolism, icons that remind the devotee of attributes and values are a necessary part of the Agamic practice, while non-theistic paths are one of the many alternative means in the Vedic practice. This, however, does not necessarily mean that Tantra-Agamas and Vedas are opposed, according to medieval era Hindu theologians. Tirumular, for example, explained their link as, \"the Vedas are the path, and the Agamas are the horse\".\n\nEach Tantra-Agama text consists of four parts:\n\nThe Tantra-Agama texts of Hinduism present a diverse range of philosophies, ranging from theistic dualism to absolute monism. This diversity of views was acknowledged in Chapter 36 of Tantraloka, the 10th century scholar Abhinavagupta. In Shaivism alone, there are ten dualistic (dvaita) Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism (bhedabheda) Agama texts, and sixty four monism (advaita) Agama texts. The Bhairava Shastras are monistic Tantra texts, while Shiva Shastras are dualistic.\n\nMany tantric traditions developed within Buddhism, over its history in South Asia and East Asia. These are also called the Vajrayana traditions. The tradition has been particularly prevalent in Tibet and Nepal. The Buddhist Tantric practices and texts, states Jacob Dalton, developed between the 5th and the 7th centuries and this is evidenced by Chinese Buddhist translations of Indian texts from that period preserved in Dunhuang. Ryan Overbey too affirms this, stating that Buddhist Tantric spells and ritual texts were translated by Chinese Buddhist scholars six times and these spells appear in multiple texts between the 5th and 8th centuries.\n\nAccording to Alexis Sanderson, various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism. The Mañjusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri. The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Shaiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Shaiva text \"Tantrasadbhava\", introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.\n\nThe Tantric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism spread rapidly within India and Tibet, and from there to Southeast Asia, East Asia and Central Asia. They significantly influenced many other religious traditions such Jainism, Sikhism, the Tibetan Bön tradition, Daoism, and the Japanese Shintō tradition. In the Sikh literature, the ideas related to Shakti and goddess reverence attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, particularly in the \"Dasam Granth\", are related to tantra ideas found in Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nThe Jain worship methods, states Ellen Gough, were likely influenced by Shaktism ideas, and this is attested by the tantric diagrams of the \"Rishi-mandala\" where the Tirthankaras are portrayed. The Tantric traditions within Jainism use verbal spells or mantra, and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.\n\nThe first Western scholar to seriously study Tantra was John Woodroffe (1865–1936), who wrote about Tantra under the pen name Arthur Avalon and is known as the \"founding father of Tantric studies\". Unlike previous Western scholars Woodroffe advocated for Tantra, defending and presenting it as an ethical and philosophical system in accord with the Vedas and Vedanta. Woodroffe practised Tantra and, while trying to maintain scholastic objectivity, was a student of Hindu Tantra (the \"Shiva-Shakta\" tradition).\n\nFollowing Woodroffe a number of scholars began investigating Tantric teachings, including scholars of comparative religion and Indology such as Agehananda Bharati, Mircea Eliade, Julius Evola, Carl Jung, Giuseppe Tucci and Heinrich Zimmer. According to Hugh Urban, Zimmer, Evola and Eliade viewed Tantra as \"the culmination of all Indian thought: the most radical form of spirituality and the archaic heart of aboriginal India\", regarding it as the ideal religion for the modern era. All three saw Tantra as \"the most transgressive and violent path to the sacred\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31423", "title": "Tom Collins", "text": "Tom Collins\n\nThe Tom Collins is a Collins cocktail made from gin, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water. First memorialized in writing in 1876 by Jerry Thomas, \"the father of American mixology\", this \"gin and sparkling lemonade\" drink is typically served in a Collins glass over ice. A \"Collins mix\" can be bought premixed at stores and enjoyed alone (like a soft drink) or with gin.\n\nIn August 1891, British physician Sir Morell Mackenzie wrote an article in the influential 19th century magazine \"Fortnightly Review\" claiming that England was the originating country for the Tom Collins cocktail and a person named John Collins was its creator. In the article, Mackenzie quoted an old song, the title of which he indicated to be \"John Collins.\" However, the British weekly magazine \"Punch\" immediately disparaged Mackenzie's efforts, noting in August 1891 that the title of the song actually was \"Jim Collins\" and that Mackenzie otherwise inaccurately quoted and characterized the song.\n\nA drink called a John Collins did exist prior to the Tom Collins hoax of 1874. A recipe for it appears in the \"Steward and Barkeeper's Manual\" of 1869. Cocktail historian David Wondrich stated that there are several other earlier mentions of this version of the drink and that it does bear a striking resemblance to the gin punches served at London clubs like the Garrick in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nConfusion over the cocktail's origins continued as American writer Charles Montgomery Skinner noted in 1898 that the Tom Collins had made its way to the \"American Bars\" in England, France, and Germany, where the American invention stimulated curiosity in Europe and served as a reflection of American art.\n\nAs time passed, interest in the Tom Collins diminished and its origins became lost. Early on during the 1920s Prohibition in the United States, the American journalist and student of American English H. L. Mencken said:The origin of the ... Tom-Collins ... remains to be established; the historians of alcoholism, like the philologists, have neglected them. But the essentially American character of [this and other drinks] is obvious, despite the fact that a number have gone over into English. The English, in naming their drinks, commonly display a far more limited imagination. Seeking a name, for example, for a mixture of whiskey and soda- water, the best they could achieve was whiskey-and-soda. The Americans, introduced to the same drink, at once gave it the far more original name of high-ball.\n\nA drink known as a John Collins has existed since the 1860s at the very least and is believed to have originated with a headwaiter of that name who worked at Limmer's Old House in Conduit Street in Mayfair, which was a popular London hotel and coffee house around 1790–1817.\n\nThe following rhyme was written by Frank and Charles Sheridan about John Collins:\n<poem>My name is John Collins, head waiter at Limmer's,\nCorner of Conduit Street, Hanover Square,\nMy chief occupation is filling brimmers\nFor all the young gentlemen frequenters there.</poem>\n\nA recipe for a John Collins is featured in the \"Steward and Barkeeper's Manual\" of 1869:\n<poem>\nTeaspoonful of powdered sugar\nThe juice of half a lemon\nA wine glass of Old Tom Gin\nA bottle of plain soda\nShake up, or stir up with ice. Add a slice of lemon peel to finish.\n</poem>\n\nDrinks historian David Wondrich has speculated that the original recipe that was introduced to New York in the 1850s would have been very similar to the gin punches that are known to have been served at fashionable London clubs such as the Garrick during the first half of the 19th century. He states that these would have been along the lines of \"gin, lemon juice, chilled soda water, and maraschino liqueur\".\n\nThe specific call for Old Tom gin in the 1869 recipe is a likely cause for the subsequent name change to \"Tom Collins\" in Jerry Thomas's 1876 recipe. Earlier versions of the gin punch are likely to have used Hollands instead.\n\nSome confusion regarding the origin of the drink and the cause for its change of name has arisen in the past due to the following:\n\nIn 1874, people in New York, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere in the United States would start a conversation with \"Have you seen Tom Collins?\" After the listener predictably reacts by explaining that they did not know a Tom Collins, the speaker would assert that Tom Collins was talking about the listener to others and that Tom Collins was \"just around the corner\", \"in a [local] bar,\" or somewhere else near. The conversation about the nonexistent Tom Collins was a proven hoax of exposure. In The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, as it became known, the speaker would encourage the listener to act foolishly by reacting to patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. In particular, the speaker desired the listener to become agitated at the idea of someone talking about them to others such that the listener would rush off to find the purportedly nearby Tom Collins. Similar to the New York Zoo hoax of 1874, several newspapers propagated the very successful practical joke by printing stories containing false sightings of Tom Collins. The 1874 hoax quickly gained such notoriety that several 1874 music hall songs memorialized the event (copies of which now are in the U.S. Library of Congress).\n\nThe recipe for the Tom Collins first appeared in the 1876 edition of Jerry Thomas' \"Bar-Tender's Guide.\" Since New York based Thomas would have known about the widespread hoax and the contents of the 1876 published book were developed during or right after The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, it was believed by George Sinclair that the hoax event was the most plausible source of the name for the Tom Collins cocktail. Classified under the heading \"Collins\" with similarly named whisky and brandy drinks, Jerry Thomas' Tom Collins Gin instructed:\n\n<poem>Jerry Thomas' Tom Collins Gin (1876)\nTake 5 or 6 dashes of gum syrup.\nJuice of a small lemon.\n1 large wine-glass of gin.\n2 or 3 lumps of ice;\nShake up well and strain into a large bar-glass. Fill up the glass with plain soda water and drink while it is lively.</poem>\n\nThis was distinguished from the Gin Fizz cocktail in that the 3 dashes of lemon juice in the Gin Fizz was \"fizzed\" with carbonated water to essentially form a \"Gin and Sodawater\" whereas the considerably more \"juice of a small lemon\" in the Tom Collins essentially formed a \"Gin and Sparkling Lemonade\" when sweetened with the gum syrup. The type of gin used by Thomas was not specified in his 1876 book, but was most likely Old Tom if that was responsible for the change in the drink's name. If, alternatively, the change in name was caused by the popularity of the Tom Collins Hoax of 1874 then it is more probable that Holland gin rather than English London Dry Gin was intended since Jerry Thomas' Gin Fizz (1862) called for Holland gin and Hollands Gin (Jenever) was imported into the United States at that time at a ratio of approximately 6 liters to every liter of English Old Tom Gin.\n\nBy 1878, the Tom Collins was being served in the bar rooms of New York City and elsewhere. Identified as among 'the favorite drinks which are in demand everywhere' in an advertisement for the 1878 edition of \"The Modern Bartender's Guide\" by O. H. Byron, both Tom Collins gin and whiskey and Tom Collins brandy were considered fancy drinks. In the 1891 book, \"The Flowing Bowl: When and what to Drink,\" author William Schmidt listed the Tom Collins as including:\n\n<poem>Tom Collins Gin (1891)\nThe juice of half a lemon in a large glass,\na bar-spoonful of sugar,\na drink of Tom gin; mix this well;\n2 lumps of ice,\na bottle of plain soda.\nMix well and serve.</poem>\n\nOne turn of the 20th century recipe subsequently replaced the lemon juice with lime juice.\n\nAn alternative history places the origin in St. Louis.\n\nThe 1986 \"The Book of Cocktails\" provides a modern take on Thomas' 1876 recipe for this long drink:John (or Tom) Collins (1986)<br>ice cubes<br>2 oz. [6 cL] dry gin<br>2 oz. [6 cL] lemon juice<br>1 teaspoon sugar (gomme) syrup<br>soda water<br>slice of lemon<br>1 colored cherry<br>Place ample ice in large glass. Add gin, lemon juice and syrup. Top up with soda water and stir well. Serve with lemon slice, cherry and a straw.\n\nThe Juan Collins is a Collins cocktail made from tequila, lime juice, sugar or some other sweetening agent, and club soda. It is a variation of the original Tom Collins, first memorialized in writing in 1876 by \"the father of American mixology\" Jerry Thomas. This drink typically is served in a Collins glass over ice.\n\n"}
{"id": "32434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32434", "title": "Veal", "text": "Veal\n\nVeal is the meat of calves, in contrast to the beef from older cattle. Veal can be produced from a calf of either sex and any breed; however, most veal comes from young males of dairy breeds which are not used for breeding. Generally, veal is more expensive than beef from older cattle.\n\nUS veal farmers have changed their practices to address past animal welfare concerns.\n\nThere are several types of veal, although some terminology varies by country. Types of veal include:\n\nVeal has been an important ingredient in Italian, French and other Mediterranean cuisines from ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian \"cotoletta\" or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include fried \"escalopes\", fried veal \"Grenadines\" (small, thick fillet steaks), stuffed \"paupiettes\", roast joints, and \"blanquettes\". Because veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish made with breaded veal cutlets.\n\nIn addition to providing meat, the bones of calves are used to make a stock that forms the base for sauces and soups such as demi-glace. Calf stomachs are also used to produce rennet, which is used in the production of cheese. Calf offal is also widely regarded as the most prized animal offal. Most valued are the liver, sweetbreads, kidney, and bone marrow. The head, brains, tongue, feet, and mesentery are also valued.\n\nMale dairy calves are commonly used for veal production as they do not lactate and are therefore surplus to the requirements of the dairy industry.\n\nNewborn veal calves are generally given only a limited amount of time with their mothers, varying from a few hours to a few days. Free-raised calves are raised alongside their mothers, and always have access to their mothers' milk, but this is a rare occurrence.\n\nThree different primary types of housing used for veal calves: hutches, pens, or various types of group housing.\n\n\"Milk-fed\" veal calves consume a diet consisting of milk replacer, formulated with mostly milk-based proteins and added vitamins and minerals supplemented with solid feeds. This type of diet is similar to infant formula and is also one of the most common diets used for calves in the veal industry.\n\n\"Grain-fed\" calves normally consume a diet of milk replacer for the first six to eight weeks and then move on to a mostly corn-based diet. \n\n\"Free-raised\" calves are raised on open pastures and receive a diet of milk, grass, and fresh water. Furthermore, free-raised calves do not receive antibiotics, which are often a focus of criticism among animal welfare organizations.\n\nVeal farmers have a priority to provide quality care to the calves that are raised on the farm. A farm veterinarian will create and provide a health program that will promote a healthy herd. Veal calves need proper amounts of water, adequate nutrition, and safe and comfortable environments to thrive.\n\nVeal production is a controversial topic in animal welfare and some methods are cited as animal cruelty by multiple animal welfare organizations. These organizations and some of their members consider several practices and procedures of veal production to be inhumane. Public efforts by these organizations are placing pressure on the veal industry to change some of its methods.\n\nSome of these controversial practices are relevant to both group and individual housing systems.\n\nOne aspect of veal production cited as cruelty in the industry is the lack of space veal calves are provided. Space is often deliberately restricted by the producer to stop the animal from exercising, as this makes the meat turn redder and tougher.\n\nSome systems of veal production rear calves that are denied access to any solid feed and are fed a liquid milk replacer. They may also be deprived of bedding to prevent them from eating it. This dietary restriction completely distorts the normal development of the rumen and predisposes the calf to infectious enteritis (scouring or diarrhea) and chronic indigestion. Furthermore, calves with an underdeveloped gut are more likely to be found to have hairballs in the rumen at slaughter; the accumulation of hairballs in the rumen can impair digestion.\n\nRearing calves in deprived conditions without a teat can lead to the development of abnormal oral behaviour. Some of these may develop into oral stereotypies such as sucking, licking or biting inanimate objects, and by tongue rolling and tongue playing. \"Purposeless oral activity\" occupies 15% of the time in crated calves but only 2–3% in group-housed calves.\n\nVeal calves' dietary intake of iron is restricted to achieve a target haemoglobin concentration of around 4.6 mmol/l; normal concentration of haemoglobin in the blood is greater than 7 mmol/l. Calves with blood haemoglobin concentrations of below 4.5 mmol/l show clear signs of increased disease susceptibility and immunosuppression.\n\nAlternative agricultural uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal (slaughtered at two or three days old), raising calves as \"red veal\" without the severe dietary restrictions needed to create pale meat (requiring fewer antibiotic treatments and resulting in lower calf mortality), and as dairy beef.\n\nIn 2008 to 2009 in the US, the demand for free-raised veal rose rapidly.\n\nVeal crates are a close-confinement system of raising veal calves. Many calves raised for veal, including in Canada and the US, are confined in crates which typically measure approximately 66–76 cm (2.1-2.5 ft) wide. The calves are housed individually and the crates usually prevent physical contact between adjacent calves, and often prevent visual contact. Crated calves are sometimes tied to the front of the crate with a short tether which restricts almost all movement. Floors are often slatted and sloped. This allows urine and manure to fall under the crate to help maintain a clean environment for the calf. In some veal crate systems, the calves are also kept in the dark without bedding and fed nothing but milk. Veal crates are designed to limit movement of the animal because meat turns redder and tougher if the animals are allowed to exercise. The diet is sometimes highly regulated to remove sources of iron, which again makes the meat redder.\n\nIn the US, the use of crates to prevent movement by veal calves is a principal source of controversy in veal farming. Many veal farmers started improving conditions in their veal farms in the 2000s. Veal crating is criticized because the ability of the calves to move is highly restricted; the crates have unsuitable flooring; the calves spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged sensory, social, and exploratory deprivation; and the calves are more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.\n\nAbnormal bone and muscle development: Calves need to exercise to ensure normal bone and muscle development. Calves at pasture not only walk but also run about, jump and play. Calves in veal crates cannot turn around let alone walk or run. When finally taken out of their crates to go for slaughter, calves may stumble or have difficulty walking. There is a general increase in knee and hock swelling as crate width decreases.\n\nSocial deprivation: Under natural conditions calves continue to suckle 3 to 6 times a day for up to 5 months. Clearly, veal crates prevent this social interaction. Furthermore, many calves are reared in crates with solid walls that prevent visual or tactile contact with their neighbours. It has been shown that calves will work for social contact with other calves.\n\nTo maintain personal hygiene and help prevent disease, calves lick themselves to groom. Cattle naturally lick all the parts of their body they can reach, however, tethering prevents calves from licking the hind parts of their body. Excessive licking of the forelegs (another abnormal behaviour) is common in stall and tether systems.\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulations do not permit the use of hormones on veal calves for any reason. They do, however, approve the use of antibiotics in veal raising to treat or prevent disease.\n\nIn 2004, the USDA expressed concern that the use of illegal drugs might be widespread in the veal industry. In 2004, a USDA official found a lump on a veal calf in a Wisconsin veal farm, which turned out to be an illegal hormone implant. In 2004, the USDA stated \"Penicillin is not used in calf raising: tetracycline has been approved, but is not widely used.\"\n\nIn 1990, the British government banned transporting calves in close-confinement crates. Veal crates were banned across the EU in January 2007.\n\nVeal calf production, as such, is not allowed in many northern European countries, such as in Finland. In Finland, giving feed, drink or other nutrition which is known to be dangerous to an animal which is being cared for is prohibited, as well as failing to give nutrients the lack of which is known to cause the animal to fall ill. The Finnish Animal Welfare Act of 1996 and the Finnish Animal Welfare Decree of 1996 provided general guidelines for the housing and care of animals, and effectively banned veal crates in Finland. Veal crates are not specifically banned in Switzerland, but most calves are raised outdoors.\n\nIn 2007, the American Veal Association passed a resolution encouraging the entire industry to phase out crate-confinement of calves by 2017, a goal that was met by all milk-fed veal farmers.\n\n, eight U.S. states ban veal crates. Nationally, several large veal producers and the American Veal Association are also working to phase out the industry use of veal crates.\nState-by-state veal crate bans are as follows:\n\nCurrent active legislation in:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32593", "title": "Vegemite", "text": "Vegemite\n\nVegemite ( ) is a thick, black Australian food spread made from leftover brewers' yeast extract with various vegetable and spice additives. It was developed by Cyril Percy Callister in Melbourne, Victoria in 1922. The Vegemite brand was owned by Mondelez International (formerly Kraft Foods Inc.) until January 2017, when it was acquired by the Australian Bega Cheese group in a agreement for full Australian ownership after Bega would buy most of Mondelez International's Australia and New Zealand grocery and cheese business.\n\nA spread for sandwiches, toast, crumpets and cracker biscuits as well as a filling for pastries, Vegemite is similar to British Marmite, New Zealand Marmite, Australian Promite, MightyMite, AussieMite, OzEmite, German Vitam-R, and Swiss Cenovis.\n\nVegemite is salty, slightly bitter, malty, and rich in glutamates – giving it an umami flavour similar to beef bouillon. It is vegan, kosher, and halal.\n\nIn 1919, following the disruption of British Marmite imports after World War I and prior to the introduction of Vegemite, Callister's employer, the Australian company Fred Walker & Co., gave him the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by breweries. Callister had been hired by the chairman Fred Walker. Vegemite was registered as a trademark in Australia that same year. Callister used autolysis to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the Carlton & United brewery. Concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with salt, celery and onion extracts formed a sticky black paste.\nFollowing a competition to find a name for the new spread, the name \"Vegemite\" was selected by Fred Walker's daughter, Sheilah. Vegemite first appeared on the market in 1923 with advertising emphasising the value of Vegemite to children's health but failed to sell very well. Faced with growing competition from Marmite, from 1928 to 1935 the product was renamed as \"Parwill\" to make use of the advertising slogan \"Marmite but Parwill\", a convoluted pun on the new name and that of its competitor; \"If Ma [mother] might... then Pa [father] will.\" This attempt to expand market share was unsuccessful and the name was changed back to Vegemite, but did not recover lost market share.\n\nIn 1925, Walker had established the Kraft Walker Cheese Co. as a joint venture company with J.L. Kraft & Bros to market processed cheese and, following the failure of Parwill, in 1935 he used the success of Kraft Walker Cheese to promote Vegemite. In a two-year campaign to promote sales, Vegemite was given away free with Kraft Walker cheese products (with a coupon redemption) and this was followed by poetry competitions with imported American Pontiac cars being offered as prizes. Sales responded and in 1939 Vegemite was officially endorsed by the British Medical Association as a rich source of B vitamins. Rationed in Australia during World War II, Vegemite was included in Australian Army rations and by the late 1940s was used in nine out of ten Australian homes.\n\nIn April 1984, a jar of vegemite became the first product in Australia to be electronically scanned at a checkout.\n\nVegemite is produced in Australia at Bega Cheese's (formerly Mondelez's) Port Melbourne manufacturing facility, which produces more than 22 million jars per year. Virtually unchanged from Callister's original recipe, Vegemite now far outsells Marmite and other similar spreads in Australia. The billionth jar of Vegemite was produced in October 2008.\n\nVegemite was also produced in New Zealand for over 50 years, but as of August 2006 New Zealand production had ceased.\n\nA common way of eating Vegemite is on toasted bread with a layer of butter or margarine. Only a small amount of Vegemite is required due to its strong flavour. A Vegemite sandwich may consist of two slices of buttered bread, Vegemite, and cheese, but other ingredients such as lettuce, avocado and tomato can be added as well.\n\nVegemite can be used as a filling for pastries, such as the cheesymite scroll, or it may even be used in more exotic dishes.\n\nThe official Vegemite website contains several recipes using Vegemite in foods such as pasta, burgers, pizzas, casseroles and ice cream.\n\nLimited quantities of kosher Vegemite were first produced in the 1980s; a 2004 decision to cease certification was reversed after a backlash from Jewish consumers. Around 2009, Kraft contracted with the Kashrut Authority in New South Wales for their kashrut supervision services, and by 2010, all jars and tubes of ordinary Vegemite were labelled with the authority's stamp. In 2010, Vegemite also received halal certification.\n\nVegemite is one of the richest sources of B vitamins, specifically thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and folate (B1, B2, B3 & B9, respectively). Unlike Marmite and some other yeast extracts, the base version contains no vitamin B12 although both B6 and vitamin B12 are added to the low-salt formulation.\n\nThe main ingredient of Vegemite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid, the source of Vegemite's rich umami flavour. Vegemite does not contain any fat, added sugar or animal content. It contains gluten (a composite of storage proteins).\n\nVegemite contains 3.45% sodium, which equates to a salt content of approximately 8.6%. Australia only defines low salt foods, but by UK standards Vegemite is classified as a high salt content food.\n\nThe low-salt version of Vegemite with a distinctive pale orange lid was introduced to the Australian domestic market in September 2014, offering a 25% reduction in sodium content. The low-salt version is also fortified with vitamins B6 and vitamin B12.\n\nVegemite contains 2.3% potassium.\n\nOriginally promoted as a healthy food for children, during World War II advertising emphasised its medicinal value:\nVegemite fights with the men up north! If you are one of those who don't need Vegemite medicinally, then thousands of invalids are asking you to deny yourself of it for the time being.\nAt the same time, \"Sister MacDonald\" insisted that Vegemite was essential for \"infant welfare\" in magazines. Later advertisements began to promote the importance of the B complex vitamins to health.\n\nVegemite's rise to popularity was helped by the marketing campaigns written by J. Walter Thompson advertising that began in 1954, using groups of smiling, healthy children singing a catchy jingle titled \"We're happy little Vegemites\".\n\nFirst aired on radio in 1954, the jingle was transferred to television in 1956. This advertising campaign continued until the late 1960s but, as it was targeted to children, it was discontinued in favour of ads promoting the product to all ages. In the late 1980s the original black and white television commercial was remastered, partially colourised and reintroduced. This commercial was to be broadcast periodically from 1991 to 2010. The two young twin girls who sang this advertising jingle were known as the \"Vegemite Twins\".\n\nIn March 2007, Kraft announced that they were trying to trace the eight original children from the campaign to celebrate the advertisement's fiftieth anniversary and to take part in a new campaign. The 1956 commercial was to be remade with the original children, now grown, to forge a link between \"the new generation and the old ad\". The media took up the search on Kraft's behalf with all eight children identified in eight days and resulted in many TV specials and interviews in the Australian national media. The 50-year reunion campaign won the \"Arts, Entertainment & Media Campaign of the Year\" award at the November 2007 Asia Pacific PR Awards.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Kraft released a product in Australia known as Vegemite Singles. It combined two of Kraft's major products, Kraft Singles and Vegemite, into one, thus creating Vegemite-flavoured cheese. This extension of the Vegemite product line was an attempt by Kraft to capitalise on the enormous popularity of Vegemite and cheese sandwiches (made by placing a slice of cheese into a Vegemite sandwich). Vegemite Singles were later taken off the market.\n\nOn 13 June 2009, Kraft released a new version of Vegemite. The formula combines Vegemite and Kraft cream cheese, spreads more easily and has a considerably less salty and milder taste than the original. To coincide with the release of the new recipe, Kraft ran a competition to give the new flavour a name. The new name was announced during the broadcast of the 2009 AFL Grand Final as \"iSnack 2.0\". The name was chosen by a panel of marketing and communication experts to appeal to a younger market, capitalising on the popularity of Apple's iPod and iPhone. The choice immediately drew universal criticism and ridicule within Australia. Within days, opinion columns and social networking sites were flooded with derision and vitriol, and after only four days, Kraft released plans to abandon the \"iSnack\" name, admitting that it may have been a mistake. Two days later, Kraft opened a new poll on its website, and the final name was announced on 7 October 2009 as \"Vegemite Cheesybite\", with Kraft claiming that the name had received 36% of the 30,357 votes that were cast for a name option, or approximately 10,900 votes. It was noted that the popular suggestion \"Cheesymite\", long associated with the popular Cheesymite scroll, was already trademarked by other organisations.\n\nIn 2011, Kraft Foods Australia launched \"My First Vegemite\", a special formulation of original Vegemite for children aged older than one year. According to Kraft, the new formula has a \"milder taste\" and \"additional health benefits including iron, B6 and B12 vitamins as well as 50% less sodium\", and was designed in response to consumer demand for foods with lower sugar and salt content plus additional health benefits. Immediate reaction and media reports regarding the new formula were largely positive, but Kraft Foods Australia discontinued the \"My First Vegemite\" product line in 2012 due to poor sales performance.\n\nIn April 2015, Cadbury announced that it was to release a Vegemite-flavoured block of chocolate on 1 June. The chocolate block is Cadbury's Caramello block updated by mixing vegemite with the chocolate. Critics described the taste as similar to salted caramel with a pleasant umami aftertaste. Criticism varied from \"love it\" to tasting like a \"caramel and turkish delight filling with a lot of salt\" to \"needs more salt\" with several tasters commenting that they thought the aftertaste was unpleasant.\n\nIn 2017, a premium variety, Vegemite Blend 17, was released for a limited time. It promised a \"richer bolder taste\" but at double the price of the standard product.\n\nOther commercial products with Vegemite flavour include Smith's Crisps, In a Biskit, bagel crisps, sausages and meat pies.\n\nIn October 2006, an Australian news company reported that Vegemite had been banned in the United States, and that the United States Customs Service had gone so far as to search Australians entering the country for Vegemite because it naturally contains folate, a B vitamin approved as an additive in the United States for just a few foods, including breakfast cereals. The story appears to have originated as an anecdote by a traveller who claimed to have been searched by U.S. Customs and a spokesperson for Kraft made a misinformed comment to reporters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later stated that there were no plans to subject Vegemite to an import ban, or withdraw it from supermarket shelves. The United States Customs and Border Protection tried to dispel the rumour, stating on its website that \"there is no known prohibition on the importation of Vegemite\" and \"there is no official policy within CBP targeting Vegemite for interception\". The story of the \"ban\" later took on the status of urban legend. While Vegemite has never been popular in the US, it can still be purchased at supermarkets that stock imported food items.\n\nFollowing newspaper reports in May 2011 that Vegemite and Marmite had been banned and were being removed from shelves in Denmark, outraged fans set up several Facebook groups. In response, Denmark's Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries stated that neither spread had been banned but that the respective companies had not applied for licences to market their products in Denmark. In 2004 Denmark had passed legislation prohibiting the sale of food products fortified with vitamins as a danger to health.\n\nVegemite is banned from Victorian prisons, with the bans beginning to come into effect from the 1990s, to prevent inmates from brewing alcohol using the paste's high yeast content, despite the fact that Vegemite contains no live yeast. Similar bans were proposed in 2015 for a number of dry communities in outback Australia, but were not enacted.\n\nThe Australian rock band Men at Work refer to a \"Vegemite sandwich\" in the second verse of their 1981 hit song \"Down Under\", from their debut album \"Business as Usual\". Vegemite was mentioned in the original version of John Williamson's song \"True Blue\". He removed the reference in a later version of the song because Vegemite was not Australian-owned. According to Williamson's web site, it was \"carelessly sold off ('like sponge cake') to the multi-national Kraft\". Two song titles from Amanda Palmer's 2011 album \"Amanda Palmer Goes Down Under\" reference the product: \"We're Happy Little Vegemites\" and \"Vegemite (The Black Death)\". Australian rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have a song named \"Vegemite\" in their album Oddments.\n\nMem Fox in 1983 wrote the children's book Possum Magic. The story involves an invisible possum who needs to eat Australian foods in order to become visible again. Among these foods is a Vegemite sandwich.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama, in response to a question in March 2011 during a joint visit with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to a high school in Virginia, gave his impression of Vegemite by stating \"It's horrible\". Following a description by Gillard, he said: \"So, it's like a quasi-vegetable by-product paste that you smear on your toast for breakfast – sounds good, doesn't it?\"\n\nDuring a rain delay in the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway, Australian race car driver and pole sitter Marcos Ambrose gave Vegemite sandwiches to the NASCAR on TNT commentary team. After taking his first bite, Kyle Petty commented: \"He may be the fastest man on the racetrack. I may be the fastest man on TV headed for the bathroom.\" Larry McReynolds followed it up by saying: \"Oh, my God. Are you sure this is edible? God! I need Sani-Flush or somethin'.\"\n\nIn a 2013 episode of his show, Steve Harvey was offered a jar of Vegemite by an Australian audience member. After tasting a small amount of it, he stated: \"Vegemite sounds like a pesticide. That's about damn near what it tastes like.\"\n\nHugh Jackman demonstrated how to correctly spread Vegemite on the U.S. talk show \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\".\n\nTerry Pratchett's Discworld book \"The Last Continent\" features Rincewind the wizard accidentally inventing a substance very similar to Vegemite, which proves to be very popular with the citizens of XXXX (the Discworld equivalent of Australia).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32617", "title": "Victoria Bitter", "text": "Victoria Bitter\n\nVictoria Bitter (VB) is a lager produced by Carlton & United Breweries, a subsidiary of Foster's Group in Melbourne, Victoria. It was first brewed by Thomas Aitken at Victoria Brewery in 1854, and is a Victorian beer. It is one of the highest selling beers in Australia.\n\nThe origins of Victoria Bitter (VB) date back to Victoria Brewery founder and head brewer Thomas Aitken, who developed the recipe in 1854. Like most Australian lagers, VB is made using a wortstream brewing process, and uses a portion of cane sugar to thin out the body of the beer.\n\nIt is available in 750 mL bottles (commonly referred to as a \"Long-neck\", a \"Seven-fifty\" or a \"Bomber\"), 500 mL cans (Lunch greens), 375 mL bottles (\"Stubbies\", a \"Pint\" or \"Short-neck\"), 375 mL cans (\"Boonies\", \"Green Cans\" or \"Gweens\"), and 250 mL bottles (\"Grenades\", \"Twisties\" or \"Throwies\"). For a limited time only, VB was available in the Northern Territory in a 1-litre can nicknamed a 'Killer can' (Kilo can). As with all packaged beer sold in Australia it was for many years only available in 750 mL or 26 2/3 fl oz (1/6 imperial gallon) bottles, until the introduction of \"stubbies\" and smaller cans. In a testament to its long history and popularity, VB has acquired a number of nicknames, ranging from the abbreviated \"Vic Bitter\", \"Veebs\", polite \"Very Best\", \"Vitamin B\" and \"Victory Beer\", for after a win in the footy. People who dislike the beer may refer to it as \"Vomit Beer\", \"Vaginal Backwash\", or \"Visitors Beer\".\n\nThe beer began to gain wide popularity in the mid 1960s with an innovative television advertising campaign featuring a very similar recording of the theme from the film \"The Magnificent Seven\", images of working-class Australians at work and play, and a voice-over by notable Australian actor John Meillon. The campaign was used until quite recently and was reinvented in 2018 with the launch of the ‘New Knock Off Times’ Campaign. In 2004, VB commanded more than 25 per cent market share, meaning that one in four beers sold in Australia was a VB.\n\nIn July 2007 Foster's announced it would cut the alcohol content of VB from 4.9% to 4.8% in a bid to save millions of dollars in tax payments. The brewer cut the alcohol percentage of VB further in 2009, reducing it to 4.6% in an effort to make further savings. On 3 September 2012, CUB announced VB would be going back to its original 4.9% alcohol recipe and its original packaging. CUB had received many complaints since it was changed to 4.6% in 2009, and the beer had lost a large amount of market share. The updated VBs began rolling out in late October 2012. As of 2013, VB was the most popular beer in Australia, with 12.2 per cent market share.\n\nAccording to ACNielsen in 2009 Victoria Bitter was claimed to be Australia's only billion dollar retail beer brand, selling the equivalent of one slab every second. At one time VB sold twice as much as any other full strength beer and was the only Australian beer brand that is in the top 3 sellers in every state. Victoria Bitter held the highest market share of all beer sold in Australia for more than two decades, but in 2012 lost this position to XXXX Gold.\n\nIn April 2011 VB held 13.7% volume share and XXXX Gold had 11.7%. Just one year on in April 2012 VB had dropped to 12.3%, while XXXX Gold took the lead with 12.4%.\n\nIn addition to being sold in Australia, Victoria Bitter is also available in New Zealand, Bali, Indonesia, the UK, and, to a limited extent, other countries abroad. When the joint venture Angkor Brewing Co. was established in Cambodia in 1992, VB was briefly brewed in Sihanoukville, and later imported; it held a significant share of the premium beer market until 1994.\n\nDespite its name, Victoria Bitter is a standard commercial lager rather than a bitter. Since late 2012, Victoria Bitter has been sold at a strength of 4.9% ABV after an interim period of producing the same product at an ABV of 4.6% (equal to virtually every other major Australian lager). The VB sold commercially in New Zealand is both 4.9% and 4.6% available in 375ml quantities in either bottles or cans.\n\nIn 2007, Foster's launched a new, midstrength version of VB called VB Midstrength Lager with an alcohol volume of 3.5%, in order to capitalise on the growing market for midstrength beers, currently dominated by XXXX Gold. In May 2007, The launch was Foster's first ever mainstream variation of the VB brand. In 2009, Carlton & United Breweries re-branded VB Midstrength to the new name VB Gold and in 2017 reduced the alcohol content to 3%.\n\nTV builder Scott Cam, a self-confessed VB fan, is the appointed VB Mid Ambassador.\n\nOn 24 July 2007, The Australian reported that within three months of Fosters launching VB Midstrength, market share for the full strength VB and mid VB had increased. Foster's regional marketing director Anthony Heraghty hinted at further VB brand extensions, saying Foster's was \"\"trying to see past the big green giant\"\".\n\nDuring the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, VB Gold was advertised on TV by Australian Rugby League legends Wally Lewis and Gorden Tallis.\n\nIn September 2009 CUB released VB RAW to compete in the low carb market. The alcohol volume was 4.5%. VB Raw was discontinued in late 2010 due to poor sales.\n\nIn 2009, Foster's replaced the slogan from the '60s \"A hard earned thirst needs a big cold beer, and the best cold beer is Vic, Victoria Bitter\" with \"VB – The Drinking Beer\" as part of a marketing strategy to reposition VB to a broader range of drinkers. The new slogan, as part of a campaign called \"The Regulars\" included a brand website for the first time, including a production line live webcam. Advertising ran on TV and radio, in print, outdoor, online and at point of sale. In 2015, Carlton and United Breweries revived the \"hard earned thirst\" campaign.\nIn 2018 Victoria Bitter revisited the idea of knock off with the launch of a new campaign called new knock off times expanding its brand positioning to celebrate Australia's changing workforce.\nMarking its 50th anniversary of TV advertising, the ad celebrates the change in Australia's workforce that's taken place over the half century. These days, there's no one time that people knock off. 4.00pm might still be the end of the day for some, but for others, it might very well be the beginning of their day.\n\nIn 2005, VB had started a promotion where David Boon became the face of Victoria Bitter (VB) beer for its 2005/06 summer advertising campaign, called \"Boonanza\". Part of the promotion was the sale of a talking David Boon figurine with purchases of cartons of beer, which would make comments when prompted by Channel Nine commentary. In late 2006, the \"Boonanza\" promotion returned as \"Boonanza II\" for the 2006-07 Ashes series. The promotion included former England cricket captain Ian Botham as a talking figure, who would interact alongside an updated David Boon figure.\n\nFor the 2007-08 Australian cricket series, Shane Warne took over as VB spokesperson from David Boon. Warne also had a talking figurine as part of a \"Warnie\" promotion, taking over from the highly successful \"Talking Boony\" dolls from the two previous \"Boonanza\" promotions.\n\nOn 6 July 2011, Foster's released VB packaged in limited edition 1958 heritage cans. The packaging had the original artwork of the 1958 VB product, but also included a standard ring pull on each can, something which was lacking on the original.\n\nVB has invested heavily in sponsorships of Australian rugby league. It is currently the official beer of the NRL, the naming rights sponsor for NRL Friday Night Football and the main sponsor of the Australian national rugby league team, the Kangaroos.\n\nVictoria Bitter was also the main sponsor of the Australian Tri-Series for five years between 2001–02 and 2005–06. During this time the series was renamed \"The VB Series\".\n\nVictoria Bitter were sponsors the away Test, ODI and Twenty20 teams for the Australia national cricket team from 2008 tountil 2014. In 2013, Cricket Australia agreed to remove the logo of Muslim cricketer Fawad Ahmed's uniform due to his faith's ban on alcohol.\n\nThe previous advertising campaign was called the Stubby Symphony, where 100 members of the Melbourne and Victorian orchestras play the theme from \"The Magnificent Seven\" only using VB beer bottles. The campaign was created by George Patterson Y&R in Melbourne.\n\nVB launched a new advertising campaign in Australia in July 2009 to coincide with the SBS television broadcast of the 2009 The Ashes cricket series. They will drop the famous tag \"\"For a hard earned thirst..\"\" for \"\"VB – The Drinking Beer\"\".\n\nVB and the iconic slogan \"A big cold beer needs a big cold drink, and the best cold beer is...\" are mentioned in the ramp up of \"There Goes God\" from the 10th Anniversary Edition of the live album \"Farewell to the World\" by Crowded House which was recorded at Sydney Opera House on 24 November 1996.\n\nIn an interview, Ex-The Distillers singer/guitarist, Brody Dalle said that Victoria Bitter was all her and her bandmates drank during their time in Australia.\n\nVB is mentioned in \"I Was Only Nineteen\", the #1 single by Redgum from the 1983 album \"Caught in the Act\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32653", "title": "Vaccine", "text": "Vaccine\n\nA vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).\n\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world.\nThe effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, vaccines that have proven effective include the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available for twenty-five different preventable infections.\n\nThe terms \"vaccine\" and \"vaccination\" are derived from \"Variolae vaccinae\" (smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Edward Jenner to denote cowpox. He used it in 1798 in the long title of his \"Inquiry into the Variolae vaccinae known as the Cow Pox\", in which he described the protective effect of cowpox against smallpox. In 1881, to honor Jenner, Louis Pasteur proposed that the terms should be extended to cover the new protective inoculations then being developed.\n\nVaccines have historically been the most effective means to fight and eradicate infectious diseases. Limitations to their effectiveness, nevertheless, exist. Sometimes, protection fails because the host's immune system simply does not respond adequately or at all. Lack of response commonly results from clinical factors such as diabetes, steroid use, HIV infection, or age. It also might fail for genetic reasons if the host's immune system includes no strains of B cells that can generate antibodies suited to reacting effectively and binding to the antigens associated with the pathogen.\n\nEven if the host does develop antibodies, protection might not be adequate; immunity might develop too slowly to be effective in time, the antibodies might not disable the pathogen completely, or there might be multiple strains of the pathogen, not all of which are equally susceptible to the immune reaction. However, even a partial, late, or weak immunity, such as a one resulting from cross-immunity to a strain other than the target strain, may mitigate an infection, resulting in a lower mortality rate, lower morbidity, and faster recovery.\n\nAdjuvants commonly are used to boost immune response, particularly for older people (50–75 years and up), whose immune response to a simple vaccine may have weakened.\n\nThe efficacy or performance of the vaccine is dependent on a number of factors:\n\nIf a vaccinated individual does develop the disease vaccinated against (breakthrough infection), the disease is likely to be less virulent than in unvaccinated victims.\n\nThe following are important considerations in the effectiveness of a vaccination program:\n\nIn 1958, there were 763,094 cases of measles in the United States; 552 deaths resulted. After the introduction of new vaccines, the number of cases dropped to fewer than 150 per year (median of 56). In early 2008, there were 64 suspected cases of measles. Fifty-four of those infections were associated with importation from another country, although only 13% were actually acquired outside the United States; 63 of the 64 individuals either had never been vaccinated against measles or were uncertain whether they had been vaccinated.\n\nVaccines have contributed to the eradication of smallpox, one of the most contagious and deadly diseases in humans. Other diseases such as rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and typhoid are nowhere near as common as they were a hundred years ago. As long as the vast majority of people are vaccinated, it is much more difficult for an outbreak of disease to occur, let alone spread. This effect is called herd immunity. Polio, which is transmitted only between humans, is targeted by an extensive eradication campaign that has seen endemic polio restricted to only parts of three countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan). However, the difficulty of reaching all children as well as cultural misunderstandings have caused the anticipated eradication date to be missed several times.\n\nVaccines also help prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. For example, by greatly reducing the incidence of pneumonia caused by \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", vaccine programs have greatly reduced the prevalence of infections resistant to penicillin or other first-line antibiotics.\n\nVaccination given during childhood is generally safe. Adverse effects if any are generally mild. The rate of side effects depends on the vaccine in question. Some common side effects include fever, pain around the injection site, and muscle aches. Additionally, some individuals may be allergic to ingredients in the vaccine. MMR vaccine is rarely associated with febrile seizures.\n\nSevere side effects are extremely rare. Varicella vaccine is rarely associated with complications in immunodeficient individuals and rotavirus vaccines are moderately associated with intussusception.\n\nSome countries such as the United Kingdom provide compensation for victims of severe adverse effects via its Vaccine Damage Payment. The United States has the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. At least 19 countries have such no-fault compensation.\n\nVaccines are dead or inactivated organisms or purified products derived from them.\n\nThere are several types of vaccines in use. These represent different strategies used to try to reduce the risk of illness while retaining the ability to induce a beneficial immune response.\n\nSome vaccines contain inactivated, but previously virulent, micro-organisms that have been destroyed with chemicals, heat, or radiation. Examples include the polio vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, rabies vaccine and some influenza vaccines.\n\nSome vaccines contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many of these are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella, and the bacterial disease typhoid. The live \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain but contains a virulently modified strain called \"BCG\" used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain \"Yersinia pestis\" EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. But they may not be safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and on rare occasions mutate to a virulent form and cause disease.\n\nToxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. Toxoid vaccines are known for their efficacy. Not all toxoids are for micro-organisms; for example, \"Crotalus atrox\" toxoid is used to vaccinate dogs against rattlesnake bites.\n\nProtein subunit – rather than introducing an inactivated or attenuated micro-organism to an immune system (which would constitute a \"whole-agent\" vaccine), a fragment of it can create an immune response. Examples include the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus that is composed of only the surface proteins of the virus (previously extracted from the blood serum of chronically infected patients, but now produced by recombination of the viral genes into yeast) or as an edible algae vaccine, the virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) that is composed of the viral major capsid protein, and the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits of the influenza virus. Subunit vaccine is being used for plague immunization.\n\nConjugate – certain bacteria have polysaccharide outer coats that are poorly immunogenic. By linking these outer coats to proteins (e.g., toxins), the immune system can be led to recognize the polysaccharide as if it were a protein antigen. This approach is used in the \"Haemophilus influenzae\" type B vaccine.\n\nA number of innovative vaccines are also in development and in use:\n\nWhile most vaccines are created using inactivated or attenuated compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic vaccines are composed mainly or wholly of synthetic peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens.\n\nVaccines may be \"monovalent\" (also called \"univalent\") or \"multivalent\" (also called \"polyvalent\"). A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A multivalent or polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms. The valency of a multivalent vaccine may be denoted with a Greek or Latin prefix (e.g., \"tetravalent\" or \"quadrivalent\"). In certain cases, a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response.\n\nAlso known as heterologous or \"Jennerian\" vaccines, these are vaccines that are pathogens of other animals that either do not cause disease or cause mild disease in the organism being treated. The classic example is Jenner's use of cowpox to protect against smallpox. A current example is the use of BCG vaccine made from Mycobacterium bovis to protect against human tuberculosis.\n\nVarious fairly standardized abbreviations for vaccine names have developed, although the standardization is by no means centralized or global. For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page. The page explains that \"The abbreviations [in] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ACIP Work Groups, the editor of the \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\" (MMWR), the editor of \"Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases\" (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP.\" Some examples are \"DTaP\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, \"DT\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and \"Td\" for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. At its page on tetanus vaccination, the CDC further explains that \"Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\" Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called \"Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations\", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records. The United States Adopted Name system has some conventions for the word order of vaccine names, placing head nouns first and adjectives postpositively. This is why the USAN for \"OPV\" is \"poliovirus vaccine live oral\" rather than \"oral poliovirus vaccine\".\n\nThe immune system recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the virulent version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\n\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin polio vaccine, where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine. This phenomenon has also been found to be a problem with the dengue vaccines currently being researched, where the DEN-3 serotype was found to predominate and suppress the response to DEN-1, −2 and −4 serotypes.\n\nVaccines typically contain one or more adjuvants, used to boost the immune response. Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto alum. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.\n\nIn the preparation for the 1990 Persian Gulf campaign, whole cell pertussis vaccine was used as an adjuvant for anthrax vaccine. This produces a more rapid immune response than giving only the anthrax vaccine, which is of some benefit if exposure might be imminent.\n\nVaccines may also contain preservatives to prevent contamination with bacteria or fungi. Until recent years, the preservative thimerosal was used in many vaccines that did not contain live virus. As of 2005, the only childhood vaccine in the U.S. that contains thimerosal in greater than trace amounts is the influenza vaccine, which is currently recommended only for children with certain risk factors. Single-dose influenza vaccines supplied in the UK do not list thiomersal (its UK name) in the ingredients. Preservatives may be used at various stages of production of vaccines, and the most sophisticated methods of measurement might detect traces of them in the finished product, as they may in the environment and population as a whole.\n\nIn order to provide the best protection, children are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional \"booster\" shots often required to achieve \"full immunity\". This has led to the development of complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. A large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.\n\nBesides recommendations for infant vaccinations and boosters, many specific vaccines are recommended for other ages or for repeated injections throughout life—most commonly for measles, tetanus, influenza, and pneumonia. Pregnant women are often screened for continued resistance to rubella. The human papillomavirus vaccine is recommended in the U.S. (as of 2011) and UK (as of 2009). Vaccine recommendations for the elderly concentrate on pneumonia and influenza, which are more deadly to that group. In 2006, a vaccine was introduced against shingles, a disease caused by the chickenpox virus, which usually affects the elderly.\n\nPrior to the introduction of vaccination with material from cases of cowpox (heterotypic immunisation), smallpox could be prevented by deliberate inoculation of smallpox virus, later referred to as variolation to distinguish it from smallpox vaccination. The earliest hints of the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century. The Chinese also practiced the oldest documented use of variolation, dating back to the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of \"nasal insufflation\" administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China.\nTwo reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.\n\nSometime during the late 1760s whilst serving his apprenticeship as a surgeon/apothecary Edward Jenner learned of the story, common in rural areas, that dairy workers would never have the often-fatal or disfiguring disease smallpox, because they had already had cowpox, which has a very mild effect in humans. In 1796, Jenner took pus from the hand of a milkmaid with cowpox, scratched it into the arm of an 8-year-old boy, James Phipps, and six weeks later inoculated (variolated) the boy with smallpox, afterwards observing that he did not catch smallpox. Jenner extended his studies and in 1798 reported that his vaccine was safe in children and adults and could be transferred from arm-to-arm reducing reliance on uncertain supplies from infected cows. Since vaccination with cowpox was much safer than smallpox inoculation, the latter, though still widely practised in England, was banned in 1840.\nThe second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax, and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.\n\nThe twentieth century saw the introduction of several successful vaccines, including those against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. Major achievements included the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s and the eradication of smallpox during the 1960s and 1970s. Maurice Hilleman was the most prolific of the developers of the vaccines in the twentieth century. As vaccines became more common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including herpes simplex, malaria, gonorrhea, and HIV.\n\nOne challenge in vaccine development is economic: Many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine, including HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, exist principally in poor countries. Pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases, because there is little revenue potential. Even in more affluent countries, financial returns are usually minimal and the financial and other risks are great.\n\nMost vaccine development to date has relied on \"push\" funding by government, universities and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost effective and beneficial for public health. The number of vaccines actually administered has risen dramatically in recent decades. This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines administered to children before entry into schools may be due to government mandates and support, rather than economic incentive.\n\nThe filing of patents on vaccine development processes can also be viewed as an obstacle to the development of new vaccines. Because of the weak protection offered through a patent on the final product, the protection of the innovation regarding vaccines is often made through the patent of processes used in the development of new vaccines as well as the protection of secrecy.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the biggest barrier to local vaccine production in less developed countries has not been patents, but the substantial financial, infrastructure, and workforce expertise requirements needed for market entry. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R&D infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.\n\nVaccine production has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., \"Haemophilus influenzae\" type b). Likewise, a recombinant protein derived from the viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus may need to be inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.\n\nVaccine production techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells are expected to become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically detoxified vaccine is expected to grow in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.\n\nIn 2010, India produced 60 percent of the world's vaccine worth about $900 million(€670 million).\n\nBeside the active vaccine itself, the following excipients and residual manufacturing compounds are present or may be present in vaccine preparations:\n\nMany vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as \"Staphylococcus\" infection, which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative. Several preservatives are available, including thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, has a better shelf-life, and improves vaccine stability, potency, and safety; but, in the U.S., the European Union, and a few other affluent countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines, as a precautionary measure due to its mercury content. Although controversial claims have been made that thiomersal contributes to autism, no convincing scientific evidence supports these claims. Furthermore, a 10–11 year study of 657,461 children found that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism and actually reduced the risk of autism by 7 percent.\n\nThe development of new delivery systems raises the hope of vaccines that are safer and more efficient to deliver and administer. Lines of research include liposomes and \"ISCOM\" (immune stimulating complex).\n\nNotable developments in vaccine delivery technologies have included oral vaccines. Early attempts to apply oral vaccines showed varying degrees of promise, beginning early in the 20th century, at a time when the very possibility of an effective oral antibacterial vaccine was controversial. By the 1930s there was increasing interest in the prophylactic value of an oral typhoid fever vaccine for example.\n\nAn oral polio vaccine turned out to be effective when vaccinations were administered by volunteer staff without formal training; the results also demonstrated increased ease and efficiency of administering the vaccines. Effective oral vaccines have many advantages; for example, there is no risk of blood contamination. Vaccines intended for oral administration need not be liquid, and as solids, they commonly are more stable and less prone to damage or to spoilage by freezing in transport and storage. Such stability reduces the need for a \"cold chain\": the resources required to keep vaccines within a restricted temperature range from the manufacturing stage to the point of administration, which, in turn, may decrease costs of vaccines.\n\nA microneedle approach, which is still in stages of development, uses \"pointed projections fabricated into arrays that can create vaccine delivery pathways through the skin\".\n\nAn experimental needle-free vaccine delivery system is undergoing animal testing. A stamp-size patch similar to an adhesive bandage contains about 20,000 microscopic projections per square cm. This dermal administration potentially increases the effectiveness of vaccination, while requiring less vaccine than injection.\n\nThe use of plasmids has been validated in preclinical studies as a protective vaccine strategy for cancer and infectious diseases. However, in human studies, this approach has failed to provide clinically relevant benefit. The overall efficacy of plasmid DNA immunization depends on increasing the plasmid's immunogenicity while also correcting for factors involved in the specific activation of immune effector cells.\n\nVaccinations of animals are used both to prevent their contracting diseases and to prevent transmission of disease to humans. Both animals kept as pets and animals raised as livestock are routinely vaccinated. In some instances, wild populations may be vaccinated. This is sometimes accomplished with vaccine-laced food spread in a disease-prone area and has been used to attempt to control rabies in raccoons.\n\nWhere rabies occurs, rabies vaccination of dogs may be required by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.\n\nCases of veterinary vaccines used in humans have been documented, whether intentional or accidental, with some cases of resultant illness, most notably with brucellosis. However, the reporting of such cases is rare and very little has been studied about the safety and results of such practices. With the advent of aerosol vaccination in veterinary clinics for companion animals, human exposure to pathogens that are not naturally carried in humans, such as Bordetella bronchiseptica, has likely increased in recent years. In some cases, most notably rabies, the parallel veterinary vaccine against a pathogen may be as much as orders of magnitude more economical than the human one.\n\nDIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals.\n\nDIVA vaccines carry at least one epitope less than the microorganisms circulating in the field. An accompanying diagnostic test that detects antibody against that epitope allows us to actually make that differentiation.\n\nThe first DIVA vaccines (formerly termed marker vaccines and since 1999 coined as DIVA vaccines) and companion diagnostic tests have been developed by\nJ.T. van Oirschot and colleagues at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, The Netherlands.\n\nThey found that some existing vaccines against pseudorabies (also termed Aujeszky's disease) had deletions in their viral genome (among which the gE gene). Monoclonal antibodies were produced against that deletion and selected to develop an ELISA that demonstrated antibodies against gE. In addition, novel genetically engineered gE-negative vaccines were constructed.\nAlong the same lines, DIVA vaccines and companion diagnostic tests against bovine herpesvirus 1 infections have been developed.\n\nThe DIVA strategy has been applied in various countries and successfully eradicated pseudorabies virus. Swine populations were intensively vaccinated and monitored by the companion diagnostic test and, subsequently, the infected pigs were removed from the population. Bovine herpesvirus 1 DIVA vaccines are also widely used in practice.\n\nScientists have put and still, are putting much effort in applying the DIVA principle to a wide range of infectious diseases, such as, for example, classical swine fever, avian influenza, Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia and Salmonella infections in pigs.\n\nVaccine development has several trends:\nPrinciples that govern the immune response can now be used in tailor-made vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure. Factors that affect the trends of vaccine development include progress in translatory medicine, demographics, regulatory science, political, cultural, and social responses.\n\nTransgenic plants have been identified as promising expression systems for vaccine production. Complex plants such as tobacco, potato, tomato, and banana can have genes inserted that cause them to produce vaccines usable for humans. Bananas have been developed that produce a human vaccine against hepatitis B. Another example is the expression of a fusion protein in alfalfa transgenic plants for the selective directioning to antigen presenting cells, therefore increasing vaccine potency against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV).\n\n"}

Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and fruit wines such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, currant and elderberry.\n\nWine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest known traces of wine are from Georgia ( BC), Iran ( BC), and Sicily ( BC) although there is evidence of a similar alcoholic drink being consumed earlier in China ( BC). The earliest known winery is the 6,100-year-old Areni-1 winery in Armenia. Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout history, wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.\n\nWine has long played an important role in religion. Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in the Eucharist.\n\nThe earliest archaeological and archaeobotanical evidence for grape wine and viniculture, dating to 6000–5800 BC was found on the territory of modern Georgia. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine elsewhere was relatively later, likely having taken place in the Southern Caucasus (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region between Eastern Turkey, and northern Iran.\n\nThe earliest evidence of a grape-based fermented drink was found in China ( BC), Georgia from 6000 BC, Iran from 5000 BC, and Sicily from 4000 BC. The earliest evidence of a wine production facility is the Areni-1 winery in Armenia and is at least 6100 years old.\n\nA 2003 report by archaeologists indicates a possibility that grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented drinks in China in the early years of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out. If these drinks, which seem to be the precursors of rice wine, included grapes rather than other fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous wild species in China, rather than \"Vitis vinifera\", which was introduced there 6000 years later.\n\nThe spread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the Phoenicians who spread outward from a base of city-states along the Mediterranean coast of what are today Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine. The wines of Byblos were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean. Evidence includes two Phoenician shipwrecks from 750 BC discovered by Robert Ballard, whose cargo of wine was still intact. As the first great traders in wine (\"cherem\"), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from oxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin, similar to retsina. Although the nuragic Sardinians already consumed wine before the arrival of the Phoenicians\nThe earliest remains of Apadana Palace in Persepolis dating back to 515 BC include carvings depicting soldiers from Achaemenid Empire subject nations bringing gifts to the Achaemenid king, among them Armenians bringing their famous wine.\n\nLiterary references to wine are abundant in Homer (8th century BC, but possibly relating earlier compositions), Alkman (7th century BC), and others. In ancient Egypt, six of 36 wine amphoras were found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun bearing the name \"Kha'y\", a royal chief vintner. Five of these amphoras were designated as originating from the king's personal estate, with the sixth from the estate of the royal house of Aten. Traces of wine have also been found in central Asian Xinjiang in modern-day China, dating from the second and first millennia BC.\n\nThe first known mention of grape-based wines in India is from the late 4th-century BC writings of Chanakya, the chief minister of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya. In his writings, Chanakya condemns the use of alcohol while chronicling the emperor and his court's frequent indulgence of a style of wine known as \"madhu\".\n\nThe ancient Romans planted vineyards near garrison towns so wine could be produced locally rather than shipped over long distances. Some of these areas are now world-renowned for wine production. The Romans discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels kept them fresh and free from a vinegar smell. In medieval Europe, the Roman Catholic Church supported wine because the clergy required it for the Mass. Monks in France made wine for years, aging it in caves. An old English recipe that survived in various forms until the 19th century calls for refining white wine from bastard—bad or tainted \"bastardo\" wine.\n\nThe English word \"wine\" comes from the Proto-Germanic \"*winam\", an early borrowing from the Latin \"vinum\", \"wine\" or \"(grape) vine\", itself derived from the Proto-Indo-European stem *\"win-o-\" (cf. , \"gini\"; Ancient Greek: \"oinos\"; Aeolic Greek: \"woinos\"; Hittite: \"wiyana\"; Lycian: \"oino\"). The earliest attested terms referring to wine are the Mycenaean Greek \"me-tu-wo ne-wo\" (*), meaning \"in (the month)\" or \"(festival) of the new wine\", and \"wo-no-wa-ti-si\", meaning \"wine garden\", written in Linear B inscriptions. Linear B also includes, inter alia, an ideogram for wine, i.e. .\n\nUltimate Indo-European origin of the word is the subject of continued debate. Some scholars have noted the similarities between the words for wine in Indo-European languages (e.g. Armenian \"gini\", Latin \"vinum\", Ancient Greek οἶνος, Russian вино ), Kartvelian (e.g. Georgian ღვინო ), and Semitic (\"*wayn\"; Hebrew יין ), pointing to the possibility of a common origin of the word denoting \"wine\" in these language families. The Georgian word goes back to Proto-Kartvelian *\"ɣwino\"-, which is either a borrowing from Proto-Indo-European or the lexeme was specifically borrowed from Proto-Armenian *\"ɣʷeinyo\"-, whence Armenian \"gini\". An alternate hypothesis by Fähnrich supposes *\"ɣwino\"- a native Kartvelian word derived from the verbal root *\"ɣun\"- ('to bend'). See *\"ɣwino\"- for more. All these theories place the origin of the word in the same geographical location, Trans-Caucasia, that has been established based on archeological and biomolecular studies as the origin of viticulture.\n\nThe red-wine production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. Red wine is made from dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is actually greenish-white; the red color comes from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which actually have red flesh and produce red juice.\n\nFermentation of the non-colored grape pulp produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these. Dark-skinned grapes may be used to produce white wine if the wine-maker is careful not to let the skin stain the wort during the separation of the pulp-juice. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.\n\nDry (non-sweet) white wine is the most common, derived from the complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines are produced when the fermentation is interrupted before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white wines, are produced by not allowing carbon dioxide from the fermentation to escape during fermentation, which takes place in the bottle rather than in the barrel.\n\nA rosé wine incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling, or sparkling, with a wide range of sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.\n\nWines from other fruits, such as apples and berries, are usually named after the fruit from which they are produced combined with the word \"wine\" (for example, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine or country wine (not to be confused with the French term \"vin de pays\"). Other than the grape varieties traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.\n\nMead, also called honey wine, is created by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. As long as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead. Mead was produced in ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia, and was known in Europe before grape wine.\n\nOther drinks called \"wine\", such as barley wine and rice wine (e.g. sake), are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer more than traditional wine, while ginger wine is fortified with brandy. In these latter cases, the term \"wine\" refers to the similarity in alcohol content rather than to the production process. The commercial use of the English word \"wine\" (and its equivalent in other languages) is protected by law in many jurisdictions.\n\nSome UK supermarkets have been criticised for selling “wine based” drinks, which only contain 75% wine, but which are still marketed as wine. The International Organisation of Vine and Wine requires that a \"wine based drink\" must contain a minimum of 75% wine, but producers do not have to divulge the nature of the remaining 25%.\n\nWine is usually made from one or more varieties of the European species \"Vitis vinifera\", such as Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay and Merlot. When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a \"varietal\" as opposed to a \"blended\" wine. Blended wines are not necessarily inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of wine-making.\n\nWine can also be made from other species of grape or from hybrids, created by the genetic crossing of two species. \"V. labrusca\" (of which the Concord grape is a cultivar), \"V. aestivalis\", \"V. rupestris\", \"V. rotundifolia\" and \"V. riparia\" are native North American grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.\n\nHybridization is different from grafting. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European \"V. vinifera\" vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to phylloxera, a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in Argentina, the Canary Islands and Chile—the only places not yet exposed to the insect.\n\nIn the context of wine production, \"terroir\" is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma and taste influences of their unique \"terroir\". However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production techniques such as micro-oxygenation, tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film evaporation,\nand spinning cones.\n\nRegulations govern the classification and sale of wine in many regions of the world. European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. Bordeaux, Rioja and Chianti), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. Pinot noir and Merlot). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include Napa Valley, Santa Clara Valley, Sonoma Valley, Anderson Valley, and Mendocino County in California; Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley in Oregon; Columbia Valley in Washington; Barossa Valley in South Australia; Hunter Valley in New South Wales; Luján de Cuyo in Argentina; Central Valley in Chile; Vale dos Vinhedos in Brazil; Hawke's Bay and Marlborough in New Zealand; and in Canada, the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, and the Niagara Peninsula and Essex County regions of Ontario are the three largest producers.\n\nSome blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by trademark law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, Meritage (sounds like \"heritage\") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, but may also include Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. Commercial use of the term Meritage is allowed only via licensing agreements with the Meritage Association.\n\nFrance has various appellation systems based on the concept of \"terroir\", with classifications ranging from \"Vin de Table\" (\"table wine\") at the bottom, through \"Vin de Pays\" and \"Appellation d'Origine Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure\" (AOVDQS), up to \"Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée\" (AOC) or similar, depending on the region. Portugal has developed a system resembling that of France and, in fact, pioneered this concept in 1756 with a royal charter creating the Demarcated Douro Region and regulating the production and trade of wine. Germany created a similar scheme in 2002, although it has not yet achieved the authority of the other countries' classification systems. Spain, Greece and Italy have classifications based on a dual system of region of origin and product quality.\n\nNew World wines—those made outside the traditional wine regions of Europe—are usually classified by grape rather than by \"terroir\" or region of origin, although there have been unofficial attempts to classify them by quality.\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, wine in Canada is an alcoholic drink that is produced by the complete or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, grape must, products derived solely from fresh grapes, or any combination of them. There are many materials added during the course of the manufacture, such as yeast, concentrated grape juice, dextrose, fructose, glucose or glucose solids, invert sugar, sugar, or aqueous solutions. Calcium sulphate in such quantity that the content of soluble sulphates in the finished wine shall not exceed 0.2 per cent weight by volume calculated as potassium sulphate. Calcium carbonate in such quantity that the content of tartaric acid in the finished wine shall not be less than 0.15 per cent weight by volume. Also, sulphurous acid, including salts thereof, in such quantity that its content in the finished wine shall not exceed 70 parts per million in the free state, or 350 parts per million in the combined state, calculated as sulphur dioxide. Caramel, amylase and pectinase at a maximum level of use consistent with good manufacturing practice. Brandy, fruit spirit or alcohol derived from the alcoholic fermentation of a food source distilled to not less than 94 per cent alcohol by volume. Prior to final filtration may be treated with a strongly acid cation exchange resin in the sodium ion form, or a weakly basic anion exchange resin in the hydroxyl ion form.\n\nIn the United States, for a wine to be vintage-dated and labeled with a country of origin or American Viticultural Area (AVA; e.g., Sonoma Valley), 95% of its volume must be from grapes harvested in that year. If a wine is not labeled with a country of origin or AVA the percentage requirement is lowered to 85%.\n\nVintage wines are generally bottled in a single batch so that each bottle will have a similar taste. Climate's impact on the character of a wine can be significant enough to cause different vintages from the same vineyard to vary dramatically in flavor and quality. Thus, vintage wines are produced to be individually characteristic of the particular vintage and to serve as the flagship wines of the producer. Superior vintages from reputable producers and regions will often command much higher prices than their average ones. Some vintage wines (e.g. Brunello), are only made in better-than-average years.\n\nFor consistency, non-vintage wines can be blended from more than one vintage, which helps wine-makers sustain a reliable market image and maintain sales even in bad years. One recent study suggests that for the average wine drinker, the vintage year may not be as significant for perceived quality as had been thought, although wine connoisseurs continue to place great importance on it.\n\nWine tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and spices. The sweetness of wine is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. Dry wine, for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar. Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine \"breathe\" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. Decanting (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.\n\nDuring aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often \"relaxes\" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor. Older wines generally fade (lose their character and flavor intensity) with extended aeration. Despite these general rules, breathing does not necessarily benefit all wines. Wine may be tasted as soon as the bottle is opened to determine how long it should be aerated, if at all. When tasting wine, individual flavors may also be detected, due to the complex mix of organic molecules (e.g. esters and terpenes) that grape juice and wine can contain. Experienced tasters can distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape and flavors that result from other factors in wine-making. Typical intentional flavor elements in wine—chocolate, vanilla, or coffee—are those imparted by aging in oak casks rather than the grape itself.\n\nVertical and horizontal tasting involves a range of vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter in which there is one vintage from multiple vineyards. \"Banana\" flavors (isoamyl acetate) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as \"medicinal\" or \"Band-Aid\" (4-ethylphenol), \"spicy\" or \"smoky\" (4-ethylguaiacol), and rotten egg (hydrogen sulfide). Some varieties can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil. Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air. Vaporization of these compounds can be accelerated by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature. Many drinkers prefer to chill red wines that are already highly aromatic, like Chinon and Beaujolais.\n\nThe ideal temperature for serving a particular wine is a matter of debate by wine enthusiasts and sommeliers, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally enhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at \"cellar temperature\" (). Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees. Red wines are generally perceived best when served \"chambré\" (\"at room temperature\"). However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room—often around —but rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly cooler than the dining room itself. Pinot noir should be brought to the table for serving at and will reach its full bouquet at . Cabernet Sauvignon, zinfandel, and Rhone varieties should be served at and allowed to warm on the table to for best aroma.\n\nOutstanding vintages from the best vineyards may sell for thousands of dollars per bottle, though the broader term \"fine wine\" covers those typically retailing in excess of US$30–50. \"Investment wines\" are considered by some to be Veblen goods: those for which demand increases rather than decreases as their prices rise.\nParticular selections have higher value, such as \"Verticals\", in which a range of vintages of a specific grape and vineyard, are offered. The most notable was a Château d'Yquem 135 year vertical containing every vintage from 1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5 million.\nThe most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux and Burgundy; cult wines from Europe and elsewhere; and vintage port. Characteristics of highly collectible wines include:\n\n\nInvestment in fine wine has attracted those who take advantage of their victims' relative ignorance of this wine market sector. Such wine fraudsters often profit by charging excessively high prices for off-vintage or lower-status wines from well-known wine regions, while claiming that they are offering a sound investment unaffected by economic cycles. As with any investment, thorough research is essential to making an informed decision.\n\nWine grapes grow almost exclusively between 30 and 50 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. The world's southernmost vineyards are in the Central Otago region of New Zealand's South Island near the 45th parallel south, and the northernmost are in Flen, Sweden, just north of the 59th parallel north.\n\n<nowiki>* May include official, semi-official or estimated data.</nowiki>\n\nThe UK was the world's largest importer of wine in 2007.\n\nWine-consumption data from a list of countries by alcohol consumption measured in liters of pure ethyl alcohol consumed per capita in a given year, according to the most recent data from the World Health Organization. The methodology includes persons 15 years of age or older.\n\nWine is a popular and important drink that accompanies and enhances a wide range of cuisines, from the simple and traditional stews to the most sophisticated and complex haute cuisines. Wine is often served with dinner. Sweet dessert wines may be served with the dessert course. In fine restaurants in Western countries, wine typically accompanies dinner. At a restaurant, patrons are helped to make good food-wine pairings by the restaurant's sommelier or wine waiter. Individuals dining at home may use wine guides to help make food–wine pairings. Wine is also drunk without the accompaniment of a meal in wine bars or with a selection of cheeses (at a wine and cheese party).\n\nWine is important in cuisine not just for its value as a drink, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes. Wine sauce is an example of a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient. Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5–14.5% range. Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.\n\nThe use of wine in ancient Near Eastern and Ancient Egyptian religious ceremonies was common. Libations often included wine, and the religious mysteries of Dionysus used wine as a sacramental entheogen to induce a mind-altering state.\n\nWine is an integral part of Jewish laws and traditions. The \"Kiddush\" is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the Shabbat. On Pesach (Passover) during the Seder, it is a Rabbinic obligation of adults to drink four cups of wine. In the Tabernacle and in the Temple in Jerusalem, the libation of wine was part of the sacrificial service. Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol of blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the blood libel.\n\"It has been one of history's cruel ironies that the blood libel—accusations against Jews using the blood of murdered gentile children for the making of wine and matzot—became the false pretext for numerous pogroms. And due to the danger, those who live in a place where blood libels occur are halachically exempted from using red wine, lest it be seized as \"evidence\" against them.\"\n\nIn Christianity, wine is used in a sacred rite called the Eucharist, which originates in the Gospel account of the Last Supper (Gospel of Luke 22:19) describing Jesus sharing bread and wine with his disciples and commanding them to \"do this in remembrance of me.\" Beliefs about the nature of the Eucharist vary among denominations (see Eucharistic theologies contrasted).\n\nWhile some Christians consider the use of wine from the grape as essential for the validity of the sacrament, many Protestants also allow (or require) pasteurized grape juice as a substitute. Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. Methodist dentist and prohibitionist Thomas Bramwell Welch applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of grape juice. Some Christians who were part of the growing temperance movement pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree. There remains an ongoing debate between some American Protestant denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary drink, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.\n\nAlcoholic drinks, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of Islamic law. In many Muslim countries, possession or consumption of alcoholic drinks carry legal penalties. Iran had previously had a thriving wine industry that disappeared after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. In Greater Persia, \"mey\" (Persian wine) was a central theme of poetry for more than a thousand years, long before the advent of Islam. Some Alevi sects–one of the two main branches of Islam in Turkey (the other being Sunni Islam)–use wine in their religious services.\n\nCertain exceptions to the ban on alcohol apply. Alcohol derived from a source other than the grape (or its byproducts) and the date is allowed in \"very small quantities\" (loosely defined as a quantity that does not cause intoxication) under the Sunni Hanafi \"madhab\", for specific purposes (such as medicines), where the goal is not intoxication. However, modern Hanafi scholars regard alcohol consumption as totally forbidden.\n\nWine contains ethyl alcohol, the same chemical that is present in beer and distilled spirits and as such, wine consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the wine and the timespan that the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting, and death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties against drunk driving.\n\nWines can trigger the positive emotions in a short period of time, such as relaxed and comfortable. The context and quality of wine can affect the mood and emotions, too. \n\nThe main active ingredient of wine is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to wine. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that moderate ethanol consumption brought no mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from ethanol consumption. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption. Some studies have concluded that drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a \"decreased\" risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death. Drinking more than this amount actually increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Some of these studies lumped former ethanol drinkers and life-long abstainers into a single group of nondrinkers, hiding the health benefits of life-long abstention from ethanol. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.\n\nAlcoholism is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.\n\nExcessive consumption of alcohol can cause liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. The American Heart Association \"cautions people NOT to start drinking ... if they do not already drink alcohol. Consult your doctor on the benefits and risks of consuming alcohol in moderation.\"\n\nPopulation studies exhibit a J-curve correlation between wine consumption and rates of heart disease: heavy drinkers have an elevated rate, while people who drink small amount (up to 20 g of alcohol per day, approximately of 12.7% ABV wine) have a lower rate than non-drinkers. Studies have also found that moderate consumption of other alcoholic drinks is correlated with decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes, although the association is stronger for wine. Additionally, some studies have found a greater correlation of health benefits with red than white wine, though other studies have found no difference. Red wine contains more polyphenols than white wine, and these could be protective against cardiovascular disease.\n\nAlthough red wine contains the chemical resveratrol and there is tentative evidence it may improve heart health, the evidence is unclear for those at high risk . Grape skins naturally produce resveratrol in response to fungal infection, including exposure to yeast during fermentation. White wine generally contains lower levels of the chemical as it has minimal contact with grape skins during this process.\n\nIncidents of fraud, such as mislabeling the origin or quality of wines, have resulted in regulations on labeling. \"Wine scandals\" that have received media attention include:\n\nMost wines are sold in glass bottles and sealed with corks (50% of which come from Portugal). An increasing number of wine producers have been using alternative closures such as screwcaps and synthetic plastic \"corks\". Although alternative closures are less expensive and prevent cork taint, they have been blamed for such problems as excessive reduction.\n\nSome wines are packaged in thick plastic bags within corrugated fiberboard boxes, and are called \"box wines\", or \"cask wine\". Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the bag in box, or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine oxidizes more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.\n\nEnvironmental considerations of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A \"New York Times\" editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.\n\nSome wine is sold in stainless steel kegs and is referred to as wine on tap.\n\nWine cellars, or wine rooms, if they are above-ground, are places designed specifically for the storage and aging of wine. Fine restaurants and some private homes have wine cellars. In an active wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. Passive wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types—including red, white, sparkling, and fortified—can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines can maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is , others .\n\nWine refrigerators offer a smaller alternative to wine cellars and are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the proper temperature for drinking. These refrigerators keep the humidity low (usually under 50%), below the optimal humidity of 50% to 70%. Lower humidity levels can dry out corks over time, allowing oxygen to enter the bottle, which reduces the wine's quality through oxidation. While some types of alcohol are sometimes stored in freezer, such as vodka, it is not possible to safely freeze wine in the bottle, as there is insufficient room for it to expand as it freezes and the bottle will usually crack. Certain shapes of bottle may allow the cork to be pushed out by the ice, but if the bottle is frozen on its side, the wine in the narrower neck will invariably freeze first, preventing this.\n\nThere are a large number of occupations and professions that are part of the wine industry, ranging from the individuals who grow the grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make recommendations to clients and serve the wine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33779", "title": "Worcestershire sauce", "text": "Worcestershire sauce\n\nWorcestershire sauce () is a fermented liquid condiment created in the city of Worcester in Worcestershire, England, in the first half of the 19th century. The creators were the chemists John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins, who went on to form the company Lea & Perrins. Worcestershire sauce has been considered a generic term since 1876, when the High Court of the United Kingdom ruled that Lea & Perrins did not own the trademark to \"Worcestershire\".\n\nWorcestershire sauce is frequently used to enhance food and drink recipes, including Welsh rarebit, Caesar salad, Oysters Kirkpatrick, and deviled eggs. As both a background flavour and a source of umami (the savoury \"fifth flavour\"), it is also now added to dishes which historically did not contain it, such as chili con carne and beef stew. It is also used directly as a condiment on steaks, hamburgers, and other finished dishes, and to flavour cocktails such as the Bloody Mary and Caesar.\n\nA fermented fish sauce called \"garum\" was a staple of Greco-Roman cuisine and of the Mediterranean economy of the Roman Empire, as the first-century encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder writes in his \"Historia Naturalis\" and the fourth/fifth-century Roman culinary text Apicius includes garum in its recipes. The use of similar fermented anchovy sauces in Europe can be traced back to the 17th century. \n\nThe Lea & Perrins brand was commercialised in 1837 and was the first type of sauce to bear the Worcestershire name. The origin of the Lea & Perrins recipe is unclear. The packaging originally stated that the sauce came \"from the recipe of a nobleman in the county\". The company has also claimed that \"Lord Marcus Sandys, ex-Governor of Bengal\" encountered it while in India with the East India Company in the 1830s, and commissioned the local apothecaries to recreate it. \n\nAccording to company tradition, when the recipe was first mixed there the resulting product was so strong that it was considered inedible and the barrel was abandoned in the basement. Looking to make space in the storage area a few years later, the chemists decided to try it again, and discovered that the long fermented sauce had mellowed and was now palatable. In 1838 the first bottles of \"Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce\" were released to the general public.\n\nIn 2009, Lea & Perrins accountant Brian Keogh found notes from the 1800s dumped in a skip. The documents were to be placed on display at the Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum.\n\nThe Lea & Perrins brand was commercialised in 1837 and has continued to be the leading global brand of Worcestershire sauce.\n\nOn 16 October 1897, Lea & Perrins relocated manufacturing of the sauce from their pharmacy to a factory in the city of Worcester on Midland Road, where it is still made. The factory produces ready-mixed bottles for domestic distribution and a concentrate for bottling abroad.\n\nIn 1930, the Lea & Perrins operation was purchased by HP Foods, which was in turn acquired by the Imperial Tobacco Company in 1967. HP was sold to Danone in 1988 and then to Heinz in 2005.\n\nDue to a shortage during World War II, Lea and Perrins switched from using soy sauce to hydrolyzed vegetable protein.\n\nThe US version is packaged differently from the British version, coming in a dark bottle with a beige label and wrapped in paper. Lea & Perrins USA claims this practice is a vestige of shipping practices from the 19th century, when the product was imported from England, as a measure of protection for the bottles. The producer also claims that its Worcestershire sauce is the oldest commercially bottled condiment in the US.\n\nThe original ingredients in a bottle of Worcestershire sauce sold were:\n\n\nThe \"spice\" and \"flavourings\" are believed to include cloves, soy sauce, lemons, pickles and peppers.\n\nAnchovies in many Worcestershire sauces is a concern to people allergic to fish, vegans, other vegetarians and others who avoid eating fish. The \"Codex Alimentarius\" recommends that prepared food containing Worcestershire sauce with anchovies include a label warning of fish content although this is not required in most jurisdictions. The US Department of Agriculture has forced the recall of some products with undeclared Worcestershire sauce. Several brands sell anchovy-free varieties of Worcestershire sauce, often labelled as vegetarian or vegan. Generally, Orthodox Jews refrain from eating fish and meat in the same dish, so cannot use traditional Worcestershire sauce to flavour meat. However, certain brands are certified to contain less than 1/60th of the fish product and can be used with meat.\n\nWorcestershire sauce is variously known as \"spicy soy sauce\" () in the mainland, \"Worcester sauce\" () in Taiwan, and \"gip-sauce\" () in Hong Kong and neighboring southern regions. It sees use in Cantonese dim sum as well as Haipai cuisine, with dishes including steamed meatball, spring rolls, Shanghai-style pork chops and borscht served with the sauce.\n\nIn Denmark, Worcestershire sauce is commonly known as \"Engelsk sauce\", meaning 'English sauce'.\n\nWorcestershire Sauce, known colloquially as salsa inglesa (English sauce) or salsa Perrins (Perrins sauce), is extremely popular in El Salvador, where many restaurants provide a bottle on each table. Over 120,000 gallons or per person is consumed annually, the highest per-capita consumption in the world as of 1996.\n\nIn Japan, Worcestershire sauce is labelled \"Worcester\" (rather than \"Worcestershire\") in katakana (). Many sauces are more of a vegetarian variety, with the base being water, syrup, vinegar, puree of apple and tomato puree, and the flavor less spicy and sweeter. Japanese Agricultural Standard defines types of the sauces by viscosity, with Worcester sauce proper having a viscosity of less than 0.2 Poiseuille. Thick (> 2 Poiseuille) sauces are more common; they are manufactured there under brand names such as Otafuku and Bulldog, but these are brown sauces more similar to HP Sauce rather than any type of Worcestershire sauce.\n\nTonkatsu sauce is a variation of Worcestershire sauce associated with the dish tonkatsu. It is a vegetarian sauce made from vegetables and fruits.\n\nGy-NGuang Worcestershire sauce has been produced since 1917.\n\nHolbrook's worcestershire has been produced since 1875 but relocated to Australia in the 1950s \n\nFrench's Worcestershire sauce was introduced in 1941.\n\nHeinz also makes a Worcestershire sauce.\n\n\n"}

Often milk or half and half will be used as an alternative to cream.\n\nThe traditional cocktail known as a Black Russian, which first appeared in 1949, becomes a White Russian with the addition of cream. Neither drink is Russian in origin, but both are so named due to vodka being the primary ingredient. It is unclear which drink preceded the other.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" refers to the first mention of the word \"White Russian\" in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California's \"Oakland Tribune\" on November 21, 1965. It was placed in the newspaper as an insert: \"White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream\", with \"Southern\" referring to Coffee Southern, a short-lived brand of coffee liqueur by Southern Comfort.\n\nThough long regarded as a boring and unsophisticated drink, the White Russian saw a surge in popularity after the 1998 release of the film \"The Big Lebowski\". Throughout the movie, it appears as the beverage of choice for the protagonist, \"the Dude\". On a number of occasions he refers to the drink as a \"Caucasian\".\n\nAs with all cocktails, various modes of preparation exist, varying according to the recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists. Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur. Shaking the cream in order to thicken it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common. Sometimes the drink is prepared on the stove with hot coffee for a warm treat on cold days. Conversely, vanilla ice cream has been known to be used, rather than cream, to make it frozen. \n\nMany variants of the cocktail exist, both localized and widely known, such as a Blind Russian (also known as a Muddy Water) which substitutes cream with Irish Cream, a Mudslide (a Blind Russian with both), White Canadian (made with goat's milk), an Anna Kournikova (named after Anna Kournikova the tennis player, made with skimmed milk (a skinny white Russian), a White Cuban (made with rum instead of vodka), or a Dirty Russian (made with chocolate milk instead of cream).\n\n\n\n"}

In computing, the word is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable or as a video game cheat code, the canonical \"magic word\".\n\nModern usage is primarily from one of the earliest computer games, \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", in which the idea is to explore a cave with many rooms, collecting the treasures found there. By typing \"xyzzy\" at the appropriate time, the player could move instantly between two otherwise distant points. As \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" was both one of the first adventure games and one of the first interactive fiction pieces, hundreds of later interactive fiction games included responses to the command \"xyzzy\" in tribute.\n\nThe origin of the word \"xyzzy\" has been the subject of debate. According to Rick Adams, the sequence of letters \"XYZZY\" has been used as a mnemonic to remember the process for computing cross products. Crowther, author of \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", states that he was unaware of the mnemonic, and that he \"made it up from whole cloth\" when writing the game.\n\nXyzzy has been implemented as an undocumented no-op command on several operating systems; in the 16-bit version of Data General's AOS, for example, it would typically respond \"Nothing happens\", just as the game did if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word. The 32-bit version, AOS/VS, would respond \"Twice as much happens\". On several computer systems from Sun Microsystems, the command \"xyzzy\" is used to enter the interactive shell of the U-Boot bootloader. Early versions of Zenith Z-DOS (a re-branded variant of MS-DOS 1.25) had the command \"xyzzy\" which took a parameter of \"on\" or \"off\". Xyzzy by itself would print the status of the last \"xyzzy on\" or \"xyzzy off\" command.\n\nWhen booting a Cr-48 from developer mode, when the screen displays the \"sad laptop\" image, pressing xyzzy produces a joke BSOD screen.\n\nAccording to Brantley Coile, the Cisco PIX firewall had a xyzzy command that simply said \"Nothing happens.\" He also put the command into the Coraid VSX to escape the CLI and get into the shell. It would announce \"Foof! You are in a directory. There are files here.\" The new California Coraid management, lacking a sense of humor, made development to change the string to \"/exportmode\" and get rid of the Foof! Since regaining ownership of the Coraid software, the command is being returned to the system and now, in VSX release 8, the response is \"»Foof!« You are in a debris room.\".\n\nWithin the low-traffic Usenet newsgroup alt.xyzzy, the word is used for test messages, to which other readers (if there are any) customarily respond, \"Nothing happens\" as a note that the test message was successfully received. In the Internet Relay Chat client mIRC and Pidgin, entering the undocumented command \"/xyzzy\" will display the response \"Nothing happens\". The string \"xyzzy\" is also used internally by mIRC as the hard-coded master encryption key that is used to decrypt over 20 sensitive strings from within the mirc.exe program file.\nA \"deluxe chatting program\" for DIGITAL's VAX/VMS written by David Bolen in 1987 and distributed via BITNET took the name xyzzy. It enabled users on the same system or on linked DECnet nodes to communicate via text in real time. There was a compatible program with the same name for IBM's VM/CMS.\n\nxYzZY is used as the default boundary marker by the Perl HTTP::Message module for multipart MIME messages, and was used in Apple's AtEase for workgroups as the default administrator password in the 1990s.\n\nGmail lists XYZZY as a capability when connected via IMAP before logging in. It takes no arguments, and responds with \"OK Nothing happens.\"\n\nThe Hewlett-Packard 9836A computer with HPL 2.0 programming language has XYZZY built into the HPL language itself with the result of \"I see no cave here.\" when used. The same message is returned from HP 3458A and HP 3245A instruments when queried with XYZZY via the HPIB bus.\n\nIn most versions of the Ingres dbms, \"select xyzzy(<nowiki>\"</nowiki>)\" returns \"Nothing happens.\" However, \"select xyzzy('wim')\" returns \"Nothing happens to Wim\". The xyzzy() function has been part of the Ingres product since at least version 5 (late 1980s), but was removed from the main codeline sometime in the early 2000s. While talking to one of the members of the Ingres development team, Wim de Boer, at that time the secretary of the Ingres Users Group Nederland (IUGN), mentioned the removal of this Easter egg. This developer, who was a frequent speaker on the events organised by the IUGN, somehow managed to put the function back into the product and—especially for Wim—added handling for the 'wim' value of the parameter.\n\nThe popular \"Minesweeper\" game under older versions of Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by entering the command codice_1, then pressing the key sequence shift and then enter, which turned a single pixel in the top-left corner of the entire screen into a small black or white dot depending on whether or not the mouse pointer is over a mine. This easter egg was present in all Windows versions through Windows XP Service Pack 3, but under Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.0 the pixel was visible only if the standard Explorer desktop was not running. The easter egg does not exist in versions after Windows XP SP3.\n\nIn the game Zork, typing xyzzy and pressing enter produces the response: \"A hollow voice says 'fool. The command commonly produces a humorous response in other Infocom games and text adventures, leading to its usage in the title of the interactive fiction competition, the XYZZY Awards.\n\nIn Dungeons and Dragons Online, Xy'zzy is the nigh-invulnerable raid boss in the Hound of Xoriat adventure.\n\nIn the PC version of the popular Electronic Arts game Road Rash, the cheat mode is enabled by typing the key string \"xyzzy\" in the middle of the race.\n\nIn Primordia, one is able to get a bonus short scene featuring a shout-out to Colossal Cave Adventure as a form of non-playable text-adventure, which is accessible by typing 'xyzzy' in Memorious's data-kiosk.\n\nIn the video game Deus Ex, protagonist JC Denton is trying to make contact with the Mole People, and when their representative, Curly, prompts for a password to reveal the Mole People's hideout, Denton tries \"xyzzy\" if the password has not been obtained by him beforehand. Curly denies this attempt, as one would expect.\n\nAndrew Sega released an album under the name XYZZY.\n"}
{"id": "36956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36956", "title": "Cappuccino", "text": "Cappuccino\n\nA cappuccino (; Italian plural cappuccini) is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).\n\nVariations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.\n\nThe name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits, and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink.\n\nThe Viennese bestowed the name \"Kapuziner\", possibly in the 18th century, on a version that included whipped cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste and other cities in the former Austria in the first decades of the 20th century. The drink has since spread worldwide and can be found at a number of establishments.\n\nOutside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of double espresso and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The double espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called \"latte art\".\n\nIn a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffee houses in the United States, the total of espresso and milk/foam make up between approximately . Commercial coffee restaurant chains in the US more often serve the cappuccino as a drink or larger. In Italy, a cappuccino consists of of espresso; the rest of the cup is filled with equal parts of milk and foam. Outside of Italy, the ratios of espresso, milk, and foam typically equal 1/3 each.\n\nCappuccino is traditionally small (180 ml maximum) with a thick layer of foam, while \"latte\" traditionally is larger (200–300 ml). Caffè latte is often served in a large glass; cappuccino mostly in a 150–180 ml cup with a handle. Cappuccino traditionally has a layer of textured milk microfoam exceeding 1 cm in thickness; microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and so numerous that they are not seen, but it makes the milk lighter and thicker. As a result, the microfoam will remain partly on top of the mug when the espresso is poured in correctly as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.\n\nThe World Barista Championships have been arranged annually since 2000, and during the course of the competition, the competing barista must produce—for four sensory judges—among other drinks four cappuccinos, defined in WBC Rules and Regulations as [...] a coffee and milk beverage that should produce a harmonious balance of rich, sweet milk and espresso [...] The cappuccino is prepared with one (1) single shot of espresso, textured milk and foam. A minimum of 1 centimeter of foam depth [...] A cappuccino is a beverage between 150 ml and 180 ml in total volume [...]\n\n'Cappuccino' comes from Latin \"Caputium\", later borrowed in German/Austrian and modified into \"kapuziner\". It is the diminutive form of cappuccio in Italian, meaning \"hood\" or something that covers the head, thus \"cappuccino\" literally means \"small capuchin\". It is believed the Capuchin friar, Marco d'Aviano, was the inspiration for this beverage.\n\nThe coffee beverage has its name not from the \"hood\" but from the \"colour\" of the hooded robes worn by monks and nuns of the Capuchin order. This colour is quite distinctive, and \"capuchin\" was a common description of the colour of red-brown in 17th century Europe. The Capuchin monks chose the particular design of their orders' robes both in colour and shape of the hood back in the 16th century, inspired by Francis of Assisi's preserved 13th century vestments. The long and pointed hood was characteristic and soon gave the brothers the nickname \"capuchins\" (hood-wearing). It was, however, the choice of red-brown as the order's vestment colour that, as early as the 17th century, saw \"capuchin\" used also as a term for a specific colour. While Francis of Assisi humbly used uncoloured and un-bleached wool for his robes, the Capuchins coloured their vestments to differ from Augustinians, Benedictines, Franciscans, and other orders.\n\nThe word \"cappuccino\", in its Italian form, is not known in Italian writings until the 20th century, but the German language \"kapuziner\" is mentioned as a coffee beverage in the 18th century in Austria, and is described as, \"coffee with sugar, egg yolks and cream\", in dictionary entries from 1800 onwards. Kapuziner was by the First World War a common coffee drink in cafés in the parts of northern Italy which at that time still belonged to Austria.\n\nThe use of fresh milk in coffee in cafés and restaurants is a newer phenomenon (from the 20th century), introduced when refrigeration became common. The use of full cream is known much further back in time (but not in the use as whipped cream [chantilly] ), as this was a product more easily stored and frequently used also in cooking and baking. Thus, a kapuziner was prepared with a very small amount of cream to get the capuchin colour. Today, kapuziner is still served in Viennese traditional cafés, comprising still black coffee with only a few drops of cream (in some establishments developed into a capå of whipped cream).\n\nThe consumption of coffee in Europe was initially based on the traditional Ottoman preparation of the drink, by bringing to boil the mixture of coffee and water together, sometimes adding sugar. The British seem to have started filtering and steeping coffee already in the second part of the 18th century, and France and continental Europe followed suit. By the 19th century, coffee was brewed in different devices designed for both home and public cafés.\n\nAdding milk to coffee was mentioned by Europeans already in the 1700s, and sometimes advised.\n\nCappuccino originated as the coffee beverage kapuziner in the Viennese coffee houses in the 1700s, at the same time as the counterpart coffee beverage named Franziskaner: kapuziner shows up on coffee house menus all over the Habsburg Monarchy around this time, and is in 1805 described in a \"Wörterbuch\" (dictionary) as \"coffee with cream and sugar\" (although it does not say how it is composed). Kapuziner is mentioned again in writings in the 1850s, described as \"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\". Around the same time, the coffee beverage melange is mentioned in writings, explained as a blend of coffee and milk, presumably similar to the modern day caffè latte. Other coffees containing cream surfaced in Vienna, and outside Austria these are referred to as \"Viennese coffee\" or \"café Viennois\", coffee with whipped cream. Predecessors of Irish coffee, sweetened coffee with different alcohols, topped with whipped cream also spread out from Vienna.\n\nKapuziner took its name from the colour of coffee with a few drops of cream, so nicknamed because the Capuchin monks in Vienna and elsewhere wore vestments with this colour. Another popular coffee was Franziskaner, with more cream, referring to the somewhat lighter brown colour of the robes of monks of the Franciscan order.\n\nCappuccino as we write it today (in Italian) is first mentioned in northern Italy in the 1930s, and photographs from that time depict the drink resembling \"Viennese\", a coffee topped with whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon or chocolate. The Italian cappuccino evolved and developed in the following decades: the steamed milk atop is a later addition, and in the US a slight misunderstanding has led to the naming of this \"cap\" of milk foam \"monk's head\", although it originally had nothing to do with the name of the beverage.\n\nAlthough coffee was brewed differently all over Europe after the Second World War, in Italy, the real espresso machines became widespread only during the 1950s, and \"cappuccino\" was redefined, now made from espresso and frothed milk (although far from the quality of \"microfoam\" steamed milk today). As the espresso machines improved, so did the dosing of coffee and the heating of the milk. Outside Italy, cappuccino spread but was generally made from dark coffee with whipped cream, as it still is in large parts of Europe even in 2014.\n\nKapuziner remained unchanged on the Austrian coffee menu, even in Trieste, which by 1920 belonged to Italy, and in Bratislava, Budapest, Prague, and other cities of the former empire.\n\nEspresso machines were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, after Luigi Bezzera of Milan filed the first patent in 1901, although the first generations of machines certainly did not make espresso the way we define it today.\n\nCoffee making in cafés changed in the first decades of the 20th century. These first machines made it possible to serve coffee espresso specifically to each customer. The cups were still the same size, and the dose of beans was ground coarse as before. The too high temperature of the boilers scalded the coffee, and several attempts at improving this came in the years after the First World War.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, the Italians launched the \"age of \"crema\"\", as the new coffee machines could create a higher pressure, leading to a finer grind and the now classic \"crema\".\n\nThe first small cups appeared in the 1950s, and the machines could by then also heat milk, thus, the modern cappuccino was born. In Vienna, espresso bars were introduced in the 1950s, leading to both the kapuziner and the new-born Italian cappuccino's being served as two different beverages alongside each other.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, espresso coffee initially gained popularity in the form of the cappuccino, influenced by the British custom of drinking coffee with milk, the desire for a longer drink to preserve the café as a destination, and the exotic texture of the beverage.\n\nAs cappuccino is defined today, in addition to a double shot of espresso, the most important factors in preparing a cappuccino are the texture and temperature of the milk. When a barista steams the milk for a cappuccino, microfoam is created by introducing very tiny bubbles of air into the milk, giving the milk a velvety texture. The traditional cappuccino consists of a single espresso, on which the barista pours the hot foamed milk, resulting in a thick milk foam on top. Variations could be made adding another shot of espresso resulting in a double cappuccino. Attaining the correct ratio of foam requires close attention while steaming the milk, thus making the cappuccino one of the most difficult espresso-based beverages to make properly. A skilled barista may obtain artistic shapes (latte art while pouring the milk on the top of the espresso coffee.\nCappuccino was traditionally a taste largely appreciated in Europe, Australia, South America, and some of North America. By the mid-1990s, cappuccino was made much more widely available to North Americans, as upscale coffee houses sprang up.\n\nIn Italy and throughout continental Europe, cappuccino is traditionally consumed in the morning, usually as part of breakfast, often with some kind of pastry. Italians generally do not drink cappuccino with meals other than breakfast, although they sometimes drink espresso after lunch or dinner. In Italy, cappuccino is only consumed up to 11:00 a.m., since cappuccinos are milk-based and considered too heavy to drink later in the day. Instead, espresso is usually ordered after a meal due to the belief that the lack of milk aids in digestion. In North America, cappuccinos have become popular concurrent with the boom in the American coffee industry through the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially in the urban Pacific Northwest.\n\nCappuccino is traditionally served in cups. By the start of the 21st century, a modified \"short-cut\" version was being served by fast-food chains in servings up to .\n\nAlthough size is what varies most among different cappuccinos, there are two main ways of preparing cappuccino: one is the traditional or classical way with a cap of milk foam; the other is the \"latte art\" way. The former follows the traditional idea of the cappuccino being prepared by ⅓ espresso, ⅓ steamed milk and ⅓ milk foam. The latte follows the same recipe, but is served more often in smaller cups, and the textured milk is gently poured in and finished with a pattern in the surface \"crèma\". The illustrations in this article show the preparation methods.\n\nIn Canada, the Tim Hortons coffee chain sells iced coffee cappuccino under the brand name Iced Capps. The coffee drink mix comes to the Tim Hortons stores as a thick black syrup which is mixed at three parts water to one part syrup in a Slurpee machine. The frozen coffee drink is then blended with cream at the time of service (or blended with milk, or chocolate milk upon customer request). The Ice Capp can also be prepared as a Supreme, which includes a flavour shot, whipped topping, and either caramel or chocolate syrup. The chain also carries iced coffee on both its Canadian and U.S. menus.\n\nIn Cyprus and Greece, iced cappuccino is widespread, known locally as \"Freddo Cappuccino\", as opposed to \"Cappuccino Freddo\". Despite its Italian name, the drink both tastes and is prepared differently from its Italian counterpart, and it is uncommon in Italy and outside Greece. The \"Freddo Cappuccino\" is topped with a cold milk-based foam known as aphrogala (), which is created using cold milk and an electric frother. These frothers are commonplace in Greek coffeeshops due to their usage during the preparation of frappé coffee. The foam is then added to espresso poured over ice. Outside Greece and Cyprus, Cappuccino Freddo is mostly found in coffee shops and delis catering to the Greek expat community. More recently, Starbucks has added the Cappuccino Freddo to branch menus in Europe. \n\nCappuccino Freddo is the cold version of a cappuccino, and the drink usually has a small amount of cold frothed milk atop it. This drink is widely available in Cyprus, Greece, and parts of Italy. In Rome, for example, each bar has the drink already prepared. In cities of Northern Italy, like Milan, however, it is almost impossible to find \"Cappuccino Freddo\". Instead, \"gelato da bere\" (a thick blend of gelato and espresso) or \"shakerato\" (espresso and ice shaken together) are more popular. The term has also spread throughout the Mediterranean region where foam is added to the drink just before serving, often varying from the Italian original.\n\nIn North America, however, the terms \"Cappuccino Freddo\" or \"Iced cappuccino\", if offered, may be somewhat of a misnomer if the characteristic frothed milk is omitted in the iced variation. For example, at Starbucks, without the frothed milk the drink is called an \"iced latte\".\n\nOther milk and espresso drinks similar to the cappuccino include:\n\n\n"}

Throughout recorded history it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world and is one of the oldest man-made foods, having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture.\n\nBread may be leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring sourdough microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration. Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of manufacturing.\n\nBread plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture.\n\nThe Old English word for bread was \"hlaf\" (\"hlaifs\" in Gothic: modern English \"loaf\"), which appears to be the oldest Teutonic name. Old High German \"hleib\" and modern German \"Laib\" derive from this Proto-Germanic word, which was borrowed into Slavic (Polish \"chleb\", Russian \"khleb\") and Finnic (Finnish \"leipä\", Estonian \"leib\") languages as well.\nThe Middle and Modern English word bread appears in Germanic languages, such as West Frisian \"brea\", Dutch \"brood\", German \"Brot\", Swedish \"bröd\", and Norwegian and Danish \"brød\"; it may be related to \"brew\" or perhaps to \"break\", originally meaning \"broken piece\", \"morsel\".\n\nBread is one of the oldest prepared foods. Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants. It is possible that during this time, starch extract from the roots of plants, such as cattails and ferns, was spread on a flat rock, placed over a fire and cooked into a primitive form of flatbread. The world's oldest evidence of bread-making has been found in a 14,500 year old Natufian site in Jordan's northeastern desert. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay of making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, including on the surface of cereal grains, so any dough left to rest leavens naturally.\n\nThere were multiple sources of leavening available for early bread. Airborne yeasts could be harnessed by leaving uncooked dough exposed to air for some time before cooking. Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer called barm to produce \"a lighter kind of bread than other peoples\" such as barm cake. Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape juice and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting, or wheat bran steeped in wine, as a source for yeast. The most common source of leavening was to retain a piece of dough from the previous day to use as a form of sourdough starter, as Pliny also reported.\n\nThe Chorleywood bread process was developed in 1961; it uses the intense mechanical working of dough to dramatically reduce the fermentation period and the time taken to produce a loaf. The process, whose high-energy mixing allows for the use of lower protein grain, is now widely used around the world in large factories. As a result, bread can be produced very quickly and at low costs to the manufacturer and the consumer. However, there has been some criticism of the effect on nutritional value.\n\nBread is the staple food of the Middle East, Central Asia, North Africa, Europe, and in European-derived cultures such as those in the Americas, Australia, and Southern Africa, in contrast to parts of South and East Asia where rice or noodle is the staple. Bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. The addition of yeast to the bread explains the air pockets commonly found in bread. Owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common or bread wheat is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, which makes the largest single contribution to the world's food supply of any food.\n\nBread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including spelt, emmer, einkorn and kamut). Non-wheat cereals including rye, barley, maize (corn), oats, sorghum, millet and rice have been used to make bread, but, with the exception of rye, usually in combination with wheat flour as they have less gluten.\n\nGluten-free breads have been created for people affected by gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, who may benefit from a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free bread is made with ground flours from a variety of materials such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, or legumes such as beans, and tubers such as cassava, but since these flours lack gluten they may not hold their shape as they rise and their crumb may be dense with little aeration. Additives such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.\nIn wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in hulls in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid, where it is relevant to wheat resistance to fungal diseases.\n\nRye bread contains phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers.\n\nThree natural phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed.\n\nGlutenin and gliadin are functional proteins found in wheat bread that contribute to the structure of bread. Glutenin forms interconnected gluten networks within bread through interchain disulfide bonds. Gliadin binds weakly to the gluten network established by glutenin via intrachain disulfide bonds. Structurally, bread can be defined as an elastic-plastic foam (same as styrofoam). The glutenin protein contributes to its elastic nature, as it is able to regain its initial shape after deformation. The gliadin protein contributes to its plastic nature, because it demonstrates non-reversible structural change after a certain amount of applied force. Because air pockets within this gluten network result from carbon dioxide production during leavening, bread can be defined as a foam, or a gas-in-solid solution.\n\nBread can be served at many temperatures; once baked, it can subsequently be toasted. It is most commonly eaten with the hands, either by itself or as a carrier for other foods. Bread can be dipped into liquids such as gravy, olive oil, or soup; it can be topped with various sweet and savory spreads, or used to make sandwiches containing meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.\n\nBread is used as an ingredient in other culinary preparations, such as the use of breadcrumbs to provide crunchy crusts or thicken sauces, sweet or savoury bread puddings, or as a binding agent in sausages and other ground meat products.\n\nNutritionally, bread is categorized as a source of grains in the food pyramid and is a good source of carbohydrates and nutrients such as magnesium, iron, selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber.\n\nBread crust is formed from surface dough during the cooking process. It is hardened and browned through the Maillard reaction using the sugars and amino acids and the intense heat at the bread surface. The crust of most breads is harder, and more complexly and intensely flavored, than the rest. Old wives tales suggest that eating the bread crust makes a person's hair curlier. Additionally, the crust is rumored to be healthier than the remainder of the bread. Some studies have shown that this is true as the crust has more dietary fiber and antioxidants such as pronyl-lysine, which is being researched for its potential colorectal cancer inhibitory properties.\n\nDoughs are usually baked, but in some cuisines breads are steamed (e.g., mantou), fried (e.g., puri), or baked on an unoiled frying pan (e.g., tortillas). It may be leavened or unleavened (e.g. matzo). Salt, fat and leavening agents such as yeast and baking soda are common ingredients, though bread may contain other ingredients, such as milk, egg, sugar, spice, fruit such as raisins, vegetables such as onion, nuts such as walnut or seeds such as poppy.\n\nMethods of processing dough into bread include the straight dough process, the sourdough process, the Chorleywood bread process and the sponge and dough process.\n\nProfessional bread recipes are stated using the baker's percentage notation. The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, and the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours absorb about 62% water, while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%. Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast breads, the higher water percentages result in more CO bubbles and a coarser bread crumb. One pound (450 g) of flour yields a standard loaf of bread or two French loaves.\n\nCalcium propionate is commonly added by commercial bakeries to retard the growth of molds.\n\nFlour is grain ground to a powdery consistency. Flour provides the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The protein content of the flour is the best indicator of the quality of the bread dough and the finished bread. While bread can be made from all-purpose wheat flour, a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12–14%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9–11%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.\n\nWheat flour, in addition to its starch, contains three water-soluble protein groups (albumin, globulin, and proteoses) and two water-insoluble protein groups (glutenin and gliadin). When flour is mixed with water, the water-soluble proteins dissolve, leaving the glutenin and gliadin to form the structure of the resulting bread. When relatively dry dough is worked by kneading, or wet dough is allowed to rise for a long time (see no-knead bread), the glutenin forms strands of long, thin, chainlike molecules, while the shorter gliadin forms bridges between the strands of glutenin. The resulting networks of strands produced by these two proteins are known as gluten. Gluten development improves if the dough is allowed to autolyse.\n\nWater, or some other liquid, is used to form the flour into a paste or dough. The weight of liquid required varies between recipes, but a ratio of 3 parts liquid to 5 parts flour is common for yeast breads. Recipes that use steam as the primary leavening method may have a liquid content in excess of 1 part liquid to 1 part flour. Instead of water, recipes may use liquids such as milk or other dairy products (including buttermilk or yoghurt), fruit juice, or eggs. These contribute additional sweeteners, fats, or leavening components, as well as water.\n\nFats, such as butter, vegetable oils, lard, or that contained in eggs, affect the development of gluten in breads by coating and lubricating the individual strands of protein. They also help to hold the structure together. If too much fat is included in a bread dough, the lubrication effect causes the protein structures to divide. A fat content of approximately 3% by weight is the concentration that produces the greatest leavening action. In addition to their effects on leavening, fats also serve to tenderize breads and preserve freshness.\n\nBread improvers and dough conditioners are often used in producing commercial breads to reduce the time needed for rising and to improve texture and volume. The substances used may be oxidising agents to strengthen the dough or reducing agents to develop gluten and reduce mixing time, emulsifiers to strengthen the dough or to provide other properties such as making slicing easier, or enzymes to increase gas production.\n\nSalt is often added to enhance flavor and restrict yeast activity. It also affects the crumb and the overall texture by stabilizing and strengthening the gluten. Some artisan bakers forego early addition of salt to the dough, whether wholemeal or refined, and wait until after a 20-minute rest to allow the dough to autolyse.\n\nLeavening is the process of adding gas to a dough before or during baking to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread. Most bread eaten in the West is leavened.\n\nA simple technique for leavening bread is the use of gas-producing chemicals. There are two common methods. The first is to use baking powder or a self-raising flour that includes baking powder. The second is to include an acidic ingredient such as buttermilk and add baking soda; the reaction of the acid with the soda produces gas. Chemically leavened breads are called \"quick breads\" and \"soda breads\". This method is commonly used to make muffins, pancakes, American-style biscuits, and quick breads such as banana bread.\n\nMany breads are leavened by yeast. The yeast most commonly used for leavening bread is \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", the same species used for brewing alcoholic beverages. This yeast ferments some of the carbohydrates in the flour, including any sugar, producing carbon dioxide. Commercial bakers often leaven their dough with commercially produced baker's yeast. Baker's yeast has the advantage of producing uniform, quick, and reliable results, because it is obtained from a pure culture. Many artisan bakers produce their own yeast with a growth culture. If kept in the right conditions, it provides leavening for many years.\n\nThe baker's yeast and sourdough methods follow the same pattern. Water is mixed with flour, salt and the leavening agent. Other additions (spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc.) are not needed to bake bread, but are often used. The mixed dough is then allowed to rise one or more times (a longer rising time results in more flavor, so bakers often \"punch down\" the dough and let it rise again), then loaves are formed, and (after an optional final rising time) the bread is baked in an oven.\n\nMany breads are made from a \"straight dough\", which means that all of the ingredients are combined in one step, and the dough is baked after the rising time; others are made from a \"pre-ferment\" in which the leavening agent is combined with some of the flour and water a day or so ahead of baking and allowed to ferment overnight. On the day of baking, the rest of the ingredients are added, and the process continues as with straight dough. This produces a more flavorful bread with better texture. Many bakers see the starter method as a compromise between the reliable results of baker's yeast and the flavor and complexity of a longer fermentation. It also allows the baker to use only a minimal amount of baker's yeast, which was scarce and expensive when it first became available. Most yeasted pre-ferments fall into one of three categories: \"poolish\" or \"pouliche\", a loose-textured mixture composed of roughly equal amounts of flour and water (by weight); \"biga\", a stiff mixture with a higher proportion of flour; and \"pâte fermentée\", which is simply a portion of dough reserved from a previous batch.\n\nSourdough is a type of bread produced by a long fermentation of dough using naturally occurring yeasts and lactobacilli. It usually has a mildly sour taste because of the lactic acid produced during anaerobic fermentation by the lactobacilli.\n\nSourdough breads are made with a sourdough starter. The starter cultivates yeast and lactobacilli in a mixture of flour and water, making use of the microorganisms already present on flour; it does not need any added yeast. A starter may be maintained indefinitely by regular additions of flour and water. Some bakers have starters many generations old, which are said to have a special taste or texture. At one time, all yeast-leavened breads were sourdoughs. Recently there has been a revival of sourdough bread in artisan bakeries.\n\nTraditionally, peasant families throughout Europe baked on a fixed schedule, perhaps once a week. The starter was saved from the previous week's dough. The starter was mixed with the new ingredients, the dough was left to rise, and then a piece of it was saved (to be the starter for next week's bread).\n\nThe rapid expansion of steam produced during baking leavens the bread, which is as simple as it is unpredictable. Steam-leavening is unpredictable since the steam is not produced until the bread is baked. Steam leavening happens regardless of the raising agents (baking soda, yeast, baking powder, sour dough, beaten egg white) included in the mix. The leavening agent either contains air bubbles or generates carbon dioxide. The heat vaporises the water from the inner surface of the bubbles within the dough. The steam expands and makes the bread rise. This is the main factor in the rising of bread once it has been put in the oven. CO generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise. Heat kills bacteria or yeast at an early stage, so the CO generation is stopped.\n\nSalt-rising bread employs a form of bacterial leavening that does not require yeast. Although the leavening action is inconsistent, and requires close attention to the incubating conditions, this bread is making a comeback for its cheese-like flavor and fine texture.\n\nAerated bread was leavened by carbon dioxide being forced into dough under pressure. From the mid 19th to mid 20th centuries bread made this way was somewhat popular in the United Kingdom, made by the Aerated Bread Company and sold in its high-street tearooms. The company was founded in 1862, and ceased independent operations in 1955.\n\nThe Pressure-Vacuum mixer was later developed by the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association for the Chorleywood bread process. It manipulates the gas bubble size and optionally the composition of gases in the dough via the gas applied to the headspace. The organic baker Andrew Whitely, writing in \"The Independent\", called the process \"the covert corruption of our daily food\".\n\nBread has a significance beyond mere nutrition in many cultures because of its history and contemporary importance. Bread is also significant in Christianity as one of the elements (alongside wine) of the Eucharist, and in other religions including Paganism.\n\nIn many cultures, bread is a metaphor for basic necessities and living conditions in general. For example, a \"bread-winner\" is a household's main economic contributor and has little to do with actual bread-provision. This is also seen in the phrase \"putting bread on the table\". The Roman poet Juvenal satirized superficial politicians and the public as caring only for \"\"panem et circenses\"\" (bread and circuses). In Russia in 1917, the Bolsheviks promised \"peace, land, and bread.\" The term \"breadbasket\" denotes an agriculturally productive region. In Slavic cultures bread and salt is offered as a welcome to guests. In India, life's basic necessities are often referred to as \"roti, kapra aur makan\" (bread, cloth, and house).\n\nWords for bread, including \"dough\" and \"bread\" itself, are used in English-speaking countries as synonyms for money. A remarkable or revolutionary innovation may be called the best thing since \"sliced bread\". The expression \"to break bread with someone\" means \"to share a meal with someone\". The English word \"lord\" comes from the Anglo-Saxon \"hlāfweard\", meaning \"bread keeper.\"\n\nBread is sometimes referred to as \"the staff of life\", although this term can refer to other staple foods in different cultures: the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines it as \"bread (or similar staple food)\". This is sometimes thought to be a biblical reference, but the nearest wording is in Leviticus 26 \"when I have broken the staff of your bread\". The term has been adopted in the names of bakery firms.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37354", "title": "Verb", "text": "Verb\n\nA verb, from the Latin \"verbum\" meaning \"word\", is a word (part of speech) that in syntax conveys an action (\"bring\", \"read\", \"walk\", \"run\", \"learn\"), an occurrence (\"happen\", \"become\"), or a state of being (\"be\", \"exist\", \"stand\"). In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle \"to\", is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice. A verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or object. Verbs have tenses: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate that an action has been done; future, to indicate that an action will be done.\n\nIn languages where the verb is inflected, it often agrees with its primary argument (the subject) in person, number or gender. With the exception of the verb \"to be\", English shows distinctive agreements only in the third person singular, present tense form of verbs, which are marked by adding \"-s\" ( \"walks) or \"-es\" (\"fishes). The rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb (\"I walk\", \"you walk\", \"they walk\", etc.).\n\nLatin and the Romance languages inflect verbs for tense–aspect–mood (abbreviated 'TAM'), and they agree in person and number (but not in gender, as for example in Polish) with the subject. Japanese, like many languages with SOV word order, inflects verbs for tense-aspect-mood, as well as other categories such as negation, but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject - it is a strictly dependent-marking language. On the other hand, Basque, Georgian, and some other languages, have \"polypersonal agreement\": the verb agrees with the subject, the direct object, and even the secondary object if present, a greater degree of head-marking than is found in most European languages.\n\nVerbs vary by type, and each type is determined by the kinds of words that accompany it and the relationship those words have with the verb itself. Classified by the number of their valency arguments, usually three basic types are distinguished: intransitives, transitives, ditransitives and double transitive verbs. Some verbs have special grammatical uses and hence complements, such as copular verbs (i.e., be); the verb \"do\" used for do-support in questioning and negation, and tense or aspect auxiliaries, e.g., \"be\", \"have\" or \"can\". In addition, verbs can be nonfinite, namely, not inflected for tense, and have various special forms such as infinitives, participles or gerunds.\n\nAn intransitive verb is one that does not have a direct object. Intransitive verbs may be followed by an adverb (a word that addresses how, where, when, and how often) or end a sentence. For example: \"The woman \"spoke\" softly.\" \"The athlete \"ran\" faster than the official.\" \"The boy \"wept\".\"\n\nA transitive verb is followed by a noun or noun phrase. These noun phrases are not called predicate nouns, but are instead called direct objects because they refer to the object that is being acted upon. For example: \"My friend \"read\" the newspaper.\" \"The teenager \"earned\" a speeding ticket.\"\n\nA way to identify a transitive verb is to invert the sentence, making it passive. For example: \"The newspaper \"was read\" by my friend.\" \"A speeding ticket \"was earned\" by the teenager.\"\n\nDitransitive verbs (sometimes called Vg verbs after the verb \"give\") precede either two noun phrases or a noun phrase and then a prepositional phrase often led by \"to\" or \"for\". For example: \"The players \"gave\" their teammates high fives.\" \"The players \"gave\" high fives to their teammates.\"\n\nWhen two noun phrases follow a transitive verb, the first is an indirect object, that which is receiving something, and the second is a direct object, that being acted upon. Indirect objects can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases.\n\nDouble transitive verbs (sometimes called Vc verbs after the verb \"consider\") are followed by a noun phrase that serves as a direct object and then a second noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive phrase. The second element (noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive) is called a complement, which completes a clause that would not otherwise have the same meaning. For example: \"The young couple \"considers\" the neighbors wealthy people.\" \"Some students \"perceive\" adults quite inaccurately.\" \"Sarah \"deemed\" her project to be the hardest she has ever completed.\"\n\nCopular verbs ( linking verbs) can't be followed by an adverb or end a sentence, but instead must be followed by a noun or adjective, whether in a single word or phrase. Common copulae include \"be\", \"seem\", \"become\", \"appear\", \"look\", and \"remain\". For example: \"His mother \"looked\" worried.\" \"Josh \"remained\" a reliable friend.\" Copulae are thought to 'link' the adjective or noun to the subject.\n\nThe copular verb \"be\" is manifested in eight forms: \"be\", \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"been\", and \"being\" in English. These verbs precede nouns or adjectives in a sentence, which become predicate nouns and predicate adjectives similar to those that function with a linking verb. They can also be followed by an adverb of place, which is sometimes referred to as a predicate adverb. For example: \"Her daughter \"was\" a writing tutor.\" \"The singers \"were\" very nervous.\" \"My house \"is\" down the street.\"\n\nAdjectives that come after copular verbs are predicate adjectives, and nouns that come after linking verbs are predicate nouns.\n\nThe number of arguments that a verb takes is called its \"valency\" or \"valence\". Verbs can be classified according to their valency:\nA few English verbs, particularly those concerned with financial transactions, take four arguments, as in \"Pat sold Chris a lawnmower for $20\" or \"Chris paid Pat $20 for a lawnmower\".\n\nWeather verbs often appear to be impersonal (subjectless, or avalent) in null-subject languages like Spanish, where the verb \"llueve\" means \"It rains\". In English, French and German, they require a dummy pronoun, and therefore formally have a valency of 1. However, as verbs in Spanish incorporate the subject as a TAM suffix, Spanish is not actually a null-subject language, unlike Mandarin (see above). Such verbs in Spanish also have a valency of 1.\n\nIntransitive and transitive verbs are the most common, but the impersonal and objective verbs are somewhat different from the norm. In the objective the verb takes an object but no subject; the nonreferent subject in some uses may be marked in the verb by an incorporated dummy pronoun similar to that used with the English weather verbs. Impersonal verbs in null subject languages take neither subject nor object, as is true of other verbs, but again the verb may show incorporated dummy pronouns despite the lack of subject and object phrases.\n\nVerbs are often flexible with regard to valency. In non-valency marking languages such as English, a transitive verb can often drop its object and become intransitive; or an intransitive verb can take an object and become transitive. For example, in English the verb \"move\" has no grammatical object in \"he moves\" (though in this case, the subject itself may be an implied object, also expressible explicitly as in \"he moves himself\"); but in \"he moves the car\", the subject and object are distinct and the verb has a different valency. Some verbs in English, however, have historically derived forms that show change of valency in some causative verbs, such as \"fall-fell-fallen\":\"fell-felled-felled\"; \"rise-rose-risen\":\"raise-raised-raised\"; \"cost-cost-cost\":\"cost-costed-costed\".\n\nIn valency marking languages, valency change is shown by inflecting the verb in order to change the valency. In Kalaw Lagaw Ya of Australia, for example, verbs distinguish valency by argument agreement suffixes and TAM endings:\n\"Verb structure:\" manga-i-[number]-TAM \"arrive+active+singular/dual/plural+TAM\"\n\"Verb structure:\" manga-Ø-[number]-TAM \"arrive+attainative+singular/dual/plural+TAM\"\n\nThe verb stem manga- 'to take/come/arrive' at the destination takes the active suffix -i (> mangai-) in the intransitive form, and as a transitive verb the stem is not suffixed. The TAM ending -nu is the general today past attainative perfective, found with all numbers in the perfective except the singular active, where -ma is found.\n\nDepending on the language, verbs may express \"grammatical tense\", \"aspect\", or \"modality\". Grammatical tense is the use of auxiliary verbs or inflections to convey whether the action or state is before, simultaneous with, or after some reference point. The reference point could be the time of utterance, in which case the verb expresses absolute tense, or it could be a past, present, or future time of reference previously established in the sentence, in which case the verb expresses relative tense.\n\nAspect expresses how the action or state occurs through time. Important examples include:\n\nAspect can either be lexical, in which case the aspect is embedded in the verb's meaning (as in \"the sun shines,\" where \"shines\" is lexically stative), or it can be grammatically expressed, as in \"I am running.\"\n\nModality expresses the speaker's attitude toward the action or state given by the verb, especially with regard to degree of necessity, obligation, or permission (\"You must go\", \"You should go\", \"You may go\"), determination or willingness (\"I will do this no matter what\"), degree of probability (\"It must be raining by now\", \"It may be raining\", \"It might be raining\"), or ability (\"I can speak French\"). All languages can express modality with adverbs, but some also use verbal forms as in the given examples. If the verbal expression of modality involves the use of an auxiliary verb, that auxiliary is called a modal verb. If the verbal expression of modality involves inflection, we have the special case of mood; moods include the indicative (as in \"I am there\"), the subjunctive (as in \"I wish I \"were\" there\"), and the imperative (\"Be there!\").\n\nThe voice of a verb expresses whether the subject of the verb is performing the action of the verb or whether the action is being performed on the subject. The two most common voices are the active voice (as in \"I saw the car\") and the passive voice (as in \"The car was seen by me\" or simply \"The car was seen\").\n\nMost languages have a number of verbal nouns that describe the action of the verb.\n\nIn the Indo-European languages, verbal adjectives are generally called participles. English has an active participle, also called a present participle; and a passive participle, also called a past participle. The active participle of \"break\" is \"breaking\", and the passive participle is \"broken\". \nOther languages have attributive verb forms with tense and aspect. This is especially common among verb-final languages, where attributive verb phrases act as relative clauses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37495", "title": "Noun", "text": "Noun\n\nA noun (from Latin \"nōmen\", literally meaning \"name\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. However, \"noun\" is not a semantic category, so that it cannot be characterized in terms of its meaning. Thus, actions and states of existence can also be expressed by verbs, qualities by adjectives, and places by adverbs. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.\n\nLexical categories (parts of speech) are defined in terms of the ways in which their members combine with other kinds of expressions. The syntactic rules for nouns differ from language to language. In English, nouns are those words which can occur with articles and attributive adjectives and can function as the head of a noun phrase.\n\nWord classes (parts of speech) were described by Sanskrit grammarians from at least the 5th century BC. In Yāska's \"Nirukta\", the noun (\"nāma\") is one of the four main categories of words defined.\n\nThe Ancient Greek equivalent was \"ónoma\" (ὄνομα), referred to by Plato in the \"Cratylus\" dialog, and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in \"The Art of Grammar\", attributed to Dionysius Thrax (2nd century BC). The term used in Latin grammar was \"nōmen\". All of these terms for \"noun\" were also words meaning \"name\". The English word \"noun\" is derived from the Latin term, through the Anglo-Norman \"noun\".\n\nThe word classes were defined partly by the grammatical forms that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by gender and inflected for case and number. Because adjectives share these three grammatical categories, adjectives are placed in the same class as nouns.\n\nSimilarly, the Latin \"nōmen\" includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word \"noun\", the two types being distinguished as \"nouns substantive\" and \"nouns adjective\" (or \"substantive nouns\" and \"adjective nouns\", or short \"substantives\" and \"adjectives\"). (The word \"nominal\" is now sometimes used to denote a class that includes both nouns and adjectives.)\n\nMany European languages use a cognate of the word \"substantive\" as the basic term for noun (for example, Spanish \"sustantivo\", \"noun\"). Nouns in the dictionaries of such languages are demarked by the abbreviation \"s.\" or \"sb.\" instead of \"n.\", which may be used for proper nouns or neuter nouns instead. In English, some modern authors use the word \"substantive\" to refer to a class that includes both nouns (single words) and noun phrases (multiword units, also called noun equivalents). It can also be used as a counterpart to \"attributive\" when distinguishing between a noun being used as the head (main word) of a noun phrase and a noun being used as a noun adjunct. For example, the noun \"knee\" can be said to be used substantively in \"my knee hurts\", but attributively in \"the patient needed knee replacement\".\n\nNouns have sometimes been defined in terms of the grammatical categories to which they are subject (classed by gender, inflected for case and number). Such definitions tend to be language-specific, since nouns do not have the same categories in all languages.\n\nNouns are frequently defined, particularly in informal contexts, in terms of their semantic properties (their meanings). Nouns are described as words that refer to a \"person\", \"place\", \"thing\", \"event\", \"substance\", \"quality\", \"quantity\", etc. However this type of definition has been criticized by contemporary linguists as being uninformative.\n\nThere have been offered several examples of English-language nouns which do not have any reference: \"drought\", \"enjoyment\", \"finesse\", \"behalf\" (as found in \"on behalf of\"), \"dint\" (\"in dint of\"), and \"sake\" (\"for the sake of\"). Moreover, there may be a relationship similar to reference in the case of other parts of speech: the verbs \"to rain\" or \"to mother\"; many adjectives, like \"red\"; and there is little difference between the adverb \"gleefully\" and the noun-based phrase \"with glee\".\n\nThere are placeholder names, such as the legal fiction \"reasonable person\" (whose existence is not in question), an experimental \"artifact\", or personifications such as \"gremlin\".\n\nLinguists often prefer to define nouns (and other lexical categories) in terms of their formal properties. These include morphological information, such as what prefixes or suffixes they take, and also their syntax – how they combine with other words and expressions of particular types. Such definitions may nonetheless still be language-specific, since syntax as well as morphology varies between languages. For example, in English it might be noted that nouns are words that can co-occur with definite articles (as stated at the start of this article), but this would not apply in Russian, which has no definite articles.\n\nThere have been several attempts, sometimes controversial, to produce a stricter definition of nouns on a semantic basis. Some of these are referenced in the section below.\n\nIn some languages, genders are assigned to nouns, such as masculine, feminine and neuter. The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often entail agreement in words that modify or are related to it. For example, in French, the singular form of the definite article is \"le\" with masculine nouns and \"la\" with feminines; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (with the addition of with feminines). Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both Italian and Russian most nouns ending are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the sex of the noun's referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals). Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex (or \"social gender\"), and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The girl lost her spectacles.)\n\nA \"proper noun\" or \"proper name\" is a noun representing unique entities (such as \"India\", \"Pegasus\", \"Jupiter\", \"Kaumarya saurav\", \"Confucius\", or \"Pequod\"), as distinguished from common nouns which describe a class of entities (such as \"country\", \"animal\", \"planet\", \"person\" or \"ship\").\n\n\"Count nouns\" or \"countable nouns\" are common nouns that can take a plural, can combine with numerals or counting quantifiers (e.g., \"one\", \"two\", \"several\", \"every\", \"most\"), and can take an indefinite article such as \"a\" or \"an\" (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are \"chair\", \"nose\", and \"occasion\".\n\n\"Mass nouns\" or \"uncountable\" (or \"non-count\") \"nouns\" differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers. For example, it is not possible to refer to \"a furniture\" or \"three furnitures\". This is true even though the pieces of furniture comprising \"furniture\" could be counted. Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made in terms of what sorts of things the nouns refer to, but rather in terms of how the nouns \"present\" these entities.\n\nMany nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, \"soda\" is countable in \"give me three sodas\", but uncountable in \"he likes soda\".\n\n\"Collective nouns\" are nouns that – even when they are inflected for the singular – refer to \"groups\" consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include \"committee\", \"government\", and \"police\". In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun, the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in \"Plain Words\" include:\n\n\"Concrete nouns\" refer to physical entities that can, in principle at least \"(i.e. different schools of philosophy and sciences may question the assumption, but, for the most part, people agree to the existence of something. E.g. a rock, a tree, universe)\", be observed by at least one of the senses (for instance, \"chair\", \"apple\", \"Janet\" or \"atom\"). \"Abstract nouns\", on the other hand, refer to abstract objects; that is, ideas or concepts (such as \"justice\" or \"hatred\"). While this distinction is sometimes exclusive, some nouns have multiple senses, including both concrete and abstract ones: consider, for example, the noun \"art\", which usually refers to a concept (e.g., \"Art is an important element of human culture.\") but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain contexts (e.g., \"I put my daughter's art up on the fridge.\")\n\nSome abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots. These include \"drawback\", \"fraction\", \"holdout\" and \"uptake\". Similarly, some nouns have both abstract and concrete senses, with the latter having developed by figurative extension from the former. These include \"view\", \"filter\", \"structure\" and \"key\".\n\nIn English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding a suffix (\"-ness\", \"-ity\", \"-ion\") to adjectives or verbs. Examples are \"happiness\" (from the adjective \"happy\"), \"circulation\" (from the verb \"circulate\") and \"serenity\" (from the adjective \"serene\").\n\nSome languages refer to nouns differently, depending on how ownership is being given for the given noun. This can be broken into two categories: alienable and inalienable. An alienable noun is something that does not belong to a person indefinitely. Inalienable nouns, on the other hand, refer to something that is possessed definitely. Examples of alienable nouns would be a tree or a shirt or roads. Examples of inalienable nouns would be a father or shadow or hair.\n\nThe Pingelapese language uses a distinction between nouns. There are several classifier forms: The first is for objects which tend to be pretty large in size and not being a favorite possession (tree or shirt), and the second is for small, controllable, favorite objects like dogs, books or spears. A third form would be set aside for food objects like bananas, oranges or fish. Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have classifier forms. A fifth classifier would be designated for things that are to be chewed but not fully consumed. The only example of this was from the book \"Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic\": the fruit, pandanus, is chewed for the sweet/bitter juice, but what remains after consuming the juice discarded. The 6th classifier forms are set aside for ways of transportation (bikes, canoes, and boats). The last two classifiers are designated for land and houses.\n\nA noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun, pronoun, or other noun-like word (nominal) optionally accompanied by modifiers such as determiners and adjectives. A noun phrase functions within a clause or sentence in a role such as that of subject, object, or complement of a verb or preposition. For example, in the sentence \"The black cat sat on a dear friend of mine\", the noun phrase \"the black cat\" serves as the subject, and the noun phrase \"a dear friend of mine\" serves as the complement of the preposition \"on\".\n\nNouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by pronouns, such as \"he\", \"it\", \"which\", and \"those\", in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons. For example, in the sentence \"Gareth thought that he was weird\", the word \"he\" is a pronoun standing in place of the person's name. The word \"one\" can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun. An example is given below:\n\nBut \"one\" can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, \"one\" can stand in for \"new car\".\n\nNominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun.\nIn French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:\n\n\n\n\nFor definitions of nouns based on the concept of \"identity criteria\":\n\nFor more on identity criteria:\n\nFor the concept that nouns are \"prototypically referential\":\n\nFor an attempt to relate the concepts of identity criteria and prototypical referentiality:\n\nUnderstanding nouns in the context of WordNet:\n\n"}
{"id": "37512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37512", "title": "Adjective", "text": "Adjective\n\nIn linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is word whose main syntactic role is to modify a noun or noun phrase. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun. \n\nAdjectives are one of the English parts of speech, although they were historically classed together with the nouns. Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives, including \"the\", \"this\", \"my\", etc., are today usually classed separately, as determiners.\n\n\"Adjective\" comes from Latin \"\" \"additional (noun)\", a calque of . In the grammatical tradition of Latin and Greek, because adjectives were inflected for gender, number, and case like nouns (a process called declension), they were considered a subtype of noun. The words that are today typically called nouns were then called \"substantive nouns\" (\"nōmen substantīvum\"). The terms \"noun substantive\" and \"noun adjective\" were formerly used in English, but the terms are now obsolete.\n\nA given occurrence of an adjective can generally be classified into one of three kinds of use:\n\nAdjectives feature as a part of speech (word class) in most languages. In some languages, the words that serve the semantic function of adjectives are categorized together with some other class, such as nouns or verbs. In the phrase \"a Ford car\", \"Ford\" is unquestionably a noun, but its function is adjectival: to modify \"car\". In some languages adjectives can function as nouns: \"uno rojo\", \"a red (object)\" (Span.). As for \"confusion\" with verbs, rather than an adjective meaning \"big\", a language might have a verb that means \"to be big\", and could then use an attributive verb construction analogous to \"big-being house\" to express what English expresses as \"big house\". Such an analysis is possible for the grammar of Standard Chinese, for example.\n\nDifferent languages do not always use adjectives in exactly the same situations. For example, where English uses \"to be hungry\" (\"hungry\" being an adjective), Dutch, French, and Spanish use \"honger hebben\", \"avoir faim\", and \"tener hambre\" respectively (literally \"to have hunger\", the words for \"hunger\" being nouns). Similarly, where Hebrew uses the adjective זקוק \"zaqūq\" (roughly \"in need of\"), English uses the verb \"to need\".\n\nIn languages which have adjectives as a word class, they are usually an open class; that is, it is relatively common for new adjectives to be formed via such processes as derivation. However, Bantu languages are well known for having only a small closed class of adjectives, and new adjectives are not easily derived. Similarly, native Japanese adjectives (\"i\"-adjectives) are considered a closed class (as are native verbs), although nouns (an open class) may be used in the genitive to convey some adjectival meanings, and there is also the separate open class of adjectival nouns (\"na\"-adjectives).\n\nMany languages, including English, distinguish between adjectives, which qualify nouns and pronouns, and adverbs, which mainly modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Not all languages have exactly this distinction and many languages, including English, have words that can function as both. For example, in English, \"fast\" is an adjective in \"a fast car\" (where it qualifies the noun \"car\"), but an adverb in \"he drove fast\" (where it modifies the verb \"drove\").\n\nIn Dutch and German, adjectives and adverbs are usually identical in form and many grammarians do not make the distinction, but patterns of inflection can suggest a difference:\nA German word like \"klug\" (\"clever(ly)\") takes endings when used as an attributive adjective, but not when used adverbially. (It also takes no endings when used as a predicative adjective: \"er ist klug\", \"he is clever\".) Whether these are distinct parts of speech or distinct usages of the same part of speech is a question of analysis. It can be noted that while German linguistic terminology distinguishes \"adverbiale\" from \"adjektivische Formen\", German refers to both as \"Eigenschaftswörter\" (\"property words\").\n\nLinguists today distinguish determiners from adjectives, considering them to be two separate parts of speech (or \"lexical categories\"), but formerly determiners were considered to be adjectives in some of their uses. In English dictionaries, which typically still do not treat determiners as their own part of speech, determiners are often recognizable by being listed both as adjectives and as pronouns. Determiners are words that are neither nouns nor pronouns, yet reference a thing already in context. Determiners generally do this by indicating definiteness (as in \"a\" vs. \"the\"), quantity (as in \"one\" vs. \"some\" vs. \"many\"), or another such property.\n\nAn adjective acts as the head of an \"adjective phrase\" or \"adjectival phrase\" (AP). In the simplest case, an adjective phrase consists solely of the adjective; more complex adjective phrases may contain one or more adverbs modifying the adjective (\"\"very\" strong\"), or one or more complements (such as \"worth \"several dollars\"\", \"full \"of toys\"\", or \"eager \"to please\"\"). In English, attributive adjective phrases that include complements typically follow the noun that they qualify (\"an evildoer \"devoid of redeeming qualities\"\").\n\nIn many languages, including English, it is possible for nouns to modify other nouns. Unlike adjectives, nouns acting as modifiers (called \"attributive nouns\" or \"noun adjuncts\") usually are not predicative; a beautiful park is beautiful, but a car park is not \"car\". The modifier often indicates origin (\"\"Virginia\" reel\"), purpose (\"\"work\" clothes\"), semantic patient (\"\"man\" eater\") or semantic subject (\"\"child\" actor\"); however, it may generally indicate almost any semantic relationship. It is also common for adjectives to be derived from nouns, as in \"boyish\", \"birdlike\", \"behavioral (behavioural)\", \"famous\", \"manly\", \"angelic\", and so on.\n\nMany languages have special verbal forms called participles that can act as noun modifiers (alone or as the head of a phrase). Sometimes participles develop into pure adjectives. Examples of this in English include \"relieved\" (the past participle of the verb \"relieve\", used as an adjective in sentences such as \"I am so relieved to see you\"), \"spoken\" (as in \"the spoken word\"), and \"going\" (the present participle of the verb \"go\", used as an adjective in such phrases as \"the going rate\").\n\nOther constructs that often modify nouns include prepositional phrases (as in \"a rebel \"without a cause\"\"), relative clauses (as in \"the man \"who wasn't there\"\"), and infinitive phrases (as in \"a cake \"to die for\"\"). Some nouns can also take complements such as content clauses (as in \"the idea \"that I would do that\"\"), but these are not commonly considered modifiers. For more information about possible modifiers and dependents of nouns, see Components of noun phrases.\n\nIn many languages, attributive adjectives usually occur in a specific order. In general, the adjective order in English can be summarised as: opinion, size, age or shape, colour, origin, material, purpose. This sequence (with age preceding shape) is sometimes referred to by the mnemonic OSASCOMP. Other language authorities, like the \"Cambridge Dictionary\", alternatively state that shape precedes rather than follows age.\n\nThis means that in English, adjectives pertaining to size precede adjectives pertaining to age (\"little old\", not \"old little\"), which in turn generally precede adjectives pertaining to color (\"old white\", not \"white old\"). So, one would say \"One (quantity) nice (opinion) little (size) old (age) round (shape) [\"or\" round old] white (color) brick (material) house.\" When several adjectives of the same type are used together, they are ordered from general to specific, like \"lovely intelligent person\" or \"old medieval castle\".\n\nThis order may be more rigid in some languages than others; in some, like Spanish, it may only be a default (\"unmarked\") word order, with other orders being permissible. Other languages, such as Tagalog, follow their adjectival orders as rigidly as English.\n\nThe normal adjectival order of English may be overridden in certain circumstances, especially when one adjective is being fronted. In addition, the usual order of adjectives in English would result in the phrase \"the bad big wolf\" (opinion before size), but instead the usual phrase is \"the big bad wolf\", perhaps because the ablaut reduplication rule that high vowels precede low vowels overrides the normal order of adjectives.\n\nOwing partially to borrowings from French, English has some adjectives that follow the noun as postmodifiers, called postpositive adjectives, as in \"time immemorial\" and \"attorney general\". Adjectives may even change meaning depending on whether they precede or follow, as in \"proper\": \"They live in a proper town\" (a real town, not a village) vs. \"They live in the town proper\" (in the town itself, not in the suburbs). All adjectives can follow nouns in certain constructions, such as \"tell me something new\".\n\nIn many languages, some adjectives are \"comparable\" and the measure of comparison is called \"degree\". For example, a person may be \"polite\", but another person may be \"more polite\", and a third person may be the \"most polite\" of the three. The word \"more\" here modifies the adjective \"polite\" to indicate a comparison is being made, and \"most\" modifies the adjective to indicate an absolute comparison (a \"superlative\").\n\nAmong languages that allow adjectives to be compared, different means are used to indicate comparison. Some languages do not distinguish between comparative and superlative forms.\n\nIn English, many adjectives can take the suffixes \"-er\" and \"-est\" (sometimes requiring additional letters before the suffix; see forms for \"far\" below) to indicate the comparative and superlative forms, respectively:\n\nSome adjectives are \"irregular\" in this sense:\n\nSome adjectives can have both \"regular\" and \"irregular\" variations:\n\nalso\n\nAnother way to convey comparison is by incorporating the words \"more\" and \"most\". There is no simple rule to decide which means is correct for any given adjective, however. The general tendency is for simpler adjectives, and those from Anglo-Saxon to take the suffixes, while longer adjectives and those from French, Latin, Greek do not—but sometimes \"sound\" of the word is the deciding factor.\n\nMany adjectives do not naturally lend themselves to comparison. For example, some English speakers would argue that it does not make sense to say that one thing is \"more ultimate\" than another, or that something is \"most ultimate\", since the word \"ultimate\" is already absolute in its semantics. Such adjectives are called \"non-comparable\" or \"absolute\". Nevertheless, native speakers will frequently play with the raised forms of adjectives of this sort. Although \"pregnant\" is logically non-comparable (either one is pregnant or not), one may hear a sentence like \"She looks more and more pregnant each day\". Likewise \"extinct\" and \"equal\" appear to be non-comparable, but one might say that a language about which nothing is known is \"more extinct\" than a well-documented language with surviving literature but no speakers, while George Orwell wrote \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\". These cases may be viewed as evidence that the base forms of these adjectives are not as absolute in their semantics as is usually thought.\n\nComparative and superlative forms are also occasionally used for other purposes than comparison. In English comparatives can be used to suggest that a statement is only tentative or tendential: one might say \"John is more the shy-and-retiring type,\" where the comparative \"more\" is not really comparing him with other people or with other impressions of him, but rather, could be substituting for \"on the whole\". In Italian, superlatives are frequently used to put strong emphasis on an adjective: \"Bellissimo\" means \"most beautiful\", but is in fact more commonly heard in the sense \"extremely beautiful\".\n\nAttributive adjectives, and other noun modifiers, may be used either \"restrictively\" (helping to identify the noun's referent, hence \"restricting\" its reference) or \"non-restrictively\" (helping to describe an already-identified noun). For example:\n\nIn some languages, such as Spanish, restrictiveness is consistently marked; for example, in Spanish \"la tarea difícil\" means \"the difficult task\" in the sense of \"the task that is difficult\" (restrictive), whereas \"la difícil tarea\" means \"the difficult task\" in the sense of \"the task, which is difficult\" (non-restrictive). In English, restrictiveness is not marked on adjectives, but is marked on relative clauses (the difference between \"the man \"who recognized me\" was there\" and \"the man, \"who recognized me\", was there\" being one of restrictiveness).\n\nIn some languages, adjectives alter their form to reflect the gender, case and number of the noun that they describe. This is called agreement or concord. Usually it takes the form of inflections at the end of the word, as in Latin:\n\nIn Celtic languages, however, initial consonant lenition marks the adjective with a feminine singular noun, as in Irish:\n\nOften, distinction is made here between attributive and predicative usage. In English, adjectives never agree, and in French, they always agree. In German, they agree only when they are used attributively, and in Hungarian, they agree only when they are used predicatively:\n\n\n\n"}
