It is a celebration that has become a vibrant part of African American history and culture. As with other traditions, practices, customs and norms of African American culture, this ritual for dealing with death was shaped by the African American experience.\n\nThe history of the homegoing service can be traced back to the arrival of African slaves in America. Early during the slave trade, slaves believed death meant their soul would return home to their native Africa. They were not allowed to congregate to perform any kind of ritual for burying the dead because slave owners were fearful the slaves would conspire to create an uprising during any such gathering. Later, in an effort to control the slave population, slave owners introduced slaves to Protestantism to placate and subdue them.\n\nThe Old Testament stories of God and Moses freeing a captive and enslaved race resonated with the slaves. The New Testament stories of Jesus and promises of glory in heaven and a far better after-life allowed slaves to forge through the turmoil of mortal life and look forward to the day when they would return home to the Lord. They fully embraced Christianity and death, for slaves, was viewed as freedom. Their death rituals were jubilant and it became one of the earliest forms of African American culture.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century there were few, if any black-owned or black-managed funeral homes. Survivors of deceased blacks were forced to depend on white funeral homes for embalming if they would even agree to service them. Jim Crow laws and white bias required blacks to enter these white funeral homes through back doors and basements, a degrading experience that added to the tragedy of losing a loved one.\n\nAlthough the embalming was mostly done by white funeral homes, the homegoing service took place in the black Christian church. The churches began forming burial societies to collect money for funerals. Black businessmen who opened funeral homes during the early-to-mid-twentieth century saw not only a business opportunity, but a way to help the community. Funeral parlors were among some of the first black-owned businesses and the black funeral director was a trusted friend and neighbor in the community. The tradition of the black community funeral director and the support of the black Christian church exists in many black communities today.\n\nA homegoing service follows many of the same practices as a funeral service. There are pall bearers and flowers and the service is typically held in a Christian church. But, because African-American Christians believe death marks the return to the Lord and an end to the pain and suffering of mortal life, the homegoing service is an occasion marked by rejoicing because the deceased is going on to a better place.\n\nA homegoing service usually contains some or all of these elements:\n\n\nA homegoing service is sometimes reminiscent of an African-American Christian church service. In addition to the eulogy, there is often a sermon and a choir that sings gospel hymns. The service often allows for friends and family to speak briefly about their remembrances of the deceased. Homegoing Service goers may experience both mourning and rejoicing.\n\n\n\n"}

After 1920, when mixing machines became popular among bakers, rural bakers began to make more sponge doughs and city bakers more straight doughs, both replacing sourdough. By the 1930s, straight dough had mostly replaced sponge dough, and the terms \"French\" and \"Vienna\" breads were used less often. Bakers who continued using older methods were generally unable in America to compete on a cost basis, and so with \"rare exceptions,\" were limited to local niche markets.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Nalgonda district, the item is known as \"tappala chekka\", while in Karimnagar it is known as \"sarva pindi\". \"Ganju\" means utensil or a round shaped bowl and \"pindi\" means flour in Telugu language. So, the phrase \"Ganju Pindi\" can be described as rice flour that is made like atta flour and stick to the round shaped pan. In Warangal, the dish is known as \"ginnappa\". The village Bollepally in Warangal district is particularly famous for ginnappa (sarva pindi), as the story about ginnappa first originated from the Challa Anasurya house in the village. A few years back, Anasurya was feeling very hungry in rainy season, but desired a new dish with less oil. As she had only rice flour in her home at the time, this led to the creation of the sarva pindi snack. She began to sell some in Bollepally village,Telangana district, With help of persons for some days like that entire telugu people came to know about sarva pindi snack.\n\nSarva pindi is essentially made of rice flour, channa dal (lentil), peanuts and spices, making it a delicious and healthy dish.\n\nThe word Sarva Pindi comes from a combination of two terms: \"sarva\", meaning a deep pot or pan; and \"appa\", meaning a cake-sort of preparation. Therefore, the direct translation of Sarva pindi is the \"pan cake\". The Sarva Pindi pancake is one of the ethnic dishes from the Telangana cuisine; which, although it was once deemed underrated rustic, spicy, and pungent cuisine, is now getting the recognition it truly deserves.\n\nIt is recognized as one of the Telangana Traditional cuisines.\n"}

Its preparation and consumption dates back to ancient history, and it originated in the coastal area known as the Maremma in southern Tuscany and northern Lazio. The dish was invented in part as a means to make hardened, stale bread edible. In contemporary times, ingredients can vary, and additional ingredients are sometimes used. Variations of the dish include \"Aquacotta con funghi\" and \"Aquacotta con peperoni\".\n\nAcquacotta is a simple traditional dish originating in the coastal region of Italy known as Maremma, which spans the southern half of Tuscany's coast and runs into northern Lazio. The word \"acquacotta\" means \"cooked water\" in the Italian language. It was originally a peasant food, and has been described as an ancient dish, the recipe of which was derived in part by people who lived in the Tuscan forest working as colliers (charcoal burners), who were typically very poor, being \"traditionally among the poorest of people\". It was also prepared and consumed by farmers and shepherds in the Maremma area. Historically, the soup was sometimes served as an antipasto dish, the first course in an Italian meal. It remains a popular dish in Maremma and throughout Italy.\n\nAcquacotta was invented in part as a means to make stale, hardened bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.\n\nA legend about acquacotta exists in relation to the concept of stone soup, which is generally based upon a premise of a poor traveler who arrived at a village having only a stone, but convinced the villagers to add ingredients to his stone soup, creating acquacotta; variations of the legend exist.\n\nHistorically, acquacotta's primary ingredients were water, stale bread, onion, tomato and olive oil, along with various vegetables and leftover foods that may have been available. In the earlier 1800s, some preparations used \"agresto\", a juice derived from half-ripened grapes, in place of tomatoes, which were not a common food in Italy prior to \"the latter decades of the nineteenth century\".\n\nContemporary preparations of acquacotta may use stale, fresh, or toasted bread, and can include additional ingredients such as vegetable broth, eggs, cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Toscano, celery, garlic, basil, beans such as cannellini beans, cabbage, kale, lemon juice, salt, pepper, potatoes and others. Some versions may use edible mushrooms such as porcini, wild herbs, and leaf vegetables/greens such as arugula, endive, mint, chard, chicory, dandelion greens, watercress, valerian and others. As the greens boil down, they contribute to the broth's flavor. The dish may be topped with a poached egg. Contemporary versions may be prepared in advance from a few hours to a day, stored in a cold place or refrigerated, and then reheated prior to serving. It can also be preserved by freezing.\n\n\"Acquacotta con funghi\" is an aquacotta soup variation that uses porcini mushrooms as a primary ingredient. Additional ingredients include bread, stock or water, tomato \"conserva\", Parmesan cheese, eggs, \"mentuccia\", wild mint, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.

Mützig is considered a flagship African brand.\n\nMützig's slogan is \"Mützig, the Taste of Success\" in English and \"Mützig, Le gout de la Réussite\" in French.\n\nThe name Mützig originates from Mutzig, a commune of France located at the entrance of the Bruche river valley, in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace, in north-eastern France. Brasserie Mutzig was founded in 1810 by Antoine Wagner and the beer was brewed there until the brewery closed in 1989, after merging into (Albra) in 1969, and being acquired by Heineken in 1972. The 1969 merger forming l'Alsacienne de Brasserie (Alsatian Brewery), combined Mutzig with the Alsatian breweries: de l'Espérance, de la Perle, de Colmar, and Haag à Ingwiller.

In 2015, carers provided around 1.9 billion hours of unpaid care. According to a new study by the University of Queensland, Australian carers are providing $13.2 billion worth of free mental health support to their friends and family members. This \"hidden workforce\" is an equivalent of 173,000 full-time mental health support workers.\n\nIn Australia they also have The Australian National Young Carers Action Team (ANYCAT) whose goal is to advocate on behalf of young carers (Being young carers themselves) each board member is the sole representative of their state or territory and represent as few as 75 000 Young Carers.\nIn Most states and Territories they have an ANYCAT equivalent team or Board. In Queensland this is called Young Carers Action Board Queensland (YCABQ).\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics of China 2011 report regarding China’s total population and structural changes, people belong to the age group of 60 years and above accounted for 184.99 million, which occupied 13.7 percent of the total national population at the end of 2011. The number has risen 0.47 percentage point comparing to the year of 2010. Of these, people age 65 years and above figured up 122.88 million that occupied 9.1 percent of the total and has increased 0.25 percentage points.\n\nAs a steadily increasing older population with a growing demand for long-term care, an issue of lacking of elderly care facilities as well as inadequate training for skilled caregivers has generated a social concern pertaining to elder care. According to the official Chinese media Xinhua, professionally qualified caregivers are in great request with approximately 10 million people needed to provide care for the Chinese aging population. However, the report also stated that only 300,000 people currently working as caregivers with less than 1/3 of them are trained properly.\n\nThere is no organized caregiver association in China. As a result, family members still construct the major source of caregiving in China especially in rural area where the quality of health services is a problem. A recent study aims to examine the effect of depression on family members of whom sons and daughters-in-law carry out main responsibilities in caring for elderly parents have indicated several findings, including:\n\n\nMore recently, another Caregiver Reaction Assessment was conducted in China with a purpose to analyze the reliability and validity among family caregivers of cancer patients. The study recruited 400 participants from the Second Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang with 312 family caregivers completed the survey. This study tried to measure caregiving experience from five aspects: disrupted schedule, financial problems, lack of family support, health problems, and self-esteem. The results indicated that the Chinese version of caregiving is profoundly influenced by the conception of Confucianism that emphasizes filial piety and guides the traditional caregiving ideology. Furthermore, the average age of adult children provide care is 46 years old of whom the majorities still work to support the family. As such, adult children sometimes bear significant physical and mental strain when their personal schedule and life activities are negatively impacted.\n\nWhen compared to all other countries Italy has the highest percentage of residents who are age 65 and older. The life expectancy for males is 76.7 and 82.9 for females, and it is predicted that by 2050 these numbers will reach 81 and 86 years, for men and women respectively. In addition, the country is faced with a rapidly growing older population and a shortage of younger individuals. Furthermore, the Minister of Labor and Social Policies of Italy stated that the family plays the most important role in the quality of life of elders, and it is the primary care provider for the older populations; however, the government also provides assistance to the family care giver by the following services:\nThe family plays an important role in providing care to its older parents but many children still have to work so that they can survive financially and as a result many caregivers are immigrant workers. These immigrant workers come in search of work from many parts of the world such as Moldavia, the Philippines, and Peru; however, the largest population of immigrant workers come from the Ukraine. Many of the caregivers work long hours and weeks, and also leave their own families behind and send them the money they make.\n\nTaiwan Today reports that currently in Taiwan only 72,000 seniors, about one third of those receiving long-term care, live in nursing institutes. The rest are taken care of by family members. Chen indicates that there were 600,000 family caregivers in Taiwan and they spent an average of 13.55 hours a day caregiving. 80 percent of these 600,000 family caregivers encountered limitations on social activities. 70 percent of them needed to take care of patients even when they did not feel well. He also mentions that 80 percent of family caregivers are women, and 50 percent of them are over 50 years old. Women are more likely to be regarded as natural caregivers because of gender expectations. Taiwanese females take care of children and spouses with chronicle illnesses to meet social norms and maintain filial piety. Among the family caregivers in Taiwan, some of them suffer from guilt, depression, nervousness, and injuries, sleeplessness, and hopelessness. Thus, it is a very essential task to promote the capabilities of family caregivers and improve their life quality.\n\nAccording to Carers UK, and based on the 2001 census around six million people in the UK provide care on an unpaid basis for a relative, friend or neighbour in need of support due to old age, disability, frailty or illness. The population of carers is dynamic: at least a third of all people will fulfil a caring role at some point in their lives.\n\nResearch has shown that becoming a carer can have many impacts on a person's life. These include financial costs, exclusion and discrimination at work, social isolation and poor health through stress and physical injury.\n\nAt least half of all carers are in full or part-time employment and some care for more than one person. Carers save the UK economy an estimated £87bn a year, and economic considerations form a key element in government policy to support carers.\n\nThe 2001 Census indicated that there are 175,000 young carers aged under 18 in the UK today. A poll commissioned by The Princess Royal Trust for Carers in 2004 indicates that the number of young carers could be much higher.\n\nPolicy and legislation in relation to caregivers living in Scotland is somewhat different from that in England, Wales and Ireland. Carers are defined by the Scottish Census as being \"individuals who look after, or give any help or support to family members, friends, neighbours and others because of long-term physical or mental ill health or disability or problems related to old age\" (Scotland’s Census Results Online [SCROL]). Estimates from the 2001 census put the numbers of carers in Scotland at 481,579. Of these, 175,969 are reported to provide more than 20 hours of care a week, and 24% provide more than 50 hours of care.\n\nCarers who provide care for 20 hours a week or more are regarded as being at the ‘heavy end’ of caring (Parker 1990). This assumes that they are the most involved carers, providing both personal and physical care, resulting in high levels of stress and most in need of support services. Many of these carers continue to provide care without support from social work or health services and because of this they remain hidden or invisible (Scottish Executive 2006, Cavaye 2006).\n\nCarers are viewed by the government as an important resource and in recent years have been given increasing recognition in health and social care policy. Since devolution in 1999 legislation and policy for caregivers has been developed by the former Scottish Executive (now Scottish Government).\n\nCarers in Scotland are regarded as ‘partners’ in the provision of care. As a result, support services provided to carers are regarded as part of the overall package of care to the person being looked after. This means that carers are not seen as service users and are therefore not responsible for the cost of any service provided. The exception to this is when a carer is looking after their partner; in that situation their income may be taken into account during a financial assessment.\n\nThis situation is different from that which exists in England where carers are viewed as services users in their own right and as such are liable for the cost of services provided. Yet, in many cases, it is not the carer who actually needs the service; it is the person being cared for who needs it because of their illness or disability.\n\nThe average life expectancy in the Ukraine is 61 for men and 72 for women, and as of 2005 Ukraine’s population is about 48 million of whom 15% are 65 and older. Older adults who cannot take care of themselves rely on family members, humanitarian organizations, government programs, or a combination of the three sources. According to the United Nations the Ukrainian Institute of Gerontology completed a study in 1998 which included 8,574 adults of retirement age, and the results demonstrated that older adults rely on older spouses, relatives or others, and departments of community social centers for care. In addition, 10 percent of the participants had an agreement with their caregiver(s) to trade inheritance of their property for the care that they were receiving. The United Nations also describes the very underfunded and understaffed situation of the country, which has effected the quality of services available to elders. For example, they mention that some 38,000 social workers provide care to about 500,000 older adults in need, and a total of 631 community centers and 131 social welfare units are available to provide support for the older population throughout the country. In addition to limited government and local resources many of those who could be caregivers to family members or others in the community choose to migrate to Italy.\n\nThe declining standards of living, economy, and production in the country of Ukraine could be contributing to the migration of Ukrainians to Italy and other countries abroad. It is estimated that there are close to 700,000 undocumented and approximately 195,000 legal working Ukrainian immigrants in Italy and a majority of them work as caregivers. Fedyuk mentions that many of those who move to Italy do not speak the language, work unregulated hours, may be underpaid, and usually are not prepared for all the physical and psychological requirements of being a caregiver. For instance, Fedyuk describes the working requirements of a 51-year-old caregiver who only had a 2-hour break during a single day and one day off a week. Also, there is mention of a 49-year-old woman who arrived to her new job and was not told the \"granny\" she would be caring for had an amputated arm and leg, was blind and could not speak. Those who migrate to Italy usually leave behind families and parents who require care themselves, and this puts further stress and pressure on the individual. Further research should be done in order to examine the extent of the consequences that may result to the caregiver, receiver of care, and those who are left behind in the cases of migrant Ukrainian workers.\n\nAccording to a November, 2007 survey on family caregiving, most family caregivers feel more positive about their experiences than they did just before they took on the responsibility, with significant differences in expectation prior to becoming a caregiver and the actual experience.\n\nThe survey also found that caregivers are often burdened by high out-of-pocket costs in caring for a spouse or parent, but:\n\nAccording to the Caregiver statistics fact sheet (2012) 43.5 million of adult family caregivers care for someone 50+ years of age and 14.9 million care for someone who has Alzheimer's disease or other dementia [Alzheimer's Association, 2011 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer's and Dementia, Vol. 7, Issue 2]. The number of male caregivers may be increasing and will continue to do so due to a variety of social demographic factors [Kramer, B. J. & E. H. Thompson, (eds.), \"Men as Caregivers,\" (New York:Prometheus Books, 2002]. Retrieved from.\n\nDellman-Jenkins, Blankemeyer and Pinkard found that young adults are increasingly becoming caregivers to their elderly relatives because of economic factors. A new population of caregivers to elderly are children and grandchildren, aged 40 years and younger, serving as the major source of support to an older relative(s). Retrieved from \n\nOther information about US caregivers:\nBy 2009, more than 61.6 million people provided unpaid care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged family member or friend at an estimated value of $450 billion.\n\n1.4 million children ages 8 to 18 provide care for an adult relative; 72% are caring for a parent or grandparent, although most are not the sole caregiver.\n\n30% of family caregivers caring for older individuals are themselves aged 65 or over; another 15% are between the ages of 45 to 54.\n\nLicensing and certification for caregiving can vary by state. In some states, the only licensing needed is by the company that employs the caregivers (unless it is from the state). In other states, an online certification course is recommended. Some states require in-classroom certification, and others require personal care licensing, which can be applied for online. Along with that, in some states, further certifications are required such as CPR training and first aid training.\n\nSome US states, such as California, have set out the responsibilities of the primary caregiver.\nOn February 27, 2004, the International Alliance of Carers Organizations (IACO) was launched by family caregiving organizations from Australia, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the U.S. The mission of the organization is threefold: \n\nIACO is headquartered in London. Initial IACO projects included promotion of a United Nations Day for Carers and a presentation on the IACO as part of a half-day workshop at the International Federation on Aging conference in Singapore on August 4, 2004. National family carer organizations in all countries are encouraged to join the alliance.\n\nCanadian Caregivers Association is a non-for-profit organization that was established to protect the rights of Canadian families and caregivers from all over Canada and warn them about malpractices in this business.\n\nEUROFAMCARE aims to provide a European review of the situation of family carers of elderly people in relation to the existence, familiarity, availability, use and acceptability of supporting services. \nIn 2003 six countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom) formed a trans-European group, systematically representing the different types of welfare-states in Europe and started a comparative study. The Pan-European Group consists of 23 countries (including the six countries, which are represented by the members of the Consortium).\n\nThe last step is a feedback research action phase based both on the study results and on the pan-European expertise. A European Carers’ Charter in progress will be further developed by the new European network organization EUROCARERS in order to stimulate further activities both on national and European policy levels.\n\nEUROCARERS was formally launched in June 2007 to provide a united voice at European level and influence policy both nationally and within the European Union. Eurocarers currently comprises representatives of 18 organisations and research bodies from nine countries. Members have come together to influence policy within the European Institutions to ensure that the invaluable contribution of carers is recognised across Europe.\n\nEUFAMI - the European Federation of Families of People with Mental Illness - has been operating since 1992.\n\nThe Carers Association was founded in 1987 to represent family carers and advocate for carers rights. The national census of 2006 shows that there are 160,917 people who stated that they are carers and almost 41,000 of these carers are providing 43 or more hours of care each week. They estimate that carers provide 194 million hours of care a year to the value of about 2.5 billion Euros to the economy. Approximately 33,000 full-time carers qualify for the Carers Allowance from the government.\n\nThe Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers (TAFC) was built in 1996. It is the first non-profit organization to voice the rights for family caregivers in Taiwan. The association encourages each city to set up a chapter in order to provide family caregivers with services. The main association is in Taipei and there are ten chapters around Taiwan. The TAFC claims that (1) The government should share the burden of family carers; (2) The government should provide well-qualified respite services; (3) The government should provide family carers with training and support; (4) Labor policy should help employees fulfill their responsibilities as family caregivers.\n\nThe TAFC provides family caregivers with a consulting hotline, newsletters of the association, in-service courses for professional personnel, support groups, and counseling services for caregivers. The association has allied with the Welfare Organization of the Elderly, Taiwan Long-term Care Professional Association, and Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease Association to build a support network for family caregivers.\n\n\nThere is no known or formal caregiver association established in the Ukraine; however, there is an Institute of Gerontology which was established in 1958, and it has four main centers or associations which include:\nThis Institute has contributed research and publications which can be very helpful in assisting the older population of the country and the caregivers of this population.\n"}

In this tradition, Muhammad compares his household (\"Ahl al-Bayt\") to Noah's ark, the only way to salvation in a sea of darkness, deviations, innovations and passions. According to Shi‘ism, the Twelve Imams are the Ulu'l-Amr, who are like the ark of Noah, and refers to them. Both Shi'a and Sunni scholars agree that prophet narrated this hadith.\n\nThe Hadith is as follows:\nBehold! The similitude of my Ahlul Bayt, is like that of the Ark of Noah: The one who embarks it, will have saved himself, and the one who turns away from it, is doomed.\n\nMany Sunni books narrate this Hadith. Some significant Sunni books that narrate this Hadith are:\n\nAl-Hakim al-Nisaburi, one of the greatest Sunni scholars, narrated this hadith as authentic (sahih) in his Mustadrak. Al-Heithami in his book (\"written against Shia\") states: By many narrations of this hadith which strengthen each other;\"\"certainly Ahl al-Bayt are like the Ark of Noah, saved Whoever boarded\"\", and in Sahih Muslim \"\"perished whoever turned away from it\"\" also comes along.\" And in his another book, Al-Heithami indicates this hadith as authentic (sahih). According to Dahlan, the authenticity of this hadith is confirmed by different sources.\n\nThe hadith implies the absolute priority of \"Ahl al-Bayt\" to all others, otherwise Muhammad would have forbidden to follow them.\n\nAccording to Shia scholars, the only path to salvation is by following the \"Ahl al-Bayt\", so they must be infallible (\"Ma'sum\"), otherwise they will mislead their followers. If they are infallible, they must be Imam definitely.\n\nAccording to this hadith, they are the criterion of distinguishing believers from non-believers.\n\nThere must be an Imam at all the times until the Day of Resurrection.\n\nThe number of Imams is twelve.\n\nBased on Tayyebi: One of the narraters of this hadith is Abu Dharr who narrates this hadith while holding on the door of Kaaba which is an emphasis on this hadith and holding on to the ahl al-Bayt. \nAbu Dharr, while introducing himself, narrates this hadith to remind people that he is Abu Dharr known as Sadiq by Muhammad.\n\nThe Prophet compares this world with its darknesses, deviations, innovations and passions to a stormy and raging sea covered with dark clouds that the only, unique way of salvation is boarding this Ark (safinah).\n\nAl-Samhudi states: The salvation is the aspect of resemblance of \"Ahl al-Bayt\" to Noah's ark by the Prophet. As a result, hadith implies that to be grateful to \"Ahl al-Bayt\" by their gratitude, appreciation and sanctity. Everyone behave in this way, he is survived from the darkness of enmity and he is grateful; otherwise he is drowned in the sea of disbelief and the punishment of hell is urgent for him.\n\n\n"}

According to oral tradition, the custom is believed to have been brought to Vrlika from Jerusalem during the 16th century. Undoubtedly a long tradition, the practice of guarding Christ's grave is embedded in the history of Vrlika and it's Orthodox Christian inhabitants. \n\nWith the conversion of many Serbian Orthodox locals into the Uniate and Catholic faith, the tradition was carried on by local Catholics, many who now self-identify as Croats. There are no significant differences in the ceremony or uniforms between the Orthodox and Catholic traditions.\n\nPrior to 1991, when the observation of Easter fell on the same day, Orthodox and Catholic Guardian's would visit each other's churches, celebrating and leaving gifts at both churches. The tradition is well known as an example of Vrlika's Orthodox and Catholic populations close relationship and tolerance towards each other.\n\nČuvari Hristovog Groba is one of Serbia's candidates for UNESCO's Intangible cultural heritage-list.\n\nThe Church of St. Nicholas was founded in 1618. It is not known when the tradition began, although folklore tells that it has existed for more than four centuries. \n\nThe guards arrive at the church dressed in folk costumes of Vrlika and nine nearby villages, led by the \"harambaša\" (chief), and two guards take place at the north and south of the tomb of the Christ. There are frequent changing of the guards' places, and they march quietly through the church unobtrusively, in solid piety, until they take their seats and stare at the Holy Shroud. The custom originates from folk piety and do not disturb the harmony of church prayers, but embellishes the liturgy with elements of warrior dignity. A guardian of the tomb can only be an honourable and devout Serbian Orthodox male from Vrlika and it's nine surrounding villages. \n\nThe Republic of Croatia sent a letter to the Association of Čuvari Hristovog Groba, requesting that the tradition be presented as a Croatian national tradition. Association President, Dragan Pavlović, said that the Republic of Croatia had already presented Sinjska alka and another Serbian folk tradition, Ojkanje singing, as Croatian traditions (in UNESCO), and that the Serbian inhabitants of the region \"will not give them Čuvari Hristovog Groba\".\n\nThe tradition, initially solely Serb, entered local Catholic liturgical practice only with the Uniate (Catholicization) of local Serbs, thus, Pavlović says that \"it is therefore Croats appropriate this Serb tradition [...] we Serbs do not want to, in this way, be Catholicizated.\"\n\n"}

The \"chitarra\" is a frame with a series of parallel wires crossing it.\n\nThe dough consists of durum wheat semolina, eggs, and salt. It is then worked and, after a rest, rolled flat with a rolling pin. The dough is then placed on the \"chitarra\" and pushed through with the rolling pin, so that the strings of the guitar cut it into strips. Pasta makers from Abruzzo bring down the cut dough by passing a finger on it, as they would \"play an arpeggio\".\n\nThe tool named \"chitarra\" was invented around 1890 in the province of Chieti. Before then, pasta was cut with a special rolling pin with notches to obtain its particular shape.\n\nIn Abruzzo, maccheroni alla chitarra are most typically prepared with a ragout of lamb (\"ragù d'agnello\").

The choice of rice flour as the source of starch is not critical, and regular white (wheat) flour may be substituted. Sohan papdi is similar except that it uses a mixture of chickpea flour and wheat flour as the starting material instead of rice flour. The threads of pismaniye, however, are considerably finer than those of sutarfeni, because the gluten in wheat flour allows the pastry strands to be thinner without falling apart . The addition of cardamom as a flavoring agent is a typically Indian touch. \n\nWithout special equipment to melt the sugar/flour mixture and spin it into threads, making sutarpheni can be laborious and the recipe is unsuitable for preparation at home. (Videos illustrating the manual preparaton show 3-4 people standing around a large pan and pulling the pastry into a circle that is repeatedly folded upon itself.) Alternative recipes start either with shredded filo pastry, which is fried in butter or shortening, or ready—made store-bought fried wheat vermicelli. The pastry is then combined with about half its weight of sugar syrup (made with 2 parts sugar and 1 part water), which is then gradually absorbed by the pastry, so that the final product is dry.\n"}

It is similar in composition to cow's milk, though higher in fat and more watery. Pig milk is seldom obtained for human uses and is not considered to be a viable agricultural product. Several attempts have been made to produce pig milk cheese, some of which have been successful.\n\nPig milk contains 8.5% fat compared to 3.5% in cow's milk. It has similar colostrum composition in terms of protein, fat, and lactose, when compared to cow's milk. Pigs with high-protein diets produce more milk compared to those on low-protein diets. It is also described as more gamy than goat's milk and seems more watery than cow's milk.\n\nPig milk is not considered suitable for human consumption or commercial production for a number of reasons. Pigs are considered difficult to milk. The sow herself is reluctant to be milked, may be uncooperative or become spooked by human presence, and lactating pigs may be quite aggressive. Sows have 8 to 16 small nipples, each giving little milk for a short duration. A cow's milking time can be around ten minutes compared to fifteen seconds for a pig. A sow may produce only 13 pounds of milk per day compared to a cow's production of 65 pounds. (Production has been estimated using a system of weighing piglets prior to and after suckling.) In addition, no existing milking machine is designed to attach to around a dozen teats and extract milk for fifteen seconds. Finally, pigs, unlike cows, cannot become pregnant while lactating, which makes a pig milk operation even less viable.\n\nPig milk is generally considered unappealing for human consumption. Compared to more conventional animals such as dairy cattle or goats, a main issue is their omnivorous diet. Also, the flavor of pig milk has been described as \"gamy\", more so than goat's milk. The milk is also considered more watery than cow's milk.\n\nCheese produced from pig milk has been described as having a concentrated and intensified flavour of pig milk. Chef Edward Lee prepared a ricotta cheese from pig milk, which he described as \"delicious\".\n\nA Dutch farmer produced one of the first experimental pig milk cheeses. As many as ten people worked to milk the sows for dozens of hours. Several of the attempts to produce cheese failed. They managed finally to make a few pounds. It was reported that it tasted \"chalky and a little bit salty\" and compared to other cheeses \"saltier and creamier, yet grainier\". The cheese was sold to an anonymous buyer at a children's charity for $2,300 per kilogram. The price fetched was higher than the most expensive variety known as pule cheese, which is made from the milk of the Serbian Balkan donkey.\n\nSusanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton used to wash her face with pig milk and then drink it. She recommended this treatment to others, as she believed it would help retain one's figure and complexion.\n\n\n"}

In calendar year 2014, the brand sold 28.4 million cases, higher than any other spirit brand in the world. Compared to the other Indian whiskies which are mainly made from molasses (therefore technically making them rums), OC is made from grain.\n\nIn 1988 Kishore Chhabria, the future founder of Allied Blenders & Distilleries (ABD), was then managing director of the Shaw Wallace, an Indian liquor manufacturer based in Kolkata owned by his elder brother, Manu Chhabria. Kishore Chhabria noticed that all attention had been given to frontline brands and some brands had been ignored by the administration of the company. To boost neglected brands, he set up a separate division of the company in Delhi and created a new whisky which he intended to have affordability with class.\n\nKishore Chhabria had a long dispute with Vijay Mallya of United Spirits over ownership of the Officer's Choice brand. In 1990s Kishore Chhabria fell out with his brother Manu Chhabria and left Shaw Wallace, taking \"Officer's Choice\" with him. Later he joined Vijay Mallya who gave Kishore equal stakes of his company, Herbertson. At that time OC became a product of Herbertson. Later Kishore also fell out with Mallya, and left Herbertson taking a single brand, \"Officer's Choice\" with him. He established his own company, Allied Blenders & Distilleries (ABD), and OC became its prime brand. However, Mallya bought Shaw Wallace after the death of Manu Chhabria. Mallya also claimed that \"Officer's Choice\" was the product of his company. Finally, this dispute was resolved out of court with Kishore paying to Mallya.\n\nOfficer's Choice historically targeted daily wage earners.

Its precise meaning has varied by location and over time.\n\nThe word \"Bannwald\" is a combination of \"Bann\" (English \"ban\") and \"Wald\" (English \"forest\" or \"wood\"). \"Bann\" has many historical meanings in German, one of which refers to an area controlled by and set aside for the use of a landowner in medieval times (comparable to the forests subject to the royal ban in Anglo-Saxon England). A \"Bannwald\" was a forest where a nobleman had the prerogative to make use of it and the creatures in it. A royal ban forest existed at Dreieich (from the heathen worship of three oaks) for a very long period, and its charter was one of the most primitive. The (obsolete) French literal equivalent (also: \"banbois\") is still the toponym of local forests in areas which once were part of the former Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn modern times, the term \"Bannwald\" is, in a certain sense, an archaic word which has been revived as a specific term for forests under various types of protection.\n\nThe term is generally used with a rather broad meaning:\n\nDepending on the respective forest act, there may be an overlapping or difference in meaning between the terms \"banned forest\" and \"protection forest\".\n\nSilvicultural use is still permitted and in the case of protection forests it is even welcome (except in Baden-Württemberg). However, it is prohibited in the core zones of nature reserves. \"Forestal exclusion zones\" (temporarily restricted forest areas) subject to hunting prohibitions or restrictions, or temporary \"hunting grounds\" or \"game preserves\" (areas closed during a hunting season or breeding and upbringing season) are not classified as banned forests.\n\nThe term \"Bann\" dates back to the Middle Ages. At that time a \"Bannwald\" referred to a forest area where the respective territorial lord had the exclusive right to use the forest (\"forest privilege\"). Originally this applied only to hunting (\"hunting privilege\") and fishing, however, later it was extended to the complete use of the forest. In the mountain valleys of Switzerland banned forests had the function to protect against avalanches and also to provide sufficient timber for fencing torrents. Corresponding decrees from the 14th century deal with protection against avalanches, rockfalls and flooding. The concept of \"Bannwald\" plays an important part in Ludwig Ganghofer's novel \"Die Martinsklause\" in which a tyrannical administrator in Berchtesgaden claims excessive privileges.\n\n→ \"see also: \"\n\nIn Baden-Württemberg, there are \"Bannwälder Totalreservate\", fully protected reserves where any use is strictly prohibited by law. In other federal states of Germany such \"total reserves\" are known under different names. Due to their structural diversity in living trees and dry wood banned forests are refugia for many endangered species of animals, plants, and mushrooms.\n\nIn Bavaria \"forest and its existence and size is extremely essential in particular in densely populated and sparsely wooded areas and consequently its size and structure must be preserved as it is of extraordinary importance for the climate, water resources or for air purification\" and may be classified as banned forest.\"\n\nIn Hesse a \"Bannwald\" is a forest which because of its location, size and extraordinary importance for hydrological balance, climate and air purification has to be preserved and may be cut only in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Austria, a \"Bannwald\" is a stricter form of a protection forest.\n\nThe Swiss Forestry Act of 1874 uses the term, Schutzwald (protection forest), rather than \"Bannwald\".\n\n\n\n"}

The treat was used by folktale-hero Momotarō (the Peach Boy) to recruit his three beastly retainers, in the commonly known version of the tale.\n\nIn modern times, this millet dumpling has been confounded with the identically-sounding confection Kibi dango named after Kibi Province (now Okayama Prefecture), even though the latter hardly uses any millet at all. The confectioners continue to market their product by association with the hero Momotarō, and more widely, Okayama residents have engaged in a concerted effort to claim the hero as native to their province. In this context, the millet dumpling's historical association with the Kibi Province has undergone close scrutiny. In particular, Kibitsu Shrine of the region has had ongoing association with serving food by the name \"kibi dango\".\n\nConventionally, kibi dango or \"kibi mochi\" uses the sticky variety proso millet known as \"mochi kibi\", rather than the regular (amylose-rich) millet used for creating sweets.\n\nUse of the term \"kibi dango\" in the sense of \"millet dumpling\" occurs at least as early as the , in an entry dated 1488 (Chōkyō 2, 3rd month, 19th day) which mentions \"kibi dango\". The Japanese-Portuguese dictionary \"Nippo Jisho\" (1603–04) also listed \"qibidango\", which it defined as \"millet dumpling\".\n\nIn earlier times, there similar foods though not designated \"kibi dango\". Writer in his 1862 essay collection observed that such foods, made out of millet meals or other ground grains undergoing a process of steaming and pounding, and recognizable as \"dango\" to his contemporaries, were once called \"bei\" (, the same character as \"mochi\") in the olden days.\n\nThe Kibitsu Shrine of the former Kibi Province has an early connection to the millet dumpling, due to the easy pun on the geographic name \"Kibi\". The pun is attested in one waka poem and one haiku dating to the early 17th century, brought to attention by poet and scholar in a treatise written in 1941.\n\nThe first example, a satirical composed at the shrine by the feudal lord Hosokawa Yūsai (d. 1610) reads \"Since \"kine\" (\"miko priestess\", but also double entendre for \"mochi-pounding mallet\") is traditional to godhood, straightaway I would fain see the pounding of Kibitsu (or \"Millet's\") shrine into dumplings.\" The \"kibi dango\" which is implicit in this poem must have required pounding in a Japanese mortar (\"usu\") in its preparation: conceivably the raw grain was pounded into meal, or the cooked millet was pounded like mochi. And it must have been something the shrine served to visitors on some occasions, one source venturing as far as to say that \"it was already being \"sold\" at Kibitsu Shrine at the time.\n\nA haiku in similar vein, of somewhat later date and also at the same shrine according to Shida, was composed by an obscure poet named of Bitchū Province. The haiku reads \"Oh, mochi-like snow, Japan's number one Kibi dango\", The flaunting of the stock phrase from the Momotarō story, constituted \"immovable\" proof of an early Momotarō connection in Shida's estimation, but it was based on the underlying convinction was that \"Japan's number one kibi dango\" was a phrase ever-present since the earliest inception of the Momotarō legend. That premise was later compromised by , who after examining Edo-period texts of Momotarō concluded that \"Japan's number one\" or even \"millet dumpling\" had not appeared in the tale until decades after this haiku.\n\nIn later years, more elaborate legends were promoted connecting the shrine, or rather its resident deity Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto to the kibi dango. The founder the Kōeido authored a travel guide in 1895, in which he claimed that Kibitsuhiko rolled with his own hand some kibi dango to give to Emperor Jimmu who stopped at Takayama Palace in Okayama, but that anecdote was purely anachronistic. Later, an amateur historian wrote a 1930 book proposing that the legend of Kibitsuhiko's ogre-slaying was the source of the \"Peach Boy\" or Momotarō folktale, leading to fervent local efforts to localize the hero Momotarō to Kibi Province (Okayama Prefecture).\n\nIn the widely familiar version of Momotarō, the hero spares his traveling rations of \"kibi dango\" to a dog, a pheasant, and a monkey and thereby gains their allegiance. However the scholar Koike compared the various kusazōshi texts and discovered that early written texts of the Momotarō legend failed to call the rations \"kibi dango\". Versions from the Genroku era (1688–1704) has , and other tales antedating \"kibi dango\" have or instead. Moreover, the \"Japan's number one\" brag was unattached to Momotarō's kibi dango until around the Genbun era (1736) as far as Koike could fathom.\n\n"}

It is a fish preserved or cured with salt, and was a staple food in Southern China. It historically earned the nickname of the \"poor man's food\", as its extreme saltiness is useful in adding variety to the simpler rice-based dinners. More recently it has become a popular cuisine in its own right.\n\nBeginning near the 15th century, China struggled with economic problems in the lower classes. Even relatively advanced cities like Guangdong had large populations without access to any kind of food preservation. More recently, this meant being without any sort of refrigeration. To overcome the rotting of room temperature meat, a number of methods became popular, such as canning and salting. The coastal Guangdong province includes fishes as a major food source, and the fishing industry was the most productive source. Thus food preservation efforts with focused foremost on fish, and the eventual convergence of these techniques gave eventual rise to the dish.\n\nThe presence of common salt, sodium chloride, helps to preserve salted fish, through inhibition of bacterial growth. When the solution of salt, or brine, is more concentrated—specifically, has a lower water potential—than the fluid of the fish tissue, osmosis will occur. Water molecules will pass from the fish tissue (higher water potential) into the brine (lower water potential) until the water molecules in these two solutions are evenly distributed. This is known as a hypertonic environment. Most bacteria cannot survive in such an environment, as their cells shrink and normal biological function cannot continue, eventually terminating in lysis. This lends the antiseptic properties, and hence preservational power, of salt.\n\nA wide range of fish species can be prepared as Cantonese salted fish. The most common ones are Eleutheronema tetradactylum (mayau (馬友)) and Ilisha elongata (鰽白). Other types of fish, such as Pseudosciaena crocea (黃花魚) and Bahaba taipingensis (白花魚) can also be used.\n\nIn addition to the different types of fish, Cantonese salted fish can be divided into two main types: méi-xiāng () and shí-ròu (). For méi-xiāng (fragrant) salted fish, fish with thicker bodies such as Scomberomorus (jiaoyu (鮫魚))and mayau are preferred. It takes 7–8 days for méi-xiāng salted fish to ferment, after which it is seasoned with salt and dried in the sun. Méi-xiāng style salt fish has an intense salty fragrant flavour which makes it unsuitable to be eaten unaccompanied. Méi-xiāng salt fish , either when raw or after steaming, is usually shredded or cut into small pieces and used as a topping or seasoning. \n\nShí-ròu (實肉) (firm fleshed) salted fish does not need to be fermented, it is prepared by seasoning followed by direct sun and wind drying. Fish with thinner bodies such as Ilisha elongata are usually used to prepare shí-ròu. Unlike méi-xiāng salted fish, shí-ròu can be eaten directly unaccompanied after frying or steaming.\n\nIn Tai O, a vertical marination method (插鹽) is the most popular way to prepare Cantonese salted fish. In this method, fish such as Ilisha elongata and mayau will first be gutted and then washed. The cleaned fish are inserted head down vertically into a heap of salt. Under gravity, the juice of the fish can flow out from the mouth of the salted fish. Through this method, the salted fish can be kept as dry as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Cantonese slang dead bodies are referred to as salted fish, and a number of other phrases derive from this usage. A slang term for something that is saved or revived when it seems that it is dying or has little chance of surviving is \"haam yu faan saang\" () literally, \"a salted fish coming back to life\". It is also used to describe a person or an organisation making a comeback after an event that would normally be career ending. “食得鹹魚，抵得渴” is slang which means that \"those who eat salted fish must put up with the thirst\"; this is a popular slang to tell people that they have to bear the consequences of their actions.\n\nA famous song named ‘Without the Two of Us’ by Hong Kong popular singer George Lam, has a line related to salted fish. The line is ‘And even salt fish and pak choi will taste really really good’. As salted fish is the symbolic dish of the poor, this line make the allusion that with love even a simple and humble life is enough.\n\nThe Hong Kong comedy movie, Shaolin Soccer references salted fish in the line, \"If we don’t have any dreams in life, we will look like a salted fish\". This line became popular in Hong Kong, and has been mistaken for a traditional Chinese saying, it has even been cited in public examinations.\n\nIn scientific research, salted fish has been considered possible risk factor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In 1967, Ho presented evidence that the Tankas (boat people), who consume Cantonese salted fish in their daily diet, had twice the incidence of NPC compared with the land-dwelling Cantonese in Hong Kong. Since salted fish is traditionally eaten with rice, part of a staple diet for children and the poor segment of Southern China, these are the populations that are at highest risk of NPC. Further research has since shown that, broadly, the residents of Southern China are more at risk than other countries, supporting the theory that the food has a link to NPC.\nIarc Classifies salted fish as Carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)\n"}

In the past,before industrialisation of China in the 1950s begun, many Chinese from the Pearl River Delta region needed to go to Southeast Asia for work. They would fry the dace, preserve it with salted black beans and bring it with them because they were not used to eating foreign food. This tradition gradually transformed into a canned food business. The first canned fried dace with salted black beans was produced by Guangzhou Guangmaoxiang Canned Food Factory in China in 1893. This factory was evolved from “广奇香罐头厂” (the Guang Qi Xiang Guan Tou Factory), which was registered in 1912 in Hong Kong.

Furthermore, the middle income group would also use it during emergencies (e.g. when strong typhoon signals are in force or during tropical rainstorm which prevent people from going out to eat). Nowadays, the price range of fried dace with salted black beans is approximately from HK$14 to HK$21 (by observing one of the biggest supermarkets in Hong Kong), which is relatively affordable. Thus, fried dace with salted black beans has been a common dish among lower and middle class before and is still considered as one occasionally. Even though people can afford to buy more nutritious food instead of menial canned foods after the economic boom in 1970s, people from different financial background will also consume this kind of canned food due to its convenience and cheap prices.\n\nAround the 1960s, people in Hong Kong did not have a good living environment and family circumstances. They had low income and low purchasing power. Due to its low price, its strong taste, which allows it to be served with rice alone, and its long shelf life, canned fried dace with salted black beans became a very common food for meals. Sometimes, it would be cooked at home, which added warmth and nostalgic value to this dish. Fried dace with salted black beans was the collective memory for many people in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, people consumed less inferior food like fried dace with salted black beans nowadays. There are some reasons behind this. Firstly, after the economic takeoff in 1970s, the economic ability and social status of people in Hong Kong had improved. The rise in income and purchasing power had exposed them to more choice of food. Secondly, people in Hong Kong started to have higher education level. They would then take nutritional values of food into consideration when deciding what to eat. As many researches show that canned food lacks nutritional value because of the artificial processing, people consume less fried dace with salted black beans. Moreover, they would store a few cans at home for rainy days. On the other hand, fried dace with salted black beans became widely commercialized. It is mass-produced by different food companies and sold as a product on the shelf in supermarkets. It is now usually purchased in cans instead of being cooked at home because of efficiency and convenience.\n"}

It is distilled four times from pomegranates, dates, grapes, figs, olives, wheat, and barley. AVIV is made by a family of vodka artisans whose ancestors moved from the Russian Empire to the Kabbalistic town of Tzfat in 1824. The water in AVIV is harvested from natural aquifers underneath Israel and from Lake Tiberius, also known as the Sea of Galilee. AVIV's formulation of grain and fruit alcohol produces a complex taste profile which is slightly sweeter than typical grain vodkas. The AVIV brand is positioned as an Israeli vodka that is ultra-smooth with a slightly sweet finish. The AVIV brand is also positioned as a vodka from the Holy Land with hidden, positive, spiritual messaging delivered by its glass bottle composition; bottle design, cap and bottle decoration. AVIV's promotion tagline is \"We Believe in the Power of Good Thoughts™”\n\nThe idea for AVIV 613 was conceived in 2004 by Founder & CEO Marc Grossfield when he went to Israel and met with Yossi Gold, AVIV's master distiller.

AVIV 613 Vodka was officially launched in Minnesota on November 27, 2013. It took Yossi Gold 3 years to develop the recipe and formulation process.\n\nAviv uses the seven ingredients from the Bible and that have spiritual significance. The grain alcohol and fruit alcohol is distilled and filtered separately Three times each, then blended and distilled One time (a total of four distillations), then filtered six times. The numbers \"613\" in its brand name refer to this 316 process (Hebrew reads right to left) in its physical definition. The numbers have a spiritual reference as well: The 613 laws of the Torah which are the same five books (First Testament) of the Christian Bible.

The brand name (often shortened to Sam Adams) was chosen in honor of Founding Father Samuel Adams. Adams inherited his father's brewery on King Street (modern day State Street). Some histories say he was a brewer, while others describe him as a maltster. The Samuel Adams brewery is located in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, where visitors can take a tour, and shop beers and merchandise. Samuel Adams beer is brewed by the Boston Beer Company, which was founded by Jim Koch and Rhonda Kallman. Samuel Adams beer was started using a recipe now known as the Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\n\nFollowing Jim Koch’s great-great grandfather’s recipe, Samuel Adams continued to use traditional brewing processes, including decoction mash (a four vessel process) and krausening (a secondary fermentation). Boston Lager is also dry hopped using the Hallertau Mittelfrueh and Tettnang Tettnanger hops.\n\nIn addition to year-round offerings, Samuel Adams also has offerings for each season. The winter seasonal beer is Cold Snap, a Witbier. The spring seasonal beer is the Escape Route, a Kölsch. The spring seasonals are sold from January to March. The Summer offerings are available from April through August, and include Summer Ale, a wheat ale; and Porch Rocker, a radler. The Autumn seasonal beers are available August through October and include Octoberfest, a Marzen; and Pumpkin Batch, a saison. The Winter/Holiday seasonal beers are available November through December and include Winter Lager, a bock; and White Christmas, a spiced ale. Samuel Adams also offers seasonal variety packs which include a mix of year-round and seasonal offerings.\n\nFirst brewed in 2014, Samuel Adams Rebel IPA is a West Coast style India Pale Ale. The beer is brewed with five American hops - American Cascade, Simcoe, Chinook, Centennial, and Amarillo. In early 2015, Samuel Adams released Rebel Rouser, a double India Pale Ale, and Rebel Rider, a session India Pale Ale. There are five flavor options in the Rebel Family; Rebel Juiced IPA, Rebel Grapefruit IPA, Rebel Rouser IPA, Rebel Cascade IPA, and Rebel Raw IPA.\n\nIntroduced in 2001 Sam Adams Light was the second light beer the company brewed. The company previously sold Boston Lightship which was introduced in 1993.\n\nThese Belgian style beers are left in large wood barrels to age and pick up some of the flavors of the wood. The beers in this collection include American Kriek, New World, Stony Brook Red, Thirteenth Hour and Tetravis.\n\nThere are currently nine brews of this variant available: Fresh as Helles, Ella Blanc IPL, Noble Pils, Winter Lager, White Christmas, Octoberfest, Cold Snap, Summer Ale, and Porch Rocker.\n\nOriginally brewed in a nano brewery in 2014, the Nitro Project is a collection of two styles that are infused with nitrogen gas in the carbonation process. The two brews are Nitro Coffee Stout and Nitro White Ale. There was also a third style, Nitro IPA, which is not currently brewed. In a Boston Globe article, Jim Koch describes the process of infusing the nitrogen as \"difficult\".\n\nReleased in 2018. Sam ‘76 is brewed using both Lager and Ale hops to make a beer like no other. It’s comes in at 4.7%. It has a tropical taste and aroma and has a refreshing feel.\n\nIn 2002 the company released \"Utopias\"; at 24% abv, it was marketed as the strongest commercial beer in the world (a mark that has since been challenged). The company subsequently released new \"vintages\" of \"Utopias\" annually, increasing the alcoholic content to 27% abv by 2007.\n\n\"Utopias\" is made with caramel, Vienna, Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts, and four varieties of noble hops: Hallertauer Mittelfrüh, Tettnanger, Spalter, and Saaz hops. The beer is matured in scotch, cognac and port barrels for the better part of a year. A limited number of bottles are released each year; in 2007, only 12,000 bottles were produced, and in 2009, only 9,000 bottles were released. Sold in a ceramic bottle resembling a copper-finished brewing kettle, a single bottle of \"Utopias\" cost $100 in 2002, and $150 in 2009.\n\nBecause of legal restrictions, \"Utopias\" is not offered in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, or West Virginia.\n\nStarting in the 2018 season, Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams became the official beer of the Boston Red Sox replacing Budweiser. The eight-year deal will last through the 2025 season and include signage and a Sam roof deck. The agreement also allows Boston Beer to use the Red Sox Logo for marketing purposes, run Red Sox related contests with tickets to games.\n\nThe Boston Brewery opened in 1989 and it is where every beer was first made, aside from the Boston Lager. There are two other breweries in Cincinnati, Ohio and Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. Only the Boston Brewery is open for public tours and tastings. The Boston Brewery tour is free, and only guests 21 years of age and older are allowed to sample on the tour. \n\nSamuel Adams beer has gained attention in the media for its various beers. In a list of \"Best Christmas/Winter Beer in Each State\", Samuel Adams' Fezziwig brew won in the state of Massachusetts. Additionally, Samuel Adams brewery itself was named the best brewery in all of Massachusetts according to a Yelp-based Buzzed article.\n\n"}

It is a popular street food in Taiwan which has led to the popular misconception that the gua bao is Taiwanese in origin.\n\nIt consists of a slice of stewed meat and other condiments sandwiched between flat steamed bread known as lotus leaf bread (he ye bing). The lotus leaf bun is typically in size, semi-circular and flat in form, with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance that it has been sliced. The traditional filling for gua bao is a slice of red-cooked porkbelly, typically dressed with stir-fried suan cai (pickled mustard greens), coriander, and ground peanuts. \n\nThe lotus leaf buns are a traditional Chinese accompaniment to rich dishes such as\nbowl-steamed pork in rice meal or roast duck and thus the buns support a wide array of fillings with gua bao being just one style which utilises pork belly. A lotus leaf bun by itself is called a \"he ye bing\" but with filings is called a \"he ye bao\". They are found all across China, being particularly common in North China.\n\nIn Taiwan, gua bao were introduced to the island by Fuzhounese immigrants where the flavors were modified to suit local tastes which favoured Southern Fujianese flavours over Eastern Fujianese ones. In Taiwan they are sometimes referred to as Chinese hamburgers although Westerners generally refer to Roujiamo as \"Chinese hamburgers\". The food is known colloquially in parts of Taiwan as \"hó͘-kā-ti\" () in Taiwanese Hokkien due to the mouth-like form of the bun and the contents of the filling.\n\nIn Hong Kong, they are known as cha bao (叉包) which means \"fork buns\" as the sandwiches are usually pierced by a toothpick or wooden skewer to keep the fillings in place. \n\nIn Japan they are called kakuni manju (角煮饅頭) and are sold as a Chinese snack food. They are a specialty of Nagasaki Chinatown, having been sold in Japan for centuries due to the large number of Fuzhounese immigrants and historic relations between Fuzhou and Nagasaki represented by the construction of Sofukuji Temple. Recognizing the Fuzhounese community and historical connection, Nagasaki and Fuzhou established ties as sister cities in 1980. Another iconic Nagasaki dish of Fujianese origin is champon.\n\nGua bao became popular in the West through chef David Chang's Momofuku restaurants although he says that he was unaware that the gua bao dish already existed because his Momofuku recipe was inspired by his dining experiences in Beijing and Manhattan Chinatown's Oriental Garden where the Peking duck was served in lotus leaf buns rather than the traditional spring pancake and he called them pork belly buns. The name \"gua bao\" was used and popularised by chef Eddie Huang when he opened his BaoHaus restaurant.\n\nIn the United States, New York City has a significant population of Fuzhounese Americans and gua bao is a popular dish sold at restaurants along with other iconic Fuzhounese dishes such as Fuzhou fish balls and lychee pork.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, they are often called hirata buns, named after Masashi Hirata, the executive chef of Ippudo in New York as many ramen restaurants began to adopt the practise of selling gua bao alongside their ramen dishes due to the influence of Momofuku and to meet high demand from customers whom mistakenly believed they were a staple of ramen restaurants. \n\nThere have been many new trendy \"gua bao\" which incorporate pan-Asian fusion or non-Chinese stuffings between the lotus leaf buns, such as kimchi or karaage. Although these are technically not gua bao at all as they do not include pork belly, and in China would only be considered different lotus leaf bun sandwiches (he ye bao).\n\n"}

{"id": "44457824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44457824", "title": "Cuisine of Corsica", "text": "Cuisine of Corsica\n\nThe cuisine of Corsica is the traditional cuisine of the island of Corsica. It is mainly based on the products of the island, and due to historical and geographical reasons, has much in common with Italian cuisine, and marginally with those of Nice and Provence.\n\nThe geographic conformation of Corsica, with its eastern coast (the one nearest to the continent) low, malaria-ridden, and impossible to defend, forced the population to settle in the mountains of the interior. The agricultural products exported during antiquity reflect this situation: these were sheep, plus honey, wax and tar, produced by the widespread forests. Moreover, the island was famous for its cheap wines, exported to Rome. The concentration of settlement in the interior, typical also of the nearby Sardinia, lasted until the beginning of the 20th century; in 1911, 73,000 people lived in the zone comprised between 700 and 1,000 m above sea level.\nIn the Middle Ages, and more precisely during the 12th century, when Pisa was Corsica's hegemonic power, the large immigration from nearby Tuscany brought to the island, together with the Tuscan language, customs, and dishes typical of that Italian region. Later, when it was the turn of Genoa to dominate the island, a major shift in people's eating habits took place; the Genoese governor, with a decree signed on 28 August 1548, ordered that each landowner and tenant had to plant at least a chestnut, a mulberry, an olive, and a fig tree each year, under the fine of three \"lire\" for each tree not planted. The reason for this decree was to give means of subsistence to island populations. Still at the beginning of the 17th century, the Genoese administrator Baliano wrote that the Corsicans were living on barley bread, vegetables, and pure water.\nOther decrees were given on the same line, such as that issued in 1619, which ordered that 10 chestnut trees had to be planted every year by each landowner and tenant, with time changed radically the landscape of whole regions of the island, with the almost total substitution of cereals with chestnuts; one region, the Castagniccia, south of Bastia, got its name from its chestnut (\"castagnu\") forests. In the 18th century, the chestnut had almost completely replaced cereals. Above all, chestnut plantations radically changed the diet of the islanders, preserving them from the recurrent famines. It was so that the historian of Corsica Jakob Von Wittelieb could write that in the 1730s travelers in the island brought with them a flask filled with wine and a pocket containing a chestnut bread or some roasted chestnuts.\n\nAn old Corsican proverb from upper Niolo asserts: \"Pane di legnu e vinu di petra\" (), explaining well the central place occupied by the chestnut in Corsica's alimentation (and the frugality of Corsican mountaineers, obliged to drink water instead of wine). \n\nDuring the Corsican independence before the French annexation, Pasquale Paoli tried to enrich the diet of his countrymen encouraging the cultivation of the potato, so his political opponents ridiculed him, calling him \"Il Generale delle patate\".\nThe French annexation in 1768 brought at first a change in this situation; in an effort to subjugate the rebels, the French army proceeded to cut down many chestnut forests, and this policy continued also during the first years of peace, since Paris favoured cereals over chestnut as staple food. After a while, though, the cutting down of chestnut trees ended, so that until the beginning of 20th century, chestnut in the form of pancakes, bread, or porridge remained the staple food of the larger part of Corsican population.\nNext to chestnuts, at the end of 700, the basis of Corsican diet was given from cereals (mainly wheat and rye), dried vegetables, and charcuterie.\nAnyway, there were also exceptions: from a testimony of 1775, during that year the owners of Cap Corse vineyards used the revenue from the sale of their wine to buy Italian pasta, goat and pork meat, and cod, and with those foodstuffs they ate all year round. The poor of the same region instead worked in the vineyards in the spring till the harvest, but in winter, they fed on wild herb soups. A few during summer went to reap the corn in the malaria plain of Aleria, but often after that they lost their health or life. Generally at the end of the 18th century eating was therefore eminently plant-based: the mayor of Stazzona, in Castagniccia, answering a questionnaire on the way of life drawn by the French authorities (\"the questionnaire of the year X\") mentions as basis of the diet of the village chestnut, of which he lists 12 different ways to treat it. He also writes that from November to June, only chestnut bread was consumed, and that the villagers owned vegetable gardens devoted exclusively to their feeding. The monotony of this diet was broken eating trout and eels.\n\nAfter the beginning of the 20th century, the autarchic village economy based mainly upon chestnut and other locally produced aliments as pork faded away because of several factors; above all, the eradication of malaria after the Second World War allowed life along the east coast and accelerated the depopulation of the interior. In 1990, only 20,000 people lived still in the zone between 700 and 1000 m above sea level. These changes brought also an abandonment of the production of traditional food; while in 1796, 35,442 hectares were occupied by chestnuts woods, in 1977, chestnut forests still covered 25,000 hectares, but only 3,067 hectares were cultivated; the rest were left to the animals. This situation could be only partially reverted due to the demand of local food coming from the many tourists visiting the island and to the establishment of higher quality standards in food production, also due to the AOC and AOP origin designations.\n\nLarge-scale cultivation of the chestnut tree was introduced in Corsica during the Genoese domination. Rich in calories, the fruits were plucked (without gloves) and dried, and placed on a wooden grating () above a fire () for one month: this fire, placed on a dry clay base 1 m wide and 20 cm thick, smokes also the charcuterie and heats the house. After that, they are ground to produce chestnut flour, which gets an unmistakable smoke flavour from this process. The unplucked chestnuts are eaten by the pigs foraging in the forest. These are additionally fed with chestnut flour, so that their meat acquires a characteristic taste. Used to prepare polenta () and cakes, this flour was the basic staple food for the Corsican. The importance of chestnut in Corsican life can be argued from the fact that during a traditional wedding lunch taking place in 19th century Castagniccia, not less than 22 different courses were prepared using chestnuts as main ingredient.\nToday chestnut flour is a French AOC and a European AOP, under the name \"\"Farine de châtaigne corse-Farina castagnina corsa\"\". \n\nAt the end of 20th century, 85% (1,200 t) of the chestnuts plucked in Corsica were transformed in flour, a unique case among all the French departments. The 300 t of flour so obtained were consumed almost totally in Corsica, a small part was exported to mainland France and bought by the Corsicans of diaspora.\n\nChestnut and its products are the centrepiece of two yearly fairs in Corsica: \"A Fiera di a Castagna\" in Bocognano, which takes place at the beginning of December and the \"Fête du Marron\" occurring at Évisa at the end of November.\n\nCorsican traditional cheeses are exclusively made with sheep or goat milk. In the mid 1980s, in the island raised 150,000 sheep and 20,000 goats. The most important among them is Brocciu, a whey cheese akin to ricotta (but without lactose), produced for the most part with sheep milk, sometimes with goat milk. It can be consumed either fresh or aged, and is an ingredient of innumerable Corsican dishes, from first courses up to cakes. Brocciu is the only Corsican cheese to have received the AOC denomination so far. Other notable cheeses are the \"niulincu\" (from Niolo, the hearth of Corsica), the \"balaninu\" (from Balagne, the north-west region), the \"bastilicacciu\" and \"sartinesu\" (respectively from Bastelica and Sartène, in southern Corsica), the \"cuscionu\" of the Zicavo valley, also in the south. The \"casgiu merzu\" (\"rotten cheese\") is a cheese containing insect larvae similar to the Sardinian \"casu marzu\". Corsican cheese producers meet each year in early May at the cheese fair (\"A Fiera di U Casgiu\") in Venaco.\n\nCorsican charcuterie is considered one of the best worldwide due to the traditional production processes, and to the fact that Corsican pigs (), which live partly in the wild, are crossbred with wild boar () and are mainly fed with chestnuts and chestnut flour. Each peasant family has one or two pigs; these are castrated (sterilised if female) when they are two months old. When they are slaughtered, they are about 14 months old and weigh 200 kg. This usually happens in December, before Christmas. The carcass is hung upside-down to let the blood drain, and is totally processed. The same day as the slaughtering, dishes are prepared such as figatelli, boudin, and \"ventra\" (similar to the Italian \"sanguinaccio\"). The intensive breeding takes place in the mountains, where the animals cannot disturb the cultures. Above all in the Castagniccia, Bastelica, upper Taravo, and Quenza regions, a pigherd (\"u purcaghju\") watches the pigs, which are free to search in the woods for chestnuts, roots, and small animals, but in the evening, they are fed with kitchen scraps and spoilt apples.\nTypical cold cuts are \"prisuttu\" (ham); \"panzetta\" (bacon); \"lonzu\", one of the four pork's fillets, peppered, salted and smoked; \"figatellu\" (a sausage made with pork liver), and \"capicollu\" (also called \"coppa\"). \"Figatellu\" is smoked above the \"fucone\" three or four days, then put to dry: it can be consumed roasted or grilled. \n\"Prisuttu\", \"coppa\" and \"lonzu\" acquired in 2012 the AOC denomination.\n\nFollowing the tradition of mainland France, in Corsica are prepared several pâtés (\"pastizzi\") from pork liver (\"pastizzu di fecatu di maiale\"), thrush (\"pastizzu di torduli\"), hare (\"pastizzu di levru\"), common blackbird (\"pastizzu di meruli\", now prohibited), wild boar (\"pastizzu di singhjari\").\n\nCorsican olive oil is mainly produced in the hills of Balagne, the northwest region of the island, where a quarter of all olive trees on the island exist. Another important region for oil is the Alta Rocca, around Bonifacio: here in the village of Santa Lucia di Tallano, each year is celebrated the \"Festa di l'olio novu\", a yearly fair devoted to the production of the new oil. As a whole, the olive groves cover in Corsica 2,000 hectares, divided among 300 producers. The olives, which are mostly black, are not plucked manually; they fall on nets lying under old trees, while those on young trees are plucked mechanically. The harvest occurs when they are ripe, between November and May. Since 2004, the Corsican oil is an AOC product, under the name \"Huile d'Olive de Corse-Oliu di Corsica\", and successively it got also the AOP European denomination.\n\nOlive trees in Corsica are under threat from Xylella fastidiosa, a disease spread by tiny sap-sucking insects known as leafhoppers, which in April 2018 was reported to have spread from Italy.\n\nWine was introduced into Corsica by the Greeks. The Romans developed the wine industry, and imported Corsican wines. The island's wines were highly regarded during the Renaissance: in the Gallery of Maps in the Vatican, which depicts the regions of Italy and its surrounding islands, the 16th century Italian cosmographer Ignazio Danti wrote above the map of Corsica: \"Corsica has received four major gifts from Nature: its horses, its dogs, its proud and courageous men and its wines, most generous, that princes hold in the highest esteem!\" In 1887 the vineyards of the island were hit by the Phylloxera. A dramatic change in the island's viticulture happened at the beginning of the 1960s. At that time about 20,000 pied-noirs (French colonists from Algeria) had to leave north Africa and resettled in Corsica. The French state helped them with huge capitals, that were used among others to plant large vineyards on the east coast (which had been cleared from malaria few years before), introducing southern varieties which changed the profile of Corsican wines. The vineyard area, that amounted to 4,700 hectares in 1959, rose to 28,000 hectares in 1978. wine production rose accordingly from 284,000 hectoliters in 1966 to 2 millions hectoliters in 1978. This expansion had as result a massive overproduction, which was fought by the state by uprooting a great part of the vines. This measure brought the surface in 1993 back to 7,609 hectares, 1,994 being of AOC wine, and the production to 410,581 hectoliters, 76,512 being of AOC wine.\n\nIn 1972, the French Ministry of Agriculture established the denomination \"Vin de Corse\", the AOC denomination for Corsican wines. Moreover, each production area can have an additional local AOC denomination. These are as of 2014 eight: Porto Vecchio, Figari, Sartène, Ajaccio, Calvi, Patrimonio, Cap Corse (the latter with the Muscat du Cap Corse, a sweet dessert wine). AOC wines must obey to several prescriptions: sugar cannot be added; at least 50% of the grapes must come from traditional Corsican grapes; the yield cannot be higher than 50 hectoliters each hectare; the grapes must be planted only along slopes or dry plateaus. The most important wine regions in the island are: the territory around Patrimonio, at the south west of the Cap Corse peninsula; the Ajaccio region; the Sartène region; the Balagne, and the Cap Corse.\nBesides the AOC, local wines are also produced in Corsica, under the denomination \"Vin du pays\".\n\nA Corsican specialty is the chestnut beer (\"biera accumudata cu a castagna\"), brewed since 1996 by the Pietra Brewery. Pietra beer is a 6% ABV amber beer, brewed from a mix of malt and chestnut flour. The annual production in 2006 amounted to over 25,000 hectolitres, exported also to mainland France.\n\nThe most important Corsican liqueurs are \"aquavita\", a local grappa, and Myrtle (\"licor di mortula\"), a liqueur which is also produced in Sardinia, and is obtained, both at home or industrially, through the maceration in alcohol of the berries (and sometimes the leaves) of myrtle, a flowering plant belonging to maquis (\"machja\") and common in both islands. A famous apéritif is the \"Cap Corse Mattei\". Very popular are also Ratafia, liqueurs obtained macerating fruits into local \"aquavita\" and sugar.\n\nSoups (\"minestre\") are an important part of the Corsican cuisine. The \"minestra\", or \"zuppa corsa\", akin to the Italian minestrone, is a soup with beans, potatoes, garlic, onion, mangold, cabbage and tomatoes, whose grease is given by an ham bone and shortening. Among other traditional soups are the bread soup (\"minestra di pane cotto\"), similar to the Italian pancotto; the soup with fresh brocciu (\"minestra di casgiu frescu\", from Carpineto); with aged brocciu (\"minestra di brocciu seccu\"); with red beans and leek (\"minestra di fasgiolu e di porri\", from Niolo). On Maundy Thursday, meat is replaced with chickpeas by the \"minestra incu i ceci di Iovi Santu\". In the island is also prepared the \"Stufatu\", a soup whose main ingredient is either wheat flour (\"stufatu di farin'di granu\") or corn flour (\"stufatu di farin'di granonu\"). \"Brilluli\" is a porridge whose ingredients are chestnut flour, water and goat milk.\n\nPasta dishes particularly show the Italian influence on the Corsican cuisine. Especially stuffed pasta is popular, like \"ravioli\" and \"cannelloni\": both are stuffed with \"brocciu\", similar to the Italian ricotta, ravioli together with spinachs. Pasta sauce with tomatoes and minced meat (\"Salsa pe a pastasciutta\") is also typical. Other preparations reflect the Italian tradition too: \"sturzaprezi\" (literally \"priest chokers\") are large gnocchi baked in an oven made with brocciu and spinach, akin to the Italian dumpling version of this dish; \"Panizzi\" are fritters prepared with gram flour similar to the Sicilian \"panelle\". Lasagne and gnocchi with meat sauce (\"lasagne incu a salsa\" and \"Gnocchi manera bastiaccia\", \"Gnocchi at the mode of Bastia\"), are also popular. Although corn polenta is known, in Corsica \"Pulenta\" for antonomasia is that prepared with chestnut flour, \"pulenta castagnina\". Another dish whose main ingredient is chestnut flour is \"Maccaredda\", fritters fried together with \"panzetta\" (bacon). \"Razighe\", from Rusio, are thin dough pancakes made of wheat flour, yeast, egg and cracklings (a byproduct of \"sdruttu\" processing). \"Migliacci\" are savory galettes made of wheat flour, yeast, whey, goat and sheep cheese, baked on chestnut leaves.\n\nMeat in Corsica often comes from locally bred animals, and is very tasty, due to the numerous herbs of the maquis (\"machja\") which feed them. Very popular is lamb (\"agnellu\") and kid (\"caprettu\"), the latter consumed especially at Easter. They can be eaten roasted, as ragout (\"tianu\") or stew (\"in cazzarola\") \"Stufatu\" is a stew made with beef meat, ham, garlic, onion, clove and herbs. Game is also abundant: wild boar (\"singhjari\"), thrush (\"tordulu\"), hare (\"levru\"), common blackbird (\"merulu\", now protected), snipes (\"bicazzi\") have their own recipes. Several dishes are prepared when the pig is slaughtered: \"Sanghi di maiale incu l'uva secca\", a blood sausage with raisin, akin to the Italian \"Sanguinaccio\" and the French boudin; \"Ventra\", another preparation made with pork blood, pork stomach and mangold; \"Casgiu di Porcu\" (\"Pork cheese\"), resulting from boiling several hours pork head and feet, cooking the detached meat and fat with spices and letting it harden in a recipient; \"Misgiscia\", similar to Albanian and Tibetan dishes, is a filet of goat, cut in thin slices which are macerated in vinegar, spiced with herbs, and skewered on a green tree branch. Dried to the sun, they are consumed grilled or cooked as ragout. Another typical preparation during pork slaughtering is clarified pork fat (\"u sdruttu\") used as fat instead of olive oil. Porto Vecchio is home to three dishes prepared with innards: \"Corda\", goat or sheep intestines boiled in water and cooked in a pan with onion and garlic; \"Rivia\", lamb or kid intestine, innards, cooked on a skewer, put into the animal`s net, and pickled, similar to the Sardinian \"Cordula\"; \"Manghjaria\", ram, sheep or goat tripe, in the past offered to the people participating to a funeral.\n\nIn the sea around Corsica are fished about forty species of fish. Fish are also abundant in the inland rivers and creeks. Typical is the fish soup, either with sea fish (\"azziminu di Capicorsu\") or with river fish (\"azziminu di Corte\"). A legacy of the Genoese (and of the centuries-old contacts with Tuscany and Rome) are the dishes based on baccala and on stockfish: the former can be deep fried (\"fritelle di baccalà\"), or–a recipe from the Genoese colony of Bonifacio–with mangold and raisin (\"baccalà incu e cee e l'uva secca\"), while the latter is prepared with tomatoes, anchovies and walnuts, in a dish named \"u pestu\". The national cheese, \"brocciu\", is used also with fish, in dishes as sardines stuffed with brocciu (\"sardine piene incu u brocciu\") or anchovy-brocciu cake (\"torta d'anchjuve e di brocciu\"). The large lagoons along the east coast (like the \"Étang of Biguglia\" and \"of Diana\") produce eels, which are cooked roasted (\"anguilla arustita\") or as stew (\"tianu d'anguila\"). The creeks of the mountains gives trouts in abundance: these are consumed stuffed with brocciu (\"truite piene incu u brocciu\"), or simply roasted over a hot creek stone (\"truite annant'a petre fiuminalinche\").\n\nCorsican cuisine, akin to other Mediterranean cuisines, shows several stuffed vegetables (\"ripieni\"), the stuffing ingredient being always brocciu: artichokes (\"l'artichjocchi pieni\") and zucchini (\"e zucchine piene incu u brocciu\"), aubergines (from Porto Vecchio and Sartène) (\"i mirizani pieni\"), onions (\"e civolle piene incu u brocciu\"). Vegetarian ragouts are also popular, like that with fava beans (\"u tianu di fave fresche\") or with red beans and leeks (\"u tianu di fasgioli e porri\"). \"Sciacci\" are shortpastry fritters filled with potatoes (\"sciacci di pommi\") and grated cheese.\n\nChestnut flour and brocciu appear as ingredients by many Corsican cakes. \"Falculelle\" from Corte are small cakes made wıth brocciu, sugar, flour and egg yolk, and cooked in oven over a chestnut leaf. \"Cacavellu\", from Vico, is a round cake prepared with a wheat, yeast, eggs and \"sdruttu\" dough, garnished with brocciu mixed with sugar, orange zest and eggs. \"Fiadone\", prepared also in a similar form in some regions of southern Italy, is a cheesecake made with brocciu, eggs, sugar and citron zest. \"Imbrucciate\" are little \"fiadoni\" which have puff pastry as bottom layer. \"Canistrelli\", akin to the Italian Canestrelli, are biscuits made with flour, butter, sugar, and flavoured with white wine or anisette, while \"cucciole\", originating from Balagne, are biscuits made of flour, oil, sugar and white wine. \"Castagnacciu\", a simple Italian cake consisting only of chestnut flour, raisins and walnuts, is prepared also in Corsica. Also with chestnut flour are prepared \"nicci\", galettes cooked in the fireplace between two iron plates (\"i ferri\"), very popular also in central Italy. \"Frappe\" are fried dough rhombs flavored with lemon zest, similar to the Italian \"castagnole\".\n\nSeveral cakes are prepared for feasts and special occasions, and some are characteristic of one town or village: \"Strenna\" (a pie made with flour and \"sdruttu\" dough and a brocciu filling) is prepared in Vico for New Year's Day, \"panzarotti\" (beignets made with flour, rice and yeast) are prepared in Bastia for St. Joseph's day (19 March), \"panette\" for All Saints' Day (1 November), \"pan di i morti\" (also named \"uga siccati\", small breads made with flour, yeast, sugar, butter, eggs, raisins and walnuts) for All Souls' Day (2 November) in Bonifacio, \"canestri\" (donuts made with flour, butter, eggs and sugar) and \"campanili\" (donuts made with flour, yeast, egg, shortening, raisins soaked in \"aquavita\" and sugar, decorated with boiled eggs) at Easter, \"sciacci\" (the sweet version of these fritters, stuffed with brocciu, and traditionally cooked on a hot granite stone named \"teghja\") are prepared in Sartène at Easter and during sheep shearing, in May. \"Inuliata\", prepared in Ajaccio during the holy week, is a yeast cake having flour, powdered sugar, olive oil and wine as ingredients. \"Fritelli\", eaten at Maundy Thursday in Calenzana, are wheat or chestnut flour fritters.\n\nCorsicans produce at home also many fruit preserves (\"confiture\"), having as main ingredients the island's fruits: chestnut (\"confitura di castagne\"), fig (\"confitura di fichi\"), red tomatoes (\"confitura di pummata rossi\"), strawberry tree (\"confitura d`arbitru\"). A specialty is the citron confit (\"confit d'alimea\"), which uses as main ingredient the fruits grown in the Cap Corse region.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44493430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44493430", "title": "Khao chae", "text": "Khao chae\n\nKhao chae (, ) is \"rice soaked in cool water\". \"Khao\" means \"rice\" and \"chae\" means \"to soak\". Around the time of King Rama II, the recipe was adapted from a Mon dish and then modified. It was meant to be made and consumed in the hot season, from mid-March to the end of April. Ice was not then available in Thailand, so the water was kept cool during hot season by putting it in an earthenware vessel in a shaded place.s Some old recipes call for the use of camphor to cool the dish.\n\nThe Mon people prepare this dish during the Songkran Festival as part of their thanksgiving. When khao chae was introduced to Thailand during the reign of King Rama II, it was considered \"royal cuisine\" and not available to the public. According to Thai celebrity Chef McDang, who grew up in a Bangkok palace, it's \"the only Thai dish that can truly be considered 'royal Thai cuisine'.\"\n\nSome of the most famous neighborhoods in Khao chae of Bangkok include Banglampoo and Dinso road near the Democracy Monument, both are in Phra Nakhon. \n\nKhao chae is not easy to prepare. Ordinary jasmine rice is too soft, so the firmer \"khao taa haeng\" variety is used. It is first cooked in the normal way and then put in a colander and rinsed under running water several times to remove excess starch.\n\nNext, a special ingredient: flower-scented water. A large pot is half-filled with water and a handful or two of fresh jasmine blossoms added. Then a small flower-scented candle is floated on top of the water, lit, and the pot covered loosely with the lid for 15 minutes. More blossoms and a candle with a different scent are then added and left for another 15 minutes—and then done for a third time. The scent from the candles and the natural oils from the jasmine should permeate the water.\n\nSprinkle the already cooked rice liberally with scented water, wrap it into a piece of cheesecloth, twisting the ends together to make a tight bundle to stop the rice from swelling. Tie a knot in the top. Steam over boiling water. To serve, transfer some of the rice into a bowl, cover with more of the fragrant water and add a few small ice cubes and some of the flowers.\n\nThe side dishes eaten with khao chae are the real stars of the meal. Recipes vary but the essentials remain the same.\n\nAt a well-known Bangkok restaurant, the following side dishes are served when khao chae is ordered:\n\n\nDon't heap your bowl full of rice. Add just a third, followed by just enough jasmine water to cover the rice. Only add enough ice to cool things down. \nDon't put the side dishes into your bowl of rice. Have a little bite of your side dish, chew a bit, then follow with a spoonful of the icy rice. Nibble on fresh vegetables between each side to refresh your palate. It is suggested that you start with the condiment that has the mildest taste and work your way through to the one with the strongest taste.\n\n"}

It is made from baked milk by lactic acid fermentation.\n\nRussian and Soviet sources call it \"Ukrainian ryazhenka\" or \"Ukrainian soured milk\" (, ) and attribute its origin to Ukrainian cuisine. The name is cognate with the Ukrainian as in (, \"baked milk\").\n\nSimilar traditional products made by fermenting baked milk have been known in Russia as . While some dictionaries define both names as synonyms, the industry standard GOST distinguishes between the two products, specifying somewhat different production processes.\n\nSimilar products are also and in Turkic countries. Before fermentation, milk should be heated to a high temperature. This is the main difference of , and from other yoghurt drinks.\n\nRyazhenka is made by pasteurising milk and then simmering it on low heat for eight hours or longer. Historically, this was done by placing a clay pot (\"glechik\" or \"krinka\") with milk in the traditional Russian oven for a day until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes the Maillard reaction between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting in the formation of melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. In household production, sour cream (smetana) is subsequently added to trigger fermentation. In modern industrial production, pure thermophile bacterial cultures (\"Streptococcus thermophilus\" and \"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus\") are used instead. The mixture is then kept in a warm place. The fermentation occurs at temperatures above ca. 40 °C / 100 °F and usually takes from three to six hours.\n\nThe fat content of industrially produced ryazhenka is typically 3.5−4%, but in general it is allowed to vary from <0.5% (if made from skimmed milk) up to 8.9%. The protein content is at least 3%. The carbohydrate content is usually 4−5%. Like scalded milk, ryazhenka is free of harmful bacteria and enzymes and can be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours.\n\n"}

It is traditionally made with chicken or pork and fresh herbs such as galangal, sweet basil, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, cooked in a small clay pot on a charcoal stove. It is often served with \"nam chim\".\n\nThe name is derived from the words for dipping and dropping, the customary way of eating the dish.\n\nLiterally the word \"chim chum\" derived from two Thai words: \"chim\" and \"chum\". \"Chim\" means to dip in, while \"chum\" means to drop something down quickly or briefly in or into liquid. The name \"chim chum\" comes from the way we cook and eat this popular hot pot. \"Chim chum\" is an earthenware pot on a brazier at table top. The pot is filled with broth and to this you add various supplied vegetables and herbs. The herbs are often pulled from trees the selection criteria being as broad as bitterness to health aspects. Some dishes place a flower in the pot which is a unique bitterness. Thai Northeastern people call this dish \"chaeo hon\" (แจ่วฮ้อน)\n\nYou are served with a clay pot filled with broth. When the broth is boiling, then you first add the vegetables. This will lower the temperature in the pot a little and you should wait until it boils again before putting a piece of meat in the pot using your chopstick, and cook the meat for just less than one minute or until it’s cooked, then enjoy the meat by dipping it into the sauce (\"nam chim\").\n\nMarinate the pork with oyster sauce, light soy sauce and sugar.

According to Macveigh (2008) the Punjab tandoor originated in the local region. It is a clay oven and is traditionally used to cook Punjabi cuisine. It is traditional to have tandoors in courtyards of homes in the Punjab region to make roti, naan and tandoori chicken. In rural Punjab, it is also traditional to have communal tandoors. \n\nPunjabi tandoori cooking includes:\n\nAccording to Davidson (2014), \"the villages of Punjab had open-air tandoors where housewives would bring their dough to be rolled into rotis by the tandooriya\". Steiner (2005) states that some villages in Punjab have communal tandoors.\n\nA Lachha paratha is baked in the tandoor and is round in shape with multiple layers.\n\nAccording to O'Brien (2013), \"the Amritsari kulcha is a crisp, flaky roti made with refined flour; it is stuffed with potato, onionblack pepper, chilli, cumin, and dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) and cooked in the tandoor\". \n\nDishes similar to tandoori chicken may have exited during the Harappan civilization. According to archaeologist and vice-chancellor of Deccan College Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BCE. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors so popular in the Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. However tandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of India and Pakistan. In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in Peshawar by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Thakur Dass, and Kundan Lal Gujral, who are all Punjabi as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant.\n\nAccording to the New Larousse Gastronomique (2018) culniary reference book, \"the Punjabi naan is a white-flour, yeasted flat bread enriched with a little ghee – its tear-shape comes from being slapped on the side of a tandoor oven and baked partly hanging vertically\".\n\n\nPunjabi tandoori cooking is cooked in a tandoor (Gurmukhī:ਤੰਦੂਰ; Shahmukhi:تندور). The tandoor in Punjab is also known as tanoor.\n\nAccording to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Hayter (1992) the original versions of the tandoor \"in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground\". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground. Planalp (1971) notes that \"the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi\" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor.\n\nAccording to Kenihan and Kenihan (1990)\"the tandoor method of cooking ... was indigenous to the north west frontier province, now Pakistan, and the Punjab\". According to Kehal (2009), the use of the Punjabi tandoor is associated with Punjabi cooking in undivided Punjab.\nPunjabis have traditionally used the tandoor on a regional level to cook meat dishes and breads. The use of the tandoor is so entrenched in Punjabi culture that it forms a part of Punjabi folk songs. According to Kalra and Gupta (1986), the tandoor in the Punjab \"is a social institution. In the villages of the Punjab, the communal tandoor, dug in the ground, is a meeting place.\" \n\nThe use of the tandoor became popular in other regions of India, after the 1947 partition with the arrival of Punjabi refugees. Punjabis leaving West Punjab resettled in areas such as Delhi. The cuisine of Delhi was \"affected by the Punjabi influx after Partition. The clay oven (tandoor) and numerous Punjabi specialities were introduced\". According to Ghosh (2016) (reciting Pant (2013)), \"the rest of the country was introduced to the magic of the tandoor\".\n\nThe Punjabi tandoor is to be distinguished from the Punjabi bhathi, an oven, which can be made out of bricks or mud and clay and is fired from an opening on one side. Punjabi bhathis are closed at the top with a metal cover and the smoke is emitted through a cylinder.\n\n"}

The secret recipe has been passed from generation to generation in the Vena family. In 1900, Amaro Lucano gained fame throughout the Kingdom of Italy, after the Vena family became the official supplier to the House of Savoy, whose coat of arms appears on the label.\n\nAfter a period of recession during the World War II, in 1950 the workshop became an industrial enterprise under the management of Vena's sons Leonardo and Giuseppe and in 1965 a new factory in the frazione Pisticci Scalo was opened.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Vena family also began producing other alcohol-based drinks under the name \"Lucano\" such as the Sambuca, Limoncello and Caffè varieties, as well as liqueur-filled chocolates.\n\nThe process of preparing Amaro Lucano is divided in seven steps: the selection, the infusion, the processing, the secret, the control, the mixture, and the bottling.\n\nThe herbs needed for the mixture come from different areas of the world. They are dried naturally, crushed and mixed together. Among the herbs used, there are:.\n\nThe mixture is steeped in solutions of pure alcohol and water; it then goes through hot infusion process in thermo-controlled baths (55°/60°C) overnight.\n\nThe mixture undergoes hot pressing to obtain an infusion.\n\nOnce the infusion is ready, the family secret ingredient is added to obtain the extract. \n\nLaboratory tests are run; the extract is aged for a period of five months. During the aging process there is stratification, which means that heavy components are on the bottom, while lighter components are on the top. The “heart” of the extract is the one kept.\n\nPure alcohol, essential oils, water, the aged extract, sugar, caramel and water are mixed in a large tank to get a hydro-alcoholic solution. \n\nThe mixture is then filtered, bottled and ready to be sold.\n\nAmaro Lucano is caramel brown in color, has a bittersweet flavor, and its strength is 28% ABV.

The symbol of the cartwheel is found on many souvenirs and various naming Düsseldorf again. This tradition was honoured in 1954 by the erection of a fountain, called Cartwheeler's Fountain, in Düsseldorf's \"Burgplatz\".\nThe origin of the custom cannot be pinned down to a single historic event, but several stories have appeared around it.\n\nThe best known version is the battle of Worringen. Adolf VIII, Count of Berg, defeated the Archbishop of Cologne in this battle in 1288. As a result of the victory, Düsseldorf received city rights. According to the story, the custom stems from the population and especially the children running for joy and making cartwheels on the streets .\n\nAnother narrative style is about a wedding procession, in which the wedding carriage's wheel broke. To ward off the impending disaster, a boy jumped into a coach, and held the wheel. Whether the wedding was that of Jan Wellem and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici or to the wedding of the Margravine Jakobea of Baden with Johann Wilhelm of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, is controversial. A further modification takes on these second wedding. The bride is supposed to have been very unhappy with her marriage, but the cartwheelers and their coach's skills would have made her laugh.\n\nLate 19th century and early 20th century, many travelers came to the city for major exhibitions -the forerunners of today's fairs. The children discovered that cartwheels was a lucrative source of income, as the incoming bourgeois paid them up to a penny for what they thought was a \"local and patriotic\" symbol.\n\nIn 1945, after the war-evacuated Jan-Wellem monument was brought back to the city, not only torches and fanfare accompanied it, but also cartwheeling boys.\n\nCartwheelers are found in several fountains in the city. The best known is Radschlägerbrunnen (Cartwheeler Fountain) in the Burgplatz, created in 1954 by Alfred Zschorsch, with Hans Müller-Schlösser's inscription \"\"Radschläger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Minschen och drieve\"\" (\"We want to keep being cartwheelers, no matter how crazy the world might be\"). Even street maintenance hole covers and door knockers of Saint Lambertus Church, designed by Friedrich Becker, who also created the cartwheelers in front of the Düsseldorf's shopping mall Schadow-Arkaden.\n\nThe tradition is notably kept alive by the Alde Düsseldorf civil society of 1920, who conducted the first cartwheeler competition on 17 October 1937. Since 1971, it was held annually by boys and girls in June on the Königsallee, and since 2006 on the Rheinwerft below the old town and has become an integral part in the Düsseldorf event program. More than 500 boys and girls participate each year.\n\nIn 2001, the project \"Radschläger-Kunst\" (Cartwheeler-Art) started, consisting in the creation of over 100 cartwheeler sculptures by professional and amateur artists. The sculptures, which used Saint Lambertus Church door knockers as a starting model, are two meters high and wide and have a depth of 30 centimeters. They were distributed in the urban area and only a part was purchased at the end of the year from private individuals or companies.\n"}

A group of activists claimed that it \"is a poor attempt at 'pinkwashing' the Conservative government's obvious desire to encourage war with Iran.\"\n\nAccording to Omar G. Encarnación, a Professor of Political Studies at Bard College, the Obama administration was accused by some critics of pinkwashing \"to distract from other unsavory policies such as the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants and the failure to prosecute those responsible for the human rights abuses of the Bush administration’s War on Terror.\"\n\nSarah Schulman, a writer and professor at the City University of New York, claims Israeli government public relations campaign exploits the idea of Israel being LGBT-friendly to promote public perception of Israel as a \"modern democracy\", a \"safe and secured place for investment\", and a \"tourist destination with the sun and the sand\". In August 2011, \"The Jerusalem Post\" reported the Foreign Ministry was promoting Gay Israel as part of its campaigns to counter the negative stereotypes that many liberal Americans and Europeans have of Israel. Critics of Israel like Jasbir Puar, an associate professor of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers University, cite the Israeli government's comparison of LGBT+ rights in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories as an example of pinkwashing. Citing WorldPride, which Jerusalem hosted in 2006, she wrote: \"Within global gay and lesbian organising circuits, to be gay friendly is to be modern, cosmopolitan, developed, first-world, global north, and, most significantly, democratic.\" Joseph Massad, associate professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, has written that the Israeli government \"insist[s] on advertising and exaggerating its recent record on LGBT rights ... to fend off international condemnation of its violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nOthers assert that pinkwashing allegations against Israel constitute a straw man argument, arguing that Israel's embrace of the LGBT community has never been used to justify or excuse the Israeli occupation of Palestine, stating bluntly that the fact that Israel is generally tolerant towards LGBT individuals and groups on both state and individual levels is a factual contrast to the discriminatory and often-brutal treatment given to LGBT people by Arab and Muslim groups. Ido Aharoni, former head of the Brand Israel project, responded to such criticism saying: \"We are not trying to hide the conflict but broaden the conversation. We want to create a sense of relevance with other communities.\" Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor and a frequent defender of Israel, has said that the term \"pinkwashing\" is used against Israel by \"some radical gay activists\" who are antisemitic \"bigots.\" He called the use of the term \"pinkwashing\" in this context as \"nothing more than anti-Semitism with a pink face.\"\n\nYair Qedar, a gay Israeli filmmaker and civil rights activist, has said that Israel has a praiseworthy LGBT+ rights record and that failing to defend it \"ultimately serves homophobia far more than dialogue and peace\". He criticized Israeli LGBT+ groups for failing to oppose pinkwashing charges. Shaul Ganon of the Israeli based LGBT+ rights group Aguda, assessed the dispute this way: \"Each side is trying to gain some points. The truth is the only one who gets screwed by this is the Palestinian gays.\"\n\nA campaign to develop public support for the Keystone Pipeline, which would transport Canadian oil through the United States, has been accused of pinkwashing for its argument that the project deserves support based on a comparison of Canada's record on LGBT rights compared to that of other oil-producing nations. The campaign base at OpecHatesgays.com headlines its presentation: \"Compare Canadian Ethical Oil to OPEC conflict oil\".\n\nIn 2014, BP launched \"LGBT Careers Event\", a move that was met with criticism as an attempt to pinkwash the conduct that led to Deepwater Horizon oil spill, described as \"the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced\".\n\nIn Australia, concern has been raised about the commodification of gay rights by major corporations.\n\nA coalition organized by several popular grassroots movements in Europe, including the English Defence League (EDL), mounted demonstrations in conjunction with LGBT Pride Week celebrations in Helsinki and Stockholm in July and August 2012. In an interview for Radio Sweden, the Swedish author and activist Lisa Bjurwald claimed that the EDL have exploited pride events in the United Kingdom by bringing attention to Islamic homophobia and that Queers against Pinkwashing (a group that protested against the Stockholm march) is opposed to talking about homophobia in Islam and label all such attempts as \"pinkwashing\" and a \"divide and conquer tactic.\"\n\nIn June 2016, Organisation Intersex International Australia pointed to contradictory statements by Australian governments, suggesting that the dignity and rights of LGBT and intersex people are recognized while, at the same time, harmful practices on intersex children continue.\n\nIn August 2016, Zwischengeschlecht described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning \"intersex genital mutilations\" as a form of pinkwashing. The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.\n\nStephan Lefebvre of the Center for Economic and Policy Research has noted how the Obama administration, followed by the mainstream US media, has criticized Russia for its failure to provide basic civil liberties for its LGBT population. He contrasts that with the US government's failure to condemn the comparable record on LGBT issues on the part of US allies like Honduras, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as the US government's failure to acknowledge progress on LGBT rights in Cuba. In his analysis, this constitutes pinkwashing, which he defines as \"deliberately highlighting support for gay rights while ignoring or downplaying other relevant human rights issues\". Laurie Penny, an author and feminist activist, contrasted those who criticized Russia's LGBT policies during the Sochi Olympics with their silence on instances of homophobic treatment at their own countries' border crossings. She wrote:\n\n\n"}

Rakhri means “to protect” whereby a brother promises to look out for his sister and in return, a sister prays for the well being of her brother.

In 2007 Bellamy's Organic was purchased by Tasmanian Pure Foods, a privately owned business set up to invest in and build Tasmanian food and agribusinesses. In June 2014 Tasmanian Pure Foods was renamed Bellamy's Australia.\n\nFollowing a highly successful July 2014 IPO, Bellamy's Australia Limited (BAL) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 5 August 2014. Heavy trading and a more than 30% rise in initial share price saw the launch of the company deemed an 'outstanding success' by financial industry commentators.\n\nRodd Peters, founding partner of Peters Linnette Lawyers and consultant with Australian law firm Kemp Strang, was elected to the board of Bellamy’s on 28 February 2017 and was appointed as interim Chairman of the Board on 1 March 2017. In April 2017, John Ho, founder and chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based investor Janchor Partners, joined Bellamy’s board as a non-executive Director, before being appointed as Chairman in May 2017.\n\nIn April 2017, Bellamy's confirmed acting CEO Andrew Cohen as its permanent chief executive. In June 2016, Cohen, formerly of Bain & Company, was appointed to the role of Chief Operations & Strategic Officer, before being appointed acting CEO in January 2017. The appointment of financial advisor and Acting CFO Nigel Underwood was also finalised in April 2017. Underwood, formerly CFO of transport operator Keolis Downer, was appointed to the role of Acting CFO on in January 2017 and subsequently made permanent in that role in April 2017.\n\nIn August 2017, the Group announced revenue for the year to June 2017 of $240.2 million (2016: $234.1 million) and normalised profit after tax of $28.2 million. On 9 August, Bellamy's shares gained 32 cents, or 4.1%, to reach $8.20, reaching their highest level since early December 2016.\n\nBellamy's is a Tasmanian-based company that produces 100% Australian made, certified organic foods. Bellamy's supplies its product range to supermarket chains, pharmacy chains and independent stores across Australia, and sells direct to consumers via an online sales portal. Bellamy's also exports its products to customers in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and New Zealand. As a result of the high demand for Bellamy's products in Asia, the company opened an office in Shanghai in 2012 and in Singapore in 2014.\n\n\nIn July 2014, Bellamy's Australia sold 25 million new shares and 10.9 million existing shares to raise nearly $36 million, in what was described by the Australian Financial Review as \"one of the best-performing initial public offers of the year\".\nListing on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 5 August 2014, Bellamy's Australia Limited (BAL) shares were \"quickly embraced by investors\", surging in value as much as 34% in the first day of trading. Described by stock analysts as an \"outstanding success\", prices rose to a high of $1.34, before closing 30.1% above the $1 offer price at $1.31, giving the company a market capitalisation of $124 million. The issue price has valued the company at 19-times forward earnings for Financial Year 2015, with an indicative dividend of 1.6%. Share prices remained strong in the following week's trading with a mid-week high of $1.47 settling to $1.39 at closing on Friday 15 August.\n\nThe company's product range includes infant formula, follow-on formula, toddler milk, baby rice, baby porridge, apple and cinnamon breakfast, teething rusks, brown rice pasta, baby macaroni and spelt pasta, grain and fruit snacks, ready to serve baby meals, and vegetable macaroni. Products are developed for three specific age groups, targeting newborns (0–6 months), infants (6–12 months) and toddlers (1–3 years). In 2014 this range was expanded to include organic milk drinks for children in the 3+ years age group; positioned as a supplementary food for children, created to complement the dietary needs of toddlers and children who may require additional energy and nutrients.\n\nBellamy's produces Australia's only certified organic infant formula product and is positioned as a \"premium\" brand within that domestic market. In 2013, the baby food and formula category in Australia experienced 9% current value growth largely due to baby formula, which experienced a 12% value increase. Bellamy's had approximately 3% share of the overall baby category in 2014, with approximately 10% of the baby formula market share and 12% of the baby cereals and snacks market share. As at 2014, Bellamy's has an estimated 95 per cent share of the organic segment of that market.\nIt is estimated that 15% of the company's revenue for the 2014 financial year came from offshore. The company is a major exporter of organic infant formula to the (estimated 2014) $1 billion per annum Chinese organic infant formula market and is positioned as a \"super premium\" brand within that market. Increased focus on the development of the greater Asian market has seen the company establish subsidiary businesses in Shanghai and Singapore to handle marketing and distribution of Bellamy's products in China and South East Asia. The company's sales of organic infant formula are forecast to increase by 151% in the 2015 financial year, with organic food sales forecast to rise by 178% for the same period. Bellamy's has also flagged plans to expand into the currently $650 million US and $225 million UK organic baby food markets in 2016.\n\nNew e-commerce regulations in China in 2016 led to an oversupply of Australian-labelled baby formula, causing widespread retail price discounting and heavily impacting company earnings in the second half of 2015-16 and first half of 2016-17. The appointment in June 2016 of retail pricing specialist and Bain & Company partner Andrew Cohen as Chief Operations & Strategic Officer, saw revenue for the six months to 31 December rise 12.5 per cent to $118.3 million compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe company's expansion into the Chinese market and associated rapid growth have garnered significant attention within both media and academic circles, both in Australia and internationally.\n\nThe company's rapid and continued growth has been the subject of a section in influential marketing textbook 'Principles of Marketing' in which the success of the business has been attributed to Bellamy's \"sophisticated market research and their ability to launch new products at the right time with a genuine offering\" by contributing author Lewis.\n\nIn 2013, high-profile CEO and Managing Director Laura McBain was named as the Telstra Tasmanian Business Woman of the Year, and went on to be named Telstra Business Woman of the Year (Private and Corporate).\n\nIn August 2014, the company was announced as the 'Best Regional Mid-Market Business' in the 2014 BRW/GE Capital Mid-Market Awards.\n"}

It is known for its shape and flavor. First appearing in Chaoyang District in Shantou, Hao Kuih is generally not well known beyond the Chaoshan community.\n\nGods worship has a long history in Chanshan area. Unlike other superstitious activities, Chanshan natives more express their wishes for a better life. They make Kuih by themselves for pleasing their gods in their worship traditions. Usually Chaoshan women will use rice flour, sweet potato flour and other materials to make snacks. In Chaoshan, this kind of snack is generally called Kuih(粿）. Sometimes it is similar to cakes in other places. There are many traditional activities of gods worship, in which Kuih plays an important part.\nSome researchers regard this way of worshiping gods as bribery. Natives use food to please their gods and hope gods can bless them. In Chaonan District in Shantou, many counties hold splendid festivals for gods, among which one is the most important for villagers. That is the day of showing their respect for all gods, and it is usually chosen in winter by the local. On that day, people will prepare a feast for all the gods and express their thanks to gods for all their bliss. A lot of food is prepared and after the ceremony people will distribute those tributes to their friends and relatives. A feast for gods finally ends up with a feast with friends and relatives.\n\nEven though the ingredients are almost similar, there are many kinds of Kuih with different shapes and colors: \n\n\nIt was recorded by Duan Gonglu in Tang Dynasty that people at that time started eating limulus eggs. “子如麻子，堪为酱，即鲎子酱也.” Another scholar proved it in another historical book with the description that “腹中有子如绿豆，南人取之，碎其肉脚，和以为酱”， which means that people used limulus's olive-colored eggs to make sauce. Both of them gave evidence that limulus sauce has been for a long history.\n\nHao( Teochew dialect pronunciation) is limulus. Limulus is an ancient animal which has existed for a history and is called the “living fossil”. Therefore, the preservation of limulus is to protect species diversity. So far, Limulus in Chaoshan area has been under the protection since it was listed as the second category in endangered species.\n\nIn old days, Chaoshan people caught limulus and cooked them to make sauce, which is like caviar in western countries. Limulus sauce also has special medical function for digestion. However, limulus is also poisonous. After knowing its fatal poison and its decreasing number, people begin to stop killing limulus.\n\nHao Kuih is originally made of limulus sauce and rice floor and with the filling of meat and vegetables. Since people stop killing limulus, they use some sea food like shrimp to replace it. So the Hao Kuih we eat today is different from the original one. But they pass down the traditional methods. The Hao Kuih also keep the shape of limulus only without the limulus sauce. People use barbecue sauce to improve its flavor.The Barbecue sauce in Chaoshan area is called Shacha sauce(沙茶酱). As a primary Chinese condiment, Shacha sauce is usually used in Fujian, Teochew and Taiwanese cuisine. It is made from many ingredients, including soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilies, brill fish, dried shrimps. So it has a savory and slightly spicy taste.\n\nTraditionally, people use local potato flour, rice and limulus sauce to make Hao Kuih. \n\n"}

It is also known as \"Dancing out Christmas\" (\"Dansa ut julen\") or \"Throw out the Tree\" (\"Kasta ut granen\").\n\nTraditionally since the 17th century, Christmas ends on the 20th day after Christmas in Sweden. The feast held in connection to this was originally in celebration of the Danish duke Canute Lavard. During the Middle Ages the celebration shifted to the martyred King Canute IV of Denmark, patron saint of Denmark and \"Knutsgillen\" (\"Knut's guilds\"), a form of Medieval trading companies. The guilds sometimes organized balls and the Swedish word for the gatherings, \"gille\", may have influenced the tradition of the feasting since it also means \"party\".\n\nIt is mentioned in the \"Old Farmer's Almanac\" that \"King Knut asked them for help to drive out Christmas\". In the old Swedish agrarian society, children would run from farm to farm to \"call out Christmas\" (\"ropa ut julen\"), that is call out that Christmas had ended and beg for food and drink.\n\nThe present day tradition has changed very little since the 1870s. During the 20th century, the Knut's party became mainly associated with children and candy. The observance of the feast peaked during 1950–70.\n\nIn private homes, there is often a party mainly for children. The Christmas decorations are then put aside. Such parties are also common in schools, kindergartens, churches and other places. In many towns, the illumination of the public Christmas tree is switched off, accompanied by an outdoor Knut's dance for the community. In some areas the feast is known as \"Julgransskakning\" (\"Shaking the Christmas tree\").\n\nParty activities involve singing and dancing around the Christmas tree, \"looting\" the tree of ornamental candy and apples, smashing the gingerbread house into pieces and eating it, opening Christmas crackers that have been used as decorations in the tree, lotteries, creating a \"\" (\"fishing pond\") where children will \"fish\" for toys and candy or a treasure hunt. The songs and dances are essentially the same as those performed at Christmas and Midsummer, and some songs with verses about the end of Christmas, such as \"Raska fötter springa tripp, tripp, tripp\", may especially emphasize such verses.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Christmas trees were literally thrown out of the window or from the balcony, onto the street once they had been \"plundered\" and stripped of all ornaments. Since the beginning of the 21st century, areas for dumping the trees are designated by local authorities but in 2015, spontaneous and illegal dumping grounds were still a problem. Volunteers from sport clubs and other organizations such as Lions Clubs International also help collect the discarded trees. These can be recycled for heating or used in bonfires at Walpurgis Night (\"Valborgsmässoafton\") later in spring. Failure to dispose of the tree in a manner designated by the authorities can result in a fine or a sentence of up to one year in prison.\n\nSince the late 1980s, artificial Christmas trees have replaced a portion of the natural trees and thus eliminated the need to dispose of the tree. These are simply disassembled and put into storage after the Knut's party.\n\nA number of trees are disposed around Twelfth Night, almost a week before St. Knut's Day.\n\n"}

However, by international standards, the Emperador Light expression is considered a \"cut brandy\" rather than a true brandy, as it contains neutral spirits alcohol made from sugar cane. Since this is the biggest selling variant of the brand, the brand would not be considered the best selling brandy in the world under the ordinary definition of \"brandy\".\n\nThe brand's market was initially limited to the Philippines, but has since expanded to Thailand, China, the United States, and other countries.\n\nThe advertisement approach of Emperador brandy emphasize success in life and traditional moral values such as hard work, ambition, listening to parents' advice, and professionalism.

While it was on sale there, it sold out within three days. In 2012, Top Totty was again placed on sale in the Stranger's Bar. Two days later, the Labour Party's Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities, Kate Green became aware that the beer was for sale in the House and requested that it be removed from the Stranger's Bar due to the use of a pump clip depicting a bunny girl in a bikini, which she found disturbing.\n\nThe beer was removed from the Stranger's Bar and the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir George Young stated that \"action would be taken\", which led to Top Totty being banned from the House of Commons. A petition was submitted to the British government in February 2012 calling for the beer to be reinstated but was rejected as not covering an area for which the government or parliament was responsible.\n\nUnited Kingdom Independence Party Member of the European Parliament, Mike Natrass opposed the ban, saying that \"knee-jerk puritanism does more to damage the cause of equality than a thousand beer labels.\" Top Totty was replaced in the Stranger's Bar by another beer called Kangaroo Court. Slater's Ales did offer to change the pump clip used when the beer was offered for sale in Parliament but did not intend to change it when offered for sale elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe ban in parliament caused widespread publicity and an increase in sales. Slater's Ales started to sell the beer all year round instead of just in the summer, and orders were received from abroad. A public relations company connected with Slater's claimed that the press coverage was good publicity for the beer.

After processing, the caviar may be cream-coloured, pinkish-white, or white, with the eggs generally 3–4 mm in diameter. Some snail eggs may measure at 3–6 mm in diameter. Some commercial snail farms that produce escargot include the production of snail caviar as a part of their operations.\n\nThe raw snail eggs have a slick shell that is delicate and breakable. They are sometimes pasteurised to preserve them. However, the pasteurisation of snail eggs has been described as having a tarnishing effect upon their flavour. Some preserved versions are processed and jarred without the use of pasteurisation, using brine as a preservative. Some producers use a flavoured brine to add flavour to the product.\n\nThe flavour of snail caviar has been described as being reminiscent of \"baked asparagus\", or \"baked mushroom\" with a \"subtle\" flavour with \"woody notes\", as having a \"strong earthy\" flavour, and as being crunchier than fish egg caviar. It may be served as other caviars are, with toast points, sour cream and champagne. It may also be served in soups.\n\nSnail farming is referred to as heliciculture, and includes the process of farming or raising land snails specifically for human consumption. Some commercial snail farms collect and process snail caviar, which is then jarred and marketed to consumers. Sometimes the snails are raised and kept in temperature, lighting and climate controlled conditions to encourage maximal reproduction, which produces the eggs. Since snails are hermaphroditic (having both male and female sexual organs), all can produce eggs. Snails typically bury their eggs in soil after they are laid. One method of harvesting the eggs involves placing the snails in boxes that have soil and sand in them, whereupon the eggs are gathered. Snail egg output is meagre when compared to fish roe production such as that from sturgeon. As a comparison, one snail typically lays approximately four grams of eggs annually, whereas one sturgeon may have up to of eggs.\n\nIn August 1987 in the United States, the Brut d'Escargot brand of snail caviar was reported as having a retail market value of . At that time, the retail price was similar to that of Beluga caviar. In December 2007, a 50-gram jar of De Jaeger brand snail caviar, produced at a snail farm in Soissons, France, retailed for €80. In September 2014, a 50-gram jar of Viennese Snails brand snail caviar, produced at a farm near Vienna, Austria, retailed for more than €150. A 50-gram jar equates to approximately two tablespoons of product. Some snail farms sell snail caviar directly to restaurants.\n\n"}

Tiep or \"Ceebu jën\" means \"rice fish\" in Wolof (Senegalese national language). Historically, the tiep is commonly attributed to the city of Saint-Louis, in the nineteenth century. It consists of fish, usually White grouper (Epinephelus aeneus), mixed with vegetables and rice. It can be adapted according to the means and products available. It is also the symbol of the Senegalese Terranga (hospitality): Family, visiting friends, and/or guests gather around a single dish (called a bolus) in which everyone is using a spoon (couddou Pulaar) or a piece of bread.\n\nIt is a preparation of fresh or dried fish, and rice (rice Wolof), cooked with vegetables (such as cassava, pumpkin, cabbage, carrot, turnip, or eggplant), parsley, tomato paste, peppers, garlic and onions. Originally made with fish, it is nowadays frequent to see it served with beef or even chicken.\n\nOriginally from Senegal, the traditional recipe includes fish, rice, tomato and onions. However, tiep is commonly consumed in several countries in West Africa. Depending on the country, the recipe and the ingredients change—even the method of cooking can differ. In Mali, tiep is known as \"tieb,\" a dish consisting of chicken, rice and vegetables such as a tomato and onion base. Another type of tiep is the Jollof or \"Djolof\" (in Wolof, the national language) rice also called \"Benachin\" which means 'one pot' in Wolof. It is a popular dish especially in Nigeria and Ghana. The components are similar to the original recipe's ingredients with the inclusion of tomatoes, rice and onions.\nSenegal's distinctive ethnic groups have their own variations on cuisine and eating habits, influenced either by proximity to the ocean or the traditions of nomadism and cattle raising. For instance, people from southern Senegal usually also add some kouthia, while people from Dakar and Saint-Louis will use some \"soul\" (Wolof).\n\nThe Senegalese \"Teranga\", or hospitality, is an important aspect of the Senegalese tradition of sharing food and cooking for your hosts, and it is very rude for a guest to refuse food, or refuse to share a meal. All are welcome to eat, even in the poorest household. It is a given that food is a blessing from God, and is here to be shared. There is always \"a share for the stranger\".\n\nPeople take enormous pride in their welcoming tradition and go to great length in order to fulfill what is seen as a responsibility toward their guests, or even an unannounced visitor. There’s a belief that eating around the bowl means there’s always enough food for everyone rather than eating on individual plates. Eating from the bowl teaches children values. One of them is that once they have food in your mouth they have to wait for the next portion until everyone else is ready before putting their hand back in the bowl. This teaches you to be patient.\nWhen they reach into the bowl with their hand, they have to eat from the section right in front of them. They cannot reach over to the other side. They can’t eat from the middle of the bowl. That’s where all the meat and vegetables are kept. That section is for the mother. As they eat, she regularly distributes what’s at the center of the bowl to everyone eating from it, so that each person receives an equal portion. Therefore, sharing is another value learned from the bowl. \nEmbracing teranga for the Senegalese equates to your success in life. They are taught early on to be hospitable, to be generous, to be sharing, to be grateful, to embrace others. This equates to the cooking.\nThe Senegalese generally eat three meals a day. The main meal is at about 1:00 PM. Senegalese eat from a communal platter or large bowl with the right hand, as is the Muslim custom.\n\nTiep consumption is understandable from the farming point of view but also from its benefits. Eating plenty of fish on a regular basis can help protect you from a range of serious diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. Eating a diet rich in vegetables may reduce risk for stroke, cancer, heart diseases and type-2 diabetes.The nutrients in vegetables are vital for health and maintenance of your body.The health benefits of rice include its ability to provide fast and instant energy, regulate and improve bowel movements, stabilize blood sugar levels, and slow down the aging process, while also providing an essential source of vitamin B1 to the human body. Other benefits include its ability to boost skin health, increase the metabolism, aid in digestion, reduce high blood pressure, help weight loss efforts, improve the immune system and provide protection against dysentery, cancer, and heart disease.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45290075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45290075", "title": "Punya (Hinduism)", "text": "Punya (Hinduism)\n\nPunya (Sanskrit: पुण्य) is a difficult word to translate; there is no equivalent English word to convey its exact intended meaning. It is generally taken to mean 'saintly', virtue, 'holy', 'sacred', 'pure', 'good', 'meritorious', 'virtuous', 'righteous', 'just', 'auspicious', 'lucky', 'favourable', 'agreeable', 'pleasing', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'sweet', 'fragrant', 'solemn' or 'festive', according to the context it is used. \n\n\"Punya\" (पुण्य,) is referred to as good \"karma\" or a virtue that contributes benefits in this and the next birth and can be acquired by appropriate means and also accumulated. In Vedanta terms \"punya\" is the invisible wealth, a part of \"dharma\", the first of four human goals; the other three goals being \"artha,\" \"kama and moksha\". \"Punya\" and \"pāpa\" are the seeds of future pleasure and pain, the former, which sows merits, exhausts itself only through pleasure and the latter, which sows demerits, exhausts itself only through pain; but \"Jiwan mukti\" ends all karmic debts consisting of and signified by these two dynamics. \n\nDuring the Vedic period, \"brahmacharya\" practiced by the Brahmins was believed to ensure the desired gain of eternal life but owing to the changes in living patterns and increase in the demands of life, people veered towards Brahmaloka which the accumulation of merits of \"punya-karma\" ('good deeds or actions') seemed to promise and opted for the \"deva-yāna\" or 'the path of the gods'. The dynamics of \"karma\" played a large role in the development of Buddhist thought. The Buddhists believe that \"karma\" determines one’s nature and life-pattern but to them \"karma\" is \"chetnā\", a mental drive, a psychological phenomenon rather than a law governing substantial existence. The Buddhists consider Punya as the extraordinary force that confers happiness, as a spiritual merit which is one of the ten forms of balas (sources of strength) to a bodhisattva. They hold the belief that charity leads to the accumulation of punya or a happier rebirth on earth or a long sojourn in heaven. Buddha-knowledge (enlightenment) transcends even the law of karma.\n\nThe principle of \"Sthiti Bandha\" (duration-quality bondage), according to Jainism, involves attachment of \"karmic matter\" to the soul through \"anubhava bandha\" or \"rasa bandha\" which refers to the determination of the fruits of actions of the soul that such an attachment produces at the time of attachment of \"karmic matter\" or through \"pradesha bandha\" that deals with the quantum of \"karmic matter\" drawn towards the soul as determined by the soul’s actions. The \"karmic matter\" produced due to good activities of the mind, body and speech is the pleasant \"punya\" ('virtuous') \"karmic matter\" and that produced due to evil activities is the unpleasant \"pāpa\" ('sinful') \"karmic matter\". These \"karmas\" have to exhaust themselves to produce their results. \n\nThe Nyāya School understands \"dharma\" and \"adharma\" to refer to \"punya\" and \"pāpa\", with \"punya\" relating to one’s own or others’ well-being and \"pāpa\" relating to harm done to others, or in terms of doing one’s duties and their violation; it connects \"dharma\" to well-being and duty.\n\nThe concept of Karma, with the idea of rebirth as the background, was effectively introduced into Indian thought by Yajnavalkya in the course of his discussion with Jāratkārva Ārtabhāga who wanted to know about what happens after death (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad III.ii.13), whether present actions matter in respect of the experience of the after-death state and how human efforts and \"karma\" are inter-related. The Vedic people were multi-religious and believed in the existence of heaven and hell and in the transmigration of souls. For them the performance of \"yajna\" was important, and no \"yajna\" was complete or fruitful without \"dakshina\" i.e. the fee to the priests, and \"dāna\" i.e. charity, both deemed meritorious acts or \"punya-karma\"; they accepted the philosophy of sin (\"pāpa\") and merit (\"punya\"). \n\"Punya\" is a very ancient Sanskrit word which appears in the Rig veda. For instance, in a prayer to Kapinjala Ivendro Devata, Rishi Gutsamada, while describing the qualities of an \"upadeshaka\" ('teacher') states:\nin which \"mantra\" the word, \"punya\", is used to mean - 'good' or 'auspicious' or 'happy'. Many other Vedic texts, such as Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.ii.6) – पुण्यजितो लोकः (in which phrase \"aja\" refers to the Brahmaloka), have used it as meaning 'agreeable' or 'happy'. Otherwise, in Sanskrit literature, this word is used to indicate 'advantageous', 'good', 'convenient', 'beneficent' or 'purifying'; Manusmṛti also uses it meaning the same; however, the opposite of \"punya\" is \"apunya\", which means that the word, \"punya\" cannot at all places be translated as 'merit' or 'meritorious', more so because the word \"pāpa\" is most often translated as 'sin'. \n\nAdi Shankara exclaims:-\n\nIn his commentary on this stanza, Śri Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri explains that \"punya\" is the outcome of doing prescribed works, and \"pāpa\", the prohibited. All works pertaining to the body, to the mind and to speech are \"karma\", the good and bad with reference to actions make for \"punya\" and \"pāpa\" respectively; all actions and their outcome relate to the mind or to the body with form possessing sense-organs. The infinite bliss that Shankara speaks of is the \"sukha\" not generated by connection with sense-objects and therefore, in its experience there is no grief, no superimposition and no imagination whatsoever. During the Vedic period speaking untruth was a sin, and false accusers were the real sinners; performance of \"yajna\" washed away all such sins, which means ritual acts were associated with morality. Untruth and impurity could be washed away by water or wiped away by Darbha grass. Along with the concept of Rta (righteousness) there was the more prominent concept of \"anrta\", the opposite of righteousness or untruth; terms for good and evil were developed and a wicked person was called \"pāpa\", where after from the term, \"sādhu\" denoting what was right, was the concept of \"punya\" developed. Yajnavalkya explains – \n\nIn his commentary, Shankara states that the 'doing good' referred to here is the prescribed conduct (scriptural injunctions and prohibitions), actions are not prescribed for acts, good or evil prompted by desire and the cause of identification and transmigration, do not require habitual performance.\n"}

It's marketed as having 25% less sugar \"\"compared to regular low-fat chocolate milk\".\"\n\nThe Fairlife line of milk is distributed by Coca-Cola's Minute Maid division. \n\nIn regard to Coca-Cola's strategy for Fairlife, the company's North America President Sandy Douglas stated, \"Our vision for the nutrition beverage business and the milk product that I showed you which is made on a sustainable dairy with fully sustainable high-care processes with animals, has a proprietary milk filtering process that allows you to increase protein by 50 percent, take sugar down by 30 percent, and have no lactose, and a milk that's premiumised and taste better and we'll charge twice as much for it as the milk we're used to buying in a jug.\" The cost of Fairlife is indeed, roughly twice as high as conventional milk; Fairlife's national average price in the US is $4.29 per 52 oz., compared to the national average pricing of conventional milk at $2 per 64 oz.\n\nFollowing its widespread launch in February 2015, Khushbu Shah of Eater.com wrote that overall reviews of the milk was mixed, although that the chocolate variety, in particular, was generally well received. \n\nDietitians and nutritionists were generally critical of the milk; Alissa Rumsey, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics expressed, \"When you really look at the numbers, it can sound appealing, but in general most Americans are already getting enough protein,\" adding, \"If you need more, eat an egg or a handful of almonds. And people who need more calcium should up their intake of dark leafy greens, not the so-called Frankenmilk.\" Registered dietitian Keri Gans claimed, \"milk is already a great package of nutrients; I’m not quite sure why it needs to be changed,\" and commented on the removal of sugar in Fairlife milk with, \"I never looked at the sugar in milk as a problem.\" Meredith Engel of \"New York Daily News\" speculated that, \"it’s clear why Coke is trying to get into the milk business: More and more Americans are turning away from sugary soft drinks, and soda sales fell to a 19-year-low in 2013.\" \"Men's Health\" nutrition advisor Mike Roussell, however advised his clients to switch over to Fairlife's milk.\n\nHayley Peterson of \"Business Insider\" wrote, \"The chocolate milk was the crowd favorite. It's very sweet, but not overpowering, and the consistency is creamier and thicker than regular milk.\" Peterson adds that, \"most people agreed that the 2% milk tasted similar to whole milk. Many reviewers loved the milky taste, while others thought it was too overpowering.\" Sam Rega, a \"Business Insider\" video producer commented, \"Both skim and 2% had an after-taste, but otherwise I couldn't tell much of a difference from this and regular milk.\"\n\nWhile Chris Plante of \"The Verge\" commented, \"to my surprise, Fairlife tastes, well, like milk. It looks and feels a little thicker than traditional milk, and has a slightly richer taste, especially the chocolate milk, which sits on the spectrum between chocolate shake and milk that's stewed on a lazy Saturday morning in a bowl of Cocoa Puffs,\" he criticized the aftertaste, stating, \"Fairlife's aftertaste is less appealing. A few minutes sipping a cup of chocolate Fairlife and then a cup of 2% Fairlife, the inside of my mouth had that malty feel that chases a protein shake.\" Rachel Sanders of \"Buzzfeed\" observed, \"Fairlife is a little bit creepy to drink. The texture is much more viscous and thick than regular milk, and the odor is really strong, to the point that it smells almost spoiled. It tastes OK, but has a slightly musky flavor that reminds me of shelf-stable or reconstituted milk.\"\n"}

It dates to the early Cycladic period, between the 28th and 23 centuries BC (EC II). The frying pan derives from grave 74 of Chalandriani cemetery on the Cycladian island of Syros. It was discovered in 1889/90 during excavations led by Christos Tsountas, along with other pottery and was first published by Tsountas in 1899. With the inventory number 4974, the frying pan is now kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. The purpose of the frying pan is unknown.\n\nThe frying pan is 20.1 cm across and 28.2 cm from tip to grip. The plate has a round wall which is undecorated and projects outwards, forming the dish of the \"frying pan\". The incised decoration on the reverse is very deep. The entire plate, with the grips, is surrounded by a border of chip impressions. At the base of the handle, above the grips is an engraved pubic triangle. It is separated from the main field by another chip border. In the main field, stamped spirals, linked together by engraved lines, surround a ship which is engraved slightly below centre, opposite the handle. The hull and an upward pointing prow are depicted by engraved double lines. There is a fish symbol and two banners on the high prow. Above and below the hull, oars or rudders are suggested by slanting lines - a different number on each side. A unique feature compared to other frying pans is the orientation of the ship. It is the only known depiction of a ship with a high prow, which is usually identified as the bow, at the left end.\n\nExcept for a broken edge of the rim about 10 cm long, the frying pan is fully intact. It is made of a dark red, strong and coarse-grained clay. The slip on the outside is well-applied, but slightly spotty. On the inside, it is darker.\n\nThe quality of the work has been considered to be \"accomplished with great care and skill.\n\nFrying pans of the \"Chalandriani type\" are part of the final development of this form of ceramics and are dated to FC II. Their predecessors of the \"Aplomata type\" differ clearly in the tendency to circular bodies and in grip shape. By contrast, the frying pans of the \"Chalandriani type\" have an oval body and usually have little footed handles. The decorations known from the \"Aplomata type,\" like star motifs and interconnected spirals are often added to depictions of ships on spiral backgrounds.\n\nAt least ten frying pans with depictions of ships are known from the cemetery of Syros; one example has two ships. The individual ship depictions appear to be the product of only a few artists.\n\nChalandriani frying pans are further decorated with carving in the form of female genitalia, the so-called \"pubic triangle.\" Normally this takes the form of a triangular pattern with a central vertical line at the base of the handle. Examples are even known on the other side of the handle.\n\n\n"}

In this line-up they recorded their early demo tapes \"Cadaveric Incubator of Endo-Parasites\" (in 1993), \"Symphonies for Pathologist\" (in 1994) and \"Analyse of Pathological Conceptions\" (in 1995). In late 1995, Šmakal was replaced by Michal \"Cichoň\" Cichý, leading to Restel departing from the band, being replaced by Otto Beran and the band releasing a split EP with \"Decomposed\" titled \"Malignus Morbus with Decomposed\" and then three the next year with \"Immured\", \"Mastic Scum\" and \"In Growning\" called \"Forensic Clinicism – The Sanguine Article\", \"Sick Sinus Syndrome\" and \"Swarming of Virulency\".\n\nIn 1997, the band released a compilation split EP entitled \"Hungry Urinary Urn\" with \"Negligent Collateral Collapse\", \"C.S.S.O.\" and \"Catasexual Urge Motivation\" and released their split LP \"Eat the Flesh...and Vomica\" with \"Squash Bowels\". After the recording the album, Cichý and Beran left the band to focus on their other projects \"Cerebral Turbulency\" and \"Needful Things\".\n\nIn 1997, Marek \"Švejk\" Pavlík was hired to play drums, just as Bílek took over bass duties (leading to Richard Chrobok being hired as the band's guitarist). Lyrics changed from pathological topics to socially aware ones, opposing homophobia, inequality, racism and world slavery. The band then recorded the demo tape \"Killing for Profit\" in 1997 and split EPs \"Rock Stars – Money Wars\" with Dead Infection, and \"Murder for you to Eat\" with Vomito in 1998. Followed by a split LP \"Is this the Earth´s Last Century?\" with \"Alienation Mental\" and their first solo EP called \"Equality!?\" also in 1998. At the end of the same year, drummer Marek \"Švejk\" Pavlík left the band and Michal \"Cichoň\" Cichý returned.\n\nThe band a split tape, under this line-up, with Agathocles, \"Abortion\" and \"Din-Addict\". Cichý was soon replaced by Michal \"Kameň\" Kaminsky, before Chrobok also departed in mid-2000, being replaced by Marek Marunič. The band then recorded and released two split EPs \"Man made the End\" with Agathocles and \"Get to Attack\" with Unholy Grave. After disagreements began with Marunič, he left the band and Bílek took over guitar once more, picking up Petr \"Dino\" Šarina as their new bass player, who only lasted a few performances.\n\nBílek relocated from the Czech republic to the Netherlands, in which an entirely new line-up was formed, including brothers Johan and Jelle Smits on drums and bass, respectively. This line-up released the split EP \"Oegstgeest Grindcore\" with Intumescence in 2002, double split EP \"In Oil We Trust\" with Critical Madness, Szargyerek and Anubis and the band's first full-length LP \"Dawn of the New Age\" in 2003.

With this new line-up the music was slowly evolved from raw crust punk to a dirtier rock and roll style with a crusty edge, evident on the band's next split EP \"Hammer and Anvil\" with \"Lycathrophy\" from 2004. In summer 2004 Martin \"Marsel\" Ondejka departed without notice, being replaced by drummer David Ševčík, who has also worked with bands such as \"Dysentry\" and \"Večírek\". The band then built upon this \"crust´n´roll\" style on their second full-length album \"Burninhell\" released in 2005, the album was rated as the third best album of the year in the Břitva music awards. On this album guitarist Martin \"Korál\" Vyorálek made a guest appearance, having played in both \"Erebus\" and \"GG Pump\", officially joining later that year. Together the band, recorded their next split LP, entitled \"Rock´n´Roll Engine\" in 2006, with \"Gurkha\". This split got again very good reviews and wound up as the third best mini-album of the year, according to the Břitva music awards.\n\nIn the Summer of 2008, the band´s next album \"In Full Swing\" was released, which lead the band to become compared to Motörhead by press and fans, however the band disregards these statements, taking them as a compliment. The album was rated very high by reviewerss and was nominated as album of the year in the Czech Anděl Music Awards in the category of Hard&Heavy, and wound up at the second spot, after winner \"První Hoře\". Two years later, the band recorded in the German recording studio Stage One, for their next album called \"Earthshaker\", this was their first time with a professional producer, being Andy Classen. The album was received moderate to good reviews, leading to the band winning the album of the year in Anděl Award in Hard&Heavy category in 2010 and wound up second in Břitva.\n\nIn December 2012 drummer David Ševčík left the band and his place was taken over by Petr \"Bohdič\" Bohda, who had previously worked with bands including \"El Ray\", \"GG Pump\", \"Erebus\", \"Citron\", \"Pouze Znouze\" and \"Nagauč\". In early 2013, the band entered Stage One Studio, once again, to record their next album \"Overdose&Overdrive\" again with Andy Classen as producer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have played over a thousand performances on three continents. In 2010, Malignant Tumour's \"Earthshaker\" won the Anděl Award for Album of the Year in the category of Hard&Heavy.

When reporting on the introduction of the beer in 2013, \"The Oregonian\" newspaper originally stated that the \"Huffington Post\" had been taken in by an April Fools' Day joke, but the \"Oregonian\" writer was contacted by a Rogue employee, and reported a few days later that it was not a joke. During development, the beer's working name was \"New Crustacean\".\n\nRogue set out to find a local wild yeast to complement the locally sourced hops and grains used in their other ales, to \"increase the terroir\" of the finished product. Unsuitable samples were taken from various places, including the company's hopyard in Independence, Oregon, before the brewmaster's beard was tried.\n\nIsolating and cultivating a new wild yeast or strain of bacteria can be difficult, resulting in \"rediscovery\" of already utilized organisms. Analysis of the yeast cultivated from Maier's beard showed that it was a new strain, perhaps a hybrid incorporating genes from Rogue's house yeast called \"Pacman\". \n\nBeverages produced with local American native yeast are collectively known as the American wild ale style, of which Beard Beer is an example. Other American breweries have been successful in developing lines of brewer's yeast from a number of local wild sources, including Dogfish Head Brewery (cultivated from skins of Delaware peaches), Lost Rhino Brewing (captured at Janelia Farm) Mystic Brewing (Massachusetts plums),\nand Linden Street Brewery (cultivated from San Francisco sourdough).\n\n\"Willamette Week\"s reviewer said \"The beer itself is quite normal: a sweet, bread-y American wild ale without much to distinguish it beyond a notable pineapple flavor.\" Writing for \"The Baltimore Sun\", another reviewer praised the beer's \"smooth finish and citrus notes\". \"xoJane\"s reviewer questioned Rogue's \"gimmicky\" beers in its lineup, but concluded its \"sweet and bready and kinda pineapple-y\" taste was reminiscent of a Belgian single. A review from the website \"Flavor 574\" described the beer as having a funky flavor. \"Details\" magazine included the brew on their \"Best Weird Brews of Summer\" list in 2013; and \"Gayot Guides\" lists it among its top ten weird beers, profiling it as \"reminiscent of a Belgian saison, with a hazy orangish hue and flavors of bready malt, spicy peppercorn, tropical mango, passion fruit and pineapple\". \"Paste\" magazine listed it as \"really weird\" along with beers including pickle, meteorite dust, and scorpion. \"The Massachusetts Daily Collegian\" reviewed it at length, noting it \"meld[s] odors of smoke, olives and nebulously Belgian-influenced yeast... funky aromatic notes... initial citrusy sourness is balanced out by the fullness of toasted bread laced with a tangy sweetness... a simultaneously sour and sweet flavor complexion... traces of some distinctly Belgian elements... more closely aligned with saison and farmhouse ale styles\". Daniel Tapper from the UK daily \"The Guardian\" reviewed five wild beers and called Beard Beer \"the weirdest beer I've ever tried\" and described it as containing notes of banana, passionfruit and pineapple.\n\nAn article from \"The New Zealand Herald\" published in 2014 listed the beard hair used in Rogue Beard Beer as the number one strangest craft beer ingredient, ahead of other additions including cat feces and bull's testicles. Rogue made the \"New Zealand Herald\" list twice, with the additional inclusion of its maple bacon ale, co-branded with Portland's Voodoo Doughnut.\n\n"}

They contain flour, sugar, orange rind and ground almonds(intrita). They are vegan, since they contain no animal protein, eggs, or dairy products.\n\nKwarezimal was developed by the Knights of Malta. The word kwarezimal refers to quaresima, the forty days of Lent. Sugar was not avoided during Lent as some practice it today. Unlike today, sugar was considered a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities.\n\nIn medieval Europe, animal products were to be avoided during times of penance. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, but that did not mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against moderate drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days were popular occasions for serving food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be molded to look like venison and imitation eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking it in coals.\n\nAccording to lore, and many Bible scholars, St Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked off the coast of Malta in 60 A.D. on his way to Rome to face trial, and swam safely ashore. St Paul is also said to have introduced Christianity to Malta, making it one of the earliest outposts of the faith.\n\nThe era of the Knights of St John reinforced the islands’ Christian tradition, and Maltese culture and social life are heavily influenced by its faith (the islands are 98 percent Roman Catholic). Church attendance in Malta is among the highest in Europe, although it is declining. Many traditional Maltese sweets and pastries are only available at certain times of the year, bound to the Catholic liturgical calendar—such as \"kwareżimal.\"\n\nKwareżimal are a kind of chewy biscuit made with spices and ground almonds, a humble recipe originally made without eggs or butter, because during Lent, abstaining from eating animal products or animal meat was considered a penance. (Sugar, it should be noted, was not taboo because it was considered a spice and therefore savory.) The word kwareżimal stems from the Italian word \"quarezima\", referring to the 40 days of Lent fasting.\n"}

{"id": "45492973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45492973", "title": "Prop-word", "text": "Prop-word\n\nA prop-word is a word with little or no semantic content used where grammar dictates a certain sentence member, e.g., to provide a \"support\" on which to hang a modifier. The word most commonly considered as a prop-word in English is \"one\" (with the plural form \"ones\").\n\nThe prop-word \"one\" takes the place of a countable noun in a noun phrase (or determiner phrase), normally in a context where it is clear which noun it is replacing. For example, in a context in which hats are being talked about, \"the red one\" means \"the red hat\", and \"the ones we bought\" means \"the hats we bought\". The prop-word thus functions somewhat similarly to a pronoun, except that a pronoun usually takes the place of a whole noun (determiner) phrase (for example, \"the red hat\" may be replaced by the pronoun \"it\").\n\nThe prop-word can generally be used with any of the modifiers that can typically accompany nouns. These include articles and other determiners, attributive adjectives, prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and certain others (see Components of noun phrases). Some examples of its use are given below:\n\nIn standard English, the prop-word \"one\" cannot appear immediately after the indefinite article: \"a one (...)\" would be replaced by simply \"one (...)\" (analyzable as an ordinary pronoun or numeral). However, \"a one\" is possible in some dialects. \n\nOther words with limited semantic content that may sometimes be classed as prop-words include \"person\" and \"thing\". In English, certain combinations of determiner and prop-word have developed into indefinite pronouns: \"somebody\", \"anyone\", \"nothing\", etc.\n\nThis relatively minor topic of English syntax was a matter of a rather significant and prolonged discussion about the origin of the phrase \"a good one\", which involved such experts as Eugen Einenkel, Karl Luick, Otto Jespersen, Matti Rissanen, among others, until the consensus of the authorities was established by Bruce Mitchell in his \"Old English Syntax\".

Consumers typically pay higher prices for specialty foods, and may perceive them as having various benefits compared to non-specialty foods. Compared to staple foods, specialty foods may have higher prices due to more expensive ingredients and labor. Some food stores specialize in or predominantly purvey specialty foods. Several organizations exist that promote specialty foods and its purveyors.\n\nThe term \"specialty foods\" does not have a standard definition. Food processors, regulators and consumers may be confused by the term due to its potential ambiguity.\n\nFoods that have been described as specialty foods include:\n\nSome specialty foods may be ethnic specialties.\n\nFoods that have been described as specialty foods as per not precisely corresponding to other food categories include:\n\nIn China, specialty foods have been described as having \"important roles in the food culture...\" Some Chinese recipes may be footnoted with a statement that ingredients may only be available in specialty food stores and Chinese markets.\n\nIn the United States, specialty foods and their purveyors are regulated by both federal and state agencies.\n\nThe Specialty Food Association's annual \"State of the Specialty Food Industry 2014\" report stated that in 2013 in the U.S., specialty foods and beverages sales totaled $88.3 billion, accounted for an increase of 18.4% since 2011, and was a record high for the fourth consecutive year. The report also stated that around 80% of specialty food sales occur at the retail level, and that seven out of ten specialty food retailers reported that the word \"local\" had the most importance as a product claim.\n\nAs of March 2015 in the United States, the number of bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturers (companies that process cocoa beans into a product in-house, rather than melting chocolate from another manufacturer) had increased to at least 60. The Fine Chocolate Industry Association stated that this represented \"a tenfold increase in the past decade that's outpacing growth in Europe\".\n\nIn 2012 in the United States, the specialty foods market sector was experiencing significant growth, with its annual growth rate at 8–10%. In 2010, specialty foods comprised 13.1% of total retail food sales and totaled $55.9 billion in sales.\n\nIn 2010 in Oakland, California it was reported that abandoned industrial spaces previously occupied by large food producers were being inhabited by small specialty food companies.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. state of California had the second-highest amount of specialty and gourmet foods of all U.S. states. This has been attributed as possible due a diverse variety of unique fruits and vegetables that can be grown in Southern California. Another possibility for the high quantity and diversity of specialty foods in California is that food innovations often occur in the state, as has occurred in other sectors such as health food and organic produce.\n\nIn 1991, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that city officials in Monterey Park, Los Angeles County, California, suspected that significant numbers of non-residents were visiting the city to shop at Asian markets there to obtain specialty foods.\n\nIn terms of food-place association perceptions, Vermont has been described as being associated with \"homemade-style specialty items\", along with maple syrup.\n\nSome companies, grocery stores and food stores specialize in or predominantly purvey specialty foods. Some of these companies include:\n\nAlso known as the Specialty Food Association, it is a non-profit trade association founded in 1952 in New York that has over 3,000 members. The organization also oversees its Specialty Food Foundation, a foundation that \"works to reduce hunger and increase food recovery efforts via grantmaking, education and industry events\".\n\n\n\n\nIn New York's Finger Lakes region, the Worker Ownership Resource Center established the Specialty Food Network. The network was established to \"help clients start or expand small food businesses\" and to promote the businesses and products of its members. Establishment of the network was enabled in part with a grant from the John Merck Fund. In 1998, the network had 46 members.\n\n\n\n\n"}

First invented by Boston Pizza, recipes were posted online as early as April 2014, though they did not become viral until the Pillsbury Company posted an example in September 2014. It has since become popular in the United States. Reviews have been mixed, with praise aimed at its taste and criticism leveled at its complexity and unhealthiness.\n\nIn April 2014, the Canadian-based chain Boston Pizza included the pizza cake as part of its Pizza Game Changers promotion, which featured numerous \"outlandish\" pizza-related products. The recipe quickly became the promotion's most popular, receiving 15,000 votes by 21 April – more than five times as much as its nearest competitor, the pizza mint. It held this position until the promotion closed. The company advertised the concoction as \"great for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, weddings, and even lonely nights watching infomercials\".\n\nInspired by the Boston Pizza promotion, later in April a recipe for pizza cake was posted to the So Good Blog; one Reddit user who tried the recipe described it as \"heavenly\", though with a strong \"food hangover\". In September 2014, a recipe for pizza cake by Shawn Syphus was posted by the Pillsbury Company. It soon circulated widely on the internet, becoming viral; the company was sometimes mistakenly attributed with originating the recipe.\n\nThe So Good Blog recipe calls for regular pizza dough, rolled into a layer thick, out of which six round pieces 6 1/3 inches (16 cm) in diameter are cut. These rounds are cooked in a preheated oven for 15 minutes, then allowed to cool. Meanwhile, baking powder is sprinkled into a pot, the sides of which are then lined with a thick layer of dough. When this is complete and the rounds are cooled, a round is placed at the bottom, then covered in pizza ingredients (including sauce, pepperoni, and cheese); this step is repeated until the pot is filled. After excess dough is trimmed off and the edges are tucked in, the pizza cake is baked for 45 minutes.\n\nThe Pillsbury recipe which went viral in September 2014 had a similar, though smaller, recipe which called for less cooking time. The recipe recommended a pan with tall sides (square or round), and called for three layers of dough and a total of 28–33 minutes of cooking time (8 for the rounds and 20–25 for the finished pizza).\n\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" gave a total of 5,000 calories for a six-layer Boston Pizza pizza cake. The \"Daily Mail\", reviewing the Pillsbury recipe, estimated that each pizza cake had 3,818 calories, or 636 per slice of the layered pie.\n\nPeter Sagal of NPR found the recipe was more complicated than it appeared, writing \"It's not exactly (how much you like pizza) × (number of layers)\", and that the pizza cake lost the crispiness of the crust. He concluded that the recipe was fun to make, and the \"obscene amount of cheese\" being eaten makes one forget issues with the crust. Rosanne Salvatore, writing for the online magazine \"Bustle\", considered the cake worth recommending despite the amount of work and expense required; she concluded \"I created a miracle [the pizza cake] with my bare hands\".\n\nApril Blake, writing in the \"Cleveland Free Times\", had a more negative view of the recipe. She considered it difficult to prepare, lacking crispiness in the crust, and more unhealthy than a regular pizza.\n\n\n"}

This is a kind of tortelli that doesn't exist elsewhere in Italy as the filling is sweet.\n\nThe tortelli cremaschi may have been born during the long Republic of Venice . In support of this theory there are at least two factors: the first is that nowadays it's a typical dish known only in the city of Crema, actually within the borders of the ancient territory of Crema which belonged to Venice. The second one due to the ingredients of the filling: amaretti biscuits, spices, candied fruit and raisins are all goods which came from the trades with the Orient, which were under the monopoly of the Venetians for centuries.\n\nThe modern recipe dates from the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe tortelli represent, in Crema, the most important dish of a celebration; they are usually prepared for festivals, weddings or other family events; however they aren't Christmas or Easter food and virtually every village and every family has its own recipe, slightly different from the next.\n\nIt appears that the shape of the tortelli is unique in Italian gastronomy: a small amount of filling is placed in the middle of a small circle of dough, which is then folded over into a half-moon, the edges superimposed by hand and pinched together to create five crests. In some villages, people make them in a square and use a fork to press them closed, but this does not conform to the tradition. The \"cremaschi\" of ancient times said that the use of the fork was used by countrymen to save money, in that there would have been no waste of dough.\n\nThe tortelli have a balance of flavors, with a sweet and spicy filling, while traditional pasta and condiments are savory, gelatinous and fatty. The 'secret' is due to the perfect balance between the quantity of the filling and the dough so as to maintain the harmony; they must be made with pasta and filling balanced in the correct proportions. They have to be formed in rather thick envelopes of pasta and cooked for a relatively long time, from 20 to 40 minutes. \nEgg pasta is not suitable here because, in cooking, it tends to lose the filling.\n\n\nTo prepare the dough, one adds all the flour to lightly salted hot water and kneads until an elastic ball is formed; at the end of the kneading the colour should be a light grey. If desired one could use a pasta maker adding only one egg for each kilo of flour, and a spoonful of oil to give more elasticity to the mixture. Any recipe that uses more than one egg per kilo of flour is not considered traditional and does not work well.\n\n\nSome people add meat or broth, but such don't belong to the traditional recipe.\n\nTo prepare the filling, pour it in a mixing bowl and then add the crumbed amaretti biscuits, the softened and dried raisin, the crumbled Mostaccino biscuit, the grated mint candies, grated citrus peel, grated cheese, the egg yolk, the lemon skin, a bit of breadcrumbs, the Marsala and if necessary a bit of broth to make the misture softer. Let it stand in the fridge for an entire day. The following day prepare the dough and let it rest in a wrapped in a cloth for about an hour; stretch it out to create circles, parcel out the individual filling portions and fold them into half moon shaped pockets of dough, minding to press the edges three times. Cook in salted boiling water stirring gently occasionally, to prevent the tortelli from sticking together\n\nLayer the tortelli in a wide soup tureen, wetting them with the condiment and adding the grated Grana cheese, let them rest for a few minutes before serving.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as Persian Cucumber and Tomato Salad. Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion and lemon juice, although lime juice or verjuice is sometimes used in its preparation. In Iran, it is eaten in the summer as a side dish on its own, and year-round as a side dish alongside meat-based foods such as kebab or steak, and as a side dish before and after meals. Shirazi salad is sometimes served as an accompaniment to rice. Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer.\n\nShirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews. It typically has a crisp and moist texture, and is somewhat similar to pico de gallo and Israeli salad.\n\nThe primary ingredients of Shirazi salad consist of small, finely-diced cucumber, tomato and onion, which is mixed with fresh lemon or lime juice and some dried mint. Olive oil, salt, and pepper may be used, and additional ingredients may include chopped mint, parsley, scallions, dill, sumac, red vinegar, and unripe grape juice. The salad may have a sour and salty flavor, and its flavor may increase after being set for an hour or longer before serving, which allows time for the flavors to intermingle. It may be served with breads such as pita and lavash, or with cheese and/or walnuts.\n\n"}

Electric- or gas-powered heating elements may be used, which use adjustable infrared heat. These types of rotisseries have proven quite functional for cooking rotisserie-style chicken. Leftover rotisserie chicken may be used in a variety of dishes, such as soup, chicken salad, and sandwiches.\n\nIn the United States, ready-to-eat rotisserie chickens were available in supermarkets and some butcher shops during much of the twentieth century. However, they did not become a widely available option for consumers until the early 1990s, when Boston Market helped popularize the selling of packaged rotisserie chickens.\n\nRotisserie chickens are now highly popular. In 2010, 600 million rotisserie-cooked chickens were purchased by consumers \"in U.S. supermarkets, club stores and similar retail outlets.\" In 2018, over 900 million rotisserie chickens were sold by foodservice outlets and retail stores.\n\nRotisserie chickens are often lower in price than raw whole chickens. Two explanations are often given to justify this phenomenon. First, some grocery stores may use rotisserie chickens as loss leaders to bring shoppers into the store. The logic behind this theory is that if customers come to a store for its rotisseries chickens, they will buy other products while they are there, too. Second, rotisserie chickens are often made with poultry that is about to reach its \"best by\" date. By cooking and selling the chickens, the grocery stores are able to recoup some of their expenditures. \n\nIn the U.S., chickens used for rotisserie cooking may be injected with brine to retain moisture. Additional ingredients may be used to add flavor and to brown the chicken, such as oleoresin, yeast extract, sodium tripolyphosphate, and natural flavorings.\n\nCostco is one of the largest producers and vendors of rotisserie chickens in the United States, with one commentator describing it as \"the undisputed king of rotisserie chickens.\" In 2017, Costco sold approximately 87 million rotisserie chickens in the United States. Costco's CFO, Richard Galanti, has repeatedly rebuffed suggestions that Costco might eventually increase the cost of its chickens above $4.99, which has been the price of a Costco rotisserie chicken since 2009. \n\nIn 2017, Costco broke ground on a new 414-acre facility in Fremont, Nebraska that would include a hatchery, feed mill, and processing plant. The facility – which is expected to produce around 100 million chickens per year, or roughly 40 percent of Costco's needs – has been reported as costing between $275 million and $400 million. The plant is scheduled to open in September 2019.\n\nSwiss Chalet, a Canadian chain of casual dining restaurants, owns a cable channel that exclusively airs content related to rotisserie chicken, \"twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\" It typically airs chickens rotating on a rotisserie. Occasionally, a dancing man appears wearing a costume that \"look like a container of Swiss Chalet's dipping sauce.\"\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a frequent consumer of rotisserie chickens.\n\n\n"}

The pastry's name is etymologically related to \"bomba\" (bomb), and the same type of pastry is also called bomba (\"pl.\" \"bombe\") in some regions of Italy. The etymological connection is probably due to the resemblance to a grenade or old-fashioned bomb and may today possibly also be regarded as a reference to the very high calorie density of this recipe (i.e., a \"calorie bomb\").\n\nWhile \"bomboloni\" may be primarily connected to Tuscany, they are traditional to other regions of Italy, although with slight variations on the recipe. In those areas that used to be under Austrian rule, such as Trentino Alto-Adige, Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the tradition of bomboloni is believed to have originated from that of Austrian \"krapfen\" (i.e., Berliner), and the recipe includes eggs, which are not found in the Tuscan variety.\n\n\"Pasticcerie\" sometimes have handwritten signs for them, and food writer Emily Wise wrote that visitors might not be as taken with hot filled doughnuts in an area with wild boar salami and sandwiches with truffle oil on offer, but that residents of Tuscany enjoy them even at the beach. They are also sold from carts on the beach and are a bit distinct from the filled doughnuts in other countries by having the filling put in from the top, where it is sometimes visible, rather than injected from the side.\n\nThe A Voce restaurant in New York has served them with chocolate sauce and Florentines have been said to prefer the bomboloni \"caldi\" (hot) at Buscioni, where they're served \"straight from the oven\" and filled with custard, chocolate, or marmalade.\n\nItalian singer Gianna Nannini's 1996 compilation is titled \"Bomboloni\" and includes the song \"Bomboloni\" with lyrics about hot doughnuts and bombs. The music video features tribal dancing, costumes, round black bombs with fuses, and lots of doughnuts being eaten, hit with baseball bats, and thrown around.\n"}

This action required use of a traditional container used for serving soups, such as a deep, spherical bowl or dish. This container usually had no handles, was made of clay, in a dome form and somewhat narrow. This practice was very popular historically. It is still practised today notably among older people in the countryside.\n\nPeople from Périgord perform \"fà chabroù\", in Limousin one performs \"chabrot\", while in Provence, Frédéric Mistral explains that \"cabroù\" comes from the Latin \"capreolus\". To perform \"faire chabrot\", is therefore \"to drink like a goat .\" In Poitou and in Saintonge, the word \"godaille\" is also used. In Gascon, they use the term \"godala\" (likely a metathesis of \"goulade\", \"gulp\").\n\nThis practice appears to have existed north of the Loire: in the last volume of \"Chronique des Pasquier\", Georges Duhamel writes of a longstanding practice, \"It was a custom of my father,\" which was called \"champorot\" and was chabrot.\n\nChabrot continues, notably in the Southwest of France. Jean Rebier (1879-1966), founder of the revue \"Lemouzi\", describes the practice of chabrot as still relevant, \"The soupe is regularly followed by a nice chabròl.\" Just as the ethnologist Albert Goursaud, deceased 1975, still talks about in the present, in his book \"The traditional rural society of Limousin: ethnography and folklore of Haut-Limousin and Basse-Marche\" published the year after his death. In his work, he distinguishes lost traditions from those that continued at the time he wrote it. Chabrot was performed commonly, at least in the countryside, just until the middle of the 20th century.\n\nCatalan Jaume Fàbrega, born in 1948, indicates in \"Cuina del país dels càtars\" that while young, he witnessed at home \"lo cabròt\". Roland Manoury, musicologist and poet of Auvergne, created a march of glory for chabrot that is traditionally accompanied by accordion. Its refrain asserts:\n\nToday, chabrot is considered an old and rural gesture, but on certain occasions it can be performed in all environments, in a spirit of connivance and friendliness. During a meal between gastronomists, Philippe Faure-Brac, best sommelier (wine steward) in the world in 1992, owner of « Bistrot du Sommelier » in Paris, and member of GJE, rose and asked for permission to perform \"chabrot\" with the rest of his cream of mushroom soup and some 1998 Cheval Blanc. Pierre Lurton, director of the societies of châteaus of Yquem and Cheval Blanc, replied by pouring the bottom of his glass into the soup. Everyone did the same. This modern version of chabrot consisted of tasting the mixture with a spoon, but no one drank directly from the dish.\n\n"}

Parasites and enteropathogenic bacteria have been found in samples of \"naem\". Lactic acid formed during its fermentation inhibits the growth of \"Salmonella\". \"Lactobacillus curvatus\" use in the product has been proven to prevent the growth of pathogenic bacteria in \"naem\".

Minced beef is sometimes used in its preparation. After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags and left to ferment for three to five days. \"Naem\" has a sour quality to it due to the fermentation, in which lactic acid bacteria and yeasts grow within the sausage. The lactic acid bacteria and yeasts expand by feeding upon the rice and sugar, and the use of salt prevents the meat from rotting.\n\nNaem typically has a short shelf life, which can be extended through refrigeration. The sausage can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to prepare. In Thailand, it is typically stored at room temperature, which gives it a shelf life of around one week. It is also produced in areas of Southeast Asia near Thailand.\n\n\"Naem\" is often consumed raw, (after fermentation has occurred), and is often accompanied with shallot, ginger, bird's eye chili peppers and spring onions. It is used as an ingredient in various dishes such as \"naem\" fried with eggs, \"Naem khao\" and \"Naem phat wun sen sai khai\", and is also consumed as a side dish and as a condiment.

Different regions of Thailand have different preferred flavors: northern and northeastern pork is a little bit sour, central is sour, and southern is spicy.\n\nDishes prepared with \"naem\" include \"naem\" fried with eggs, and \"naem\" fried rice. \"Naem phat wun sen sai khai\" is a dish prepared with \"naem\", glass noodles and eggs, among other ingredients such as spring onions and red pepper. \"Naem khao\" is a salad dish in Lao cuisine prepared using Lao fermented pork sausage, rice, coconut, peanuts, mint, cilantro, fish sauce, and lemon juice. \"Naem\" and rice are formed into balls, deep-fried, and then served broken atop the various ingredients. Serenade, a restaurant in Bangkok, makes a dish called the \"McNaem\", which consists of a duck egg wrapped in \"naem\" that is fried and then served with risotto, slaw, shiitake mushrooms, herbs, and cooked sea scallops atop crushed garlic.\n\nThere are many applications of sour pork with different flavors such as \"phat phet naem\" (), \"tom kha naem\" (), \"ho mok naem\" (), and \"naem priao wan\" ().\n\nA serving size of of \"naem\" has 185 kilocalories, protein, fat, and carbohydrate.

In the United States, vegetable chips are often mass-produced, with many brands marketed to consumers.\n\nWhile potato chips are, strictly speaking, \"vegetable chips\", they are usually considered separately. This article focuses on non-potato vegetable chips.\n\nVegetable chips may be prepared with sliced vegetables that are fried, deep-fried, baked, dehydrated, or simply dried. Vegetable chips may be produced from a variety of root vegetables and leaf vegetables, such as carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, radish, taro root, sweet potato, garlic, zucchini, cassava, kale, spinach, fennel and jicama, among others. Some baked versions utilize vegetables that are sliced, lightly tossed in oil, and then oven-baked until crisp. Vegetable chips prepared using this method have been described as more healthful compared to deep fried chips, particularly when prepared using \"heart-healthy\" olive oil.\n\nSimple versions are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline is used to slice vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.\n\nCarrot chips are carrots that have been fried or dehydrated. Some U.S. companies mass-produce and purvey carrot chips to consumers, such as Connecticut Country Fair Snacks, Ltd. and Caroff Foods Corporation, among others.\n\nCassava chips are a common food in much of Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava chips are called \"konkonte\". Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.\n\nIn addition to prepared cassava chips from thinly sliced raw cassava root that is then immediately fried or deep-fried, chips may be prepared in a multi-stage process, starting with a dough made from cassava flour. The dough is steamed, thinly sliced, dried, and then fried in oil. This style of cassava flour chips is a popular food in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nVegetable chips may be consumed as a snack food, and may be accompanied with various dips such as salsa, guacamole, and bean dips. They are also used as a topping for soups, salads and other dishes.\n\nIn the United States, varieties of vegetable chips are mass-produced and purveyed in supermarkets.\n\nBrands of vegetable chips (other than potato chips) include Calbee, Beanitos, Terra, Food Should Taste Good, JicaChips, Sensible Portions, and Uprooted, among others.

Chips used include potato chips, tortilla chips, corn chips, bean chips, vegetable chips, pita chips, plantain chips and others. Crackers are also sometimes used, as are crudités, which are whole or sliced raw vegetables. Various types of dips are used to accompany various types of chips.\n\nChips and dip gained significant popularity in the United States during the 1950s, in part due to a Lipton advertising campaign for their French onion dip recipe, sometimes referred to as \"California dip\". Specialized trays and serving dishes designed to hold both chips and dip were created during this time. Chips and dip are frequently served during the Super Bowl American football game in the United States. National Chip and Dip Day occurs annually in the U.S. on March 23.\n\nThe popularity of chips and dip significantly increased in the United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant dehydrated onion soup mix to prepare dip. The advertising campaign occurred on television and in supermarket display advertising, and promoted mixing the soup mix with sour cream or cream cheese to create a dip, to be served with potato chips or crudités. This dip began to be called California Dip. The advertising campaign realized significant success, and new, similar dip products were quickly developed thereafter. During this time, unique platters designed for chips and dip service were created that allowed for the containment of several types of chips, and service variations were devised that included serving the dip in a bread bowl or hollowed-out fruit.\n\nChips and dip are a popular food during the annual Super Bowl game in the United States. Eighty-five percent of Americans eat potato chips.\n\nChips and salsa, typically served using tortilla or corn chips, is a common type of chips and dip dish that gained significant popularity in the United States in the late 1980s. Chips and guacamole, also typically served with corn-based chips is another type, as well as chips and bean dip. Seven-layer dip and tortilla chips is another corn-based chip combination, as is chile con queso, an appetizer or side dish of melted cheese and chili pepper typically served in Tex-Mex restaurants as a sauce for nachos.\n\nDouble-dipping involves biting a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip, which some people disapprove, while others are indifferent. Double-dipping ostensibly transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumers' mouths.\n\nIn March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated that they would not consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping.\n\nA study performed by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Clemson University claimed that three to six instances of double-dipping \"would transfer about 10,000 bacteria from the eater’s mouth to the remaining dip,\" which corresponds with \"about 50-100 bacteria from one mouth to another, in every bite.\" The study's conclusion recommended that double-dipping should, in their opinion, be curtailed, including tips to prevent it from occurring.\n\nA segment on \"MythBusters\" in 2009 tested how much bacteria is transferred during the process of double-dipping, finding that there is a transfer but that it, \"adds only a few more microbes\".\n\nNational Chip and Dip Day occurs in the United States annually on March 23. Tostitos-brand tortilla chips, a major U.S. brand, observed the day in 2015 by providing coupons for free dip for interested customers named \"Chip\".\n\nDouble-dipping was used as a plot point in the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Implant\". One of the main characters, George, argues at a funeral reception with his girlfriend's brother (Timmy) when he is accused of double-dipping a chip. This episode inspired the 2009 segment on \"MythBusters\".\n\n\n"}

Salva is traditionally eaten in the central plain of Lombardy and produced particularly in the area of Crema, Bergamo and Brescia.\n\nIt is also produced in the provinces of Lecco, Lodi and Milan. Salva has many similarities to quartirolo, as well as differences, like longer aging and a major aromatic complexity.\n\nIts name comes from the idea of “salvare il latte”, which is the tradition of using or saving the milk left over from the spring process of cheese-making, which is then used to produce Salva cheese.\nIt is called Salva cremasco although it is more often produced elsewhere, because Crema was the main place of trading and consumption of this cheese, like it has occurred to other kinds of cheese (ex. Bra, Gorgonzola).\n\nIts origins date back to the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was already possible to identify on some decorative truckles the cheese profile, which looks like a parallelepiped, with a thin crust and a pastry with very rare holes in the pastry (called \"occhiature\") and straw-white colour. Salva has a close connection with the seasonal transhumance that the “bergamini” (shepherds from Bergamo) undertook with their cows, coming down from the villages in the valleys of Bergamo and Brescia towards farms in the plain in autumn and going back in spring. During these trips the milk overproduced, particurarly plentiful in spring, was transformed into \"strachì da Salva\", so that it could be preserved in the hot season. It seems that the warlord Bartolomeo Colleoni enjoyed this cheese so much that he had some truckles delivered during his military inspections at the fortificatios of Crema.\n\nFor its production full-cream pasteurized milk is used. Its coagulation, at , lasts 30 minutes, then the curd is twice chopped in extremely little fragments. Finally, the bulk mass is put for 8–16 hours in a damp location. The aging lasts either 3–5 months (in this case the product has an aromatic and fragrant flavour), or 8–12 months. There are rare truckles aged up to 36 months. Sometimes the crust is flavoured with marcs.\nThe truckle has a parallelepiped shape with a plain squared side 11/13 cm or 17/19 cm long and a straight bowed side from 9 to 15 cm. The average weight spaces from . The crust is washed with water and salt, while as concerns cheese aged for a longer time it is oiled. In the past, linseed oil was used. In this way, some yellow mildew is built up, which penetrating into the crust increase the flavour.\nOn 21 November 2002, the consortium for the safeguard of the Salva Cremasco was set up, and then this kind of cheese was qualified as PDO, due to its typicalness and well proved productive tradition. The cheese is identified, apart from its cubic or parallelepiped shape, due to its typical brand with capital letters S C on its face.\n\nThe most typical use of this kind cheese in the area of Crema is the “Salva con le tighe” (green Lombard peppers in vinegar). The Salva is cut in little cubes, with tighe grossly cut into stripes without seeds. Then it is flavoured with a bit of olive oil. According to taste, wehave to let the cheese rest to become tasty, without exceeding as oil makes the cheese macerate.\n\nThe salva can also be used in a variety of other dishes, going from starters to desserts, and from first to second courses.\n\n\n"}

It has a significant buttery flavor, which has been compared to that of French toast. Fried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century.\n\nThe debut of deep-fried butter in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada may have led to a rise in attendance at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.\n\nAbel Gonzales Jr., also known as \"Fried Jesus\", of Dallas, Texas, invented deep-fried butter, serving it at the 2009 State Fair of Texas in Dallas, Texas. Prepared using frozen, battered butter, it was awarded the \"Most Creative food prize\" at that time.\n\nA version of deep-fried butter on a stick debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was prepared using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served on a stick at the State Fair of Texas.\n\nIn 2011 at the Orange County Fair in Costa Mesa, California, deep-fried butter was paired with chocolate-covered bacon and dubbed the \"coronary combo.\" ABC News made a comparison regarding the pricing of this food pairing, stating, \"the $10.50 price rivaled some health plans' co-payments for a visit to a cardiologist.\" This dish has also been served at other events and venues, such as the State Fair of Virginia and the Musikfest music festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland, a pub named The Fiddler's Elbow served a dessert dish named \"Braveheart Butter Bombs\" that consists of deep-fried butter served with ice cream infused with Irn-Bru soda and coulis. Some critics in Edinburgh have referred to deep-fried butter as a \"coronary on a plate\", but chefs at the pub have stated that when consumed in moderation it \"should be all right\". The pub also planned on offering a variation using whisky in place of Irn-Bru.\n\nDeep-fried butter's flavor has been compared to that of French toast, and has also been described as tasting like \"the most buttery bread you've ever had.\" It has been stated that the butter mostly melts into the mix when it is cooked. It may be prepared using whipped butter, which is less dense compared to standard butter. When consumed, stray liquefied butter inside the product may ooze from the product onto one's face and fingers.\n\nThe food has been described by ABC News as an \"artery-clogging snack.\"\n\nIn the United States, celebrity chef Paula Deen has published a recipe for fried butter balls. The recipe uses a blend of cream cheese and butter that is frozen, coated, frozen again, and then deep-fried. The cooking time in this recipe is short, for only ten to fifteen seconds, whereupon the product attains a \"light golden\" color.\n\nFried butter is a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was documented in the cookbook \"The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy\" in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie (\"spit it\"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs.

They are defined as neither exclusively mestizo (Indigenous American-European descent), nor mulatto (West African-European descent), nor zambo (Indigenous American-West African descent).\n\nIn Brazil, the word \"pardo\" has had a general meaning, since the beginning of the colonization. In the famous letter by Pero Vaz de Caminha, for example, in which Brazil was first described by the Portuguese, the Indigenous Americans were called \"pardo\": \"Pardo, naked, without clothing\". The word has ever since been used to cover African/European mixes, South Asian/European mixes, Amerindian/European/South Asian/African mixes and Indigenous Americans themselves.\n\nFor example, Diogo de Vasconcelos, a widely known historian from Minas Gerais, mentions the story of Andresa de Castilhos. According to 18th-century accounts, Andresa de Castilhos was described by the following: \"I declare that Andresa de Castilhos, parda woman ... has been freed ... is a descendant of the native gentiles of the land ... I declare that Andresa de Castilhos is the daughter of a white man and a (Christian) neophyte (Indigenous) woman\".\n\nThe historian Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende says that the word pardo was used to classify people with partial or full Amerindian ancestry. A Manoel, natural son of Ana carijó, was baptised as 'pardo'; in Campanha several Indigenous Americans were classified as 'pardo'; the Amerindian João Ferreira, Joana Rodriges and Andreza Pedrosa, for example, were described as 'freed pardo'; a Damaso identifies as a 'freed pardo' of the 'native of the land'; etc. According to Chaves de Resende, the growth of the pardo population in Brazil includes the descendants of Amerindian and not only those of African descent: \"the growth of the 'pardo' segment had not only to do with the descendants of Africans, but also with the descendants of the Amerindian, in particular the carijós and bastards, included in the condition of 'pardo'\".\n\nThe American historian Muriel Nazzari in 2001 noted that the \"pardo\" category has absorbed those persons of Amerindian descent in the records of São Paulo: \"This paper seeks to demonstrate that, though many Indians and mestizos did migrate, those who remained in São Paulo came to be classified as pardos.\"\n\nMost pardos within Hispanic America historically inhabited the territories where the Spanish conquistadors imported slaves during colonial times, such as the Captaincies of Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Venezuela, as well as the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.\n\nIn Peru, Pardos (or Afro-Mestizo), are referred to the mixture of Spanish and Amerindian with a little afro contribution, located exclusively along the whole coast, in greater proportion between the regions of Tumbes to Ica.\n\nIn Brazil, ' is a race/skin color category used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in Brazilian censuses, with historic roots in the colonial period. The term \"'\" is more commonly used to refer to mixed-race Brazilians, individuals with varied racial ancestries. The other categories are ' (\"White\"), ' (\"Black\"), ' (\"yellow\", meaning East Asians), and ' (\"indigene\" or \"indigenous person\", meaning Amerindians).\n\nThe term is still popular in Brazil. According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), ' is a broad classification that encompasses Multiracial Brazilians such as ' and ', as well as assimilated Amerindians known as ', mixed with Europeans or not. The term ' was first used in a Brazilian census in 1872. The following census, in 1890, replaced the word ' by \"\" (that of mixed origins). The censuses of 1900 and 1920 did not ask about race, arguing that \"the answers largely hid the truth\".\n"}

The ice cream is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and can be flavored with other ingredients, such as green tea, thai tea, etc. The boba (or tapioca pearls) is made out of tapioca starch, becoming gelatinous when cooked. It is a combination of both creaminess from the ice cream and chewiness from the boba. The bars should be kept frozen and defrosted a little before eating.\n\nBoba ice cream bars consist of ice cream and boba. A mixture of whole milk, heavy whipping cream, sugar, vanilla, and any additional flavors are mixed in a bowl until the mixture is homogeneous. Once homogeneous, the mixture is poured into an ice cream maker. Our boba consists of tapioca starch, sweet rice flour (mochiko), brown sugar, and water. The dough is rolled into tiny spheres. The spheres are cooked in boiling water. When done, it is cooled in an ice bath so that they don't stick together. The boba is then mixed in with the ice cream. The boba and ice cream mixture is then put into popsicle molds and put into the freezer until the popsicles are hardened.\n\nIt should be noted that tapioca starch, a main ingredient in creating boba, are made from cassava root. If prepared incorrectly, cassava root can be highly toxic as it naturally contains linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside, which upon ingestion will release cyanide in the gut. Prolonged ingestion can result in acute cyanide poisoning, a goiter, spastic paraparesis, or ataxic neuropathy.\n\nIf eggs were used in making the ice cream, there is risk for \"Salmonella\" infection if the egg base was not cooked to a proper temperature.

Although originating in Thailand, it is consumed throughout the Indochina region and the rest of Southeast Asia, including Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam and in Bangladesh. Mango sticky rice is usually eaten in the peak mango season, the summer months of April and May in Thailand. The notable mango sticky rice shops in Bangkok such as the Wong Wian Yi Sip Song Karakadakhom neighborhood in Pom Prap Sattru Phai near Hua Lamphong, which will only sell for 4 months per year (February to June), and at the Samphrang neighborhood in Phra Nakhon near Giant Swing and Chao Por Suea Joss House, with the Ban Mo near Si Kak Phraya Si Intersection and Pak Khlong Talat etc. \n\nThe main ingredients needed are sticky rice (glutinous rice), canned or fresh coconut milk, salt, palm sugar and mangoes.\nTo prepare the dish, the rice is soaked in water and then cooked by steaming or the use of a rice cooker. Meanwhile, the coconut milk is mixed with salt and sugar, and heated without boiling. After the rice is finished cooking, the coconut milk mixture and the rice are mixed together evenly and allowed to sit to allow the milk to absorb into the rice. The mangos are peeled and sliced. To serve the dish, the rice is scooped onto a plate, a few mango slices are placed on top or to the side, and the remaining coconut milk is drizzled on top. Sometimes the sticky rice is topped with crispy yellow mung beans. \n\nMostly, yellow mango is used which has a sweeter taste than green mango. Traditionally, the Nam Doc Mai (flower nectar mango) and ok-rong varieties of mango are used. Red/orange mangoes from Mexico & the Caribbean can also be used. Glutinous sticky rice, which is sweeter than the normal sticky rice, is used for the best texture. \n\nAs with many rice-based desserts, it is best to eat mango sticky rice directly after it is purchased or cooked because when refrigerated, the glutinous sticky rice turns hard and the coconut milk expires quickly. \n\nThese are some variations to the classic mango sticky rice: \n\nSticky rice is also commonly used in many sorts of Thai desserts like Khao mak and Khao tom. \n"}

They are usually filled with shrimp and pork belly, often being topped with fried shallots and served with sweet chili fish sauce. It is said to have originated from Huế, as the city was once the imperial capital of the Nguyễn dynasty and known for having simple, yet sophisticated dishes.\n\nThe dish's name is believed to have come from its clear, dumpling-like appearance, as the term \"bánh bột lọc\" loosely translates to \"clear flour cake.\" In Vietnamese, the word \"bánh\" can mean \"cake\" or \"bread,\" but can also be used as a general term for foods that are made from any type of flour, the most common being rice or tapioca. \"Bột\" literally means flour, although it does not specify the type, and \"lọc\" means \"refine\" or \"clarify.\"\n\nBánh bột lọc can either be steamed or boiled and wrapped with or without banana leaf. With the banana leaf wrapping, it is called \"bánh bột lọc lá\", meaning \"clear flour cake with leaf.\" Without the banana leaf wrapping, it is called \"bánh bột lọc trần\", meaning \"clear flour cake bare.\" The filling is traditionally a whole grilled shrimp with the shell on and a slice of pork belly, but variations have had the filling be shrimp without the shell, no pork belly, ground pork, mushrooms, and onions. In addition to tapioca flour, corn starch and rice flour have also been known to be added in the making the translucent wrapper.\n\nBánh bột lọc trần is made by adding boiling water with tapioca starch, then mixing and kneading until a smooth, soft, and elastic dough is formed. The dough is then divided into small balls and flattened, where the filling is placed in the middle. The dough gets folded over the filling and the edges pinched together to seal the filling in and creating a dumpling shape. The dumplings are cooked in boiling water, then drained and rinsed with cold water. Making bánh bột lọc lá is similar to making bánh bột lọc trần. The dough is placed in blanched banana leaves, some filling is added in the center, and then some more dough is placed on top to cover the filling. The banana leaves are then wrapped tightly and tied together with small strands of banana leaf before being steamed. Regardless of the method, the dish can be frozen for later use.\n\nTapioca starch is made from cassava root. If prepared incorrectly, cassava root can be highly toxic as it naturally contains linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside, which upon ingestion will release cyanide in the gut. Prolonged ingestion can result in acute cyanide poisoning, a goiter, spastic paraparesis, or ataxic neuropathy.\n\n\n"}

Infinium Spirits is the exclusive U.S. importer of Kerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the Irish Dairy Board approached the design agency Dynamo to develop and promote a cream liquor using their products. The product was intended to capitalize on Kerrygold's brand as a dairy producer and to compete with the popular Bailey's Irish Cream. The lifting of milk export quotas in Ireland also gave the company strong incentive to expand the international market for its dairy products.\n\nIn September 2014, the product launched in the United States in Florida and Illinois.\n\nKerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur was created by Kerrygold in Ireland, under Ornua – the Home of Irish Dairy which is a Co-op owned by Ireland’s dairy processors, and in turn by Ireland’s dairy farmers. In April 2015, milk quotas were lifted in Europe. Ornua was looking for more ways to export larger quantities of milk. The launching of the cream liqueur was one of the outcomes. Currently, the product is sold solely in the US, Dublin Airport and O'Briens Off Licence, in Douglas, Cork \n\nThe alcohol, chocolate, and cream from grass-fed cows, together with Irish whiskey from various distilleries, are homogenized to form an emulsion with the aid of an emulsifier, casein. This process prevents separation of the alcohol and cream during storage for up to 24 months. Without the homogenization, the fat from the cream rises to the top of the product. The quantity of other ingredients is not disclosed but they include herbs, sugar, and caramel.\n\nKerrygold Irish Cream Liqueurs shelf life is 2 years, stored in a refrigerator or not, but should be consumed within 6 months of opening. The product should be stored away from direct sunlight at temperatures between 0 and 25 °C (32 and 77 °F).\n\nLike other Irish creams, the cream will curdle whenever it comes into contact with a weak acid. Milk and cream contain casein, which coagulates, when mixed with weak acids such as lemon, tonic water, or traces of wine. While this outcome is undesirable in most situations, some cocktails specifically encourage coagulation.\n\n\nKerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur is the winner of the 2016 World Drink Awards \"World's Best Cream Liqueur Award\".\n\n\n"}

As a result, it is known by many names; such as tumis kangkung or cah kangkung in Indonesia, kangkong goreng in Malaysia, rau muống xào in Vietnam, stir fry kong xin cai (空心菜), stir fry tung choy or ong choy (通菜) in China, kankun mallung in Sri Lanka and kolmi shak bhaja in Bangladesh and eastern India.\n\nStir fried water spinach is one of the simplest, easiest, and also cheapest vegetable dishes in Asia, which contributes to its popularity. Water spinach thrives in the waterways, rivers, lakes and swamps of tropical Southeast Asia and Southern China. The garlic and shallots or onion are stir-fried in cooking oil, then the cleaned and cut water spinach are added, stir-fried in a wok on a strong fire with a small amount of cooking oil. The stir-frying lightly caramelizes the vegetables. The seasoning sauce is added according to each preference and recipe. Some might add slices of red hot chili pepper for spicy tanginess, while fresh or dried shrimp might be added for flavour. Other recipes might add diced tofu.\n\nThe stir-fried water spinach might vary according to its seasonings. A stir-fried water spinach could be lightly seasoned in garlic, black pepper, fish sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, or in spicy chili pepper, \"tauco\" (fermented soybean paste), shrimp paste or other sauce. The Vietnamese version seems to favour fish sauce for seasoning, while the Indonesian and Malaysian version seems to favour shrimp paste. The Filipino version often uses a soy sauce-vinegar seasoning mix, similar to the sauce base of the famous adobo dish. The Southern Chinese recipe might favour oyster sauce or fermented tofu (腐乳) seasoning. In West Java, the Chinese Indonesian version however, favours the use of \"tauco\" fermented soybeans paste as seasoning.\n\nA specific stir-fried water spinach seasoned with shrimp paste (\"belacan\" or \"terasi\") is called kangkung belacan, kangkong belacan or cah kangkung terasi. In Malay \"kangkong belacan\" means water spinach in shrimp paste seasoning. It is a popular vegetable dish in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.\n\n\n"}

Generally made from tapioca flour, its name comes from the cooking process, in which it is grilled between iron molds like a waffle. The snack comes in a variety of shapes and flavors. Though it is a popular souvenir among visitors to Cirebon, residents of the region rarely eat it.\n\nOne recipe for kue gapit from the Indonesian magazine \"Femina\" calls for wheat and rice flour, chicken eggs, coconut water, salt, sugar, and cinnamon. The egg is first beaten, then the cinnamon and sugar is mixed in. Once it has been absorbed by the mixture, the flour and salt is added, and this concoction is mixed further. After adding the coconut water, a tablespoon of the mixture is added to iron molds and grilled between them until cooked. This is repeated until the mixture is used up. The resulting kue are then stored for later consumption. Generally, however, tapioca is used rather than this mix of flours. The kue can be eaten on its own, or as a side dish.\n\nNumerous flavors are available, including chocolate, sesame seed, cheese, ginger, prawn, and \"balado\" (spicy). Additional flavorings are added during the mixing process. The molds come in a variety of shapes and sizes, though those with waffle-like square patterns are common; molds with space for more than one kue are available.\n\nThe name \"gapit\" comes from the cooking process, in which the kue are cooked between iron molds; this is known as \"mengapit\" in Indonesian. Kue gapit can be differentiated from semprong and simping, which are prepared in a similar fashion, by its size. Whereas simping, which originates from Purwakarta, is large and thin, gapit is smaller and thicker.\n\nThe cakes are traditional in the Cirebon area of West Java. Other snacks from the region include lantak, ladu, doplak, klitik, and intip gunung jati. Kue gapit is frequently purchased as a souvenir (\"oleh-oleh\"), and production is a common source of income in the region. In the lead up to Lebaran, sales are known to double. However, the local residents of Cirebon rarely eat the kue; the \"Cirebon Post\" attributes this to a lack of knowledge of the food's heritage value and the ready availability of factory-produced snacks.\n\n"}

The company began by selling their salami exclusively at farmers' markets and in their restaurant. After receiving nationwide recognition they had to expand their production facility to meet their demand. In April 2011, Olympia Provisions opened a second restaurant alongside a 4,000 square foot production facility. Two years later, Olympia Provisions had outgrown its production facility once again, and in February 2014 production moved 34,000 square foot production center two blocks from the Southeast restaurant.

{"id": "47126398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47126398", "title": "Kindleinwiegen", "text": "Kindleinwiegen\n\nKindleinwiegen (Rocking the Christchild) is a Christian Nativity tradition which can be traced back to the Liturgical dramas of the later Medieval period. It is a tradition primarily from the German speaking parts of central Europe which appeared across the region in a variety of forms, chiefly though not exclusively in monasteries and churches. It was at its most widespread between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, and survived more strongly in Roman Catholic regions than in those areas that switched to protestantism, following the interventions of Martin Luther and others.\n\nGerman language terms used for the celebration include Christkindlwiegen: the verb included in that compound word, \"\"wiegen\"\", indicates both rocking/cradling and weighing/getting the measure of the baby.\n\nThe celebration involved a form of congregational dancing accompanied by singing around a picture of Jesus placed on a crib or adjacent altar. The performance was led by the priests, and the singing, at least initially, appears to have consisted of duet sung by two priests.\n\nThe first surviving record of a \"\"Kindelwiegenfeier\"\" appears in \"De investigatione Antichristi\", produced in 1161/62 by Gerhoh, the Provost of the Augustinian Cannons at the Monastery of Reichersberg in Upper Austria. According to Gerhoh's description, the location of the ceremony was a monastery church and the participants were monks or \"secular\" clerics. The ceremony comprised the singing of several songs, from the book of hours and other unspecified liturgical sources, enriched with various drama-actions by the participants. In later centuries a wider level of congregation participation became the norm.\n\nBy the fifteenth century the custom had spread to practically all the churches in Germany. During the sixteenth century it began to be rejected by the more hardline protestant congregations, however, which increasingly rejected the \"Child Rocking\" ceremony as one of the fruits of (\"papist\") superstition. Nevertheless, even in regions touched by the Protestant Reformation it took a long time for \"Christkindlwiegen\" to disappear entirely.\n\nBach biographer Philipp Spitta describes the customs regarding the Kindleinwiegen in Protestant Leipzig before and after the City Council formally abolished the practice in 1702. He starts with a comment on a hymn in German that also uses some Latin words (Virga Jesse floruit, as used by the Leipzig composers Kuhnau and Bach for their Christmas compositions):\n\nThere was throughout the centuries considerable variation concerning the details of the ceremony. Even in regions that remained staunchly catholic, as the Counter reformation took hold there was a reaction against some of the Medieval jollity of the earlier celebrations, and the image of Jesus tended to be removed from the crib and placed instead on the altar, which was felt to be more respectful.\n\nThere was also increasingly use of \"props\" such as a Santa Claus doll to supervise proceedings. In another version, each of the young girls from the village dressed up and brought to church their own wax doll of the Baby Jesus. This provides a link to the Christmas nativity scene centred on the crib that became popular in the nineteenth century and remains a focus of Christmas decoration in many churches today. Another surviving link from the \"Christkindlwiegen\" custom is the Christmas song , still popular in German speaking areas, and believed to have originated as one of the songs that would have accompanied the old ceremony.\n\nAlthough the Christkindlwiegen had generally fallen out of use by the start of the twentieth century, there have been revivals. On January 7, 2012 the Viennese Medieval music expert Eberhard Kummer marked the 850th anniversary of the ceremony's first surviving recorded mention with a revival performance in St Gertrude's Church at Klosterneuburg, a short distance upstream of Vienna. Proceedings involved two altar girls rocking the \"Christchild\" in his crib, to the accompaniment of authentic dancing. The ceremony took place again at Klosterneuburg in January 2013 and January 2014.\n\n"}

It is one of the most common alternative spreads on a Reuben sandwich if one is not using Russian dressing.\n\nIt also typically contains finely chopped ingredients, which can include pickles, onions, bell peppers, green olives, hard-boiled egg, parsley, pimento, chives, garlic, or chopped nuts (such as walnuts or chestnuts).\n\nAccording to \"The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink\", the dressing's name comes from the Thousand Islands region, located along the upper St. Lawrence River between the United States and Canada. Within that region, one common version of the dressing's origins says that a fishing guide's wife, Sophia LaLonde, made the condiment as part of her husband George's shore dinner. Often in this version, actress May Irwin requested the recipe after enjoying it. Irwin, in turn, gave it to another. In another, second version of the story, Thousand Islands summer resident, George Boldt, who built Boldt Castle between 1900 and 1904 and who was proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, instructed the hotel's \"maître d'hôtel\", Oscar Tschirky, to put the dressing on the menu in 1894 after he forgot dressing on salads and improvised with what ingredients were on hand at the time. A 1959 \"National Geographic\" article states, \"Thousand Island Dressing was reportedly developed by Boldt's chef.\" Despite claims that he was involved in the introduction of the salad dressing at the Waldorf, chef Tschirky did not mention the salad dressing in his cookbook that was published during that time period.\n\nWhen University of Wisconsin sociologist Michael Bell and his graduate students attempted to determine the origin of Thousand Island dressing in 2010, they found that the story differed among villages and islands in the Thousand Islands region. They discovered the existence of a third origin story in which the original recipe was based upon French dressing, which is supported by a recipe published in the 11th edition of \"The Fannie Farmer Cookbook\" (1965). All the claims appeared to be based upon oral traditions without supporting written records.\n\nAccording to \"Food & Wine\" magazine, the dressing was a traditional sauce from the late 19th century in the Thousand Islands region. The wealthy who visited the region carried bottles of the local sauce back to New York City, such as one variant found in Clayton, New York called Sophia's Sauce found at a local hotel, \"Herald Hotel\" run by innkeeper Sophia Lelonde.\n\nSome food writers advance the claim that the dressing was invented by chef Theo Rooms of the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago during the same time period. The food historians at the \"Food Timeline\" point out that the earliest print references to Thousand Island dressing appear in 1912, and that recipes for different versions of the dressing begin to appear afterwards throughout the U.S.\n\nIt is widely used in fast-food restaurants and diners in the United States, where it is often referred to as \"special sauce\" or \"secret sauce\". An example of this is In-N-Out Burger's \"spread\", served on burgers and several \"secret menu\" items; despite its name, it is a variation of Thousand Island dressing. Thousand Island dressing is often used in a Reuben sandwich in lieu of Russian dressing. McDonald's Big Mac sauce is a variation on Thousand Island dressing.\n\nRhode Island dressing (\"Rhode islandsås\"), introduced by the Swedish restaurateur Tore Wretman, is similar to Thousand Island and very popular in Sweden. Its name is confusing, especially for foreigners, and its origin unclear, since the dressing has no relationship to Rhode Island and the name is not used for similar preparations outside Sweden.\n\nIn Germany, a similar salad dressing is called \"American dressing\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47270265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47270265", "title": "Vegan cheese", "text": "Vegan cheese\n\nVegan cheese is a non-dairy or plant cheese analogue aimed at vegans and other people who want to avoid animal products, including those who are lactose-intolerant. As with plant milk, vegan cheese can be made from seeds, such as sesame and sunflower; nuts, such as cashew, pine nut, and almond; and soybeans, peanuts, coconut oil, nutritional yeast, tapioca, and rice, among other ingredients. Vegan cheese is cholesterol-free and may be a good source of soy protein.\n\nNon-dairy cheese became commercially available in the 1980s, but at that time and into the 1990s, the vegan cheeses available weren’t as good quality as regular cheese, having a waxy, chalky or plasticky texture. From the early 1990s, a high-quality vegan cheese called Sheese has been available in Scotland and is distributed worldwide. In the United States, the only brand of vegan cheese available at the time was Soymage. Since then, the variety and taste of vegan cheese have improved significantly.\n\nAs of 2018, the current market for vegan cheese continues to grow and develop on a global scale. This is speculated to be due to the continuance of growing health concerns, dietary restrictions, and popularity in veganism. This market increase can be seen directly in regions within the United States and Canada. The growth can also be seen reaching all the way to market economies across the world in places such as China, Japan, Australia, Germany, France, and Brazil. The more popular types of vegan cheese being manufactured, distributed, and produced through this market are those mimicking Mozzarella, Parmesan, Cheddar, and Cream Cheese dairy based cheeses. These vegan cheeses are most popularly being applied to the general area of food itself, be it via restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, or personal cultivation. Vegan cheese is expanding and projected to continue to grow greatly into the mid 2020s.\n\nIn February 2019, a Vancouver, British Columbia vegan cheese shop, Blue Heron Creamery, was ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to stop calling their products cheese as it was 'misleading' to consumers, despite the Creamery stating that their cheese was always labelled as \"dairy-free\" and \"plant-based.\" The CFIA later reversed the rejection and stated that they have no objection to the Creamery using the nomenclature “100% dairy-free plant-based cheese” provided that \"it is truthful\".\n\nIn the same month, a Brixton vegan cheese shop, La Fauxmagerie, was ordered by Dairy UK to stop describing products as cheese because it 'misleads shoppers'. Sisters Rachel and Charlotte Stevens, owners of the cheese shop, stated that it is not misleading as their \"products were clearly marked as dairy-free.\"\n\nSome of the success in the vegan cheese market can be attributed to the continuing development of plant based proteins in substitution for cow’s milk among dairy products. Plant based proteins or vegetable proteins are derived from edible sources of protein such as soybeans. These proteins are used to help mimic texture and overall structure of the food product they are attempting to replicate in a non-dairy version. Plant based proteins are partly responsible for vegan cheeses being able to imitate the stretching and melting property that dairy cheeses possess.\n\nA difficult challenge for food scientists is creating vegan cheese that melts and stretches like real cheese. Dairy cheese, and many lactose-free cheese analogues, melt and stretch because of the protein casein, which is a milk protein and therefore not vegan, so food scientists use a \"blend of gums, protein, solids and fats\" to attempt to duplicate the mouthfeel and melt of real cheese. A project called Real Vegan Cheese aims to solve this difficulty by making cheese with casein produced by yeast rather than by cows. This cheese would have real casein, but would be vegan because the casein would not be animal-derived.\n\nAs of 2018, there are a few different approaches to making vegan cheese, but one of the more intricate and scientific processes involves fermentation. In this approach the “cheese” maker would typically start with some type of tree nut and allow the desired amount of nuts to soak in a small amount of water for about 36 hours. The soaking of the raw nuts allows bacteria to develop and then ferment. The natural sugars produced by the tree nut and the bacterial development are how the fermentation happens. The length of time involved in the before mentioned fermentation is what gives vegan cheese its variance in tangy flavor.\n"}

A similar soup, called \"zanzarelli\", was described by Martino da Como in his 15th century manual, \"The Art of Cooking\". Other variants exist.\n\nTraditionally \"stracciatella alla romana\" used to be served at the start of Easter lunches. \"Stracciatella alla romana\" is traditionally prepared by beating eggs and mixing in grated parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon zest, and sometimes semolina; this mixture is then gently drizzled into boiling meat broth, while stirring so as to produce little shreds (\"\"stracciatelle\"\") of cooked egg in the soup. The resulting soup can be served in bowls containing a few thin slices of toasted bread, with additional parmesan grated on top.\n\nAccording to Ada Boni, \"stracciatella alla romana\" used also to be scented with marjoram. Other traditional Italian and Italian-American recipes suggest garnishing with chopped parsley. Some American variations of the soup incorporate spinach as a main ingredient.\n\nA recipe for a spicy soup made with eggs and broth that bears similarities to the modern-day stracciatella was recorded as early as the 15th century by Martino da Como in his \"Libro de Arte Coquinaria\" (\"The Art of Cooking\") under the name of \"zanzarelli\". The traditional preparation of stracciatella is also rather similar to that of \"sciusceddu\", a rich festive soup from Messina in Sicily that may be a cousin of the Roman dish.\n\nStracciatella soup inspired the gelato (Italian ice-cream) flavour of the same name, which was created in 1962 by a restaurateur in the northern town of Bergamo, who claimed he had grown tired of stirring eggs into broth to satisfy customers from Rome.\n\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

It is one of the most renowned Italian gelato flavours.\n\nMakers produce the effect by drizzling melted chocolate into plain milk ice cream towards the end of the churning process; chocolate solidifies immediately coming in contact with the cold ice cream, and is then broken up and incorporated into the ice cream with a spatula. This process creates the shreds of chocolate that give stracciatella its name. (\"Straciatella\" in Italian means \"little shred\".) While straciatella ice cream traditionally involves milk ice cream and milk chocolate, modern variations can also be made with vanilla and dark chocolate.\nEnrico Panattoni, the owner of \"La Marianna\", a gelateria in Bergamo in northern Italy, invented the dish in 1961.\nAccording to Panattoni, the idea came to him after he had grown tired of stirring eggs into broth to satisfy customers of his restaurant who kept asking for stracciatella soup.\n\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n"}

A recipe for a John Collins is featured in the \"Steward and Barkeeper's Manual\" of 1869:\n\n<poem>Teaspoonful of powdered sugar\nThe juice of half a lemon\nA wine glass of Old Tom Gin\nA bottle of plain soda\nShake up, or stir up with ice.

It is the primary and most popular alcoholic beverage in India's villages and for the below poverty line class in urban and city areas. It is fermented and distilled from molasses which is a by product of sugarcane. Desi liquor is a broad term and it can include both legally and illegally made local alcohol. The term \"desi daru\" usually refers to legal alcohol while other types of desi liquor (arrack and palm toddy) may be categorised as Moonshine alcohol. It is consumed in India from ancient times and is known by different names in different parts of the country.\n\nThe term \"desi\", from Hindi language term \"desh\" (country or region), which is generally an endonym for the \"compatriot\" or \"local\" is often applied to food or drink that is considered traditional or native. \"Daaru\" is an indigenous term used for any alcoholic beverage in India. \"Sharaab\" is the Persian-derived equivalent and is used in some areas with less frequency.\n\nAn article in the medical journal \"The Lancet\" estimated that nearly two-thirds of the alcohol consumed in India is desi daru (IMCL - Indian Made commercial Liquor). \"Globus spirits\" mentioned that India's desi liquor market is about 242 million cases (over 30% of the beverage industry in India) with a growth rate of about 7% per annum.

If care is not taken in the distillation process and the proper equipment is not used, harmful impurities such as fusel alcohols, lead from plumbing solder, and methanol can be concentrated to toxic levels. Several deaths have been reported in India and Pakistan due to consumption of non-factory made toxic liquor.\n\nThere are several references of desi daru in Bollywood films, songs.\n\n\n"}

It was first invented in Shunde, Guangdong. It is a velvety smooth milk custard somewhat resembling panna cotta, with two skins. The first skin is formed during cooling of the boiled milk and the second when cooling the cooked custard. Traditionally buffalo milk is used; its higher fat content compared to cow's milk produces a smooth texture. This dessert is particularly famous in Shunde, Guangzhou, Macau, and Hong Kong.\n\nDouble skin milk originates from the Daliang Town, Shunde District in Guangdong. It is said to have been created by Grandma Dong in 1850 in Shunde.\nCowherd Grandma Dong (Xiaohua Dong) wished to store unsold milk. In one experiment she boiled the milk and found a skin formed on the milk after cooling it down. The skin was surprisingly delicious. After several improvements we have today's double skin milk, with Grandma Dong credited as the originator. Nowadays, the skills used in making double skin milk are listed as part of the Shunde Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\n"}

The company produces and markets three Single Malt Whiskey Del Bac labels. Its current distillery facility, called Mash & Chisel, is located in west Tucson, Arizona. Hamilton is the first craft distillery established in Southern Arizona since prohibition and the largest Whiskey producer in the Tucson metro region.\n\nHamilton Distillers concept was developed by american wood worker Stephen Paul and his daughter Amanda Paul in 2006. In the mid 1980s the Paul's opened a boutique furniture company Arroyo Design producing custom luxury mesquite wood fine furniture for international clients. The Hamilton Distillers product grew out of the use of mesquite and was developed to capture the unique taste of this arid climate tree and the Sonoran desert. Whiskey Del Bac is rooted in a historical tradition of wine and spirit production in the American Southwest that grew out of imported european grapevines brought by Franciscan missionaries in 1500s, the arrival of Whiskey into the American West through companies like the American Fur Company, and the enigmatic golden age of Arizona’s wild west cowboys and gunslingers. Each of the three inaugural Hamilton Whiskey products share the name Del Bac with the Spanish Colonial Mission San Xavier del Bac founded in 1692 by Padre Eusebio Kino, outside of current day Tucson. Del Bac is the physical location near Tucson. In 2015 Hamilton Distillers was named by Playboy Magazine as Arizona's best spirit.\n\nThe Master Distillers of Hamilton since its founding have been Paul joined in 2013 by Nathan Thompson-Avolino.\n\nHamilton is a single malt straight whiskey, aged in new charred oak barrels, like bourbon. Unlike traditional whiskey, the Sonoran desert product is malted over mesquite instead of peat. The process imbues the whiskey with a sweet tobacco and dark chocolate nose and is underpinned by sandalwood and creates a soft tannins on the palette with desert campfire and spice notes.\n\nEach barrel is bottled by hand, with each label hand-signed by the distiller. The bottling process is done by volunteers, who receive a free bottle of Whiskey Del Bac. Requests to volunteer must be sent in writing to the distillery. The bottle features hand letterpress label printed on a Chandler & Price press with gold foil and features a 19th century etching of a giant saguaro cactus.\n\n\n\n"}

In the original release by the LADWP, there is no mention of water conservation as an objective, and the project was planned for a five year life span, until a Griffith Park project was completed.

The balls saved 1.7 million cubic metres of water from evaporating during their deployment from August 2015 to March 2017.

Eventually the process spread across the region and was perfected by using wool sheets to filter the brine.

They were worked as a series of horizontal levels or \"lefals\", served by small gauge railways, hauled by men, horses or locomotives. These levels were linked by a series of inclined planes. The inclines were worked by gravity: slate was quarried from the upper levels and descended the inclines on small rail wagons under its own weight. Slate was worked on the middle levels of the quarry, sawn into slabs or split into roofing slates. Waste could be dumped from these levels to form large waste tips. Finished or part-finished slates were then lowered to the lowest level by a further incline and then taken to market by a narrow gauge railway.\n\nSome larger quarries were worked by quarrymen who lived in barracks on site during the week, others lived in villages below the quarry and travelled each day. Part of this journey was to ascend the inclines each morning, usually hauled up in empty wagons. Descending after work was a long, although downhill, walk.\nAt Graig Ddu Quarry near Blaenau Ffestiniog, quarrymen living in Manod found a way to speed their homeward journey. Rather than walking back down the inclines, they would use their car gwyllt to ride down them.\n\nCraig Ddu had four inclines, with many workers in the sawing and dressing sheds below the upper incline. When the hooter of Oakeley Quarry sounded for the end of work at 4pm, there was a rush downhill to catch the bus from Bethania, along the valley to the other villages. The men could descend 1,000 feet, a distance of 1,800 yards including the walk between the two inclines, in around eight minutes.\n\nAfter arriving at the foot of the last incline, the cars would be dropped into an empty wagon which would be raised back up the inclines during the next working day.\n\nA further, lower, incline passed down through Bethania to the GWR slate loading sidings, although this was not part of the quarrymen's route home.\n\nAlthough quite widely known, the car gwyllt remained limited to the single quarry at Craig Ddu. This was due to the layout of the two main inclines: long enough to make the time-saving worthwhile, but also shallow enough to keep speed manageable and with a shallow run-out area at their foot.\n\nThis novel mode of transport became a matter of interest outside the quarries and in 1935 it formed part of Pathé News' newsreel film \"Railway Curiosities\".\n\nCraig Ddu continued in operation until the end of the 1930s and the outbreak of WWII. It re-opened briefly during the war, to supply roofing slates for the repair of blitzed housing.\n\nThe car gwyllt was invented around 1870 by the quarry blacksmith, Edward Ellis. In later years they were made by Edward Jones, an independent smith living on Manod Road, who charged 5 shillings. Each quarryman had their own car and so an early purchase with a new starter's \"tal mawr\" would be a new car gwyllt.\n\nThe inclines were cable-hauled with two tracks running over four rails, so there were a series of cable rollers down the middle of each track. The cars avoided these by running between the two tracks, using just their inner rails. Rather than the near-universal two foot gauge of Welsh slate railways, this spacing was around three foot.\n\nTheir construction was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode on a single double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on the rear of the plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand brake. Pulling upwards on this applied an iron brake to the tread of the wheel. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the cast wheel was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The brake linkage comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the main lever. It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.\n\nThe name \"car gwyllt\" has been applied to a small number of other Welsh rail vehicles. On the Padarn Railway, both the hand-cranked and foot cranked \"Velocipede\" cars used the name. On the Hendre-Ddu Tramway \"car gwyllt\" referred to small gravity carriages used by quarrymen. \n\nOn the Mount Washington Cog Railway, built from 1866, the construction workers made use of a sliding wooden device, the \"Devil's shingle\". The rack railway has a ruling grade of 25% and speeds of had been reached before a fatal accident in 1906 led to the slideboards being banned.\n\n"}

It is produced using the butter made from the milk of sheep, goats or a combination of the two. The butter is brought to boiling point for about 15 minutes, then skimmed, strained into a ceramic jar called a \"khabia\", and salted before it curdles. Thyme is often added to it to provide a yeast and enzyme starter. Other plants or fruits can be used. The result is then aged, often in sealed containers. It is then traditionally buried in the ground for temperature stability purposes, just like cheese is left to mature in caves because they have cooler and more stable temperatures.\n\nIt is similar to ghee and niter kibbeh, but has a characteristically strong, rancid, and cheesy taste and smell. Matured smen is very similar in taste to blue cheese because likewise it is a high-fat form of cheese. The older the smen, the stronger—and more valued—it becomes. Smen is traditionally used mainly in the preparation of couscous and trid, as well as of tagines and kdras, although it is becoming increasingly difficult to find due to its increasing replacement by peanut oil, a non-native culinary element introduced from Senegal and other West African countries.\n\nSmen made during winter is believed to be more fragrant than those made during a warmer season. In constant warm weather, closer to the temperature where butter becomes liquid, smen matures very slowly. In lower temperatures, one month is considered an acceptable time to start using the smen in cooking, although its flavour will not be strong. In a constant warm weather, like in equatorial countries, it can take up to four months to develop the equivalent amount of flavour.\n\nSmen holds great cultural significance, particularly as an indicator of familial wealth. As such it will often be used as a token of honor for esteemed visitors to a household, akin to other cultures' customs such as using the \"fine china\" or serving an especially prized wine.\n\nBerber farmers in southern Morocco will sometimes bury a sealed vessel of smen on the day of a daughter's birth, aging it until it is unearthed and used to season the food served on that daughter's wedding.\n\nIn Israel and Yemen, Jews prepare a special version of \"semneh\" (סאמנה) which is smoked with aromatic herbs inside of a gourd in order to impart deeper flavour and aid in preservation.\n\n"}

The dish is considered a national favourite in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nIt is made from flat rice noodles () or kway teow () of approximately 1 cm or (in the north of Malaysia) about 0.5 cm in width, stir-fried over very high heat with light and dark soy sauce, chilli, a small quantity of belachan, whole prawns, blood cockles without shells, bean sprouts ,chopped Chinese chives, slices of Chinese sausage, fishcake, beansprouts, and less commonly with other ingredients. \"Char kway teow\" is traditionally stir-fried in pork fat, with crisp croutons of pork lard. In Penang, Char kway teow is commonly served on a piece of banana leaf on a plate, so as to enhance the aroma on the noodles.\n\n\"Char kway teow\" has a reputation of being unhealthy due to its high saturated fat content. However, when the dish was first invented, it was mainly served to labourers. The high fat content and low cost of the dish made it attractive to these people as it was a cheap source of energy and nutrients. When the dish was first served, it was often sold by fishermen, farmers and cockle-gatherers who doubled as \"char kway teow\" hawkers in the evening to supplement their income.\n\nThe term \"\"char kway teow\"\" is a transliteration of the Chinese characters 炒粿條 (in simplified Chinese 炒粿条). The dish's name is Hokkien (\"chhá-kóe-tiâu\"), but the dish may have its roots in Chaozhou in China’s Guangdong province and is mostly associated with the Teochew. The word \"kóe-tiâu\" (literally meaning \"ricecake strips\") generally refers to flat rice noodles, which are the usual ingredient in West Malaysia and Singapore. In East Malaysia, on the other hand, actual sliced ricecake strips are used to make this dish.\n\nIn popular transliterations, there is no fixed way of spelling \"chhá-kóe-tiâu\", and many variants can be found: e.g., \"char kueh teow\", \"char kuey teow\", \"char koay teow\", \"char kueh tiao\" etc.\n\nOwing to the dish's popularity and spread to Cantonese-speaking areas, the term \"\"char kway teow\"\" has been corrupted into \"炒貴刁\" (). The term \"\" has no real meaning, but its pronunciation in Cantonese and Mandarin is similar to \"粿條\" in Min Nan.\n\nIn Hong Kong, \"\"char kway teow\"\" is often known as \"Penang \"char kway teow\"\" (檳城炒粿條 or 檳城炒貴刁).\n\nAs the dish has become increasingly popular, many cooks have come up with their own interpretations of the same basic main ingredient of ricecake strips/flat rice noodles fried with anything from eggs (chicken or duck), onions, garlic, prawns, cockles, Chinese sausage, chives, etc.\n\nIn the past, it was usual to stir-fry \"char kway teow\" in pork fat without eggs (which were, however, available on request). More recently, ordinary cooking oil is commonly used for health or religious reasons, and eggs have become a standard ingredient in the dish.\n\nVersions of \"char kway teow\" prepared by Muslims in Malaysia will exclude pork fat and may include extra soy sauces and spices and the use of broader-width flat rice noodles. A popular version of \"char kway teow\" in Malaysia is also known as \"fried kway teow,\" where it is not as drenched in sauce as much as \"char kway teow\" is. There are also vegetarian varieties that may or may not include eggs.\n\nThere are also \"gourmet\" versions of \"char kway teow\", commonly found in Ipoh and Penang, where the dish may be prepared with more seafood, with crab meat and with duck eggs.\n\n\"Char kway teow\" is also popular at takeaways in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn Myanmar, a variety called the \"Beik Kut kyae kaik\" (the Beik Scissor Cut) exists. It is popular in the southern coastal regions around the town of Myeik (\"Baik\" is the Burmese pronunciation) and in Yangon, the largest city in the country. It uses more pepper and seafood compared to the \"kway teow\" of Singapore and Malaysia. The rice noodles are slightly thinner and are stir-fried with boiled yellow peas, bean sprouts, squid and prawns, spring onions and dark sweet soy sauce. After being stir-fried, the noodles are cut with scissors (\"kut kyae\" in Burmese), thus its name. In many Asian fusion restaurants in America, such as the popular Cafe Asia chain, this dish is offered under the name Gway Tiao.\n\nMany Southeast Asian restaurants in Hong Kong offer \"char kway teow\" as a Malay speciality although it is of Southeast Asian Chinese origin. The \"char kway teow\" served in Hong Kong is an entirely different dish: stir-fried Chinese-style flat rice noodles with prawns, \"char siu\", onions, and bean sprouts, seasoned with curry and bright yellow in colour. In some places this is known as \"Fried \"Good Dale\"\", a transliteration of the characters \"炒貴刁\".\n\nIn Indonesia, there is a similar dish known as \"kwetiau goreng\" () and is served in Chinese restaurants, street side tent \"warung\", and by traveling street hawkers' carts. This Indonesian version tastes mildly sweet with generous addition of \"kecap manis\" (sweet soy sauce), has spicier and stronger flavor with addition of sambal condiment, less oily, mostly halal which means uses no lard or pork, and normally incorporates beef or chicken to cater to the majority Indonesian Muslim population. However, some Chinese restaurants in Indonesia that mainly serve non-Muslim customers might use pork and pork fat.\n\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, a similar stir-fried noodle dish is called \"hủ tiếu xào\". Thai cuisine has its own version called \"phat si-io\".\n\nIn Singapore, the char kway teow is sometimes referred to as orr kway teow (orr meaning “dark” in Hokkien) and is a popular, inexpensive dish usually eaten for breakfast and sold at food stalls in Singapore. There are also healthier versions with more vegetables and less oil. Furthermore, the greens and bean sprouts give off a fresh, crunchy texture that makes the dish stand out even more from other dishes of the cuisine. There is also an incorporation of seafood (like prawns, cuttlefish, squid, lobster meat). This version is also common in Perth, Western Australia, which has a large expatriate Singaporean population.\n\n"}

Chicken and dumplings is a popular comfort food in the Midwestern and Southern U.S., where dumplings are often used as part of the regionally popular Burgoo stew.\n\nThe baked dumpling is popular in American cuisine. These sweet dumplings are made by wrapping fruit, frequently a whole tart apple, in pastry, then baking until the pastry is browned and the filling is tender. As an alternative to simply baking them, these dumplings are surrounded by a sweet sauce in the baking dish, and may be basted during cooking. Popular flavours for apple dumplings include brown sugar, caramel, or cinnamon sauces.\n\nBoiled dumplings are made from flour to form a dough. A pot of boiling chicken or turkey broth is used to cook this dough. The thickness and the size of the dumplings is at the cook's discretion. It is optional to serve with the meat in the dish or on the side.\n\nTortilla dumplings are made by adding tortillas and fillings to a boiling pot of stock. Popular varieties of Southern dumplings include chicken dumplings, turkey dumplings, strawberry dumplings, apple dumplings, ham dumplings, and even butter-bean dumplings.\n\nSteamed dumplings are found throughout the region.\n\nManti (also \"manty\" or \"mantu\") is a steamed dumpling in Central Asian and Chinese Islamic cuisine. It contains a mixture of ground lamb (or beef) spiced with black pepper, enclosed in a dough wrapper. Manti are cooked in a multi-level steamer (\"mantovarka\") and served topped with butter, yogurt, sour cream, or onion sauce. These dumplings are popular throughout Central Asia, including in Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Xinjiang region in China.\n\nChuchvara is a very small boiled dumpling typical of Uzbek and Tajik cuisine. Made of unleavened dough squares filled with meat, it is similar to the Russian pelmeni and the Chinese wonton, but in observance of the Islamic dietary rules, the meat filling is without pork. Chuchvara can be served in a clear soup or on their own, with vinegar or sauce based on finely chopped greens, tomatoes and hot peppers. Another popular way of serving chuchvara is topped with suzma (strained qatiq) or with smetana (sour cream), Russian-style.\n\nA legend goes that dumplings were first invented in the era of the Three Kingdoms, around 225 AD. Zhuge Liang, a general and minister of Shu Han, dammed up a poison marsh on his southern campaign against the Nanman with dumplings instead of the heads that the Nanman used. However, this legend is more commonly associated with the mantou (the name is supposedly evolved from \"蠻頭\", also pronounced as \"mantou\").\n\nThe \"jiǎozi\" () is a common Chinese dumpling, which generally consists of minced meat and finely chopped vegetables wrapped into a piece of dough skin. The skin can be either thin and elastic or thicker.There is even a statement that the skin of \"jiǎozi\" determines the quality of \"jiǎozi\". Popular meat fillings include ground meat (usually pork, but can instead be beef or chicken), shrimp, and even fish. Popular mixtures include pork with Chinese cabbage, pork with garlic chives, pork and shrimp with vegetables, pork with spring onion, garlic chives with scrambled eggs. Filling mixtures will vary depending on personal tastes, region and season. According to some region and harvest, seasonal ingredients can be included oyster. \"Jiaozi\" are usually boiled, steamed or fried and continue to be a traditional dish eaten, in which people will place a coin or candy inside the \"Jiaozi\" with the meanings of obtaining a fortune or having a sweet life, on Chinese New Year's Eve, the evening before Chinese New Year, and special family reunions. Particularly, in Northern China, people generally eat dumpling on the Winter Solstice (December 22 of each year), a custom signifying a warm winter. Extended family members may gather together to make dumplings, and it is also eaten for farewell to family members or friends. In Northern China, dumplings are commonly eaten with a dipping sauce made of vinegar and chili oil or paste, and occasionally with some soy sauce added in. However, \"baozi\" is \"not\" a type of \"jiaozi\".\nIf dumplings are laid flatly on a pan, first steamed with a lid on and with a thin layer of water, then fried in oil after the water has been evaporated, they are called \"guotie\" (鍋貼, literally translates to \"potstickers\"). The same dumplings are called \"jiaozi\" if they are just steamed or boiled.\n\nThe \"wonton\" (Cantonese name) or hún dun in Mandarin (雲呑/餛飩) is another kind of dumpling. The shape is similar to Italian tortellino. It is typically boiled in a light broth or soup and made with a meat or shrimp filling. The skin wrapping for wontons is different—thinner and less elastic—than that used for jiaozi . Wontons are more popular in Southern China (Shanghai, Guangdong, Hong Kong etc.), whereas in Northern China, jiaozi are more popular. Jiaozi, wonton and potstickers are each wrapped differently.\nAnother type of Chinese dumpling is made with glutinous rice. Usually, the glutinous rice dumplings, zongzi (粽子), are triangle or cone shaped, can be filled with red bean paste, Chinese dates or cured meat depending on region. Glutinous rice dumplings are traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival. Other types of dumplings would be \"soup dumplings\", commonly referred to as xiaolongbao (小籠包).\n\nChinese cuisine also include sweet dumplings. Tangyuan (湯圓) are smaller dumplings made with glutinous rice flour and filled with sweet sesame, peanut, red bean paste. Tangyuan may also be served without a filling. Tangyuan are eaten on the 15th day of Chinese New Year, or the Lantern Festival. In Southern China, people will also eat the sweet dumplings (tangyuan) with shape angle on the top, in the Winter Solstice meaning the harvest in the coming year.\n\nSee also: dim sum (點心) for descriptions of several other kinds of dumplings such as har gow, fun guo, siew mai, Cha siu bao, lo mai gai and crystal dumplings.\n\nIndian cuisine features several dishes which could be characterised as dumplings:\n\nIndonesian dumplings were influenced and brought by Chinese immigrants to Indonesia.\n\n\"Dango\" (団子) is a sweet dumpling made from rice flour, similar to mochi. Dango is eaten year-round, but the different varieties are traditionally eaten in given seasons. Three to four dango are often served on a skewer.\n\n\"Gyōza\" (ギョーザ/餃子) is the Japanese version of the Chinese \"jiaozi\".\n\n\"Nikuman\" (肉まん) is the Japanese variant of \"baozi\".\n\nKorean dumplings are called \"mandu\" (만두, 蠻頭). They are typically filled with a mixture of ingredients, including ground pork, kimchi, vegetables, cellophane noodles, but there are very many variations. Mandu can be steamed, fried, or boiled. The dumplings can also be used to make a soup called mandu-guk (만둣국).\n\n\nIn Nepal, steamed dumplings known as momos (or momo-cha) are a popular snack, often eaten as a full meal as well. They are similar to the Chinese jiaozi or the Central Asian manti. This dish is native to Nepal and the concept of the dumpling was brought to Nepal by the Newar traders of Kathmandu who were trading goods with Tibet before the 1930s. Many different fillings, both meat based and vegetarian are common. Kathmandu Valley, a popular destination for momos, has with time developed its own essence for this food that differentiates it from its Tibetan counterpart.\n\nMomos can be both fried and steamed. Momos are usually served with a dipping sauce normally consisting of tomatoes and chillies as the base ingredient, from which numerous variations can be made. Momo soup is a dish that has steamed momos immersed in a meat broth. Momos that are pan fried after steaming first are known as kothey momo, and steamed momos served in a hot sauce are called C-Momo in Nepal. Momos can also be prepared by directly deep frying without steaming first. Momos are one of the most items on the menus of Nepalese restaurants not only in Nepal but also around the world with significant Nepali populations like India, USA, UK, Australia and some Middle Eastern and European countries.\n\nYomari, also called Yamari, is a delicacy of the Newar community in Nepal. It is a steamed dumpling that consists of an external covering of rice flour and an inner content of sweet substances such as chaku. The delicacy plays a very important role in Newaa society, and is a key part of the festival of Yomari punhi. According to some, the triangular shape of the yamari is a symbolical representation of one half of the shadkona, the symbol of Saraswati and wisdom.\n\nEmpanadas, whose stuffing, manufacture and types are numerous and varied, differ from traditional dumplings in that they are deep fried or steamed, and excess dough is not cut off.\n\nIn Barbados, dumplings differ from those in other Caribbean islands in that they are slightly sweetened. The dumplings may either be of the flour or cornmeal variety. The dough is flavoured with spices, cinnamon and nutmeg. Dumplings are often added with Bajan soup where they are boiled. When found in Stew food, the dumplings are steamed along with ground provision, salted meat, plantain and other ingredients which is served with gravy.\n\nIn Brazil, there are :\n\n- pastéis, thin dough that is mainly stuffed with cheese and then fried,\n\n- empada, muffin-shaped dough stuffed primarily with chicken, cheese or seafood (this is NOT Empanadas).\n\n- \"coxinhas\", thick dough stuff with chicken (could be described as a chicken corn dog ), and\n\n- \"bolinhas\", which literally translates to 'little balls', can have meat(bolinhas de carne) or cheese(bolinhas de queijo) inside.\n\nAll dumplings can vary of its original form with optional additions like olives, onions or spices. They are commonly served in parties. In some parts of Brazil like Rio it can be found in fast-food kiosks('open restaurants', where there is no door to enter and you are served in a big counter) in the city or in parks, but it is very diffused through the territory, so you could find people who also eat these on the beach or after work with beer, fruity alcoholic drinks known as batidas, or non-alcoholic beverages like soda or refrescos(sort of juice).\n\nDumplings are either pan fried using a simple recipe including all-purpose flour, water, and salt made into a thick dough before frying on a pan until golden brown, or boiled in a soup. The fried version is usually served with breakfast codfish as a side.\n\nIn Chile, there are pantrucas, a type of flat, elongated irregular dumplings flavoured with fresh parsley and served in soup.\nIn Chiloé, a Chilean southern archipelago, one of the American regions potato is native from, traditional meal are \"chapalele\", \"milcao\", \"chochoca\", \"chuhuañe\" and \"vaeme\". All of them made potato based, cooked or raw and sometimes mixed in different proportions of wheat flour, seasoned with lard. Some are flat and round filled with greaves and fried (milcao); flat boiled (chapaleles, milcaos), similar but bigger to \"pantrucas or pancutras\" or a roasted roll in a stick (chochoca). Size is one portion and regularly served as bread. Also are served with honey (mainly hot chapaleles, as dessert).\nIn Chile also existing traditional \"papas rellenas\". Boiled potatoes and flour dough; meat,onion,some cumin filled and fried; served regularly with crystallized sugar over.\n\nDumplings come in three forms in Jamaica, fried, boiled, and roasted. All are made with flour, white or wheat, and the white-floured dumplings are often mixed with a bit of cornmeal. These foods are often served with a variety of dishes like ackee and saltfish, kidneys, liver salt mackerel, etc. and often taste better when refried. A refried dumpling is an already boiled dumpling left over from previous cooking that is fried, which gives it a slightly crispy outer layer and a tender middle. A purely fried white flour dumpling (also known as a \"Johnny Cake\") is golden brown and looks similar to a buñuelo, often substituting the boiled dumpling, but it is mostly consumed as part of breakfast. Fried dumplings can be made with or without sugar. When mixed with sugar, cornmeal and baking powder and fried, this variation is called festival. This delicious variation goes well when served with fried fish, or any other traditional Jamaican home food.\n\n\"Papas Rellenas\" or stuffed potatoes consist of a handful of mashed potatoes (without the milk and butter) flattened in the palm of the hand and stuffed with a savoury combination of ingredients. The stuffing usually consists of sautéed meat (could be beef, pork or chicken), onions and garlic. They are all seasoned with cumin, aji, raisins, peanuts, olives and sliced or chopped hard boiled eggs. After stuffing a ball is formed, rolled over flour and deep fried in hot oil. The stuffed potatoes are usually accompanied by onion sauce consisting of sliced onions, lime juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and slices of fresh peppers. The same dish may also be made with seafood. In some countries, yuca purée is used as the starch component of these Latin American dumplings.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, dumplings are made of grated tubers such as yuca and malanga with added calabaza, unripe bananas and plantains mixed with flour. These dumplings are a traditional part in Puerto Rican style pigeon pea soup. Olive oil and annatto are usually added and help the mix from turning brown. The dumplings are formed into small balls and are first cooked in olive oil before boiling. Once the dumplings are crispy on the outside, they are then boiled with added ingredients.\n\nAnother dumpling that originated in Puerto Rico is the pasteles, a dumpling made of grated root vegetables, squash, plantains, and unripe bananas. The masa is then mixed with milk and annatto oil, and they are stuffed with stewed pork, chick peas, olives, capers and raisins. They are then placed on a banana leaf, tied and then boiled. The origin of pasteles leads back to Natives on the island of Borikén. Pasteles are popular in the Dominican Republic, Hawaii, Trinidad and lately seen in Cuban cuisine.\n\nSavoury dumplings made from balls of dough are part of traditional British and Irish cuisine. Traditionally dumplings are made from twice the weight of self raising flour to suet, bound together by cold water to form a dough and seasoned with salt and pepper. Balls of this dough are dropped into a bubbling pot of stew or soup, or into a casserole. They sit, partly submerged in the stew, and expand as they are half-boiled half-steamed for ten minutes or so. The cooked dumplings are airy on the inside and moist on the outside. The dough may be flavoured with herbs, or it may have cheese pressed into its centre.\n\nThe Norfolk dumpling is not made with fat, but from flour and a raising agent. Cotswold dumplings call for the addition of breadcrumbs and cheese, and the balls of dough may be rolled in breadcrumbs and fried, rather than cooked in a soup or stew. Vegetarian dumplings can be made with vegetable suet, a type of shredded vegetable fat.\nWhen sweetened with dried fruit and spices, dumplings can be boiled in water to make a dessert. In Scotland, this is called a \"clootie dumpling\", after the cloth.\n\nGermany, Romania, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia boast a large variety of dumplings, both sweet and savoury. A dumpling is called Kloß in Northern Germany, Knödel, Nockerl or Knöpfle in Southern Germany and Austria. These are flour dumplings, the most common dumplings, thin or thick, made with eggs and semolina flour, boiled in water. Meat dumplings (called Klopse or Klöpse in North-Eastern Germany, Knöpfle and Nocken in Southern Germany) contain meat or liver. Liver dumplings are frequent additions to soup. Thüringer Klöße are made from raw or boiled potatoes, or a mixture of both, and are often filled with croutons. Bread dumplings are made with white bread and are sometimes shaped like a loaf of bread, and boiled in a napkin, in which case they are known as \"napkin dumplings\" (Serviettenknödel).\n\nMaultaschen are a Swabian (Baden-Württemberg) specialty food, consisting of an outer layer of pasta dough with a filling traditionally made of sausage meat, spinach, bread crumbs and onions and flavored with various spices. Similar in appearance to Italian ravioli, Maultaschen are usually larger, however, each Maultasche being about 8–12 cm (3-5 inches) across.\n\nThe only potato dumpling museum in the world, the Thüringer Kloßmuseum, is located in Germany, in the municipality of Heichelheim near Weimar.\nHalušky are a traditional variety of dumplings cooked in the Central and Eastern European cuisines (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine). These are small lumps cut from a thick flour and egg batter and dropped into boiling water, similar to the German Spätzle, Knöpfle, or Knödel.\nIn Romania, the dumplings are with plums inside and are called \"galusca cu prune\", while in Hungary, they are called \"nokedli\" and in Austria “Zwetschgenknödel”. Sweet varieties called \"gombóc\" are made with flour and potato dough, which is wrapped around whole plums or apricots, and then boiled and rolled in hot buttered bread crumbs. Shlishkes or \"Krumplinudli\" are small boiled potato dumplings made from the same potato dough as the sweet plum dumplings, also rolled in hot buttered bread crumbs.\n\n\"Bryndzové halušky\", considered the Slovak national dish, are small potato dumplings without a filling, served with salty sheep's cheese on top. The same dumplings are also used to create a similar dish, \"strapačky\". Also available are their related stuffed version called pirohy, usually filled with bryndza (\"bryndzové pirohy\"), quark cheese, potatoes, onions, cabbage, mushrooms, or meat.\nIn Czech cuisine dumplings have two main forms:\n\n\"Idrijski žlikrofi\" are Slovenian dumplings, regionally located in the town of Idrija. They are made from dough with potato filling and have a characteristic form of a hat. Žlikrofi are made by a traditional recipe from the 19th century, but the source of the recipe is unknown due to lack of historical sources. The dish may be served as a starter or a side dish to meat based dishes. Žlikrofi were the first Slovenian food to be classified as a Traditional speciality guaranteed dish.\n\nKhinkali is a Georgian dumpling which originated in the mountain regions of Pshavi, Mtiuleti, and Khevsureti. Varieties of khinkali spread from there across different parts of the Caucasus. The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe consistsof only minced meat (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, chili pepper, salt and cumin. Modern recipes use herbs like parsley and coriander. In Muslim-majority areas the use of beef and lamb is more prevalent. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.\n\nPierogi of Poland, varenyky of Ukraine, pelmeni of Russia and Belarus are ravioli-like crescent-shaped dumplings filled with savoury or sweet filling. Varenyky are usually boiled or steamed. Pierogi are often fried after boiling.\n\n\"Little ears\", variously called \"uszka\" in Poland, \"ushki\" (ушки) in Russia, \"vushka\" (вушка) in Ukraine, and \"\" (вушкі) in Belarus, are folded ring-shaped dumplings similar in shape to Italian tortellini or Jewish kreplach. They are stuffed with meat or mushrooms and traditionally served in borshch or clear soup. In Romania, \"little ears\" () are also served in dumpling soup (\"supă de găluşte\")\n\nKluski are a different variety of Polish dumplings.\nLithuanian dough dumplings are called koldūnai and virtiniai. Usually they are filled with meat or curd. One of the varieties is called \"Šaltanosiai\", \"Cold nosed ones\", and is made with blueberry filling. There are also potato dumplings called cepelinai or \"didžkukuliai\", filled with meat or curd inside, served with soured cream. A similar dish exists in Belarus that is called \"klyocki\" (клёцкi).\n\nRussian pelmeni are smaller than varenyky and made only of minced meat with addition of onions and spices. Sometimes the meat used is only beef, in other recipes is a mixture of beef with pork or mutton. Pelmeni should be juicy inside. They are unrelated to the pasta with which they are sometimes compared as it is a savoury main dish. They are usually boiled in water with spices and salt, or in meat bouillon, sometimes fried before serving. They are often served with plenty of sour cream.\nAn important difference between pelmeni, varenyky, and pierogi is the thickness of the dough shell—in pelmeni this is as thin as possible, and the proportion of filling to dough is usually higher. Pelmeni are never served with a sweet filling, which distinguishes them from varenyky and pierogi, which sometimes are. Also, the fillings in pelmeni are usually raw, while the fillings of \"vareniki\" and \"pierogi\" are typically precooked.\n\nThe word \"pelmeni\" is derived from \"pel'n'an\"' (пельнянь) – literally \"ear bread\" in the native Finno-Ugric Komi, Udmurt, and Mansi languages. It is unclear when pelmeni entered the cuisines of the indigenous Siberian people and when they first appeared in Russian cuisine. One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in Siberia, possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese Wonton (in some dialect is called Bāomiàn \"包面\"). Pelmeni are particularly good means of quickly preserving meat during long Siberian winter, especially eliminating the need to feed livestock during the long winter months.\n\nThe main difference between pelmeni and momos is their size—a typical pelmeni is about in diameter, whereas momos are often at least twice that size.\n\nIn Siberia, especially popular with the Buryat peoples are steamed dumplings called \"pozi\" (buuz in Mongolian, from ). They are usually made with an unleavened dough, but are often encountered leavened. The traditional filling is meat, but the kind of meat and how it is processed varies. In Mongolia, mutton is favored, and is chopped rather than ground; pork and beef mixes are more popular in Russia.\n\nManti, samsa, chiburekki, and belyashi are all popular imported dumplings.\n\nRavioli and tortellini fit the basic definition of a dumpling: these are pockets of pasta enclosing various fillings (cheese, mushrooms, spinach, seafood, or meat). Instead of being made from a ball of dough, the dough is rolled flat, cut into a shape, filled with other ingredients, and then the dough is closed around the filling.\n\nGnocchi (, widely adopted in Argentina, , ) is a different kind of Italian dumpling. The word \"gnocchi\" literally means \"lumps\", and they are rolled and shaped from a mixture of egg with potato, semolina, flour, or ricotta cheese (with or without spinach). The lumps are boiled in water and served with melted butter, grated cheese, or other pasta sauces.\n\nSimilar in shape a Calzone is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza that originated in Naples in the 18th century. A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and is stuffed with salami, ham or vegetables, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, as well as an egg. Different regional variations on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings.\n\nMaltese ravioli (\"ravjul\") are pockets of pasta filled with ricotta cheese.\n\nPastizzi and qassatat are pockets of dough that can be filled with a variety of fillings, usually ricotta (\"irkotta\") or mashed peas.\n\nIn Norwegian cuisine, dumplings have a vast variety of names, as the dialects differ substantially. Names include \"potetball\", \"klubb\", \"kløbb\", \"raspeball\", \"komle\", \"kumle\", \"kompe\", \"kumpe\", \"kodla\", \"kudle\", \"klot\", \"kams\", \"ball\", \"baill\", \"komperdøse\", \"kumperdøse\", \"kompadøs\", \"ruter\", \"ruta\", \"raskekako\", \"risk\", \"klotremat\", \"krumme\" and \"kromme\". They are usually made from crushed potatoes mixed with various types of flour, often with an emphasis on barley and wheat. In some local recipes the potatoes are dehydrated, while in others there is a mixture of raw and boiled potatoes. Occasionally they are filled with bacon. Depending on local tradition, dumplings can be sided with syrup, swede and often meat if the dumplings does not have meat filling.\n\nIn Swedish cuisine, potato dumplings of originally German origin have several regional names, mainly depending on the type of flour used. When the potato is mixed with wheat flour, which is more common in southern Sweden, it is called \"kroppkaka\". In Blekinge and parts of the island of Öland, it is traditionally made from grated raw potato, which makes it greyish in colour, while on Gotland and in Småland it is predominantly made from mashed boiled potato, and is thus whiter in colour. The \"kroppkaka\" is usually filled with diced, smoked bacon and chopped, raw onion, and is often spiced with allspice.\n\nWhen the potato is mixed with barley flour, which is traditional in northern Sweden, it is known as \"palt\" in Lapland, Västerbotten and Norrbotten, and as \"kams\" in Jämtland, Ångermanland and Medelpad. Originally, \"palt\" was eaten all over Sweden and was made from barley or rye flour alone, but during the 19th century, when potato was added and wheat became more common and inexpensive, the northern recipes retained the original name, while \"kroppkaka\", which had always been the name used on Öland for the flour dumpling, became the name for the variant in southern Sweden.\n\n\"Palt\" and \"kams\" is usually filled with diced, unsmoked bacon. However, sometimes fried bacon is served on the side of unfilled \"palt\" or \"kams\", which then is known as \"flatpalt\" or \"flatkams\", as the lack of filling makes it flatter. The most well-known \"palt\" variant is the Pitepalt from Piteå. In Dalarna, where the dish is known as \"klabbe\", it is still made without potatoes and is never filled. \"Klabbe\" is instead served with diced bacon on the side.\n\nA variant of \"palt\" is \"blodpalt\", where pig, beef or reindeer blood is mixed into the dough. Other \"palt\" variants are \"leverpalt\", with minced liver added to the dough, and \"njurpalt\", with diced kidney mixed into the bacon filling. \"Blodpalt\" also existed across the country originally, and has been found in iron age graves in Halland.\n\nThe filled \"kroppkaka\", \"palt\" or \"kams\" ball – as well as the flatter, unfilled \"flatpalt\", \"flatkams\" and \"klabbe\" – is dropped into boiling salted water and cooked until it floats. It is traditionally served warm with melted butter and lingonberry jam, although in some parts of southern Sweden the melted butter is replaced by half cream (a mix of milk and cream) or a warm milk sauce, and in parts of northern Sweden the butter is replaced by a warm milk sauce spiced with messmör. Leftover \"kroppkaka\" is often served halved and fried.\n\nUnfilled flour dumplings for use in soup are called \"klimp\" if the flour is wheat, but \"mjölpalt\" if the flour is barley or rye.\n\n\nMeat-filled manti in Armenia are typically served with yogurt or sour cream, accompanied by clear soup. \"Mantapour\" is an Armenian beef soup with manta.\n\n\"Boraki\" () are a kind of Armenian fried dumplings. The main distinction of \"boraki\" is that the minced meat is pre-fried, the boraki are formed as small cylinders with an open top, the cylinders are lightly boiled in broth and then fried. Boraki are served garnished with yogurt and chopped garlic.\n\n\"Dushbara\" (Azerbaijan: Düşbərə) is an Azeri soup with tiny lamb-filled dumplings.\n\n\"Khinkali\" () are Georgian dumplings usually filled with spiced meat. herbs (usually coriander), onions, and garlic. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat. The khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices while taking the first bite, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting. The towns of Dusheti, Pasanauri and Mtskheta are particularly famous for their khinkali.\n\n\"Mataz\" are dumplings in Circassian and some other Caucasian cuisines, closely related to manti. They typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, with greens and onions, put in a dough wrapper, either boiled or steamed. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47770304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47770304", "title": "Tom yum", "text": "Tom yum\n\nTom yum or tom yam (, ; , ) is a type of hot and sour Thai soup, usually cooked with shrimp (prawn). Tom yum has its origin in Thailand. In recent years, tom yum has been popularised around the world.\n\nThe words \"tom yam\" are derived from two Thai words. \"Tom\" refers to the boiling process, while \"yam\" refers to a Thai spicy and sour salad. Tom yum is characterised by its distinct hot and sour flavours, with fragrant spices and herbs generously used in the broth. The soup is also made with fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed red chili peppers.\n\nCommercial tom yum paste is made by crushing all the herb ingredients and stir frying in oil. Seasoning and other preservative ingredients are then added. The paste is bottled or packaged and sold around the world. Tom yum flavored with the paste may have different characteristics from that made with fresh herb ingredients. The soup often includes meats such as chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp.\n\nThe 1997 Financial Crisis in Asia, which started in Thailand, is sometimes referred to as the \"Tom Yam Kung Crisis\".\n\nThe taste of Tom yum is based on the sour and spicy tastes. A paste called \"Nam prik pao\" is prepared as a base of the soup, to which water, herbs and meat are added. The \"Nam prik pao\" is made from roasted chilies, shallots, and garlic and the ingredients are best grilled on charcoal fire.\n\nThe basic ingredient of Tom yum is shrimp or pork. If shrimp is the base ingredient, put it in soup after the soup boils. If pork is the base ingredient, put it in the soup before it boils. The most popular Tom yum base is river shrimp called “\"Tom yum Goong\"”.\n\nThe essential ingredients of Tom yum are herbs such as lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves. Other ingredients are also important especially Thai chilies, mushroom, coriander leaf (cilantro), tomatoes, sweet white onions, lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. “\"Tom yum nam khon\"” is a variety with coconut milk or evaporated milk.\n\n\nIn the modern popularized versions the soup contains also mushrooms - usually straw mushrooms or oyster mushrooms. The soup is often topped with generous sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro (coriander leaves). Sometimes Thai chili jam (\"nam phrik phao\", ) is added: this gives the soup a bright orange color and makes the chili flavor more pronounced.\n\nLess well known outside Thailand is \"tom khlong\" (ต้มโคล้ง), a spicy sour soup where the sourness, however, does not derive from lime juice but through the use of tamarind. \"Tom som\" () are soups that are also very similar to \"tom yum\" but most often do not contain lemongrass or kaffir lime leaves. Depending on the type of \"tom som\", the acidity can be derived from lime juice or from the use of tamarind.\n"}

As a sauce, \"bienmesabe\" is sometimes served poured over ice cream.\n\n\"Bienmesabe\" is a popular dessert in the cuisine of the Canary Islands, where it is served with cat's tongue cookies. The cookies may be served on the side or crushed and served atop the dessert. On the Canary Islands, the dish may also include rum. It has been described as the \"most famous\" dessert in Canarian cuisine.\n\n\"Bienmesabe\" a traditional Venezuelan dessert has been described as being influenced by the cuisine of the Moors.\n\nIn Panamanian cuisine, \"bienmesabe\" is a dessert dish prepared using milk, rice and panela (unrefined whole cane sugar), which is slow cooked.\n\nIn Puerto Rican cuisine, \"bienmesabe\" is a sweet syrup prepared using coconut milk, egg yolk and sugar. It is used poured atop dishes such as ladyfingers, sponge cake fingers and okra.\n\n\"Bienmesabe antequerano\" is prepared in a marzipan cake form.

{"id": "47775211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47775211", "title": "Ketupat", "text": "Ketupat\n\nKetupat (in Indonesian and Malay), Kupat (in Javanese and Sundanese) or Tipat (in Balinese) is a type of dumpling made from rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch, originating in Maritime Southeast Asia, specifically, what is today modern-day Indonesia. It is commonly found in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore. It is commonly described as \"packed rice\", although there are other types of similar packed rices such as \"lontong\" and \"bakchang\".\n\n\"Ketupat\" is cut open, its skin (woven palm leaf) being removed, the inner rice cake is cut in pieces, and served as staple food, as the replacement of plain steamed rice. It usually eaten with \"rendang\", \"opor ayam\", \"sayur labu\" (chayote soup), \"sambal goreng hati\" (liver in sambal) or served as an accompaniment to satay (chicken or beef or lamb in skewers) or \"gado-gado\" (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce). Ketupat is also the main element of certain dishes such as \"ketupat sayur\" (ketupat in chayote soup with tofu and boiled egg) and \"kupat tahu\" (ketupat and tofu in peanut sauce).\n\n\"Ketupat\" is related to similar dishes in other rice-farming Austronesian cultures, like the Filipino \"puso\", although the latter is not restricted to diamond shapes and traditionally come in various intricately woven designs ranging from star-like to animal-shaped. An octahedron-shaped version called \"atupat\" was also found in pre-colonial Guam, before the ancient rice cultivation in the island was replaced by corn brought by the Spanish.\n\nThe use of woven young palm leaves (\"janur\") fronds as a pouch to cook food is widespread in Maritime Southeast Asia, from Indonesia and Malaysia, to the Philippines. Ketupat is made from rice that has been wrapped in a woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the \"ketupat\" its characteristic form and texture of a rice dumpling.\nLocal stories passed down through the generations have attributed the creation of this style of rice preparation to the seafarers' need to keep cooked rice from spoiling during long sea voyages. The coco leaves used in wrapping the rice are always shaped into a triangular or diamond form and stored hanging in bunches in the open air. The shape of the package facilitates moisture to drip away from the cooked rice while the coco leaves allow the rice to be aerated and at the same time prevent flies and insects from touching it.\n\nIn Java and most of Indonesia, ketupat is linked to Islamic tradition of \"lebaran\" (Eid ul-Fitr). The earliest connection of ketupat with Islamic \"lebaran\" tradition is believed to be originated in 15th-century Sultanate of Demak. Nevertheless, ketupat is also known in non-Muslim communities, such as Hindu Balinese and people of the Philippines, which suggested that the weaving of coconut fronds has pre-Islamic origin. It was linked to the local Hindu ritual on venerating Dewi Sri, the Javanese goddess of rice. The Balinese Hindus still weaved the \"Cili\" fronds effigy of Dewi Sri as an offering, as well as weaving \"tipat\" fronds during \"Kuningan\" Balinese Hindu holy day.\n\nAccording to Javanese traditions, the Indonesian \"lebaran\" tradition was first started when Sunan Bonang, one of Wali Songo of Tuban in 15th-century Java, calls for the Muslims to elevate the perfection of their Ramadhan fast by asking forgiveness and forgiving others' wrongdoings. The tradition on preparing and consuming ketupat or \"kupat\" in Javanese language during lebaran is believed to be introduced by Raden Mas Sahid or Sunan Kalijaga, one of Wali Songo (nine Muslim saints) that spread Islam in Java. Sunan Kalijaga introduced the \"lebaran ketupat\" ritual on 8 Shawwal, a week after Eid ul-Fitr and a day after a six-day Shawwal fast. It is believed that it contains appropriate symbolism; \"kupat\" means \"ngaku lepat\" or \"admitting one's mistakes\" in Javanese language, in accordance to asking for forgiveness tradition during lebaran. The crossed weaving of palm leaves symbolises mistakes and sins committed by human beings, and the inner whitish rice cake symbolise purity and deliverance from sins after observing Ramadhan fast, prayer and rituals. Other than Java, the tradition on consuming ketupat during Eid ul-Fitr is also can be found throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara.\n\nIn various places in Indonesia, there is a ceremony called \"Lebaran Ketupat\", which is observed after the conclusion of an extra six days of fasting following Idul Fitri. In Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, thousands of Muslims celebrated \"Lebaran Ketupat\" — or \"Lebaran Topat\" as it is locally called — by visiting the graves of Muslim ulamas before partaking in communal ceremonial activities, which includes music performances, ketupat cooking competitions, to shared meals where ketupat was served as the main dish. Side dishes at the events varied, ranging from \"plecing kangkung\" (stir-fried water spinach) to the local dish of \"Ayam Taliwang\". In Central Java, \"Lebaran Ketupat\" is called \"Bada Kupat\", and was celebrated by cooking and serving ketupat and lepet (steamed sticky rice cooked in plaited palm leaves) in Semarang. In Colo, Kudus Regency, a parade of \"gunungan\" (cone-shape offering) made of ketupat, \"lepet\" and other food items on the slope of Mount Muria near the grave of noted Muslim preacher Sunan Muria, was held to celebrate \"Bada Kupat\", while on the slope of Mount Merapi in Boyolali Regency,the celebration featured a parade of livestock decorated with ketupat.\n\nAmong Hindu communities in Bali and Banyuwangi in East Java, ketupat is part of the offering and ritual of Kuningan festive celebration to conclude the Galungan holy days. During Galungan, Hindu families create and erect a \"penjor\" pole made of \"janur\" (young palm leaves), and then make some offerings to the Pura. Ten days after Galungan, the ceremony of Kuningan is observed to conclude the religious holy days. To celebrate Kuningan, Balinese Hindu families make \"tipat\" or ketupat first as offering, and then they consume some ketupat afterwards.\n\nThere are some striking similarities between Javanese Muslim \"Lebaran\" and Balinese Hindu \"Galungan-Kuningan\" holy days, of which ketupat is one. For example, the families pay a visit to the grave of their family or ancestors prior of observing the holy day, and they consume ketupat to conclude the religious festival. Although today in contemporary Indonesia, ketupat is strongly associated with Muslim celebration of Idul Fitri, this parallel phenomenon suggested the pre-Islamic native origin of ketupat, as Native Indonesian ways to shows gratitude and to celebrate festivities by making and consuming certain kind of food.\n\nThere are many varieties of \"ketupat\", with two of the more common ones being \"ketupat nasi\" and \"ketupat pulut\". \"Ketupat nasi\" is made from white rice and is wrapped in a square shape with coconut palm leaves while \"ketupat pulut\" is made from glutinous rice is usually wrapped in a triangular shape using the leaves of the fan palm (\"Licuala\"). \"Ketupat pulut\" is also called \"ketupat daun palas\" in Malaysia.\n\n\"Ketupat\" is also traditionally served by Indonesian and Malays at open houses on festive occasions such as lebaran or Idul Fitri (Hari Raya Aidilfitri). During Idul Fitri in Indonesia, \"ketupat\" is often served with either \"opor ayam\" (chicken in coconut milk), chicken or beef curry, \"rendang\", \"sambal goreng ati\" (spicy beef liver), \"krechek\" (buffalo or beef skin dish), or \"sayur labu Siam\" (chayote soup). Ketupat or \"lontong\" is also used as the replacement of plain steamed rice in \"gado-gado, karedok\", or \"pecel\".\n\nOther than replacing steamed rice or \"lontong\" in certain dishes, such as satay, \"gado-gado\", and \"ketoprak\", ketupat is also forming the essential part of other derivative dishes with certain recipes developed from it.\n\nOne of popular street food in Indonesian cities is \"Ketupat sayur\" which literary means \"ketupat in vegetables soup\". \"Ketupat sayur\" is known in two popular versions; the Betawi version from Jakarta and \"katupek sayua\" the Padang version from West Sumatra. Ketupat sayur is popular as breakfast fare in Jakarta and Padang. It consist of ketupat served with sliced \"labu siam\" (chayote) and unripe jackfruit \"gulai\" in thin and spicy coconut milk soup, topped with cooked tofu and \"telur pindang\" (spiced boiled egg), and \"krupuk\" crackers. If \"lontong\" was used in the identical recipe, it is called \"lontong sayur\" instead.\n\nKetupat also used as main ingredient in Sundanese and Javanese dish \"kupat tahu\", which is ketupat, \"tahu goreng\" (fried tofu), and bean sprouts served in peanut sauce topped with crispy \"krupuk\" crackers. Popular variants of \"kupat tahu\" includes \"Kupat tahu Kuningan\" from Kuningan Regency in West Java, \"Kupat Tahu Magelang\" from Magelang Regency, Central Java, and \"Kupat tahu Gempol\" from Surabaya, East Java.\n\nIts Balinese version is called \"tipat cantok\", which is sliced ketupat, vegetables, bean sprout, cucumber, and fried tofu mixed in peanut sauce which is made from ground fried peanuts, garlic, chili pepper, salt and tauco fermented soy paste.\n\nIn Hindu-majority Bali, ketupat is used as one of the temple offerings. In Java, among traditional Muslim abangan community, the woven empty or uncooked ketupat skin is often hung as an amulet to symbolise wealth and prosperity.\n\nBecause in Indonesia and Malaysia ketupat is strongly linked to Islamic Eid ul-Fitr, it is also used there as decorations. The empty ketupat skin woven from colourful ribbons are used as decorations to signify this festive occasions, in the same fashions as bells to signify Christmas. Colorful ribbon ketupat are often used to decorate shopping malls, offices, or as decorations of gift parcels.\n\nIn the Philippines, similar rice pouches are known as \"puso\" (literally \"heart\") and had their origins from pre-colonial animistic ritual offerings as recorded by Spanish historians. Unlike \"ketupat\", however, they are not restricted to diamond shapes and can come in a wide variety of weaving styles which still survive among various ethnic groups in the Philippines today. \"Ketupat\" are also woven differently, the leaf base and the loose leaf strands do not exit at the same point, as in most Filipino \"puso\". \"Ketupat\" somewhat resemble the \"tamu pinad\" version among Muslim Filipinos the most, which are shaped like a flattened diamond, although they are also woven differently.\n\nIn Cambodia, a similar dish of pounded sticky rice wrapped in a pentagonal woven palm leaves is called \"katom\" (កាតំ) in Khmer. It is a non-traditional variant of \"num kom\" which uses banana leaves instead of palm. In Indonesia, similar dish of compressed rice in leaf container includes \"lepet, lontong\", \"lemper\", \"arem-arem\" and \"bacang\".\n\n"}
{"id": "47775219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47775219", "title": "Dodol", "text": "Dodol\n\nDodol is a sweet toffee-like sugar palm-based confection commonly found in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is popular in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, the Philippines, South India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma, where it is called \"mont kalama\". It is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet.\n\nIn Muslim majority countries, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, dodol is commonly served during festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha as sweet treats for children. The Betawi people take pride in making homemade dodol during the Lebaran (Eid ul-Fitr), where family members will gather together to make dodol. Traditional home made dodol Betawi production center is located in Pasar Minggu area, South Jakarta. The town of Garut in West Java is the main production center of dodol in Indonesia. In Indonesia, durian \"dodol\" is popular in Medan and other Sumatran cities. Many flavors of dodol are available, including a durian flavor called \"lempuk\", which is available in Asian food stores.\n\nDodol is also popular among the Roman Catholics from the Indian west coast, also known as the former Estado da Índia Portuguesa, which includes East Indians from Mumbai, the state of Goa, and the city of Mangalore. Dodol Hj Ideris manufactures \"dodol\" and the company has now entered the Middle Eastern market, including Iran.\n\nDodol is originated in West Java, Republic of Indonesia. The history of dodol production is closely related to one of its main ingredients, \"gula aren\" or palm sugar, a traditional sugar made from the sap of \"Arenga pinnata\" plant, and also rice flour. It is a popular sweet treat and one of the oldest indigenous sweets developed in the Maritime Southeast Asia. The exact origin of dodol is unclear, nevertheless, dodol shows its remarkable diversity in the island of Java and Sumatra. In Javanese language it is called \"jenang\", while in Sundanese of West Java \"dodol\".\n\nDodol is believed to have been introduced to Southern India and Sri Lanka by Indonesians. It has also been attributed to the Portuguese, who occupied parts of the country during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several dodol recipes have been developed in Sri Lanka, such as kalu dodol.\n\nA related dessert in the Philippines is known as \"kalamay\", which is made from sugarcane sugar instead of palm sugar. It also has a liquid consistency unlike \"dodol\", since it uses ground glutinous rice rather than rice flour. However, the basic ingredients and preparation is similar.\n\nDodol is made from coconut milk, jaggery, and rice flour, and is sticky, thick, and sweet. The cooking process would reduce the contents up to half as the liquid evaporates. It normally takes up to 9 hours to cook. During the entire cooking process, the dodol must be constantly stirred in a big wok. Pausing in between would cause it to burn, spoiling the taste and aroma. The dodol is completely cooked when it is firm, and does not stick to one's fingers when touching it.\n\nThe Indonesians are the most adventurous and creative in concocting dodol. There are interesting varieties such as dodol garut, dodol kacang hijau (mung beans), dodol bengkoang (jicama), dodol nangka (jackfruit), dodol ubi talam (yam), dodol sirsak (soursop), dodol tomat (tomato), dodol tape (tapai), dodol apel malang (apple), dodol salak, dodol rumput laut (seaweed), dodol pisang (banana), dodol nenas (pineapple), dodol mangga (mango), and dodol lidah buaya (Aloe vera). Then there is dodol betawi, which takes a bit more effort to make as it utilises white and black glutinous rice.\n\nThe variants among others are:\n\nIn Indonesia's popular culture, 'dodol' in colloquial Indonesian can also be used as a slang for the word 'bodoh' to refer a person as being 'stupid' or 'illogical'. It is impolite to refer a person as 'dodol'.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47775243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47775243", "title": "Congee", "text": "Congee\n\nCongee or conjee () is a type of rice porridge or gruel popular in many Asian countries. When eaten as plain rice congee, it is most often served with side dishes. When additional ingredients such as meat, fish, and flavorings are added while preparing the congee, it is most often served as a meal on its own, especially for persons who are ill. Names for congee are as varied as the style of its preparation. Despite its many variations, it is usually a thick porridge of rice largely disintegrated after prolonged cooking in water.\n\nThe word \"congee\" comes from Tamil (\"kanji\"), a prominent food of ancient Tamil people. The English form may have arrived in the language via Portuguese traders. The food may have its origins attributed to Koozh, a porridge made of millet,that was often the staple dish of the ancient Tamil people.\n\nIn East Asia during ancient times, people named the thick congee \"chan\", the watery one \"chi\" or \"mi\". The characteristics of congee are that it is easy to digest and very simple to cook. Congee is one of the traditional Chinese foods and has thousands of years of history in China. The \"Book of Zhou\" says \"Emperor Huangdi was first to cook congee with millet\", which may be the earliest record of congee.\n\nIn other Asian cultures, it is also called \"hsan pyok\" (Burmese), \"kanji\" (Tamil/Tulu), \"kaṇhji\" (Malayalam), \"ganji\" (Kannada/Telugu), \"baw baw\" (Khmer), \"juk\" (Hakka, Cantonese, Korean), \"muay\" (Hokkien and Teochew), \"zhōu\" (Mandarin), \"cháo\" (Vietnamese), \"deythuk\" (Tibetan), \"jok\" or \"khao tom\" (Thai), \"kayu\" (Japanese), \"lúgaw\" (Tagalog), \"Bubur\" or \"kanji\" (Indonesian and Malay), \"jaulo\" (Nepali) or \"jaou\" (Bengali), which derives directly from the Chinese character (\"zhōu\", which means gruel), \"canja\" (Portuguese).\n\nTo prepare the dish, rice is boiled in a large amount of water until it softens significantly. Congee can be made in a pot or in a rice cooker. Some rice cookers have a \"congee\" setting, allowing it to be cooked overnight. The type of rice used can be either short- or long-grain, depending on what is available and regional cultural influences. Culture also often dictates the way congee is cooked and eaten.\n\nIn some cultures, congee is eaten primarily as a breakfast food or late supper; in others, it is eaten as a substitute for rice at other meals. It is often considered particularly suitable for the sick as a mild, easily digestible food.\n\nIn Burma (now called Myanmar), rice congee is called \"hsan byok\" , literally \"boiled rice\". It is very thin and plain porridge, often made with just rice and water, but sometimes with chicken or pork stock and served with a simple garnish of chopped spring onions and crispy fried onions. As in other Asian countries, rice congee is considered food for the unwell. \nWhile congee is a staple breakfast dish in China, it is called \"congee\" only in Guangdong, and is known by other local names such as \"báizhōu\" () in Central and Northern China.\n\nChinese congees () vary considerably by region. For example, to make Cantonese congee, white rice is boiled in many times its weight of water for a long time until the rice breaks down and becomes a fairly thick, white porridge. Congees made in other regions may use different types of rice with different quantities of water, producing congees of different consistencies.\n\nCongee is often eaten with \"zhacai\", salted duck eggs, lettuce and dace (\"Cirrhinus chinensis\" – Chinese mud carp) paste, bamboo shoots, \"youtiao\", \"rousong\", pickled tofu, wheat gluten, with other condiments, meat or century eggs.\n\nOther seasonings, such as white pepper and soy sauce, may be added. Grilled fish may be mixed in to provide a different texture.\n\nCongee is often eaten with fried bread sticks known as youtiao. Congee with \"youtiao\" is commonly eaten as breakfast in many areas in China. Congee can be left watery, or can be drained so it has a texture similar to Western oatmeal porridge. Congee can also be made from brown rice, although this is less common and takes longer to cook.\n\nBesides being an everyday meal, congee is considered to be food therapy for the unwell. Ingredients can be determined by their supposed therapeutic value as well as flavor.\n\nThe origin of congee is unknown, but from many historical accounts, it was usually served during times of famine, or when numerous patrons visited the temples, as a way to stretch the rice supply to feed more people.\n\nIn China, congee has also been used to feed young infants. However, the congee is not seasoned with salt or any other flavoring. Often it is mixed with steamed and deboned fish.\n\nCongee made from other grains, such as cornmeal, millet, barley, and sorghum, are common in the north of China where rice does not grow as well as other grains suited for a colder climate. Multigrain congee mixes are sold in the health food sections of Chinese supermarkets. Congee with mung beans is usually eaten with sugar, like red bean congee.\n\nA village called Lingshuicun to the West of Beijing celebrates Liu Maoheng, a Qing-era Juren who helped villagers during a period of famine, through the autumn porridge festival. The Autumn porridge festival is eating congee on that day together, the meaning is that the villagers pray for everything to go smoothly and to build a good relationship with the neightborhood.\n\nIn Cambodia, បបរ (bobar) congee in Khmer, is one of the options for breakfast along with Kuy teav noodle soup (គុយទាវ) another popular Cambodian breakfast dish. \nBobar is eaten throughout Cambodia from the countryside to the city. \n\nBobar can be eaten plain or with a variety of side dishes and toppings such as soy sauce, added to enhance taste, also eaten with dried salted fish or chhakhvay (ឆាខ្វៃ fried churros/doughnut).\n\nThere are two main versions of bobar, plain congee, and chicken congee, rice soup. The chicken rice soup, Bobor Sach Mon(បបរសាច់មាន់), is exactly the same as bobar but is filled with more herbs and chicken. Usually eaten during cold seasons or when someone is sick. Once the bobar is finished just like regular bobar, a variety of toppings can be added to enhance the taste such as, bean sprout, green onions, cilantro, pepper, along with the dried fish and chhakhvay on the side. \n\nIn Taiwan, congee is prepared of rice and water, with few other ingredients. Sweet potato is often added for taste.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or the thick supernatant water from overcooked rice, is known as \"kanji\". Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available in different parts of Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state \"kanji\", and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. \"Kanji\" is prepared with rice or \"ragi\". Nuts and spices are added to the \"kanji\" depending on the economic status or health requirements. Rice \"kanji\" is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually \"jaggery\") or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. \"Ragi kanji\" is prepared by drying \"ragi\" sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. \"Ragi kanji\" can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses \"jevvarisi\" (sago in English, \"sabudana\" in Hindi) in \"kanji\". Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.\n\nIn the Konkan region of India, Kanji, also known as Pez, is a home remedy for treating a fever as it is easy to digest. The farming and manual labour community of the same region on the other hand consume pez on a daily basis in the late morning as a source of energy. Variants of the dish include nachnyachi pez (ambil) which is made with ragi grains and rice, athwal or metheachi pez is a sweeter version which is made with rice, Fenugreek seeds and jaggery, which is usually served to a nursing mother. The rice here is usually of boiled variety and is often accompanied with dry fish, vegetable or pickle.\n\nIn the state of Kerala, Kanji (pronounced as kanni) is considered as a main course particularly for dinner by majority. This is normally taken with roasted coconut chutney, tossed Moong dal popularly known as Payar,roasted Pappadam (Lentil crackers),puzhukku(a side dish consisting mainly of roottubers\\underground stems, especially during Thiruvathira );sometimes coconut scrapings are also added to the kanji to increase the flavour.The royal households as well as rich people used to have a special kind of Kanji called as Palkanji (Milk Congee) where milk was substituted for water base. During the Malayalam month of Karkkidakam, a medicinal kanji is made using Ayurvedic herbs, milk and jaggery. Karkkidakam is known as the month of diseases since the monsoon starts during Karkkidakam. Karikkidaka Kanji is eaten to promote the immune system.\n\nPoor households of Kerala used to re-cook leftover rice and all available leftover curries into Congee water and take as a mix-mash dish known as Pazhamkanji (Old Congee).\n\nPazhamkanji means old congee (leftover from previous day). It is not necessarily eaten by poor people, neither it is necessarily re-heated with leftover curries.\n\nAccording to the Indian writer Madhur Jaffrey, \"kanji\" is, or derives from, a Tamil word for \"boilings\"—which refers to the porridge and also to any water in which rice has been cooked.\n\nMuslims of south India especially Tamil Muslim, Mappila and Beary prepare special congee during Ramadhan called \"nombu kanji\" literally \"fasting porridge.\" This is prepared by adding spices like turmeric, dry ginger, pepper, onion, and coconut paste to the congee. Sometimes fenugreek seeds are added to it to enhance the flavor.\n\nIn the Goa, Udupi and Mangalore districts, people usually eat rice \"ganji\" in a variant manner made by Kannada-speaking, Tulu-speaking or Konkani people in and around Udupi and Mangalore (Karnataka, South India). There, parboiled rice (\"kocheel akki\" in Kannada, \"oorpel aari\" for black rice, \"bolenta aari\" for white rice in Tulu or \"ukde tandool\" in Konkani) is steamed with a large amount of water. \"Jain ganji matt\" are famous in these districts. Usually, simple \"ganji\" with pickle and milk are served, in \"jain matts\". Fresh coconut is grated, and the resulting milk skimmed and added to the \"ganji\" (called \"paez or pyaaz\" in Konkani), which is served hot with fish curry, coconut chutney, or Indian pickles. In Goa, it is normally served with dried or fresh cooked fish, \"papad\" or vegetables.\n\nIn the state of Andhra Pradesh, it is called \"ganji\" in Telugu and mostly eaten by the very poor. Ganji is made by boiling rice in large amounts of water and then the filtered liquid is known as Ganji. Ganji mixed with buttermilk is believed to add to the flavor, and is also suggested by doctors for patients with ailing health.\n\n\"Kaanji\" is a traditional Odia dish. It is a soup-based dish like \"dal\", but tastes a little sour. It is made of rice starch fermented for a few days in an earthen pot. This is considered a very healthy dish as lots of winter vegetables are used as main ingredients. It is seasoned with mustard seeds and turmeric and served hot.. Pakhala is a separate dish with certain similarities to the congee.\n\nIn the Buddhist Yāgu Sutta of the Aṅguttara Nikāya (AN 5.207), the Buddha recommends eating rice porridge, \"yāgu\": \"There are these five benefits in rice porridge. What five? It stills hunger, dispels thirst, settles wind, cleans out the bladder, and promotes the digestion of the remnants of undigested food. These are the five benefits of rice porridge.\".\n\nIn Indonesian, congee is called \"bubur\", and it is a favourite breakfast food in the country. Travelling \"bubur ayam\" vendors frequently pass through residential streets in the morning selling the dish. A popular version is \"bubur ayam\", which is rice congee with shredded chicken meat. It is also served with many condiments, such as green onion, crispy fried shallot, fried soybean, Chinese crullers (\"youtiao\", known as \"cakwe\" in Indonesia), both salty and sweet soy sauce, and sometimes it is topped with yellow chicken broth and \"kerupuk\" (Indonesian style crackers). Unlike many other Indonesian dishes, it is not spicy; \"sambal\" or chili paste is served separately.\n\nThe food hawkers sometimes have \"sate\" to go with it, made from quail egg or chicken intestine, liver, gizzard, or heart.\n\nOn Bali's north coast, famously in a village called Bondalem, there is a local congee dish called \"mengguh\", a popular local chicken and vegetable rice congee that is spicier than common \"bubur ayam\" and more similar to \"tinutuan\", using a spice mix of onions, garlic, coriander seeds, pepper and chili.\n\nIn another region of Indonesia — the city of Manado in North Sulawesi, there is a very popular type of congee called \"tinutuan\", or also known as \"bubur Manado\" (Manadonese porridge). It is rice porridge served with ample amount of vegetables. A bit different from the one sold in Java, it is made from rice porridge, enriched with vegetables, including \"kangkung\" (water spinach), corn kernels, yam or sweet potato, dried salted fish, \"kemangi\" (lemon basil) leaves and \"melinjo\" (\"Gnetum gnemon\") leaves.\n\nSago flour is made into porridge in eastern Indonesia, as the staple food of Maluku and Papuan people. The sago congee is called \"papeda\", and usually is eaten with yellow soup made from tuna or \"mubara\" fish spiced with turmeric and lime.\n\n, or often is the name for the type of congee eaten in Japan, which typically uses ratios of 5:1 or 7:1 and is cooked for about 30 minutes.\n\n\"Kayu\" may be made with just rice and water, and is often seasoned with salt. Eggs can be beaten into it to thicken it into gruel. Toppings may be added to enhance flavour; Welsh onion, salmon, roe, ginger, and \"umeboshi\" (pickled \"ume\" fruit) are among the most common. \"Miso\" or chicken stock may be used to flavor the broth. Most Japanese electric rice cookers have a specific setting for cooking congee.\n\nIn Japan \"kayu\" – because it is soft and easily digestible – is regarded as a food particularly suitable for serving to invalids and the elderly. For similar reasons \"kayu\" is commonly the first solid food served to Japanese infants; it is used to help with the transition from liquids to normally cooked \"plain\" rice, the latter being a major part of the Japanese diet.\n\nA type of \"kayu\" referred to as \"nanakusa-gayu\" (, \"seven herb porridge\") is traditionally eaten on 7 January with special herbs that some believe protect against evils and invite good luck and longevity in the new year. As a simple, light dish, \"nanakusa-gayu\" serves as a break from the many heavy dishes eaten over the Japanese New Year.\n\n\"Kayu\" is also used in Shinto divination rituals.\n\n\"Juk\" (; ) is a Korean category for porridges made by boiling rice and/or other grains or legumes, such as beans, sesame, nuts, and pumpkin, with much more water than \"bap\". \"Juk\" is often eaten warm, especially as a morning meal, but is now eaten at any time of the day.\n\nDepending on the ingredients and consistency, \"juk\" can be considered as a food for recuperation, a delicacy, or famine food. It is known to have nutritional benefits, and is considered to be beneficial to digestion because of its soft texture. It is a staple \"get well\" dish; a dish to eat when one is sick or recovering from bad health. \"Juk\" is also considered an ideal food for babies, the ill or elderly, as it is easily eaten and digested. It is also sold commercially by many chain stores in South Korea, and is a common takeout dish.\n\nThere are more than forty varieties of \"juk\" mentioned in old documents. The most basic form of \"juk\", made from plain rice, is called \"ssaljuk\" (; \"rice porridge\") or \"huinjuk\" (; \"white porridge\"). Being largely unflavored, it is served with a number of more flavorful side dishes, such as \"jeotgal\" (salted seafood), various types of kimchi, and other side dishes.\n\nNotable varieties include \"jatjuk\" made from finely ground pine nuts, \"jeonbok-juk\" made with abalones, \"yulmu-juk\" made from yulmu (\"Coix lacryma-jobi\" var. \"ma-yuen\"), and \"patjuk\" made from red beans.\n\nIn Laos, congee is called \"khao piak\", literally \"wet rice\" (, ). It is cooked with rice and chicken broth or water. The congee is then garnished with fried garlic, scallions and pepper. The dish will sometimes be served with chicken, quail eggs, century eggs or \"youtiao\". In Laos, congee is usually eaten as breakfast and during the cold season.\n\n\"Lugaw\" (pronounced ) is the Filipino generic term for rice gruel. It encompasses a wide variety of dishes, ranging from savory dishes very similar to Chinese-style congee to dessert dishes. In the Visayan regions, savory \"lugaw\" are known as \"pospas\". \"Lugaw\" typically use glutinous rice (Tagalog: \"malagkit\"; Visayan: \"pilit\"). It is usually thicker than other Asian congees, retaining the shape of the rice, yet with a similar texture. \n\nSavory versions of \"lugaw\" are flavored with ginger and traditionally topped with scallions and toasted garlic. Dried red safflower (\"kasubha\") may also be used as a topping, mainly as a visual garnish and to impart a more appealing yellow tinge to the dish. As with Japanese \"okayu\", fish or chicken stock may be used to flavor the broth. The most popular variants of \"lugaw\" include \"arroz caldo\" (chicken), \"goto\" (beef tripe), \"lugaw na baboy\" (pork), \"lugaw na baka\" (beef), and \"lugaw na tokwa't baboy\" (diced tofu and pork). Other versions can also use \"tinapa\" (smoked fish), \"palaka\" (frog legs), \"utak\" (brain [of pig]), \"dila\" (tongue [of pig]), and \"litid\" ([beef] ligaments). They are traditionally seasoned with calamansi, fish sauce (\"patis\"), soy sauce (\"toyo\"), and black pepper. It is often served to the ill and the elderly, and is favored among Filipinos living in colder climates because it is warm, soft, and easy to digest.\n\nDessert versions of \"lugaw\" include \"champorado\" (\"lugaw\" with home-made chocolate topped with milk), \"binignit\" (\"lugaw\" in coconut milk with various fruits and root crops), and \"ginataang mais\" (\"lugaw\" with sweet corn and coconut milk), among others. Like the savory versions, they are usually eaten for breakfast, but can also be eaten as a snack. In Hiligaynon-speaking areas, \"lugaw\" may refer to \"binignit\".\n\nIn Portugal, a traditional soup made of rice and chicken meat is named \"canja\" or \"Canja de galinha\". The Portuguese likely picked up the dish from their colony in Goa, India; where the soup remains a staple (particularly for the ill). The rice is not cooked for as long as in Asian congee, so it is very soft, but not disintegrated. Traditionally, a boiling fowl containing small, immature eggs is used; the eggs are carefully boiled and served in the \"canja\". This soup is sometimes served with a fresh mint leaf on top. Strongly valued as comfort food, it is traditionally given to people recovering from disease, as in Asia, and in some regions of Portugal, there is even an ancient custom of feeding the mother a strict diet of \"canja\" in the first weeks after childbirth. It is also eaten traditionally in Brazil and Cape Verde, former Portuguese colonies.\n\nIn Singapore, Teochew porridge or Singapore-style porridge is a version of Singapore congee. In Singapore, it's considered a comfort food for both breakfast as well as supper. Teochew porridge dish often accompanied with various small plates of side dishes. Usually, it's served as a banquet of meats, fish egg and vegetables eaten with plain rice porridge. The recipes that early immigrants prepared in Singapore have been modified over the generations to suit local tastes. Singapore Teochew style porridge is usually consumed with a selection of Singaporean Chinese side dishes like Nasi Padang. There is no fixed list of side dishes, but in Singapore, accompaniments typically include lor bak (braised pork), steamed fish, stir-fried water spinach (kangkong goreng), salted egg, fish cake, tofu, omelette, minced meat, braised tau kway, Hei Bee Hiang (fried shrimp chilli paste), and vegetables.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, several types of congee are known as \"kenda\" in Sinhalese. Sinhala people use congee as a breakfast, a side dish, an accessory to indigenous medical therapies, and a sweet. \"Kenda\" can be prepared with many ingredients, including rice, roasted rice, rice flour, finger millet flour, sago, coconut milk, herbs, tubers, \"kitul\" flour, and mung bean. When it is prepared with rice and water only, it is known as \"hal kenda\". If salt is added to bring a much saltier taste, it is known as \"lunu kenda,\" a dish commonly used as a supplementary diet in purgation therapy in indigenous medical traditions. If roasted rice is used, the congee becomes \"bendi hal kenda\", utilized to treat diarrheal diseases. If rice flour and coconut milk are the main ingredients, such congee is known as \"kiriya\". If finger millet flour and water is used, it is known as \"kurakkan anama\". If coconut milk is added, the dish is called \"kurakkan kenda\". If sago is used, such congee is known as \"sawu kenda\". A special type of congee prepared from the byproducts of coconut oil production is known as \"pol kiri kenda\". There are many varieties of \"kola kenda\", congee with herbs as an ingredient; sometimes, a \"vaidya\" or \"veda mahttaya\" (a physician trained in indigenous medical traditions) might prescribe a special type of \"kola kenda\", known under such circumstances as \"behet kenda\". Sinhala villagers use specific tubers for preparing congee, such as \"Diascorea\" species tubers. If \"kitul\" flour is mixed with boiling water and coconut milk added to it, this special type of congee is known as \"kitul piti kenda\". \"Kenda\" prepared with mung beans is known as \"mung eta kenda\".\n\nMost of the time, \"kiriya\", \"kurakkan kenda\", \"sawu kenda\", \"pol kiri kenda\" and \"kitul piti kenda\" are used as sweets. Sugar, candy, dates, raisins, cashew nut, jaggery, and treacle are among the ingredients that may be added to sweeten these congees.\n\nCongee is also eaten by Sri Lankan Moors for \"iftar\" during Ramadan. It is also occasionally made with oats. Tamils and Moors in Sri Lanka call it \"aarisi kanji\" (rice \"kanji\") and use chicken or beef for it. It is sometimes made with milk (\"paal kanji\"), and there are many other combinations with appropriate prefixes in Tamil.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, rice congee, known as \"chok\" (, , a loanword from Min Nan Chinese), is often served as breakfast with a raw or partially cooked egg added. Minced pork or beef and chopped spring onions are usually added, and the dish is optionally topped with a small donut-like \"pathongko\", fried garlic, slivered ginger, and spicy pickles such as pickled radish. Although it is more popular as a breakfast dish, many stores specializing in \"chok\" sell it throughout the day. Variations in the meat and toppings are also frequently found. It is especially popular during Thailand's cool season. Thai congee is prepared similarly to Lao congee.\n\nPlain rice congee, known as \"khao tom kui\" (), is served at specialty restaurants, which serve a multitude of side dishes to go with it, such as \"yam kun chiang\" (a Thai salad made with sliced dried Chinese sausages), \"mu phalo\" (pork stewed in soy sauce and five-spice powder), and \"mu nam liap\" (minced pork fried with chopped Chinese olives).\n\nFor notable \"chok\" eateries in Bangkok viz Bang Rak on Charoen Krung, which is the Bib Gourmand from Michelin Guidebook, and Talat Noi in Chinatown beside Wat Traimit near Hua Lamphong, with Chok Chai neighbourhood in Lat Phrao, for sale here 24 hours and has many franchise in various places.\n\nIn \"khao tom kui\" such as Yaowarat, and Wong Wian Yi Sip Song Karakadakhom (July 22nd Circle) neighbourhoods etc.\n\nIn Vietnam, rice congee, called \"cháo\" (), is sometimes cooked with pandan leaves or Asian mung bean. In its simplest form (plain rice porridge, known as \"cháo hoa\"), it is a food for times of famine and hardship to stretch the rice ration. Alternately, as is especially common among Buddhist monks, nuns and lay persons, it can be a simple breakfast food eaten with pickled vegetables or fermented tofu (\"chao\").\n\nDespite its ubiquity among the poor, it is also popular as a main dish when cooked with a variety of meats. For example, \"cháo gà\" is cooked with chicken, garlic, and ginger. The rice porridge is cooked in chicken broth, and when the chicken is cooked, the meat is sliced and layered on a bed of shredded raw cabbage and sliced scallions and drizzled with a vinegar-based sauce, to be eaten as a side dish. Other combinations include \"cháo vịt\" (duck porridge), which is cooked in the same manner as chicken porridge. \"Cháo lòng heo\" is made with \"lòng heo\", a variety of offal from pork or duck with sliced portions of congealed pork blood. \"Cháo\" is typically served with \"quẩy\" on the side.\n\nYoutiao is usually added to congee especially at congee vendors.\n\nIt is also common to eat \"cháo\" when ill, as it is believed the porridge is easy to digest while being fortifying. For such purposes, the \"cháo\" is sometimes cooked with roasted white rice, giving the porridge broth a more nuanced body and a subtle, nutty flavor. In some parts of Vietnam, local customs call for making \"cháo\" as offerings for the \"wandering souls\" during the Buddhist Vu Lan summer feast.\n\n"}

Condiments such as black pepper or white pepper, and finely chopped scallions and tofu are optional, but commonly added to the soup. The soup is finished by adding a thin stream of beaten eggs to the boiling broth in the final moments of cooking, creating thin, silken strands or flakes of cooked egg that float in the soup. Egg drop soup using different recipes is known to be a simple-to-prepare soup in different East Asian and Western countries.\n\nIn the United States, egg drop soup is often one of the main soups offered in American Chinese cuisine, and is also called \"egg flower soup\", a literal translation of its Chinese name, on the menus of some restaurants. Cornstarch may be used to thicken it.\nIn Chinese cuisine, egg drop soups have a thinner consistency than most common Western variants. Depending on the region, they may be garnished with ingredients such as tofu, scallion, bean sprouts and corn.\n\nIn Japan, egg is often dropped unscrambled as the topping for \"tsukimi\" () udon or soba. The moon-like appearance of the whole yolk is responsible for the name, which means \"moon viewing.\"\n\nIn Italy, \"stracciatella\", a version made of egg and parmesan cheese, is a popular variant of egg drop soup.\n\nSimilarly in France \"le tourin\", a garlic soup, is made with egg whites which are drizzled into the soup in a similar way to how traditional egg drop soup is made.\n\nAlso in Spain, the similar and traditional \"sopa de ajo\" (literally \"garlic soup\") uses egg whites to thicken the broth in a similar fashion.\n\nIn Austria, egg drop soup (Eierflockensuppe or Eierflöckchensuppe) is a simple, traditional recipe generally made for very young children or sick people. Scrambled eggs are mixed with flour and then poured into boiling soup in order to make small egg dumplings. Spices can be added to the egg-flour mixture according to taste. A similar recipe exists in Polish cuisine (kluski lane, lit. \"poured noodles\"), with the egg-flour mixture either poured directly into soup, or into boiling water, then strained and added to a soup or sauce. For children, often simmering milk (optionally with sugar) is used in place of soup.\n\nIn Russia, semolina is usually boiled in the chicken stock before the eggs are whisked in for the more substantial fare, and flavored with chopped scallion and black pepper. A simple egg dough dumplings similar to lazy vareniki or the Ukrainian halushky are a frequent addition in the southern regions.\n\nIn Cyprus and Greece the egg is beaten and then slowly stirred in the soup so it does not curdle.

It consists of a spicy sauce usually containing preserved vegetables (often including \"zha cai\" (榨菜), lower enlarged mustard stems, or \"ya cai\" (芽菜), upper mustard stems), chili oil, Sichuan pepper, minced pork, and scallions served over noodles. The dish can either be served dry or as a noodle soup.\n\nSesame paste and/or peanut butter is sometimes added, and occasionally replaces the spicy sauce, usually in the Taiwanese and American Chinese style of the dish. In this case, \"dandanmian\" is considered as a variation of \"ma jiang mian\" (麻醬麵), sesame sauce noodles, although \"ma jiang mian\" usually refers to a specific Shanghainese dish. In American Chinese cuisine, \"dandanmian\" is often sweeter, less spicy, and less soupy than its Sichuan counterpart. \n\nThe name refers to a type of carrying pole (\"dan dan\") that was used by walking street vendors who sold the dish to passers-by. The pole was carried over the shoulder, with two baskets containing noodles and sauce attached at either end. As the noodles were affordable due to their low cost, the local people gradually came to call them \"dandan\" noodles, referencing the street vendors. Literally, the name translates as \"noodles carried on a pole\", but may be better translated as \"peddler's noodles\".\n\nA variety of English spellings are used. The first word may be either \"dandan\", \"dundun\" or \"tantan\", and the last word may also be spelled \"mein\" (Cantonese pronunciation).\n\nThe same sauce is frequently served over poached chicken (called \"bonbon\" or \"bangbang\" chicken (棒棒鸡)), and on steamed, meat-filled dumplings in another Sichuan dish called \"suanla chaoshou\".

After refrigeration to firm the meat, it is cut into thin slices. The pork is then returned to a wok and shallow fried in oil, usually along with some vegetables. The most commonly used vegetables are napa cabbage, bell peppers, and scallions.\n\nAnother simple way of preparing this dish is to cook the meat by itself until it is done, then fry it along with the other ingredients. An alternative method involves frying the meat by itself until cooked, frying the vegetables separately, then frying everything together. This approach of frying the pork twice led to the name \"twice-cooked pork\".\n\nPremade twice-cooked pork sauces are also available from food manufacturers.\n\nThe origins of twice-cooked pork are unknown.\n\nThe Sichuan people have a tradition of enjoying a feast every 1st and 15th of lunar months, with twice-cooked pork as the main course. \n\nhttps://www.bilibili.com/video/av42238250?from=search&seid=1420966040512242167\n\n"}

A common type of ground meat is ground beef, but many other types of meats are prepared in a similar fashion, including pork, lamb, and poultry. In the Indian subcontinent, both mutton and goat meat are also minced to produce \"keema.\"\n\nGround meat is used in a wide variety of dishes, by itself, or mixed with other ingredients. It may be formed into meatballs which are then fried, baked, steamed, or braised. They may be cooked on a skewer to produce dishes such as \"kabab koobideh\", \"adana kebabı\" and \"ćevapi\". It may be formed into patties which are then grilled or fried (hamburger), breaded and fried (\"menchi-katsu\", Pozharsky cutlet), or braised (Salisbury steak). It may be formed into meatloaves or pâtés and baked. It may also be used as a filling or stuffing for meat pies and \"böreks\", and also as stuffing. It may be made into meat sauce such as ragù, which in turn is used in dishes like pastitsio and moussaka, or mixed with sauce and served on a bun as a sloppy joe sandwich. It may also be cooked with beans, tomatoes, and/or spices to make chili con carne.\n\n\"Keema\" or \"qeema\" is used in a variety of dishes such as a stewed or fried curry dish of minced beef, mutton, or other meats with green peas or potatoes. It usually includes ghee/butter, onions, garlic, ginger, chilis, and spices. \"Keema\" can be grilled on a skewer, and called \"seekh\" kebab, or used as a filling for samosas or naan.\n\nThe word ultimately comes from the Turkic word \"qıyma\" meaning 'minced meat', and is thus related to the Persian \"gheimeh\", the Turkish \"kıyma\", and the Greek κιμάς.\n\nGround meat has food safety concerns very different from whole cuts of meat. If undercooked, it can lead to food poisoning. In a whole cut from an animal, the interior of the meat is essentially sterile, even before cooking all bacterial contamination is on the outer surface of the meat. However, when meat is ground, bacterial contamination from the surface can be distributed throughout the meat. If ground beef is not well cooked all the way through, there is a significant chance that enough pathogenic bacteria will survive to cause illness. Moreover, the warming will speed the reproduction of bacteria. Undercooked Jack in the Box hamburgers contaminated in this manner were responsible for four deaths and the illness of hundreds of people in 1993.\n\nTo ensure the safety of ground meat is distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, federal food and nutrition programs, and the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef purchased this way. A 2010 United States National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department's ground beef safety standards, evaluated how the standards compare to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and looked at ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program. The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of food-borne disease will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.\n\n"}

It is a savoury snack made of thin crepe pastry skin called \"lumpia wrapper\" enveloping a mixture of savoury fillings, consists of chopped vegetables (carrots, cabbages, green beans, bamboo shoots and leeks) or sometimes also minced meat (chicken, shrimp, pork or beef). It is often served as an appetizer or snack, and might be served deep fried or fresh (unfried). \"Lumpia\" is quite similar to fresh popiah or fried spring rolls popular in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Indonesia \"lumpia\" has become a favorite snack, and is known as a street hawker food in the country. In the Philippines \"lumpia\" is one of the most common dishes found in any kind of gathering celebration.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, it is spelled \"loempia\", which is the old Indonesian spelling for \"lumpia\", and has also become the generic name for \"spring roll\" in Dutch. A variant is the Vietnamese lumpia, wrapped in a thinner pastry, though still close in size to a spring roll, in which the wrapping closes the ends off completely, which is typical for \"lumpia\". \n\nThe term \"lumpia\" derives from Hokkien \"lunpia\" (), which is an alternate term for \"popiah\". Spring rolls of different shapes, sizes and fillings have been a popular snack in East Asia and Southeast Asia for centuries. It is believed that the spring rolls are originated from China. It was a seasonal food consumed during the spring, started as a pancake filled with the new season's spring vegetables, a welcome change from the preserved foods of the long winter months. The recipes, both fried and fresh versions, were brought by Chinese immigrants from the Fujian province of China to Southeast Asia and became popular when they settled in Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nFilipino lumpia wrapper (a thin egg crêpe) is characteristically thinner than other spring roll variants. It is traditionally made with egg, flour, and water with a bit of salt mixed into a wet dough. It is left to stand for a few hours before cooking. A ball of dough is taken with one hand and smeared into a heated large flat metal plate greased with oil until a very thin circular film of it adheres to the pan and fries. It is cooked for a few seconds then quickly taken out and left to dry. \n\nIn modern mass production, Filipino lumpia wrappers are generally made by automated assembly-line machines similar to those used to make spring roll wrappers, differing only in the recipe and the thickness of the wrapper. It uses a revolving drum.\n\nChinese influence is evident in Indonesian cuisine, such as \"bakmi\", \"mie ayam\", \"pangsit\", \"mie goreng\", \"kwetiau goreng\", \"nasi goreng\", \"bakso\", and \"lumpia\". Throughout the country, spring rolls are generally called \"lumpia\", however, sometimes an old Chinese Indonesian spelling is used; spelled as \"loen pia\". In Indonesia \"lumpia\" is associated with Chinese Indonesian cuisine and commonly found in cities where significant Chinese Indonesian settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is \"Lumpia Semarang\", available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian \"lumpia\" is rarely using minced pork as fillings. This was meant to cater for larger Muslim clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian \"lumpia\" is commonly filled with seasoned chopped \"rebung\" (bamboo shoots) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby shallots or leeks in sweet \"tauco\" (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, \"lumpia\" is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on \"Lumpia Semarang\", or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of \"kue\" (Indonesian traditional snack) or \"jajan pasar\" (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper \"lumpia\" is sold as part of \"gorengan\" (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians also noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, therefore spicy hot \"sambal\" chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as dipping sauce or condiment.\n\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, Semarang, where significant Chinese Indonesian settles, \"lumpia Semarang\" is perhaps the most popular \"lumpia\" variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this \"lumpia\" is filled with bamboo shoots, dried shrimp, chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.\n\nNamed after the city of Surabaya in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made. It is made of mostly the same ingredients of lumpia semarang, but much less sweet in taste.\n\n\"Lumpia goreng\" is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms. Although usually filled only with vegetables, the fried spring rolls might be enrichen with minced beef, chicken, or prawns. There is also a common, cheap and simple variant of fried lumpia, eaten not as a single dish but as part of assorted \"gorengan\" (Indonesian fritters) snack, sold together with fried battered tempeh, tofu, oncom, sweet potato and cassava. The filling is simple and modest, only filled with \"bihun\" (rice vermicelli) with chopped carrots and cabbages. Usually eaten with fresh bird's eye chili pepper. The sliced lumpia goreng is also the ingredient of \"soto mie\" (noodle soto).\n\nIt literally means \"wet spring roll\", or often translated as \"fresh spring roll\" which means spring roll without frying. It is similar to the Vietnamese spring roll with bean sprouts, carrots, shrimp and/or chicken, and served with sweet \"tauco\" (another Hokkien word for salted soybeans) sauce.\n\nPopular appetizer in Indonesia, chicken lumpia, with fillings including shredded chicken, sliced carrot, onion and garlic, seasoned with sugar, salt and pepper. In Yogyakarta, there is a popular chicken lumpia variant called \"Lumpia Mutiara\", sold in front of Mutiara Hotel in Malioboro street.\n\nVegetarian lumpia, usually filled with glass noodles, shredded cabbage, lettuce, julienned carrots, minced garlic and celery, seasoned with soy sauce and sweet chili sauce.\n\nBite size smaller lumpia snack, the skin pastry crepes is the same with common lumpia; however it is filled only with \"abon\" (beef floss) or \"ebi\" (dried prawn floss). The much smaller and drier lumpia with similar beef or prawn floss filling is called \"sumpia\", its diameter is about the same as human finger.\n\n\"Lumpia\" were introduced to the Philippines by early Hokkien immigrants and traders from Fujian since at least the 7th century CE. They have been thoroughly nativized to Philippine cuisine over the centuries and are found throughout the islands. They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino \"lumpia\" can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin pastry-like egg crêpe wrapper. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of cigars or \"cigarillos\", though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the crêpe and the shape of the \"lumpia\" give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in vinegar-based sauces, banana ketchup, or sweet chili sauce. Fresh \"lumpia\", however, typically have wrappers closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of \"lumpia\", fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.\n\nFilipino \"lumpia\" also have a unique and extremely popular dessert subcategory, the \"turon\". These are \"lumpia\" variants either cooked with a glazing of caramelized sugar; or served with a sprinkling of sugar and/or drowned in \"latik\" (coconut caramel), syrup, or honey. \"Turon\" are traditionally filled with ripe saba bananas and jackfruit; but they can also use a wide variety of other sweet fillings, from sweet potato to ube. \n\n\"Dinamita\" or \"dynamite lumpia\" is a deep-fried stuffed whole chili pepper wrapped in a thin egg crêpe. The stuffing is usually \"giniling\" (ground beef or pork), cheese, and spices, but it can also be adapted to use a wide variety of other ingredients, including tocino, ham, bacon, and shredded chicken. It is commonly eaten as an appetizer or as a companion to beer.\n\nA version of \"lumpia\" with filled with shredded meat cooked adobo style.\n\n\"Lumpiang gulay\" (\"vegetable spring roll\"), a version of \"lumpia\" usually consisting of various chopped vegetables and a small amount of pork or shrimp. The types of vegetables used can vary greatly, even including rare ingredients in \"lumpia\" like tomatoes. It is a fried version. It is not a vegetarian dish by default, but vegan and vegetarian versions can be made from the basic recipe.\n\n\"Lumpiang hubad\" (\"naked spring roll\") is \"lumpiang sariwa\" (fresh lumpia) served without the crêpe wrapping. Essentially this is not anymore a lumpia but is an alternative way of eating the fresh lumpia's traditional fillings.\n\n\"Lumpiang isda\" (\"fish \"lumpia\") is filled primarily with fish flakes and fried. It is also known as \"lumpiang galunggong\" (blackfin scad), \"lumpiang bangus\" (milkfish), \"lumpiang tulingan\" (yellowfin tuna), etc., depending on the type of fish used. A common version of this combines fish flakes with \"malunggay\" (moringa) leaves.\n\n\"Lumpiang keso\", more commonly known as \"cheese \"lumpia\"\" or \"cheese sticks\", is deep-fried \"lumpia\" with a slice of cheese (usually cheddar) as filling. Usually served with a dipping sauce made of a mixture of banana ketchup and mayonnaise.\n\n\"Lumpiang labong\" is similar to \"lumpiang ubod\", but is made with \"labong\" (bamboo shoots), rather than heart of palm. It can be eaten fresh or fried.\n\n\"Lumpiang prito\" (\"fried spring roll\"), is the generic name for a subclass of \"lumpia\" served fried. It usually refers to \"lumpiang gulay\" or \"lumpiang togue\". They can come in sizes as small as \"lumpiang shanghai\" or as big as \"lumpiang sariwa\". It is usually eaten with vinegar and chili peppers, or a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi juice known as \"toyomansi\".\n\n\"Lumpiang sariwa\" (Tagalog: \"fresh spring roll\") or \"fresh \"lumpia\"\", consists of minced minced vegetables and/or various pre-cooked meat or seafood and jicama (\"singkamas\") as an extender, encased in a double wrapping of lettuce leaf and a yellowish egg crêpe. Egg is often used to hold the wrap together. The accompanying sauce is made from chicken or pork stock, a starch mixture, crushed roasted peanuts and fresh garlic. This variety is not fried and is usually around 5 centimetres in diameter and 15 centimetres in length. It is derived from the original Chinese popiah.\n\n\"Lumpiang Shanghai\" is regarded as the most basic type of \"lumpia\" and is one of the most commonly served dishes in Filipino gatherings. It is characteristically filled with sautéed ground pork, minced onion, carrots, and spices with the mixture sometimes held together by beaten egg. They have numerous variants that contain other ingredients like green peas, \"kinchay\" (Chinese parsley) or raisins. \"Lumpiang Shanghai\" is commonly served with sweet and sour sauce, but ketchup (tomato or banana) and vinegar are popular alternatives. This variant is typically smaller than other \"lumpia\". Despite the name, it does not originate from Shanghai or China.\n\n\"Lumpiang singkamas\" is similar to \"lumpiang ubod\", but it is made primarily with julienned strips of \"singkamas\" (jicama) rather than heart of palm. It can be eaten fresh or fried.\n\nA version of \"lumpiang gulay\" that is filled primarily with bean sprouts (\"togue\") and various other vegetables such as string beans and carrots. Small morsels of meat, seafood or tofu may be added. Though it is the least expensive of the variants, the preparation the cutting of vegetables and meats into small pieces and pre-cooking these may prove taxing and labour-intensive. It is a fried version.\n\n\"Lumpiang ubod\" are another variation which are made from julienned \"ubod\" (heart of the coconut tree) as the main ingredients. They can be fried or served as \"lumpiang sariwa\". They originated from Silay, Negros Occidental, where a variant, \"lumpiang Silay\", is still popular.\n\n\"Turon\", sometimes referred to as \"lumpiang saging\" (\"banana \"lumpia\"), is a sweet, deep-fried spring roll made from saba bananas and may be eaten as a snack or dessert. It also has its own subtypes, including \"manggang turon\" (mango), \"kamote turon\" (sweet potato), chocolate \"turon\", and \"ube turon\" or \"turon halaya\" (mashed purple yam).\n\nIn the Netherlands, \"lumpia\" is called \"loempia\" which was an old Indonesian spelling for \"lumpia\". It was introduced to the Netherlands through its colonial links with Indonesia. In the Netherlands, \"loempia\" is described as a large Indonesian version of Chinese spring rolls, stuffed with minced meat, bean sprouts, and cabbage leaves, and flavoured with soy sauce, garlic and green onion. Loempia is one of the popular snacks sold in Dutch snack bar or \"eetcafe\".\n\n\"Lumpia\" have such enduring popularity that one can see at least one variant in almost any set of Filipino or Indonesian festivities. Despite its Chinese origin, in United States \"lumpia\" is associated with Filipino cuisine, while in Europe, especially in the Netherlands, \"lumpia\" is associated with Indonesian cuisine, owed to their shared colonial links. The distinct taste and ease of preparation (the Shanghai variant at least) have caused \"Lumpia\" to be one of the staple food products on the menus of many Filipino restaurants in the United States.\n\n\n"}

They are usually eaten during the Spring Festival in mainland China, hence the name. Meat varieties, particularly pork, are also popular. Fried spring rolls are generally small and crisp. They can be sweet or savory; the latter are typically prepared with vegetables. They are fully wrapped before being pan-fried or deep-fried.\n\nNon-fried spring rolls are typically bigger and more savory. Unlike fried spring rolls, non-fried spring rolls are typically made by filling the wrapping with pre-cooked ingredients. Traditionally, they are a festive food eaten during the Cold Food Day festival and the Tomb Sweeping Day festival in spring to remember and pay respect to ancestors. The Hakka population sometimes also eat spring rolls on the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar (三月三 sān yuè sān). The wrappings can be a flour-based mix or batter.\n\nSpring roll is a fried dish usually available as a dim sum. They typically contain minced pork, shredded carrot, bean sprouts and other vegetables served with Worcestershire sauce.\n\nIn Taiwan, the spring rolls come in a number of varieties and often called as popiah. Popiah is popular food in many countries. In northern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally flavored with herbs, stir-fried, and sometimes topped with a finely ground peanut powder before being wrapped. The northern Taiwanese style spring rolls are usually lightly topped with or accompanied by a soy sauce. In southern Taiwan, the ingredients are generally boiled or blanched in plain water. Sometimes caster or super fine sugar is added along with the peanut powder before all the ingredients are wrapped. The most commonly eaten style of non-fried Taiwanese spring rolls is called \"rùn bǐng\" (潤餅) in Mandarin (or \"po̍h-piáⁿ\" (薄餅) in Taiwanese).\n\nSpring rolls are often eaten as snacks in the Indian sub-continent and are especially eaten during holidays such as Ramadan. In Pakistan, they are usually served with tea along with other assortments of snacks.\n\n\"Lumpia\" is the name for spring rolls in Indonesia and the Philippines, which was derived from Southern Chinese spring rolls. The name \"lumpia\" derives from Hokkien \"lunpia\" (). It is a savoury snack made of thin crepe pastry skin enveloping a mixture of savoury fillings, consists of chopped vegetables; carrots, cabbages, green beans, bamboo shoots, banana heart and leeks, or sometimes also minced meat; chicken, shrimp, pork or beef. It is often served as an appetizer or snack, and might be served deep fried or fresh (unfried).\n\nThe fried version with minced pork is called egg rolls or \"chả giò\" (southern Vietnam), \"nem cuốn\", \"chả cuốn\" or \"Nem rán\" (northern Vietnam). Central Vietnam has its own version of a fried roll called Ram. Ram is always made from whole shell-on shrimp or chopped de-shelled shrimp and some green onions, wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. Ram, like most specialty food items from central Vietnam, are not widely available in Vietnamese restaurants overseas.\n\nA Vietnamese egg roll is different from a Chinese spring roll in that it is typically smaller and contains ground or chopped meats/seafood such as pork, crab, shrimp, chicken, taro or cassava, glass noodles, wood-ear fungi or oyster mushrooms, and shredded carrots. Rice paper is always used as the wrappers. A few Vietnamese restaurants in western countries may use Chinese spring roll wrappers due to the unavailability of rice paper.\n\nSpring rolls are a Vietnamese delicacy known as gỏi cuốn. Depending on region, salad rolls were made differently. Some vegetarian families make vegetarian spring rolls rather than meat spring rolls. However, the typical ingredients include slivers of cooked pork (most often cha pork sausages), shrimp, sometimes chicken or tofu, fresh herbs like basil or cilantro, lettuce, cucumbers, sometimes fresh garlic, chives, rice vermicelli, all wrapped in moistened rice paper. A typical gỏi cuốn may contain boiled pork, boiled rice noodle, cucumber, carrot and herb only. Fresh Vietnamese spring rolls can be made at home or found at Vietnamese restaurants and some grocery stores. They are served at room temperature with dipping sauce. Nước chấm, tương xào, or a hoisin peanut sauce are all common dipping sauces. A typical hoisin dipping sauce includes chili, hoisin sauce, peanut butter and sugar. A standard nước mắm pha (nước chấm) dipping sauce is composed of fish sauce, lime, garlic, sugar, and chilies or simply fish sauce, sugar and vinegar.\n\nIn Australia, a diverse range of authentic Asian cuisine is available due to immigration, multiculturalism, and the abundant fresh local produce. Both dim sims and Chiko Rolls were inspired by Chinese spring rolls.\n\nAustralians also have their own version of a spring roll that can be found in many fish and chip shops in Australia and also bought from a supermarket (Chiko Roll). Rather than using pastry with a rolling technique they have a more doughy texture.\n\nIn Austria and Germany, deep-fried spring rolls are called \"Frühlingsrolle\", while the Vietnamese salad rolls are called \"Sommerrolle\" (\"Summer roll\"). The French call them \"nem\" for the fried ones, and \"rouleaux de printemps\" for the others. While in Poland, they are known as \"sajgonki,\" named after Saigon, the city from which many of the Vietnamese immigrants in Poland originated.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium, spring rolls are known as \"loempia,\" and are deep-fried or sometimes baked. They are thought to have been introduced by immigrants (including Chinese) from Indonesia, a former colony of the Netherlands. Loempias are filled with bean sprouts, chopped omelette, and sliced chicken or crab.\n\nIn the Nordic countries, they are known as \"vårrullar/er\",\n\nIn Argentina, spring rolls are called \"Empanaditas Chinas\", and supermarkets and Chinese restaurants sell them.\n\nIn Brazil, spring rolls are called either \"rolinhos-primavera\" (), which is an approximate free translation from English, or as it is called in Japanese restaurants and among people which are used to the plate by the way it came to Brazil from Japanese immigrants, (). They can be found mostly in Chinese restaurants, usually served with a \"molho agridoce\" (sweet and sour sauce) to dip, usually bright red and hot, made with ketchup, vinegar, sugar and sometimes spices such as star anise, which accompanies some other kinds of dishes, and can include onion and sweet pepper. Some Japanese restaurants also serve spring rolls in Brazil, but generally plain or with soy sauce to dip (\"molho agridoce\" is uncommon but also available in some). They are also found in buffet-like fast food restaurants, and can be called either by the Japanese or Brazilian Portuguese name, but most often the latter.\n\nIn Chile, spring rolls are called \"Arrollado Primavera\", and supermarkets, street vendors and Chinese restaurants sell them. (However, in other countries, \"arrollado primavera\" refers to a savory pinwheel type roll made with thin sponge cake and should not be confused with the Chilean version.)\n\nIn Costa Rica, spring rolls are called in Spanish \"Rollito de primavera\" (Little Spring Roll), but is popular known as \"Taco Chino\" and is offered in almost all the Chinese restaurants as an entree or appetizer.\n\nIn Mexico, spring rolls are called \"Rollos Primavera\", and are sold in many Chinese restaurants and fast food establishments accompanied with sweet and sour or soy sauces. In the northwest border with the US, specially in Mexicali, Baja California, the spring rolls are known as chunkun, this name could be related to the Korean chungwon (춘권), they are deep-fried and they are usually served with ketchup topped with a dot of hot mustard as dipping sauce.\n\nIn Uruguay, spring rolls are called \"Arrolladitos Primavera\", and supermarkets and Chinese restaurants sell them. They are common treat carried by catering services and usually served with a small bowl of hot soy sauce to dip them in.\n\nIn Venezuela, spring rolls are called \"Lumpia\" as in the Philippines and Indonesia. All Chinese restaurants sell them and are usually served with sweet and sour or soy sauce.\n"}

The term \"XO\" is often used in Hong Kong to denote high quality, prestige and luxury. Indeed, XO sauce has been marketed in the same manner as the French liquor, using packaging of similar colour schemes.\n\nTypical ingredients of XO sauce include dried scallop, red chili pepper, Jinhua ham, dried shrimp, garlic and canola oil. Some other recipes also call for salted cured fish and diced onion.\n\nXO sauce can be used as a table condiment or in cooking to enhance the flavour of fish, meats, vegetables, and otherwise bland foods such as tofu or noodles.

The classic dish in Sichuan cuisine originated in the Sichuan Province of south-western China and includes Sichuan peppercorns. Although the dish is found throughout China, there are regional variations that are typically less spicy than the Sichuan serving. Kung Pao chicken is also a staple of Westernized Chinese cuisine.\n\nThe dish is believed to be named after Ding Baozhen (1820–1886), a late Qing Dynasty official and governor of Sichuan Province. His title was \"Gongbao\" (). The name \"Kung Pao chicken\" is derived from this title.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the dish's name became politically incorrect because of its association with the imperial system. The dish was renamed \"fast-fried chicken cubes\" (\"hongbao jiding\") or \"chicken cubes with seared chiles\" () by Maoist radicals until its political rehabilitation in the 1980s under Deng Xiaoping's reforms.\n\nThe original Sichuan version uses chicken as its primary ingredient. In this original version, diced chicken is typically mixed with a prepared marinade. Shaoxing wine is used to enhance flavor in the marinade. The wok is seasoned and then chili peppers and Sichuan peppercorns are flash-fried to add fragrance to the oil. In Sichuan, or when preparing Sichuan-style Kung Pao chicken, only Sichuan-style chili peppers such as facing heaven pepper or seven stars pepper () are used. Smaller, thinner Sichuanese varieties may also be used. The most important component of the dish is handfuls of Sichuan peppercorns. It is these peppercorns that give authentic Kung Pao chicken its distinctive numbing flavor. Use of hot and numbing flavor () is a typical element of Sichuan cooking. Then the chicken is stir-fried and chopped leeks, along with peanuts, are added. Kung Pao chicken starts off with fresh, moist, unroasted peanuts. These are often used instead of their pre-roasted versions. The peanuts are dropped into the hot oil at the bottom of the wok, then deep-fried until golden brown before the other ingredients are added.\n\nVariants exist that use other meats in place of chicken, such as \"Kung Pao shrimp\" () and \"Kung Pao frog legs\" () \n\nVersions commonly found in the West, called \"Kung Pao chicken\", \"Kung Po\", or just \"chicken chili and garlic\", consist of diced, marinated chicken, stir-fried with orange or orange juice, ginger, garlic, chicken broth, sugar, cooking oil, corn starch, and salt and pepper to taste.

Common ingredients in the modern version include beef heart, tongue and tripe, and a generous amount of various spices, including Sichuan pepper. True to its Sichuan roots, the desired taste should be both spicy and mouth-numbing. Despite its name, actual lung is rarely used.\n\nAs early as the late Qing dynasty, many vendors were already selling beef slices served cold in the streets of Chengdu, using beef offal because they were relatively inexpensive. Because of its low cost, the dish was popular among rickshaw pullers and poor students.\n\nIn the 1930s, a married couple in Chengdu became famous for making beef slices. The husband, Guo Zhaohua (郭朝華), and wife, Zhang Tianzheng (張田政), were particular about the beef slices they made, and often experimented with new ingredients. As a result, their beef slices had a distinct taste from the other beef slice vendors, and their business boomed. Often though, mischievous children would pull a prank on the couple, and stick paper notes that read \"fuqi feipian\" (\"husband and wife lung pieces\") on their backs, and sometimes people would yell the words out. Later on, a merchant tried the \"fuqi feipian\" and was so satisfied, he gave them a gold-lettered plaque that read \"fuqi feipian\", and the name has stuck ever since.\n\nTo suit their customers' tastes, the couple made many improvements on the dish, and offal slices were eventually replaced by various beef or lamb slices. Many people still preferred calling the dish \"fuqi feipian\", thus the name is still used today.\n\nThe meaning of \"fei\" was originally waste parts or offal (廢) but later changed to lung (肺) so the dish sounded less repulsive. The lung could be a part of this offal, but \"fei\" is not lung by itself in this dish's meaning.\n\n\n"}

It is often served with seafood or meze. It is comparable to several other alcoholic beverages available around the Mediterranean and the Middle East, e.g. pastis, ouzo, sambuca, arak and aguardiente.\n\nIn Crete \"tsikoudia\" is a pomace brandy that is sometimes called \"rakı\" but made from grapes. It is used to make \"rakomelo\" which is flavored with honey and cinnamon. (Rakomelo is served warm during winter months).\n\nThe term \"raki\" entered English from Turkish \"rakı\". The Arabic word \"arak\" (Arabic عرق ), means \"distilled\", other variants being \"araka\", \"araki\", \"ariki\".\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, until the 19th century, meyhanes run by Rûm (Greeks) and Albanians would mainly serve wine along with meze, due to religious restrictions imposed by various sultans. Although there were many Muslims among meyhane attendants, the authorities could, at times, prosecute them. With the relatively liberal atmosphere of the Tanzimat period (1839–1876), meyhane attendance among Muslims rose considerably, and raki became a favorite among meyhane-goers. By the end of the century, raki took its current standard form and its consumption surpassed that of wine.\n\nDuring this period, rakı was produced by distillation of grapes pomace (\"cibre\") obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added. If aniseed was not added, it would take the name \"düz rakı\" (\"straight rakı\"), whereas rakı prepared with the addition of gum mastic was named \"sakız rakısı\" (gum rakı) or \"mastikha\".\n\nWith the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the modern-day Republic of Turkey, grape-based rakı began to be distilled by the state-owned spirits monopoly Tekel, with the first factory production taking place in 1944 in Izmir. With increasing sugar beet production, Tekel also began to distill the alcohol from molasses, and a new brand of raki made from sugar-beet alcohol was introduced under the name \"Yeni Rakı\" (\"New Rakı\"). Molasses gave \"Yeni Rakı\" a distinctive bitter taste and helped increase the drink's popularity.\n\nToday, with increased competition from the private sector, and the privatization of Tekel in 2004, several new brands and types of raki have emerged, each with its own distinct composition and production method, although the overall qualities of the drink have generally been kept consistent. These include \"Efe Rakı\", \"Çilingir Rakı\", \"Mercan Rakı\", \"Fasıl Rakı\", \"Burgaz Rakı\", \"Ata Rakı\", and \"Anadolu Rakı\". \"Sarı Zeybek Rakısı\", another recent brand, is aged in oak casks, which gives it a distinctive golden colour.\n\nRaki is traditionally produced from raisin/grape spirit called \"suma\" that is distilled to a maximum of 94.55% abv, This spirit is not highly rectified spirit and unlike other flavored spirits Raki producers consider that the \"suma\" has an important role to play in the flavor of Raki itself.\n\nThe \"suma\", or \"suma\" mixed with highly rectified spirit, is diluted with water re-distilled with aniseed and the spirit is collected at around 79-80% \"abv\". The flavored distillate is diluted and sweetened and rested for minimum of 30 days prior to sale in order to allow the flavors to harmonize.\n\nIn Turkey, rakı is the national drink and is traditionally consumed with chilled water on the side or partly mixed with chilled water, according to personal preference. Rakı is rarely consumed without the addition of water. Ice cubes are often added. Dilution with water causes rakı to turn a milky-white colour, similar to the louche of absinthe. This phenomenon has resulted in the drink being popularly referred to \"aslan sütü\" (\"lion's milk\"). Since \"aslan\" (\"lion\") is a Turkish colloquial metaphor for a strong, courageous man, this gives the term a meaning close to \"the milk for the strong.\"\n\nRakı is commonly consumed alongside meze, a selection of hot and cold appetizers, as well as at a \"rakı sofrası\" (\"rakı table\"), either before a full dinner or instead of it. It is especially popular with seafood, together with fresh arugula, beyaz peynir and melon. It is an equally popular complement to various red meat dishes like kebabs, where it is sometimes served with a glass of şalgam.\n\nThe founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was very fond of rakı, and his late-night \"rakı sofrası\" sessions were his favorite place to debate issues with his closest friends and advisors.\n\nStandard rakı is a grape product, though it may be produced from figs as well. Rakı produced from figs, particularly popular in the southern provinces of Turkey, is called \"incir boğması\", \"incir rakısı\" (\"fig rakı\"), or in Arabic, \"tini\". Tekel ceased producing fig rakı in 1947.\n\nThere are two methods of Turkish rakı production. One method uses raisins and other grapes. \"Yeni Rakı\" is produced from raisins and \"Tekirdağ Rakısı\" is produced from grapes. Fresh grape rakı is like ouzo but has a higher alcohol content.\n\nSuma rakı, i.e. distilled rakı prior to the addition of aniseed, is generally produced from raisins but raki factories around established wine-producing areas like Tekirdağ, Nevşehir, and İzmir may also use fresh grapes for higher quality. Recently, \"yaş üzüm rakısı\" (\"fresh-grape raki\") has become more popular in Turkey. The maker of a recent brand, \"Efe Rakı\", was the first company to produce raki exclusively of fresh grape suma, called \"Efe Yaş Üzüm Rakısı\" (Efe Fresh Grape Raki). \"Tekirdağ Altın Seri\" (Tekirdağ Golden Series) followed the trend and many others have been produced by other companies.\n\nThe best-known and popular brands of rakı, however, remain \"Yeni Rakı\", originally produced by Tekel, which transferred production rights to Mey Alkol upon the 2004 privatization of Tekel, and \"Tekirdağ Rakısı\" from the region of Tekirdağ, which is famous for its characteristic flavour, believed to be due to the artesian waters of Çorlu used in its production. \"Yeni Rakı\" has an alcohol content of 45% and 1.5 grams of aniseed per liter; \"Tekirdağ Rakısı\" is 45% ABV and has 1.7 grams of aniseed per liter. There are also two top-quality brands called \"Kulüp Rakısı\" and \"Altınbaş\", each with 50% ABV.\n\n\"Dip rakısı\" (\"bottom rakı\") is the rakı that remains in the bottom of the tanks during production. Bottom rakı is thought to best capture the dense aroma and flavour of the spirit, and is also called \"özel rakı\" (\"special raki\"). It is not generally available commercially; instead, rakı factories reserve it as a prestigious gift for large clients.\n\nAniseed-flavoured Rakı, has been celebrated as a festival in Adana and Northern Cyprus since 2010. World Rakı Festival in Adana, emerged from a hundred-year tradition of enjoying Adana kebab, with liver, şalgam and rakı. The event turned into a nationwide popular street festival, street musicians playing drums and zurna, entertain visitors all night long at the second Saturday night of every December. North Cyprus Rakı Festival is a week long festival taking place in Girne, Lefkoşa and Gazi Magosa.\n\nIn Crete \"tsikoudia\" is a pomace brandy that is sometimes called \"rakı\" but made from grapes. It is used to make \"rakomelo\", which is flavored with honey and cinnamon and is served warm during winter months.\n\n\n"}

It is similar to blancmange.\n\nThe name \"tofu\" here refers to \"tofu-like solid\"; soy beans, which are the main ingredient of tofu, are not used.

The almond milk is extracted, sweetened, and heated with a gelling agent (usually agar). When chilled, the almond milk mixture solidifies to the consistency of a soft gelatin dessert.\n\nAlthough the agar-based recipe is vegan, there are numerous nontraditional recipes that are not. Most are based on dairy products and a small amount of flavored extract. Gelatin is also a common substitute for agar.\n\nAlmond jelly can be made from scratch or using instant mix. There is an instant soy-based powder with a coagulating agent, which dissolves in hot water and solidifies upon cooling. One popular brand of mix is DoFu Delight.\n\n\n"}

The word \"turşu\" is ultimately derived from Persian \"tursh\", which means 'sour'. In Turkic languages such as Turkish and Azerbaijani it is spelled turşu.\n\nTorshi is common in varieties of Middle Eastern cuisine such as Arab cuisine, Turkish cuisine, and Iranian cuisine. Iran boasts a great variation of hundreds of different types of torshi according to regional customs and different events. In some families, no meal is considered complete without a bowl of torshi on the table. In Bulgarian cuisine, the most popular types are \"tsarska turshiya\" (\"king's pickle\") and \"selska turshiya\" (\"country pickle\"). \"Toursi\" is a traditional appetizer (\"meze\") to go with arak, rakı, ouzo, tsipouro, and rakia. In some regions the torshi water (turşu suyu) is also drinkable and very popular in Turkey.\n\nMaking torshi at home is still a widespread tradition during the autumn months, even in cities. Torshi is often served in restaurants or it can be bought ready to eat from supermarkets.\n\nTorshi is made with garlic, chili peppers, celery, cauliflower, carrots, beets, shallots, cabbage, aubergines (eggplant) and other vegetables, and dried aromatic herbs pickled in vinegar or brandy, salt, and different spice mixtures, which usually include whole black peppercorns, ginger, etc. Persian style torshi includes more vinegar, while Turkish style turşu includes more salt as an antibacterial agent.\n\n\"Torshi Liteh\" is made with eggplants and herbs (parsley, coriander, mint, tarragon, basil). Eggplants are baked in the oven, put in a glass jar with herbs and vinegar, and stored in a cool, dry place for two to three months.\n\n\"Tsarska turshiya\" is made with cauliflower, red peppers, carrots, and celery. The vegetables are mixed with some salt and sugar and left overnight. The next day the juice is mixed with vinegar and boiled for several minutes. The vegetables are put in glass jars and pressed down with cherry twigs and a round river stone, then the jars are filled with the cooled pickle marinade.\n\n\"Selska turshiya\" is made with green peppers, green tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, and celery.

{"id": "47837676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47837676", "title": "Pork rind", "text": "Pork rind\n\nPork rind is the culinary term for the skin of a pig. It can be used in many different ways.\n\nIt can be fried or roasted in pork fat (lard) to produce the snack called pork rinds in American English and pork greaves, pork scratchings, or pork cracklings in the UK (although \"crackling\" may instead refer to the rind on a roasted pork joint). The frying renders much of the fat attached to the uncooked rind, causing the size of the cooked product to be reduced considerably.\n\nOften a byproduct of the rendering of lard, it is also a way of making even the tough skin of a pig edible. In many ancient cultures, animal fats were the only way of obtaining oil for cooking and they were common in many people's diets until the industrial revolution made vegetable oils more common and more affordable.\n\nMicrowaveable pork rinds are sold in bags that resemble microwaveable popcorn and can be eaten still warm. Pickled pork rinds, though, are often enjoyed refrigerated and cold. Unlike the crisp and fluffy texture of fried pork rinds, pickled pork rinds are very rich and buttery, much like \"foie gras\".\n\nFor the large-scale production of commercial pork rinds, frozen, dried pork skin pellets are used. They are first rehydrated in water with added flavoring, and then fried in pork fat at . Cooking makes the rinds expand and float on the oil surface. The rinds are then removed from the fat, flavored, and air dried. Antioxidants may be added to improve stability.\n\nLike many snack foods, pork rinds can be high in sodium and fat; however, they are low in carbohydrates and are sometimes considered an alternative snack food for those following the Atkins diet. According to \"Men's Health\", a serving contains nine times the protein and less fat than is found in a serving of potato chips, which are much higher in carbohydrates. They add that 43% of pork rind's fat is unsaturated, and most of that is oleic acid, the same healthy fat found in olive oil. Another 13% of its fat content is stearic acid, a type of saturated fat that is considered harmless because it does not raise cholesterol levels. A 60 g serving of pork rind contains 29 g of fat, 375 kcal and 0.65g of sodium. However, pork rinds are considered an incomplete source of protein because they contain very low amounts of some essential amino acids, including methionine, tryptophan, and histidine.\n\n\"Torresmo\", also known as \"toicinho de porco\", is a popular bar snack in Brazil, usually served in bite-sized chunks. It is also a common accompaniment to typical dishes such as \"feijoada\" and \"virado\".\n\n\"Chicharrones\" is the term for pork rinds in Colombia. Two kinds of \"chicharrón\" exist: \"chicharrón toteado\" (exploded pork crackling), which has no meat in it and is similar to the lighter, commercial version, and \"chicharrón cocho\", which is usually made with part of the pork meat attached to the skin. This makes for a crispy skin and a soft, juicy meat. It is traditionally served with beans, rice, fried eggs, avocado, and plantain in a typical plate called \"bandeja paisa\".\n\n\"Scrunchions\" is a Newfoundland term for small pieces of pork rind or pork fatback fried until rendered and crispy. They are often used as a flavoring over other foods, such as salt fish and potatoes, and mainly used as a condiment for fish and brewis.\n\nIn Quebec, they are often called \"oreilles de Christ\" (Christ ears) and are eaten almost exclusively as part of traditional \"cabane à sucre\" meals.\n\n\"Chicharrones \"are commonly served in homes or snack in bars and restaurants, little sodas (small restaurants with home-cooking flavor business) also adds in their menu or\" empanadas\" with \"chicharrones\" and famous snack dish called .\nPreparation could change from using pig fat as base, boiling and later frying, but many prefer using a wok-like pot and wood-fire cooking.\n\nMexico is one of the world's largest producers and consumers of pork rinds, known as \"chicharrón\" or \"chicharra\". It may still have fat attached, called in Spanish \"chicharrón con gordo\" in central México.\n\nIt is commonly served in homes across Mexico. It can be served in a soup sometimes called \"chicharrón con chile\" (pork rind with chili sauce) or \"salsa de chicharrón\" (pork rind sauce). It is often served as an appetizer, or even offered as snack at family reunions. However, \"chicharrones\" can be purchased on the street and are usually eaten with hot sauce and lime juice.\n\nOne popular breakfast is \"salsa de chicharron\", (also \"chicharrón con chile\" or just \"chicharrón\" in some regions) cooked in green tomato or tomato salsa spiced with epazote. If liquid is drained, the pork rind can be used in tacos, either as fast-food products or kitchen made.\n\nThe dryness in pork rind pairs perfectly with humidity and softness in \"pico de gallo\" (diced tomato, avocado, onion, cilantro [coriander leaf], and chili mix) and both fill perfectly a corn tortilla as taco.\n\nA byproduct in frying rinds is the decanted residues in fryer called \"asiento\" or \"boronas\" (grounds). The process requires uniformly cooking rinds, and while the product dehydrates, it cracks, losing small pieces, which are collected afterwards and become a thick, fatty salsa, that can be mixed as an ingredient in other\" salsa de chicharrón \"recipes or used for its flavor and fat in pan frying. A second byproduct in frying rinds is lard.\n\n\"Cueritos\" are the same as pork rinds, but are soft, chewy, and translucent, as they are not heavily cooked unlike the\" chicharrón\", which is very crispy. They are easily available in Mexico as \"antojo\" and sold on the streets, usually by butchers, oftentimes served fresh, but one can also find them marinated with vinegar and onion at \"tienditas\", popular convenience stores where the clerk is usually the owner. If marinated, they are served with lemon and salt, powdered chili and probably with \"salsa Valentina\".\n\nAnother vatiety is \"duritos\", also called \"chicharrones de harina\". These are similar to traditional \"chicharrones\", only made with fried flour leavened with baking soda, instead of fried pig skin. This variety also features a pinwheel shape. Like \"cueritos\", this food is popular with street vendors. They are infrequently sold in Mexico, but tend to be a Mexican-American version of the popular\" chicharron\". \n\nIn the Yucatan cuisine, it is often served along pork belly, known locally by the Maya word \"kastakán\", blood sausage, and a spiced sausage made from pork entrails and habanero peppers known as \"buche\".\n\nPork rinds, sometimes cracklings, is the American name for fried or roasted skins of pigs, geese or other animals, regardless of the status or amount of pork in the snack. Pieces of fried meat, skin, or membrane produced as a byproduct of rendering lard are also called cracklings. Cracklings consist of either roasted or fried pork rind that has had salt rubbed into it and scored with a sharp knife: \"a crackling offers a square of skin that cracks when you bite into it, giving way to a little pocket of hot fat and a salty layer of pork meat.\"\n\nCajun cracklings (or \"cracklins\") from Cajun cuisine (called \"gratons\" in Louisiana French), are fried pieces of pork fat with a small amount of attached skin, flavored after frying with a mixture of peppery Cajun spices.\n\nPork rinds normally refers to a snack food commercially sold in plastic bags. They are made in a two-step process: pork skin is first rendered and dried, and then fried and puffed. These are also called by the Spanish name, \"chicharrón\", a term from Latin America.\n\nPork rinds sold in the United States are occasionally stained with a pink or purple spot. These edible marks are actually USDA stamps used on the skins to mark that they have been inspected. They are not harmful.\n\nIn 2003, sales of pork rinds experienced rapid growth, but they have dropped \"by $31 million since 2004, when they reached $134 million, and now make up barely more than 1% of the salty snack market.\"\n\n\"脂渣\" (\"zhizha\") is made from pork, and are extremely popular in and only popularized in Qingdao, Shandong. It is a byproduct of lard. Lard is usually sold around US$1, but \"zhizha\" may be sold for about $30-40 and \"huazhi\" for around $10\n\"精肉脂渣\" (\"zhizha\"): The skin is removed and sliced as thin as a gold coin. After the extraction of lard, the rest is hard and tastes like a salty cracker, seasoned with salt and MSG while it is hot.\n\"花脂\" (\"huazhi\"): This is made from intestines, chopped and deep-fried twice, and used in stew or soup.\n\n\"Chicharon\" (derived from the Spanish \"chicharrón\"; also spelled \"tsitsaron\") is usually bought from \"balut\" vendors as \"pulutan\" (i.e. appetizer dishes usually eaten with alcoholic beverages). It is also available in grocery stores, supermarkets, outdoor markets, sidewalk food vendors, and \"sari-sari\" stores (small, home made stores). \"Chicharon\" is prepared by deep-frying dried pork rinds and seasoning with salt. It is usually eaten with vinegar, hot vinegar (chopped chilies and/or soy sauce are added), or with \"bagoong\", \"lechon\" liver sauce, or \"atchara\" (pickled green papaya). \"Chicharong manok\", which is made from chicken skin, and \"chicharong bulaklak\" (literally 'flower chicharrón', from its distinctive shape) made of pig intestine, are also popular. It is also used as a topping for pancit palabok and pancit malabon and in preparing pork sisig.\n\n\"Khaep mu\" (, ), as crispy pork rinds are known in Thai cuisine, are a speciality of the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai. One way of making \"khaep mu\" is to first cure the pork skin, with an attached layer of fat, in salt for several days, after which it is soaked in water for a couple of hours. This ensures that the fat cells will expand, resulting in a \"puffed skin\" after cooking. The slabs of belly fat are then slowly cooked at a low heat in, preferably, lard but other animal fat and vegetable oil can also be used. Similar to a confit, the pork thus treated can be stored. The pork is then cut into smaller pieces and baked in an oven until perfectly crispy. Another method of making the pork rinds again involves salting the pork skin, but instead of soaking it, the skin is hung out to dry in the sun after which it is sliced and deep-fried twice. Yet another way to make this dish in Thailand is to first cut the pork skin into strips, then boil them in water after which they are thoroughly dried before being deep-fried.\n\nNorthern Thai people most often eat pork rinds together with different Thai chili pastes, such as \"nam phrik num\" (made with grilled green chili peppers) and \"nam phrik ong\" (made with dried chili peppers, tomato and minced pork). It can also be eaten as a snack, either on its own, or with \"nam chim khaep mu\", a dipping sauce made with lime juice, fresh chili peppers and a sweet chili paste. It can also figure as an accompaniment to Thai dishes such as Nam ngiao and the famous Thai salad \"som tam\" or used crushed as an ingredient, for instance in \"sa makhuea\", a northern Thai salad made with minced pork and Thai eggplant.\n\nPork rinds used to be a very common food in Vietnam before the Doi moi program in 1986. Due to various economic difficulties in the pre-Doi moi era, cooking oil and meat were still considered \"luxury goods\", and consequently fat liquid and pork rind became excellent replacements in Vietnamese daily meals. Nowadays with a better economic situation for the country, pork rind is no longer a substitute food, but rather a special component in many Vietnamese dishes, such as \"cơm tấm\", noodle and snails (\"bún ốc\"), noodle soup, etc. In Vietnamese, pork rind is called \"\", which translates to \"dried piece of fat\".\n\nIn most Slavic countries they are known as \"\" (as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia), \"\" (as in Russia or Ukraine), or \" Čvarci\" (as in Serbia or Bosnia). Often they are mixed with lard as a type of spread, and served with bread. They are particularly popular in this form during celebrations when alcohol is to be consumed.\n\nThey are part of the traditional dish \"bramborové knedlíky se škvarkama a kyselým zelím\", potato dumplings with cracklings and sauerkraut. See the picture.\n\nIn Hungary, they are called \"tepertő\" and is usually served with salt and bread, sometimes vegetables. It's consumption is at its peak during the season of pig slaughter, as it is then when pork rind is at its freshest. It is usually consumed as breakfast or dinner meal.\n\nIn Romania they are known as \"\". The outer layer of a pig's skin, known as \"\", is usually served with salt and cut in thin slices of a few millimeters.\n\nIn Catalonia, a llardó is each of the pieces of fried animal fat (specially of pork) that remain after pressing to extract the lard, so that they are golden and crunchy. They are sold by weight in salumerias in Catalonia, and in the Carnival time they are often also found in pastries. The llardó is used as an appetizer, as a snack, and is essential to make the coca de llardons, a cake typical in Catalonia during different festivals. Some salumerias use them to make egg butifarras, since in Barcelona both products are strongly associated to Fat Thursday.\n\nPork scratchings is the British name for deep-fried, salted, crunchy pork rind with fat produced separately from the meat. This is then eaten cold. Pork scratchings typically are heavy and hard, have a crispy layer of fat under the skin, and are flavored only with salt. The pig hair is usually removed by quickly burning the skin of the pig before it is cut into pieces and cooked in hot fat. In comparison, Crackling is distinguished from normal pork rind in the United Kingdom by the fact that it is cut from a freshly-roasted joint of pork (Usually a Pork loin or Pork chops) after the meat has finished cooking and is usually served warm or hot, before the fat on the underside of the roasted skin can finish cooling down and re-solidifying.\n\nPork scratchings are sold as a snack food, and common brands include Mr. Porky, Big D, Uncle Albert, Jays, and Midland Snacks. Unlike the physically large, but relatively light bags of deep-fried skin without the fat sold around the world, in the UK they are sold in relatively small bags which usually weigh between 42 g and 90 g. and are eaten as an accompaniment to a pint of beer in a pub, just like crisps or peanuts. Scratchings can also be bought from butchers, supermarkets or newsagents. They have been taken to both the North and South Poles on various expeditions, because of their high energy content.\n\nThere are three distinct types. Traditional scratchings are made from shank rind and cooked just once. Pork crackling is also made from shoulder rind, but is fried twice. It is first rendered at a low heat, and then cooked at a higher temperature for a less fatty, crispier result, or cut from roasted pork joints to produce heavier but less fatty results. A more recent development is the pork crunch, which is made from back rind and again double-fried to become a large, puffy snack. Some supermarkets now sell just the layer of skin and fat (no meat), in a raw form for home grilling or roasting, or cooked and ready to eat from hot food counters. The term \"crackling\" is also often applied to a twice-cooked variety of pork scratchings.\n\n"}

According to Peter Hessler (Beijing correspondent for \"The New Yorker\" and former Peace Corps teacher), \"In most parts of Sichuan, you can walk into a restaurant and order \"chaoshou\" without making a sound. Cross your arms and they will understand exactly what you want.\" One native speaker claims the Sichuan-only name for these dumplings may have originated at one time by a dialectic transposition, i.e. \"chao shou\" was originally \"shou chao\", meaning \"hand-folded\".\n\nVariations on this dish are available in many Chinese restaurants in the United States, with the name on the English menu being \"Won Ton with Spice Sauce\" or similar.\n\nMary Chung's restaurant (鍾園川菜館, Pinyin: \"Zhōngyuán Chuāncàiguǎn\") in Cambridge, Massachusetts serves a dish called \"Suan La Chow Show\", which are dumplings in a spicy soy ginger sauce on top of a bed of raw mung bean sprouts. This popular dish is different from the \"suan la chao shou\" described by Fuchsia Dunlop, who studied at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine in Chengdu. Although somewhat similar, Dunlop's recipe includes a substantial amount of black vinegar in the sauce, making it much more sour.\n\nA local restaurant reviewer noted the first version of the dish was introduced to Cambridge as Shanghai street food by a restaurant called Colleen's Chinese Cuisine, owned by Colleen Fong, a friend of Mary Chung's, in the 1970s. Other Chinese restaurants around Cambridge, Massachusetts serve this version of the dish, and it appears to be a somewhat popular local variation. Mary Chung's version of Suan La Chow Show was featured by the Gentleman Gourmand on the Boston episode of The Hungry Detective television show.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47837702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47837702", "title": "Mala sauce", "text": "Mala sauce\n\nMala sauce is a popular oily, spicy, and numbing Chinese sauce which consists of Sichuan peppercorn, chili pepper and various spices simmered with oil.\n\nRegarded as a regional dish for Chongqing cuisine and Sichuan cuisine, it has become one of the most popular sauces in Chinese cuisine and spawned many regional variants.\n\nThe term \"málà\" is a combination of two Chinese characters: \"numbing\" (麻) and \"spicy (picant)\" (辣), referring to the feeling in the mouth after eating the sauce.\n\nThe numbness is caused by Sichuan pepper, which contains 3% hydroxy-alpha-sanshool.\n\nThe precise origins of the dish are unclear, but many sources attribute its development to night markets in Chongqing that targeted pier workers in the 19th to 20th century. The strong flavour and thick layer of oil helps preserve foods and removes the unpopular smells of the cheap foods, such as solidified blood, beef stomach and kidney, which were usually served to pier workers.\n\nDespite the strong flavour by itself, various dipping sauces are often served to make the texture of cooked meat smooth and oily, and the tastes more complex. Common sauces include sesame oil with garlic, oyster oil, or doufu ru.\n\nThe sauce is used in a variety of ways, from stir-fry, stews, and soup, to being used in hot pot or as a dipping sauce. In the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces mala powder (麻辣粉; pinyin: málàfĕn) is used on snacks and street foods, such as stinky tofu, fried potatoes, and barbecued meat and vegetables.\n\nThe sauce is made primarily of dried chili peppers, chili powder, douban paste, Sichuan peppercorns, clove, garlic, star anise, black cardamom, fennel, ginger, cinnamon, salt and sugar. These ingredients are simmered with beef tallow and vegetable oil for many hours, and packed into a jar. Other herbs and spices, such as sand ginger, \"Angelica\" \"dahurica\" and poppy seeds, can be added to create a unique flavour.\n\nTraditionally, a restaurant hired a chef specializing in making this sauce; the recipes were kept secret to the chef himself. Today, prepared mala sauce can easily be found in supermarkets, and chain restaurants often produce their own sauce on a large scale, while many others still blend their own one. Like curry, there is a constant debate about the 'best' recipe and numerous variations are available on the market.\n\nMala sauce can be adapted in many dishes. Mala-sao-kao (麻辣烧烤) is eaten with barbecued pork, squid, shrimp, chicken, sausage, orinji mushroom, enoki mushroom and corn with spicy sauce. Chinese also use Mala sauce to cook grilled, fried or stir-fried noodles. It will come in the dishes of blanched meat in soup (麻辣烫 Mala-tang) and hot pot (麻辣火锅 Mala-huo-guo). Mala soup can be made from spices but in China, there are Mala cubes that can be dissolved in the hot water immediately.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47837761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47837761", "title": "Mapo doufu", "text": "Mapo doufu\n\nMapo Doufu () is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan province. It consists of tofu set in a spicy sauce, typically a thin, oily, and bright red suspension, based on douban 豆瓣 (fermented broadbean and chili paste) and douchi 豆豉 (fermented black beans), along with minced meat, usually pork or beef. Variations exist with other ingredients such as water chestnuts, onions, other vegetables, or wood ear fungus.\n\n\"Ma\" stands for \"ma-zi\" (Chinese: mázi, 麻子) which means pockmarks. \"Po\" is the first syllable of \"popo\" (Chinese: 婆婆, pópo) which means an old woman or grandma. Hence, mapo is an old woman whose face is pockmarked. It is thus sometimes translated as \"pockmarked grandma's beancurd\".\n\nAccording to \"Mrs. Chiang's Szechwan Cookbook\": \"Eugene Wu, the Librarian of the Harvard Yenching Library, grew up in Chengdu and claims that as a schoolboy he used to eat Pock-Marked Ma's Bean Curd or \"mapo doufu\", at a restaurant run by the original Pock-Marked Ma herself. One ordered by weight, specifying how many grams of bean curd and meat, and the serving would be weighed out and cooked as the diner watched. It arrived at the table fresh, fragrant, and so spicy hot, or \"la\", that it actually caused sweat to break out.\"\n\nIn Japan, the dish was introduced and popularized by the Sino-Japanese chef Chen Kenmin. His son, Chen Kenichi, made it more popular as it was his trademark dish on the television program \"Iron Chef\".\n\nAuthentic mapo doufu is powerfully spicy with both conventional \"heat\" spiciness and the characteristic \"mala\" (numbing spiciness) flavor of Sichuan cuisine. The feel of the particular dish is often described by cooks using seven specific Chinese adjectives: 麻 (numbing), 辣 (spicy hot), 烫 (hot temperature), 鲜 (fresh), 嫩 (tender and soft), 香 (aromatic), and 酥 (flaky). The authentic form of the dish is increasingly easy to find outside China today, but usually only in Sichuanese restaurants that do not adapt the dish for non-Sichuanese tastes.\n\nThe most important and necessary ingredients in the dish that give it the distinctive flavour are chili broad bean paste (salty bean paste) from Sichuan's Pixian county (郫县豆瓣酱), fermented black beans, chili oil, chili flakes of the heaven-facing pepper (朝天辣椒), Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, green onions, and rice wine. Supplementary ingredients include water or stock, sugar (depending on the saltiness of the bean paste brand used), and starch (if it is desired to thicken the sauce).\n\nMapo doufu can also be found in restaurants in other Chinese provinces as well as in Japan and Korea where the flavor is adapted to local tastes. In the west, the dish is often greatly changed, with its spiciness severely toned down to widen its appeal. This happens particularly in Chinese restaurants not specialising in Sichuan cuisine. In American Chinese cuisine, the dish is often made without meat to appeal to vegetarians, using shiitakes or other edible mushrooms as substitutes to meat, as with very little spice, a thick sweet-and-sour sauce, and added vegetables, a stark contrast from the original dish. \n\n"}
{"id": "47837775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47837775", "title": "Jinhua ham", "text": "Jinhua ham\n\nJinhua ham is a type of dry-cured ham named after the city of Jinhua, where it is produced, in the Zhejiang province of eastern China. The ham is used in Chinese cuisines to flavour stewed and braised foods as well as for making the stocks and broths of many Chinese soups. The ham was awarded first prize in the 1915 Panama International Merchandise Exhibition. It is a well-known ham in China.\n\nJinhua ham is traditionally produced using the hind legs of a breed of pigs native to China known as the \"two ends black\" (兩頭烏), which have black hair growing on their heads and hindquarters with white midsections. This breed is quick to mature, has excellent meat quality, and thin skin. Ham production begins when air temperatures drops below . The process takes approximately 8 to 10 months to complete.\n\nHam production is separated into six stages, starting in the winter and ending the following autumn:\n\nNew processing techniques involving adjustments in aging temperature and humidity to accelerate production and reduce the time down to 1–2 months.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of the Jinhua ham processing technique is during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), and this method of dry ham production is reported by some to have been in turn transmitted to Europe by Marco Polo. The name \"Jinhua\" was bestowed by the first emperor of the southern Song dynasty. It is highly regarded in Chinese cuisine, and may be eaten as part of a cold meat dish or used in producing soup stock, imparting its unique and umami flavour to any dish. Jinhua ham is an important ingredient in the dish \"Buddha jumps over the wall\". The ham has been lauded in Chinese literature, and was prominently featured in the Qing dynasty novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", when the cuisine of the nobility was being described.\n\nThe ideal ham should have certain physical characteristics, such as shiny and smooth yellow outside, a rounded shape in the style of a bamboo leaf, small joint and hoof, a thin and slender bone, an abundant layer of fat surrounding dark and red toned meat, a pronounced but not unpleasant odour, a fine textured meat with high levels of intramuscular fat, and a taste that is highly salty, umami, and sweet. The outside of the ham may have small amounts of mould, but this is considered normal and thought to contribute to the flavour of the ham.\n\nThe taste of Jinhua ham arises from the high concentration of free amino acids and nucleotides in the ham, more specifically glutamic acid and 5'-inosinic acid. Although the total amount of amino acids is not different from the uncured ham, the high proportion of the free compounds from the long curing process allows for the highly umami taste of the ham. The taste is also contributed by fermentation due largely to the moulds and some yeasts present on the ham.\n\nThe aroma and the aroma compounds of Jinhua ham are similar to that of dry-cured Iberian hams but different from light Italian and Parma hams. This is likely due to the longer aging and environmental exposure of both Jinhua and Iberian hams. The fragrant compounds consist of aldehydes, sulfur compounds such as methanethiol and dimethyl disulfide, and branched alkenes, which are derived from the breakdown and rearrangement of amino acids and fatty acids caused by auto-oxidation and fermentation.\n\nIn 2003, Jinhua ham was the center of a controversial food safety incident in China. In the incident, several small producers of Jinhua hams operated out of season and produced hams during warmer months, treating their hams with pesticides to prevent spoilage and insect infestation. The hams were soaked in the pesticide dichlorvos, which is a volatile organophosphate insecticide used for fumigation. The incident strongly affected legitimate makers of the ham and caused a sharp drop-off in the market demand.\n\n\nChinese hams\n\n"}

The preparation of this dish usually involves some sort of meat (usually it is beef or fish), chili pepper, and a large amount of vegetable oil.\n\nThe meat is prepared with water, starch, and a slight amount of salt. Boiled vegetables are placed at the bottom of the serving bowl or dish. The prepared raw meat is poached in water that is heated to boiling point for 20–30 seconds, just enough to remove rawness yet preserving the meat's tenderness. Then it is drained and put in the serving dish with vegetables. Minced dried chili, sichuan pepper, minced garlic, and other seasoning are spread over the meat. Vegetable oil is heated in a pan nearly to smoking point, then poured over the prepared meat and vegetable.\n\nThis dish maintains tenderness of the meat by poaching it instead of stir frying. It offers a good combination of tender meat, freshness of vegetable, hot spicy flavor of chili pepper, and numbing sensation of Sichuan pepper.\n\n"}

It is made from basic cookie ingredients of flour, sugar, egg whites and butter rolled out thinly and then shaped into a hollow cylinder or a cone. It was traditionally sold by roadside vendors known as \"barquilleros\" that carry a characteristic red roulette tin (the \"ruleta de barquillero\"). It was introduced to Latin America and the Philippines during colonial times. In Spain and former Spanish colonies, barquillos are commonly regarded as a type of Christmas cookie. It is also popular during various fiestas. It spread to neighboring countries and today are extremely popular in East and Southeast Asian countries. \n\nThe Spanish name \"barquillo\" means \"little boat\". It is derived from the ancient tradition of heating the biscuits in convex or boat-shaped molds. Barquillos are also known by a variety of names. In English it is also known as biscuit roll, cookie roll, crispy biscuit roll, egg roll, crisp biscuit roll, or love letter. The Chinese name for this snack, \"蛋卷\", can be directly translated into English as \"egg roll\". However, the food item known in the West as egg roll is very different.\n\nBarquillos are thin wafers made from flour, sugar, egg whites and butter that is rolled into the shape of a long hollow tube or a cone. They can also be sold simply folded over twice in a fan shape. \nIn Spain, it was traditionally sold by roaming roadside vendors known as \"barquilleros\" (or \"barquilleras\") during festive events. In Madrid, barquilleros are particularly associated with the fiesta of San Isidro Labrador, where the vendors typically dress in \"castizo\" (\"chulapo\") attire. \n\nBarquilleros carry a characteristic red tin known as the \"ruleta de barquillero\" which has a roulette spinner at the top. Buying barquillos typically involve a small game, where the buyer pays to spin the roulette. Depending on where the ticker lands, the buyer can either have one or two barquillos for the same price. The buyer can also pay a slightly larger amount to continue spinning the roulette and getting barquillos until it lands on one of the four golden markers.\n\nThe tradition of barquilleros almost became extinct during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Today, barquillos are most popular in Asia which has a larger population than Spain.\n\nBarquillos are traditionally eaten plain. Modern versions, however, can flavor it with ingredients including vanilla, cinnamon, grated coconut, and lemon juice. Barquillos are also commonly dipped or coated in milk chocolate or have a chocolate center. Due to their similarity to ice cream cones, they are also commonly sold as containers for frozen treats.\n\nSimilar recipes to barquillos also exist in other countries in Europe, like the \"parizske pecivo\" of Czechoslovakia, the \"pirouettes\" of France, and \"krumkake\" of Norway. Flat versions are known as \"wafle\" in Poland, \"goro\" in Norway, and \"pizzelle\" in Italy, among others.\n\nIn Argentina and Chile, cylindrical barquillos filled with dulce de leche, chocolate, or other sweet fillings are known as \"cuchuflís\" (Chile) or \"cubanitos\" (Argentina).\n\nBarquillos in the Philippines lack the grid-pattern of traditional Spanish barquillos. They are thinner and are usually rolled into elongated cylindrical shapes. Philippine barquillos are most strongly associated with the city of Iloilo, particularly to the Deocampo bakery, which has been commercially mass-producing barquillos since 1896.\n\nA notable variant of barquillo is the Filipino \"barquiron\" (also spelled \"barqueron\"), which are barquillos filled with polvorón and crushed peanuts, cashew nuts, or pili nuts. It originates from the city of Iloilo. Other variants of Philippine barquillos include those flavored with ube, pandan leaves, and carrots, which are bright purple, green, and orange in color, respectively.\n\nIn Hong Kong, biscuit rolls are made of wheat flour, butter, egg, sugar, and vanilla flavour.

They are particularly prized in Chinese culture due to their rarity, supposedly high nutritional value, and flavour. Edible bird's nests are among the most expensive animal products consumed by humans, with nests being sold at prices up to about , depending on grading. The type or grading of a bird's nest depends on the type of bird as well as the shape and color of the bird's nest. It is usually white in colour, but there also exists a red version, sometimes called \"blood\" nest. The Chinese believe that it promotes good health, especially for the skin. The nests have been used in Chinese cooking for over 400 years, most often as bird's nest soup.\n\nThe Chinese name for edible bird's nest, [\"\"], translates literally as \"swallow's (or swift's) nest\"; in Indonesia \"\"sarang burung walet\"\" often serves as a synonym for bird's nest soup.\n\nThe best-known use of edible birds nest is bird's nest soup, a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. When dissolved in water, the birds' nests have a gelatinous texture used for soup or sweet soup (tong sui). It is mostly referred to as 燕窝 (yànwō) unless references are made to the savoury or sweet soup in Chinese cuisine. According to the Qing Dynasty manual of gastronomy, the \"Suiyuan shidan\", bird's nest was regarded as a delicate ingredient not to be flavoured or cooked with anything overpowering or oily. And while it is precious, it must also be served in relatively large quantities otherwise its texture cannot be fully experienced and enjoyed.\n\nIn addition to their use in soup, edible bird's nests can be used as an ingredient in other dishes. They can be cooked with rice to produce bird's nest congee or bird's nest boiled rice, or they can be added to egg tarts and other desserts. A bird's nest jelly can be made by placing the bird's nest in a ceramic container with minimal water and sugar (or salt) and double steamed. Ready-to-eat bird's nest jelly is available in jars as a commercial product.\n\nThe most heavily harvested nests are from the edible-nest swiftlet or white-nest swiftlet (\"Aerodramus fuciphagus\") and the black-nest swiftlet (\"Aerodramus maximus\"). The nests are supposedly rich in nutrients, which are traditionally believed to provide health benefits. Most nests are built during the breeding season by the male swiftlet over a period of 35 days. They take the shape of a shallow cup stuck to the cave wall. The nests are composed of interwoven strands of salivary cement. Both nests have high levels of calcium, iron, potassium, and magnesium.\n\nThe nests were formerly harvested from caves, principally the enormous limestone caves at Gomantong and Niah in Borneo. With the escalation in demand these sources have been supplanted since the late-1990s by purpose-built nesting houses, usually reinforced concrete structures following the design of the Southeast Asian shop-house (\"rumah toko\"/\"ruko\"). These nesting houses are normally found in urban areas near the sea, since the birds have a propensity to flock in such places. It has become an expanding industry as is evident in such places as the province of North Sumatra or the Pak Phanang District in Thailand. From those places the nests are mostly exported to the markets in Hong Kong, which has become the centre of the world trade, valued at around HK$2 billion per year, although most of the final consumers are from mainland China. China is the world's largest consumer of birds' nests, accounting for more than 90 percent of consumption.\n\nIndonesia is the largest bird's nest producer in Southeast Asia, exporting around 2,000 tonnes per year, followed by Malaysia at 600 tonnes, and Thailand, 400 tonnes. The Philippines, around five tonnes per year, is the smallest producer.\n\nIt has been estimated that the bird's nest industry now accounts for 0.5 percent of the Indonesian GDP, equivalent to about a quarter of the country's fishing industry. In Thailand, the trade value of bird's nests, both wild and \"farmed\", is estimated at around 10 billion baht per year. The industry globally is an estimated .\n\nHong Kong and the United States are the largest importers of nests. In Hong Kong, a bowl of bird's nest soup would cost to .\n\nA kilogram of white bird's nest can fetch up to , and a kilogram of red nests up to . The white nests can be treated with red pigment to defraud buyers, but methods have been developed to determine an adulterated nest. Natural red cave nests are often found in limestone caves in Pak Phayun District, Thailand. The high returns and growing demand has attracted counterfeiters, leading to the halt of Malaysian nest exports to China. The Malaysian government has since employed RFID technology to thwart counterfeiting by micro-chipping nests with details about harvesting, packaging, and transport. Industrial quality-control techniques such as failure mode and effects analysis have been applied to bird's nest processing at nesting houses in Sarawak, Malaysia and reported by a research team at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.\n\nBecause a bird's nest is an animal product, it is subject to strict import restrictions in some countries, particularly with regard to H5N1 avian flu.\n\nImport of nests into Australia is strictly prohibited unless imported with an official Customs and Quarantine import permit from the Australian Department of Agriculture. \n\nIn Canada, commercially prepared, canned, and sterile bird's nest preparations are generally acceptable, but may be subject to restrictions.\n\n\n"}

Chow fun, or stir-fried hor fun (\"Shahe fen\") noodles, is any number of different individual preparations (and could be compared to the number of pizza varieties in United States cuisine).\n\nThe main ingredient of this dish is \"hor fun\" noodles, which is also known as \"Shahe fen\", originating in the town of Shahe in Guangzhou. Hor fun wide rice noodles, or Guangzhou Shahe fen, is a noodle that is said to have originated in the town of Shahe, now a subdistrict of the city of Guangzhou, China. (Hinsbergh) It is a wide, flat noodle that is cut into shape (\"qiefen\".) The most common methods of cooking \"hor fun\" are in soup or stir fried. \"Hor fun\" can be dry-fried (fried without sauce) or wet-fried (fried with a sauce).\n\nThe meat is marinated first. Then, the beef is seared in the wok. Other ingredients and the hor fun noodles are added, then combined with the beef and sauce. The bean sprouts are then stir fried with the rest of the chow fun until they are tender and the dish is ready to serve.\n\nAn important factor in the making of this dish is \"\"wok hei\"\" (鑊氣). The cooking must be done over a high flame and the stirring must be done quickly. Not only must the \"hor fun\" be stirred quickly, it must not be handled too strongly or it will break into pieces. The amount of oil also needs to be controlled very well, if not, the excess oil or dry texture will ruin the dish. Because of these factors, this dish is a major test for chefs in Cantonese cooking.\n\nThe origin of chow fun is unknown, but there is a legend concerning the origin of dry-fried chow fun:\nThe Singaporean government once had legislation that banned Beef chow fun, out of the belief that it was too oily, and thus detrimental to human health. The ban has since been reversed.\n\n"}

They are easily distinguishable from fish balls due to their darker color. Another characteristic is the tiny pieces of tendon in each ball will dissolve with prolonged cooking.\n\nNearly all meatballs (made from pork, beef, fish, etc.) made in Asia differ significantly in texture to their counterparts with European origins. Instead of mincing and forming meats, meat used for making meatballs is pounded until the meat is more or less pulverized. This is also often the case for fillings in steamed dishes. This process is what lends a smooth texture to the meatballs. Pounding, unlike mincing, uncoils and stretches previously wound and tangled protein strands in meat and allows them to cure to a gel with heat in a similar manner as surimi.\n\nBeef balls are commonly mixed in with wonton noodles and other fish ball noodles.

Adhesion may be improved by moistening the wrapper's inner edges, typically by dipping a fingertip into water and running it across the dry dough to dissolve the extra flour. As part of the sealing process, air is pressed out of the interior to avoid rupturing the wonton from internal pressure when cooked.\n\nThe most common filling is ground pork and shrimp with a small amount of flour added as a binder. The mixture is seasoned with salt, spices, and often garlic or finely chopped green onion. Factory-made, frozen varieties are sold in supermarkets. Commonly, they are handmade at the point of sale in markets or small restaurants by the proprietor while awaiting customers. In markets, they are sold by the unit, without being pre-cooked.\n\nWontons are commonly boiled and served in soup or sometimes deep-fried. There are several common regional variations of shape.\n\nThe most versatile shape is a simple right triangle, made by folding the square wrapper in half by pulling together two diagonally opposite corners. Its flat profile allows it to be pan-fried like a \"guotie\" (pot sticker) in addition to being boiled or deep-fried.\n\nA more globular wonton can be formed by folding all four corners together, resulting in a shape reminiscent of a stereotypical hobo's bindle made by tying all four corners of a cloth together.\n\nA related kind of wonton is made by using the same kind of wrapper, but applying only a minute amount of filling (frequently meat) and quickly closing the wrapper-holding hand, sealing the wonton into an unevenly squashed shape. These are called \"xiao huntun\" (literally \"little wonton\") and are invariably served in a soup, often with condiments such as pickles, ginger, sesame oil, and cilantro (coriander leaves).\n\nEach region of China has its own variations of wonton, examples include Beijing, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangnan, Jiangxi, Guangdong (Canton), Fujian, etc.\n\nDumplings and wontons from the 7th and 8th centuries CE were found in Turpan.\n\nIn Cantonese cuisine, shrimp filled wonton within minced pork is most commonly served with thin noodles to make wonton noodles. It may also be consumed with red vinegar. The soup is made from boiling shrimp shells, pork bones and dried flounder to give it a distinct taste. Hong Kong wontons were introduced to the area after World War II as street food and later indoor eateries. Wonton is served in variety of sizes with smallest being two wonton and noodles called \"Sai Yung\".\n\nIn Sichuan, semi-pentagonal wonton are known as \"folded arms\" () since after initially folding the wonton skin into a right triangle, each end of the hypotenuse are pressed against the middle of opposite sides, creating an impression of crossed arms/hands. These are often served in a sesame paste and chili oil sauce as a dish called \"red oil wonton\" ().\n\nIn Shanghai and its surrounding area (Jiangnan, nowadays Yangtze River Delta), Wonton filling is most often made with minced meat (usually pork) and shepherd's purse served in chicken soup; however, Shanghai cuisine makes a clear distinction between small wontons and large wontons. The former are casually wrapped by closing the palm on a wrapper with a dab of pork filling as if crumpling a sheet of paper. These are popular accompaniments to breakfast or brunch fare. The \"large\" wontons are carefully wrapped (often resembling large tortellini) and a single bowl can serve as lunch or a light dinner. They are available with a large variety of fillings; a popular Shanghai fast food chain offers more than 50 varieties. One popular variety in Shanghai which is said to have originated in Suzhou is \"three delicacies wonton\" (\"san xian hun tun\")which contains pork, shrimp and fish as primary ingredients.\n\nNingbo Wonton has two types, steamed Wonton and Wonton soup. Both are filled with pork and shrimp.\nAvailable at many Chinese-American restaurants, these wontons became popular due to their traditional preparation.\n\nJiangsu is often called \"wonton\". Wonton have two types, small wonton and big wonton. Big wonton is a large ingot shape. Generally boiled with boiled water, point lard with MSG, the soup will usually be matched with egg skin, seaweed, mustard and shrimp.\n\nIn American Chinese cuisine (and occasionally in Canada as well), wontons are served in two ways: in wonton soup (wontons in a clear broth), and as an appetizer called fried wontons. Fried wontons are served with a meat filling, (usually pork), and eaten with duck sauce, plum sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or hot mustard. A version of fried wontons are filled with a cream cheese and crab filling; these are called crab rangoon. Another version of fried wontons are filled with a mixture of cream cheese, green onions, soy sauce and garlic. These are best when eaten with sweet and sour sauce. Compared to the Far East versions, fried wontons are eaten dry.\n\nWonton strips, deep-fried strips made from wonton wrappers and served with hot mustard and/or dipping sauce, are a common complimentary appetizer in American-style Chinese restaurants.\n\nIn the Philippines, fried wontons are often called \"pinseques fritos\" (\"pinsec frito\" in the Castilian singular). \"Pritong pinsek\" is the Cebuan and Tagalog name. It also figures in the noodle soup Pancit Molo, named after the Molo district of Iloilo City. Wonton wrappers in the broth serve as the noodles in the dish.\n\nIn Indonesian Chinese cuisine, they are called \"Pangsit\". Served fried or in soup, usually with Chinese noodles.\n\nIn Peruvian-Chinese gastronomic fusion called Chifa, wonton, called Wantán in Peru, can be found fried with meat filling to eat with rice or \"Tallarín saltado\", and also in wonton soup or Sopa Wantán.\n\nIn Thailand, wonton is called \"kiao\" (, ), from Hokkien pronunciation of 饺 (Mandarin: \"jiǎo\"; \"dumpling\"). Wonton soup is called \"kiao nam\" (, ); the soup is made with chicken stock and the wontons made with a pork filling. The soup is very famous in Thailand.\n\nIn Northern Europe, mainly Russia (where they are called \"pelmenyi\") and Estonia (where they are called \"pelmeenid\"), wontons are usually filled with minced meat. They are eaten either boiled or fried, and many people eat them with vinegar and sour cream.\n\nIn Mandarin, they are called \"hundun\" ().\n\nIn Cantonese, they are called \"wantan\" (), which literally means \"cloud swallow\" because when they are cooked, the dumplings float in the broth like small clouds.\n\nHundun (混沌, close pronunciation to Hundun 馄饨) is also a legendary faceless being in Chinese mythology and the primordial and central chaos in Chinese cosmogony, comparable with the World egg.\n"}
{"id": "47839432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47839432", "title": "Hot pot", "text": "Hot pot\n\nHot pot, or \"hotpot\" () is a Chinese cooking method, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table, containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table, in a manner similar to fondue. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce.\n\nArcheological evidence shows that the earliest hot pots appeared around the Han dynasty. Diners among the nobility each had a personal pot. Later, during the Qing dynasty, hot pot became popular among the emperors. In particular, the Qianlong Emperor was very fond of hot pot, and would eat it for almost every meal. Later, the Jiaqing Emperor also had a banquet with 1550 hot pots at his coronation. Empress Dowager Cixi was also known to have enjoyed hot pot, especially in the winter months.\n\nThere are many reasons explaining why the hot pot became popular. The most convincing one is a folklore about emperors’ love. Qianlong, one of the emperors in Qing Dynasty ardently loved it, even eating hot pot every meal. When setting banquet, Qianlong always asked servants to prepare hot pots. His son, Emperor Jiaqing also liked the hot pot. The day he ascended the throne, he set more than 1500 tables of hot pots to celebrate. Following the two emperors, people desired to try hot pot. Thereafter, hot pot became popular. \n\nAnother widely accepted reason is that the hot pot has the power to enhance friendship and unite family members or colleagues. Several people sit around a hot pot, talking and eating. They pick up food in one pot, which creates a natural closeness atmosphere to them. The warm air is also considered to make people comfortable.\n\nDifferent kinds of hot pots can be found in Chongqing and Sichuan – typically, more modern eateries offer the sectioned bowl with differently flavored broths in each section. More traditional or older establishments serve a fragrant, mild broth in the hot pot, which is a large brass vessel heated by burning coals in a central chimney. The broth is boiled in a deep, donut-shaped bowl surrounding the chimney.\n\nOne of the most famous variations is the Chongqing hot pot ( \"numb and spicy\") , to which Sichuan pepper ( \"huā jiāo\" \"flower pepper\"; also known as \"prickly ash\") is added. It is usual to use a variety of different meats as well as sliced mutton fillet. A Chongqing hotpot is markedly different from the types eaten in other parts of China. Quite often the differences lie in the meats used, the type of soup base, and the sauces and condiments used to flavor the meat. The typical dipping sauce contains sesame oil and is mixed with crushed fresh garlic and chopped spring onions. \n\n\"Má là huǒ guō\" could be used to distinguish from simply \"huǒ guō\" in cases when people refer to the \"Northern Style Hot Pot\" in China. Instant-boiled mutton () could be viewed as representative of this kind of food, which does not focus on the soup base.\n\nSichuan also has a number of dry hot pots such as \"Malaxiangguo\" which are similar to those described above, but lack the soup base. Otherwise, similar ingredients are used and the dish served in a similar manner.\n\nIn neighbouring Yunnan, although spicy broths are equally popular, there is another predominant type of hot pot that is made with various wild or planted mushrooms. The big difference between the mushroom hot pot and the spicy hot pot is that the former rarely uses spice and chili in order to keep the original flavor of the mushrooms. The mushroom hot pot is also seasonal, depending on the availability of local mushrooms.\n\nThe Manchurian hot pot () uses plenty of \"suan cai\" (Chinese sauerkraut) (; pinyin: suān cài) to make the pot's stew sour.\n\nA Cantonese variation includes mixing a raw egg with the condiments to reduce the amount of \"heat\" absorbed by the food, thereby reducing the likelihood of a sore throat after the steamboat meal, according to Chinese herbalist theories.\n\nIn Hubei, hot pot is normally prepared with hot spice and Sichuan pepper. Items supplied to be cooked in this broth include mushrooms, thinly shaved beef or lamb, lettuce, and various other green vegetables.\n\nIn Hainan cuisine hot pot is generally served in small woks with a prepared broth containing pieces of meat. At the time of serving, the meat is not fully cooked. Approximately fifteen minutes is required before it is ready to eat. Items supplied to be cooked in this type of hot pot include mushrooms, thinly shaved beef or goat meat (referred to as mutton), lettuce, and other green vegetables. This dish varies somewhat in different parts of the province.\n\nIn Japan, hot pot dishes are called \"nabemono\". There are dozens of varieties of hot pots, and each hot pot has a distinguished flavor and style.\n\n\"Sukiyaki\" is one of the most popular hot pot dishes among the Japanese, and undoubtedly the most well-known Japanese hot pot overseas, particularly in English-speaking parts of the world. \"Sukiyaki\" hot pot is served with sliced beef, vegetables and tofu in a sweet sauce based on soy sauce, which is only used in small amounts, enough for the ingredients to merge in a shallow iron pot. Before being eaten, the ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs.\n\n\"Shabu-shabu\" is another popular hot pot in Japan. \"Shabu-shabu\" hot pot is prepared by submerging a very thin slice of meat or a piece of vegetable in a pot of broth made with kelp (\"kombu\") and swishing it back and forth several times. The familiar swishing sound is where the dish gets its name. \"Shabu-shabu\" directly translates to \"swish swish.\" Cooked meat and vegetables are usually dipped in \"ponzu\" or \"goma\" (sesame seed) sauce before eating. Once the meat and vegetables have been eaten, leftover broth from the pot is customarily combined with the remaining rice, and the resulting soup is usually eaten last.\n\nBecause the \"shabu-shabu\" hot pot cooks beef \"blue rare\" to rare, use of high-grade Japanese beef is preferred. Typically, \"shabu-shabu\" is considered a fine dining dish, due to the quality of the meat used, and the price charged for it at restaurants in Japan.\n\nBoth \"sukiyaki\" and \"shabu-shabu\", rice or noodle is cooked with remained broth along with additional ingredients at the very end of the meal. This menu is called \"shime\", ending the meal. Traditionally, hot pots are considered fall and winter dishes.\n\nIn Cambodia, hot pot is called Yao Hon (យ៉ាវហន) or other regions call it Chhnang Pleurng (ឆ្នាំងភ្លើង), which literally translates to Pot Fire. It is usually eaten during celebrations or family gatherings. Just like the Chinese Hot Pot, Cambodian hot pot consist of all the same ingredients although the dish differs in that coconut milk is used as the base of the soup. Another variation of the dish is called \"Buttered Yao Hon\" or \"Buttered Chhnang Pleurng\" where all the same ingredients are used but except cooking in coconut milk soup it is cooked on a flat grill pan where butter is used as the base. It is similar to the Korean Barbecue. An herb sauce usually assist with the \"Buttered Yao Hon\" since all the ingredients are not flavored. \n\nTaiwanese hot pot (usually called 火鍋 in Mandarin or Taiwanese) is also called \"shabu-shabu\" when the food is prepared in Japanese style. It is very common to eat the food with a dipping sauce consisting of shacha sauce and raw egg yolk.\n\nIn Thailand, hotpot is called Thai suki, although it is quite different from the Japanese shabu-shabu variation called sukiyaki. Originally a Chinese-style hot pot, the number of ingredients to choose from was greatly increased and a Thai-style dipping sauce with chili sauce, chilli, lime, and coriander leaves was added. Another variation is \"Mu kratha\", the Thai hot pot, which originated from Korean barbecue combined with Thai suki.\n\nIn Vietnam, a hot pot is called \"lẩu\" or \"cù lao\", and the sour soup called \"canh chua\" is often cooked in hot pot style (called \"lẩu canh chua\"). The generic term for a salted fish hot pot is \"lẩu mắm\".\n\nIn the Philippines, the term Hot Pot has a different meaning and context when it comes to Chinese-Influenced Filipino Cuisines. Usually served by Chinese Restaurants (particularly Harbour City Dimsum among others), the Hot Pot is literally a huge pot (with cover) filled with cooked rice, choices of beef, pork or chicken slices, special sauce and choice vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, shallots, gingers, pechay, kangkong leaves and spices and some slices of hard-boiled eggs on top and is usually served piping hot and is to be accompanied by other Filipino Dimsum Favorites and drinks.\n\n\n\n"}

It is darkly colored in appearance and sweet and salty in taste. Although regional variants exist, hoisin sauce usually includes soy beans, fennel seeds, red chillies, and garlic. Vinegar, Chinese five spice and sugar are also commonly added. \n\nThe word \"hoisin\" (, Cantonese: hoi2 sin1 Mandarin: hǎixiān) is Chinese for seafood, but the sauce does not contain any seafood ingredients.\nThe key ingredient of hoisin sauce is fermented soy bean paste.\n\nPeking-style hoisin sauce ingredients include starches such as sweet potato, wheat and rice, and water, sugar, soybeans, sesame seeds, white distilled vinegar, salt, garlic, red chili peppers, and sometimes preservatives or coloring agents. Traditionally, hoisin sauce is made using toasted mashed soybeans. Despite the literal meaning, \"hoisin\" sauce does not contain seafood, nor is it typically used with it.\n\nIn Chinese cuisine dishes, hoisin sauce is used in Cantonese cuisine as a marinade sauce for meat or as a dipping sauce. \n\nHoisin sauce can be used as a marinade sauce for meat such as barbecued pork.\n\nHoisin sauce can be used as a dipping sauce for Peking duck, lettuce wrap, and steamed or panfried rice noodle roll (aka cheungfan).\n\nHoisin sauce can be used as a dipping sauce in other non-Cantonese cuisine such as Moo shu pork. \n\nIn Vietnamese, hoisin sauce is called \"tương đen\".

The sauce can be directly added into a bowl of phở at the table, or it can be used as a dip for the meat of phở dishes. In phở, hoisin is typically accompanied by Sriracha sauce or \"tương đỏ\". The hoisin sauce is also used to make a dipping sauce for Vietnamese spring rolls and other dishes similar to spring and summer rolls. In cooking, it can be used for glazing broiled chicken.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47840375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47840375", "title": "Jiaozi", "text": "Jiaozi\n\nJiaozi (; ) are a kind of Chinese dumpling, commonly eaten in China and other parts of East Asia. They are one of the major foods eaten during the Chinese New Year and year-round in the northern provinces. Though considered part of Chinese cuisine, \"jiaozi\" are popular in other parts of Asia and in Western countries.\n\n\"Jiaozi\" typically consist of a ground meat and/or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges together. Finished \"jiaozi\" can be boiled (\"shuǐ jiǎo\"), steamed (\"zhēng jiǎo\") or pan-fried (\"jiān jiǎo\") and are traditionally served with a black vinegar and sesame oil dip.\n\nIn China, there are several different folk stories explaining the origin of \"jiaozi\" and its name.\n\nTraditionally, \"jiaozi\" were thought to be invented during the era of the Eastern Han (AD 25–220) by Zhang Zhongjing who was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. \"Jiaozi\" were originally referred to as \"tender ears\" () because they were used to treat frostbitten ears. Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home during wintertime, when he found many common people had frostbitten ears, because they did not have warm clothes and sufficient food. He treated these poor people by stewing lamb, black pepper, and some warming medicines in a pot, chopped them, and used them to fill small dough wrappers. He boiled these dumplings and gave them with the broth to his patients, until the coming of the Chinese New Year. In order to celebrate the New Year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's recipe to make \"Jiao'er\".\n\nOther theories suggest that \"jiaozi\" may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia. In the Western Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 9) \"jiaozi\" (餃子) were called \"jiaozi\" (角子). During the Three Kingdoms period (AD 220–280), the book \"Guangya\" by Zhang Yi mentions \"jiaozi\". Yan Zhitui during the Northern Qi dynasty (AD 550–577) wrote: \"Today the \"jiaozi\", shaped like a crescent moon, is a common food in the world.\" Six Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings. Later in the Tang dynasty (AD 618–907), \"jiaozi\" become more popular, called \"Bian Shi\" (扁食). Chinese archaeologists have found a bowl of \"jiaozi\" in the Tang dynasty tombs in Turpan. 7th or 8th century dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.\n\n\"Jiaozi\" may also be named because they are horn-shaped. The Chinese word for \"horn\" is \"jiao\" (), and \"jiaozi\" was originally written with the Chinese character for \"horn\", but later it was replaced by the specific character , which has the food radical on the left and the phonetic component \"\" () on the right.\n\nAt the same time, \"jiaozi\" look like \"yuan bao\" silver or gold ingots used as currency during the Ming dynasty, and as the name sounds like the word for the earliest paper money, serving them is believed to bring prosperity. Many families eat these at midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve. Some cooks will even hide a clean coin inside a \"jiaozi\" for the lucky to find.\n\nNowadays, \"jiaozi\" are eaten year-round, and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They can be served as an appetizer, a side dish, or as the main course. In China, sometimes \"jiaozi\" is served as a last course during restaurant meals. As a breakfast dish, \"jiaozi\" are prepared alongside \"xiaolongbao\" at inexpensive roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly serving \"jiaozi\" to breakfast customers, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers and ready to eat all day. \"Jiaozi\" are always served with a soy sauce-based dipping sauce that may include vinegar, garlic, ginger, rice wine, hot sauce, and sesame oil.\n\nChinese dumplings \"(jiaozi)\" may be divided into various types depending on how they are cooked:\n\nDumplings that use egg rather than dough to wrap the filling are called \"egg dumplings\" ().\n\nAs a dish prepared at home, each family has its own preferred method of making them, using favorite fillings, with types and methods of preparation varying widely from region to region. Common dumpling meat fillings include pork, mutton, beef, chicken, fish, and shrimp, which are usually mixed with chopped vegetables. Popular vegetable fillings include napa cabbage, scallion (spring onions), leek, celery, spinach, mushroom, edible black fungus, carrot, and garlic chives.\n\nThere are many ways to fold \"jiaozi\". Basically, steps for folding the skin includes putting a single pleat in the middle, putting multiple pleats along the edge, making a wavy edge like a pie crust, turning a pleated edge in toward the body resulting in a rounded edge, and putting both ends together resulting in a round shape. Different shapes of Jiaozi require different folding techniques, but the most famous and common technique is the pinched-edge fold. Take a wrapper and put one tablespoon of filling into the center of the wrapper. Fold a half of edge to the other half. Use left thumb and forefinger to pinch one side of the half-moon wrapper, and then use right thumb to push the inside skin outward, right forefinger to make outside skin into small pleats. Use right thumb to clench those pleats. Repeat these steps to the other side of the wrapper, and make sure to clench the seal of Jiaozi. This is crescent-shaped \"jiaozi\", the most popular shape in China.\n\nJiaozi is called gaau ji in Cantonese and are standard fare in Guangdong style dim sum. The immediate noted difference to Northern style is that they are smaller and wrapped in a thinner translucent skin, and usually steamed. The smaller size and the thinner wrapper make the dumplings easier to cook through with steaming. In contrast to \"jiaozi\", Guangdong \"gaau ji\" are rarely home-made because the wrapper, which needs to be thin but tough enough to not break, is more difficult to make. Many types of fillings exist, with the most common type being har gow (), but fillings can include scallop, chicken, tofu, and mixed vegetables; dim sum restaurants often feature their own house specials or innovations. Dim sum chefs and artists often use ingredients in new or creative ways, or draw inspiration from other Chinese culinary traditions, such as Chaozhou, Hakka, or Shanghai. More creative chefs may even create fusion \"gaau ji\" by using elements from other cultures, such as Japanese (teriyaki) or Southeast Asian (satay or curry), while upscale restaurants may use expensive or exotic ingredients such as lobster, shark fin and bird's nest.\n\nAnother Cantonese dumpling is yau gok (), which are made with glutinous rice dough and deep fried.\n\nGuotie () is pan-fried \"jiaozi\", also known as potstickers (a direct character translation) or 'panstickers' - in North America, or \"yaki-gyoza\" in Japan. They are a Northern Chinese style dumpling popular as a street food, appetizer, or side order in Chinese cuisine. This dish is sometimes served on a dim sum menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for this dish usually contains pork (sometimes chicken, or beef in Muslim areas), cabbage (or Chinese cabbage and sometimes spinach), scallions (spring or green onions), ginger, Chinese rice wine or cooking wine, and sesame seed oil.\n\nGuotie are shallow-fried in a wok (Mandarin \"\"guo\"\"). A small quantity of water is added and the wok is covered. While the base of the dumplings is fried, the upper part is steamed and this gives a texture contrast typical of Chinese cuisine.\n\nAn alternative method is to steam in a wok and then fry to crispness on one side in a shallow frying pan.\n\nExactly the same dumpling is boiled in plenty of water to make jiaozi and both are eaten with a dipping sauce or chilli paste.\nThree or five folds are made on one side of the round wrapper that is rolled so that the edges are thinner than the middle. This gives the base a large surface area that helps to give the dumpling stability to stand up in the pan.\n\nThe Chinese method of preparing the dough is to pour boiling water onto the flour and letting stand for five minutes and then adding a small quantity of cold water. This helps to activate the gluten in the dough.\n\nOther names for \"guotie\":\n\n\"Guōtiē\" is said to date back over four millennia. However, the first mention in literature dates back to the medieval Chinese Song Dynasty (AD 9601280) reporting \"guōtiē\" as being exceptionally good for the human soul. Legend has it that they were invented by an imperial Chinese court chef who panicked after realizing he'd accidentally burnt a batch of dumplings. With no time to make any more, he eventually served them to the Emperor. 7th or 8th century old dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.\n\nThe Japanese word \"gyōza\" (ギョーザ, ギョウザ) was derived from the reading of 餃子 in the Jilu Mandarin (\"giǎoze\") and is written using the same Chinese characters. The selection of characters indicates that the word is of non-Japanese origin. Following the Second World War, Japanese soldiers who returned from northeastern China brought home gyōza recipes.\n\nThe prevalent differences between Japanese-style gyōza and Chinese-style jiaozi are the rich garlic flavor, which is less noticeable in the Chinese version, and that gyōza wrappers appear to be consistently thinner, due to the fact that most Japanese restaurants use machine-made wrappers. In contrast, the rustic cuisine of poor Chinese immigrants shaped westerners' views that Chinese restaurant jiaozi use thicker handmade wrappers. As jiaozi vary greatly across regions within China, these differences are not clear. For example, visitors will easily find thin skinned ones at restaurants in Shanghai, and from street food vendors in the Hangzhou region. Gyōza are identical to jiaozi made in Chinese households using store bought machine made wrappers. Gyōza are usually served with soy-based tare sauce seasoned with rice vinegar and/or chili oil (\"rāyu\" in Japanese, \"làyóu\" (辣油) in Mandarin Chinese). The most common recipe is a mixture of minced pork, cabbage, Asian chives, and sesame oil, and/or garlic, and/or ginger, which is then wrapped into thinly rolled dough skins. Gyoza share similarities with both pierogi and spring rolls and are cooked in the same fashion as pierogi, either boiled or fried.\n\nGyōza can be found in supermarkets and restaurants throughout Japan (Gyōza-skins, Frozen food, Finished product). Pan-fried gyōza are sold as a side dish in many \"ramen\" and Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe most popular preparation method is the pan-fried style called \"yaki-gyōza\" (), in which the dumpling is first fried on one flat side, creating a crispy skin. Then, water is added and the pan sealed with a lid, until the upper part of the dumpling is steamed. Other popular methods include boiled \"sui-gyōza\" () and deep fried \"age-gyōza\" ().\n\nStore-bought frozen dumplings are often prepared at home by first placing them in a pot of water which is brought to a boil, and then transferring them to a pan with oil to fry the skin.\n\nThe Tibetan version is known as momo (Tibetan: མོག་མོག་) The word \"momo\" comes from a Chinese loanword, \"momo\" (饃饃), which translates to \"steamed bread\". When preparing momo, flour is filled, most commonly with ground water buffalo meat. Often, ground lamb or chicken meat is used as alternate to water buffalo meat. Finely chopped onion, minced garlic, fresh minced ginger, cumin powder, salt, coriander/cilantro, etc. are added to meat for flavoring. Sauce made from cooked tomatoes flavored with timur (Sichuan pepper), minced red chilies is often served along with momo.\n\nJiaozi should not be confused with wonton; jiaozi have a thicker skin and a relatively flatter, more oblate, double-saucer like shape, and are usually eaten with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce (and/or hot chili sauce), while wontons have thinner skin and are usually served in broth. The dough for the jiaozi and wonton wrappers also consist of different ingredients.\n"}

The dish is popular in Southern China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The dish is usually served in a hot broth, garnished with leafy vegetables, and \"wonton\" dumplings. The types of leafy vegetables used are usually \"kai-lan\" also known as Chinese kale. Another type of dumpling known as \"shui jiao\" is sometimes served in place of wonton. It contains prawns, chicken or pork, spring onions with some chefs adding mushroom and black fungus. In Indonesia wonton noodles are called as mie pangsit. \n\nIn Hong Kong and Guangzhou, wonton noodles are usually served in steaming hot soup with shrimp wontons and garnished with leafy vegetables. There are plenty of variations of this popular Cantonese dish, with different toppings and garnishes. For example, the soup and wontons in a separate bowl, the noodles being served relatively dry, with the toppings and garnishes, dressed with sauce, dipping the noodles in the soup to eat it.\n\nThere are four distinct features: First, the wontons are predominantly prawn, with small amounts of minced pork, or no pork at all. The traditional filling for wontons consists 70% of shrimps and 30% of pork. Second, aficionados will insist on fresh, smooth thin noodles which are \"al dente\", free from the taste and odor which is characteristic in many egg noodles when cooked. Third, the bouillon is light brown (prepared from dried flounder) and is usually steaming hot. Lastly, garlic chives are used as a garnish. The first two give the dish a wet but crunchy or crispy mouthfeel. The last two give the dish a unique bouquet.\n\nIn order to ensure that the noodles are perfectly al dente and free from \"noodley\" taste, the cooking process and sequence must be meticulously adhered to. The wonton is cooked first, and then placed in the bowl. The noodles are blanched for only 10 seconds, after which they are rinsed under cold water and placed in the serving bowl. Piping hot bouillon is then scooped into the bowl, on top of the wonton noodles. The bouillon must be tasty, yet not so strong as to overpower the delicate taste of the wonton and the noodles which it is meant to accompany.\n\nWhen served, the spoon must be placed at the bottom, with the wontons above the spoon and the noodles on top. Because if the noodles soak in the soup for too long then it will be over cooked, this is strictly adhered to by the best wonton noodle establishments.\n\nAlthough the \"wonton noodle\" is synonymous with wonton and noodles served in piping hot bouillon, the dish may also be served \"dry\", as in lo mein (撈麵), where the wonton are placed on a large bed of noodles.\n\nMalaysia offers different versions of the dish, with different states having different versions of the dish and there are versions from Johor, Pahang, Perak, Penang, Sarawak, and Selangor. The Malaysian version differs from the original in having slices of char siu added to the dish, as well as the possibility of the soup and wontons in a separate bowl, the noodles being served relatively dry, dressed with oyster sauce and garnished with chopped spring onions. Some stalls include deep-fried wontons in the dry versions as well.\n\nOften served dry, the Hong Kong version can be found at Cantonese noodle joints with it being dry or soup. In Malacca, \"wontons\" are placed together with the noodles and \"wonton\" soup can be ordered separately. The Malacca version is also usually spicier than the other Malaysian versions due to the use of a special unsweetened chili sauce.\n\nVegetarian Wanton Mee also served in Malaysia in vegetarian restaurant. Instead of using pork to make Char Siu, wheat gluten is used.\n\nThere are three distinct types of wonton noodle dishes found in the country. One would be \"mami\", which is a noodle soup that has egg noodles, wontons, and various vegetables in a hot broth. Another type would be \"pancit molo\", which is similar to \"mami\", but the noodles used are the wonton wrappers themselves. A third type of wonton noodles are stir-fry egg noodles sold by hawkers and in small \"stand-up\" type stalls. Here, the noodles are stir-fried with mung bean sprouts and vegetables, flavored with a range of sauces, and finally topped with wontons.\n\nSingapore wonton noodles includes noodles, leafy vegetables (preferably \"cai-xin\"), barbecued pork (\"char siu\") and bite-sized dumplings or \"wonton\". It is either served dry or in soup form with the former being more popular. If served dry, the wontons will be served in a separate bowl of soup. \"Shui jiao\" or prawn dumplings are served at some stalls and the original Hong Kong version is available at Cantonese restaurants and noodle joints. Fried wontons (wontons deep fried in oil) are sometimes served instead of those boiled in the soup. The Singaporean and Malaysian versions of the wonton noodle are similar to each other, though the Singapore version uses significantly less soya sauce and is often served with chili ketchup.\n\n\"Wonton noodles\" (; \"bami kiao\") are also very popular in Thailand, where, as in Malaysia and Singapore, the dish is often ordered together with barbecued pork which is then called \"bami mu daeng kiao\" (; \"mu daeng\" meaning \"red pork\"). As is customary with many noodle soups of Chinese origin in Thailand, chillies preserved in vinegar, dried chilli flakes, sugar, and fish sauce are added to taste. The dish is mostly eaten in soup form but it can also be served dry with the broth on the side.\n\n"}

Unlike artisan cheese, which may also include milk purchased and transported from off-farm sources, farmstead cheese makers only use milk from animals they raise. According to the American Cheese Society, \"milk used in the production of farmstead cheeses may not be obtained from any outside source\". As a result, the cheeses produced often have unique flavors owing to the farm's local terroir. Most farmstead cheese is produced from cow, goat or sheep milk, although some farmstead cheeses are produced from water buffalo milk (mainly Buffalo mozzarella).\n\nFarmstead cheeses are most often made on family farms in small batches and is often sold at local farmers' markets. While Europe has long had a very strong tradition of farmstead cheese-making, it is only in the last decades of the 20th century that farmstead cheese-making began to return to prominence in North America. In the United States, the top states for farmstead cheesmaking include Vermont, California, and Wisconsin, although farmstead cheese is growing rapidly in other states, like Georgia, as well.

It is a street food that may be prepared with many herbs and spices. Macun originated from spicy preparations of Mesir macunu, a traditional Turkish herbal paste from the classical antiquity period. During classical antiquity, macun was consumed as a pharmaceutical medicine. It was historically served in a round tray with separate compartments for the various flavors, a serving style that has continued into modern times. The consumption of macun is a part of some Turkish customs.\n\nMacun is a street food that is often sold outdoors, especially during street festivals (\"panayır\"). It is a popular sweet among children. The color of various macuns may be vivid or bright. Macun may be prepared with a great deal of herbs and spices. Ingredients to flavor macun have traditionally included bergamot, cinnamon, mastic, mint, rose, lemon and plum.\n\nMacun originated from spicy preparations of Mesir macunu, a traditional herbal paste from classical antiquity. During classical antiquity, macun was consumed as a pharmaceutical medicine.\n\nMacun was purported to have therapeutic effects to give the body strength and to calm one's spirit. Islamic physicians have prepared hundreds of different varieties of macun. The various herbs and spices used were mixed with honey in macun preparation, the latter of which also served to preserve the product. Various macuns have been served and consumed as both a medicine and as a confectionery (sweetmeats). During the Ottoman period, macun named \"Neruz macunu\", also referred to as \"nevruziyye\", was consumed as both a medicine and confectionery.\n\nDuring the 17th century in Turkey, the dervish Seyyid Hasan denoted the consumption of two flavors of macun, respectively flavored with mint and sweet flag. These macun varieties were served at meals he consumed with other dervishes and friends. Hasan was a part of the Sunbuliyye mystic order, as its sheikh.\n\nMacun is typically served in a round tin tray that has separate triangular-shaped compartments. It may be served by scooping using a \"macuncu mablaği\" or \"macunkeș\", which is shaped like a screwdriver. The macun is scooped and then wrapped around a small stick. This may be done with alternate flavors, which creates a striped sweet. In Turkey, people that serve macun may be referred to as \"macuncu\". \n\nIn the past in Turkey, the serving trays were constructed from copper or wood, and street vendors would stand the macun trays upon portable tripods. Others would carry macun in a container strapped to their waist with a belt, whereby the container had separate compartments for various flavors of the macun. Some macun vendors in Istanbul, Turkey, would try to attract customers and compete with other vendors by playing music. Street vendors would purvey macun to people at the Hıdırellez spring festival, on market days, holidays, at wedding processions, and at other times.\n\nIn the Anatolia region, it is a wedding custom for the groom to eat macun on the night of his wedding.

{"id": "47849325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47849325", "title": "Injera", "text": "Injera\n\nInjera, ; is a sourdough-risen flatbread with a slightly spongy texture, originating from the Horn of Africa. Traditionally made out of teff flour, it is the national dish of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is central to the dining process in those cultures as bread is the most fundamental component of any meal in Ethiopian, Eritrean and Somali cuisine.\n\nInjera is usually made from tiny, iron-rich teff seeds, which are ground into flour. Teff production is limited to certain middle elevations with adequate rainfall, and, as it is a low-yield crop, it is relatively expensive for the average household. As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, wheat, barley, corn, or rice flour are sometimes used to replace some or all of the teff content. Teff seeds are graded according to color, used to make different kinds of injera: \"nech\" (white), \"key\" or \"quey\" (red), and \"sergegna\" (mixed). Teff flour is gluten-free. \nTo make injera, teff flour is mixed with water. The fermentation process is triggered by adding ersho, obtained from previous fermentations. The mixture is then allowed to ferment for an average of two to three days, giving it a mildly sour taste. The injera is baked into large, flat pancakes. The dough's viscosity allows it to be poured onto the baking surface, rather than rolled out, which is unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread.\n\nIn terms of shape, injera compares to the French \"crêpe\" and the Indian \"dosa\" as a flatbread cooked in a circle and used as a base for other foods. In taste and texture, it is more similar to the South Indian \"appam\". The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, has a relatively smooth texture, while the top is porous. This porous texture makes injera good for scooping up sauces and dishes.\n\nTraditionally, injera is made with just two ingredients – \"Eragrostis tef\", also known as teff, an ancient grain from the highlands of Ethiopia, and water. There is little written or known about teff's origin and while there is no scholarly consensus, some believe that the production of teff dates back as far as 4000 BC. When teff is not available, usually because of location or financial limitations, injera is made by fermenting a variety of different grains, including barley, millet, and sorghum. Teff is, however, the preferred grain for making injera, primarily because of its sensory attributes (color, smell, taste).\n\nA variant of injera known as canjeelo is prepared from a dough of plain flour, self-raising flour, warm water, yeast, and a pinch of salt. The mixture is beaten by hand until soft and creamy. Sorghum is the preferred flour for making Canjeelo. There is a sweet-tasting variety of the dish, as well as another variety that is made with eggs Malawah.\n\nThe cooking method for injera has changed little since its origin. Traditionally, the flour is mixed with water and fermented for a short period of time. It is baked by pouring the mixture onto a giant circular griddle, known as a \"mitad.\" \n\nBaking is done on a circular griddle - either a large black clay plate over a fire or a specialized electric stove. The griddle is known as a () (in Amharic) or () (in Tigrinya). \"Mitads\" have been found at archaeological sites dating back as far as 600 AD. Nowadays, \"mitads\" are no longer always made out of clay, but can also be electric.\n\nTraditional clay stoves can be inefficient in that they consume large amounts of firewood and produce a lot of smoke, creating household pollution and making them dangerous to use around children. In 2003, an Eritrean research group designed a stove for cooking injera and other foods that uses more easily available fuel, such as twigs instead of large branches, crop residues and dung, locally called \"kubet\". Several parts of this new stove are made in the central cities of Ethiopia and Eritrea, while other parts are moulded from clay by women in local areas.\nMany women in urban areas—especially those living outside Ethiopia and Eritrea—now use electric injera stoves, which are topped with a large metal plate, or simply non-stick frying pans.\n\nIn Ethiopia and Eritrea, a variety of stews, salads (during Ethiopian Orthodox fasting, for which believers abstain from most animal products), and more injera (called \"injera firfir\") are placed on the injera for serving. Using one's hand (traditionally only the right one), small pieces of injera are torn and used to grasp the stews and salads for eating. The injera under these stews soaks up the juices and flavors of the foods, and after the stews and salads are gone, this bread is also consumed. Injera is thus simultaneously a food, eating utensil, and plate. When the entire \"tablecloth\" of injera is gone, the meal is over.\n\nIn Ethiopia and Eritrea, injera is eaten daily in virtually every household. Outside the Horn of Africa and Israel, injera may be found in grocery stores and restaurants specializing in Ethiopian, Somali, and Eritrean cooking. While originally specific to Ethiopia and other parts of the Horn of Africa, the Beta Israel, Jews originating in Ethiopia and Eritrea who now mainly live in Israel, have spread injera to that country.\n\nInjera is the most important component of any Ethiopian meal. It is often both the serving platter and utensil for a meal. Hearty stews such as \"wat\" are placed on top of the bread and then the meal is eaten by tearing pieces of injera off and scooping up the stews. While injera's literal use as the base and staple of any Ethiopian meal has not changed since its creation, its symbolic value has changed. Different varieties of injera can be found in the highlands versus the lowlands of Ethiopia. In the lowlands, injera is often made with sorghum and in the highlands it is more commonly made with barley. Either way, because it is made with something other than teff, its symbolic value has already decreased compared to the symbolic value of injera made with teff. There are symbolic value differences with types of teff as well. White-grained teff is more expensive to buy and thus symbolizes a higher status than its cheaper counterpart, red-grained teff.\n\nThere are similar variants to injera in other East African countries like Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan. The variant eaten in Somalia and Djibouti is called \"canjeero\", \"canjeelo\" or \"laxox\"; the variant eaten in South Sudan and Sudan is known as \"kisra\". In Somalia, at breakfast (referred to as \"qurac\"), the main meal of the day, injera (known as \"canjeero\") might also be eaten with a stew (\"maraq\") or soup. Canjeero, the Somali and the Djiboutian version of injera, is a staple of Somali and Djiboutian cuisine.\n\nInjera became more common in the United States during a big spike in Ethiopian immigration in the 1980s and 1990s, largely because of the Refugee Act passed in 1980. Teff is now being produced in the United States by the Teff Company in Idaho, making teff more accessible to expatriate Ethiopians.\n\n\n"}

It was created by immigrants from Hainan province in southern China and adapted from the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken. It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore and is most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine but is also seen throughout Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia where it is a culinary staple.\n\nHainanese chicken rice is a dish adapted from early Chinese immigrants originally from Hainan province in southern China. It is based on a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (文昌雞), which is one of four important Hainan dishes dating to the Chin dynasty. The Hainanese in China traditionally used a specific breed, the Wenchang chicken, to make the dish. The original dish was adapted by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia). \n\nAlmost every country in Asia with a history of immigration from China has a version. The San Francisco Chronicle says, \"the dish maps 150 years’ immigration from China’s Hainan Island...to Singapore and Malaysia, where the dish is often known as Hainan chicken rice; to Vietnam, where it is called “Hai Nam chicken”; and to Thailand, where it has been renamed “khao man gai” (“fatty rice chicken”).\" \n\nIn Singapore the dish was born out of frugality, created by servant-class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken.\n\nThe first chicken rice restaurants opened in Singapore during Japanese occupation in World War II, when the British were forced out and their Hainanese servants lost their source of income. One of the first was Yet Con, which opened in the early 1940s. The dish was popularised in Singapore in the 1950s by Moh Lee Twee, whose Swee Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant operated from 1947 to 1997. Hong Kong food critic Chua Lam credits Moh with the creation of the dish. Channel News Asia's Annette Tan credits Wang Yiyuan for \"bringing the dish\" to Singapore in the 1920s.\n\nHainanese chicken rice is considered one of Singapore's national dishes. It is eaten \"everywhere, every day\" in Singapore and is a \"ubiquitous sight in hawker centres across the country\".\n\nWhile most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine, the dish is also seen throughout Southeast Asia and in parts of the United States.\n\nIn a debate that stretches back decades to 1965, when the two countries split, both Malaysia and Singapore have laid claim to inventing the dish.\n\nIn 2009 Malaysia’s Tourism Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ng Yen Yen said that Hainanese chicken rice was \"uniquely Malaysian\" and had been \"hijacked\" by other countries.\n\nIn 2018 Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng joked that Singapore claimed \"chicken rice is theirs (and) if we’re not careful, ‘char koay teow‘ will become theirs\" one day.\n\nCatherine Ling of \"CNN\" called Hainanese chicken rice one of the \"40 Singapore foods we can't live without\". It was listed as one of the \"World's 50 best foods\" by CNN in 2018. David Farley of the BBC called it \"the dish worth the 15-hour flight\" and said it was \"deceptively simple – which is good, because on paper it sounds awfully boring.\" \"Saveur\" called it \"one of the most beloved culinary exports of Southeast Asia.\"\n\nThe chicken is prepared in accordance with traditional Hainanese methods, which involve poaching the entire chicken at sub-boiling temperatures to both cook the bird and produce stock. The bird is dipped in ice after cooking to produce a jelly-like skin finishing and hung to dry.\n\nThe stock is skimmed of fat and some of the fat and liquid, along with ginger, garlic, and pandan leaves, are used in the cooking of the rice, producing an oily, flavourful rice sometimes known as \"oily rice\". In Singapore \"the most important part of chicken rice is not the chicken, but the rice.\"\n\nThe dish is served with a dipping sauce of freshly minced red chilli and garlic, usually accompanied with dark soy sauce and freshly ground ginger. Fresh cucumber boiled in the chicken broth and light soy sauce with a dash of sesame oil are served with the chicken, which is usually served at room temperature. Some stalls may also serve nonya achar as an additional side.\n\nIn Malaysia, \"nasi ayam\" (literally \"rice chicken\" in Bahasa Melayu) is \"a culinary staple\" and a popular street food, particularly in Ipoh, a center of Hainanese immigration. \n\nThe general term \"nasi ayam\" can refer to multiple variations including roasted and fried chicken, can be served with a variety of sauces including barbecue, and can be accompanied by a variety of side dishes including steamed rice rather than seasoned 'oily' rice, soup, or chicken offal. \n\nIn Malacca, the rice is served in balls rather than in bowls; this dish is commonly known as \"Chicken rice balls\". Steamed rice is shaped into golf ball-sized orbs and served alongside the chopped chicken.\n\nHainanese chicken rice is a common dish in Thailand where it is called \"khao man kai\" (), literally meaning \"chicken-fat rice\". The chickens used in Thailand for this dish can be free range chickens of local breeds, resulting in a leaner and tastier dish, but increasingly meat chickens from large scale poultry farms are being used. \"Khao man kai\" is served with a garnish of cucumbers and occasionally chicken blood tofu and fresh coriander, along with a bowl of \"nam sup\", a clear chicken broth which often contains sliced daikon. The accompanying sauce is most often made with tauchu (also known as yellow soybean paste), thick soy sauce, chilli, ginger, garlic and vinegar.\n\nOne famous Bangkok neighborhood for \"Khao man kai\" is Pratunam in Ratchathewi district, located near to Platinum Fashion Mall, CentralWorld and Ratchaprasong Intersection. Some restaurant in Pratunam received Bib Gourmand awards from the 2018 Michelin Guide. It has been reported that these restaurants are especially popular amongst Hong Kong, Japanese and Taiwanese tourists. \"Khao man kai\" is also well known in other areas, including Bang Sue, Yaowarat and Phasi Charoen near Bang Wa BTS station and Phyathai 3 Hospital including various places viz Thanon Tok near Rama III Bridge, Thong Lor on Sukhumvit Road, Wat Suthiwararam School, Yan Nawa, Bang Kapi, Wat Saket and Saphan Kwai neighborhoods.\n\nThe dish is known as \"Cơm Gà Hải Nam\" in Vietnamese.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47850038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47850038", "title": "Staple food", "text": "Staple food\n\nA staple food, food staple, or simply a staple, is a food that is eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion of a standard diet for a given people, supplying a large fraction of energy needs and generally forming a significant proportion of the intake of other nutrients as well. A staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal, and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of food staples. Specific staples vary from place to place, but typically are inexpensive or readily available foods that supply one or more of the macronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Typical examples include tubers and roots, grains, legumes, and seeds.\n\nEarly agricultural civilizations valued the foods that they established as staples because, in addition to providing necessary nutrition, they generally are suitable for storage over long periods of time without decay. Such nonperishable foods are the only possible staples during seasons of shortage, such as dry seasons or cold temperate winters, against which times harvests have been stored. During seasons of plenty, wider choices of foods may be available.\n\nStaple foods are derived either from vegetables or animal products, and common staples include cereals (such as rice, wheat, maize, millet, or sorghum), starchy tubers or root vegetables (such as potatoes, cassava, sweet potatoes, yams, or taro), meat, fish, eggs, milk, and cheese. Other staple foods include pulses (dried legumes), sago (derived from the pith of the sago palm tree), and fruits (such as breadfruit and plantains). Staple foods may also include (depending on the region): olive oil, coconut oil and sugar (e.g. from plantains).\n\nOf the more than 50,000 edible plant species in the world, only a few hundred contribute significantly to human food supplies. Although there are over 10,000 species in the cereal family, just a few have been widely cultivated over the past 2,000 years.\n\nThe dominant staple foods in different parts of the world are a function of weather patterns, local terrain, farming constraints, acquired tastes and ecosystems. For example, the main energy source staples in the average African diet are cereals (46 percent), roots and tubers (20 percent) and animal products (7 percent). In Western Europe the main staples in the average diet are animal products (33 percent), cereals (26 percent), and roots and tubers (4 percent).\n\nMost of the human population lives on a diet based on one or more of the following staples: cereals (rice, wheat, maize (corn), millet, and sorghum), roots and tubers (potatoes, cassava, yams and taro), and animal products such as meat, milk, eggs, cheese and fish. Regional staples include the plants rye, soybeans, barley, oats, and teff.\n\nJust 15 plant crops provide 90 percent of the world's food energy intake (exclusive of meat), with rice, maize, and wheat comprising 2/3 of human food consumption. These three are the staples of about 80 percent of the world population, and rice feeds almost half of humanity.\n\nRoots and tubers, meanwhile, are important staples for over one billion people in the developing world, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the food eaten by half the population of sub-Saharan Africa. Roots and tubers are high in carbohydrates, calcium, and vitamin C, but low in protein. Cassava root, for example, is a major food staple in the developing world, a basic food source for around 500 million people.\n\nWith economic development and free trade, many countries have shifted away from low-nutrient-density staple foods to higher-nutrient-density staples, as well as towards greater meat consumption. Despite this trend, there is growing recognition of the importance of traditional staple crops in nutrition. Agriculture constantly seeks to identify better plant strains with superior nutrition, disease resistance, and higher yields.\n\nSome foods like quinoa—a pseudocereal grain that originally came from the Andes—were also staples centuries ago. Oca tubers, ulluku tubers and grain amaranth are other foods claimed to be historical Andean staples. Pemmican made from dried meat and fat was a staple of the Plains Indians of North America. In 2010, the global consumption of \"speciality grains\", such as quinoa, was very small compared to other staples, such as rice, wheat, and maize. These grains, once popular, are being reevaluated and reintroduced to certain markets.\n\nMost staple food is currently produced using modern, conventional farming practices. However, the production of staple food using organic farming methods is growing.\n\nRice is most commonly cooked and eaten as separate entire grains, but most other staple cereals are milled into a flour or meal that can be used to make bread, noodles, pasta, porridge and \"mushes\" like mealie pap. Root vegetables can be mashed and used to make porridge-like dishes such as poi and fufu. Pulses (such as chickpeas, from which gram flour is made) and starchy root vegetables (such as canna rhizomes) can also be made into flour.\n\nPlant-based food staples may not provide a full range of nutrients. The nutrient-deficiency disease pellagra is associated with a diet consisting primarily of maize, while the disease beriberi is associated with a diet of refined white rice. Scurvy can result from a lack of vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid. One author indicated that the nutritional value of some staple foods are negatively impacted by higher levels of carbon dioxide, as occurs in climate change.\n\nThe following table shows the nutrient content of 10 major staple vegetable foods in raw form, with the caveat that raw grains are not edible and cannot be digested. Raw grains must be cooked, sprouted, or otherwise prepared for human consumption. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is different from that of the raw form of these grains, as shown. Potatoes also must be cooked, but should not be sprouted. Note that the highlighted values show the highest nutrient density among these 10 staples. Other foods, consumed in smaller quantities, may have nutrient densities different from these values.\n"}

Many traditional soups are called \"soto\", whereas foreign and Western influenced soups are called \"sop\".\n\nSoto is sometimes considered Indonesia's national dish, as it is served from Sumatra to Papua, in a wide range of variations. Soto is omnipresent in Indonesia, available in many \"warungs\" and open-air eateries on many street corners, to fine dining restaurants and luxurious hotels. Soto, especially \"soto ayam\" (chicken soto), is an Indonesian equivalent of chicken soup. Because it is always served warm with a tender texture, it is considered an Indonesian comfort food.\n\nBecause of the proximity and significant numbers of Indonesian migrants working and settling in neighbouring countries, soto can also be found in Singapore and Malaysia, and has become a part of their cuisine.\n\nIntroduced to Suriname by Javanese migrants, it is part of the national cuisine of that country as well, where it is spelled saoto.\n\nIn the Indonesian archipelago, soto is known by different names. In the local Javanese dialect, it is called \"soto\", and the dish also reached Makassar where it is called \"coto\". Soto is found to be most prevalent in Java, and suggested that the hearty soup was originated from that island, and over the years this dish branched off in an assorted array of soto varieties.\n\nAlthough soto was undoubtedly developed in the Indonesian archipelago and each region has developed its own distinctive soto recipes, some historians suggest that it was probably influenced by foreign culinary tradition, especially Chinese. Denys Lombard in his book \"Le Carrefour Javanais\" suggested that the origin of soto was a Chinese soup, \"caudo\" (; literally \"Tripe\"), popular in Semarang among Chinese immigrants during colonial VOC era, circa 17th century.\n\nAnother scholar suggests that it was more likely a mixture of cooking traditions in the region, namely Chinese, Indian, and native Indonesian cuisine. There are traces of Chinese influence such as the use of \"bihun\" (rice vermicelli) and the preference for fried garlic as a condiment, while the use of turmeric suggests Indian influence. Another example is \"soto betawi\" from Jakarta uses \"minyak samin\" (ghee), which indicates Arab or Muslim Indian influences. Another historian suggest that some soto recipe reflects the past condition of its people. \"Soto tangkar\", which today is a meat soup, was mostly made from the broth of goat rib-cage bones (Betawi:\"tangkar\") in the past because meat was expensive, or the common population of Batavia were too poor to afford some meat back then. Soto recipes has been highly localized according to local tradition and available ingredients, for example in Hindu-majority island of Bali, \"soto babi\" (pork soto) can be found, since Hindu Balinese prefer pork while beef is seldom consumed, they also do not shared Indonesian Muslim halal dietary law that forbid the consumption of pork.\n\nThe meat soup dish influenced various regions and each developed its own recipes, with the ingredients being highly localized according to available ingredients and local cooking traditions. As a result, rich variants of soto were developed across Indonesia.\n\nThe spread of soto in Indonesian archipelago was followed by the localization of Soto's recipe, according to available ingredients and distinctive local taste. As the result, myriad soto recipes and variations can be found in Indonesia.\n\nSome sotos are named based on the town or region where they are created:\n\nOther sotos are named based upon their chief ingredient:\n\nThe following accompaniments are often eaten alongside soto:\n\nThe meats that are most commonly used are chicken and beef, but there are also variations with offal, mutton, and water buffalo meat. Pork is seldom used in traditional Indonesian \"soto\", however in Hindu majority Bali, \"soto babi\" (pork soto) can be found. The soup is usually accompanied by rice or compressed rice cakes (\"lontong\", \"ketupat\" or \"burasa\"). Offal is considered as a delicacy: the rumen (blanket/flat/smooth tripe), reticulum (honeycomb and pocket tripe), omasum (book/bible/leaf tripe), and the intestines are all eaten.\n\nOther ingredients of \"soto\" include \"soun\" alternatively spelled as \"sohun\" or \"bihun\" (rice vermicelli), mung bean sprouts and scallion. Common \"soto\" spices include shallots, garlic, turmeric, galangal, ginger, coriander, salt, candlenut, and pepper.\n\nThe color, thickness and consistency of \"soto\" soup could vary according to each recipes. \"Soto\" can have a light and clear broth just like \"soto bandung\", a yellow transparent broth (coloured with turmeric) like the one that can be found in \"soto ayam\", or a rich and thick coconut milk or milk broth just like those in \"soto kaki\" or \"soto betawi\".\n\n\"Soto\" in Malaysia and Singapore has a certain expected clear-soup look made of chicken broth, with spicy taste mixed with rice cubes. It seems that soto served there derived from common \"soto ayam\" type with a clear and slightly yellow-colored broth, pretty much similar to East Javanese \"soto lamongan\" or \"soto madura\". Like many dishes, it may have been brought into the country by the many Javanese migrants in the early 20th century.\n\n"}

It is native to the cuisines of Indonesia, and popular in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Brunei and Singapore. It has also spread through overseas Indonesian populations to the Netherlands and Suriname.\n\nVarious recipes of \"sambals\" usually are served as hot and spicy condiments for dishes, such as \"lalab\" (raw vegetables), \"ikan bakar\" (grilled fish), \"ikan goreng\" (fried fish), \"ayam goreng\" (fried chicken), \"ayam penyet\" (smashed chicken), \"iga penyet\" (ribs) and various \"soto\" soup.\n\nTraditional sambals are freshly made using traditional tools, such as a stone pestle and mortar. Sambal can be served raw or cooked. The chili pepper, garlic, shallot and tomato are often freshly ground using a mortar, while the \"terasi\" or \"belacan\" (shrimp paste) is fried or burned first to kill its pungent smell as well as to release its aroma. \"Sambal\" might be prepared in bulk, as it can be easily stored in a well-sealed glass jar in the refrigerator for a week to be served with meals as a condiment. However, some households and restaurants insist on making freshly prepared sambal just a few moments prior to consuming in order to ensure its freshness and flavor; this is known as \"sambal dadak\" (lit. \"impromptu sambal\" or \"freshly made sambal\"). Nevertheless, in most \"warung\" and restaurants, most sambal is prepared daily in bulk and offered as a hot and spicy condiment.\n\nToday some brands of prepared, prepacked, instant, or ready-to-use sambal are available in warung, traditional markets, supermarkets and convenience stores. Most are bottled sambal, with a few brands available in plastic or aluminum sachet packaging. Compared to traditional sambals, bottled instant sambals often have a finer texture, more homogenous content, and thicker consistency, like tomato ketchup, due to the machine-driven manufacturing process. Traditionally made sambals ground in a pestle and mortar usually have a coarse texture and consistency.\n\nSeveral brands produce bottled sambals, among others are Huy Fong Foods' \"sambal oelek\", Heinz ABC \"sambal terasi\" and several variants of sambal Indofood.\n\nThe most common kinds of peppers used in sambal are:\n\nIn the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 300 varieties of \"sambal\".

Various specific version exist, including as Sundanese \"ikan bakar Cianjur\", which mainly grilled freshwater fish, such as carp and gourami, and Balinese \"ikan bakar Jimbaran\", freshly grilled seafood fish in \"warungs\" clustered near Jimbaran beach and fishmarket in Bali.

The spice mixture may vary among regions and places, but usually it consists of a combination of ground shallot, garlic, chili pepper, coriander, tamarind juice, candlenut, turmeric, galangal and salt. In Java and most of Indonesia, ikan bakar usually tastes rather sweet because the generous amount of sweet soy sauce either as marination or dipping sauce.

They are made from various dried fruits, tubers, vegetables, and fish that have undergone a deep frying process in hot vegetable oil. They can be lightly seasoned with salt, or spiced with chili powder and sugar.\n\nTogether with \"krupuk\", the etymology of the term \"kripik\" is believed as an onomatopoeia in Indonesian to describe the crunch sound of this crispy snack.\n\n\"Kripik\" (chips) and \"krupuk\" (crackers) are an integral part of Indonesian cuisine. \"Kripik\" commonly are made from dried slices of roots and tubers. The most popular are \"kripik singkong\" (cassava crackers) and \"kripik pisang\" (Banana chips); other types of fruit, yam or tuber crackers are also available.\n\n\"Kripik\" is closely related to \"krupuk\" since it is popularly considered as a smaller sized \"krupuk\". In Indonesia, the term \"krupuk\" refers to a type of relatively large crackers, while \"kripik\" or \"keripik\" refers to smaller bite-size crackers; the counterpart of chips (or crisps) in western cuisine. For example, potato chips are called \"kripik kentang\" in Indonesia. Usually \"krupuk\" are made from a dried paste consisting of a mixture of starch and other ingredients, while \"kripik\" are usually made entirely from a thinly sliced, sun-dried, and then deep-fried product without any mixture of starch.\n\nAlmost all type of fruits, nuts, tubers and plant products can be made into \"kripik\".

However, just like the potato chip industry in the western counterpart, in Indonesia today it is common to encounter mass-produced packed \"kripik\" snacks in \"warung\" shops, minimarkets and supermarkets. Some brands have mass-produced certain variants of \"kripik\" chips.\n\nIn Indonesia, \"kripiks\" are often sold as \"oleh-oleh\" or food gift to be brought home after travel. Certain areas has developed their specialty \"kripiks\" which depend on locally available ingredients and recipes. For example, Lampung is well known for its banana \"kripiks\", Malang in East Java for its fruit-based \"kripiks\", including apple and jackfruit \"kripiks\", while Bandung is well known for its tempeh, oncom, tubers and sweet potato-based \"kripiks\". Bukittinggi city in West Sumatra on the other hand, is famous for its \"Keripik sanjay\", a hot and spicy cassava chips coated with \"balado\" chili sauce.\n\nThe latest trend in Indonesia's \"kripik\" industry is extra hot \"kripiks\" with ample chili powder, which started with \"Keripik Pedas Maicih\" (Maicih spicy crackers) in Bandung in 2010. It is a bag of fiery hot cassava chips offered in different levels of spiciness. Subsequently, the popularity of extra hot \"kripik\" ' swept across nation.\n\n"}

It is made from tomatoes, cucumbers, onion/scallions, raw or roasted peppers, sirene (white brine cheese), and parsley.\n\nThe vegetables are usually diced and salted, followed by a light dressing of sunflower oil (or olive oil, which is less authentic), which are occasionally complemented by vinegar. The addition of vinegar contributes, however, to the sour flavour that the tomatoes impart. In restaurants, the dressings are provided separately. Lastly, the vegetables are covered in a thick layer of grated or diced sirene cheese. This salad is often consumed as an appetiser with rakia.\n\nThough the salad's name comes from the region called Shopluk, in fact, it was invented ca. 1955 in a Black Sea resort near Varna, called Druzhba. It is a product of early socialism in Bulgaria, and part of tourist promotion, the only survivor of five or six similar recipes. At the time, leading chefs from Balkantourist invented Dobrujan, Macedonian, Thracian and several other salads with similar names, which were associated with different ethnographical regions.

It is usually served with \"dal\" or other types of curry, but can also be cooked in a range of sweet or savoury variations made with a variety of ingredients such as sardines, meat, egg, or cheese. \n\nRoti canai is a popular breakfast and snack dish in Malaysia, and one of the most famous examples of Malaysian Indian cuisine. It is said that the dish was brought over from India by Indian Muslims, also known as \"Mamaks\" in Malaysia, and is served in mamak stalls located in both rural and urban Malaysia.\n\nIt is considered as a variation of parotta but it does not exist in India. The closest kin to roti canai is believed to be Malabar parotta.\n\n\"Roti\" means bread in Sanskrit, and most other Indian languages. \"Canai\" has a disputed origin: it may be derived from Chennai, the Indian city formerly known as Madras; from the same Malay word \"canai\", meaning \"to roll out dough\"; or from c\"hanna\", a Northern Indian dish made with boiled chickpeas in a spicy gravy, with which this type of bread was traditionally served.\n\nIn Southern Malaysia and in Singapore the dish is known as \"roti prata\", similarly to the Indian \"paratha\" or \"parotta\". The Hindi word \"paratha\" means \"flat\".\n\nRoti canai is made from dough which is usually composed of fat (usually ghee), flour and water; some recipes also include sweetened condensed milk. The dough is repeatedly kneaded, flattened, oiled, and folded before proofing, creating layers. The dough ball is then flattened, spread out until paper thin (usually by \"tossing\" it on a flat surface), and gathered into a long rope-like mass. This \"rope\" is then wound into a knot or spiral and flattened, so that it consists of thin flakes of dough when cooked.\nUp until the 1970s, it was common for cooks to form a spiral with the \"rope\" (much like the modern \"roti bom\"), but this is no longer the case, probably because the amount of dough used per roti is about half of what it used to be. When making varieties with fillings, however, the fillings (eggs, chopped onions, etc.) are spread or sprinkled on the thin sheet of dough, which is then folded with the fillings inside.\n\nPlain roti is often referred to as \"roti kosong\" (\"empty bread\" in Malay). Roti canai is inexpensive in Malaysia (a standard price is RM1.20 per piece). \n\nTraditionally, roti canai is served with \"dal\" (lentil) curry. It may also be served with the following curries:\n\n\nDifferent varieties of roti canai served in Malaysia are listed below: \n\n\nIn Indonesia, roti canai is also called \"roti cane, roti konde\" or \"roti maryam,\" and is usually served with \"kari kambing\" (mutton curry). Roti cane came into Indonesia via the influx of Muslim Indian migration to Aceh Sultanate in Northern parts of Sumatra circa 17th century, and later to the rest of Dutch East Indies in early 19th century. Roti canai is more prevalent in Sumatra, especially in Aceh, North and West Sumatra. Roti cane has been adopted by the Malay cuisine of Sumatra, Aceh cuisine, and Minangkabau cuisine. Consequently, there are Malay, Aceh, and Minangkabau restaurants that serve roti canai with mutton curry in Indonesia that are operated by ethnic groups other than Indians. This Indian-origin dish has been so well-integrated into Aceh cuisine that it is considered their own.\n\nIn Ampel, an Arab quarter in Surabaya, it is known as \"roti maryam\", while common Javanese called it \"roti konde\" after its similar shape to a hairbun (Javanese: \"konde\"). Despite having different names, their recipes are quite similar, and they are influenced by Indian \"paratha\".\n\nRoti prata is a fried flatbread that is cooked over a flat grill. It is usually served with a vegetable- or meat-based curry and is also commonly cooked with cheese, onions, bananas, red beans, chocolate, mushrooms or eggs. Roti prata is prepared by flipping the dough into a large thin layer before folding the outside edges inwards. The dough is cooked on a flat round iron pan measuring about three feet in diameter. The cooking process lasts two to three minutes. Many of the roti canai variations found in Malaysia are also popular in Singapore.\n\nIn Thailand, \"roti\" (with variations on spelling such as \"ro tee\") is commonly sold from street carts, usually by Muslims, and is usually Halal. \"Roti thitchu\" (Thai for \"tissue\") is Thai roti canai that is fluffed up by clapping it between two hands inside a dry cloth after frying, served with a Thai-Muslim style beef curry.\n\nUnlike in Malaysia, Singapore or Indonesia, variations in Thailand tend towards the sweet rather than the spicy or savory. Popular variations include mango, banana, sugar, condensed milk, jam, peanut butter and Nutella roti, although egg roti (often with sweetened condensed milk spread over the top) is also available. Some stalls sell \"mataba\" (the equivalent of the Malaysian \"murtabak\"), though this is usually found in restaurants that sell Indian Muslim food such as biryani rice rather than at roti stalls.\n\n\n"}

Depending on origin, a nasi campur vendor might serve several side dishes, including vegetables, fish, and meats. It is a staple meal from Indonesia and popular in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and southern Thailand, and also the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia. A similar form called \"chanpurū\" exists in Okinawa.\n\nNasi campur is a ubiquitous dish around Indonesia and as diverse as the Indonesian archipelago itself, with regional variations. There is no exact rule, recipe, or definition of what makes a nasi campur, since Indonesians and by large Southeast Asians commonly consume steamed rice surrounded with side dishes consisting of vegetables and meat. As a result, the question of origin or recipe is obscure. Yet nasi campur is commonly perceived as steamed rice surrounded with dishes that might consists of vegetables and meats, served in personal portions, in contrast to tumpeng that is served in larger collective portions or rijsttafel that was presented in lavish colonial banquets.\n\nThere are several local variations throughout Southeast Asia: from Java, Bali, Malay Peninsular, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Indo colonial to Chinese Indonesian versions of nasi campur. A similar Minangkabau counterpart is called \"nasi Padang\" and prominent especially in Sumatra region.\n\nIn Bali, the mixed rice called \"Nasi campur Bali\" or simply \"nasi Bali\" is a favorite among tourists. This Balinese version of nasi campur probably is the most internationally well-known version, mostly due to the \"Bali factor\", the Balinese popularity as the island resort among international visitors. The tastes are often distinctly local, punctuated by \"basa genep\", the typical Balinese spice mix used as the base for many curry and vegetable dishes. The Balinese version of mixed rice may have grilled tuna, fried tofu, cucumber, spinach, tempe, beef cubes, vegetable curry, corn, chili sauce on the bed of rice. Mixed rice is often sold by street vendors, wrapped in a banana leaf.\n\nAs a Hindu majority island, the Balinese version might add lawar and babi guling in their nasi campur fares. Nevertheless, the halal version is available, with ayam betutu, sate lilit, and eggs to accompany the rice.\n\nIn Java, nasi campur is often called \"nasi rames\", and wide variations are available across the island. One dish that usually found in a Javanese nasi campur is fried noodle. The combination known as \"nasi rames\" is a dish created in West Java during World War II by the Indo (Eurasian) cook Truus van der Capellen, who ran the Bandung soup kitchens during (and after) the Japanese occupation. Later she opened a restaurant in the Netherlands and made the dish equally popular there.\n\nIn Yogyakarta a Javanese version of nasi campur is called \"nasi ingkung\", which consist of a whole cooked chicken dish called \"ayam ingkung\", urapan kasultan, perkedel, empal gapit, sate tusuk jiwo, and tumpeng rice.\n\nSome people who reside in Jakarta and other major cities with significant Chinese population area use the term nasi campur loosely to refer to Chinese Indonesian's nasi campur Tionghoa (i.e., Chinese-styled nasi campur), a dish of rice with an assortment of barbecued meats, such as char siew, crispy roast pork, sweet pork sausage, and pork satay. This dish is usually served with simple Chinese chicken soup or sayur asin, an Indonesian clear broth of pork bones with fermented mustard greens. However, a name for a similar dish does not exist in mainland China, Singapore, Malaysia, or even most other areas of Indonesia outside of Jakarta.\n\nIn reality, the usage of the name \"nasi campur\" here is only for marketing and convenience purposes for the locals, and should not be included in the category of nasi campur. This categorization of nasi campur makes as much sense as categorizing all buffets with rice in them as rijsttafel (or worse, nasi campur buffet) just because of the presence of any rice and assortment of dishes.\n\nThe name \"nasi campur Tionghoa\" is only a shortened version of \"\"nasi dengan daging campur cara Tionghoa\"\" (i.e. \"rice with assortment of Chinese-styled meats\"). Furthermore, most Chinese vendors and food-court stalls in the region serve only one kind of meat with rice and a bowl of broth; patrons have to order different meats as separate dishes or add-ons. Hence, in most cases, those Chinese vendors' menu refers to the specific meat accompanying plain rice, for example char siew rice or roast pork rice. The nasi campur Tionghoa in this respect, is the combo set menu of various Chinese barbecued meats.\n\nIn most cases, nasi campur refers specifically to the Indonesian and Malaysian versions of rice with assortments of side dishes. In Indonesia, it refers to any kind of rice surrounded by various dishes. In Malaysia, it refers more specifically to Malay mixed rice. In Japan, United States, and most foreign countries, nasi campur often refers to the Balinese version, while in the Netherlands it most often refers to Indo-colonial nasi rames.

They are smoky in flavor, and can be soft or very dry in texture depending on freshness. Typically, they are quite long, , but very thin, with a diameter around , and folded in two, giving them a characteristic appearance.\n\nThe name comes from the word \"kaban\", an old term used in Eastern Poland for a young male pig fattened with potatoes specially for making this kind of sausage (hence \"kabanos\" - \"made of kaban\"). The word \"kaban\" with a similar meaning is also present in other Slavic languages, e.g. it denotes a boar in Russian and Ukrainian. It was loaned into Slavic from Turkic languages.\n\nKabanosy are known to have been produced since medieval times at least, and because of their long-lasting capabilities they were considered perfect food for soldiers and travellers, which is reflected by kabanos' design traits: thinness, usually very extended length, and shape in which they are always kept. According to some historians, they were hung around neck (like a necklace), allowing any horse-mounted riders to eat on the go without stopping for a food break. For the same reason, they were also used as hiking food and are very common among Polish Highlanders. Tighter, smaller wraps of long \"kabanosy\" - as sold nowadays - were also common among foot soldiers (and travellers). Smaller \"kabanos\" wrapping allowed it to be \"worn\" on a wrist and eaten while marching.\n\nNowadays, \"kabanosy\" are made using different spices, and come in many different flavours. Before the 20th century, various spices were also being used in the production of kabanosy, giving them locally distinct tastes, which differed between various regions of Poland.\n\nProduction of \"kabanosy\" requires a minimum of 150 grams of best grade pork meat to make 100 grams of sausage, which is known today as the \"minimum of 3:2 ratio\". It happens because of the loss of some of the water contained within the meat used to prepare the raw sausage, which evaporates during the long process of meat smoking.\nNowadays almost every Polish manufacturer of kabanosy describes on the packaging at which ratio their sausage was made; for example, the manufacturer Kania states that \"157 grams of meat was used to make 100 grams of kabanosy\".\n\nThe two main types of kabanosy include a slightly \"softer\" and more common type (smoked much less, just for the taste), and a \"harder\" type (much drier than the softer ones), which are smoked for a very long time, basically until bending the sausage becomes difficult (to the point that it cracks when someone attempts to bend it). Because of the long and thorough smoking process, the \"harder kabanos\" type is extremely long-lasting and does not spoil as quickly as most other meats without preservatives.\n\nFurthermore, kabanosy are also categorized into two other main types, depending on the amount of spices used: \"hot\" (very spicy) and \"mild\" (less spicy). Both \"harder\" and \"softer\" types of kabanosy come in \"hot\" or \"mild\", since the \"hardness\" of the sausage comes only from the length of its smoking time, but otherwise the two are made of the same ingredients.\n\nAccording to modern recipes, kabanosy are currently seasoned with different spices, such as black pepper, chilli, and others. Unlike other meats, these sausages are typically eaten alone as an appetiser or are often served with cheese. Although kabanosy can be cooked with other food, they are usually served cold only. Only if no other meat were available to Polish travelers or soldiers would they then have sliced kabanos into small pieces to cook them with vegetables, buckwheat, millet, potatoes, or whatever else was available.\n\nIn recent years, some manufacturers have created sausages made with the same process as kabanosy, but have substituted the traditional pork with other meat (mainly poultry). Due to their distinct shape and look, they are often called kabanosy, too, with the addition of the name of the meat they contain, e.g. \"kabanosy z kurczaka\", \"chicken kabanosy\".\n\nAfter Polish accession to the European Union, Poland and Germany fought a trade war for 10 years over the name \"kabanos\" (due to a German claim to the traditional Polish recipe). In 2011, when Polish manufacturers submitted scientific proofs of kabanos' Polish origins from their historians, the EU finally granted the Guaranteed Traditional Speciality \"kabanos\" name to Poland. This status does not forbid manufacturers from other countries to produce and sell kabanos under that name, but demands that it is made according to specified \"time-honoured recipes.\"\n\n\n"}

In American English, kielbasa typically refers to a coarse, u-shaped smoked sausage of any kind of meat, which closely resembles the Wiejska sausage (typically pork only) in British English. \n\nThe word entered English directly from Polish ' ( or ), meaning \"sausage\". Etymological sources state that originally, the word comes from Turkic \"kol basa\", literally \"hand-pressed\", or \"kül basa\", literally \"ash-pressed\" (cognate with modern Turkish dish '), or possibly from the Hebrew \"kol basar\" (), literally meaning \"all kinds of meat;\" however, other origins are also possible.\n\nThe terms entered English simultaneously from different sources, which accounts for the different spellings. Usage varies between cultural groups and countries, but overall there is a distinction between American and Canadian usage. In New Jersey, Pennsylvania and most areas of Greater New York City, a plural Polish transitional form is used, \"\" (). Canadians also use the word \"kubasa\" ( or ), a corruption of the Ukrainian \"kovbasa\" (), and Albertans even abbreviate it as \"kubie\" to refer to the sausage eaten on a hot dog bun. In United Kingdom, the term kielbasa is not commonly used, in favor of the authentic Polish names of the different types of sausage, of which there are many. \n\nSausage is a staple of Polish cuisine and comes in dozens of varieties, smoked or fresh, made with pork, beef, turkey, lamb, chicken or veal with every region having its own speciality. Of these, the \"kiełbasa lisiecka\", produced in Małopolskie, has, since late 2010 had PGI protection. There are official Polish government guides and classifications of sausages based on size, meat, ready-to-eat or uncooked varieties.\n\nOriginally made at home in rural areas, there are a wide variety of recipes for kielbasa preparation at home and for holidays. Kielbasa is also one of the most traditional foods served at Polish weddings. Popular varieties include:\nThe most popular kiełbasa is also called \"Kiełbasa Polska\" (\"Polish Sausage\") or \"Kiełbasa Starowiejska\" (\"Old Countryside Sausage\"). This one comes closest to what is generally known in America as \"kiełbasa\" (a Polish sausage). Nowadays, many major meat packers across America offer a product called \"kiełbasa,\" usually somewhat different from the original.\n\nIn Poland, kiełbasa is often served garnished with fried onions, and – in the form of cut pieces – smoked kiełbasa can be served cold, hot, boiled, baked or grilled. It can be cooked in soups such as \"żurek\" (sour rye soup), \"kapuśniak\" (cabbage soup), or \"grochówka\" (pea soup), baked or cooked with sauerkraut, or added to bean dishes, stews (notably \"bigos\", a Polish national dish), and casseroles. Kiełbasa is also very popular served cold as cold cuts on a platter, usually for an appetizer at traditional Polish parties. It is also a common snack (\"zagrycha\") served with beer or plain vodka.\n\nA less widely encountered but equally popular variety of kiełbasa is the White Fresh (\"biała\" - i.e. \"white\"). It is mainly used as a soup meat, and is therefore sold uncooked and unsmoked. When used, it is prepared by boiling, frying or boiling in soup in place of raw meat. This kiełbasa's taste is similar to a white Thuringian sausage. Traditionally served with \"barszcz biały\".\n\nKolbász is the Hungarian word for sausage. Hungarian cuisine produces a vast number of types of sausages. The most common smoked Hungarian sausages are Gyulai Kolbász, Csabai Kolbász, Csemege Kolbász, Házi Kolbász, Cserkész Kolbász, lightly smoked, like Debreceni Kolbász (or Debreciner) and Lecsókolbász, a spicy sausage made specifically for serving as part of the dish Lecsó, a vegetable stew with peppers and tomatoes. Hungarian boiled sausage types are called \"hurka\": either liver sausage, \"májas\", or blood sausage, \"véres\". All three types of blood sausages must be ingested within 6 hours of preparation to ensure a healthy pre and post-consumption experience per Hungarian regulations. It is considered rude not to reach completion of the whole sausage in a timely fashion, though it is not considered a crime. The main ingredient is liver and rice, or blood and rice. Salt, pepper, and spices are optionally added. Butter is not.\n\nIn the United States, kielbasa which may also be referred to as \"Polish sausage\" in some areas, is widely available in grocery stores and speciality import markets. While the smoked variety is more commonly found, the uncured variety is often available, particularly in areas with large Polish populations. Several sandwiches featuring the sausage as a main ingredient have become iconic in local cuisines including Chicago's Maxwell Street Polish, Cleveland's Polish Boy, and several offerings from Primanti Brothers in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn Canada, varieties typical of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Ukraine, and elsewhere are available in supermarkets, and more specific varieties can be found in specialty shops. This type of sausage is particularly associated with the Prairie Provinces, where the Slavic cultural presence is particularly strong. The world's largest display model of a Ukrainian sausage is a roadside attraction in Mundare, Alberta, the home of Stawnichy's Meat Processing.\n\nIn Ukraine the word \"kielbasa\" is pronounced \"kovbasa\" (Ковбаса) with the accent being on the last syllable however is sometimes pronounced with a silent v, \"kobasa\". It is a general term and is used to describe a variety of sausages including \"domashnia\" (homemade kovbasa), \"pechinky\" (liver kovbasa) and \"vudzhena\" (smoked kovbasa).\nIt is predominantly eaten in the Western areas of Ukraine such as Halychnyna (Galicia), Volhynia and Bukovena (Carpathia).\n\nIt is served in a variety of ways such as fried with onions atop vareneky, sliced on rye bread, eaten with an egg and mustard sauce and lastly in \"Yayechnia z Kovbosoyu i yarnoyu\" a dish meaning fried kovbasa with red capsicum and scrambled eggs. In Ukraine kovbasa is roasted in an oven on both sides and stored in ceramic pots with lard. The sausage is often made at home however has become increasingly brought at markets and even supermarkets. Kovbasa also tends to accompany \"pysanka\" (dyed and decorated eggs) as well as the eastern Slavic bread, paska in Ukrainian baskets at Easter time and is blessed by the priest with holy water before being consumed.\n\nIn Russia it is known as колбаса (). In the Russian language the word \"kolbasa\" refers to all sausage-like meat products including salami and bologna. Similar sausages are found in other Slavic nations as well, notably the Czech Republic (spelled \"klobása\", or regionally \"klobás\"), Slovakia (spelled \"klobása\"), and Slovenia (spelled \"klobása\"). In Croatia, as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia, this sausage is called \"kobasica\" or \"kobasa\", while in Bulgaria and Macedonia it is called \"kolbas\". In Austria it is called \"Klobassa\" (similar to the neighbouring Slavic countries). In South Africa, this type of sausage is known as the \"Russian\" sausage; often deep fried, and served with chips, as fast food.\n\n\n"}

The main ingredients might be poultry, goat meat, beef, mutton, various kinds of offal, fish and seafood, and also vegetables such as cassava leaves and unripe jackfruit. The gulai sauces commonly have a thick consistency with yellowish color because of the addition of ground turmeric. Gulai sauce ingredients consist of rich spices such as turmeric, coriander, black pepper, galangal, ginger, chilli pepper, shallot, garlic, fennel, lemongrass, cinnamon and caraway, ground into paste and cooked in coconut milk with the main ingredients. Gulai is often described as an Indonesian type of curry, indeed gulai is the common name for curry dishes in the country, although Indonesian cuisine also recognize \"kari\" or \"kare\" (curry).\n\nGulai is originated in Sumatra, Indonesia and is thought to be the local adaptation of Indian curry, developed and derived from Indian influence on Indonesian cuisine. The dish is popular and widely served in the Indonesian archipelago, especially in Sumatra, Java and also Malay peninsula and Borneo. The thick and yellowish gulai sauce is one of the most common sauces in Minangkabau cuisine, to give a rich and spicy taste to meats, fish, or vegetables. Gulai often described as succulent and spicy, yet subtly combining flavors of different spices into one suave and smooth taste, that it is difficult to figure out individual spices. \n\nThe ingredients are simmered and slowly cooked in coconut milk, spice mixture and chili pepper.

{"id": "47862655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47862655", "title": "Krupuk", "text": "Krupuk\n\nKrupuk or kerupuk (Indonesian) or kroepoek (Dutch) are deep fried crackers made from starch and other ingredients that serve as flavouring. They are a popular snack in parts of Southeast Asia, but most closely associated with Indonesia. \"Kroepoek\" also can be found in the Netherlands, through their historic colonial ties with Indonesia.\n\nIn Indonesia, the term \"krupuk\" refers to the type of relatively large crackers, while the term \"kripik\" or \"keripik\" refers to smaller bite-size crackers; the counterpart of chips (or crisps) in western cuisine. For example, potato chips are called \"kripik kentang\" in Indonesia. Both terms, krupuk and kripik, sound like the breaking or crumbling of this crispy snack to denote its crispiness. Thus, the etymology of the term \"krupuk\" is an onomatopoeia in Indonesian to describe the crunch sound of this crispy snack.\n\nUsually krupuk is made from the dried paste from the mixture of starch with other ingredients, while kripik is usually made entirely from thinly sliced, sun-dried, and fried products without any mixture of starch.\n\nTo achieve maximum crunchiness, most of this pre-packed raw krupuk must be sun-dried first before being deep fried at home. To cook krupuk, a wok and plenty of very hot cooking oil is needed. A healthier fatless version might be made by briefly pulsing the raw krupuk in the microwave oven: usually one minute at the medium (~700W) power is enough to successfully puff a handful of chips. Raw krupuk is quite small, hard, and darker in color than cooked one.\n\nKrupuk and kripik can be consumed alone as a snack, or cracked and sprinkled on top of certain food as a complement to add crispy texture. Certain Indonesian dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, rujak, asinan, bubur ayam and certain kinds of soto were known to require certain type of krupuk for toppings. \"Krupuk\" is an essential ingredient to make \"seblak\", a savoury and spicy dish made of boiled wet \"krupuk\" cooked with protein sources (chicken, beef or seafood) in spicy sauce.\n\nIndonesia has perhaps the largest variety of \"krupuk\". There are many variations on krupuk, many of which are made from starch with seafood (shrimp, fish, or squid), but occasionally with rice, fruits, nuts or vegetables; these variations are more usual in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nIn Malaysia, it is called as \"keropok\" and associated with fish and seafood (other then fish and seafood are called \"kerepek\"). 3 type of keropok in Malaysia is Keropok kering, Keropok lekor and amplang. Keropok Lekor, originated from Terengganu and Amplang from the coastal towns of Semporna and Tawau in Sabah which is also can be found in Kalimantan. While keropok kering can be found in most of Malaysia states Mukah town in Sarawak also historically known as a fishing town for the making of \"Keropok\".\n\nThere are varieties of keropok lekor, amplang and keropok kering in Malaysia.\n\nKrupuk, is most commonly known as 'kropek' and 'kropeck' in the Philippines, but is sometimes also referred to as 'fish crackers', 'prawn crackers' or less commonly as 'fish chicharron', which is technically fried fish skin. But in the Philippines some forms of chicharron are not made with animal products at all, rather they are made with tapioca starch and green peas, hence the term 'fish chicharron' came to be. It's debatable if the vegetarian, kropek like 'mock pork cracklin' could be considered a form of kropek, since there are a lot of similarities but also differences which make them two, be it separate, but comparable snacks. They are sold at sari-sari stores in smaller portions, suitable for kids or people who are looking for a light snack, as well as in bigger bags at local supermarkets and convenience stores.\n\nKropek is eaten as an appetizer, with a vinegar and chili dipping sauce, sometimes as accompaniment at drinking sessions, or paired with a meal. There are a lot of local brands which sell 'kropek' all with their own touch. However, some of the most popular and well known brands in the Philippines are the 'La La Fish Crackers' and Oishi renowned for their prawn crackers, fish crackers and fish kropeck. Oishi, being a Philippines-based company, which has expanded all across Asia, making it not only one of the biggest Filipino brands, but one of the biggest Asian companies.\n\nThese are similar crackers, however commonly not considered as krupuk.\n\nIn Indonesia, major producing centres of krupuk usually are coastal fishing towns. Sidoarjo in East Java, Cirebon and Garut in West Java, Karimun Jawa island, Padang, Palembang and Medan in Sumatra, Bangka Island, Samarinda and Pontianak in Kalimantan, and Makassar in Sulawesi are major producers of krupuk, and many recipes originate from there.\n\nMost of the coastal towns in Malaysia such as Mukah, Malacca Town, Pangkor Island and Lumut produce keropok from large scale manufacturing to small scale home factories.\n\n"}
{"id": "47862657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47862657", "title": "Rojak", "text": "Rojak\n\nRojak (Malay spelling) or Rujak (Indonesian spelling) is a traditional fruit and vegetable salad dish from Southeast Asia, commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Other than referring to this fruit salad dish, the term \"rojak\" also means \"mixture\" or \"eclectic mix\" in colloquial Malay.\n\nRujak is available everywhere across Indonesia, and there are rich variations within the country. However, the most popular rujak variant is \"rujak buah\" (fruit rujak), which is mixed sliced fruit and vegetables served with spicy palm sugar dressing. Unlike common fruit salads, rujak is often described as tangy and spicy fruit salad, due to its sweet, hot and spicy dressing made from ground chili pepper, palm sugar and peanuts. It is a popular street fare in Bali.\n\nIndonesian rujak is usually made from fresh ingredients, especially fruits and vegetables. Rojak in Malaysia and Singapore, however, is mostly of Indian influence, mixed with fried tofu, cracker, cruller and fritter. Rujak is usually a vegetarian dish which does not contain any animal products, except the sweet and tangy dressing that might contain shrimp paste. Nevertheless, some recipes may contain seafood or meat. Rojak in Malaysia and Singapore usually contains \"sotong\" (cuttlefish), while certain rujak recipes in Indonesia may contain seafood or meat.\n\nThe origin of rujak is unclear, and there are numbers of rujak variants in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia. It is possible that since ancient times, the natives of the Malay archipelago have consumed sour-tasting seasonal tropical fruits—especially Java apple, kedondong and young mango—together with palm sugar and salt, to ease its sourness. In Indonesia, certain fruit plants have their own fruit-bearing season, usually within late dry season to the wet season, thus the time of fruit harvest usually coincides with the time of having rujak in Indonesian villages. The fruit species seasonally anticipated for rujak feasts are mango, Java apple and kedondong.\n\nRujak is one of the oldest dish, and the earliest historically identified food of ancient Java. It was mentioned as \"rurujak\" in ancient Javanese Taji inscription (901 CE) from the era of Mataram Kingdom in Central Java. The Javanese in Indonesia have incorporated rujak into their prenatal ceremony called \"Naloni Mitoni\". According to local traditions, young mango and other sour-tasting fruits are craved by pregnant women, apparently as the counterpart of pickles in the West.\n\nThe introduction of hot and spicy chili pepper and peanuts may have taken place during the early colonial era in the 16th century, since these products were brought by Spanish and Portuguese traders from the Americas. It's suggested that rujak might be related to Indonesian \"gado-gado\", while the rojak in Malaysia and Singapore demonstrate Indian influences with orange-colored peanut sauce as a dip for fried dough and potatoes.\n\nIn Indonesia, rujak is a traditional fare, sold in traditional marketplaces, \"warungs\" or travelling \"gerobak\" pushcart by locals; especially Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese people. In Malaysia, rojak is associated with Mamak stall, which is a Muslim Malaysian Indian foodstall, where Mamak rojak is one of its popular fares. In Singapore, rojak is typically sold by Chinese hawkers. Today, they are sold in most hawker centre in the city.\n\nIn Indonesia, among the Javanese, rujak is an essential part of the traditional prenatal ceremony called \"tujuh bulanan\" (literally: seventh month). The ritual was meant to wish the mother-to-be a safe, smooth and successful labour. Special fruit rujak is made for this occasion, and later served to the mother-to-be and her guests, primarily her female friends. It is widely known that the sweet, spicy and sour tastes of rojak are adored by pregnant women. The recipe of rujak for this ceremony is similar to typical Indonesian fruit rujak, with the exceptions that the fruits are roughly shredded instead of thinly sliced, and that \"jeruk bali\" (pomelo/pink grapefruit) is an essential ingredient. It is believed that if the rujak overall tastes sweet, the unborn would be a girl, and if it is spicy, the unborn baby is a boy.\n\nMangarabar, or rujak making, is a special event for the inhabitants of the Batak Mandailing region in Tapanuli, North Sumatra, Indonesia, after the harvest. Normally the whole village will be involved in making and consuming the rujak.\n\nIn Malaysia and Singapore, the term \"rojak\" is also used as a colloquial expression for an eclectic mix, in particular as a word describing the multi-ethnic character of Malaysian and Singaporean society.\n\n\"Rujak buah\" is Indonesian fruit rujak, also known as \"rujak manis\" (sweet rujak). The typical Indonesian fruit rujak consists of slices of assorted tropical fruits such as \"jambu air\" (water apple), pineapple, raw mangos, \"bengkoang\" (jicama), cucumber, kedondong, and raw red \"ubi jalar\" (sweet potato). Sometimes Malang variants of green apple, belimbing (starfruit), and jeruk Bali (pomelo) are added. The sweet and spicy-hot bumbu rujak dressing is made of water, \"gula jawa\" (palm sugar), \"asem jawa\" (tamarind), ground sauteed peanuts, \"terasi\" (shrimp paste), salt, bird's eye chili, and red chili pepper. All of the fruits are sliced to bite-size, and put in the dish.\n\nThe \"bumbu rujak\" or thick sweet spicy rujak dressing is poured on the fruit slices. An addition of \"sambal garam\" powder (simple mixture of salt and ground red chilli) is put on side as the alternative for those who prefer a salty taste for their rujak. The Javanese people call this kind of rujak as \"lotis\".\n\nRujak cuka literally means \"vinegared rujak\", it is a specialty of Sundanese cuisine of West Java, noted for its sour freshness. It is made of shredded fruits; including young mango, pineapple, jicama, and vegetables; cabbages, beansprouts and cucumber. It is quite similar to \"asinan\", especially its sour and spicy dressing, since both employ vinegar, palm sugar, and chili pepper.\n\nThis is another variant of Indonesian fruit rujak. The ingredients are almost the same as typical Indonesian fruit rujak, with the exception that all the ingredients are being ground or mashed together (\"tumbuk\" or \"bèbèk\" in Indonesian) in a wooden mortar. The fruits being ground are young/green \"pisang batu\" (a species of banana), raw red yam, jicama, Java apple, \"kedondong\" and young unripe mango. The dressing is not poured on the fruit, but already mixed together with all the ingredients. The dressing contains \"terasi\" shrimp paste, palm sugar, salt, and birds-eye chili. Traditionally, rujak tumbuk is served in individual smaller portions on banana leaf plates called \"pincuk\", however today it is commonly served in plastic cups.\n\nThis literally means \"shredded rujak\", and is another variant of Indonesian fruit rujak. As with rujak tumbuk, the ingredients are similar to Indonesian fruit rujak, with the exceptions that the fruits are not cut into bite-sized pieces, but shredded into a roughly grated consistency.\n\nA delicacy from Aceh province, this rujak consists of very young and tender coconut meat, young (green) papaya, bird's eye chili, sugar, palm sugar, ice, salt, and a dash of lime. Best eaten cold.\n\n\"Pengantin\" means bride/groom in Indonesian. This rujak is reminiscent of Indonesia's colonial cuisine. It contains slices of boiled eggs, potatoes, fried tofu, pineapple, carrot, bean sprout, pickles, chili, lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, emping crackers, roasted peanuts, peanut sauce and has a little vinegar to it. Some variants mixed the peanut sauce with mayonnaise. It is somewhat like Central Javanese gado-gado.\n\nA Balinese snack, a variation of the Indonesian fruit rujak, but instead of the normal rujak dressing, the fruits are soaked in a spiced fish broth. The broth consists of terasi (shrimp paste), salt, bird's eye chili, and red chili pepper and fish broth.\n\n\"Cingur\" literally means \"mouth\" in Javanese, \"cingur\" (pronounced: \"ching-oor\") is a variant of rujak from Surabaya. This specialty rujak from East Java has a \"meaty\" taste. It contains slices of cooked buffalo or cow lips, \"bangkuang\", young raw mango, pineapple, cucumber, \"kangkung\", lontong (rice cake), tofu and tempe, all served in a black sauce made from \"petis\" (black fermented shrimp paste, related to terasi), and ground peanuts. It is topped with a sprinkle of fried shallots and kerupuk (Indonesian shrimp crackers).\n\nThis is another variant of rujak from Surabaya. It contains slices of bangkuang, unripe raw mango, cucumber, \"kangkung\", \"kedondong\", tofu, and soybean sprouts all served in a black sauce made from petis (sticky black fermented shrimp paste, related to terasi), fried shallots, salt, palm sugar, unripe banana, and ground peanuts. Traditionally it is served on a banana leaf, but today it is more commonly served on plates.\n\nSimilar to fruit rujak, and also from Surabaya. Aside from unripe fruits the rojak also includes fried tofu, fried garlic and optionally beef tendons. The sauce is petis-based mixed with palm sugar, slices of raw bird's eye chili, and sweet soy sauce.\n\n\"Juhi\" means salted cuttlefish in Indonesian; this rujak contains fried \"tau kwa\" tofu, fried boiled potatoes, fried shredded salted cuttlefish, cucumber, noodles, lettuce, cabbages, peanut sauce, vinegar, chili, and fried garlic. This dish was originated from Chinese community in Batavia (now Jakarta) and now has become the Betawi dish closely related with \"Asinan Betawi\".\n\nNamed after \"Bioscoop Shanghay\" (a cinema named after Shanghai, China's most populated city) In Batavia Kota area, this dish was created by Indonesia's Chinese community. This variant of rujak can be found in Indonesian Chinatowns in cities such as Glodok in Jakarta. Rujak Shanghai contains seafood, like Rujak Juhi. Boiled and sliced \"gurita\" (octopus) and also edible jellyfish, are served with \"kangkung\" (a leafy green water plant commonly used as vegetable), and served with thick red sweet and sour sauce, mixed with pineapple juice, and sauteed ground peanuts. Usually chili sauce and pickled \"bengkoang\" are served as condiments.\n\nA delicacy from Banyuwangi, East Java, a unique blend between beef soto and rujak cingur. A local specialty in which the vegetables (water spinach and beansprouts) rujak served with \"lontong\" rice cake in petis sauce poured with soto soup. It was created in 1975 by Usni Solihin.\n\nIn Malaysia, mamak rojak (or Pasembur) contains fried dough fritters, bean curds, boiled potatoes, prawn fritters, hard boiled eggs, bean sprouts, cuttlefish and cucumber mixed with a sweet thick, spicy peanut sauce. origins is made in kedah by Malay villagers, later having learn the recipe from them, Tamil Muslim (Mamak) rojak vendors used modified sidecar motorcycles as preparation counters and to peddle their rojak. Later it became popularly known as Rojak Mamak. These mobile vendors now use modified mini trucks. The Pasembor available in Singapore is an assortment of potatoes, eggs, bean curd (tofu), and prawns fried in batter, served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce. In the Northwest Peninsular Region (Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Perak), it is always called pasembor, but in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore it is called rojak.\n\nSold by the Chinese, the Chinese fruit rojak consists typically of cucumber, pineapple, \"benkoang\" (jicama), bean sprouts, taupok (puffy, deep-fried tofu) and youtiao (cut-up Chinese-style fritters). Raw mangos and green apples are less commonly used. The dressing is made up of water, belacan (shrimp paste), sugar, chili, and lime juice. Ingredients vary among vendors with some also using \"hae ko\" prawn/shrimp paste, tamarind or black bean paste in the mix. The ingredients are cut into bite-sized portions and tossed in a bowl with the dressing and topped with chopped peanuts and a dash of ground or finely chopped bunga kantan (pink ginger bud).\n\nRojak Penang is another type of Rojak found in Penang, Malaysia. It is similar to fruit rojak, but adds jambu air, guava, squid fritters and honey to the mixture, emphasizes on the use of tart fruits such as raw mangoes and green apples, and usually omits the bean sprouts and fried tofu puffs. The sauce or dressing for the rojak tends to be very thick, almost toffee-like in consistency and texture.\n\nRecently sotong kangkung has become so famous in Malaysia, that you can find it at most of the rojak stalls. Sotong kangkung contains sotong (cuttlefish), kangkung (water spinach), cucumbers, bean curds, peanuts, chili and sauce.\n\n"}

It is very similar to gado-gado, except all the vegetables are raw, while most of gado-gado vegetables are boiled, and it uses kencur, Thai basil and eggplant. Karedok is also known as lotek atah (raw lotek or raw gado-gado) for its fresh and raw version of the vegetable covered with peanut sauce.

In 2018, \"gado-gado\" is promoted as one of 5 national dishes of Indonesia.\n\nThe term \"gado\" or the verb \"menggado\" means to consume something without rice. \"Gado-gado\" in Indonesian literally means \"mix-mix\" since it is made of rich mixture of vegetables such as potatoes, longbeans, bean sprouts, spinach, chayote, bitter gourd, corn and cabbage, with tofu, tempeh and hard-boiled eggs, all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with \"krupuk\" and sprinkles of fried shallots. \"Gado-gado\" is different from \"lotek atah\" or \"karedok\" which uses raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese \"pecel\".\n\n\"Gado-gado\" is widely sold in almost every part of Indonesia, with each area having its own modifications. It is thought to have originally been a Sundanese dish, as it is most prevalent in Western parts of Java (which includes Jakarta, Banten, and West Java provinces). The Javanese have their own slightly similar version of a vegetables-in-peanut-sauce dish called \"pecel\" which is more prevalent in Central and East Java. \"Gado-gado\" is widely available from hawkers' carts, stalls (\"warung\") and restaurants and hotels in Indonesia; it is also served in Indonesian-style restaurants worldwide. Though it is customarily called a salad, the peanut sauce is a larger component of \"gado-gado\" than is usual for the dressings in Western-style salads; the vegetables should be well coated with it.\n\nSome eating establishments use different mixtures of peanut sauce, such as adding cashew nuts for taste. In Jakarta, some eating establishment boast \"gado-gado\" as their signature dish, some of which have been in business for decades and have developed faithful clientele. Gado-Gado Boplo restaurant chain for example has been around since 1970, while Gado-Gado Bonbin in Cikini has been around since 1960.\n\nThe sauce is made of fried crushed savory peanuts, sweet palm sugar, garlic, chilies, salt, tamarind and a squeeze of lime. Gado-gado is generally freshly made, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their personal preference for the degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the amount of chili pepper included. However, particularly in the West, \"gado-gado\" sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk. \"Gado-gado\" sauce is also available in dried form, which simply needs to be rehydrated by adding hot water.\n\n\"Gado-gado\" sauce is not to be confused with satay sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.\n\nMost of flavours in gado-gado are acquired from the mixture of its \"bumbu kacang\" or peanut salad dressing. Gado-gado perfectly combines a slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes. The common primary ingredients of the peanut sauce are as follows:\n\n\nThe traditional method of making \"gado-gado\" is to use the \"cobek\" (pestle) and \"ulekan\" or flat rounded stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids is added to achieve the desired consistency.\n\nThe composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the following:\nOutside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available.\nAll the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, except for the tempeh and tofu, which is fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh. The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the peanut sauce.\n\nIn Indonesia \"gado-gado\" is commonly served mixed with chopped \"lontong\" or \"ketupat\" (glutinous rice cake), or with steamed rice served separately. It is nearly always served with \"krupuk\" (crackers), e.g. tapioca crackers or \"emping\", Indonesian style fried crackers, which are made from \"melinjo\". A common garnish is \"bawang goreng\" a finely-chopped fried shallot sprinkles.\n\n"}

However, they are more varied and commonly found in Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nNext to \"krupuk udang\" (prawn cracker), \"krupuk ikan\" (fish cracker) is also a favourite snack, as both are popular \"krupuk\" types known in Indonesia. \"Tenggiri\" (wahoo) and \"cakalang\" (skipjack tuna) probably are the most popular fish used for fish crackers. Nevertheless, any other edible fishes, such as \"bawal\" (pomfret) and \"ekor kuning\" (\"Caesionidae\") might also be used.\n\nCirebon in West Java and Palembang in South Sumatra are famous for their unique fish crackers that use \"tengiri\". Some coastal fishing towns and cities in Indonesia has developed their own recipes and types. \"Kemplang\" for example is associated with Southern Sumatra region, from Lampung, Palembang, to Bangka island. While \"amplang\" is associated with coastal Borneo, from Samarinda, Balikpapan, Banjarmasin, to Pontianak. In Palembang, fish crackers are usually eaten with \"pempek\" fish cake in \"kuah cuko\" or sweet, spicy and sour vinegar based sauce.\n\nCoastal fishing towns are traditionally known as the production centers of fish crackers. In Indonesia, fish cracker are produced in Bangka and Belitung island, Cirebon in West Java, Juwana in Central Java, and Sidoarjo in East Java. Major coastal cities such as Palembang, Bandar Lampung, Medan, Makassar, Pontianak and Samarinda are also a major production centers.\n\nIt is a favourite snack in Malaysia and its neighbouring countries, and there are several fish cracker producers that are operating in the coastal areas of Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, Johor, Kedah, Sabah and Sarawak. The types of fish that normally used to process these fish crackers are the \"Wolf herring\" (Ikan parang), \"Sardines\" (Ikan tamban), \"Round scad\" (Ikan selayang), \"Threadfin bream\" (Ikan kerisi), \"Ox-eyed scad\" (Ikan lolong bara), \"Goatfish\" (Ikan biji nangka), \"Lizard fish\" (Ikan conor) and many others.\n\nHistorically, Mukah town in Sarawak is known as a fishing town for the making of fish crackers.\n"}

Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, onions, beans, peppers, mushrooms, and tomatoes) and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef. Poultry, sausages, and seafood are also used. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. Seasoning and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle.\n\nStewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow moist heat method. This makes it popular in low-cost cooking. Cuts having a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry.\n\nStews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing, or by using a roux or \"beurre manié\", a dough consisting of equal parts of fat and flour. Thickeners like cornstarch or arrowroot may also be used.\n\nStews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two. Generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat. While soups are almost always served in a bowl, stews may be thick enough to be served on a plate with the gravy as a sauce over the solid ingredients.\n\nStews have been made since ancient times. The world's oldest evidence of stew was found in Japan, also the place of the origin of fishing equipment. Herodotus says that the Scythians (8th to 4th centuries BC) \"put the flesh into an animal's paunch, mix water with it, and boil it like that over the bone fire. The bones burn very well, and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off. In this way an ox, or any other sacrificial beast, is ingeniously made to boil itself.\"\n\nAmazonian tribes used the shells of turtles as vessels, boiling the entrails of the turtle and various other ingredients in them. Other cultures used the shells of large mollusks (clams etc.) to boil foods in. There is archaeological evidence of these practices going back 8,000 years or more. \n\nThere are recipes for lamb stews and fish stews in the Roman cookery book \"Apicius\", believed to date from the 4th century AD. \"Le Viandier\", one of the oldest cookbooks in French, written in the early 14th century by the French chef known as Taillevent, has ragouts or stews of various types in it.\n\nThe first written reference to 'Irish stew' is in Byron's \"The Devil's Drive\" (1814): \"The Devil ... dined on ... a rebel or so in an Irish stew.\"\n\nIn meat-based stews, white stews, also known as \"blanquettes\" or \"fricassées\", are made with lamb or veal that is blanched, or lightly seared without browning, and cooked in stock. Brown stews are made with pieces of red meat that are first seared or browned, before a browned mirepoix and sometimes browned flour, stock and wine are added.\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally served as a dinner course, usually as either the appetizer, soup or dessert, on warm summer nights or for hot summer luncheons. The soup is cooked with whole sour cherries, including the pits. Sour cherry trees are numerous in Hungary, and the soup is a good example of the quintessentially Hungarian fusion of Eastern/Asian influences and traditional Continental European cuisine. It is customary that the soup contain fresh sour cherries, fresh cream and sometimes cloves and cinnamon.

The name originates from the (Romanian) \"plăcintă (clătită)\" (lit. \"rinsed pie\"), referring to the runny dough used for the recipe.\n\nNames of the dish include \"Palaçinka\" (Albanian), \"Palatschinke\" (pl. \"Palatschinken\") (Austrian German), \"palačinka\" / \"палачинка\" (Bulgarian, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, Slovene, Macedonian), \" naleśnik\" (Polish), \"palacinka\" (Slovak), \"palacinka\" (Italiano) and \"palacsinta\" (Hungarian).\n\nCentral European Palatschinke (\"palačeke\") are thin pancakes similar to the French \"crêpe\". The main difference between the French and Central European version of the dish is that the mixture for palatschinken can be used straight away unlike that of crepes which is suggested to be left at rest for several hours. Palatschinken are made by creating a runny dough from eggs, wheat flour, milk, and salt and frying it in a pan with butter or oil. Unlike thicker types of pancakes, palatschinken are usually served with different types of fillings and eaten for lunch or dinner.\n\nPalatschinken are traditionally rolled with apricot, strawberry, or plum jam, and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. A variety of fruit sauces (like apple sauce), or thick fruit jams called \"lekvar\" (plum, prune, raspberry, cherry or sour cherry jam), lemon juice and sugar, chocolate sauce, hazelnut-chocolate cream (Nutella), almonds, dried or fresh fruits, sweet cottage or quark cheese and raisins, cocoa powder, poppy seed, or any combination thereof, may also be used. \"Rakott palacsinta\" are layered pancakes with sweet cottage cheese and raisins, jam and walnut layers between the pancakes, baked in the oven, comparable to the French \"mille crêpe\".\n\nA well known Hungarian version of palatschinke is the Gundel pancake (\"Gundel palacsinta\"), made with ground walnuts, raisin, candied orange peel, cinnamon, and rum filling, served flambéed in dark chocolate sauce made with egg yolks, heavy cream, and cocoa.\n\nPalatschinken may also be eaten unsweetened as a main course, such as a meat-filled Hortobágyi palacsinta. They may also be eaten plain, filled with cheeses, or vegetables such as mushroom, spinach or sauerkraut, topped with sour cream, or cut into thin strips, called \"Flädle\" in Germany′s and Switzerland's Alemannic dialects and \"Frittaten\" in Austria. \"Flädle\"/\"Frittaten\" are used in \"Frittaten\" soup - pancake strips served in clear broth.\n\nThe dish originates from Romania, and the origin of its name is the Romanian \"plăcintă clătită\" (lit. \"a rinsed/runny pie\"), which ultimately derives from Latin \"placenta\" (\"a flat cake\"), itself a word of Greek origin. In Romanian, the term refers to the runny mixture used for the recipe and how it behaves in the pan; in common parlance, the name of the dish has been shortened only to \"clătită\", turning what was once an adjective (\"rinsed\", \"runny\") into a noun. The Romanian meaning is similar with one of the Ancient Greek name of the dish, \"tagenites\", derived from the Greek word for the frying pan.\n\nThe name of the dish has followed a track of borrowing across several languages of central and south-eastern Europe. Austrian-German term \"Palatschinke(n)\" is deemed to have been borrowed from Czech \"palačinka\", that in turn from Hungarian \"palacsinta\". \"Palačinka\" is also the name in most West and South Slavic languages (Slovak \"palacinka\", Bulgarian, Czech, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian \"palačinka\", \"палачинка\"). In Polish, the equivalent is called a \"naleśnik\", in Ukrainian \"налисник\" (\"nalysnyk\") or \"млинець\" (\"mlynec\"), in Russian \"налистник\" (\"nalistnik\") or \"блинчик\" (\"blinchik\").\n\n\n"}

With its generous use of hot paprika, halászlé is arguably one of the hottest (spicy hot) dishes native to the European continent.\nThe dish is a famous soup, and often consumed by tourists and locals. An important ingredient in Fisherman's Soup is in the court-bouillon, which adds significant flavor. To prepare the soup base, fish trimmings are used, fresh carp heads, bones, skin and fins. These are boiled with water, salt and vegetables (red onions, green peppers and tomatoes) for two hours. When ready, the court bouillon is strained. Hot ground paprika and two finger-thick carp fillets, the roe and coral is added, ten minutes before serving, to the boiling soup.\n\nFisherman's Soup variations\n\nTraditionally, the soup is prepared in small kettles on open fire on the river banks by fishermen. Fisherman's soup in kettle is prepared with fresh fish on the place. When prepared in kettles, first, chopped onion is fried in the kettle with some oil until it is caramelized. Then, ground \"paprika\" is added and the kettle is filled with water. When the water comes to a boil, other spices (such as black pepper, white wine, tomato juice) are added, and finally the fish, chopped into large pieces. Entire fish, including heads and tails, are often added to the soup. The soup is usually prepared with mixed fish, the most common species are common carp, catfish, perch and pike. Depending on the amount of added hot paprika the soup is mildly to very hot. The Hungarian soup is famous for being very hot and spicy.\n\nThe soup is served directly from the kettle and eaten with bread (the spicier the soup, the more bread is required).\n\nMany people, especially fishermen, regard the preparation of fish soup as somewhat secretive. Although the recipe is basically simple, the \"right\" ratio of spices, onion, fish (its quality and variety) and water, as well as timing, affect the soup taste significantly. Many dedicated fishermen regarded their recipe as a highly-kept secret.\n\nCompetitions in preparing the soup are popular and are usually held at fairs along river coast. Visitors are offered to taste the soup for money or for free; the quality is determined by public or committee and (un)success of competitors is often subject of mutual teasing.\n\nThe soup is best accompanied by dry white wine (such as Riesling), which may be diluted with soda water. The combination of wine and soda water (a wine spritzer) is called \"fröccs\" in Hungarian.\n\nThe Fisherman's soup or halászlé is a traditional dish for Christmas Eve dinner in Hungary.\n\n\n"}

Alternative spellings and names include \"parantha\", \"parauntha\", \"prontha\", \"parontay\" (in Punjabi), \"porota\" (in Bengali), \"palata\" (; in Burma), \"porotha\" (in Assamese), \"forota\" (in Sylheti) and \"farata\" (in Mauritius, Sri Lanka and the Maldives).\n\nThe Hindustani word \"paratha\" is derived from Sanskrit (S. पर, or परा+स्थः, or स्थितः). Recipes for various stuffed wheat puranpolis (which Achaya (2003) describes as parathas) are mentioned in \"Manasollasa\", a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. However, Puran poli is a separate bread. Earlier references to paratha have been mentioned by Nijjar (1968), in his book Panjāb under the sultāns, 1000-1526 A.D. when he writes that parauthas were common with the nobility and aristocracy in the Punjab.\n\nAccording to Banerji (2010), parathas are associated with Punjabi and North Indian cooking. The Punjabi method is to stuff parathas with a variety of stuffings. However, Banerji states, Mughals were also fond of parathas which gave raise to the Dhakai paratha, multilayered and flaky, taking its name from Dhaka in Bangladesh. O'Brien (2003) suggests that it is not correct to state that the Punjabi paratha was popularised in Delhi after the 1947 Partition as the Punjabi item was prevalent in Delhi before then.\n\nParathas are one of the most popular unleavened flat breads in the India part of the Indian Subcontinent and they are made by baking or cooking whole wheat dough on a tava, and finishing off with shallow frying. Parathas are thicker and more substantial than chapatis/rotis and this is either because, in the case of a \"plain paratha\", they have been layered by coating with ghee or oil and folding repeatedly (much like the method used for puff pastry or some types of Turkish börek) using a laminated dough technique; or else because food ingredients such as mixed vegetables have been mixed in with the dough, such as potato or cauliflower, green beans and carrots. A Rajasthani mung bean paratha uses both the layering technique together with mung dal mixed into the dough. While some so-called \"stuffed parathas\" resemble a filled pie squashed flat and shallow fried, using two discs of dough sealed around the edges. Then by alternatively using a single disc of dough to encase a ball of filling and sealed with a series of pleats pinched into the dough round the top, gently flattened with the palm against the working surface before being rolled into a circle. Most stuffed parathas are not layered.\n\nParathas can be eaten as a breakfast dish or as a tea-time (tiffin) snack. The flour used is finely ground wholemeal (atta) and the dough is shallow fried.\n\nPerhaps the most common stuffing for parathas is mashed, spiced potatoes (\"aloo ka parantha\") followed perhaps by dal (lentils). Many other alternatives exist such as leaf vegetables, radishes, cauliflower or paneer. A paratha (especially a stuffed one) can be eaten simply with a pat of butter spread on top or with chutney, pickles, ketchup, dahi or a raita or with meat or vegetable curries. Some roll the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea, often dipping the paratha.\n\nTo achieve the layered dough for plain parathas, a number of different traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding back and forth like a paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the tava and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas. Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.\n\nThe paratha is an important part of a traditional breakfast from the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it is made using ghee but oil is also used. Some people may even bake it in the oven for health reasons. Usually the paratha is eaten with dollops of white butter on top of it. Side dishes which go very well with paratha are curd, fried egg, omelette, Mutton kheema (ground mutton cooked with vegetables and spices), nihari (a lamb dish), jeera aloo (potatoes lightly fried with cumin seeds), daal, and raita as part of a breakfast meal. It may be stuffed with potatoes, paneer, onions, qeema or chili peppers.\n\n\n\nThe process of layering the \"skins\" of dough in a paratha can make preparation a difficult process. This, mixed with the popularity of this flatbread, has opened the market to several ranges of frozen paratha, especially in Western markets where consumers seek authenticity, but lack the time or the skills required to make a paratha from scratch. Ready-to-cook paratha may also be purchased. These preparations offer one-step preparation and save time. Some of the ready-to-cook products in the market are just the stuffings for making the stuffed parathas.\n"}

The term is also used for various soups prepared from these pulses. These pulses are among the most important staple foods in South Asian countries, and form an important part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe most common way of preparing dal is in the form of a soup to which onions, tomatoes, and various spices may be added. \nThe outer hull may or may not be stripped off. Almost all types of dal come in three forms: (1) unhulled or \"sabut\" (meaning whole in Hindi), e.g., \"sabut urad dal\" or \"mung sabut\"; (2) split with hull left on the split halves is described as \"chilka\" (which means skin in Hindi), e.g. \"chilka urad dal\", \"mung dal chilka\"; (3) split and hulled or \"dhuli\" (meaning washed), e.g., \"urad dhuli\" or \"mung dhuli\" in Hindi/Urdu. The term \"dal\" is sometimes contrasted with the term \"gram\", used by English speakers in the Indian subcontinent for pulses that are whole rather than split.\n\nDal is frequently eaten with flatbreads such as \"rotis\" or \"chapatis,\" or with rice. The later combination is called \"dal bhat\" in Bengal. In addition, certain types of dal are fried and salted and eaten as a dry snack, and an almost infinite variety of savory snacks are made by frying a paste made from soaked and ground dals in different combinations, to which spices, nuts, cashews, etc. may be added.\n\nThe word \"dāl\" derives from the Sanskrit verbal root \"dal-\" \"to split\".\n\nDal preparations are eaten with rice, roti, chapati, and naan on the Indian subcontinent. The manner in which it is cooked and presented varies by region. In South India, dal is primarily used to make the dish called sambar. It is also used to make pappu that is mixed with charu and rice.\n\nIn a 100-gram amount, cooked (boiled) dal contains 9% protein, 70% water, 20% carbohydrates (includes 8% fiber), and 1% fat. Cooked dal (per 100 g) also supplies a rich content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamin, folate (45% DV) and manganese (25% DV), with moderate amounts of thiamine (11% DV) and several dietary minerals, such as iron (19% DV) and phosphorus (18% DV).\n\nNote: All nutrient values including protein are in %DV per 100 grams of the food item. Significant values are highlighted in light gray color and bold letters.\nCooking reduction = % Maximum typical reduction in nutrients due to boiling without draining for ovo-lacto-vegetables group.\n\n\n\nAlthough dal generally refers to split pulses, whole pulses can be referred to as \"sabit dhal\" and split pulses as \"dhuli dhal\". The hulling of a pulse is intended to improve digestibility and palatability, but, as milling of whole grains into refined grains, affects the nutrition provided by the dish, reducing dietary fibre content. Pulses with their outer hulls intact are also quite popular in the Indian subcontinent as the main cuisine. Over 50 different varieties of pulses are known in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nMost dal recipes are quite simple to prepare. The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some turmeric, salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process. In some recipes, tomatoes, tamarind, unripe mango, or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sour flavour.\n\nThe fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including \"chaunk\", \"tadka\" and \"tarka\". The ingredients in the \"chaunk\" for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices (turmeric, coriander, red chili powder, \"garam masala\", etc.) are added. The \"chaunk\" is then poured over the cooked dal.\n\n"}

It is a common street food in southern India, especially in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the neighboring country of Sri Lanka. Parotta was introduced from Tamil Nadu to Malaysia by Tamil Indians and Sri Lankan Moor working in the Tuticorin harbour in the 1970s, from which it spread across the state to neighbouring states. Parottas are usually available as street food and in restaurants across Kerala, Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. At some places it is also served at weddings, religious festivals and feasts. It is prepared by kneading maida flour, egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten into thin layers and later forming a round spiralled into a ball using these thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and pan fried.\n\nUsually, parottas are eaten with vegetable kurma or chicken, mutton or beef \"saalna\" (a spicy curry). Chilli parotta and kothu parotta are prepared using parottas.\n\nSimilar to any food product made from Maida (refined flour), Parotta / Malbari Paratha/ Porotta is considered unhealthy by many, including doctors. This has resulted in the introduction and popularization of \"atta porotta\", which is porotta fully made from atta (whole wheat flour) that have been used mainly in the Second World War.\n\n\n"}

Different types of vadas can be described variously as fritters, cutlets, doughnuts, or dumplings. Alternative names for this food include wada, vade, vadai, wadeh and bara.\n\nThe various types of vadas are made from different ingredients, ranging from legumes (such as medu vada of South India) to potatoes (such as batata vada of West India). They are often served as a breakfast item or a snack, and also used in other food preparations (such as dahi vada and vada pav).\n\nAccording to K. T. Achaya, Vadai (Vada) was popular among ancient Tamils during 100 BCE-300 CE. A type of vada is mentioned as \"vataka\" in \"Manasollasa\", a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. In this recipe, green beans are soaked, de-skinned, and ground to a paste. The paste is shaped into balls and deep-fried. Early literature from present-day Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also mentions \"bara\" (vada) and \"mungaura\" (a vada made from mung).\n\nVadai (Vada) may be made from legumes, sago or potatoes. Commonly used legumes include pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram and green gram. Vegetables and other ingredients are added to improve taste and nutritive value.\n\nFor legume-based vadas, the legumes (\"dal\") are soaked with water, and then ground to a batter. The batter is then seasoned with other ingredients, such as cumin seeds, onion, curry leaves (sometimes previously sauteed), salt, chillies or black pepper grains. Often ginger and baking soda are added to the seasoning in shops to increase the fluffy texture and improve fermentation for large batches. The mixture is then shaped and deep-fried, resulting in vadas with a crispy skin and fluffy centre. The preparation of \"kalmi\" vadas involves cutting the resulting product into pieces and re-frying them.\n\nVadas are often eaten as snacks or as an accompaniment to another dish. In restaurants, they can be ordered as an à la carte item, but are not the main course. They are preferably eaten freshly fried, while still hot and crunchy. They are served with a variety of dips including sambar, watery or dry chutneys and dahi (yogurt, often called \"curd\" in Indian English).\n\nMedu vadas are typically served along with a main course such as dosa, idli, or pongal. Sambar and coconut chutneys are the standard accompaniments for medu vadas.\n\nThe various types of vadas include:\n\n\n"}

It is, with variations, a part of the cuisine of many cultures. It is most often greyish-green or yellow in color depending on the regional variety of peas used; all are cultivars of \"Pisum sativum\".\n\nPea soup has been eaten since antiquity; it is mentioned in Aristophanes' \"The Birds\", and according to one source \"the Greeks and Romans were cultivating this legume about 500 to 400 BC. During that era, vendors in the streets of Athens were selling hot pea soup.\"\n\nEating fresh \"garden\" peas before they were matured was a luxurious innovation of the Early Modern period: by contrast with the coarse, traditional peasant fare of pease pottage, Potage Saint-Germain, made of fresh peas and other fresh greens braised in light stock and pureed, was an innovation sufficiently refined that it could be served to Louis XIV of France, for whose court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye it was named, ca 1660-80.\n\nA well-known nursery rhyme which first appeared in 1765 speaks of\n\n\"Pease\" is the Middle English singular and plural form of the word \"pea\"—indeed, \"pea\" began as a back-formation.\nPease pudding was a high-protein low-cost staple of the diet and, made from easily stored dried peas, was an ideal form of food for sailors, particularly boiled in accompaniment with salt pork which is the origin of pea (and ham) soup. Although pease was replaced as a staple by potatoes during the nineteenth century, the food still remains popular in the national diet in the form of \"mushy peas\" commonly sold as the typical accompaniment to fish and chips, as well as with meat pies.\n\nIn 19th-century English literature, pea soup is referred to as a simple food and eating it as a sign of poverty. In the Thackeray short story \"A Little Dinner at Timmins's\", when a character asks his wife \"Why don't you ask some of our old friends? Old Mrs. Portman has asked us twenty times, I am sure, within the last two years,\" she replies, with \"a look of ineffable scorn,\" that when \"the last time we went there, there was pea-soup for dinner!\" In Thomas Hardy's \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\", Tess remarks that \"we have several proofs that we are d'Urbervilles... we have a very old silver spoon, round in the bowl like a little ladle, and marked with the same castle. But it is so worn that mother uses it to stir the pea-soup.\"\n\nA soup of this sort made with yellow split-peas is called a London particular after the thick yellow smogs for which London was famous until the Clean Air Act.\n\n\"Soupe aux pois (jaunes)\" (yellow pea soup) is a traditional dish in Canadian cuisine. This split pea soup is very popular nationwide, but spread via Québécois cuisine;\ntraditional Québécois cuisine resembles early Maine and Vermont cuisines.\n\nOne source says \"The most authentic version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt pork, and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually chopped and returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice thinly and served separately... Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with small dumplings called dough boys or doughballs.\"\n\nA novel about nineteenth-century Canadian farmers by Louis Hémon, entitled \"Maria Chapdelaine\", depicts pea soup as common farmhouse fare:\n\nIn Newfoundland, split peas are cooked in a bag as part of a Jiggs dinner, which is known as pease pudding.\n\nOutside Francophone areas, pea soup is sometimes served with johnny cake. This is reflected in an old saying: \"pea soup and johnny cake makes a Frenchman's belly ache .\"\n\nPea soup is a common dish throughout Germany. It often contains meat such as bacon, sausage or \"Kassler\" (cured and smoked pork) depending on regional preferences. Very often, several Würste (Wurst meaning sausage) will accompany a serving of pea soup as well as some dark bread. Ready-made soup in cans is sometimes used to prepare the dish.\n\nOne of the very first instant products was a pea soup product, which mainly consisted of pea meal and beef fat (\"Erbswurst\": pea sausage). It was invented in 1867 by Johann Heinrich Grüneberg, who sold the recipe to the Prussian state. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, the war ministry, which had previously tested the possibility of feeding soldiers solely on instant pea soup and bread, built a large manufacturing plant and produced between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of Erbswurst for the army during the war. In 1889, the Knorr instant-food company bought the license. Knorr, which is today a Unilever brand, discontinued the production of Erbswurst on December 31, 2018.\n\n\"Erwtensoep\", also called \"snert\", is the Dutch version of pea soup. It is a thick stew of green split peas, different cuts of pork, celeriac or stalk celery, onions, leeks, carrots, and often potato. Slices of \"rookworst\" (smoked sausage) are added before serving. The soup, which is traditionally eaten during the winter, is emblematic of Dutch cuisine.\n\nIt is customarily served with Frisian rye bread (\"roggebrood\") and bacon, cheese or butter. The bacon is usually \"katenspek\", a variety of bacon which has been cooked and then smoked. Pancakes are sometimes served with pea soup; this dish is called \"snert met struif\", \"struif\" referring to the pancakes.\n\nIn the Royal Dutch Navy the pea soup is completed with small cubes of lard which float as white squares on top. It is therefore referred to as \"Snert met Drijfijs\" (pea soup with floating ice).\n\nSo-called koek-en-zopie outlets, small food and drinks stalls which spring up only during winters along frozen canals, ponds and lakes in the Netherlands and cater to ice skaters, usually serve \"snert\" as a savoury snack.\n\nIn Suriname, a former Dutch colony, Dutch-style pea soup is eaten as a street food.\n\nSwedish \"ärtsoppa\" ; Finnish \"hernekeitto\" ; Danish \"gule ærter\" ; Norwegian \"ertesuppe\";\n\nScandinavian pea soup is normally cooked with pork – although the meat may sometimes be served on the side – and a typical recipe would also include onions and herbs like thyme and marjoram.\n\nIn Finland the soup is made of green peas, in Sweden and Denmark yellow peas are used.\n\nIn Sweden and Finland the soup is usually served with mustard (considered an important part of the dish) on the side, as well as extra (dried) herbs (thyme or marjoram) to be mixed into the soup at the table. The soup is then normally followed by pancakes with jam (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, cloudberry or similar) which are regarded more as part of the meal than as a dessert. In Sweden, the soup sometimes is accompanied by warm (usually around 37°C) punsch as a special treat.\n\nConsumption of pea soup in Sweden and Finland dates back to at least the 13th century, and is traditionally served on Thursdays. This is said to originate in the pre-Reformation era, as preparation for fasting on Fridays. The tradition of Thursday pea soup is common in restaurants, schools, military messes and field kitchens, as well as in homes, and it forms an unpretentious but well-liked part of social life.\n\nThe Swedish king Eric XIV (1533-1577) is said to have died after eating arsenic-poisoned pea soup.\n\nIn Denmark, pea soup is not served with pancakes and the mustard is scooped up with rugbrød on the side. In addition, the dish is sometimes served with \"medisterpølse\", boiled potatoes and pickled beets and often turned into a feast, with copious amounts of beer and snaps on festive occasions.\n\nIn Denmark the dish can be dated to 1766 in written sources, but might have originated as early as the Bronze Age, when dried peas and cabbage became popular vegetables for the long winters there.\n\nIn Norway pea soup is traditionally served at springtime and easter, and is complemented with potatoes, carrots and vegetables.\n\nIn Poland, pea soup is typically associated with the military, where it still remains a popular dish. This is because pea soup is nutritious and cheap, and can be easily prepared in large quantities. Military pea soup (\"grochówka wojskowa\") is said to have to be thick enough to put a spoon straight up in it. Though the pea soup is normally prepared in messes, the dish is typically associated with field kitchens. Currently, decommissioned field kitchens are often used during mass events.\n\nIn the United States, \"pea soup\" without qualification usually means a perfectly smooth puree. \"Split Pea Soup\" is a slightly thinner soup with visible peas, pieces of ham or especially popular in the Northeast, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest. It does however play a role in the light-hearted tradition of serving green-colored foods on St. Patrick's Day. For example, a 1919 Boston Globe article suggests a suitable menu for \"A St. Patrick's Day Dinner\" leading off with \"Cream of Green Pea Soup (American Style),\" and continuing with codfish croquettes with green pea sauce, lettuce salad, pistachio ice cream, and \"green decorated cake.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "47863605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47863605", "title": "Middle Eastern cuisine", "text": "Middle Eastern cuisine\n\nMiddle Eastern cuisine is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of the Middle East. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity. It includes Arab, Iranian/Persian, Israeli/Jewish, Assyrian, Kurdish, Cypriot, and Turkish cuisines. In 2017, Middle Eastern cuisine was claimed by many sources to be one of the most popular and fastest growing ethnic cuisines in the US. Some commonly used ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, sumac, chickpeas, mint, rice, and parsley. Some popular dishes include kebabs, dolma, falafel, baklava, yogurt, doner kebab, shawarma and Mulukhiyah.\n\nThe Middle East includes the region formerly known as the Fertile Crescent (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers - Sumeria, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia), where wheat was first cultivated, followed by barley, pistachios, figs, pomegranates, dates and other regional staples. Fermentation was also discovered here to leaven bread and make beer in Mesopotamia, and the earliest written recipes come from that region also.\n\nAs a crossroads between Europe, Asia, the Caucasus and North Africa, this area has long been a hub of food and recipe exchange. During the first Persian Empire (ca. 550–330 BCE), the foundation was laid for modern Middle Eastern food when rice, poultry and various fruits were incorporated into the local diets. Figs, dates and nuts were brought by merchants to conquered lands, and spices were brought back from the Orient.\n\nThe area was also influenced by dumplings from Mongol invaders; turmeric, cumin, garlic and other spices from India; cloves, peppercorns and allspice from the Spice Islands; okra from Africa; and tomatoes from the New World, via the Moors of Spain. Religion has also influenced the cuisine; neither Jews nor Muslims eat pork, making lamb the primary meat. Since the Qur'an forbids alcohol consumption, wine and other drinks are made in countries such as Lebanon, where vineyards like Chateau Ksara, Chateau Kefraya and Chateau Masaya have gained international fame for their wines. Prior to its Islamic regime, Iran was also noted for its winemaking. Chateau Ksara is also very popular for its arak, an alcoholic drink produced in the Levant. Al-Maza is Lebanon's primary brewery, which was also, at one time, the Middle East's only beer-producing factory. Lebanon has always been well known in the region for its wines and arak, making it an exception when it comes to lack of alcohol in the region.\n\nUnder the Ottoman Empire, sweet pastries of paper thin phyllo dough and dense coffee were brought to the area.\n\nGrains constitute the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, both historically and today. Wheat and rice are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region and maize has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple—eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups—practically at every meal.\n\nAside from bread, wheat is also used in the forms of bulghur and couscous. Burghul is cracked wheat, made by partially cooking the wheat grains in water, drying it in an oven or in the sun, then breaking it into pieces, in different grades of size. Typically, it is cooked in water, with flavorings, much like rice. Burghul is also used in making meat pies and as an ingredient in salads, notably in tabbouleh, with chopped parsley, tomato, lemon, and oil. Freekeh is another common grain, made from immature green wheat.\n\nThere are many types of rice produced and consumed in the region. Plain rice is served under grilled meats or with meat/vegetable stews. In more complex rice dishes, there are layers of meat, vegetables, sauces, nuts, or dried fruits.\n\nButter and clarified butter (also known as smen) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products.\n\nMost regions in the Middle East use spices. Typically, a stew will include a small amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander. Black pepper is common, and chili peppers are used occasionally, especially as a separate sauce or as a pickle. Parsley and mint are commonly used both in cooking and in salads. Thyme and thyme blends (za'atar) are common in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, and a mixture of dried thyme and sumac (crushed sour berries) is a common breakfast item with oil and bread. Sumac is also sprinkled over grilled meat. Garlic is common to many dishes and salads.\n\nLamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of the Middle East. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or kebabs. There are a wide variety of these grills, with many regional specialties and styles. The most common are the cubed cuts on skewers, known as shish kebab in most places. Chicken may also be grilled in the same fashion. Another common variety is kofta kebab, made from ground meat, sometimes mixed with onions and spices, shaped around the skewer like a long sausage and grilled. Kebabs are typically a street or restaurant food, served with bread, salad, and pickles. It is not usually prepared in domestic kitchens.\n\nMeat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region. Kibbeh is a pie or dumpling made with meat and cereal. The most common are made with ground meat (typically lamb) and burghul, worked together like a dough, then stuffed with minced meat that has been fried with onion, aromatics, and, sometimes, pine nuts or almonds and raisins. This can either be in the form of individual small dumplings (usually shaped like a torpedo), or in slices like a cake, baked on an oven tray with the stuffing placed between two layers of the dough. One variation is kibbeh naye, raw kibbeh, which is made by pounding raw meat and burghul together with seasoning and served with dips of lemon juice and chili sauce.\n\nVegetables and pulses are the predominant staple of the great majority of the people in the Middle East. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and with rice. Among the green leaf vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common. Squash, tomato, eggplants, and okra are distinctive elements in the cookery of the region. (Use your own discretion with this commentary, as Squash and tomatoes originate from the Americas, and are not 'distinctive' to the region as the above suggested.) Eggplant is often fried in slices and dressed in yogurt and garlic, or roasted over an open fire, then pulped and dressed with tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and cumin, a dish known as baba ghanoush. Tomato is the most ubiquitous ingredient in Middle Eastern cookery. It is used fresh in a variety of salads, cooked in almost every stew and broth, and grilled with kebab.\n\nBeans and pulses are crucial to the diet of the region, second only to cereals. Fava beans are eaten both green and dried. Dried, they are boiled into one of the most popular Egyptian foods: ful medames, a domestic and street food, eaten for breakfast or any other meal, mashed and dressed in oil, lemon, and chili. Similar dishes are found in all other parts of the region. The famous Falafel, now popular in Europe and America, was originally made from dried fava, crushed and formed into a rissole with herbs and spices, then fried. It is also made from chickpeas or a mixture of the two. Green fava are cooked like other green beans, boiled and dressed in oil, or stewed with meat. The haricot beans and black-eyed beans are also common. Lentils, split peas, and chickpeas are widely used in soups, with rice, in salads, or with meat. Hummus, made from chickpeas and sesame paste, originated in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nStuffed vegetables are a dish most associated with the Middle East in the popular mind. They are commonly called dolma, the Turkish word meaning \"stuffed,\" but also the Arabic mahshi. Grape leaves, chard, and cabbage are stuffed with rice, ground meat, pine nuts, and spices, and then stewed in oil and tomato. Many vegetables are similarly stuffed and stewed or baked, such as squash, onion, tomato, eggplant, peppers, and even carrots.\n\nMezze is common throughout the Middle East. It consists of a number of small dishes that are picked at leisure: cheese, melon, nuts, various salads and dips, such as tabbouleh, hummus and mutabbal, pickles, and also more substantial items, such as grilled meat, kibbeh, and sausage.\n\nArabs commonly consume milk, fresh or soured. Yogurt, a Turkish contribution, is commonly consumed plain, used in cooking, used in salad dressing, or diluted as a drink. White cheeses, like the Greek feta and halloumi, are the most common in the region.\n\nTurkish coffee is the most well known beverage of the region. It is thicker than regular coffee and is made by boiling finely ground coffee in water and then letting the grounds settle. In the 1980s, instant coffee also became popular. Aside from coffee, there is also an alcoholic drink called arak. It is most famous for its potency and milky-white color when water is added, producing the drink nicknamed \"the milk of lions\". Water and ice are almost always added because of an alcohol content between 30% and 60%. Arak is colorless in its pure form and is aniseed-flavored. In the Middle East, arak is served in social settings and with mezze. Some Christians in the Middle East, such as the Assyrians and Armenians produce their own home made beer and wine. A common drink among Muslims served during Ramadan is Qamar El Deen, a thick and sweet apricot drink. The apricots are boiled with sugar and water until they are thick and placed on wooden planks left in the sun until dry. A fruit leather is left, which is then melted with water and sugar and drunk. Another popular drink is Jallab. It is made by diluting a mixture grape molasses, dates, and rose water and served with crushed ice. Some also serve it with raisins or pine nuts. Ayran (and Doogh) is a beverage made from yogurt very popular in certain Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey and Iran.\n\nIn some Arab countries of the Middle East, especially in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, it is common for people to take their food from a communal plate in the center of the table. Rather than employing forks or spoons, people traditionally dine without utensils; they scoop up food with their thumb and two fingers or pita bread. In the Arab culture, the left hand is considered unclean. This however is changing now with utensils being widely used for dining. Even left-handed people eat only with the right hand. A common exception is that the left hand may be used to hold a drinking glass when eating greasy food with the right. It is proper etiquette to compliment the host on the food and their hospitality. Similarly, it is important to try every plate on the table. If a guest does not leave food on his plate, the host generally fills it immediately. The Middle East places emphasis on enjoying meals with family and friends.\n\nIn Iran, the term \"daste shoma dard nakone\" [literally 'may your hand not hurt'] is used to thank someone. Similarly, in Iranian Azerbaijan the term \"eliz ağırmasın\" is used, with the same meaning.\n\nTypically, dishes are served according to savoury or sweet, rather than in courses. Food is served in various platters and dishes at a dining table, served in plates, and eaten with cutlery, as is the European tradition. In traditional Iranian restaurants, a large, low table lined with Persian rugs and with cushions around the sides is the setting for feasting; people sit cross-legged in a circle, and food is served in the centre, again eaten with cutlery in separate plates. Afterwards, tea will be served in \"kamar baareek\" glasses [literally 'narrow waist'] with sugar lumps, Persian sweets, and possibly a ghalyoun, enjoyed in the same communal fashion.\n\nWhen entertaining dinner guests at home, it is seen as discourteous to one's guests to serve the sufficient amount of food for all guests, lest one appears miserly. For this reason, food is always prepared lavishly and in large quantities.\n\nAn important Persian concept that applies to food and also extends to other areas of daily life is the practice of \"taarof\"; this is an exercise of self-restraint, whereby if one is offered any food or drink, they will initially politely decline, regardless of how hungry or thirsty they might be. Once the host has insisted and offered repeatedly, they will help themselves. No food and drink is to be accepted upon the first time of being offered it, lest one appears greedy.\n\n\nDuring the month of Ramadan, food consumption increases dramatically throughout Muslim communities. Breaking the fast becomes a banquet, with exchanges of invitations between kin and friends, and public banquets held by charities and associations. Cafes and pastry shops are open at night, and a carnival atmosphere prevails in the streets. Many Muslims, following the reported example of Muhammad, break their fast with a date, followed by a variety of dishes. Sweet pastries and puddings are always present on Ramadan nights everywhere. The end of Ramadan is marked by a festival, Id 'al-Fitr, a feast that breaks the fast, during which a great quantity and variety of sweets and pastries are consumed. The other major Muslim feast is that of 'Id al-Adha, the feast of the sacrifice, which occurs during the pilgrimage month. At this time an animal, usually a sheep or a goat, is slaughtered in every household that can afford it, and great banquets are prepared, with an obligation to give food to the poor.\n\nIn North America, Middle Eastern food first came became popular in the 1990s with the so-called Mediterranean diet. According to the Mayo Clinic, the benefits included reduced risks of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease and cancer.\n\n"}
{"id": "47863615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47863615", "title": "Bulgur", "text": "Bulgur\n\nBulgur (from ; also burghul, from \"bourghoul\", \"groats\") is a cereal food made from the cracked parboiled groats of several different wheat species, most often from \"durum\" wheat. It originates in Middle Eastern cuisine.\n\nBulgur is recognized as a whole grain by the United States Department of Agriculture. Bulgur is sometimes confused with cracked wheat, which is crushed wheat grain that, unlike bulgur, has not been parboiled. Bulgur is a common ingredient in cuisines of many countries of the Middle East and Mediterranean Basin. It has a light, nutty flavor. \n\nA distinction is made between different grinds of bulgur: #1 fine, #2 medium, #3 coarse and #4 extra coarse. The highest quality bulgur has particle sizes that are uniform.\n\nBulgur does not require cooking, although it can be included in cooked dishes; soaking in water is all that is needed.\n\nCoarse bulgur is used to make pottages, while the medium and fine grains are used for breakfast cereals, salads such as kısır, pilavs, breads, and in dessert puddings such as \"kheer\". Bulgur porridge is similar to frumenty, a cracked wheat porridge that was a staple of medieval cuisine.\n\nIn breads, it adds a whole-grain component. It is a main ingredient in kibbeh and, soaked but not cooked, in tabbouleh salad. It is often used where rice or couscous could be used. In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bulgur is often used as a cereal to make a porridge with milk and sugar, or a savory porridge with vegetables and spices. It can be used to accompany other dishes in the same way as pasta or rice; it may be mistaken for rice because it has a similar appearance, although the texture is different.\n\nArmenians prepare bulgur as a pilaf in chicken stock, with or without sauteed noodles, or cooked with tomatoes, onions, herbs and red pepper. The fine grind is used for making eech, a bulgur salad similar to tabbouleh, prepared with tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley, olive oil, and other salad ingredients to personal taste. Pomegranate molasses, which is sour and sweet, is commonly used instead of lemon juice to add tartness. A variety of mezes and main dishes are prepared. \n\nIn Cyprus, it is known as \"πουρκούρι\" and is used to make \"κούπες\" (also known as \"bulgur köftesi\" in Cypriot Turkish), a variety of kibbeh. Its crust is usually made of bulgur wheat, flour, oil, salt and egg, then filled with ground meat (beef and/or pork), onions, parsley and spices. There is also vegetarian \"κούπες\" which substitutes the ground meat with chopped mushrooms.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian version of bulgur, popular in Nejd and Al-Hasa, is known as \"jarish\".\n\n"}

The \"ko\" or portion in these names literally means \"fragrant\", and the term was used as a \"nyōbō kotoba\" or \"woman's word\" for miso in reference to the smell. Over time, this term was also applied to pickles, again for the smell. \"Oshinko\" (literally \"new fragrance\" in reference to relative freshness) more specifically referred to vegetables that had been only lightly pickled and that had not yet changed color that much. The term is now also used more broadly to refer to pickles in general.\n\nTo make tsukemono, one needs a container, salt, and something to apply downward pressure on top of the pickles.\n\nA (literally \"pickling container\") is a Japanese pickle press. The pressure is generated by heavy stones called (literally \"pickle stone\") with a weight of one to two kilograms, sometimes more. This type of pickle press is still in use, and can be made from a variety of materials, such as plastic, wood, glass or ceramic. Before \"tsukemono ishi\" came into use, the pressure was applied by driving a wedge between a handle of the container and its lid.\n\nThe weights are either stone or metal, with a handle on top and often covered with a layer of food-neutral plastic. Another modern type of pickle press is usually made from plastic, and the necessary pressure is generated by turning a screw and clamping down onto the pickles.\n\nAsazuke is a pickling method characterized by its short preparation time.\n\nTakuan (daikon), umeboshi (ume plum), turnip, cucumber, and Chinese cabbage are among the favorites to be eaten with rice as an accompaniment to a meal.\n\nBeni shōga (red ginger pickled in umeboshi brine) is used as a garnish on okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba.\n\nGari (thinly sliced young ginger that has been marinated in a solution of sugar and vinegar) is used between dishes of sushi to cleanse the palate.\n\nRakkyōzuke (a type of onion) is often served with Japanese curry.
